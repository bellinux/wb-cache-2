40|$|International audienceIDH {{mutations}} {{are found}} in the majority of adult, diffuse, low-grade and anaplastic gliomas and are also frequently found in cartilaginous tumors. Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are two <b>enchondromatosis</b> syndromes characterized by the development of multiple benign cartilaginous tumors due to post-zygotic acquisition of IDH mutations. In addition to skeletal tumors, <b>enchondromatosis</b> patients sometimes develop gliomas. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine whether gliomas in <b>enchondromatosis</b> patients might also result from somatic IDH mosaicism and whether their characteristics are similar to those of sporadic IDH-mutated gliomas. For this purpose, we analyzed the characteristics of 6 newly diagnosed and 32 previously reported cases of <b>enchondromatosis</b> patients who developed gliomas and compared them to those of a consecutive series of 159 patients with sporadic IDH-mutated gliomas. As was the case with sporadic IDH mutated gliomas, <b>enchondromatosis</b> gliomas were frequently located in the frontal lobe (54 %) and consisted of diffuse low-grade (73 %) or anaplastic gliomas (21 %). However, they were diagnosed at an earlier age (25. 6 years versus 44 years, p < 0. 001) and were more frequently multicentric (32 % versus 1 %, p < 0. 001) and more frequently located within the brainstem than sporadic IDH mutated gliomas (21 % versus 1 %, p < 0. 001). Their molecular profile was characterized by IDH mutations and loss of ATRX expression. In two patients, the same IDH mutation was demonstrated in the glioma and in a cartilaginous tumor. In contrast to sporadic IDH mutated gliomas, no <b>enchondromatosis</b> glioma harbored a 1 p/ 19 q co-deletion (0 / 6 versus 59 / 123, p = 0. 03). The characteristics of gliomas in patients with <b>enchondromatosis</b> suggest that these tumors, as cartilaginous tumors, result from somatic IDH mosaicism and that the timing of IDH mutation acquisition might affect the location and molecular characteristics of gliomas. Early acquisition of IDH mutations could shift gliomagenesis towards the brainstem thereby mimicking the regional preference of histone mutated gliomas...|$|E
40|$|<b>Enchondromatosis</b> is a rare, {{heterogeneous}} skeletal {{disorder in}} which patients have multiple enchondromas. Enchondromas are benign hyaline cartilage forming tumors in the medulla of metaphyseal bone. The disorder manifests itself early in childhood without any significant gender bias. <b>Enchondromatosis</b> encompasses several different subtypes of which Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome are most common, {{while the other}} subtypes (metachondromatosis, genochondromatosis, spondyloenchondrodysplasia, dysspondyloenchondromatosis and cheirospondyloenchondromatosis) are extremely rare. Most subtypes are non-hereditary, while some are autosomal dominant or recessive. The gene(s) causing the different <b>enchondromatosis</b> syndromes are largely unknown. They should be distinguished and adequately diagnosed, not only to guide therapeutic decisions and genetic counseling, but also with respect to research into their etiology. For a longtime enchondromas have been considered a developmental disorder caused {{by the failure of}} normal endochondral bone formation. With the identification of genetic abnormalities in enchondromas however, they were being thought of as neoplasms. Active hedgehog signaling is reported to be important for enchondroma development and PTH 1 R mutations have been identified in ∼ 10 % of Ollier patients. One can therefore speculate that the gene(s) causing the different <b>enchondromatosis</b> subtypes are involved in hedgehog/PTH 1 R growth plate signaling. Adequate distinction within future studies will shed light on whether these subtypes are different ends of a spectrum caused by a single gene, or that they represent truely different diseases. We therefore review the available clinical information for all <b>enchondromatosis</b> subtypes and discuss the little molecular data available hinting towards their cause...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Enchondromas {{are common}} intraosseous, usually benign {{cartilaginous}} tumors, that develop {{in close proximity}} to growth plate cartilage. When multiple enchondromas are present, the condition is called <b>enchondromatosis</b> also known as Ollier disease (WHO terminology). The estimated prevalence of Ollier disease is 1 / 100, 000. Clinical manifestations often appear {{in the first decade of}} life. Ollier disease is characterized by an asymmetric distribution of cartilage lesions and these can be extremely variable (in terms of size, number, location, evolution of enchondromas, age of onset and of diagnosis, requirement for surgery). Clinical problems caused by enchondromas include skeletal deformities, limb-length discrepancy, and the potential risk for malignant change to chondrosarcoma. The condition in which multiple <b>enchondromatosis</b> is associated with soft tissue hemangiomas is known as Maffucci syndrome. Until now both Ollier disease and Maffucci syndrome have only occurred in isolated patients and not familial. It remains uncertain whether the disorder is caused by a single gene defect or by combinations of (germ-line and/or somatic) mutations. The diagnosis is based on clinical and conventional radiological evaluations. Histological analysis has a limited role and is mainly used if malignancy is suspected. There is no medical treatment for <b>enchondromatosis.</b> Surgery is indicated in case of complications (pathological fractures, growth defect, malignant transformation). The prognosis for Ollier disease is difficult to assess. As is generally the case, forms with an early onset appear more severe. Enchondromas in Ollier disease present a risk of malignant transformation of enchondromas into chondrosarcomas. </p...|$|E

40|$|Metachondromatosis (MC) is a rare, {{autosomal}} dominant, incompletely penetrant combined exostosis and <b>enchondromatosis</b> tumor syndrome. MC is clinically {{distinct from}} other multiple exostosis or multiple <b>enchondromatosis</b> syndromes and is unlinked to EXT 1 and EXT 2, the genes responsible for autosomal dominant multiple osteochondromas (MO). To identify a gene for MC, we performed linkage analysis with high-density SNP arrays {{in a single}} family, used a targeted array to capture exons and promoter sequences from the linked interval in 16 participants from 11 MC families, and sequenced the captured DNA using high-throughput parallel sequencing technologies. DNA capture and parallel sequencing identified heterozygous putative loss-of-function mutations in PTPN 11 in 4 of the 11 families. Sanger sequence analysis of PTPN 11 coding regions {{in a total of}} 17 MC families identified mutations in 10 of them (5 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 splice-site mutations). Copy number analysis of sequencing reads from a second targeted capture that included the entire PTPN 11 gene identified an additional family with a 15 kb deletion spanning exon 7 of PTPN 11. Microdissected MC lesions from two patients with PTPN 11 mutations demonstrated loss-of-heterozygosity for the wild-type allele. We next sequenced PTPN 11 in DNA samples from 54 patients with the multiple <b>enchondromatosis</b> disorders Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome, but found no coding sequence PTPN 11 mutations. We conclude that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PTPN 11 are a frequent cause of MC, that lesions in patients with MC appear to arise following a "second hit," that MC may be locus heterogeneous since 1 familial and 5 sporadically occurring cases lacked obvious disease-causing PTPN 11 mutations, and that PTPN 11 mutations are not a common cause of Ollier disease or Maffucci syndrome...|$|E

30|$|Multiple <b>enchondromatosis</b> (Ollier’s disease) is {{a common}} intraosseous benign {{cartilaginous}} tumour that develops {{in close proximity to}} the growth plate.

Conventional treatment is curettage and bone grafting which may result in severe deformities requiring repeated osteotomies. It is often difficult to obtain adequate stabilization and normal bone growth by autogenous bone grafting. Jesus-Garcia et al.

They reported excellent results and claimed the technique led to conversion of the abnormal cartilage to histologically mature bone in all their patients [18]. In this series all cases had accurate deformity correction with stable and mature bony regenerate. Three of the four cases had residual shortening (0.5  cm) that was not significant. One developed a knee contracture that resolved with physiotherapy.

Pa-tients with Ollier’s disease have limb length inequality and angular deformities and require multiple reconstructive procedures owing to a high incidence of recurrence. We identified a tendency for the osteotomy to prematurely con-solidate and advise the latency period after surgery to be 4 – 5 days and for distraction to proceed at a faster rate...|$|E
40|$|A {{child who}} had {{multiple}} fibrocartilaginous lesions of the bone and hemangiomas and tipomas in the soft tissues has been followed at the Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh for five years with the diagnosis of Maffucci’s syndrome. A mass recently removed from the right patetla consisted of fibrocartilage which was at {{the periphery of the}} involved bone. It raised {{the question of whether the}} case truly repre-sents Maffucci’s syndrome. ferring to the various disorders in the spectrum. Jaffe popularized the use of the term “multiple enchondroma-tosis ’ ‘ for disease and Maffucci’s syndrome, and stated that ‘ ‘The term ‘Maffucci’s syndrome ’ has been applied to cases of multiple <b>enchondromatosis</b> (or ‘dys-chondroplasia’) associated with hemangiomata ’ ‘. The child whose case we are reporting had parosteal fibrocar-tilaginous lesions and soft-tissue hemangiornas and The right ilium is larger than the left one and there is marked expansion of the right femonal neck, with cortical irregularity and severe coxa valga deformity. Although there is agreement that Maffucci’s syn-dromet and related disorders represent a spectrum of mesenchymal dysplasiat. tH. 14, there is no consensus on the precise definition of the constellation of lesions, found in Maffucci’s syndrome or the best terms to be used in re...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} prevalence, geographic distribution and mutation spectrum of genetic skeletal disorders (GSDs) in China. This study systematically reviewed GSDs as defined in “Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders (2010 version) ” using Chinese biomedical literature published over the past 34 years from 1978 to 2012. In total, 16, 099 GSDs have been reported. The most frequently reported disorders were Marfan syndrome, osteogenesis imperfecta, fibrous dysplasia, mucopolysaccharidosis, multiple cartilaginous exostoses, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF 1), osteopetrosis, achondroplasia, <b>enchondromatosis</b> (Ollier), and osteopoikilosis, accounting for 76. 5 % (12, 312 cases) of the total cases. Five groups (group 8, 12, 14, 18, 21) defined by “Nosology and Classification of genetic skeletal disorders” have not been reported in the Chinese biomedical literature. Gene mutation testing was performed in only a minor portion of the 16, 099 cases of GSDs (187 cases, 1. 16 %). In total, 37 genes for 41 different GSDs were reported in Chinese biomedical literature, including 43 novel mutations. This review revealed a significant imbalance in rare disease identification in terms of geographic regions and hospital levels, suggesting the need to create a national multi-level network to meet the specific challenge of care for rare diseases in China. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fibrous {{dysplasia}} (FD) is a monostotic or polyostotic benign bone lesion with spindle-cell proliferation in woven {{bone and}} stroma. Rarely, cartilaginous differentiation {{can be seen}} in the lesions of FD. FD with massive cartilaginous differentiation is called fibrocartilaginous dysplasia (FCD) and is considered a rare variant of FD. Although pathological findings of FD show irregular immature bone formation without osteoblastic rimming in fibrous tissue, and rarely show very small amounts of cartilage, histological images of FCD are said to show that cartilage with a relatively high cell density is present in the majority and that FD-like findings are seen in parts of it. The most characteristic feature of FCD on images is calcification in the lesions reflecting cartilaginous tissue. On the other hand, typical radiographic findings of FD include shadows with a ground-glass appearance and thinning and bulging of the cortical bone, the observation if calcification is not usual. Therefore, in the diagnosis of FCD, differentiation from multiple <b>enchondromatosis,</b> Ollier disease, chondrosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma secondary to FD is necessary, and it seems important to make a careful diagnosis based not only on the pathological findings but also on imaging and clinical findings. Herein, we report on a case of FD of the proximal femur associated with intralesional extensive cartilaginous differentiation in which a pathological fracture occurred during follow-up, with a review of the literature...|$|E
