The <b>fire</b> <b>effects</b> were {{supervised}} by Chris Corbould, and post-production MPC had {{to enhance the}} sequence by making the smoke look closer to the actors, so it would look more dangerous. A full-scale replica of the building's exterior {{was used for the}} exploding part Bond and Camille escape from.|$|E
25|$|In KOF '94, Ralf and Clark {{shared the}} same set of Special Moves, with only their Super Special Move being different. His {{original}} Special Moves included the Vulcan Punch (a rapid punch attack with <b>fire</b> <b>effects),</b> the Gatling Attack (a rushing series of punches), and the Super Argentine Back Breaker (in which Ralf tosses his opponent in the air and catches him). In KOF '95, he gain one new Special Move, the , in which Ralf jumps in the air and dives towards the opponent. In KOF '97, he gains the Ralf Kick, and in KOF '99 the Ralf Tackle. In KOF 2003, he loses the Ralf Tackle, but gains the Stealth Ralf Kick and the Unblock. His Super Special Move in KOF '94, is the Super Vulcan Punch, a more powerful version of the Vulcan Punch, while in KOF '96 he gains the Bareback Vulcan Punch, a version of the Super Vulcan Punch in which Ralf pins his opponent into the ground and unleashes a flurry of punches. In KOF '97, he gains the Galactica Phantom, a single but powerful punch which sends the enemy flying across the screen. In KOF 2002, he uses the Bareback Galactica Phantom as MAX2 move (a maximum level Super Special move), with an additional follow up gained in 2002 Unlimited Match which, at times, can lead to an instant kill. In KOF XIII, he gets the Jet Vulcan, a variant of the Super Vulcan Punch in which Ralf turns red with rage and unleashes a flurry of punches in front of him. In KOF XIV, he get the Ralf Super Phalanx, a combination of the Jet Vulcan and Galactica Phantom where Ralf unleashes eight punches in front of him which, if the last punch hits, will make his opponent stagger, allowing Ralf to finish off his opponent with a highly explosive straight.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{developed}} a modified <b>fire</b> <b>effect</b> model for representing the psychological pressure {{caused by the}} flame and smoke. Then, we applied the developed model on FDS+Evac to analyze the evacuation characteristics. When the developed model is used, the evacuees are distributed further away from the fire because the evacuees change the movement direction to evacuate safely. Therefore, the modified <b>fire</b> <b>effect</b> model is more reliable than the Helbing's model because some evacuees are move through the fire source when the Helbing's model is used. However, the additional studies are required for improving {{the reality of the}} modified <b>fire</b> <b>effect</b> model...|$|R

The digital color correction was supervised by Stefan Sonnenfeld.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} create the [...] "Lava Face" [...] effect, actor Jay Underwood's face was painted green. A mask with pre-cut slits was then placed over the skin. Underwood then tore the mask off of his own face, {{revealing}} streaks of the green coloring. A matte of the scene was then cut and various <b>fire</b> <b>effects</b> were placed into Underwood's face via green screen technology. In {{order to make the}} [...] "cracks" [...] appear, digital technology was created to [...] "smooth over" [...] the skin and then slowly reveal the pre-cut slits. Producer Paul Rabwin later joked that Underwood [...] "had fire for brains".|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the aliens, other visual effects were required for the speeders, the alien spaceship, its interior, environment re-creations, and the head-up display for Jake's arm gauntlet. For {{the invasion of the}} town of Absolution, both practical laser lighting and <b>fire</b> <b>effects</b> were utilized, along with practical ships and effects enhancements. ILM artists had to enhance the initial look of the alien [...] "bolos", the cables used to abduct people, with renderings such as extra lights, after viewers thought the studio had failed to [...] "paint out" [...] the cables in the film’s first trailer. For a scene in which Jake and Ella ride on a speeder, the actors were filming on a practical mock-up against bluescreen; they were digitally replaced in wider shots.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the {{commencement}} of construction, Sea World announced a new attraction for 2013 and released a promotional image on their Facebook page which read [...] "The storm is building. It's gonna be a big one.". Demolition works began in August 2012. Due to this construction, nearby attractions, including Viking's Revenge Flume Ride, Jet Rescue and the Skyway, were intermittently closed throughout {{the latter part of}} 2012 and into 2013. The first pieces of ride track arrived on site in April 2013, with vertical construction commencing in the following month. An official announcement for Storm Coaster made by Sea World in May 2013 detailed the ride would feature [...] of track and a series of water and <b>fire</b> <b>effects.</b> Although an opening date of September 2013 was initially set, Sea World later revised this to be Summer 2013. By September 2013, the ride's track was complete, with focus moving towards theming and testing the ride. On 2 December 2013, Storm Coaster soft opened to the public, with an official opening held four days later.|$|E
500|$|Superman: Ride of Steel was re-themed as Bizarro at {{the start}} of the 2009 season. Six Flags had to work with the Zoning Board of Appeals to file a permit for the new effects because the ride sits on the Connecticut River floodplain. Although no changes were made to the track layout, a new theme {{highlighting}} Superman's evil clone, Bizarro, was added. The track was repainted purple with dark blue supports, and multiple special effects were added; including building structures that give riders the impression of speeding through a city, rings in the shape of Bizarro's S shield that the train passes through, and flame effects. The two trains were repainted purple with new on-board audio. Six Flags introduced an [...] "alternate reality game" [...] to market the newly themed ride. Bizarro opened on May 22, 2009, {{at the start}} of Memorial Day weekend. Since the transformation, some of the effects have been removed. The <b>fire</b> <b>effects</b> were removed and moved to the New Texas Giant at Six Flags Over Texas.|$|E
500|$|The {{roller coaster}} {{begins in the}} station, which is built {{to look like a}} {{partially}} destroyed church, and climbs up a [...] chain lift hill. Upon reaching the top of the lift hill, the track twists 180 degrees anticlockwise, so that riders are upside down, before plunging down the world's first dive drop element. The train then proceeds to dive under the wing of a wrecked plane and into a zero-g roll [...] above the ground before passing through a billboard, immediately following which the on-ride photo is taken. It then enters an inclined loop [...] in height. It then enters a turnaround with a wrecked helicopter with slow-spinning rotor blades in the centre. This is followed by a corkscrew, which passes through the inclined loop. Upon leaving the corkscrew, the train curves past a crashed fire engine with water and <b>fire</b> <b>effects</b> and proceeds through a keyhole: a partly destroyed church tower. The ride then flies over the station and enters into a last inline twist before a mid-course brake run. Following this, the train makes a banked left-hand turn into the final brakes. The train then goes back into the station. The ride previously featured an on-ride video camera, filming riders and allowing the purchase of a DVD afterwards; this was removed sometime in 2016.|$|E

30|$|Extractable organic carbon. In the high-elevation {{restored}} site, fire {{increased the}} extractable TOC from (350 ± 17) mg TOC kg− 1 soil (control plot) to (451 ± 25) mg TOC kg− 1 soil (P < 0.05). Although {{there was no}} <b>fire</b> <b>effect</b> on TOC one month post fire, an additional 64 mg TOC kg− 1 soil was quantified in burned sites after one year (P < 0.05; Table 1). In contrast, {{there was no immediate}} <b>fire</b> <b>effect</b> (≤ 1 month) on extractable TOC at the lower elevation restored site, although concentrations decreased by 82 mg TOC kg− 1 soil in burned plots relative to control plots one year following the fire (P < 0.05; Table 1).|$|R
40|$|Pyrogenic carbon {{emission}} rates were estimated in the soils of three natural zones in Russia: forest-tundra, south-taiga, and forest-steppe. Postfire soils {{were found to}} be characterized by essential losses of soil C due to the combustion <b>fire</b> <b>effect.</b> Soils lost 3 or 5 parts of initial carbon content and showed an essential decrease in the C/N ratio during the <b>fire</b> <b>effect.</b> The pH values increased due to soil enrichment by ash during the fire events. CO 2 emission rates were highest in natural soil samples, because the amount of organic matter affected by mineralization in those soils was higher than in natural ones. Simultaneously, the total values of mineralized carbon were higher in postfire soils because the SOM quality and composition were altered due to the <b>fire</b> <b>effect.</b> The only exception was in forest-tundra soils, where a high portion of dissolved organic compounds was released during the surface fire. The quality of initial SOM and intensity of the wildfire play the most important roles in the fate of SOM in postfire environments. Further study of CO 2 emissions is needed to better characterize postfire SOM dynamics and develop an approach to model this process...|$|R
500|$|Filming {{happened}} {{mostly in}} Los Angeles, including location shooting at Sunset Strip, Silver Lake, Pacific Palisades, the Hollywood Hills and the Biltmore Hotel. Id Club, the nightclub {{featured in the}} film, was built within Hollywood's Pantages Theater, while the hills above Dodger Stadium near Elysian Park {{were used for the}} car chase and crash where Sil fakes her death. For the opening scenes in Utah, the Tooele Army Depot dubbed as the outside of the research facility—the interiors were shot at the Rockwell International Corporation laboratory in California—and a Victorian-era train station in Brigham City was part of Sil's escape. Other locations included the [...] Santa Monica Pier and the Arecibo telescope in Puerto Rico. The most complex sets involved the sewer complex and a tar-filled granite cavern where the ending occurs. Donaldson wanted a maze quality for the sewers, which had traces of realism (such as tree roots breaking through from the ceiling) and artistic licenses. Production designer John Muto intentionally designed the sewers wider and taller than real ones, as well as with walkways, but nevertheless aiming for a claustrophobic and realistic atmosphere. The underground tunnels were built out of structural steel, metal rod, plaster and concrete to endure the <b>fire</b> <b>effects,</b> and had its design based on the La Brea Tar Pits, with Muto describing them as [...] "just the sort of place in which a creature from another planet might feel at home." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the sequence of structural breakup of the airplane, the NTSB formed the Sequencing Group, which examined individual pieces of the recovered structure, two-dimensional reconstructions or layouts of sections of the airplane, and various-sized three-dimensional reconstructions of portions of the airplane. In addition, the locations of pieces of wreckage {{at the time of}} recovery and differences in <b>fire</b> <b>effects</b> on pieces that are normally adjacent to each other were evaluated. The Sequencing Group concluded that the first event in the breakup sequence was a fracture in the wing center section of the aircraft, caused by an [...] "overpressure event" [...] in the center wing fuel tank (CWT). An overpressure event was defined as a rapid increase in pressure resulting in failure {{of the structure of the}} CWT.|$|E
