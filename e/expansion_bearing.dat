40|$|Ever {{since the}} first mobile {{telephone}} call was made by a Motorola researcher in 1973, mobile technology has been growing rapidly to facilitate diverse ubiquitous services. Although cell based radio technology has proved beneficial for reliable long distance transmission, it is faced with challenges when deployed in an indoor environment. With the introduction of white LED - based communication entities {{at the start of}} the 21 st century, radio and other technologies have become more interdependent, with the possibility for further <b>expansion.</b> <b>Bearing</b> in mind the sophistication offered, with the rapid developments witnessed in mobile telecommunications, this thesis presents an innovative alternative for cell phone connectivity in RF restricted or poor signal connectivity region. To address the research objective of offering uninterrupted signal connectivity in an indoor environment, the term Radio on Visible Light (RoVL) was introduced in this research. Furthermore, five major attributes influencing mobile signal transmission through visible light channels were identified and addressed. The bandwidth constraint offered by a white LED was tackled with an intelligent technique of frequency translation and mapping. In addition, an electronic predistorter was designed and implemented to address the nonlinearity in an LED. For efficient data manipulation, subcarrier continuous phase technique of modulation was introduced and hardware implemented for visible light communication, with a discussion on the LED number and arrangement for efficient illumination and data transmission. Despite the presence of significant research contributions in visible light technology, the study here is specifically focussed on integrating the GSM network with that of the optical wireless systems. The existing visible light entities provide service users with a one way broadband data transmission hub, unlike the dual channel support rendered by the RoVL device as presented in this research. The techniques proposed, backed up with interesting research observations and experimental results, clearly demonstrate the capability of supporting mobile communication through optical wireless channels. The methods proposed and techniques discussed shall lay foundation in supplementing the radio based mobile technology with optical wireless entities, opening new avenues for further research & development in this direction...|$|E
40|$|The main {{topic of}} this thesis was to {{evaluate}} the relevance of immune-tolerance dys-regulation in the pathogenesis of some haematopoietic disorders and for the occurrence of immune pathological complications in chronic infection models. In Paroxysmal Nocturnal Haemoglobinuria model, we described the occurrence of Treg reduction and NKTi increase in untreated PNH patients {{as well as the}} ability of the Complement blocking monoclonal antibody culizumab to selectively restore B and NKTi peripheral concentration without significant interference on NK and Treg numbers. In MyeloDysplastic Syndromes model, the study focused on HLA-E and HLA-I molecules, key elements for NK and Cytotoxic T cell recognition. We consistently found that a subgroup of Low and Int- 1 Risk MDS patients, categorised according with their altered immune profile, (low Treg level and high CD 54 expression on CD 8 T cell effectors in BM) showed significant decrease of HLA-I expression on peripheral PMN. This observation indicate the occurrence of CD 8 -dependent selection in BM. In addiction, the presence of polyclonal NK <b>expansion</b> <b>bearing</b> an activating receptor able to recognise HLA-E in BM has been observed to associate with the selection of dysplastic precursors lacking HLA-E expression. In chronic infection model, as represented by natural infection by Leishmania Infantum in dogs we described a significant increase of CTL and TH 1 cells accompanied by reduction of Tregs. The possibility that such condition might be relevant for the occurrence of autoimmune platelet deficiency, frequently observed in Leishmania infected dogs has been hypothesised. In this model, pharmacological treatment associated with administration of a diet supplemented with nutraceuticals selected for their potential immune modulating properties and rich in essential fatty acids was observed to induce restoration of Treg and a progressive decrease of TH 1 CD 4 + T cells. The possibility that such immune-modulating effects could affect the occurrence of immune-mediated platelet deficiency is currently under investigation. In SOD 1 model, we suggested that SOD- 1 is part of the network of molecules involved in antigen-dependent T cell response. Indeed, we described that antigen-dependent activation of human T lymphocytes significantly increased extracellular SOD- 1 levels in lymphocyte cultures. This effect was accompanied by the synthesis of SOD- 1 -specific mRNA and by the induction of microvesicle SOD- 1 secretion. Moreover, confocal microscopy showed that antigen-dependent activation was able to modify SOD- 1 intracellular localization in T cells, allowing association of the enzyme with the intracellular network of signalling molecules involved in TCR-dependent signal transduction processes. The possibility that such observation might indicate the involvement of peroxide/superoxide balance in fine tuning of TCR triggering, needs further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Nationally, {{there are}} {{questions}} regarding the design, fabrication, and erection of horizontally curved steel girder bridges due to unpredicted girder displacements, fit-up, and locked-in stresses. One reason for the concerns is that up to one-quarter of steel girder bridges are being designed with horizontal curvature. There is also an urgent need to reduce bridge maintenance costs by eliminating or reducing deck joints, which {{can be achieved by}} expanding the use of integral abutments to include curved girder bridges. However, the behavior of horizontally curved bridges with integral abutments during thermal loading is not well known nor understood. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the behavior of horizontal curved bridges with integral abutment (IAB) and semi-integral abutment bridges (SIAB) with a specific interest in the response to changing temperatures. The long-term objective of this effort is to establish guidelines for the use of integral abutments with curved girder bridges. The primary objective of this work was to monitor and evaluate the behavior of six in-service, horizontally curved, steel-girder bridges with integral and semi-integral abutments. In addition, the influence of bridge curvature, skew and pier bearing (expansion and fixed) were also part of the study. Two monitoring systems were designed and applied to a set of four horizontally curved bridges and two straight bridges at the northeast corner of Des Moines, Iowa—one system for measuring strains and movement under long term thermal changes and one system for measuring the behavior under short term, controlled live loading. A finite element model was developed and validated against the measured strains. The model was then used to investigate the sensitivity of design calculations to curvature, skew and pier joint conditions. The general conclusions were as follows: (1) There were no measurable differences in the behavior of the horizontally curved bridges and straight bridges studied in this work under thermal effects. For preliminary member sizing of curved bridges, thermal stresses and movements in a straight bridge of the same length are a reasonable first approximation. (2) Thermal strains in integral abutment and semi-integral abutment bridges were not noticeably different. The choice between IAB and SIAB should be based on life – cycle costs (e. g., construction and maintenance). (3) An <b>expansion</b> <b>bearing</b> pier reduces the thermal stresses in the girders of the straight bridge but does not appear to reduce the stresses in the girders of the curved bridge. (4) An analysis of the bridges predicted a substantial total stress (sum of the vertical bending stress, the lateral bending stress, and the axial stress) up to 3 ksi due to temperature effects. (5) For the one curved integral abutment bridge studied at length, the stresses in the girders significantly vary with changes in skew and curvature. With a 10 ⁰ skew and 0. 06 radians arc span length to radius ratio, the curved and skew integral abutment bridges can be designed as a straight bridge if an error in estimation of the stresses of 10 % is acceptable...|$|E

40|$|Chatter is a {{major problem}} causing poor surface finish, low {{material}} removal rate, machine tool failure, increased tool wear, excessive noise and thus increased cost for machining applications. Chatter vibrations can be avoided using stability diagrams for which tool point frequency response function (FRF) must be determined accurately. During cutting operations, due to gyroscopic moments, centrifugal forces and thermal <b>expansions</b> <b>bearing</b> dynamics change resulting in tool point FRF variations. In addition, gyroscopic moments on spindle-holder-tool assembly cause separation of modes in tool point FRF into backward and forward modes which will lead to variations in tool point FRF. Therefore, for accurate stability predictions of machining operations, effects of operational conditions on machine tool dynamics should be considered in calculations. In this study, spindle bearing dynamics are identified for various spindle rotational speeds and cutting forces. Then, for a real machining center, tool point FRFs under operating conditions are determined using the identified speed dependent bearing dynamics and the mathematical model proposed. Moreover, effects of gyroscopic moments and bearing dynamics variations on tool point FRF are examined separately. Finally, computationally determined tool point FRFs using revised bearing parameters are verified through chatter tests...|$|R

The Erskine Bridge {{played an important role in}} preserving year round links between the towns of Adelaide and Callington and its associated mines. The bridge is a utilitarian structure that remains largely in its original form, except for the replacement of timber decking by concrete. The bridge is typical of its type and demonstrates the simple use of stone piers and rivetted cast iron trusses. The bridge was named after Mr West-Erskine MP. The current bridge was opened in 1890 and comprises sandstone piers topped with iron trusses. The piers are ashlar faced with some tooling to quoins at the abutments. The road deck was originally timber, spanning across the two rivetted wrought iron trusses. The timber deck was replaced in 1943 with a concrete deck; further extensive repairs were carried out in 1979 to replace <b>expansion</b> <b>bearings,</b> flange plates and to provide corrosion protection to the bridge superstructure. The Erskine Bridge is relatively short and narrow and is supported by a central pier. The abutments and pier are rusticated and the former are battered against the river face.

This thesis is based on study of a three span curved post-tensioned concrete box-girder bridge with <b>expansion</b> <b>bearings.</b> It is part of a monitoring network and has been successfully monitored over a 6 year time period. Establishment of a baseline is essential for continuous monitoring of such a complicated bridge. Operationally, the baseline of structural health monitoring relates to the establishing of field testing database and finite element (FE) model which forms the basis for assessing the structural integrity. The establishment of the baseline field database to eliminate the effect of varying temperature conditions on the field testing data was first studied. This database used data collected from a full year cycle and was based on the undamaged status. Next, a new Mindlin plate element with an embedded through crack was developed for modeling cracking conditions on the bridge in FE analysis. The element behavior was investigated using numerical examples. Finally, the baseline FE model of the bridge was developed after updating to reflect the current condition. This involved the calibration of the material properties, utilization of spring bearing elements, and replacement of Mindlin plate elements (MP 4) on box-girder with cracked Mindlin plate elements (MP 4 C) to represent the bridge operating conditions. A good agreement in modal results has been observed between the baseline FE model and the baseline field database. Following this, the baseline FE model was used with an earthquake simulation based on introducing a selected ground motion to the bridge. It is shown that the field database and FE model established in this study can be reliably used as a baseline of the bridge monitoring system. The results demonstrate that a baseline study is necessary in order to assess the structural integrity for the bridge over time. ...|$|R

Several researches including real time field monitoring and finite element analyses have been conducted on straight and skewed integral abutment bridges in order to improve an understanding on field performance of them.
