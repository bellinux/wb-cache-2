40|$|ObjectiveThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of the objective radiologic analysis of high-resolution computed tomographic images of small peripheral non-small cell lung cancer and to select the candidates for curative limited resection. MethodsHigh-resolution computed tomographic images of 146 surgically resected T 1 N 0 M 0 peripheral non-small cell lung cancers were analyzed by using National Institutes of Health image software and classified on the basis of the percentage of ground-glass opacity within the tumor. ResultsEighty-seven percent of tumors <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> opacity ratios of 90 % to 100 % (type I) were diagnosed as noninvasive bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, whereas 55. 6 % of tumors <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> opacity ratios of 50 % to 89 % (type II) consisted of adenocarcinoma. Tumors <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> opacity ratios of 50 % or more (type I/II) had no nodal involvement, whereas nodal metastases were identified in 20. 0 % of tumors <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> opacity ratios of 10 % to 49 % (type III) and 24. 4 % of tumors <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> opacity ratios of less than 10 % (type IV). No tumors <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> opacity ratios of 50 % or more showed vessel infiltration, except for one lesion <b>with</b> a <b>ground-glass</b> opacity ratio of 50 %. The 3 -year disease-free survival was 97. 7 % for type I/II, 86. 1 % for type III, and 78. 5 % for type IV tumors. ConclusionsThe objective quantitative radiologic analysis with National Institutes of Health image software exhibited a good correlation with the histologic classification, pathologic invasiveness, and postoperative outcome of small peripheral lung cancer. Patients with tumors that have ground-glass opacity ratios of greater than 50 % are considered to be possible candidates for limited pulmonary resection...|$|R

Occasionally different entities mimic each other, either because they share identical HRCT findings or because of superimposition of patterns. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), fibrosis associated with connective tissue disease, asbestosis, end-stage sarcoidosis or chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) may present with lower zone, subpleural reticular pattern associated with honeycombing. Lymphangiomyomatosis may be indistinguishable from histiocytosis or extensive emphysema. Both pulmonary oedema and lymphangitic carcinomatosis may be characterised by septal pattern resulting from thickened interlobular septa. Ill-defined centrilobular nodular pattern may be identically present in HP and respiratory bronchiolitis–associated with interstitial lung disease (RBILD). Sarcoidosis may mimic miliary tuberculosis or haematogenous metastases presenting with miliary pattern, while endobronchial spread of tuberculosis may be indistinguishable from panbronchiolitis, both presenting with tree-in-bud pattern. Atypical infection presenting <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> mimics haemorrhage. <b>Ground-glass</b> pattern <b>with</b> minimal reticulation is seen in desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), RBILD and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). Obliterative bronchiolitis and panlobular emphysema may present with decreased attenuation pattern, while obliterative bronchiolitis, chronic pulmonary embolism and HP may manifest with mosaic attenuation pattern. Various mimics in interstitial lung diseases exist. Differential diagnosis is narrowed based on integration of predominant HRCT pattern and clinical history.|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} {{peculiar}} case of multifocal micronodular pneumocyte hyperplasia (MMPH) in a 54 -year-old woman with {{tuberous sclerosis complex}} (TSC) diagnosed during antituberculous treatment. Findings were initially detected by chest computed tomography (CT) to check for complication of pulmonary tuberculosis. Chest CT demonstrated multiple small nodules <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> opacity, measuring up to 5 mm diameter, presenting in the bilateral lung fields, without cystic change. Because the differentiation from multiple atypical adenomatous hyper-plasia (AAH) was necessary, we finally performed a diagnosis of MMPH based on specimens obtained by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Histologically, type II pneumocytes without nuclear atypia lined the thickened alveolar septa and proliferated papillary structures. There was no proliferation of immature smooth muscle cells suggestive of lymphangioleiomyomato-sis. Although immunohistochemical stains for cytokeratin and surfactant apoprotein A and B were positive for alveolar lining cells in each MMPH lesion, those for HMB- 45, alpha-smooth muscle actin, p 53 and carcinoembryonic antigen were negative. We must consider MMPH {{as part of the}} differential diagnosis along with multiple AAH when multiple small nodules <b>with</b> <b>ground-glass</b> opacity were observed on chest CT in patients with TSC.
