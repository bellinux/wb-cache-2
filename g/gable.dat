5|$|In 1962, Mrs. Jill Winkler Rath, {{widow of}} {{publicist}} Otto Winkler, filed a $100,000 {{lawsuit against the}} $2,000,000 estate of Clark <b>Gable</b> in connection with Winkler's death in the plane crash with Carole Lombard. The suit was dismissed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mrs. Rath, in her action, claimed <b>Gable</b> promised to provide financial aid for her if she would not bring suit against the airline involved.

5|$|The casting {{of the two}} lead roles {{became a}} complex, two-year endeavor. For the role of Rhett Butler, Selznick wanted Clark <b>Gable</b> from the start, but <b>Gable</b> was under {{contract}} to MGM, who never loaned him to other studios. Gary Cooper was considered, but Samuel Goldwyn—to whom Cooper was under contract—refused to loan him out. Warner offered a package of Bette Davis, Errol Flynn, and Olivia de Havilland for lead roles {{in return for the}} distribution rights. By this time, Selznick was determined to get <b>Gable</b> and eventually struck a deal with MGM. Selznick's father-in-law, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer, offered in August 1938 to provide <b>Gable</b> and $1,250,000 for half of the film's budget but for a high price: Selznick would have to pay Gable's weekly salary, and half the profits would go to MGM while Loew's, Inc—MGM's parent company—would release the film.|$|E

5|$|The north façade {{has three}} bays {{separated}} by windows and features a loggia, typical of early 17th-century houses, {{with a central}} arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch <b>gable,</b> which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at {{either side of the}} <b>gable.</b> Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on this side, building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern <b>gable</b> wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. The design is so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main <b>gable</b> of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main <b>gable,</b> flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E
