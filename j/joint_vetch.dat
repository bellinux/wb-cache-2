50|$|Aeschynomene {{americana}} is {{a species}} of flowering plant in the legume family known by many common names, including shyleaf, forage aeschynomene, American <b>joint</b> <b>vetch</b> (United States and Australia), thornless mimosa (Sri Lanka), bastard sensitive plant (Jamaica), pega pega, pega ropa, antejuela, ronte, cujicillo, and dormilonga (Latin America). It is native to Central America, parts of South America, the West Indies, and Florida.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Fabaceae species, {{including}} Stylosanthes biflora and Aeschynomene species. Adults {{feed on the}} nectar {{of various}} flowers including <b>joint</b> <b>vetches</b> and shepherd's needle, and are the principal pollinators of Cnidoscolus urens.|$|R

[...] In addition, the area contains the world’s largest population of Aeschynomene virginica, (sensitive <b>joint</b> <b>vetch).</b> Its NatureServ Conservation Status is G2, globally imperiled. The watershed also contains the state’s largest expanse of wild rice marsh, within the Glades Refuge, [...] and an old growth swamp forest, Bear Swamp, a NJ state listed Natural Heritage Priority Site.|$|E

Acacia angustissima) (white ball acacia) and Aeschynomene paniculata Willd. ex Vogel (pannicle <b>joint</b> <b>vetch),</b> were {{rejected}} for release after their identification as potential weeds in pasture evaluation trials. These plants are now targeted for control and, where possible, eradication from old experimental sites across Queensland. It is suspected that domestic livestock, feral and native animals {{contribute to the}} movement of these seeds through the ingestion and defecation of viable seeds across the landscape. This aspect was explored by feeding the intact seeds of these two species to sheep in metabolism cages. Sheep faeces were collected each day for 5 days after which time the faeces were sieved and the surviving intact seeds were then collected, counted and germination tests undertaken. The results show that seeds of both species pass through sheep with most seeds being passed after 48 h with a percentage of these seeds being viable. Of the number of seeds fed, 4. 25...|$|E
40|$|In a 1987 {{field study}} juveniles of Meloidogyne arenaria assayed {{at the time}} of peanut harvest were almost {{undetectable}} in plots planted with American jointvetch (Aeschynomene americana), castor bean (Ricinus communis), partridge pea (Cassia fasiculata), sesame (Sesamum indicum), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), whereas plots with peanut (Arachis hypogaea) averaged 120 juveniles/ 100 cm³ soil. Application of aldicarb in peanut resulted in an average of 27 juveniles/ 100 cm³ soil. In 1988 all plots were planted to peanut and the aldicarb treatment was repeated in plots that had the nematicide in 1987. In 1988 peanut yields from plots that had no peanut in 1987 were 51 - 69 % higher than the yield from those with continuous peanut and no nematicide. Aldicarb resulted in a 57 % increase in yield, which is comparable to 1 -year rotation to a nonhost crop. In 1988 harvest-time M. arenaria juvenile population densities in soil were the lowest in plots that had castor bean in 1987; however, the partridge pea-peanut and the sesame-peanut rotations also reduced numbers of juveniles when compared with continuous peanut with no nematicide. The aldicarb treatment resulted in juvenile population densities equivalent to those found with either the partridge pea or the sesame rotations. Rotations with American <b>joint</b> <b>vetch</b> or cotton did not result in lower juvenile population densities in peanut in 1988...|$|E
