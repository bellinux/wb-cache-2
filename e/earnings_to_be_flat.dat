40|$|Previous {{empirical}} research on informativeness of earnings {{has focused on}} stockholders, and has not examined earnings informativeness for stockholders and bondholders. Stockholders are residual claimants and bondholders are fixed claimants, the informativeness of earnings should differ for {{these two types of}} investors. When firm is financially strong, earnings changes should be of limited relevance to bondholders, but should <b>be</b> relevance <b>to</b> bondholders. In contrast, as the likelihood of financial distress increase, stockholder’s limited liability allows them to abandon the firm <b>to</b> bondholder and <b>earnings</b> change should <b>be</b> increasingly important <b>to</b> bondholders and less important <b>to</b> shareholders because <b>earnings</b> provide information on firm value. This suggest that the effect of <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock return should decrease as the firm’s financial strength declines, while the effect of <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> bond return should increase. In contrast, when firm’s financial condition is strong, the effect of <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock return <b>is</b> higher than the effect of <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> bond return. We refer to this as the liquidation option hypothesis. The objective of this study <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine liquidation option hypothesis. We use bond rating as financial condition’s measurement. Consistent with our hypotheses, we find that the effect of unexpected <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock return <b>is</b> significant when firm is financially strong but the effect of unexpected <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> bond return <b>is</b> not significant. When financial distress increase, the effect of unexpected <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> stock return <b>is</b> not significant but the effect of unexpected <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> bond return <b>is</b> significan...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{investigates the}} effects of {{preferences}} on judgments in an investing context, where investors should <b>be</b> motivated <b>to</b> interpret information objectively, yet have clear preferences with respect to what the information they are evaluating conveys (i. e., a gain or a loss on their investment). The results of the experiment are consistent with theories of motivated reasoning that predict when and in what manner directional preferences affect how information is processed. Specifically, investors <b>are</b> motivated <b>to</b> agree unthinkingly with information that suggests they might make money on their investment, but disagree with information that suggests they might lose money. In disagreeing, long investors expect <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relatively high and short investors expect <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> relatively low. These results have implications not only for understanding investor behavior, but also for understanding the biased behavior of market participants who face conflicts of interest, such as analysts, managers, and auditors, by providing direct evidence that such behavior can arise for purely psychological reasons.

40|$|While {{there is}} ample {{evidence}} that income inequalities influence individuals' health status, the mechanisms behind this income inequality-health correlation are only partially understood. This study shows that inequalities evaluated on the basis of individual perceptions of injustice are a driving force behind this connection. Two main questions are addressed: Does perceiving one's earnings as unfair affect physical health? Do such perceptions contribute to structural health inequalities? The hypotheses presented are based on the effort-reward imbalance model, according to which experiencing injustice causes stress, which can {{have a negative effect on}} individual health. Analyses of large-scale longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel of the years 2005 - 2010 show that female employees who perceive their earnings as unjustly low display significantly worse physical health, and that if employees perceive their <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unjust for an extended period, this contributes to the deterioration of individual physical health in male and female employees. Employees from lower social classes, in particular unskilled blue-collar workers, more frequently perceive their <b>earnings</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unjust. Experience of unjust earnings mediates the relationship between social class and physical health, if to a limited extent. Our conclusion is that differential exposure <b>to</b> unjust <b>earnings</b> contributes <b>to</b> the emergence of structural health inequalities...|$|R
