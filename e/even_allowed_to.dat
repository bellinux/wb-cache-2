5|$|In 1958, Khrushchev {{opened a}} Central Committee meeting to {{hundreds}} of Soviet officials; some were <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> address the meeting. For the first time, {{the proceedings of the}} Committee were made public in book form, a practice which was continued at subsequent meetings. This openness, however, actually allowed Khrushchev greater control over the Committee, since any dissenters would have to make their case in front of a large, disapproving crowd.|$|E
5|$|Later in the Han Dynasty, mystics like Luan {{gradually}} {{lost their}} influence as the rulers passed many laws against them. Mediums {{were not allowed}} to barter their crafts alongside roads, and some were even forbidden to make a living at such a craft at all. Those married to shamans were not <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> hold government office, though this law was often bypassed. Luan Da's fall signaled {{the beginning of the end}} for these mystics.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{exceptions}} were made; Israel and Egypt {{could buy}} advanced designs under the Camp David Agreements, Israel was <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> buy McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagles, {{a key component}} in U.S. air-defense technology. Iran was already receiving the Grumman F-14 Tomcat, and this demonstrated the problem with advanced exports in February 1979 when reports emerged that Iran had sold an AIM-54 Phoenix missile to the Soviets. South Korea's F-16 order was initially blocked under this policy, but later allowed {{in the context of}} strengthening relations. Despite exceptions, the export policy was implemented, covering many potential and current customers. As the F-5G was a relatively modest upgrade to the F-5E, the F-5G appeared to be in a strong position for sales given the limitations placed on rival designs, however Carter personally blocked the sales of the F-5G to Taiwan.|$|E

5|$|The {{first signs}} of a {{rehabilitation}} were seen during Leonid Brezhnev's rule, when information about him was again allowed {{to be included in}} Soviet encyclopaedias. His connection, support and work in the Anti-Party Group was mentioned in encyclopaedias published in 1973 and 1974, but eventually disappeared altogether by the mid-to-late-1970s. Soviet leader Konstantin Chernenko further rehabilitated Molotov; in 1984 Molotov was <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> seek membership in the Communist Party. A collection of interviews with Molotov from 1985 was published in 1994 by Felix Chuev as Molotov Remembers: Inside Kremlin Politics. In June 1986, Molotov was hospitalized in Kuntsevo hospital in Moscow and he died, during the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev, on 8 November 1986. During his long life Molotov suffered seven myocardial infarctions, but lived to 96 years and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow.|$|E
5|$|Wu {{heard that}} at Michigan {{women were not}} <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> use the front entrance, and decided that she would prefer to study at Berkeley. Yuan took her to see Raymond T. Birge, {{the head of the}} physics department, and he offered Wu a place in the {{graduate}} school {{despite the fact that the}} academic year had already commenced. Wu then abandoned her plans to study at Michigan and enrolled at Berkeley. Her Berkeley classmates included Robert R. Wilson and George Volkoff; her friends included Ursula Schaefer, a history student who chose to remain in the United States rather than return to Nazi Germany, and Margaret Lewis, an American post-doctoral student. Wu applied for a scholarship at the end of her first year, but there was prejudice against Asian students, and Wu and Yuan were instead offered a readership with a lower stipend. Yuan then applied for, and secured, a scholarship at Caltech.|$|E

25|$|During the Austro-Hungarian rule in Transylvania, {{although}} Romanians {{formed the}} majority of the population, many Romanians were treated as second-class citizens (or even non-citizens) In some Transylvanian cities like Brașov (at that time the Transylvanian Saxon citadel of Kronstadt), Romanians were not <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> reside within the city walls.|$|E

25|$|The Chasseurs Britanniques were {{originally}} formed from French Royalist emigres in 1801, and served throughout the wars. The unit served chiefly in the Mediterranean until 1811, when it {{participated in the}} later stages of the Peninsular War. It had a good record in battle but later became notorious for desertion, and was not <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> perform outpost duty, for fears that the pickets would abscond.|$|E
25|$|In July 1946, Laue {{went back}} to England, only four months after having been interned there, to attend an {{international}} conference on crystallography.

25|$|Even as the Arab {{governors}} {{adopted the}} more sophisticated Iranian methods of governmental administration, non-Arabs were still prevented from holding such positions. Non-Arabs were not <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> wear Arabian style clothing, so strong were the feelings of Arab racial superiority cultivated by the Umayyads. Much of the discontent this caused led to the Shu'ubiyya movement, an assertion of non-Arab racial and cultural equality with Arabs. The movement gained support among Egyptians, Arameans and Berber people, though this movement was most pronounced among Iranian people.|$|E

After a rocky start, Cho gained momentum, beating three top players, until he lost to Rin Kaiho, who was Meijin at the time, in the 9th Asahi Pro Best Ten tournament.|$|E
25|$|After Dorgon's {{death on}} 31 December 1650, the Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1643 – 1661) started to rule {{personally}} and announced {{his intention to}} purge corruption from officialdom. He dismissed Feng Quan from his post of grand secretary and replaced him with Chen Mingxia, who by then had become President of the Ministry of Personnel. Though later in 1651 Chen was also dismissed on charges of influence peddling, he was reinstated in his post in 1653 and soon became a close personal advisor to the sovereign. He was <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> draft imperial edicts just as Ming grand secretaries used to. While in his high position at court, Chen was among the many officials who tried to sway famous southern scholar Wu Weiye (1609–1671) into serving the Qing, which Wu accepted to do in 1653.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} rabbinical literature, it {{was argued}} that the Biblical regulations concerning left-overs only applied to corn fields, orchards, and vineyards, and not to vegetable gardens; the classical rabbinical writers were much stricter in regard to who could receive the remains. It was stated that the farmer was not permitted {{to benefit from the}} gleanings, and was not permitted to discriminate among the poor, nor try to frighten them away with dogs or lions (Hullin 131a, Pe'ah 5:6) the farmer was not <b>even</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> help one of the poor to gather the left-overs. However, it was also {{argued that the}} law was only applicable in Canaan, (Jerusalem Talmud. Pe'ah 2:5) although many classical rabbinical writers who were based in Babylon observed the laws there (Hullin 134b) it was also seen as only applying to Jewish paupers, but poor non-Jews were allowed to benefit for the sake of civil peace (Gittin 59b).|$|E
40|$|Often, {{fixed-line}} incumbents also own {{the largest}} mobile network. We consider {{the effect of}} this joint ownership on market outcomes. Our model predicts that while fixed-to-mobile call prices to the integrated mobile network are more efficient than under separation, those to rival mobile networks are distorted upwards, amplifying any incumbency advantage. As concerns potential remedies, a uniform off-net pricing constraint leads to higher welfare than functional separation and <b>even</b> <b>allows</b> <b>to</b> maintain some of the efficiency gains...|$|R
30|$|The broad {{acceptance}} of models based on stochastic geometry has diverted {{attention away from}} the still ongoing improvement of deterministic structures, with their most famous representative being the hexagonal grid model. They <b>allow</b> <b>to</b> reflect the impact of the network planning, which might increasingly disappear with the emergence of self-organizing networks (SON) [123 – 125], and also account for more fundamental limitations such as topological and geographical constraints. In this section, we review efforts to facilitate the interference analysis using these structures, <b>even</b> <b>allowing</b> <b>to</b> represent multi-tier heterogeneous topologies.|$|R
