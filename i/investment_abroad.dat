2500|$|Netanyahu {{has been}} {{described}} as 'the advocate of the free-market'. As Prime Minister in his first term, he significantly reformed the banking sector, removing barriers to <b>investment</b> <b>abroad,</b> mandatory purchases of government securities and direct credit. [...] As Minister of Finance (2003–2005), Netanyahu introduced a major overhaul of the Israeli economy. He introduced a welfare to work program, he led a program of privatization, reduced the size of the public sector, reformed and streamlined the taxation system and passed laws against monopolies and cartels with the aim of increasing competition. Netanyahu extended capital gains taxes from companies to individuals, which allowed him to enlarge the tax base while reducing taxes on incomes. As the Israeli economy started booming and unemployment fell significantly, Netanyahu was widely credited by commentators as having performed an 'economic miracle' {{by the end of his}} tenure. Direct investment in the Israeli economy had increased by an annualized 380%. On the other hand, his critics have labelled his economic views as Margaret Thatcher-inspired [...] "popular capitalism".|$|E

60|$|I {{shall be}} asked, What {{about all this}} foreign {{investment}} that is going on? Is not British credit now being diverted abroad to foreign countries, {{to the detriment of}} our own country? Is not British capital fleeing from The Socialistic speeches of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the President of the Board of Trade, and taking refuge in Germany, where of course there are no Socialists, or in other countries, where there is never any disturbance, like France, or Spain, or Russia, or Turkey? Now let us look into that. There are only two ways in which capital can leave this country for foreign investments. It is no good sending bits of paper to the foreigner and expecting him to pay a dividend in return. There are only two ways--one is by exports made by British labour, and the other by bullion. Now, if the exports were to increase, surely that should be a cause of rejoicing, especially to our Tariff Reformers, who regard the increase in exports as the index of national prosperity. As for the second--the export of bullion--would you believe it, it is only a coincidence, but it is an amusing coincidence, there are actually six million pounds' worth more gold in the country now, than there were {{at the beginning of the}} year before the Budget was introduced. The active and profitable <b>investment</b> <b>abroad</b> which has marked the last two or three years, which is bound to swell the exports of the next few years, has not been attended by any starvation of home industry. On the contrary, the amount of money forthcoming for the development of new industries and now enterprises in this country during the last two or three years has compared very favourably with the years which immediately preceded them, when the Conservative Government was in power.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The {{level of}} Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into Japan {{has always been}} {{considered}} low compared to other leading developed countries. Both the ratio of inward FDI to GDP and the ratio of foreign investments into Japan to Japanese <b>investments</b> <b>abroad</b> have remained far smaller than the average for the latter countries. In 1999, inward FDI amounted to 0. 7 % of the GDP whereas the ratio reached 9. 3 %, 9. 5 %, 11. 7 % and 23. 3 % for Germany, the United States, France and England, respectively. Inward foreign investments amounted to 13 % of Japanese <b>investments</b> <b>abroad</b> while the ratio was 54 %, 96 %, 61 % and 59 % for the four developed countries, respectively. Furthermore, in 1999, Japanese <b>investments</b> <b>abroad</b> accounted for 6. 2 % of the world stock of outward investments; in contrast, FDI in Japan stayed at 0. 8 % of the world stock of inward investments. 1) The observed fact has commonly been attributed to the higher cost of production, and {{the social and economic}} structure including more r...|$|R
