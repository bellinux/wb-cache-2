By the Parma–Greece town line, where NY104 intersects the southern terminus of NY261, Ridge Road is lined with commercial properties of varying size. Continuing east, NY104 meets the northern terminus of NY386. Here, NY 104 widens to a six-lane divided highway. Between NY386 and NY390 exit24, NY104 passes by several large shopping malls, the largest of which is The Mall at Greece Ridge {{at the intersection of}} NY104 and Long Pond Road. At NY390, NY104 continues to be a six-lane divided highway as it heads toward Rochester. It enters the city limits upon meeting Mount Read Boulevard at an interchange.|$|E
5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is {{dominated}} by electron scattering, which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> the cube of the star's mass. For stars below 10 , the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass. For very low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere {{also contribute to the}} opacity. Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of the research were to investigate the behavior of dairy farmers and factors affecting the effort to enhance the economic of scale. Survey was conducted on 75 dairy farmers at Getasan District, Semarang Regency. Samples were drawn in random from villages of Jetak, Batur and Tajur, 25 farmers each. The data were analyzed by logit model regression, using 15 indicators of behavioural approach and socio-economic factors as predictors (independent variables) i. e. ages, formal education, family size, experience in cattle rearing, number of cattle raised, production of milk and land occupation. The result showed that 40. 04 % of the farmers were good, 33. 07 % were moderate and 20. 89 % were low risk takers. The farmers’ behaviour in enhancing economic of scale significantly influenced by the farmers’ age, milk production and number of cattle reared. The odds ratio of ages, milk production and number of cattle reared were 0. 93; 1. 32 and 1. 37, respectively. These values indicated that as values of ages <b>increased</b> <b>as</b> much as 1 year, {{the values of the}} willingness on risk taking will decrease as much as 0. 93 times; the values of milk production <b>increase</b> <b>as</b> much as 1 litre, the values of the willingness on risk taking will <b>increase</b> <b>as</b> much as 1. 32 times; and the values of the number of cattle <b>increased</b> <b>as</b> much as 1 AU, the values of the willingness on risk taking will <b>increase</b> <b>as</b> much as 1. 37 times...|$|R

5|$|Increasingly, {{ski resorts}} are relying on snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on ski slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at ski resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their ski seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
5|$|Meanders are sinuous bends in rivers {{or other}} channels, which form as a fluid, most often water, flows around bends. As {{soon as the}} path is {{slightly}} curved, the size and curvature of each loop <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> helical flow drags material like sand and gravel across the river {{to the inside of}} the bend. The outside of the loop is left clean and unprotected, so erosion accelerates, further increasing the meandering in a powerful positive feedback loop.|$|E
5|$|Migrating birds rely {{largely on}} stored fat {{and they also}} metabolise protein as a {{supplementary}} source of energy. Those with a relatively large amount of fat, may make stops during migration of only 1–2 days; although they have lost weight since commencing their journey, they have enough energy reserves to reach the wintering areas. The proportion of migrating males <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> they travel south through Europe. There is competition within the species even during migration, and the larger and more aggressive males may get more food. Their death rate is therefore {{lower than that of}} the females both on the southward migration, and in resident populations.|$|E

In general, Np hydroxides at various oxidation levels are less stable than the actinides before it on the periodic table such as thorium and uranium and more stable than those after it such as plutonium and americium. This phenomenon is because the stability of an ion <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> the ratio of atomic number to the radius of the ion increases. Thus actinides higher on the periodic table will more readily undergo hydrolysis.|$|E

The coat of males shows two-tone colouration: while the upper parts and outsides of the legs are dark brown to black, the underparts and the insides of the legs are all white. Darkness typically <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> the male ages. On the other hand, females and juveniles are yellowish fawn to tan. In Texas, blackbuck moult in spring, following which the males look notably lighter, though darkness persists on the face and the legs. On the contrary, males will grow darker as the breeding season approaches. Both melanism and albinism have been observed in wild blackbuck. Albino blackbuck are often zoo attractions as in the Indira Gandhi Zoological Park (Andhra Pradesh, India).|$|E
5|$|A bike is also {{an example}} of an {{inverted}} pendulum. Just as a broomstick is more easily balanced in the hand than a pencil, a tall bike (with a high center of mass) can be easier to balance when ridden than a low one because the tall bike's lean rate (rate at which its angle of lean <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> it begins to fall over) will be slower. However, a rider can have the opposite impression of a bike when it is stationary. A top-heavy bike can require more effort to keep upright, when stopped in traffic for example, than a bike which is just as tall but with a lower center of mass. This {{is an example of a}} vertical second-class lever. A small force at the end of the lever, the seat or handlebars at the top of the bike, more easily moves a large mass if the mass is closer to the fulcrum, where the tires touch the ground. This is why touring cyclists are advised to carry loads low on a bike, and panniers hang down on either side of front and rear racks.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and Phase II. MWAA has justified these toll <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020.

5|$|Economists became {{interested}} in hysteresis when unemployment levels spiked with the 1979 oil shock and early 1980s recessions but {{did not return to}} the lower levels that had been considered the natural rate. Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers (1986) explained hysteresis in unemployment with insider-outsider models, which were also proposed by of Assar Lindbeck and Dennis Snower in a series of papers and then a book. Insiders, employees already working at a firm, are only concerned about their own welfare. They would rather keep their wages high than cut pay and expand employment. The unemployed, outsiders, do not have any voice in the wage bargaining process, so their interests are not represented. When unemployment increases, the number of outsiders <b>increases</b> <b>as</b> well. Even after the economy has recovered, outsiders continue to be disenfranchised from the bargaining process. The larger pool of outsiders created by periods of economic retraction can lead to persistently higher levels of unemployment. The presence of hysteresis in the labor market also raises the importance of monetary and fiscal policy. If temporary downturns in the economy can create long term increases in unemployment, stabilization policies do more than provide temporary relief; they prevent short term shocks from becoming long term increases in unemployment.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy <b>increases.</b> <b>As</b> thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
