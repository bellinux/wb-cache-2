5|$|Some United States Army Air Forces {{aircraft}} used {{a variation}} of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the top side of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged in olive drab above and neutral gray below, though some had the edges of flying surfaces painted <b>in</b> <b>medium</b> green. In the later stages of the war camouflage was often dispensed with, both to save time in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish.|$|E
5|$|The B.1 {{had four}} {{elevators}} (inboard) and four ailerons (outboard). In the B.2, these {{were replaced by}} eight elevons. The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (<b>in,</b> <b>medium</b> drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style of rank {{insignia}} for the officers.

They were made of wool, and these uniforms were not fit for {{the heat of the}} lower decks of a ship. Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.|$|E

5|$|At the time, most British {{television}} drama {{was shot}} {{on a combination}} of film and videotape. Usually location shooting would be on film and studio work would be recorded on video. The effect of the change <b>in</b> <b>medium</b> from film to video (or vice versa) during a scene change in a programme could be jarring for some viewers. Boucher structured his scripts carefully so that all the Earth-based scenes would be shot on film on location and all the space scenes would be recorded on video in the studio hoping that the effect would give the space scenes a unique look. He was disappointed, therefore, to discover that Gridneff had decided to record the entire series on videotape.|$|E
5|$|Being {{designed}} for low-level operations, the Tornado required modification to perform <b>in</b> <b>medium</b> level operations that the RAF {{adopted in the}} 1990s. The RAF's GR1 fleet was extensively re-manufactured as Tornado GR4s. Upgrades on Tornado GR4s included a Forward looking infrared, a wide-angle HUD (Head-up display), improved cockpit displays, NVG (Night vision devices) capabilities, new avionics, and a Global Positioning System receiver. The upgrade eased the integration of new weapons and sensors which were purchased in parallel, including the Storm Shadow cruise missile, the Brimstone anti-tank missile, Paveway III laser-guided bombs and the RAPTOR reconnaissance pod was integrated. The first flight of a Tornado GR4 was on 4 April 1997, on 31 October 1997 the RAF accepted the first delivery and deliveries were completed in 2003. In 2005, the RSAF opted to have their Tornado IDSs undergo a series of upgrades to become equivalent to the RAF's GR4 configuration. On 21 December 2007 BAE signed a £210m contract for CUSP, the Capability Upgrade Strategy (Pilot). This project would see RAF GR4/4A improved in two phases, starting with {{the integration of the}} Paveway IV bomb and a communications upgrade, followed by a new tactical datalink in Phase B.|$|E
5|$|The analog {{technique}} {{is a complex}} way of making a forecast, requiring the forecaster to remember a previous weather event {{that is expected to}} be mimicked by an upcoming event. What makes it a difficult technique to use is that there is rarely a perfect analog for an event in the future. Some call this type of forecasting pattern recognition. It remains a useful method of observing rainfall over data voids such as oceans, as well as the forecasting of precipitation amounts and distribution in the future. A similar {{technique is}} used <b>in</b> <b>medium</b> range forecasting, which is known as teleconnections, when systems in other locations are used to help pin down the location of another system within the surrounding regime. An example of teleconnections are by using El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) related phenomena.|$|E
40|$|Freshly-isolated rat hepatocytes {{were exposed}} in glucose (15 mM) or {{fructose}} (5 mM) medium to menadione (2 -methyl- 1, 4 -naphthoquinone) (85 microM) or 1, 4 -naphthoquinone (NQ) (50 microM). Menadione and NQ {{are closely related}} quinones and have an approximately equal potential to induce redox cycling. However, NQ has a higher potential to arylate and is more toxic than menadione. During 2 hr of incubation, cell viability, thiol status, adenine nucleotide level and lactate production were determined. LDH-leakage {{was used as a}} measure of cell viability. <b>In</b> glucose <b>medium,</b> exposure of hepatocytes to menadione or NQ resulted in a faster excretion rate of oxidized glutathione as compared to those cells <b>in</b> fructose <b>medium.</b> As a result, quinone-exposed hepatocytes <b>in</b> fructose <b>medium</b> retained higher amounts of oxidized glutathione. Menadione-exposed hepatocytes <b>in</b> fructose <b>medium</b> exhibited a diminished rate of transthiolation of protein thiols with oxidized glutathione as compared to those cells <b>in</b> glucose <b>medium.</b> The adenine nucleotide level of hepatocytes <b>in</b> glucose <b>medium</b> was markedly higher than <b>in</b> fructose <b>medium.</b> This was caused by an ATP decrease in hepatocytes <b>in</b> fructose <b>medium</b> resulting <b>in</b> a low energy charge (E.

Despite the higher oxidized glutathione content and the lower ATP level of NQ-exposed hepatocytes <b>in</b> fructose <b>medium,</b> they had a better viability than those cells <b>in</b> glucose <b>medium.</b> From our results we conclude that a high ATP content is not always beneficial for cell surviva...|$|R

40|$|Using the {{standard}} strains such as Sh. flexneri 2 a, St. aureus and St. albus that are stocked in our laboratory, the author studied the glucolysis of these {{bacteria in the}} course of culture <b>in</b> the <b>medium</b> containing KCN or NaN(3) and also compared the enzymatic behaviors of each kind of bacteria in resting state while being cultured <b>in</b> the <b>medium</b> loaded with KCN or NaN(3). The results are as follows: 1.
