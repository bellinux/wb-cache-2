40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{critical}} reflection {{on the use of}} monetary <b>incentives</b> in economic experiments. The argument is that <b>incentives</b> have their effect through their influence on one or more of three factors: (1) cognitive exertion; (2) motivational focus; (3) emotional triggers. I suggest that these effects can often be achieved without monetary <b>incentives,</b> and <b>incentives</b> are not even guaranteed to achieve those effects. There are also disadvantages to requiring the use of <b>incentives</b> in experiments. The paper concludes by suggesting there is no basis for requiring the use of real <b>incentives</b> to do experimental economics. experimental methods, <b>incentives,...</b>|$|R

The sample used in this study to recover 61 employees who are at the vulnerable age of productive and non-productive. The question is given by using a questionnaire distributed through random sampling techniques and analytical method used is a validity test, reliability test, the classical assumption, multiple regression and analysis path. In accordance with the above objectives in this study was formulated five hypotheses, including financial <b>incentives</b> positive effect on work motivation, non-financial <b>incentives</b> significant effect on work motivation, financial <b>incentives</b> significant effect on work performance, financial <b>incentives</b> significant effect on job performance, non-financial <b>incentives</b> significant effect on job performance and work motivation significant effect on job performance.
