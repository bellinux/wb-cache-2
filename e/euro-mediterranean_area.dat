40|$|Vegetation {{monitoring}} and mapping based on multi-temporal imagery has recently received much attention {{due to the}} plethora of medium-high spatial resolution satellites and the improved classification accuracies attained compared to uni-temporal approaches. Efficient image processing strategies are needed to exploit the phenological information present in temporal image sequences and to limit data redundancy and computational complexity. Within this framework, we implement the theory of Hidden Markov Models in crop classification, based on the time-series analysis of phenological states, inferred by a sequence of remote sensing observations. More specifically, we model the dynamics of vegetation over an agricultural area of Greece, characterized by spatio-temporal heterogeneity and small-sized fields, using RapidEye and Landsat ETM+ imagery. In addition, the classification performance of image sequences with variable spatial and temporal characteristics is evaluated and compared. The classification model considering one RapidEye and four pan-sharpened Landsat ETM+ images was found superior, resulting in a conditional kappa from 0. 77 to 0. 94 per class and an overall accuracy of 89. 7 %. The results highlight {{the potential of the}} method for operational crop mapping in <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>areas</b> and provide some hints for optimal image acquisition windows regarding major crop types in Greece...|$|R

Objectives: We evaluated {{the effect of}} Saharan dust on the association between different PM fractions and daily mortality in Rome, Italy. Met h o d s: In a study of 80, 423 adult residents who died in Rome between 2001 and 2004, we performed a time-series analysis to explore the effects of PM 2. 5, PM 2. 5 – 10, and PM 10 on natural, cardiac, cerebrovascular, and respiratory mortality. We defined Saharan dust days by combining {{light detection and ranging}} (LIDAR) observations and analyses from operational models. We tested a Saharan dust–PM interaction term to evaluate the hypothesis that the effects of PM, especially coarse PM (PM 2. 5 – 10), on mortality would be enhanced on dust days.

40|$|Introduction]. The <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> Free Trade <b>Area</b> envisaged by the Barcellona Declaration of November 1995 {{should be}} {{accomplished}} by 2010, and is currently being organized through the new Euro-Mediterranean Association Agreements with partner countries.

Thus, {{it can be said}} that sufficient materials exist to give an accurate evaluation about the construction of the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> Free Trade <b>Area</b> (FTA). The paper argues that although the FTA has been conceived without fully considering all of its consequences, and actually restricting free trade only to some products, it can encourage growth on both the shores of the Mediterranean, provided that the EU adequately participate to the funding of structural change in the South, and that partner countries agree to improve domestic policies and to integrate their economies reciprocally.

40|$|In the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>area,</b> {{including}} the Marmara Sea and the Black Sea, {{there is a}} potential for the occurrence of large tsunamis, as is testified by historical data and is supported by the today’s knowledge of the seismotectonic setting of the area. The major sources of the Mediterranean tsunamis are submarine and coastal earthquakes, but also landslides and volcanic activity may generate tsunamis (see Tinti et al., 2001), and further there are recognized instances of tsunami-like perturbations excited by travelling air pressure pulses that are known as meteotsunamis (Montserrat et al., 2006). The main scope of the paper is to present the state-of- the-art of today’s research in tsunamis in the Euro-Mediterranean region, and to delineate future perspectives both in terms of knowledge improvement {{and in terms of the}} implementation of measures to mitigate the tsunami effects and to protect the coastal communities. It is noted that after the big tsunami disaster in the Indian Ocean in 2004, populations and governments in the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>area</b> have suddenly realized that the region resulted unprotected from tsunamis since no Tsunami Warning System (TWS) was in place at that time.

40|$|Abstract In the {{alarming}} context of risk of Zika virus (ZIKV) transmission in the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>area,</b> {{there is a}} need to examine whether capacities to detect, diagnose and notify ZIKV infections in the region are in place and whether ongoing capacity-building initiatives are filling existing gaps. The MediLabSecure network, created in 2014, comprises 55 laboratories of virology and medical entomology and 19 public health institutions in 19 countries in the Balkans, North-Africa, the Middle-East and the Black Sea regions. It aims to set up awareness, risk assessment, monitoring and control of emerging and re-emerging vector-borne viruses. We here examine the actions and strategies that MediLabSecure has been implementing and how they will contribute to the prevention and control of the ZIKV threat in the <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>area.</b> Capacity-building for arbovirus diagnostics is a major objective of the project and follows a methodological rather than disease-driven approach. This enables the implementation of laboratory trainings on techniques that are common to several arboviruses, including ZIKV, and putting into action appropriate diagnostic tools in the target region. Moreover, by its One Health approach and the interaction of its four sub-networks in human virology, animal virology, medical entomology and public health, MediLabSecure is fostering intersectoral collaboration, expertise and sharing of information. The resulting exchanges (methodological, communication and operational) across disciplines and across countries, dedicated research on intersectoral collaboration and increasing diagnostic capacities are providing new paths and tools to public health professionals to face emerging viral threats such as a ZIKV epidemic in the Euro-Mediterranean region...|$|E

40|$|Mycological plant {{pathology}},a {{branch of}} plant pathology (phytopathology) studies plant diseases caused by fungi and fungi-like organisms. Although humanity has {{been concerned with}} plant diseases since pre-history, phytopathology has first developed into a scientific discipline only during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. The European and <b>Euro-Mediterranean</b> <b>areas,</b> and the other southern and Eastern areas of the Mediterranean Basin which are dealt with in this chapter, are characterized by large climatic diversity and diverse plant populations, either cultivated or wild. Therefore {{a large number of}} fungi may cause numerous plant diseases, which can be widespread or limited in their distribution, and result in more or less severe impact on yield or quality of produce and possibly on the ecosystems. Diagnosis of disease, identification of the pathogen to the level of species or below (race or pathotype) and knowledge of pathogen biology and disease epidemiology are prerequisites for efficient disease management. Disease control options include exclusion of the host from an area (quarantine measures, certification schemes for seed and multiplication plant material), appropriate selection of cultural practices (crop rotation, fertilization, tillage, irrigation systems etc.), use of resistant host cultivars, and the recourse to chemical (fungicides), physical (e. g. soil solarization) and biological control agents. Several organizations, national and international, operate in the European and Mediterranean area in the fields of research, extension, legislation formation and enforcement. New challenges, related to rapid trade intensification and globalization, demographic and socio- economic variations, as well as climate change, are facing the plant protection organization at large.
