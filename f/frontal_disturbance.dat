50|$|A broad trough {{developed}} over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on May 26. A <b>frontal</b> <b>disturbance</b> formed over Florida along the trough, spawning an area of broad cyclonic turning. After emerging into the western Atlantic Ocean, a closed circulation developed within the system, and {{it is estimated that}} a tropical depression formed on May 28 about 100 mi (160 km) east of Jacksonville, Florida. Ship observations in the region suggested that the depression intensified into a tropical storm by late on May 28. The system was small, and was not discovered to have been a tropical cyclone until a reanalysis of data in 2015. The storm moved to the northeast ahead of an approaching trough, bypassing the Carolinas to the east; rainfall brushed the coast of North Carolina. On May 29, ship observations suggested peak winds of 50 mph (85 km/h). On the next day, the storm became associated with a warm front, indicating that it became extratropical to the southeast of New England. Continuing to the northeast, the former storm crossed over the southeastern coast of Newfoundland before being absorbed by another nontropical low to the northwest on May 31.|$|E
40|$|Sea surface {{temperature}} (SST) has been {{measured in the}} south of Japan using a thermometer set up in the ferry boat to investigate the characteristics of the warm water intrudes into the coastal areas from the Kuroshio. Time series analysis was applied to the SST data with satellite images and hydrographic observation data from April 1987 to September 1989. The results indicate that the warm Kuroshio water intruded into the coastal areas on the Enshu-nada and the Kumano-nada Seas intermittently with periods of about 50 and 20 days associated with the fluctuation of the Kuroshio path and the Kuroshio <b>frontal</b> <b>disturbance</b> respectively. The intrusion with a 50 -day period was dominant when the Kuroshio took a stationary small meander path (B- and C-types). The warm water spread to the west at 20 cm s– 1, and was estimated to have a depth of 150 m at least and supply enough heat to make up the loss due to the evaporation in the coastal area. During the straight path of the Kuroshio, it was detected that the warm water intruded into coastal areas only with a 20 -day period. The warm water that intrudes with a period of 20 days spreads to the west at 25 cm s– 1 in a small scale. 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{high-resolution}} {{satellite image}} that reveals a train of coherent, submesoscale (6 km) vortices {{along the edge}} of an ocean front is examined in concert with hydrographic measurements in an effort to understand formation mechanisms of the submesoscale eddies. The infrared satellite image consists of ocean surface temperatures at inline image m resolution over the midlatitude North Atlantic (48. 69 °N, 16. 19 °W). Concomitant altimetric observations coupled with regular spacing of the eddies suggest the eddies result from mesoscale stirring, filamentation, and subsequent frontal instability. While horizontal shear or barotropic instability (BTI) is one mechanism for generating such eddies (Munk's hypothesis), we conclude from linear theory coupled with the in situ data that mixed layer or submesoscale baroclinic instability (BCI) is a more plausible explanation for the observed submesoscale vortices. Here we assume that the <b>frontal</b> <b>disturbance</b> remains in its linear growth stage and is accurately described by linear dynamics. This result likely has greater applicability to the open ocean, i. e., regions where the gradient Rossby number is reduced relative to its value along coasts and within strong current systems. Given that such waters comprise an appreciable percentage of the ocean surface and that energy and buoyancy fluxes differ under BTI and BCI, this result has wider implications for open-ocean energy/buoyancy budgets and parameterizations within ocean general circulation models. In summary, this work provides rare observational evidence of submesoscale eddy generation by BCI in the open ocean...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{conventional}} surface observations and NASA Quick Scatterometer (QuikSCAT) data, a heavy rainfall event {{that occurred in}} the Taiwan mei-yu season was chosen to further study the kinematic characteristics of the accompanying surface front. With the help of the QuikSCAT oceanic surface winds, {{it was found that the}} location and propagation of a mei-yu front over the ocean to the east of Taiwan during 10 – 12 June 2000 are better represented by the frontal wind shift line, which was located approximately on the leading edge of the baroclinic zone. The mesoscale system with cyclonic circulation embedded within the frontal zone was clearly shown in the wind field and kinematic parameters (horizontal divergence and vorticity) as well as satellite clouds and rainfall estimations. The conditional instability of the second kind (CISK) process was suggested to be responsible for the intensification of the mei-yu front and the <b>frontal</b> <b>disturbance</b> over the ocean. Under the influence of island topography over Taiwan and the mountains over southern China, the frontal wind shift line distorted and receded within the Taiwan Strait after the mei-yu front reached northern Taiwan. In the later period, the front moved southward faster to the area immediately east of Taiwan as compared to that over southwestern Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait due to earlier arrival of strong postfrontal northerly winds. The localized southwesterly jetlike feature was observed to the southeast of Taiwan and persisted until the arrival of the strong northerly winds. These localized phenomena were detected by the QuikSCAT oceanic winds. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{nature and}} {{movements}} of ionospheric irregularities at E- and F-region heights are considered. Experimental evidence from a mid-latitude station is discussed {{which suggests that}} the night-time irregularities which produce the spread-F, spread-E 8 or sporadic-E-cloud features on ionograms represent a class of irregularities which are <b>frontal</b> <b>disturbances.</b> These have quasi-sinusoidal cross sections at F-region heights. Wavelengths range from 25 to 350 km and periods range from 5 to 60 min. Their characteristics indicate that they may be produced by internal gravity waves propagating through the ionospheric regions. These night-time irregularities are somewhat similar to daytime travelling ionospheric disturbances which have been in the past, associated, by certain workers, with internal gravity waves. Another class of irregularities, with dimensions of the order of a kilometre, appear to be responsible for the fading patterns from which ionospheric drifts are calculated. When the movements of the two classes of irregularities are compared a certain amount of agreement is evident. It is suggested that, because of this association between drift velocities and the movements of the larger-scale irregularities, the drift measurements are, at times, influenced by the presence of internal gravity waves...|$|R

40|$|Nonlinear model {{simulations}} of a coastal upwelling system show frontal instabilities that initiate at short alongshore scales but rapidly evolve to longer wavelengths. Several {{factors associated with}} the nonstationarity of this basic state contribute to the progression in scale. A portion of the system evolution {{is associated with the}} external forcing. Another portion is associated with the alteration of the alongshore mean flow resulting from wave growth. Direct interactions between the finite-amplitude disturbances also promote emergence of new scales. The relative role of each of these mechanisms is isolated through tangent linear simulations about basic states that approximate the nonlinear system to differing degrees. The basic states include an alongshore uniform time-evolving upwelling solution, the alongshore average of a three-dimensionally evolving upwelling solution, and the full three-dimensional nonlinear solution. Disturbance growth about a frozen-field upwelling state is also examined. Perturbation experiments are performed for persistent and relaxed wind forcing. Although the <b>frontal</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the nonlinear model exhibit a progression to larger scale over the full range of forcing scenarios considered, the mechanisms most responsible for the process differ between wind-forced and unforced cases. Under relaxed wind conditions, the perturbation growth experiments indicate that the scale evolution over the first four days is reflected in the way linear disturbances respond to the adjustment of an alongshore uniform upwelling front to wind cessation. The continued increase in scale between days 4 and 7 is related to the linear disturbance evolution on the alongshore average of a flow state that has been altered by wave–mean flow interaction. Past day 7, the observed scale change is not captured in the linear growth experiments and evidently results largely from nonlinear wave–wave interaction processes. Under sustained upwelling winds, the linear growth experiments fail to describe even the earliest scale change in the nonlinear solutions, indicating that nonlinear wave–wave effects are significant from very near the start of the simulations...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing {{analyses}} of observational data, {{we performed a}} detailed study to investigate short-period atmospheric gravity waves and ripples, and instabilities in the mesopause region. Recent coordinated measurements from Haleakala Observatory, Maui, HI via airglow wave imaging, meteor wind radar, and Na wind temperature lidar have provided a unique dataset for this study. Gravity waves generated in the lower atmosphere propagate energy upwards into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region where they modulate the airglow emissions, and later break and deposit their momentum, causing significant perturbations in winds and temperatures. Ripples, on the other hand, are likely generated by localized shear instabilities in the background wind eld, and are also observed frequently in airglow images. First, we investigated the frequency of occurrence and climatology of ripples and their seasonal variation in propagation directions of motion. These novel results were then used to characterize {{the nature of the}} observed ripples and to identify individual Kelvin Helmholtz instability events as their sources, which were consistent with theoretical computations. The results provided insight to better quantify seasonal wave anisotropy and instability dynamics in the mesopause. Second, we investigated ground-relative and intrinsic properties of gravity waves that were Doppler-ducted or evanescent. The results were then compared with an analytical model and numerical model simulations for the Doppler-ducted and evanescent waves, demonstrating signicant dierences in wave structures for apparently similar wave events. Results reinforced the need to better understand the dynamics of wave ducting and their importance for momentum and energy transports at upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere heights. Third, we investigated the frequency of occurrence of <b>frontal</b> <b>disturbances</b> and the appearance of complementary intensities in OH and O 2 airglow emissions. We have analyzed ducting conditions of mesospheric bores. One bore event was trapped in a stable Doppler duct arising from wind structure, and other bore events were trapped within thermal inversion layers.

These studies provide an extensive dataset for detailing the morphology and dynamics of mesospheric frontal events...|$|R

The majority of studies of both inter-ictal and post-ictal psychoses have strongly suggested the influence of temporal lobe disturbance on psychoses. Patients with organic brain damage or schizophrenia, however, sometimes show frontal lobe dysfunction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to better understand the effect, if any, of <b>frontal</b> lobe <b>disturbance</b> and seizure on psychopathology. Patients were divided into four groups based on epilepsy type and preceding seizures; 8 with FLE/inter-ictal psychosis, 3 with FLE/post-ictal psychosis, 29 with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) /inter-ictal psychosis, and 8 with TLE/post-ictal psychosis. Psychopathologic symptoms were retrospectively reviewed based on case notes, using a modified brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS). Psychomotor excitement, hostility, suspiciousness, and hallucinatory behaviour were prominent features in all four groups. Six orthogonal factors were derived by factor analysis from the original data based on the 18 BPRS items. FLE patients with inter-ictal psychosis showed marked hebephrenic characteristics (i. e. emotional withdrawal and blunted effect).

40|$|Abstract: Temporal lobe {{epilepsy}} (TLE) can be {{conceptualized as}} a network disease. The network {{can be characterized}} by inter-regional functional connectivity, i. e. blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal correlations between any two region pairs. However, functional connectivity is not constant over time, thus computing correlation {{at a given time}} and then at some later time could give different results (non-stationarity). We hypothesized (1) that non-stationarities can be induced by epilepsy (e. g. interictal epileptic activity) increasing local signal variance and that (2) these transient events contribute to fluctuations in connectivity leading to pathological functioning, i. e. TLE semiology. We analyzed fMRI data from 27 patients with TLE and 22 healthy controls focusing on EEG-confirmed wake epochs only to protect against sleep-induced connectivity changes. Testing hypothesis (1), we identified brain regions where the BOLD signal variance was significantly greater in TLE than in controls: the temporal pole - including the hippocampus. Taking the latter as the seed region and testing hypothesis (2) we calculated the time-varying interregional correlation values (dynamic functional connectivity) to other brain regions and found greater connectivity variance in the TLE than the control group mainly in the precuneus, the supplementary and sensori-motor and the frontal cortices. We conclude that the highest BOLD signal variance in the hippocampi is highly suggestive of a specific epilepsy-related effect. The altered connectivity dynamics in TLE patients might help to explain the hallmark semiological features of dyscognitive seizures including impaired consciousness (precuneus, <b>frontal</b> cortex), sensory <b>disturbance</b> and motor automatisms (sensorimotor cortices, supplementary motor cortex). Accounting for the non-stationarity and state-dependence of functional connectivity are a prerequisite in the search for potential connectivity-derived biomarkers in TLE...|$|R

We hypothesized that participants with frontotemporal dementia taking memantine would show an increased cortical metabolic activity in frontal regions, temporal regions, or in salience network hubs. Methods: Sixteen participants with behavioral or language variant frontotemporal dementia syndromes (FTD) were recruited from tertiary FTD clinics and treated with memantine hydrochloride 10 mg twice daily in this fixed-dose, open-label pilot study. The primary endpoint was enhancement of cortical metabolic activity after 7 &ndash; 8 weeks of treatment. Secondary endpoints were measures of mood and behavior <b>disturbance,</b> <b>frontal</b> executive function, and motor disturbance. Results: Voxel-wise parametric image analysis of positron emission tomography (PET) data from seven behavioral variant FTD patients, eight semantic dementia patients, and one progressive nonfluent aphasia patient, of mean age 64. 3 years, mean duration of illness 4. 25 years, and baseline mean sum of boxes Clinical Dementia Rating score 6. 59, revealed an increase in [18 F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) normalized metabolic activity in bilateral insulae and the left orbitofrontal cortex (P &lt; 0. 01). The increase on FDG-PET did not correlate with changes on behavioral inventories. Post hoc analysis indicated that semantic dementia participants drove this finding. Conclusion: This open-label clinical PET study suggests that memantine induces an increase in metabolism in the salience network in FTD. A placebo-controlled follow-up study is warranted.

40|$|There are {{approximately}} 10 million children suffering from epilepsy worldwide, with additionally 1, 4 million children up to 15 years old developing epilepsy annually. Except seizures, epilepsy {{also includes a}} number of other aspects: behavioral and psychological problems, cognitive disability, psychiatric and other neurologic problems, and even suddendeath. Among those comorbidities, cognitive impairment is very common in childhood epilepsy as 20 - 30 % patients have mental retardation with IQ In human cognition, working memory constitutes an importantpart as it lies at the basis of complex higher cognitive functions likereading, language comprehension, mathematical abilities, spatial processing, planning, and other executive functions. In a number of studies, working memory impairments in childhood epilepsy have already been shown. However, event-related potentials (ERP) studies are lacking inresearch on WM functioning in childhood epilepsy. ERP is a non-invasivetechnique with high temporal resolution, which is able to provide a neurophysiological index of the patients cognitive functioning. Therefore we set up this project to study the effect of childhood epilepsy on the development of working memory using a combined approach of neuropsychology and ERP methodology. We aimed to show that epilepsy can disturb working memory functioning in children with epilepsy. Firs t, westudied electrophysiological patterns of visuo-spatial working memory development in a group of healthy and normally developing children in theage range of 6 to 16 years old. An n-backmatching paradigm was used to measure the electrophysiological patterns of working memory development. Behaviorally, children made fewer errors and reacted faster as they got older. ERP analysis showed clear developmental changes: shortening of peak latencies and lowering of peak amplitudes with age, although this was not uniform across the peaks. Exogenous components (N 150, P 250) showed shortening of the latency and lowering of the amplitude with age. On the contrary, endogenous components (N 400, P 450) did not always follow this principle. Our results show that in normal children different ERP components follow different developmental trajectories with the endogenous components developing later. When the fronto-parietal visuo-spatial working memory network is already active, not all its nodes are equally mature, so that a child is able to perform in a working memory task, but this performance is not yet perfect. In a next step, visual and visuo-spatial working memory was studied in two groups of normally developing children with well-controlled epilepsy using 1 - and 2 -backmatching tasks. Children with epilepsy performed equally well on the easy BM 1 task but made significantly more omission errors during the more difficult BM 2 task. At the electrophysiological level we found in the epilepsy group significantly increased ERP amplitudes over frontal and central regions during the late processing stages (in the time intervals 250 - 425 msec and 300 - 500 msec post stimulus). Our findings therefore indicate that even during an easy working memory task children with epilepsy have to develop more effort to achieve normal results. This is a reflection of an adequate compensatory mechanism: increased activity of morphologically normal working memory neuronal circuits in patients with normalintelligence in order to overcome the decrease in neurocognitive efficiency caused by the epilepsy and to achieve the same level of performanceas control non-epileptic children. Increasing of task demands leads to exhaustion of this compensatory mechanism: in a difficult task a larger amplitude difference was seen and this was still not sufficient to preserve performance at the level of non-epileptic controls. Next weexamined whether those findings are specific for children with epilepsy, or whether it is a more general phenomenon related to frontal dysfunction rather than to a particular pathology. We selected a patient control group consisting of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This disease is known with <b>frontal</b> functions <b>disturbances</b> and in particular with working memory problems. The same 1 - and 2 -backmatching visuo-spatial working memory tasks were applied to the ADHD and the control group. We did not find any time intervals of significant ERP amplitude difference between ADHD patients and controls, which proves that the ERP amplitude increase during the late processing stages of working memory is specific for epilepsy. Our studies confirm the role of the epilepsy in the development of WM disturbances in childhood epilepsy and stresses the importance of addressing the cognitive problems in children with epilepsy. In order to prevent or correct cognitive dysfunctions in these children, one should theoretically target the epilepticprocess itself, and not only the seizures. status: publishe...|$|R
