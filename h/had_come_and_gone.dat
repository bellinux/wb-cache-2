5|$|In 1950, {{science fiction}} (sf) {{magazines}} {{had been published}} successfully in North America for over twenty years, but little progress {{had been made in}} establishing British equivalents. The bulk of British sf was published as paperback books, rather than magazines; a situation opposite of that in the US. Several short-lived magazines <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> {{both before and after the}} war. John Spencer launched four very poor quality juvenile magazines in 1950, which continued into the mid-1950s, while one magazine, New Worlds, had survived since 1946. Since 1939, Atlas, a British publisher, had been producing a reprint edition of Astounding Science Fiction, one of the most well-regarded American sf magazines. During the war the contents had often been cut severely, and the schedule had not been regular, but it was reputed to sell 40,000 copies a month. This was enough to attract the attention of Hamilton & Co., a British publisher looking for new markets.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, Sinn Féin {{represented}} change and a radical new policy for achieving Irish self-government {{outside of the}} UK, {{and many of its}} Volunteer wing were ready to defend a republic with physical force. By 1918, Sinn Féin followers had come to see the gradual acquisition of All-Ireland Home Rule as an idea whose time <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2002–03, Southampton {{finished}} {{eighth in}} the league and finished runners-up in the FA Cup to Arsenal (after losing 1–0 at the Millennium Stadium), thanks in no small part to the metamorphosis of James Beattie, who fired home 24 goals, 23 in the league. Strachan resigned in March 2004 and within eight months, two different managers – Paul Sturrock and Steve Wigley – <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone.</b> Chairman Rupert Lowe risked the ire of Saints fans when he appointed Harry Redknapp as manager on 8 December 2004, just after his resignation at South Coast rivals Portsmouth. He brought in a number of new signings, including his son Jamie in the attempt to survive relegation. Southampton were relegated from the Premier League {{on the last day of}} the season, ending 27 successive seasons of top flight football for the club. Their relegation was ironically confirmed by a 2–1 home defeat to Manchester United, who had been on the receiving end of many upsets by Southampton over the years, namely in the 1976 FA Cup final and since then on a number of occasions in the league, as well as inflicting a heavy defeat on them in a November 1986 League Cup tie which cost United manager Ron Atkinson his job.|$|E

500|$|During the Roman {{invasion}} of Britain the [...] "King of Orkney" [...] {{was one of}} 11 British leaders {{who is said to}} have submitted to the Emperor Claudius in AD 43 at Colchester. After the Agricolan fleet <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone,</b> possibly anchoring at Shapinsay, direct Roman influence seems to have been limited to trade rather than conquest.|$|E
500|$|After {{the failure}} of the all-conservative government, the Grand Duchess turned to the leading liberal politician, Victor Thorn, to form a new government. [...] After Eyschen's premiership of 27 years, two governments <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> in three months, and the Luxembourgish people were {{becoming}} disillusioned with {{the failure of}} the politicians. [...] Thorn's nature was to be a conciliatory leader, and he made a direct appeal to the Chamber of Deputies to support his government, no matter the deputies' individual ideological persuasions: [...] "If you want a government that acts, and is capable of acting, it is imperative that all parties support this government." [...] This support was forthcoming from all parties, but only on the condition that each was invited into the government; Thorn was left with no choice but to afford them this. [...] The resulting grand coalition cabinet included every leading light in Luxembourgish politics; besides Thorn himself, there were the conservatives Léon Kauffmann and Antoine Lefort, the socialist leader Dr Michel Welter, and the liberal Léon Moutrier.|$|E
500|$|Mia Farrow, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> {{from the}} ashram before, left again and drifted around India before {{returning}} to the United States. Geoffrey Giuliano in Revolver: The Secret History of the Beatles says that, before leaving, she told the Beatles that the Maharishi had made a pass at her. Ned Wynn, one of Farrow's childhood friends, wrote in his 1990 memoir that she had told him in the early 1970s that the Maharishi had definitely made sexual passes at her. In her 1993 autobiography, Cooke de Herrera wrote that Farrow had confided to her, before the arrival of the Beatles, that the Maharishi had made a pass during a private puja ceremony by stroking her hair. Cooke de Herrera wrote that she told Farrow that she had misinterpreted the Maharishi's actions. Farrow's 1997 memoirs are ambiguous, describing an encounter with the Maharishi in his private meditation [...] "cave" [...] when he tried to put his arms around her. She reports that her sister Prudence told her that it was [...] "an honour" [...] and [...] "a tradition" [...] for a [...] "holy man" [...] to touch someone after meditation.|$|E

500|$|In the United Kingdom, the Beatles had {{experienced}} popularity {{since the start}} of 1963. But in the United States, Capitol Records, owned by the band's record company EMI, had for most of the year declined to issue any of the singles. The phenomenon of Beatlemania in the UK was regarded with amusement by the U.S. press, once it made any comment. When newspaper and magazine articles did begin to appear towards the end of 1963, they cited the English stereotype of eccentricity, reporting that the UK had developed an interest in something that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> a long time ago in the United States: rock and roll. Headlines included [...] "The New Madness" [...] and [...] "Beatle Bug Bites Britain", and writers employed word-play linking [...] "beetle" [...] with the [...] "infestation" [...] afflicting the UK. In late 1963, Capitol Records agreed to release the single [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] with a large accompanying promotional campaign, due to Ed Sullivan's agreement to headline the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. The Beatles' American television debut was on 18 November 1963 on The Huntley-Brinkley Report, with a four-minute long piece by Edwin Newman. On 22 November 1963, the CBS Morning News ran a five-minute feature on Beatlemania in the UK which heavily featured their then current UK hit [...] "She Loves You". The evening's scheduled repeat was cancelled following the assassination of JohnF. Kennedy the same day. On 10 December, Walter Cronkite decided to transmit the piece again on the CBS Evening News, and the resulting interest led to the rush-release of [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand" [...] and—only weeks before the Beatles' arrival—a U.S. commercial breakthrough.|$|E
2500|$|The {{date was}} an April Fools' Day joke because the {{original}} six owners {{believed that their}} prospect was going to fail. Their first Hooters restaurant {{was built on the}} site of a former rundown nightclub that had been purchased at a low price. So many businesses had folded in that particular location that the Hooters founders built a small [...] "graveyard" [...] at the front door for each that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> before them. The first restaurant opened its doors on October 4, 1983, in Clearwater. [...] This original location was decorated with memorabilia from Waverly, Iowa, hometown to some of the original Hooters 6.|$|E
2500|$|When back at Sant'Agata in late January 1853 Verdi was {{reminded}} that his contract called {{for him to}} be in Venice within a week or two and for the premiere to be held on the [...] "first Saturday in March 1853". However, {{it soon became clear that}} a modern-dress staging of the new opera was impossible—the requirement was that it should be set in the 17th century [...] "in the era of Richelieu"—and reports from the opening of the season confirmed the limitations of the chosen soprano, the 38-year-old Fanny Salvini-Donatelli for taking the role of Violetta. Verdi was distraught, for he held on to the notion that the opera could be staged in modern dress—as Stiffelio had been done—Piave was sent back to Sant'Agata to no avail: he could not persuade the composer to back down on his insistence that another soprano be secured, yet the 15 January deadline for securing one <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone.</b> Verdi was filled with premonitions of disaster upon his arrival in Venice on 21 February for rehearsals and he made his unhappiness clear to the singers.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{the works}} {{recorded}} by Capitol Records, [...] "Incident in Jazz" [...] {{is probably the}} most compositionally unified of Graettinger's and shows his full capabilities as an orchestral writer in progressive jazz or as a Third stream music composer (the work was originally entitled [...] "Incident in Sound"). [...] This is part of the new [...] "Innovations" [...] orchestra that Stan Kenton had marshalled into the studio to record these groundbreaking sides. Kenton comments on the unprecedented conditions this orchestra operated under, [...] "The Capitol people were with me all the way. There were tremendous sums of money involved in recording this orchestra and selling the music that was of such an unusual nature. I remember hour upon hour in the studio while we were recording, and there was no thought of how much it would cost: the thought was only to make the finest recordings that we knew how." [...] The largesse of Capitol Records and Kenton himself would only last (roughly) six months until a more conventional, financially solvent Kenton 'dance' orchestra would be reformed to cut sides with the popular Capitol artist Nat King Cole. Graettinger's [...] "House of Strings" [...] (Aug 24, 1950) is recorded on a split session with popular Les Baxter sides; the Kenton 'Innovations Orchestra' as a regular touring and studio unit <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>and</b> <b>gone</b> quickly due to financial failure.|$|E
