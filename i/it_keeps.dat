The roof opens up over the platform and rail to avoid a piston effect and the style responds to the local environment. The station has become the new landmark of Hsinchu.|$|E

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Schuyler Avenue (which runs as Hudson County Route 507 {{to the south}} of Route 7 and Bergen County Route 130 to the north of Route 7), the road turns NNW, narrowing again to two lanes undivided. In this portion of the route, it had a concurrency with County Route 507 (both Bergen and Hudson counties). <b>It</b> <b>keeps</b> this configuration for about a half mile, as it still runs along the Kearny/North Arlington border. At that point, it meets the southern terminus of State Route 17 (Ridge Road) and the northern terminus of Hudson County Route 697 (Kearny Avenue).|$|E
5|$|NY33 {{becomes a}} two-lane route once again as it heads out into Alden and {{eventually}} joins another state-maintained street radiating {{out from the}} city, Walden Avenue, unsigned NY952Q. NY33 and the Genesee Street name take over Walden's straight, slightly north-trending course as it leaves Erie County for Genesee County. In the latter, it intersects with NY77 {{in the center of}} the first community it encounters, the small village of Corfu. At the Batavia town line, it becomes Pearl Street, a name <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> until it reaches NY98 within the city of Batavia.|$|E
5|$|The nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} constructs a clustering in time {{proportional to}} {{the square of the}} number of points to be clustered. This is also {{proportional to the}} size of its input, when the input is provided {{in the form of an}} explicit distance matrix. The algorithm uses an amount of memory proportional to the number of points, when it is used for clustering methods such as Ward's method that allow constant-time calculation of the distance between clusters. However, for some other clustering methods it uses a larger amount of memory in an auxiliary data structure with which <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> track of the distances between pairs of clusters.|$|E

EuroBillTracker has registered over 155 million notes as of May 2016, worth more than €2.897 billion.|$|E
5|$|Triton's {{rotation}} is tidally locked to be synchronous {{with its}} orbit around Neptune: <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> one face oriented toward the planet at all times. Its equator is almost exactly aligned with its orbital plane. At the present time, Triton's rotational axis is about 40° from Neptune's orbital plane, and hence {{at some point}} during Neptune's year each pole points fairly close to the Sun, almost like the poles of Uranus. As Neptune orbits the Sun, Triton's polar regions take turns facing the Sun, resulting in seasonal changes as one pole, then the other, moves into the sunlight. Such changes were observed in 2010.|$|E

It {{initially}} heads south through Yuma until the interchange with US95, where the freeway begins {{to turn to}} the east and passes through eastern Yuma and Fortuna Foothills, briefly paralleling US95. West of Wellton, the highway takes a northeasterly course, paralleling the Gila River and passing to the south of Roll. Through this part of Arizona, I-8 passes along the northern edge of the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range and to the south of the Yuma Proving Ground. <b>It</b> <b>keeps</b> a northeastern heading, passing through the community of Dateland, until it reaches Gila Bend.

Since there is no formal registration process and no official membership count has ever been taken, the exact membership statistics remain unknown. The movement discourages interviews with its elders and has never officially released texts, although there are publications associated with the movement (usually referred as TablighiNisaab (Tablighi Curriculum).

5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom {{is low in}} fat and digestible carbohydrates, and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. <b>It</b> <b>keeps</b> its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance to toxic heavy metals.|$|E
5|$|In the lower, broader {{part of the}} estuary near Avonmouth, {{the tidal}} surge {{advances}} as a slight roll in the deepwater channels and the water rapidly spreads across the sands and mudbanks. Past Sharpness, the bore begins to form and when it encounters the large left-handed bend at Hock Cliff, it crashes headlong into the rocks. Reforming, it runs up-river close to the Overton shore before crossing the estuary towards Box Cliff. As it rounds the Horseshoe Bend <b>it</b> <b>keeps</b> to the outside but it afterwards moves across to {{the eastern side of}} the river. Above Langney Sands, the river abruptly narrows to a hundred yards, the sands diminish and the channel occupies the whole of the river. Now the bore is recognisably the spectacular phenomenon that people expect rather than a swelling flood of water. From Minsterworth to Gloucester, the width of the river varies little and the bore continues unhindered, climbing the banks on the outer side of bends and breaking over shallow places. At Lower Parting, close to Gloucester, it splits in two to pass either side of Alney Island. Both branches encounter and overcome weirs and rejoin at Upper Parting, and the much diminished bore continues upstream. In particularly high tides the water may overtop the weir at Tewkesbury, and even the foot of the weir at Worcester may experience a rise in water level of a foot or so.|$|E
