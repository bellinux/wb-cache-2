5|$|The {{original}} Lunar Lander {{game was}} a 1969 text-based game called Lunar, or alternately the Lunar Landing Game. It was originally {{written in the}} FOCAL programming language for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-8 minicomputer by Jim Storer while a student at Lexington High School {{in the fall of}} 1969. Storer submitted the game to the DEC users' newsletter, which distributed the source code to readers. Other versions of the concept were written soon after: a version called Rocket was written <b>in</b> <b>BASIC</b> by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II <b>in</b> <b>BASIC,</b> among others.|$|E

5|$|Based at the Army's {{headquarters}} in Melbourne, the AES {{started out with}} 43 assigned personnel, but expanded as the war progressed. By 1944 the unit comprised 963 on staff, including instructors, teachers, and administrators and had established offices down to the regimental level. In 1943 the AES established two schools, one in Western Australia {{and the other in}} New South Wales, to provide education <b>in</b> <b>basic</b> education skills to illiterate Army recruits.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{the members}} were working their band {{schedule}} round their jobs they had to practice <b>in</b> <b>basic</b> recording rooms and write and record their own ideas. From this the members listened to each other's ideas and gave their interpretations and evaluations. Synthesiser player James felt the band produced their best work with this method as they were constantly assessing themselves.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Favaloro {{established}} the 'Basic Investigation Laboratory' (Laboratorio de Investigación Básica), which was long financed {{with his own}} money and which, at the time, depended upon {{the support of the}} Research and Teaching Department of the Fundación Favaloro. Subsequently it became the Institute of Research <b>in</b> <b>Basic</b> Sciences of the University Institute of Biomedical Sciences (Instituto de Investigación en Ciencias Básicas del Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Biomédicas) which in turn, was transformed into the Universidad Favaloro in August 1998.|$|E

5|$|Institutions {{offering}} {{degrees in}} nursing {{had to be}} accredited by the appropriate nursing agency for universities and colleges. The curriculum had to include all units of instruction necessary to conform with accepted practices <b>in</b> <b>basic</b> nursing education. It had to be arranged so the entire program of combined study and practice would be completed in 24 to 30 months. The standards of the National League of Nursing Education were {{to be used as}} a guide for evaluating the adequacy of school facilities to meet the requirements specified.|$|E
5|$|The Institute of Education and Pedagogy was {{established}} on February 10, 2003, {{to replace the}} Faculty of Education, established in 1962. It offers the undergraduate degree of Bachelor of Education, with emphasis <b>in</b> <b>Basic</b> Education, Math and Physics, Physical Education and Sports, Popular Education; and the degrees of Professional in Recreation, Professional in Political studies and conflict resolution, and Professional in Sport Sciences. It also offers the graduate degrees by research of Master and Doctor of Education.|$|E

40|$|Nickel {{chloride}} was {{studied with}} cyclic voltammetry and X-ray absorption spectroscopy <b>in</b> acidic and <b>basic</b> aluminum chloride/ 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium chloride (EMIC) ionic liquids. Acidic melts display metal stripping peaks {{which are not}} observed <b>in</b> the <b>basic</b> melt. EXAFS analysis shows that the nickel is tetrahedrally coordinated with chloride ions <b>in</b> the <b>basic</b> solution. <b>In</b> the acidic solution the nickel is coordinated by six chloride ions that are also associated with aluminum ions...|$|R
5|$|The {{creation}} of general programming languages like BASIC, {{which could be}} run on different hardware types, allowed for programs to be written {{for more than one}} specific computer, in turn letting games written in them to spread to more end players in the programming community than before. These games included a baseball simulation game written <b>in</b> <b>BASIC</b> by John Kemeny in 1965; a BASIC bingo game by Larry Bethurum in 1966; a basketball simulation game written <b>in</b> <b>BASIC</b> by Charles R. Bacheller in May 1967; another baseball game that simulates the 1967 World Series written <b>in</b> <b>BASIC</b> by Jacob Bergmann in August 1967; Space Travel, written by Ken Thompson for a Multics system in 1969 and which led in part {{to the development of the}} Unix operating system; and Hamurabi, a text-based FOCAL game written by Doug Dyment in 1968 and converted to BASIC by David H. Ahl in 1969, and one of the first strategy video games ever made. Hamurabi and Space Travel were among several early mainframe games that were written during the time, and spread beyond their initial mainframe computers to general-purpose languages like BASIC.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} staff {{consisted of}} two programmers, Joel Billings and John Lyons, who programmed the game <b>in</b> <b>BASIC.</b> Originally developed for the TRS-80, an Apple II version was also created two months into the process. After meeting with other wargame developers, Billings decided to publish the game as well. To help accomplish this, he hired Louis Saekow to create the box art.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is similar}} to its {{predecessor}} <b>in</b> <b>basic</b> gameplay, but differs by adding multiple storylines, more playable characters and increased interaction with environments. A two-player co-op mode is also available for some missions. As with The Two Towers, The Return of the King was developed in close collaboration with the filmmakers, using many of the actual reference photos, drawings, models, props and other assets from the film. The game was met with positive critical reception for its graphics, audio, and gameplay, although its camera positioning and short length were criticized.|$|E
40|$|Tantalum {{chloride}} was {{studied with}} extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) <b>in</b> acidic and <b>basic</b> aluminum chloride/ 1 -ethyl- 3 -methyl imidazolium chloride ionic liquids (ILs). Anhydrous Ta 2 Cl 10 is more soluble <b>in</b> the <b>basic</b> solution than <b>in</b> the acidic solution and the X-ray absorption {{data show that}} the coordination shell of chlorides around the tantalum is larger <b>in</b> the <b>basic</b> solution. <b>In</b> the acidic solution, tantalum has five chlorides in its coordination shell, while <b>in</b> the <b>basic</b> solution, the tantalum is coordinated by seven chlorides. This indicates that the Lewis acidity of the tantalum chloride causes the Ta to coordinate differently in the acidic and the basic solutions...|$|R

5|$|The other game Ahl {{originally}} ported to BASIC, Lunar Lander, {{appeared in}} the book in three different forms. The original version of the game was called Lunar, and was originally written in FOCAL for the PDP-8 by Jim Storer while {{a high school student}} in the fall of 1969. A different version called Rocket was written <b>in</b> <b>BASIC</b> by Eric Peters at DEC, and a third version, LEM, was written by William Labaree II <b>in</b> <b>BASIC.</b> Ahl converted Jim Storer's FOCAL version to BASIC, changed some of the text, and published it in his newsletter. A year or so later, all three BASIC versions of the game appeared in 101 BASIC Computer Games, under the names ROCKET (Storer version), ROCKT1 (Peters version), and ROCKT2 (Labaree version). All three text-based games required the player to control a rocket attempting to land on the moon by entering instructions to the rocket in response to the textual summary of its current position and heading relative to the ground. Ahl and Steve North converted all three versions to Microsoft BASIC, changed the collective name to Lunar Lander, and published them in Creative Computing magazine in 1976; that name was used in the 1978 edition of BASIC Computer Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{return of}} Australian {{personnel}} from the SWPA was delayed by shipping shortages {{and the need}} to maintain a force in the area for garrison duties. The military provided these personnel with training courses to prepare them for civilian life. Refresher courses <b>in</b> <b>basic</b> subjects such as maths and English were run first before vocational training began. The teachers and instructors for these courses were service personnel {{selected on the basis of}} their civilian occupations. In addition, sport competitions were conducted to keep the men busy.|$|E

5|$|The three coves to {{the east}} of Helvellyn are all {{important}} sites for remnant populations of arctic-alpine plants. Species such as downy willow (Salix lapponum), mountain avens (Dryas octopetala), alpine mouse-ear (Cerastium alpinum), alpine meadowgrass (Poa alpina) and others have been able to survive in these coves since the last glaciation through a combination of rocks rich <b>in</b> <b>basic</b> minerals, a harsh micro-climate, and inaccessibility to grazing sheep on cliff ledges. However, these populations are small and are not reproducing well. Natural England has introduced a recovery plan for them.|$|E
