5|$|Although {{the usual}} natural numbers satisfy the axioms of PA, {{there are other}} models as well (called {{non-standard}} models); the compactness theorem implies {{that the existence of}} nonstandard elements cannot be excluded in first-order logic. The upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem shows that there are nonstandard models of PA of all infinite cardinalities. This is not the case for the original (second-order) Peano axioms, which have only one model, up to <b>isomorphism.</b> This illustrates one way the first-order system PA is weaker than the second-order Peano axioms.|$|E

5|$|As a {{consequence}} of bounded expansion, the subgraph <b>isomorphism</b> problem, of finding whether a pattern graph of bounded size exists as a subgraph of a larger graph, can be solved in linear time when the larger graph has bounded book thickness. The {{same is true for}} detecting whether the pattern graph is an induced subgraph of the larger graph, or whether it has a graph homomorphism to the larger graph. For the same reason, the problem of testing whether a graph of bounded book thickness obeys a given formula of first order logic is fixed-parameter tractable.|$|E

5|$|When {{interpreted}} as a proof within a first-order set theory, such as ZFC, Dedekind's categoricity proof for PA shows that each model of set theory has a unique model of the Peano axioms, up to <b>isomorphism,</b> that embeds as an initial segment of all other models of PA contained within that model of set theory. In the standard model of set theory, this smallest model of PA is the standard model of PA; however, in a nonstandard model of set theory, {{it may be a}} nonstandard model of PA. This situation cannot be avoided with any first-order formalization of set theory.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an <b>isomorphism</b> between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web of beliefs. Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true.

However for some groups there exist not regular automata <b>isomorphisms.</b> A complete description of linear automorphisms of the monoid is obtained.
