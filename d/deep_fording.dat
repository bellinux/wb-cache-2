50|$|Bina is an unincorporated {{community}} in Ashe County, North Carolina, United States. It is located southeast of Lansing on North Carolina Highway 194, along with W. <b>Deep</b> <b>Ford</b> Road, and McNeil Road.|$|R
50|$|Adjacent to {{the mill}} are two <b>deep</b> <b>fords</b> {{which can be}} crossed by car with care, {{allowing}} a road connection between the A5 and A6 near Harpenden. The fords are occasionally used {{as part of the}} route on local road rallies because of their tricky nature; following the wrong line can drop you into much deeper water without warning.|$|R

5000|$|WPT-34 (1960s) - Polish {{repair and}} {{maintenance}} vehicle with a superstructure replacing the casemate, a crane, a large-diameter telescoping snorkel for <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> operations {{as well as}} a large-spade type earth anchor in the rear. It was converted from SU-85 tank destroyers as well as T-34 medium tanks and SU-100 tank destroyers.|$|E
50|$|<b>Deep</b> <b>fording</b> {{capability}} {{is important for}} military vehicles because bridges may be destroyed during conflict to prevent crossing, and smaller bridges {{may not be able}} to support heavier tanks to begin with. Making a vehicle capable of navigating relatively shallow water counters this problem without the expense and technical difficulties of floating the entire vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II a {{different}} type of crankcase ventilation had to be invented to allow tank engines to operate during <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> operations, where the normal draft tube ventilator would have allowed water to enter the crankcase and destroy the engine. [...] The PCV system and its control valve were invented to meet this need, but no need for it on automobiles was recognized.|$|E
50|$|The town, {{originally}} {{known as}} <b>Deep</b> <b>Ford,</b> {{was established in}} 1872 with the reservation for the Osage Nation, part of Indian Territory. The Osage Indian Agency was located along Bird Creek. One of the three main bands of the tribe settled here. Traders followed, building stores during 1872 and 1873. Pawhuska's first newspaper, the Indian Herald (also known as Wah-Sha-She News.), was founded in 1875 by George Edward Tinker, an Osage who became the father of Clarence L. Tinker, highest-ranking Native American officer in the US Army. The first post office opened in 1876.|$|R
50|$|In 1870, the Osage finally {{prepared}} for removal from Kansas, after having negotiated payment for their land. They purchased 1.57 e6acre km2 {{of their former}} territory in present-day Oklahoma from the Cherokee. By owning it by title, they had a stronger position {{in relation to the}} US government than did other tribes. The Osage Agency was established in 1872 at <b>Deep</b> <b>Ford,</b> later renamed as Pawhuska. It was designated as the county seat when Oklahoma was admitted as a state. The other chief settlements in the 1870s were Hominy and Fairfax; each of the three was settled by a major Osage band.|$|R

50|$|Many {{different}} attached implements for the T-26 light tank {{were developed}} in the USSR in the 1930s. Among these were mine sweeps, equipment for swimming, snorkels for <b>deep</b> <b>fording,</b> wooden and brushwood fascines for trench crossing, special extra-wide swamp tracks and mats, wire cutters, dozer blades and many others. All of them were tested but despite often excellent test results none (except some mine sweeps) passed into army service.|$|E
5000|$|Deep wading or <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> is a {{technique}} used by some heavy semi-amphibious vehicles to traverse water that is several metres deep - the vehicle drives on the riverbed/lakebed/seabed and uses screens or a pipe (a snorkel) that reaches above the water surface for an air supply. The technique {{has been used by}} armoured military vehicles such as tanks and armored personnel carriers. <b>Deep</b> <b>fording</b> generally implies driving through water of such a depth that the vehicle is mostly or entirely submerged by the water, sometimes to several times the height of the vehicle itself, as well as a sealed crew compartment, complete with air supply for the crew. This makes it different from the less extreme [...] "wading" [...] done by many off-road vehicles which are simply fitted with a snorkel that is higher than the normal engine air intake, roughly level with the top of the cab. In these cases, the crew compartment is not watertight, and the snorkel provides air only for the engine. Thus maximum height is limited by the crew's need to breathe, and very rarely completely submerges the vehicle.|$|E
50|$|The Tiger {{tank was}} too heavy for small bridges, so it was {{designed}} to ford four-metres deep in water. This required unusual mechanisms for ventilation and cooling when underwater. At least 30 minutes of set-up time was required, with the turret and gun being locked in the forward position, and a large snorkel tube raised at the rear. An inflatable doughnut-shaped ring sealed the turret ring. The two rear compartments (each containing a fuel tank, radiator and fans) were floodable. Only the first 495 units were fitted with this <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> system; all later models were capable of fording only two metres.|$|E
50|$|The {{electrical}} system was upgraded to a 24 volt system which required dual 12 volt batteries connected in series. Its ignition and {{electrical system}}s were waterproof; a handy feature in rainy environments and where <b>deep</b> river <b>fording</b> was necessary.|$|R

5000|$|Battle of Marilao River (March 27, 1899) - {{in one of}} {{the most}} celebrated river {{crossings}} of the war, American forces crossed the Marilao river (80 yards wide and too <b>deep</b> to <b>ford)</b> while under fire from the opposite bank.|$|R
50|$|A vehicle snorkel is the {{land-based}} {{equivalent of}} the submarine snorkel which allows submarines to use diesel engines while submerged. Snorkels, when used by vehicles with air-breathing internal combustion engines, sometimes allow limited <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> capability for river crossing or amphibious landing operations, {{particularly in the case}} of tanks and other armored vehicles. In such cases, the snorkel supplies air for both the engine and the sealed crew compartment, allowing total submersion. Often, the snorkel pipe is of large diameter and fits over the crew hatch, to provide an escape route for the crew in case the vehicle becomes stuck or disabled while underwater.|$|E
50|$|In {{the absence}} of combat engineers, most tanks are limited to fording rivers. The typical fording depth for MBTs is {{approximately}} 1 m, being limited by {{the height of the}} engine air intake and driver's position. Modern tanks such as the Russian T-90 and the German Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 tanks can ford to a depth of 3 to 4 m when properly prepared and equipped with a snorkel to supply air for the crew and engine. Tank crews usually have a negative reaction towards <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> but it adds considerable scope for surprise and tactical flexibility in water crossing operations by opening new and unexpected avenues of attack.|$|E
50|$|All modern Soviet/Russian tanks {{since the}} 1960s (such as the T-55, T-72, T-90) are {{also able to}} perform <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> operations. However, unlike NATO tanks, Russian tank snorkels are {{generally}} {{only a few inches}} in diameter, and do not provide a crew escape path. This is considered a worthwhile tradeoff, since the snorkel tubing can easily be carried on the tank itself and erected in a few minutes, rather than requiring logistics vehicles to bring the snorkels up to the crossing area. However, a crew in a stuck or broken down tank is forced to wait underwater until a cable can be attached and the tank pulled from the water; this makes water crossing quite unpopular with crews, and larger NATO-type snorkels are often used while on exercises, for safety reasons.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by the scandal, humorist Corey Ford {{published}} a parody on the Lowell's book that was titled Salt water taffy; or, Twenty thousand leagues {{away from the}} sea; the almost incredible autobiography of Capt. Ezra Triplett's seafaring daughter, by June Triplett, which also became a best-seller. In his book, Ford inflates the most grotesque details of The Cradle of the Deep, thus demonstrating the fraudulent nature of the [...] "autobiography". In chapter 6 of Salt Water Taffy that mimics chapter 11 of The Cradle of the <b>Deep,</b> <b>Ford</b> ridicules Lowell's devotion to maritime omens which allegedly preceded Star of Bengals last voyage and the portrayal of her father as an infallible captain.|$|R
50|$|The first, {{second and}} sixth road wheel {{stations}} are fitted with hydraulic shock absorbers. The tank can negotiate a gradient of 320 and side slope of 250. Equally, the tank can ford a water depth of 5m using <b>deep</b> water <b>fording</b> equipment.|$|R
25|$|The Sabine River was too <b>deep</b> to <b>ford,</b> {{and proved}} to be navigable. Early {{travelers}} and settlers would have to swim the river on horseback and cattle {{would have to be}} driven into the river to swim across. Ferries were later put into service. By the 1840s steamboats were traveling from Logansport to Sabine Lake.|$|R
50|$|Most modern tanks {{since the}} 1960s {{are able to}} perform <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> operations, not only to allow heavy main battle tanks to cross rivers even {{when there are no}} bridges strong enough to support them, but also to avoid {{bottlenecks}} and tough defensive positions at bridges, or to continue the attack even if the bridge is destroyed. In NATO and Soviet tanks especially, {{this is due to the}} Cold War emphasis on European warfare, which requires the crossing of numerous rivers. For example, the Leopard 2 tank carries a snorkel that is in fact a series of rings which can be stacked to create a long tube. This tube is then fitted to the crew commander's hatch and provides air and an escape route for the crew. The height of the tube is limited to around three meters. It is common NATO practice to provide a tube large enough to double as an escape route, although a more common approach is fit a single long, wide tube over the crew hatch on the turret. This allows an escape route for the crew, but must be carried to the front separately, as they are too big and bulky to easily carry on top of the tank.|$|E
50|$|The Germans {{gave their}} Tiger tank a long snorkel, {{essentially}} a long tube on the commander's hatch that {{allowed it to}} wade through up to four metres of water, as well as rubber gaskets on all openings. This was necessary {{due to the fact}} that the large tank was too heavy for most bridges in Europe and Russia at the time, meaning that they had to be able to deep ford across rivers when a bridge wasn't available. The Tiger was the first tank to come with <b>deep</b> <b>fording</b> ability as designed, although the earlier Tauchpanzer, a modification of the Panzer III and Panzer IV, was designed to drive on the sea-bed, part of the German preparations for Operation Sea Lion, the planned invasion of Britain in 1941. A long, flexible rubber hose with a floating buoy on the end supplied the engine and crew with air and gave the waterproofed tank a maximum diving depth of 15 m making it an extreme example of a wading tank. They were also extremely unpopular with their crew, due to the danger of breakdown while in deep water and the possibility of drowning. Since the crew was unable to see where they were going, direction was given was by means of radio and a spotter on the surface. The Germans eventually converted 168 Panzer IIIs and 42 Panzer IVs into Tauchpanzers, although they were never used for their intended purpose in the end.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Marilao River {{was fought}} on March 27, 1899, in Marilao, Bulacan, Philippines, during the Philippine–American War. It {{was one of}} the most celebrated river {{crossings}} of the whole war, wherein American forces crossed the Marilao River, which was 80 yards wide and too <b>deep</b> to <b>ford,</b> while under Filipino fire from the opposite bank.|$|R

60|$|Makoma {{travelled}} far {{towards the}} west; over rough mountains and water-logged morasses, <b>fording</b> <b>deep</b> rivers, and tramping for days across dry deserts where most men would have died, until at length {{he arrived at}} a hut standing near some large peaks, and inside the hut were two beautiful women.|$|R
50|$|In 1975, the M60A1(RISE) meaning Reliability Improved Selected Equipment was introduced. Its AVDS-1790-2C {{diesel engine}} {{featured}} several changes {{in order to}} improve service life and reliability: new top-loading air cleaners; stronger cylinders; improved starter, fuel injection lines, and nozzles; and better turbosuperchargers. A new 650 ampere oil cooled alternator, a solid state regulator and new wiring harness with more accessible disconnect were also incorporated into its electrical system. The M60A1(RISE)(PASSIVE), which debuted in 1977, featured passive night vision sights for gunner and commander, a new night vision device for the driver and a <b>deep</b> water <b>fording</b> kit.|$|R

50|$|During the Edo period, the Tōkaidō (road) {{developed}} {{as the major}} highway linking Edo with Kyoto, and daimyo from the western domains were forced to travel {{on a regular basis}} to Edo to attend to the shogun in a system known as sankin-kōtai. However, the Tokugawa shogunate prohibited the building of bridges over major rivers as a security measure. As depicted in contemporary ukiyo-e prints by artists such as Hokusai, travelers crossed the river on ferryboats, as the current was too fast and too <b>deep</b> for <b>fording.</b> In cases of bad weather or high waters, they were forced to stay several days (or even several weeks) beside the river at post stations (shukuba) such as Mitsuke-juku.|$|R
50|$|From the 1840s {{through the}} 1860s {{hundreds}} of thousands of emigrants made their way west along the Oregon, California and Mormon emigration trails. Nearly all of the primary emigration routes had to cross the Green River at some point. The main trail crossed near where the Big Sandy River joins the Green River in Wyoming. The river is too big and <b>deep</b> to <b>ford,</b> and is the largest, most dangerous river crossed by the Oregon Trail. For that reason, ferries were commonly run on this stretch of the river. Some of the popular ferries included the Lombard and Robinson ferries at the main crossing, and the Mormon, Mountain Man, and Names Hill ferries where the popular Sublette-Greenwood cutoff crossed the river further upstream.|$|R
5|$|During the 19th century, Lees Ferry {{served as}} a gateway for the {{expansion}} of white settlement from Utah south into Arizona. Most of the settlers were Mormons, who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present-day Salt Lake City, and were looking for additional land. Although the river at Lee's Ferry is too <b>deep</b> to <b>ford</b> for most of the year, its relatively calm current presented an attractive site for crossing by boat. Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864, and during the next few years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost (Fort Meeks) in order to defend against Navajo raids. However, these works eventually fell into disrepair as a result {{of not being able to}} sustain themselves in the valley.|$|R
