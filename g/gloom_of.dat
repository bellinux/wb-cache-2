25|$|This is {{the first}} of the Poirot novels to reflect the {{pervasive}} <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War, and is one of Christie's most overtly political novels. Frank Carter is a fascist and Howard Raikes a leftist. Blunt's credentials as a champion of conservative reaction are made obvious throughout the text. Nevertheless, given the choice between setting free a murderer and expediently allowing an unpleasant but innocent man go to the gallows, Poirot (with marked reluctance) saves Carter.|$|E

500|$|Commerce {{from the}} Columbian Exposition had helped shield Chicago from the <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> the {{economic}} Panic of 1893, which enveloped {{much of the}} rest of the nation, but after the exposition closed, the winter of 1893–94 saw much unemployment, suffering and starvation. As Irish immigrants were disproportionately employed as laborers, and had less education than other ethnic groups, Bridgeport was hit especially hard by the depression, and this was reflected in the columns. Dunne's anger especially focused on George Pullman, whose wage cuts for his workers (while not cutting the rents of their houses, which his company owned) helped provoke the Pullman Strike of 1894. In his column of August 25, Dunne wrote, ...|$|E

Berger noticed a similar {{contrast between the}} song's [...] "pop verses" [...] and [...] "the <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> a twisty, malignant chorus". For Abbott, this four-chord chorus [...] "approaches exuberance" [...] in its mixture of catchy melody and grunge. The penultimate track, [...] "T and T", was described by Bryant as an instrumental introduction leading into [...] "Huffer". Kelley Deal has stated that these two songs share a thematic union: the latter is about the negative side of inhaling paint or other substances, while the former stands for [...] "Toil and Trouble", also about the hardships that inhaling chemicals can cause.

500|$|Jamie Milton of DIY {{felt that}} the album needed [...] "another breakneck force shock to the system" [...] similar to [...] "Ful Stop", and that it {{contained}} some unnecessary elements, such as the [...] "over-tinkering echo" [...] of [...] "Present Tense" [...] and the [...] "jagged closing section" [...] of [...] "Decks Dark". Nonetheless, Milton concluded that [...] "every inch of this record has been meticulously crafted, tailor-made to fit the strengths of every member.

500|$|Overnight figures {{indicated}} that the episode averaged 8.7million viewers and a 37% audience share. Official figures gave the episode ratings of 8.86million for its original airing and 740,000 for its 10pm repeat on BBC Three. Brown's performance in the episode was praised by Robert Hanks of The Independent who wrote: [...] "I don't ever remember hearing anybody on a soap talk like this before. I mean, like a real person, with real feelings, such as self-pity and a desperate urge for self-preservation. Brown conveyed the seedy <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> it all beautifully, as well." [...] Nancy Banks-Smith of The Guardian deemed Brown possibly {{the only member of}} the cast, with the exception of Barbara Windsor (Peggy Mitchell), capable of carrying such a monologue, opining that she [...] "carried it off magnificently". She took issue with Dot's characterisation, however, believing that Dot is presented as the serial's [...] "moral compass", and would not leave her husband in a nursing home.|$|E

Other pieces from this period include a draft of a play about a bishop, a monk, and a woman accused of paganism by local shepherds, as well as love-poems and narrative lyrics on German knights. The early works were both conventional and, according to the critic Charles Johnston, [...] "utterly unIrish", seeming {{to come out of}} a [...] "vast murmurous <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> dreams". Although Yeats's early works drew heavily on Shelley, Edmund Spenser, and on the diction and colouring of pre-Raphaelite verse, he soon turned to Irish mythology and folklore and the writings of William Blake. In later life, Yeats paid tribute to Blake by describing him as one of the [...] "great artificers of God who uttered great truths to a little clan". In 1891, Yeats published John Sherman and [...] "Dhoya", one a novella, the other a story.|$|E

Or even necessary?" [...] Teeman opined that: [...] "Quite rightly, the producers want to eke as much gold out of the character and actress as possible: both are fantastic.

500|$|The cantata {{opens with}} [...] "" [...] (Abide with us; {{for it is}} toward evening), a {{large-scale}} tripartite chorus, reminiscent of a slow sarabande or of the closing Ruht wohl, ihr heiligen Gebeine of the St John Passion. The instruments, a choir of three oboes and strings, present a theme which Dürr describes as [...] "of speech-like gestures". It is {{picked up by the}} voices, first in homophony. The vocal lines in this movement descend on [...] "" [...] (for evening is nigh) [...] "as if the <b>gloom</b> <b>of</b> night were weighing upon them". While the beginning of the movement has no tempo marking, the middle section is marked Andante and in Alla-breve time, suggesting a faster pace. The voices, accompanied first only by the continuo, perform a fugue on two subjects at the same time: [...] "denn es will Abend werden" [...] (for it is toward evening) and [...] "und der Tag hat sich geneiget" [...] (and the day is far spent). A third motif, long notes on the same pitch, illustrates the [...] "abiding" [...] or staying. The movement is closed by a shortened reprise of the beginning. The Bach scholar Klaus Hofmann compares the slow-fast-slow structure of the movement to the French overture and notes that it opens a new series of cantatas. John Eliot Gardiner, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes the similarity to the last chorus Ruht wohl from Bach's St John Passion, describing the cantata's [...] "tender pleadings which become ever more gestural and urgent for enlightenment in a darkening world from which Jesus' presence has been removed." ...|$|E

[...] Like Richardson, Mackenzie concludes that the tragedy in the play arises from Hamlet's nature: even the best qualities of his character merely reinforce his inability to cope with the world in which he is placed. To this analysis Thomas Robertson adds in particular the devastating impact of the death of Hamlet's father.|$|E
