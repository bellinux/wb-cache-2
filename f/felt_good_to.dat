500|$|Madonna {{had never}} {{performed}} [...] "Take a Bow" [...] {{on any of}} her concert tours until February 4, 2016, when she performed the song during the Taipei stop of her Rebel Heart Tour. After the performance, she exclaimed [...] "That was fun! First time ever. Hit a few bad notes, but it <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> sing it." [...] The singer subsequently performed the song in the other cities during the Asian and Oceanian legs of the Rebel Heart Tour. An acoustic version of [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was performed on Madonna's one-off concert in Sydney, [...] The show started with Madonna appearing onstage, in a clown's costume consisting of a billowing dress, pink and yellow stalkings, riding a tricycle and circled round it.|$|E
500|$|This episode reintroduces and {{resolves}} Veronica's rape, introduced {{earlier in}} the season. However, it had been largely ignored until {{this point in the}} series. The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega, after [...] "Drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] and [...] "Mars vs. Mars". In addition, the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero's sixth writing credit for the show. After the episode aired, Rob Thomas called the episode [...] "our high-water mark". Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode, he stated, [...] "She was really my right hand writing the series, and it <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have someone who knew the voices as well as I did. We were both in a comfort zone, both writing this show and writing with each other." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Commander" [...] is an electro-house-R song, set in {{a common}} time {{signature}} of 125beats per minute. It was written by Kelly Rowland, Rico Love, David Guetta and Sandy Vee with deliberate grammar errors such as [...] "there's no other who do it like I do it" [...] and [...] "you won't find no lady who does it like I does it". The lyrics have themes around hair, fashion and competing with other women. Guetta also produced the synthesized dance beats, {{which is similar to}} his other production, [...] "Sexy Bitch". The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hip-hop producer Timbaland. Rowland explained that the hook of the song, [...] "Commander", should be associated with dance instead of the military. [...] "When I command you to dance ... I want you moving, you know? It <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have a song that I could express that in." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Our {{producer}} Erik Ron {{will always}} start an album by asking me 'what {{are you feeling}} right now?" [...] to which I replied 'pissed off.' I think anyone that has suffered through loss, betrayal, insecurity and abandonment will absolutely relate to it. For me, it <b>felt</b> so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> get everything I had been bottling up out and hopefully it helps others in the process." ...|$|R

I was freed entirely, and it <b>felt</b> so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> have {{the use of}} all my limbs once more that I pranced round in a rather lively way. Either my antics annoyed Herky-Jerky or he thought it a <b>good</b> {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> show his skill with a lasso, for he shot the loop over me so hard that it stung my back.|$|R
500|$|John Tobias {{said that}} his inspirations for the game's story and {{characters}} came from the Chinese mythology {{and some of the}} stories and rumored events about the Shaolin monks. Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. A few years ago I [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> get that out of my system." ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Liedtke and George Avalos of the Contra Costa Times {{were pleased}} with the episode and wrote, [...] "The latest episode also {{contained}} many {{of the elements of}} a classic mythology episode. The stakes were huge and the heroes faced the greatest of hazards. The use of the oil rig created a sense of isolation for Mulder and Doggett, and the paranoia levels were sky-high. We still can't figure out why we haven't seen more episodes along the lines of Vienen during the past three seasons." [...] Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B–". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, [...] "after watching 'Vienen', I can honestly say that for once of the few times this season, it <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> be an X-Files fan again". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the [...] "fourth season version" [...] of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.|$|E
500|$|One of Lex's key {{characteristics}} is his curiosity for the unexplained. Lex's primary motive for his [...] "shady" [...] actions derives from his curiosity, specifically beginning {{from the moment}} he and Clark meet after Lex hits Clark with his Porsche. Clark always appearing when something strange happens in Smallville does nothing but fuel Lex's curiosity. Rosenbaum believes that Lex's only sees two options: [...] "For Lex, it's either take a nice ride to Metropolis and work with his dad, or find out what's going on with this strong, strange fellow, Clark Kent." [...] Another characteristic of Smallville 's Lex Luthor—one that is being developed {{over the course of the}} series—is his evilness. Rosenbaum believes that what the audience sees in Lex's dark side in the early seasons is merely a taste of what the character is truly capable of. In the season two premiere [...] "Vortex", Rosenbaum requested Greg Beeman to shoot a close-up of him after he shoots Nixon, in an effort to open a window into Lex's darker side. Rosenbaum intended to leave the interpretation of whether Lex enjoyed killing Nixon open to the audience. As Beeman explains Rosenbaum's thoughts, [...] "...either Lex is horrified and appalled, or he liked it, and it <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> him". According to Rosenbaum, when Lex reaches that point where he uses all of his mind, and [...] "really flips out", that is the point where the [...] "world needs to hide". Television reviewer Brian Byun felt that it was this struggle between good and evil inside Lex that not only made him an anti-hero, but also, given that the audience familiar with Lex's mythology and the knowledge that he will end up being Superman's greatest enemy, make Smallvilles Lex Luthor a [...] "tragic figure [...] almost Shakespearean grandeur".|$|E
5000|$|The song almost didn't {{make it on}} the album, due to its rhythmic {{similarities}} to [...] "Everybody Hurts." [...] Yet Michael Stipe's melody, the band <b>felt,</b> was too <b>good</b> <b>to</b> pass over, so the original rhythm was slightly reworked.|$|R

2500|$|Bret {{tried to}} make amends with Owen, teaming {{with him on a}} regular basis. Bret even secured the two a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship. They faced the Quebecers for the title at the Royal Rumble in January 1994. Initially {{everything}} was fine between the brothers, but when Bret hurt his knee (kayfabe) and was unable to tag Owen in {{for a long period of}} time, the younger Hart got frustrated. When the referee stopped the match due to Bret's damaged knee, Owen snapped; he kicked his brother in the knee and then walked off, berating Bret on the Titantron shortly after as Bret was being helped backstage. This started his run as a heel. After the act, an infuriated Owen accused his brother of being selfish and holding him down. Owen admitted that it <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> take out his brother. The two brothers faced off for the first time at WrestleMania X, where Owen cleanly pinned his older brother. Later in the evening, Bret won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship while Owen stood by and watched in jealousy as Bret celebrated in the ring. Owen won the King of the Ring tournament with Jim Neidhart's help. After the victory, Owen took the nickname [...] "The King of Harts." ...|$|E

60|$|One afternoon, {{with the}} sky full {{of white and}} black rolling clouds and a cold wind {{sweeping}} through the cedars, she halted to rest and escape the chilling gale for a while. In a sunny place, under the lee of a gravel bank, she sought refuge. It was warm here because of the reflected sunlight {{and the absence of}} wind. The sand {{at the bottom of the}} bank held a heat that <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> <b>to</b> her cold hands. All about her and over her swept the keen wind, rustling the sage, seeping the sand, swishing the cedars, but she was out of it, protected and insulated. The sky above showed blue between the threatening clouds. There were no birds or living creatures in sight. Certainly the place had little of color or beauty or grace, nor could she see beyond a few rods. Lying there, without any particular reason that she was conscious of, she suddenly felt shot through and through with exhilaration.|$|E

Ron Copeland, the Little Grill visionary and now Mennonite Preacher (sic), was thrilled, and it <b>felt</b> so <b>good</b> <b>to</b> give back to him, because he gave us so much.

60|$|Yes; it is so. Without any {{colouring}} of romance, or any exaggeration of fancy, it is so.

Whatever trials follow, whatever pains of sickness or shades of death, the glory precedent still shines through, cheering the keen anguish, and tinging the deep cloud.|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the longitudinality attribute in childcare provided through the Family Health Strategy. Method: quantitative survey performed with 344 caregivers of children below 10 years old, registered in the family health strategy of Distrito Sanitario III in João Pessoa, Paraiba. Data were collected from July to December, 2012, from the Brazil PCATool child version form and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: among the aspects evaluated, it is highlighted that 89. 5 % of caregivers said they were consulted by the same professionals, and 81. 9 % <b>felt</b> <b>good</b> talking <b>to</b> the professional. The average score for the longitudinality component was satisfactory, with a 6. 6 value. Conclusion: the health facilities assessed are guided towards the longitudinality attribute, however, the target mean score was exactly the cutoff value, implying {{the need for a}} thoughtful look at the improvement of the attribute in the care of children under ten years...|$|R
