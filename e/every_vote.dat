(Koza had previously had exposure to interstate compacts from his work with state lottery commissions after inventing the scratch-off lottery ticket.) That year, Koza, Barry Fadem and others formed National Popular Vote, a non-profit group to promote the legislation. The group has a transpartisan advisory committee including former US Senators Jake Garn, Birch Bayh, and David Durenberger, and former Representatives John Anderson, John Buchanan, and Tom Campbell.|$|E

On February 18, 2005, Senator Boxer and colleges introduced the Count <b>Every</b> <b>Vote</b> Act of 2005, which would provide a voter verified paper ballot for <b>every</b> <b>vote</b> cast in electronic voting machines and ensure access to voter verification for all citizens. The bill mandates that this ballot be the official ballot for purposes of a recount. The bill sets a uniform standard for provisional ballots and requires the Federal Election Assistance Commission to issue standards that ensure uniform access to voting machines and trained election personnel in every community. The bill also mandated improved security measures for electronic voting machines. The bill did not pass.|$|E
25|$|On the March 8, 2007 results show, Ryan Seacrest {{announced}} an initiative {{to give back}} to people in poverty in both Africa and the United States (including those affected by Hurricane Katrina). The event took place over two episodes of the series. For <b>every</b> <b>vote</b> cast immediately following the April 24, 2007 broadcast, many sponsors donated funds to the Charity Projects Entertainment Fund. The fund will distribute the money raised to many charities in the US as well as in Africa. News Corporation pledged to donate 10 cents for <b>every</b> <b>vote</b> made to the show for the first 50 million calls, that is, up to $5 million. MySpace created a special profile page for the event in order to spread the word. Donations from viewers were accepted by phone and website during the April 25, 2007 results show, {{in a manner similar to}} a telethon. Near the end of the broadcast, Seacrest announced the show raised 30 million US dollars, with the final tally coming on May 1, 2007. As of May 1, 2007, over $70 million has been raised as a result of Idol Gives Back.|$|E

Harrington's proposal for an immediate cease fire and an immediate withdrawal of U.S. forces was defeated.

500|$|A joint {{resolution}} {{to amend the}} Constitution, providing for the popular election {{of the president and}} vice president under a new electoral system was introduced in 2005 by Representative Gene Green of Texas. In 2009, at the start of the 111th Congress, Green introduced , commonly known as the <b>Every</b> <b>Vote</b> Counts Amendment. Two other {{joint resolution}}s were proposed in the 111th Congress to amend the Constitution to establish a national popular vote for the president and vice-president. Sponsored by Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. of Illinois, [...] would require a majority vote for president. Sponsored by Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, [...] would leave the method of election to an Act of Congress. Each of these measures died in committee.|$|E
500|$|It is {{possible}} that Congress would have to approve the NPVIC before it could go into effect. Article I, Section 10 of the US Constitution states that: [...] "No State shall, without the Consent of Congress ... enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power." [...] However, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in Virginia v. Tennessee, , and in several more recent cases, that such consent is not necessary except where a compact encroaches on federal supremacy. <b>Every</b> <b>Vote</b> Equal argues that the compact could never encroach upon federal power since the Constitution explicitly gives the power of casting electoral votes to the states, not the federal government. Derek Muller argues that the NPVIC would nonetheless affect the federal system {{in such a way}} that it would require Congressional approval, while Ian Drake argues that Congress is actually prohibited under the Constitution from granting approval to the NPVIC. NPVIC supporters dispute this conclusion and state they plan to seek congressional approval if the compact is approved by a sufficient number of states.|$|E
500|$|When it {{was time}} to call a vote, the {{presiding}} magistrate could bring up whatever proposals (in whatever order) he wished, and <b>every</b> <b>vote</b> was between a proposal and its negative. Quorums were required for votes to be held, and it is known that in 67 BC the size of a quorum was set at 200 senators (by the lex Cornelia de privilegiis). At any point before a motion passed, the proposed motion could be vetoed. Usually, vetoes were handed down by plebeian tribunes. If the Senate proposed a bill that the plebeian tribune (the magistrate who was the chief representative of the people) did not agree with, he issued a veto, which was backed by the promise to literally [...] "'interpose the sacrosanctity of his person'" [...] (or intercessio) if the Senate did not comply. If the Senate did not comply, he could physically prevent the Senate from acting, and any resistance could be criminally prosecuted as constituting a violation of his sacrosanctity. If the vetoed motion was proposed the next day, and the plebeian tribune who had vetoed it the day before was not present to interpose himself, the motion could be passed. In general, the plebeian tribune had to physically be present at the Senate meeting, otherwise his physical threat of interposing his person had no meaning. Ultimately, the plebeian tribune's veto was based in a promise of physical force.|$|E

40|$|The Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem is a {{well-known}} theorem {{from the field of}} social choice theory. It states that <b>every</b> <b>voting</b> scheme with at least 3 possible outcomes is dictatorial or manipulable.

We show how the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem can be derived from the seemingly less general formulation. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth of}} Internet {{commerce}} has stimulated {{the use of}} collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms as recommender systems. A collaborative filtering (CF) algorithm recommends items {{of interest to the}} target user by leveraging the votes given by other similar users. In a standard CF framework, it is assumed that the credibility of <b>every</b> <b>voting</b> user is exactly the same with respect to the target user. This assumption is not satisfied and thus may lead to misleading recommendations in many practical applications. A natural countermeasure is to design a trust-aware CF (TaCF) algorithm, which can take account of the difference in the credibilities of the voting users when performing CF. To this end, this paper presents a trust inference approach, which can predict the implicit trust of the target user on <b>every</b> <b>voting</b> user from a sparse explicit trust matrix. Then an improved CF algorithm termed iTrace is proposed, which takes advantage of both the explicit and the predicted implicit trust to provide recommendations with the CF framework. An empirical evaluation on a public dataset demonstrates that the proposed algorithm provides a significant improvement in recommendation quality in terms of mean absolute error (MAE).
