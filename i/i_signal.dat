40|$|Many pathogens, {{including}} viruses, bacteria, and protozoan parasites, suppress cellular immune responses through {{activation of}} type <b>I</b> IFN <b>signaling.</b> Recent {{evidence suggests that}} immune suppression and susceptibility to the malaria parasite, Plasmodium, is mediated by type I IFN; however, {{it is unclear how}} type I IFN suppresses immunity to blood-stage Plasmodium parasites. During experimental severe malaria, CD 4 (+) Th cell responses are suppressed, and conventional DC (cDC) function is curtailed through unknown mechanisms. Here, we tested the hypothesis that type <b>I</b> IFN <b>signaling</b> directly impairs cDC function during Plasmodium infection in mice. Using cDC-specific IFNAR 1 -deficient mice, and mixed BM chimeras, we found that type <b>I</b> TEN <b>signaling</b> directly affects cDC function, limiting the ability of cDCs to prime IFN-gamma-producing Th 1 cells. Although type <b>I</b> IFN <b>signaling</b> modulated all subsets of splenic cDCs, CD 8 (-) cDCs were especially susceptible, exhibiting reduced phagocytic and Th 1 -promoting properties in response to type I IFNs. Additionally, rapid and systemic IFN-alpha production in response to Plasmodium infection required type <b>I</b> IFN <b>signaling</b> in cDCs themselves, revealing their contribution to a feed-forward cytokine-signaling loop. Together, these data suggest abrogation of type <b>I</b> IFN <b>signaling</b> in CD 8 - splenic cDCs as an approach for enhancing Th 1 responses against Plasmodium and other type I IFN-inducing pathogens...|$|R

Multiply scattered light contributes to the Class <b>I</b> <b>signal</b> as well as the Class II signal. The average number of scattering events increases linearly with the probing depth.

40|$|Across evolution, type <b>I</b> <b>signal</b> peptidases are {{responsible}} for the cleavage of secretory signal peptides from proteins following their translocation across membranes. In Archaea, type <b>I</b> <b>signal</b> peptidases combine domain-specific features with traits found in either their eukaryal or bacterial counterparts. Eukaryal and bacterial type <b>I</b> <b>signal</b> peptidases differ in terms of catalytic mechanism, pharmacological profile, and oligomeric status. In this study, genes encoding Sec 11 a and Sec 11 b, two type <b>I</b> <b>signal</b> peptidases of the halophilic archaeon Haloferax volcanii, were cloned. Although both genes are expressed in cells grown in rich medium, gene deletion approaches suggest that Sec 11 b, but not Sec 11 a, is essential. For purification purposes, tagged versions of the protein products of both genes were expressed in transformed Haloferax volcanii, with Sec 11 a and Sec 11 b being fused to a cellulose-binding domain capable of interaction with cellulose in hypersaline surroundings. By employing an in vitro signal peptidase assay designed for use with high salt concentrations such as those encountered by halophilic archaea such as Haloferax volcanii, the signal peptide-cleaving activities of both isolated membranes and purified Sec 11 a and Sec 11 b were addressed. The results show that the two enzymes differentially cleave the assay substrate, raising the possibility that the Sec 11 a and Sec 11 b serve distinct physiological functions.
