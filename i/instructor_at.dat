40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the use of}} adult learning principles by <b>instructors</b> <b>at</b> two state-run multi-jurisdictional police training academies using Problem-Based Learning (PBL). Instructor use of adult learning principles was assessed using an electronic version of the Principles of Adult Learning Scale (PALS). PALS scores indicate that <b>instructors</b> <b>at</b> both institutions favor an instructor-centered as opposed to student-centered teaching style, that time since PBL implementation {{did not lead to}} a greater use of adult learning principles by <b>instructors</b> <b>at</b> the academy utilizing PBL for a greater length of time, and that there is little significant difference in the use of adult learning principles by <b>instructors</b> <b>at</b> the two PBL academies compared to <b>instructors</b> <b>at</b> an academy not using PBL. The results of this study will potentially impact the training provided to police instructors both prior to and following adoption of PBL as well as the decision of some agencies to convert to PBL-based curricula...|$|R

5|$|During this period, Ueshiba {{was invited}} to teach {{at a number of}} {{military}} institutes, due to his close personal relationships with key figures in the military (among them Sadao Araki, the Japanese Minister of War). He accepted an invitation from Admiral Sankichi Takahashi to be the martial arts <b>instructor</b> <b>at</b> the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, and also taught at the Nakano Spy School, although aikido was later judged to be too technical for the students there and karate was adopted instead.
