5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose is to reduce friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae of the <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling of the <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Bristol Rovers {{denied that}} they were {{interested}} in signing Fortune-West in June 2003, before Doncaster Rovers of the Third Division signed him on a two-year contract. His first season with the club, 2003–04, saw him score 12 goals in 43 appearances as they won the Third Division championship, earning promotion to the Second Division. During this season, he formed a strike partnership with Gregg Blundell. Fortune-West suffered a knee injury caused by wear and tear to the <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> in October 2004, which resulted in him undergoing surgery, before returning to the team in March 2005. He was to be offered a new deal in April 2005 and finished the season with 7 goals in 28 appearances. The 2005–06 season was his last with Doncaster, as he was released after scoring 4 goals in 33 appearances.|$|E
40|$|The in vivo role of {{phagocytic}} {{synovial lining}} cells (SLC) was studied in acute experimental arthritis in the mouse. SLCs were selectively depleted by injecting liposomes encapsulating the drug dichloromethylene diphosphonate (CL 2 MDP, Clodronate). Optimal depletion of phagocytic lining cells occurred 7 days after CL 2 MDP liposome injection. Eliciting an immune complex-mediated arthritis in SLC-depleted <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> largely prevented inflammation if compared to control arthritic <b>knee</b> <b>joints.</b> Joint swelling and influx of inflammatory cells into the joint cavity was markedly diminished. Cartilage damage, {{in this model}} related to influx of inflammatory cells, was significantly decreased. Reduced influx of inflammatory cells (mainly polymorphonuclear neutrophils) was correlated to a decreased production of chemotactic factors as measured in washouts of arthritic joints in a two-compartment Transwell system. Interleukin- 1 -driven chemotactic factors seem to be involved. Interleukin- 1 levels were significantly lowered in SLC-depleted arthritic <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> as compared to controls. Injection of recombinant murine interleukin- 1 in SLC-depleted <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> caused less influx of inflammatory cells as compared to injection into control <b>knee</b> <b>joints.</b> A specific damage of CL 2 MDP liposome treatment to synovial blood vessels was excluded as intraarticular injection of human recombinant C 5 a in lining-depleted <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> showed similar influx of inflammatory cells if compared to human recombinant C 5 a injection in control <b>knee</b> <b>joints.</b> This study indicates that in immune complex-mediated arthritis, phagocytic lining cells regulate {{the onset of the}} inflammatory response...|$|R

5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of degenerative diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|The small {{saphenous vein}} (SSV), {{runs along the}} {{posterior}} aspect of the leg {{as far as the}} popliteal region, in the upper calf. Here it enters the popliteal space which is located between the two heads of the gastrocnemius muscle where it usually drains above the <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> in the popliteal vein or a little less often in the great saphenous vein (GSV) or other deep muscular veins of the thigh. The use of ultrasonography has allowed a number of variations to be shown at this level; when no contact is made with the popliteal vein it might be seen to drain in the GSV, at a variable level; or, it may merge with the Giacomini vein and drain in the GSV at the superior 1/3 of the thigh. It can also but rarely, drain in the vein of the semimembranosus (thigh muscle) (shown below). Usually though, it connects with a perforator vein at its middle 1/3. To check for insufficiency, the Paraná maneuver is very useful.|$|E
5|$|Each forelimb of {{the horse}} runs from the scapula or {{shoulder}} blade to the navicular bone. In between are the humerus (arm), radius (forearm), elbow joint, ulna (elbow), carpus (knee) bones and joint, large metacarpal (cannon), small metacarpal (splint), sesamoid, fetlock joint, first phalanx (long pastern), pastern joint, second phalanx (short pastern), coffin joint, outwardly evidenced by the coronary band, and the third phalanx (coffin or pedal) bones. Each hind limb {{of the horse}} runs from the pelvis to the navicular bone. After the pelvis come the femur (thigh), patella, stifle joint, tibia, fibula, tarsal (hock) bone and joint, large metatarsal (cannon) and small metatarsal (splint) bones. Below these, the arrangement of sesamoid and phalanx bones and joints {{is the same as}} in the forelimbs. When the horse is moving, the distal interphalangeal joint (coffin joint) has the highest amount of stresses applied to it of any joint in the body, and it can be significantly affected by trimming and shoeing techniques. Although having a small range of movement, the proximal interphalangeal joint (pastern joint) is also influential to the movement of the horse, and can change the way that various shoeing techniques affect tendons and ligaments in the legs. Due to the horse's development as a cursorial animal (one whose main form of defense is running), its bones evolved to facilitate speed in a forward direction over hard ground, without the need for grasping, lifting or swinging. The ulna shrank in size and its top portion became the point of the elbow, while the bottom fused with the radius above the radiocarpal (<b>knee)</b> <b>joint,</b> which corresponds to the wrist in humans. A similar change occurred in the fibula bone of the hind limbs. These changes were first seen in the genus Merychippus, approximately 17 million years ago.|$|E

30|$|According to Figure  4, it can {{be found}} that the walking speed of the {{heavy-duty}} six-legged robot depends on the hip <b>joints</b> and <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> of leg 2 and leg 5, not on their abductor joints.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{demonstrate}} {{the ability of}} a novel radiographic technique, Diffraction Enhanced Radiographic Imaging (DEI), to render high contrast images of canine <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> for identification of cartilage lesions in situ. MethodsDEI was carried out at the X- 15 A beamline at Brookhaven National Laboratory on intact canine <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> with varying levels of cartilage damage. Two independent observers graded the DE images for lesions and these grades were correlated to the gross morphological grade. ResultsThe correlation of gross visual grades with DEI grades for the 18 canine <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> as determined by observer 1 (r 2 = 0. 8856, P= 0. 001) and observer 2 (r 2 = 0. 8818, P= 0. 001) was high. The overall weighted κ value for inter-observer agreement was 0. 93, thus considered high agreement. ConclusionThe present study is the first study for the efficacy of DEI for cartilage lesions in an animal joint, from very early signs through erosion down to subchondral bone, representing the spectrum of cartilage changes occurring in human osteoarthritis (OA). Here we show that DEI allows the visualization of cartilage lesions in intact canine <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> with good accuracy.

25|$|Professor Kenji Takagi in Tokyo has {{traditionally}} been credited with performing the first arthroscopic examination of a <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> in 1919.

He called the procedure (in Latin) arthroscopia genu, and used sterile saline or boric acid solution as his optic media, and entering the joint by a portal on the outer border of the patella. It is not clear if these examinations were of deceased or of living patients.|$|E
25|$|The {{bioreactor}} {{must have}} similar properties to a <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> {{so that when}} the ACL is inserted into the body, it is not rejected as foreign, which could cause infection.

25|$|Usually, {{the large}} joints {{of the lower}} limb are aligned in a {{straight}} line, which represents the mechanical longitudinal axis of the leg, the Mikulicz line. This line stretches from the hip joint (or more precisely {{the head of the}} femur), through the <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> (the intercondylar eminence of the tibia), and down {{to the center of the}} ankle (the ankle mortise, the fork-like grip between the medial and lateral malleoli). In the tibial shaft, the mechanical and anatomical axes coincide, but in the femoral shaft they diverge 6°, resulting in the femorotibial angle of 174° in a leg with normal axial alignment. A leg is considered straight when, with the feet brought together, both the medial malleoli of the ankle and the medial condyles of the knee are touching. Divergence from the normal femorotibial angle is called genu varum if the center of the <b>knee</b> <b>joint</b> is lateral to the mechanical axis (intermalleolar distance exceeds 3cm), and genu valgum if it is medial to the mechanical axis (intercondylar distance exceeds 5cm). These conditions impose unbalanced loads on the joints and stretching of either the thigh's adductors and abductors.|$|E

40|$|Psoriatic {{arthritis}} (PsA) is an arthropathy {{associated to}} psoriasis, {{which is part}} of the spondyloarthropathy family, and which may present with various forms, from mono-oligoarthritis to symmetric polyarthritis mimicking rheumatoid arthritis. In longstanding disease, the symmetric polyarthritis is the most common pattern of PsA, involving small joint of hands, feet, wrists, ankles and, very frequently, knees. Other common features are represented by the inflammation of enthesis and tendons. Ultrasound (US) examinations were performed using a Logiq 9 (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI) equipped with a multifrequency linear probe, working at 10 - 14 MHz.

25|$|Evolution has {{provided}} the human body with two distinct features: the specialization of the upper limb for visually guided manipulation and the lower limb's development into a mechanism specifically adapted for efficient bipedal gait. While the capacity to walk upright {{is not unique to}} humans, other primates can only achieve this for short periods and at a great expenditure of energy. The human adaption to bipedalism {{is not limited to the}} leg, however, but has also affected the location of the body's center of gravity, the reorganisation of internal organs, and the form and biomechanism of the trunk. In humans, the double S-shaped vertebral column acts as a shock-absorber which shifts the weight from the trunk over the load-bearing surface of the feet. The human legs are exceptionally long and powerful as a result of their exclusive specialization to support and locomotion— in orangutans the leg length is 111% of the trunk; in chimpanzees 128%, and in humans 171%. Many of the leg's muscles are also adapted to bipedalism, most substantially the gluteal muscles, the extensors of the <b>knee</b> <b>joint,</b> and the calf muscles.|$|E
40|$|By {{performing}} repeated sit-stand-sit {{movements to}} create stress on <b>knee</b> <b>joints,</b> short transient bursts of high frequency acoustic emission (AE) {{released by the}} <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> were acquired from two age matched groups consisting of healthy and osteoarthritic (OA) knees, and significant differences between these two groups were discovered from the signal analysis performed. The analysis {{is based on a}} four-phase model of sit-stand-sit movements and a two-feature descriptor of AE bursts. The four phases are derived from joint angle measurement during movement, and they consist of the ascending-acceleration and ascending-deceleration phases in the sit-to-stand movement, followed by the descendingacceleration and descending-deceleration phases in the stand-to-sit movement. The two features are extracted from AE measurement during movement, and they consist of the peak magnitude value and average signal level of each AE burst. The proposed analysis method is shown to provide a high sensitivity for differentiation of the two age matched healthy and OA groups, with the most significant difference found to come from the peak magnitude value in the ascendingdeceleration phase, clear quantity and strength differences in the image based visual display of their AE feature profiles due to substantially more AE bursts from OA <b>knee</b> <b>joints</b> with higher peak magnitude values and higher average signal levels, and two well separated clusters in the space formed by the principal components.

The unstiffened welded joints were not able to reach the plastic moment. The use of an internal sleeve moved the plastic hinge in the connection away from the connection centre-line and reduced the stress on the weld between the legs of the connection.
