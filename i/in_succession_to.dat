5|$|On 1 September 1937, Newall was {{appointed}} as Chief of the Air Staff, the military {{head of the}} RAF, <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> Sir Edward Ellington. The promotion was unexpected; of the prospective candidates mooted for the job, Newall has been widely seen by historians as the least gifted. The most prominent candidate was Hugh Dowding, the head of RAF Fighter Command and senior in rank to Newall by three months, who had been informally told by Ellington in 1936 that {{he was expected to}} be appointed as the new Chief of the Air Staff. The decision was taken by the Air Minister, Viscount Swinton, without consulting Ellington for advice.|$|E

5|$|Blois was {{frequently}} {{a witness to}} Puiset's charters, and was named as rector of a parish church {{in the city of}} Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop of Lincoln. Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese of Lincoln by 22 March 1194, probably from about 1189. He was a frequent witness to Hugh's charters in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor of Lincoln in 1197, <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> the medieval writer Walter Map. Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III. He may be the Master William of Blois who is a witness to some Scottish charters.|$|E
5|$|Jaekle {{kicked off}} to the Maryland 30-yard line where it was {{returned}} by Green for two yards. A fresh Da'Rel Scott then made his first appearance in the game. He carried the ball four times <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> advance to the Nevada 46-yard line. On third down with nine yards to go, Turner was sacked by defensive lineman Kevin Basped and the ball was knocked loose. It {{was picked up by}} Wolf Pack linebacker Brandon Marshall who then also fumbled. Maryland offensive lineman Scott Burley recovered it on the Nevada 45-yard line. The alternating changes in possession gave Maryland a first down, and Turner then connected with Darrius Heyward-Bey on an 11-yard pass for another first down. Scott rushed twice to pick up a first down at the Nevada 23-yard line. After a rush by Meggett, Turner was sacked by defensive end Dontay Moch and again fumbled. This time, Nevada recovered the ball and retained possession. Kaepernick then passed to wide receiver Mike McCoy for 38yards to the Maryland 27-yard line. Vai Taua picked up seven yards on a rush attempt, and the quarter came to an end with Maryland leading, 28–21.|$|E

5|$|To {{start the}} top of the fifth inning, Art Reinhart was put in as pitcher. Reinhart walked Combs and {{followed}} by giving up a run-scoring double to Koenig.

Hi Bell replaced Reinhart as pitcher, but {{he was not able to}} suppress the Yankees' offense. Lazzeri hit a sacrifice fly to right field, which scored Ruth and moved Meusel up to third base. Dugan then hit a weak groundball; he was thrown out at first by catcher O'Farrell, but Meusel scored and Gehrig went to second base. Bell then balked, moving Gehrig to third base. Severeid was walked, and pitcher Hoyt ended the inning by hitting into a force play at second base.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{worked with}} his wife for many concerts, and was her piano accompanist at her recitals. In 1906, at the Norwich music festival he {{presented}} Beethoven's Choral Symphony and Bach's St Matthew Passion, {{with his wife}} among the singers. In December 1909, after a short illness, Olga Wood died. Cathcart took Wood away to take his mind off his loss. On his return, Wood resumed his professional routine, with the exception that, after Olga's death, he rarely performed as piano accompanist for anyone else; his skill in that art was greatly missed by the critics. In June 1911, he married his secretary, Muriel Ellen Greatrex (1882–1967), {{with whom he had}} two daughters. In the same year he accepted a knighthood, and declined the conductorship of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> Mahler, as he felt it his duty to devote himself to the British public.|$|E
5|$|Following the Nevada kickoff, Turner handed off to Scott, {{who picked}} up two yards. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Turner connected with Torrey Smith on a 26-yard toss for a third-down conversion. Scott then rushed for three {{yards to the}} Nevada 49-yard line, and carried it again down the middle, this time breaking free for a 49-yard touchdown run. On the following Nevada series, Kaepernick mounted a 38-yard drive to the Maryland 34-yard line, but failed to convert on fourth and12. On the next series, Da'Rel Scott was handed the ball four times <b>in</b> <b>succession</b> <b>to</b> pick up first downs with rushes of 11, 23, 30yards and a touchdown on a two-yard run. The score and extra point gave Maryland a two-touchdown lead, 42–28. Nevada's offense returned to the field with 7:44remaining {{in the game and}} used almost three minutes in a 37-yard drive that culminated in an interception by Maryland safety Jeff Allen on the Maryland 38-yard line. After no gain on a rush by running back Morgan Green, Maryland attempted an end-around. Turner was stepped on, and the handoff was botched. The intended recipient, Heyward-Bey, dropped the ball but managed to recover it for a loss of six yards. After Nevada called a time out, Green rushed for a five-yard gain. Nevada expended its last remaining time out to stop the clock with 4:06left. Maryland punted it away on fourth down with 11yards to go.|$|E
