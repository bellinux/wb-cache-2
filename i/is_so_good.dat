500|$|At {{the end of}} the year, {{the album}} {{received}} one vote in the Village Voice Pazz & Jop music critics poll. Rob Sevier, co-founder of the label The Numero Group, and Games, a collaboration between Daniel Lopatin (Oneohtrix Point Never) and Joel Ford, named Rain in England one of their favorite albums of the year. Dean Blunt of the electronic duo Hype Williams admired the album and said, [...] "it was artistic, it was the merit. ... Part of the reason it's so interesting, {{part of the reason why}} I think this <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good,</b> it's a juxtaposition of two things that you really don't think are meant to be together." [...] Oakland, California rapper Kreayshawn said Lil B [...] "was an influence on me. I was starting to listen to his music and hanging out with him a lot when he was working on Rain in England." [...] Cloud rap duo Main Attrakionz has been compared to the style of Rain in England.|$|E
500|$|The whole {{song was}} written without that main sample; {{it was a}} last-minute thing. The song had kind {{of a lot of}} R music in it. And Kanye gave marching orders of [...] "Take out {{anything}} you want, but don't add. Just take away." [...] Like, [...] "OK." [...] And before that, we listened to the sample together and thought, [...] "Hmm, maybe there's a way to integrate this into the song." [...] So we started by getting the sample to work in the song, and then taking out as much stuff as we could, and then in the chorus reducing what was this whole musical thing, just this sort of one ugly, distorted bass note. I was thinking like Alan Vega and Suicide, that kind of noise-synth minimal vibe. So that was the idea behind the chorus: Take it from this sort of R thing and turn it into this kind of post-punk, edge thing. And the lyrics he wrote were so good and funny. It just turned into a really good record. The sample <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good.</b>|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle called it his favorite {{episode of the}} show. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote that [...] "it's nice to see [...] and Lisa getting along so well for once." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode a 5/5 rating and commented that [...] "any football fan will love this episode, but the reason why it <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> {{is the relationship between}} Homer and Lisa. The two truly are a father and daughter to one another, causing both laughter and touching emotion in the audience." [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict said [...] "Lisa the Greek" [...] is [...] "a chance for Homer and Lisa to bond under less than ideal, but always amusing, circumstances. Oddly, for a show relying on actual events like the Super Bowl to guide its plotline, it doesn't have [...] retread feeling.|$|E

A reviewer from 13th Geek was highly positive towards the track, believing that [...] "The song <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> {{that even the}} non-Japanese speaker will want to learn the lyrics and just blare out the powerful chorus along with her." [...] The reviewer also stated that the song's chorus was completely [...] "off guard" [...] {{to the rest of}} the track. CD Journals editors were positive towards the song, commending Nao'ymt for [...] "exhausting" [...] the [...] "goodness" [...] out of Amuro's vocal abilities. The 2014 Ballada version also received positive reviews from music critics. In another review with CD Journal, a reviewer complimented Amuro's vocals and the song's background piano composition; the reviewer also labelled the production as [...] "dramatic". In another positive review, staff member's at HMV felt that it was the best ballad on the compilation album.

500|$|Calvert {{dispatched}} Captain Edward Wynne and a {{group of}} Welsh colonists to Ferryland, where they landed in August 1621, and set about constructing a settlement. Wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt, hemp, flax, tar, iron, timber and hops. Wynne also praised the climate, declaring, [...] "It is better and not so cold as England," [...] and predicted that the colony would become self-sufficient after one year. Others corroborated Wynne's reports: for example, Captain Daniel Powell, who delivered a further party of settlers to Ferryland, wrote: [...] "The land on which our Governor [...] planted <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> and commodious, that for the quantity, I think there is no better in many parts of England"; but he added ominously that Ferryland was [...] "the coldest harbour in the land". Wynne and his men began work on various building projects, including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour. To protect them against marauding French warships, a recent hazard in the area, since the recent founding of New France in the interior (modern Lower Canada of the 18th and 19th centuries, Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada) along the St. Lawrence River, Calvert employed the pirate John Nutt.|$|E
500|$|Batman's Batmobile was {{an aspect}} of the {{character}} that Rocksteady had wanted to include in its other Arkham games, but were limited by technical constraints. The designers, who worked in conjunction with DC, chose to look at their earlier design from Arkham Asylum, instead of models from the history of Batman comics and media, and evolve that to meet the necessary gameplay requirements. The vehicle was designed to integrate with Batman's on-foot traversal without being a burden; Hill stated, [...] "We didn't want it to be like, 'Okay, the Batmobile <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> I'll just stay in that all the time.' or 'Batman is so powerful gliding around I won't be using the Batmobile.' There's a definite need to use both of those." [...] The world's challenges were set out on the vertical and horizontal plane of the map to discourage players from using only one form of movement, with the Batmobile providing a faster method for moving large distances over gliding. Unlike Arkham Origins, Arkham Knight does not feature a fast travel system as the designers considered traversal {{to be part of the}} game, and allowing players to skip that would detract from the experience. Buildings hit by the vehicle suffer cosmetic damage without slowing the car, as it was considered that being impeded by a collision while turning a corner would diminish the fantasy of driving the Batmobile.|$|E

[...] Both head and heart were engaged. [...] There {{is no doubt that}} the Queen found in Abdul Karim a connection with a world that was fascinatingly alien, and a confidant who would not feed her the official line." [...] Karim was placed in charge of the other Indian servants and made responsible for their accounts. Victoria praised him in her letters and journal. [...] "I am so very fond of him" [...] she wrote, [...] "He <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> & gentle & understanding all I want & is a real comfort to me." [...] She admired [...] "her personal Indian clerk & Munshi, who is an excellent, clever, truly pous & very refined gentle man, who says, 'God ordered it'... God's Orders is what they implicitly obey! Such faith as theirs & such conscientiousness set us a gt. example." [...] At Balmoral Castle, the Queen's Scottish estate, Karim was allocated the room previously occupied by John Brown, a favourite servant of the Queen's who had died in 1883. Despite the serious and dignified manner that Karim presented to the outside world, the Queen wrote that [...] "he is very friendly and cheerful with the Queen's maids and laughs and even jokes now—and invited them to come and see all his fine things offering them fruit cake to eat".|$|E
500|$|Joseph McCabe of Nerdist stated on the episode, [...] "This week’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that {{it leaves}} me {{in a state}} of pessimism. Because I can’t see any way to follow it up that gives a {{satisfying}} resolution to the story it so beautifully presents." [...] He called it [...] "one of the very finest episodes S.H.I.E.L.D. has given us, {{and one of the few}} a viewer with almost no prior knowledge of the show can fully appreciate", and praised the handling of Simmons' and Daniels' relationship, saying that Henstridge and Casey [...] "complement one another marvelously". Discussing the episode for Vox, Caroline Framke called it [...] "astonishing", praising the decision to dedicate an episode to Simmons' ordeal rather than just reveal it through flashbacks in [...] "normal" [...] episodes, as well as the efforts of Bochco, Titley, and Henstridge, and the use of the [...] "sinister" [...] on-screen hour counter. Also reviewing the episode for Den of Geek, Marc Buxton scored it 4.5 stars out 5, calling it [...] "the most experimental episode of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date, and ... it might have been the finest hour of the series so far". Buxton felt that the episode retroactively improved the earlier season three episodes, which he had called [...] "anticlimactic" [...] due to their handling of Simmons' storyline, and praised Henstridge's performance. He also positively compared the episode's villain, which he described as [...] "hard to grasp, mysterious, and ever present", to [...] "the best Steven Moffat Doctor Who villains".|$|E
500|$|Mars co-wrote [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] with Philip Lawrence and Ari Levine of The Smeezingtons. The three co-produced {{the song}} with Mark Ronson, Jeff Bhasker, and Emile Haynie. It {{was written in}} the key of D minor, with Mars's vocals range from the low note of A3 to the high note of C5. Levine {{aforementioned}} that some parts in the song are not instruments as Mars said they needed [...] "a dep-dep-dep-dep sound". Later, Levine told Mars to [...] "sing it into the microphone", where he chopped it up, and despite sounding like an instrument, the sounds are really Mars' voice. The song's composition relies mainly on a [...] "guitar-worthy groove guitar, a soaring sing-along chorus and sexual innuendo galore". It finds Mars singing a confession of a relationship that <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>good</b> that he repeats to his love [...] "Your sex takes me to paradise", a verse inspired by Halle Berry [...] "You make me feel like I've been locked out of heaven for too long/ Can I just stay here, {{spend the rest of my}} days here?" [...] he sings. During his Google Hangout on the day of the song's release, Mars was asked by a fan to name his favorite lyrics from the track. Mars picked the phrase [...] "But swimming in your water is something spiritual," [...] and said that the single's exploration of feeling and being in love fits into the [...] "sensual, sensual and sensual" [...] theme of the album.|$|E
