5|$|Hurricane Emily {{continued}} tracking northeast throughout September25 {{into the}} following day with increasing speed. By late on September25, the <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of the storm had reached 50mph (85km/h). The storm now began to undergo an extratropical transition with forward speed peaking at 65mph (100km/h), the third highest <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> ever recorded in a tropical cyclone. Interacting with a baroclinic zone, the hurricane completed its transition at 1800UTC on September26, resulting in the issuance of the final advisory on the storm.|$|E
5|$|Late on September26, shear {{began to}} relax and deep {{convection}} redeveloped around the center of circulation and the <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of the storm began to increase. Several hours later, the storm made a sudden northwest jump due to a passing shortwave trough. By this time, Kyle was just below hurricane-status, with sustained winds up to 70mph (110km/h). Continued organization led to the storm attaining hurricane intensity at 1200UTC on September27 while located about 345mi (555km) west of Bermuda. Upon attaining this intensity, the storm became embedded within an area strong, divergent, upper-level winds. Increasing in <b>forward</b> <b>motion,</b> the center of Kyle was located along the southwestern edge of the deep convection.|$|E

5|$|As {{with all}} masses, gravity pulls the rider {{and all the}} bike {{components}} toward the earth. At each tire contact patch there are ground reaction forces with both horizontal and vertical components. The vertical components mostly counteract the force of gravity, but also vary with braking and accelerating. For details, see the section on longitudinal stability below. The horizontal components, due to friction between the wheels and the ground, including rolling resistance, are in response to propulsive forces, braking forces, and turning forces. Aerodynamic forces due to the atmosphere are mostly {{in the form of}} drag, but can also be from crosswinds. At normal bicycling speeds on level ground, aerodynamic drag is the largest force resisting <b>forward</b> <b>motion.</b> At faster speed, aerodynamic drag becomes overwhelmingly the largest force resisting <b>forward</b> <b>motion.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} six hours, Urmil underwent explosive deepening {{as the main}} feeder band wrapped around the center of circulation. After the brief period of intensification, the storm reached its peak intensity with winds of 110km/h (70mph) according to both the RSMC Nadi and the JTWC, making it a high-end Category 2 cyclone on the Australian Scale. The highly favorable environment, {{in combination with the}} fast <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> of the storm, allowed Urmil to rapidly reach its peak intensity, despite wind shear reaching 35km/h (25mph). However, as quickly as the storm strengthened, it began to weaken as convection weakened. With both wind shear and <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> increasing, the cyclone quickly became disorganized. Around 0000UTC on January15, the center of circulation was devoid of shower and thunderstorm activity. About six hours later, Urmil transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was subsequently absorbed into the mid-latitude westerlies.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's <b>forward</b> <b>motion.</b> It was released rearwards from rails on the wings of the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} the southwestern {{periphery of the}} subtropical ridge, Maria turned to the north as its <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> slowed considerably. Strong vertical wind shear over the system began to relax by September14, allowing Maria to slowly restrengthen as the convection redeveloped near its center. At 1800UTC on September15, Maria reached Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale while located roughly 135mi (215km) northwest of Bermuda. Embedded within increasing atmospheric flow, the hurricane's <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> accelerated towards the northeast. At 0000UTC on September16, Maria attained its peak intensity with winds of 80mph (130km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983mbar (29.03inHg). Continuing on a northeastward course, Maria began to move over an area with cooler sea surface temperatures and higher vertical wind shear. Around 1800UTC, Maria weakened to a tropical storm and made landfall near Cape St. Mary's, Newfoundland at 1830UTC with winds of 70mph (110km/h). Shortly thereafter, the cyclone's circulation was absorbed by a frontal system over the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, on September 18.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (<b>forward</b> <b>motion),</b> the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E

It depends only on the motion unknowns and is much more accurate than previous approximations such as the (weighted) coplanarity, especially for <b>forward</b> camera <b>motions.</b> We use this error to compute tight, rigorous {{upper and lower bounds}} on the true error and to study its properties experimentally. We demonstrate that the true error has many local minima for <b>forward</b> <b>motions</b> even when the motion is large. We propose and experimentally test a second approach, which is potentially more robust than bundle adjustment. Last, we describe algorithms for >= 2 images that reconstruct from the measured 2 D affine deformations of image patches...|$|R

5|$|As {{the storm}} began to reorganize, the <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> had become {{virtually}} stationary but later began {{to increase as}} Arlene turned northeastward, beginning recurvature into the main belt of the Westerlies. Ships {{in the vicinity of}} the depression reported that it had regained gale-force winds on August8, resulting in advisories on Arlene being re-initiated around that time. Later that day, a Navy reconnaissance plane found hurricane-force winds around the center of the storm, resulting in Arlene being upgraded to a minimal hurricane a second time.|$|E

40|$|Dexterous {{manipulation}} {{refers to}} the skillful execution of object reorienting and repositioning maneuvers, especially when performed by an articulated mechanical hand. Kinematic analyses of dexterous manipulation are limited by their omission of contact forces. In this paper, Peshkin's minimum power principle [15] for quasi-static systems is used to combine force and kinematic relationships into a nonlinear mathematical program called the <b>forward</b> object <b>motion</b> problem. Given the joint velocities of the robot's hand and arm, {{the solution of the}} <b>forward</b> object <b>motion</b> problem predicts not only the velocity of the object (as done by kinematic analyses), but also the contact forces. In kinematic analyses one must guess as to the nature of all contact interactions (i. e. sliding, rolling or separating). The solution of the <b>forward</b> object <b>motion</b> problem definitively determines these interactions and the contact forces as a byproduct of determining the velocity of the manipulated object. 1...|$|R
5|$|Over the {{following}} five days, the hurricane tracked through the Greater Antilles, causing over 600 fatalities, primarily in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. By September25, Georges entered the Gulf of Mexico as a Category 2 hurricane. The storm made landfall three days later near Biloxi, Mississippi, with winds of 105mph (165km/h). Upon landfall, the hurricane's <b>forward</b> <b>motion</b> slowed to an eastward drift. Georges dissipated on October1 near the Atlantic coast of Florida.|$|E

Dark coasters are {{roller coasters}} that feature heavily themed layouts, special effects (such as animated characters, fire, smoke, and sound/lighting effects), and a dark ride portion that abruptly transitions into a roller coaster-style layout with heavily banked turns, sharp turns, steep drops, and helices. Some of these rides feature backwards motion, as well as <b>forwards</b> <b>motion,</b> and many of them have launches in place of lifts, because they are built inside structures designed specifically for the ride.
