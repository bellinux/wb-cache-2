40|$|In three {{patients}} {{with an unusual}} presentation of diabetes mellitus, the classification of their diabetes was troublesome. An adolescent male with slightly elevated blood-glucose levels {{turned out to have}} excellent glycaemic control on sulphonylurea derivatives only. When he was 40 years of age, his diabetes was finally diagnosed as 'maturity onset diabetes of the young' (MODY). A non-obese 41 -year-old man was initially diagnosed with type- 2 diabetes. Therapy with oral hypoglycaemic agents was unsuccessful and he was subsequently classified as having 'latent autoimmune diabetes of adults' (LADA) based on the presence of antibodies against <b>glutaminic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase.</b> A 29 -year-old man presented with severe ketoacidosis and was initially believed to have type- 1 diabetes. The patient himself discontinued insulin therapy and he was eventually diagnosed as having type- 2 diabetes. A careful classification may have clinical consequences. Patients with MODY 3, for example, respond to sulphonylurea derivatives. In MODY 2, treatment with diet alone is often sufficient. In patients with LADA, insulin therapy is the treatment of choice. The recognition of diabetes mellitus type 2 as the underlying illness in some patients who present with ketoacidosis means that these patients can be specifically treated for their basic problem, which is insulin resistance. For them, weight reduction is essential and metformin is the drug of choice as far as pharmacotherapy is concerned, but of course attention must also be given to cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidaemi...|$|E

40|$|The {{presence}} {{of one of}} the major targets for autoantibodies in Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, the enzyme glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase,</b> was studied in human, rat and mouse pancreatic tissue using immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical techniques. Immunoprecipitation of glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> was attempted with lysates of [35 S]-methionine-labelled rat or mouse pancreatic islets using two different glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> antisera, one mouse monoclonal antibody raised against the 65 kDa isoform of the enzyme, sera from six patients with Type 1 diabetes, one patient with stiff-man syndrome and sera from 19 non-obese diabetic mice. The same sera were used for immunoperoxidase staining of cryosections of human, rat or mouse pancreas. Using patient sera glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> was detected by immunoprecipitations from isolated rat islets but not from islets of five different mouse strains tested, including the non-obese diabetic mouse. When using the non-obese diabetic mouse sera, glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> could not be detected in either rat or mouse tissue. Immunoperoxidase staining demonstrated high levels of glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> in human and rat pancreatic islets but low levels in mouse islets. Direct measurements of enzyme activity showed glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> to be present in mouse islets at a level of about 40 % of that in rat islets, and subsequent Western blot analyses indicated that mouse islets express the 67 kDa isoform, whereas as in rat islets both the 67 and 65 kDa isoforms are present.

40|$|In four {{persons of}} one family the {{existence}} of an enzymatic defect, presumably consisting of a deficiency of glutaminase in the cells of the renal tubules, is postulated, and is implied by a reduced elimination of ammonia in the urine, by a relatively low urinary pH, and by its increased titratable acidity. The most characteristic clinical symptom is irritation of the distal part of the urinary tract, connected with numerous crystals of uric acid appearing in the urinary sediment. The elimination of uric acid is normal, or even reduced, and the level of uric acid in the blood serum is also within normal limits. After the administration of <b>glutaminic</b> <b>acid</b> elimination of ammonia is further decreased and the quantity of uric acid crystals is increased. Loading with <b>glutaminic</b> <b>acid</b> may also cause an attack of renal pain in the individual suffering from this defect but the administration of ammonium chloride does not cause any increase in ammonia production. It seems probable that the enzymatic defect is connected with the presence of antigen B in the erythrocytes and that it is inherited as a dominant autosomal feature.

40|$|SUMMARY: Diaminopimelic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> {{was found}} to be widely {{distributed}} among 58 coli-aerogenes organisms. Different strains grown and tested under standard conditions showed great variations in enzyme activity although the amount of diaminopimelic acid in the cell hydrolysates was similar. Except for a higher average activity in Aerobacter aerogenes, there was no correlation between the activity of diaminopimelic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> and the biochemical type of coliform organism. No strain was found that contained diaminopimelic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> in the absence of lysine decarboxylase. The enzyme was also found in a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa but not in Proteus vulgaris, Streptococcus faecalis or Bacillus subtilis. Acetone-dried preparations of certain strains of Escherichia coli have been found to contain an enzyme which decarboxylates natural a-s-diaminopimelic acid to CO, and lysine (Dewey & Work, 1952 a). The amount of this enzyme (diaminopimelic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase)</b> varied from one strain to another and in three strains no activity was detected.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{expand the}} {{spectrum}} of the clinical presentation of anti-glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> antibodies-related limbic encephalitis and to improve the recognition of this entity. DESIGN: Case study. SETTING: University hospital. Patient An 11 -year-old-girl with progressive mood and behavioral disorder, speech impairment, and short-term memory impairment who manifested cerebellar ataxia with nystagmus during the disease course. INTERVENTIONS: Blood and cerebrospinal fluid analysis including autoantibodies, electroencephalography, brain and spinal magnetic resonance imaging, and cognitive and neuropsychological assessment were performed. High-dose methylprednisolone sodium succinate pulses, cycles of intravenous immunoglobulins, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab as well as antipsychotics and benzodiazepine were administered. RESULTS: Diagnosis of anti-glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> antibodies-related limbic encephalitis was made. The clinical features during {{the first months of}} disease included only mood, behavioral, and memory impairment. After 5 months, despite immunotherapies, cerebellar ataxia with nystagmus appeared with brain magnetic resonance imaging evidence of cerebral atrophy. No clinical or infraclinical seizures were recorded during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> antibodies-related limbic encephalitis can present with only behavioral or neuropsychological symptoms without any epileptic disorder.

40|$|Aims: Gestational {{diabetes}} mellitus affects approximately 7 % of all pregnant women. Some {{of these women}} develop autoantibodies that are generally characteristic of Type 1 diabetes. Autoantibodies targeting glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> and tyrosine phosphatase-like protein are the most frequently reported. A recently identified autoantigen in Type 1 diabetes is zinc transporter 8. Some reports suggest that the frequency of zinc transporter 8 antibodies {{is as high as}} glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> antibodies in Type 1 diabetes and thus a good diagnostic marker for autoimmune diabetes. There are currently no reports of zinc transporter 8 antibodies in gestational diabetes. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate the frequency of zinc transporter 8 antibodies in patients at clinical onset of gestational {{diabetes mellitus}}. Methods: Subjects included in this pilot study were all diagnosed with gestational diabetes at Skåne University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, 2009 - 2010 (n = 193). Sera samples were analysed for antibodies using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturers' instructions. Results: We found that 19 / 193 patients with gestational diabetes, diagnosed in 2009 - 2010, were positive for at least one autoantibody. Glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> was the most common single autoantibody (52. 6 %; 10 / 19), followed by zinc transporter 8 (21. 1 %; 4 / 19) and tyrosine phosphatase-like protein (15. 8 %; 3 / 19). Combinations of two or more antibodies were rare (10. 5 %; 2 / 19). Conclusions: In this study, we found that zinc transporter 8 added 2. 1 % (4 / 193) of autoantibody positivity in women with gestational diabetes who were negative for glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> and tyrosine phosphatase-like protein antibodies. Glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> was still the most prevalent autoantibody in gestational diabetes, but, as zinc transporter 8 was present {{even in the absence of}} glutamic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase,</b> this autoantibody could be an important independent marker of autoimmunity in gestational diabetes. © 2012 The Authors.

30|$|Enzymes for the {{decarboxylation}} of hydroxycinnamic acids such as p-coumaric acid, {{caffeic acid}} or ferulic acid have been described. A ferulic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> {{and the corresponding}} gene, fdc, was identified from Bacillus pumilus (Zago et al. 1995). A ferulic <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> was also identified from an Enterobacter species (Gu et al. 2011 a) and a crystal structure obtained (Gu et al. 2011 b). A p-coumaric <b>acid</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> was purified from Lactobacillus plantarum. The enzyme was inducible and the purified enzyme had a KM of 1.4  mM and a Kcat of 103  s− 1 (Cavin et al. 1997 b). The corresponding gene, pdc, was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli (Cavin et al. 1997 a). This protein was crystallised and a structure obtained (Rodríguez et al. 2010). Based on the homology to the fdc and pdc a hydroxycinnamic <b>acid</b> (phenolic <b>acid)</b> <b>decarboxylase,</b> pad, was identified in Bacillus subtilis (Cavin et al. 1998). These hydroxycinnamic acid decarboxylases were shown to be active in vivo and in vitro and the purified enzymes did not require cofactors and {{were not part of}} multi subunit enzyme complexes. All these enzymes have in common that they are of bacterial origin and not active with cinnamic acid.|$|R
