500|$|The outflow clepsydra was a {{timekeeping}} device used in China as {{long ago}} as the Shang Dynasty (c.1600–c.1050BC), and certainly by the Zhou Dynasty (1122–256BC). The inflow clepsydra with an <b>indicator</b> <b>rod</b> on a float had been known in China {{since the beginning of the}} Han Dynasty in 202BC and had replaced the outflow type. The Han Chinese noted the problem with the falling pressure head in the reservoir, which slowed the timekeeping of the device as the inflow vessel was filled. Zhang Heng was the first to address this problem, indicated in his writings from 117, by adding an extra compensating tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Zhang also mounted two statuettes of a Chinese immortal and a heavenly guard on the top of the inflow clepsydra, the two of which would guide the <b>indicator</b> <b>rod</b> with their left hand and point out the graduations with their right. Joseph Needham states that this was perhaps the ancestor of all clock jacks that would later sound the hours found in mechanical clocks by the 8th century, but he notes that these figures did not actually move like clock jack figurines or sound the hours. Many additional compensation tanks were added to later clepsydras in the tradition of Zhang Heng. In 610 the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai crafted an unequal-armed steelyard balance able to make seasonal adjustments in the pressure head of the compensating tank, so that it could control the rate of water flow for different lengths of day and night during the year.

Early Mk IXs had a teardrop shaped blister for a Coffman engine starteron the lower starboard side cowling, just behind the propeller. This was replaced by an improved electric starter on most two-stage Merlin powered Spitfires and, from late 1942 the blister was only seen on a few aircraft. The Type C wing was fitted as standard.

In all cases, the action {{spectrum of the}} dark adapted animal peaked at 510 - 520 nm and fit Dartnall's template curve for the extinction spectrum of a vitamin A 1 -based visual pigment. High frequency flicker of the stimulus on a white background revealed a long-wavelengthsensitive photopic mechanism, establishing that these were duplex retinas.

5000|$|Click type torque {{wrenches}} are precise when properly calibrated—however {{the more complex}} mechanism can result in loss of calibration sooner than the beam type, where {{there is little to}} no malfunction, (however the thin <b>indicator</b> <b>rod</b> can be accidentally bent out of true). Beam type {{torque wrenches}} are impossible to use in situations where the scale cannot be directly read - and these situations are common in automotive applications. The scale on a beam type wrench is prone to parallax error, {{as a result of the}} large distance between indicator arm and scale (on some older designs). There is also the issue of increased user error with the beam type - the torque has to be read at every use and the operator must use caution to apply loads only at the floating handle's pivot point. Dual-beam or [...] "flat" [...] beam versions reduce the tendency for the pointer to rub, as do low-friction pointers.|$|E

With this arrangement no overflow tank was required, and the two attendants were warned when the clepsydra needed refilling.|$|E
40|$|Intraoral roentgenograms {{can be made}} {{according}} to the long-tube paralleling technique utilizing aiming devices. These instruments consist of a bite block, an <b>indicator</b> <b>rod,</b> and a collimator plate. For {{the position of the}} film in relation to the bite block surface, the following data are decisive and therefore studied: the length of the teeth to be radiographed, the enlargement {{as a result of the}} divergence of the x-ray beam, and the periapical area necessary for the interpretation and mounting of the roentgenograms. As a result, the bite blocks of the instruments were provided with three vertical steps to permit different film positions needed for the specific situation in the different regions of the mouth. The use of the correct film positions results in roentgenograms with a high diagnostic value. In order to reduce the patients radiation dose the aiming devices include a collimator plate. A description is given of the data used for the design of the plate...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. With funding provided by Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI), design of Secure, Transportable, Autonomous Reactors (STAR) to aid countries with insufficient energy supplies is underway. The development of a new monitoring system that allows remote access to data from the reactor site {{is an important part of}} this project. The two goals of this monitoring system are to control the use of nuclear materials and to monitor the performance of the facility from a remote location. I have designed a prototype system for this NERI project that utilizes LabVIEW software and global network technologies to monitor the Nuclear Science Center (NSC) reactor at Texas A&M University. LabVIEW and its applications have all the needed features to build a monitoring system for many types of facilities, including STAR reactors. This system takes data from reactor cooling systems, power monitoring channels, fuel temperature <b>indicators,</b> control <b>rod</b> drives, security alarm sensors and stores it on local and remote hard drives, sends it through an output port to remote clients, and graphically displays these data in the reactor control room. Data from NSC TRIGA reactor is fed to a computer program that analyzes and predicts reactor performance in real time. To provide a remote observation of the working area and fissile material, this system uses cameras, triggered by alarm sensors and LabVIEW vision applications. Operators at the local and remote control stations may view and store all the images from these cameras. The system has been in operation for many months at the NSC with outstanding results and further development is continuing...|$|R
40|$|Climatic {{conditions}} favourable to {{sea trout}} production continued their decline in 1984 and the indicators {{are now at}} their lowest since records commenced in 1948. The exodus of juvenile trout was poor and the age composition of landings in the Waterville fishery suggests finnock were not well represented in the summer catches. The reduced descent of juveniles to the sea and an upward tendency in the mean smolt age of newly recruited fish combine to reduce the prospects for specimen sea trout in the short term. In 1984 seven of these fish were reported, corroborating the reported cyclical trends in their production. All <b>indicators</b> of the <b>rod</b> catch suggest that a reduction in landings took place in 1984, from 1983. The average weight of individual sea trout taken was {{higher than in the}} previous year, due to a relatively poor finnock run. The ratio of sea trout to salmon fishing days was far higher than in the previous three years. Whether it represents a genuine switch in interest to the smaller species should be investigated in future years. A scrutiny of licence returns indicates, for the second year, that late season licences yield a high proportion of the total sea trout catch. Licence returns from commercial engines are difficult to interpret. Both drift and draft, however, suggest reduced landings from 1983, of both salmon and trout...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} current clinical method of examination of waveform of jugular vein pulse. However there are limitations of clinical assessment of {{central venous pressure}} by jugular vein pressure measurement from the level of sternal angle. There are variations in the reported distances from sternal angle to right atrium {{as well as to}} upper limit of JVP. In erect position, anterior end of fourth intercostal space is at about the level of mid-right atrium. In patients with visible JVP at neck in erect position, measurement of CVP can be done more accurately directly from the anterior end of fourth intercostal space. For others, the position of mid-right atrium can be marked in lateral chest wall first in erect position at the mid-point of an anteroposterior line from anterior end of fourth intercostal space to back. Subsequently in reclining position, the vertical height of venous pressure can be measured from the horizontal plane of the midpoint marked at lateral chest wall to visible upper limit of JVP. Such measurement can be done in a more reliable way with venous pressure (VP) manometer with its <b>indicator</b> <b>rod</b> at the horizontal plane of mid-right atrium and with its horizontal surface at upper limit of JVP. The venous pressure manometer {{can also be used to}} measure relatively less reliable upper limb venous pressure (ULVP), as indicated by the vertical distance at which veins of upper limb collapse, especially when JVP is not visualized due to subnormal CVP as in hypovolemia.
