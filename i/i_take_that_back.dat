Though <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>back,</b> {{for you and}} me {{might be}} hitting it for there {{together}} if you can rustle up the faith in me and the backbone in yourself for the trip. Well, anyway, it ain't so many years ago that I came ambling in there on a rusty, foul-bottomed, tramp collier from Australia, forty-three days from land to land. Seven knots was her speed when everything favoured, and we'd had a two weeks' gale to the north'ard of New Zealand, and broke our engines down for two days off Pitcairn Island.|$|E
5000|$|Reviews {{were almost}} universally negative, mostly distaste at the {{blending}} of grimy gross-out gags and up-beat musical humor. Roger Ebert's review was certainly scathing, stating [...] "Joe's Apartment {{would be a}} very bad comedy even without the roaches, but {{it would not be a}} disgusting one. No, wait: <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>back.</b> Even without the roaches, we would still have the subplot involving the pink disinfectant urinal cakes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{see that}} thou art very white and thin, but still alive, old woman," [...] sneered Eddo, adding: [...] "All the {{thousands}} of the people yonder thought that long ere this thou wouldst have passed within the Fence. May <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>that</b> good tidings to them?" ...|$|R

Without your leave I would not have given him the right to regard me as his own; but now <b>I</b> cannot <b>take</b> <b>that</b> right <b>back</b> again, even at your wish. I must write to him at once, mamma, and tell him this." ...|$|R

"I allowed Colonel James Easton came {{somewhere near}} bein' a soldier, {{even though he}} is only a militiaman," [...] the {{corporal}} said in a tone of intense dissatisfaction to Isaac as the two marched solemnly {{side by side in the}} midst of their disorderly companions, [...] "and I did think we could set out from here and capture Ticonderoga, if all hands were willin' to put their shoulders to the wheel; but <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>that</b> statement, lad, and am sorry I ever was so foolish as to enlist. I ought to have known better when I saw the crowd that was signin' the rolls." ...|$|R
5000|$|At the Chicago {{premiere of}} Jimmy Dean, Altman spoke of its festival acclaim to his audience: [...] "I {{never have had}} a film of mine {{received}} as well as this film—I don't understand it, but I like it!" [...] In a January 1983 interview with the Boston Globe, he stated that [...] "The critical reaction doesn't surprise me. Nothing surprises me any more. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>back.</b> One thing surprised me when I showed Jimmy Dean at film festivals—no one walked out." ...|$|E
5000|$|On March 31, 2009, Griffin {{announced}} {{that at that}} time the 10pm slot would not be filled because ratings of the Countdown rerun were higher. However, Cenk Uygur decided to continue the campaign anyway and decided to start [...] "Stage 2". On June 1, 2009, Griffin went back on what he said a few months earlier by saying:"Clearly it should be someone who is both smart and funny like she is.... But I will make one promise: we're not done yet! This is such a vibrant time in media, and I want to say to Rachel's audience - and everywhere I go I get stopped, there's such a connection between her and her audience, she's helped open a new world of approaches for us - that people who like Rachel will like our new 10o'clock show host and {{what we are going to}} do there. No, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>back,</b> Rachel's audience will love it! I promise." ...|$|E
5000|$|A typical {{reaction}} {{comes from}} the website [...] "Movies in the Attic":"I can't even explain how mind-bogglingly awful Fist Of Fear Touch Of Death is. The worst part is how it insults the intelligence of the viewer who has even mildly enjoyed a Bruce Lee movie. We hear Bruce Lee's grandpa was a samurai.(The fact that samurais were from Japan and Bruce Lee is Chinese notwithstanding) Just adds to the overall stupidity. Oh and then we get footage of Bruce Lee explaining to his mother that he beats people up because of his tradition of his samurai grandfather, what makes this movie so unbelievably bad is that this footage is shot like a soap opera and is then spliced in with a bad samurai movie. Actually <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> <b>back</b> the samurai movie maybe indeed good but taken in this direction it just shows adds up to the overall futile surroundings. Williamson is wasted, the tournament footage is lackluster and the Bill Louie cameo is just unbelievably stupid. This is without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brynner died of {{lung cancer}} on October 10, 1985, in New York City. A few days after his death, the {{recorded}} anti-cigarette public service announcement was shown on all the major US television networks and in many other countries. In it, he expressed his desire to make an anti-smoking commercial after discovering how sick he was, and that his death was imminent. He then looked directly into the camera for 30 seconds and said, [...] "Now that I'm gone, I tell you: Don't smoke. Whatever you do, just don't smoke. If <b>I</b> could <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>that</b> smoking, we wouldn't be talking about any cancer. I'm convinced of that." ...|$|R
5000|$|As he {{explained}} {{in an interview}} late in life, Tames took the photograph {{through the door of}} the Oval Office, after Kennedy thought he had left: [...] President Kennedy's back was broken during the war, when that torpedo boat of his was hit by the Japanese destroyer. As a result of that injury he wore a brace on his back most of his life. Quite a few people didn't realize that. Also he could never sit for any length of time, more than thirty or forty minutes in a chair without having to get up and walk around. Particularly when it felt bad he had a habit, in the House, and the Senate, and into the Presidency, of carrying his weight on his shoulders, literally, by leaning over a desk, putting down his palms out flat, and leaning over and carrying the weight of his upper body by his shoulder muscles, and sort of stretching or easing his back. He would read and work that way, which was something I had seen him do many times. When I saw him doing that, I walked in, stood by his rocking chair, and then I looked down and framed him between the two windows, and I shot that picture. I only made two exposures on it--we were very conservative with our film. Then I {{walked out of the room}} and stood there for a while, then I saw him straighten up. I went in again and I photographed him straight up, for a different shot, from the back, then I walked around to the side and photographed him profile, right and left. He had a copy of the New York Times, he was reading the editorial page--and I have that print right here, I was looking at it just the other day. He looked over and he saw me. He hadn't been aware <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> <b>that</b> picture from <b>back,</b> but he saw me when I moved to the side there. He glanced over at me, and he said: [...] "I wonder where Mr. Krock gets all the crap he puts in this horseshit column of his." [...] Apparently he was much upset about Mr. Krock's column that day. So that was the occasion of that picture.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha," [...] says Prestongrange, [...] "you {{are very}} fine to-day; my misses {{are to have}} a fine cavalier. Come, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> kind of you. <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> kind of you, Mr. David. O, we shall do very well yet, and I believe your {{troubles}} are nearly at an end." ...|$|R
6000|$|So I said to myself: [...] "I will do <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> will <b>take</b> <b>that</b> green {{watermelon}} <b>back</b> where I got it from." [...] And {{the minute}} I {{had said it}} I felt that great moral uplift that comes to you when you've made a noble resolution.|$|R
