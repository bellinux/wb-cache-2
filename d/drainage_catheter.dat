50|$|Pleurodesis fails {{in as many}} as 30% of cases. An {{alternative}} is to place a PleurX Pleural Catheter or Aspira <b>Drainage</b> <b>Catheter.</b> This is a 15Fr chest tube with a one-way valve. Each day the patient or care givers connect it to a simple vacuum tube and remove from 600 to 1000 mL of fluid, and can be repeated daily. When not in use, the tube is capped. This allows patients to be outside the hospital. For patients with malignant pleural effusions, it allows them to continue chemotherapy, if indicated. Generally, the tube is in for about 30 days and then it is removed when the space undergoes a spontaneous pleurodesis.|$|E
40|$|In 1985, two {{policies}} {{designed to}} reduce hospitalization charges for mastectomy patients were instituted at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center at Houston. The first was a policy of "same-day" admissions for elective surgery patients, and the second was early postoperative discharge for mastectomy patients with suction catheter drains in place. The economic savings resulting from these policies was analyzed by comparing demographics, operation, stage of disease, hospital stay, hospital charges, and complications for two groups of patients. Fifty-nine consecutive mastectomy patients treated between 1983 and 1984, before these policy changes, had "standard management" consisting of hospital admission 24 hours before surgery and discharge only after the surgical drains were removed. Sixty-one consecutive mastectomy patients treated between 1986 and 1987, after these policy changes went into effect, were admitted from the recovery room after surgery and were discharged with <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters</b> in place, usually within 72 hours. All operations were performed by the same faculty surgeon as a representative experience of the General Surgery faculty. The average hospital stay was reduced from 10. 5 to 4. 3 days. A mean 39 % reduction in hospital charges (from $ 4867. 00 to $ 2981. 00) was achieved by instituting the policies of "same-day" admission and early postoperative discharge with <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters</b> in place. Complication rates were not changed. Implementation of this policy resulted in an estimated savings of $ 750, 000. 00 in the hospital care of approximately 400 patients treated at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center at Houston each year. Adjustments in patient care delivery systems from a predominantly inpatient to an outpatient setting required changes in outpatient nursing responsibilities (although not in new personnel). Patient education and written instructions for home care of surgical wounds and <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters</b> were essential for implementing an early discharge policy. With these facts in mind, hospital admission {{on the day of}} operation and early postoperative discharge with <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters</b> in place should be the goal for most mastectomy patients...|$|R

Approximately 40% of medical intensive care units reportedly found that the majority, respectively 80% and 90.4%, of device-associated infections (namely, infections due to central lines, urinary <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters,</b> and ventilators) were due to vancomycin- and ampicillin-resistant E.faecium.|$|R
30|$|Pathologically, {{one of the}} {{following}} mechanisms might be implicated: (1) disruption of cutaneous or mucosal barriers 1 (e.g. bone fractures, injectable administration, <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters,</b> complications of intubation, endoscopic and surgical procedures, gastrointestinal tract tear); (2) infectious process with gas forming microorganisms; or (3) spontaneous alveolar rupture, when the pressure gradient between air-filled alveoli and their surrounding interstitial space is sufficient to cause alveolar rupture [2].|$|R
50|$|In pneumonia, a {{collection}} of fluid may form in the space that surrounds the lung. Occasionally, microorganisms will infect this fluid, causing an empyema. To distinguish an empyema from the more common simple parapneumonic effusion, the fluid may be collected with a needle (thoracentesis), and examined. If this shows evidence of empyema, complete drainage of the fluid is necessary, often requiring a <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter.</b> In severe cases of empyema, surgery may be needed. If the infected fluid is not drained, the infection may persist, because antibiotics do not penetrate well into the pleural cavity. If the fluid is sterile, it must be drained {{only if it is}} causing symptoms or remains unresolved.|$|E
50|$|Percutaneous {{drainage}} {{involves the}} guidance of a CT scan or ultrasound. A <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> is placed into the fluid cavity to drain the fluid, which is then collected over several weeks into an external collection system. The catheter is removed when the drainage becomes minimal. Once the catheter is removed, contrast is injected into the cyst cavity to determine the remaining size and to monitor progress. The success rate is around 50%, and the unsuccessful drainages are mostly caused by large ductal leaks or blockage of the main pancreatic duct. This {{method is not recommended}} when patients cannot manage a catheter at home or with patients whose cysts contain bloody or solid material.|$|E
50|$|Although RBS {{can occur}} after any {{procedure}} {{that requires a}} <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter,</b> RBS is probably best recognized after cardiac surgery, where chest tubes are used to drain blood from around the heart and lungs {{in the early hours}} after surgery. If the evacuation of blood is incomplete, RBS can occur. Clinically, RBS can be recognized acutely or subacutely. When it presents acutely, it is usually fresh thrombus around the heart or lungs presenting as tamponade or hemothorax. When it presents subacutely, it results in bloody pleural or pericardial effusions. Once RBS occurs, subsequent procedures may be needed to remedy it. In an analysis of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) data from 2010, RBS could be demonstrated in 17% of patients. In this analysis, mortality was doubled from 3% to 6%, length of stay was increased by 5 days, and average costs were 55% higher. Patients with RBS, therefore, appear to be at increased at risk for complications and costs.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the utility and {{advantages of the}} coaxial snare technique in the retrieval of tubular foreign bodies. Materials and Methods: Using the coaxial snare technique, we attempted to retrieve tubular foreign bodies present in seven patients. The bodies were either stents which were malpositioned or had migrated from their correct position in the vascular system (n= 2), a fragmented venous introducer sheath (n= 1), fragmented <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters</b> in the biliary tree (n= 2), or fractured external <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters</b> in the urinary tract (n= 2).

40|$|AIM: To {{introduce}} {{and evaluate}} the new method used in treatment of pancreatic and peripancreatic infections secondary to severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: A total of 42 SAP patients initially underwent ultrasound-guided percutaneous puncture and catheterization. An 8 -Fr <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> was used to drain the infected peripancreatic necrotic foci for 3 - 5 d. The sinus tract of the <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> was expanded gradually with a skin expander, and the 8 -Fr <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> was replaced with a 22 -Fr drainage tube after 7 - 10 d.

40|$|The flow-dependent left {{ventricle}} overload {{is a well-known}} complication of the veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in a severe cardiogenic shock, {{which leads to a}} distension of the {{left ventricle}} and, frequently, to a severe pulmonary edema. Recently, an unloading of the left ventricle using a catheter inserted to the left ventricle and connected to the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit has been proposed. The computational method was used to simulate the blood flow in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation system with a <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> incorporated to the left ventricle and connected to the inflow part of the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation circuit by a Y-shaped connector. The whole system was modelled in Modelica modelling language. The impact of various catheter sizes (from 5 Fr to 10 Fr) and extracorporeal blood flow values (from 1 L/min to 5 L/min) were investigated. In our simulation model, the extracorporeal blood flow only modestly affected the value of volume that was withdrawn from the left ventricle by a catheter. Conversely, the size of the <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> was the principal factor responsible for the achievement of the adequate left ventricle decompression.

40|$|SummaryChronic {{subdural}} hematoma (SDH) is {{a common}} clinical entity in neurosurgery. Craniostomy, including twist-drill holes or burr holes with or without drainage, is the treatment of choice for SDH. Despite convincing results from this surgical procedure, unexpected complications may still develop such as acute epidural hematoma, acute SDH, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), tension pneumocephalus, and empyema. We present a rare complication of an acute SDH located between the dura and the outer membrane instead of within the previous hematoma cavity (i. e., between the outer and the inner membrane), which occurred after chronic SDH burr-hole evacuation with closed-system drainage. This complication resulted from misplacement of the <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> and superimposed coagulopathy. In conclusion, precisely inserting the <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> in the chronic SDH space and reversing coagulopathy {{before and after the}} surgical procedure are necessary to prevent such complications...|$|E

Thirty-nine infants with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery who developed ARF at our center between January 2009 and January 2012 were assessed. A modified <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> for PD was used in these infants. Their demographic, clinical, and surgical data were analyzed. Thirty infants with ARF were cured by PD, and the other 9 died in the first 48 hours because of the severity of the acute cardiac dysfunction. All these infants were dependent upon mechanical ventilation during the postoperative period and used vasoactive drugs. In the survival group, the interval between the procedure and initiation of PD was 13. 6 6. 5 (range, 6 – 30) hours. PD duration was 3. 9 0. 9 (3 – 6) days. Minor complications were encountered in some patients (asymptomatic hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and thrombo-cytopenia). These complications were readily treated by drugs or resolved spontaneously. Hemodynamics, cardiac function, and renal function improved significantly during PD. These data suggest that PD using a modified <b>drainage</b> <b>catheter</b> for ARF after cardiac surgery in infants is safe, feasible, inexpensive, and yields good results.

40|$|Background: Lymphocoeles post renal {{transplantation}} can {{be difficult}} to see laparoscopically. The objective {{of this study was to}} report a new technique of catheter or guide‐wire placement for the guidance of laparoscopic marsupialization of symptomatic post renal transplant lymphocoeles, refractory to conservative therapy. Methods: Conventional aseptic technique under local anaesthesia was used for guide‐wire or catheter insertion, with the difference being the use of a transperitoneal approach. Computerized tomography (CT) or ultrasound (US) guidance was used. All lesions were confirmed to be sterile lymphocoeles beforehand by either needle aspiration or previous <b>catheter</b> <b>drainage.</b> Results: Four <b>catheters</b> and one guide‐wire were placed pre‐operatively without complication. All cases underwent satisfactory laparoscopic marsupialization. No immediate complications were noted in any patient. The <b>drainage</b> <b>catheters</b> were inserted between 5 and 19 days before laparoscopic marsupialization, and guide‐wire inserted immediately before. All patients proceeded to laparoscopic marsupialization.
