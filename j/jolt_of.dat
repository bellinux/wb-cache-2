The agung {{has been used to}} warn others of {{impending}} danger, announcing the time of day and other important occasions. For instance, long ago the sultan would beat the agung repeatedly to announce the onset of a meeting or during the fasting month of Ramadhan, the agung would ring either {{at three in the morning}} to indicate the signal to eat (sawl) or at sunset, to mark the end for fasting that day. And supposedly due to the deep, loud sound the agung produces, people believed that it possessed supernatural powers. For instance, during an earthquake, the locals of Maguindanao would strike the agung in a fast, loud rhythm called baru-baru, believing its vibrations would either lessen or even halt the <b>jolt</b> <b>of</b> an earthquake.|$|E

Having fairly well recovered from her injuries in the traumatic 1952 accident, she studied for a period in 1956 with the great abstract expressionist painter Hans Hofmann in Provincetown, Massachusetts, and this mentoring gave her a <b>jolt</b> <b>of</b> inspiration and encouragement. She soon had solo exhibitions at the Baltimore Museum of Art (1958), the Corcoran Gallery of Art (1962), the Bodley Gallery in New York (1963) and Goucher College (1963), among others.|$|E

Thunder without lightning {{is the result of the}} wind being too weak to emit any flame, but strong enough to produce a sound. A flash of lightning without thunder is a <b>jolt</b> <b>of</b> the air that disperses and falls, allowing a less active fire to break free. Thunderbolts are the result of a thicker and more violent air flow.|$|E

500|$|The breed {{exhibits}} a natural ambling gait, called the single-foot, which replaces the trot {{seen in a}} majority of horse breeds. Both gaits are an intermediate speed between a walk and a canter or gallop; ambling gaits are four-beat gaits, whereas the trot is a two-beat gait. The extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always {{has at least one}} foot on the ground. This minimizes movement of the horse's topline and removes the bounce of a two-beat gait, caused by a moment of suspension followed by the <b>jolt</b> <b>of</b> two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other.

Frantic {{and full of}} welcome ties to the past, it also ploughs new ground with purpose. Fingers crossed McG will follow Cameron's lead and serve up a worthy sequel." [...] Devin Faraci of Empire {{magazine}} also gave a positive rating of {{four out of five}} stars, saying: [...] "McG has sparked a moribund franchise back to life, giving fans the post-apocalyptic action they've been craving since they first saw a metal foot crush a human skull two decades ago." [...] However, on CHUD, the latter said, [...] "Bale's desire to star as John Connor was probably the most fatal blow to the film; it completely distorted the shape of the story as it existed." [...] Furthermore, he expressed that the third act was when the film began falling apart, saying, [...] "McG and Nolan muddied the end of the picture, delivering action generics (yet another Terminator fight in a factory) while never finding their own hook that would give this movie more of an impact than you would get from an expanded universe novel." [...] In contrast, James Berardinelli considered the ending {{the best part of the}} film, feeling that the first two-thirds were [...] "rambling and disjointed" [...] and that the lack of a central villain was only fixed when the T-800 appeared.|$|E
500|$|The Missouri Fox Trotter {{performs}} an ambling gait {{known as}} the [...] "fox trot", which replaces the trot seen in many other breeds. The fox trot is a four-beat broken diagonal gait in which the front foot of the diagonal pair lands before the hind, eliminating the moment of suspension and giving a smooth, sure-footed ride. The gait is sometimes described as having the horse walk with the front feet and trot with the back. In a fox trot, the horse must keep one front foot {{on the ground at}} all times and display a sliding motion with the hind legs. The fox trot and the regular trot are both at a speed between a walk and a canter or gallop; ambling gaits are four-beat gaits, whereas the trot is a two-beat gait. The extra footfalls provide additional smoothness to a rider because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground. [...] This minimizes movement of the horse's topline and removes the bounce of a two-beat gait, caused by a moment of suspension followed by the <b>jolt</b> <b>of</b> two feet hitting the ground as the horse shifts from one pair of legs to the other.

Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there‚Äôs a certain age group of boys who won‚Äôt admit they like the stuff. They really want to see the boy in that role." [...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always just assumed that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim. At one point, fans of the character had sent her over one million e-mails via her interactive website.|$|E
