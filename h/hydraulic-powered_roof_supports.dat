40|$|To {{measure the}} pushing {{distance}} of a <b>hydraulic-powered</b> <b>roof</b> <b>support,</b> and reduce the cost from a non-reusable displacement sensor embedded in pushing a hydraulic cylinder, an inertial sensor is {{used to measure the}} pushing distance, and a Kalman filter is applied to process the inertial data. To obtain better estimation performance, an improved fruit fly optimization algorithm (IFOA) is proposed to tune the parameters of the Kalman filter, processing noise covariance Q and observation noise covariance R. The key procedures of the proposed method, including state-space model, fitness function, and Kalman filter implementation, are presented. Finally, an artificial signal is utilized to verify the feasibility of the proposed method, and the tuning results of other algorithms, particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), basic FOA, and 3 D-FOA are compared. The proposed method is also applied in the pushing distance estimation scenario. The simulation and application results prove the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of machine designing is to balance between the economic requirements and the safety ones. Taking into account these requirements it was conducted the design work to elaborate the new concept of the mining <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> that fulfil them. The mining <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> is a mining equipment that has the most influence on the safety of work in deep coal mines and on the productivity of deep mines. Moreover the hydraulic <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> generally accounts for over 50 % of the total value of a coal mining and excavating system. It is considered not only with the complexity of the <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> but also with the accepted direction of the development of mining supports. Generally designers elaborate heavier constructions with props of larger diameters and loads. In this way the support system must be prepared not only to withdraw the rock mass forces but also the forces generated by its hydraulic system. These prerequisites underlie the new project of a <b>roof</b> <b>support.</b> This project bases also on many Polish patents concerning the mechanical devices and hydraulic equipment of a mining <b>roof</b> <b>support.</b> The main idea of the work was to elaborate the scheme of a support that will be compatible with the system of loads generated by the rock mass and by the conditions of work in a deep mine. As a result it was proposed the concept of a hydraulic <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> equipped with four props that work only in...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Risk-based roadway <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> {{design is}} now a {{critical}} part of the Australian Coal Industry. Safe and efficient mining demands that <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> be tailored to the prevailing geotechnical conditions and legislation in both NSW and QLD is clear in requiring that formalised <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> design be undertaken. The assumption of dead-load suspension of an otherwise unstable roof has been used in roadway <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> design for many years. However longevity does not necessarily translate into either best or even reasonable practice in the current industry, particularly when pro-active strata management systems are now routinely used and reinforcing support design methods are available. The paper discusses why the assumption of dead-load suspension is fundamentally incorrect in almost all instances when pro-active or reinforcing <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> is being applied and how it can easily result in misleading and potentially under-designed <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> systems under various circumstances. The commonly used design methodology of balancing the installed axial capacity of long tendons with the assumed “weight ” of a future roof fall is summarised and several fundamental flaws are identified.

40|$|Secondary <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> systems play a {{vital role}} in {{preserving}} the safety of underground mine workers by preventing the unintentional collapse of the mine roof. Hundreds of thousands of standing <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> are constructed each year in underground coal mines. Historically, wood and concrete cribs and timber posts have been used for secondary <b>roof</b> <b>support.</b> These support constructions require the handling of heavy and bulky materials, causing numerous injuries to the mine workers and resulting in more than 40, 000 lost workdays in the past 9 years. Since 1993, various alternative support technologies have been developed. These new support technologies not only provide superior <b>roof</b> <b>support,</b> but many also have significant material handling advantages by using smaller and lighter weight materials, fewer components, mechanically installed support systems, and pumpable support systems. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has conducted extensive material handling research and has developed recommended lifting thresholds to reduce material handling injuries. An analysis of <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> construction reveals that conventional support materials used in wood and concrete cribbing exceed the recommended lifting thresholds, while the engineered support systems are closer to the recommended weight thresholds. Finally, recommendations are made relative to proper lifting techniques and material handling practices to prevent injury to mine workers when constructing <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> in underground coal mines...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{presents}} the results of virtual analysis of the stability of mining <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> loaded by the roof rocks. The hydraulic <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> generally accounts for over 50 % of the total value of a coal mining and excavating system. Many reports show that in some conditions <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> behave differently than foreseen. To explain this phenomena the investigations basing on the virtual model were done [1, 2]. This phenomena is very dangerous for miners because this behaviour of a mining <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> may cause dangerous accidents in coal mines. In the investigation process some questions have been asked. Firstly what type of a mining support is more liable to this behaviour. Secondly what work conditions are the most dangerous. To analyse this phenomena it was used models of two types of a mining support. One with two props and one with four ones. Results show that that the problem of plunged of roof parts of a support in the coal bed is consider with the construction of the support. The most dangerous is the <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> with two props. The consequences of this results are the recommendations to use rather supports with four props then two...|$|R

40|$|As a {{decision-making}} problem, selecting proper {{machines and}} equipment {{plays a key}} role for mining sites and companies. Many factors affect this decision, and values belonging to these factors can be expressed numerically and/or non-numerically. In order to make the most appropriate decision, engineers must carry out an evaluation process that comprises all criteria that might affect decision-making. To achieve this, multi-criteria decision-making tools are used. As a result of technological developments, coal outputs in longwall mining have risen tremendously over the last decades, and longwall mechanisation has become unavoidable. The significance of powered <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> in particular increases day- by-day, since the rate of <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> has to be in accordance with the rate of face advance in longwalls. In this study, an integrated fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and fuzzy goal programming model is used to select the most suitable powered <b>roof</b> <b>supports.</b> The procedure is applied to a real-life underground coal mine that is operated using the longwall method. Seven alternative powered <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> are compared with each other, taking a total of 24 decision criteria under four main topics into account. In conclusion, the most suitable <b>roof</b> <b>supports</b> for the mine under study are determined and recommended to the decision-makers of the system...|$|R
40|$|Various <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> design methodologies {{have been}} used in Australian coal mines, which include analytical, {{numerical}} and empirical models. These models are mainly based on the deterministic approach in which a single factor of safety is calculated for the <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> design. The main limitation of this design methodology is that it fails to account for the inherent variations existing in rock mass properties and other roof reinforcement elements. To overcome this issue, an improved design methodology based on stochastic approaches has been developed in which both the design inputs parameters and the outcomes (i. e., factor of safety) are expressed as probability distribution functions. This paper focuses on the application of stochastic modelling technique to evaluate the underground <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> strategies currently used in an underground coal mine located in the Bowen Basin. The starting point of the analysis is the existing analytical <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> models that identified the relevant design inputs in consideration.

40|$|The initial Support Technology Optimization Program (STOP), Version 1. 0, was {{released}} at the 19 th Ground Control Conference. This original program {{has since been}} updated to Version 2. 3 which {{was released}} in May, 2001. This paper describes the additional features of Version 2. 3, focusing primarily on the following three aspects: (1) including uncontrolled convergence into the design requirements for standing <b>roof</b> <b>supports,</b> (2) the addition of design procedures for cable bolts as an alternative secondary <b>roof</b> <b>support,</b> and (3) the addition of new standing <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> technologies. Another new feature which should facilitate the development of design criteria for standing <b>roof</b> <b>support</b> is the capability to define ground reaction curves through convergence measurements alone without having to make support loading measurements. There are several other new features provided in Version 2. 3 which are only briefly addressed in the paper. These include: (1) additional graphics capabilities to facilitate rapid assessment of support comparisons, (2) an East-West designation for support selection to more accurately provide cost and support availability data, (3) additional safety measures including a safety factor to identify support design near the peak support capacity, checks {{to see if the}} support dimensions comply with aspect ratio requirements, and a measure of roof coverage for the design layout of the support system.
