The use of strychnine eggs employed by trained, licensed government pesticide applicators plus cooperation of local citizens {{proved to be a}} safe and selective method for conducting such a program. <b>Of</b> the 83 <b>skunks</b> diagnosed rabid by the Fluroescent Antibody Test as the Department of Livestock Diagnostic Laboratory in Bozeman, 72 percent were taken from control areas; however, <b>of</b> 284 <b>skunks</b> examined from control areas, 21 percent were diagnosed rabid, while 16 percent of the 142 total skunks tested for rabies from surveillance areas were infected with the disease. Little difference existed between the percent <b>of</b> <b>skunks</b> infected with the disease in rabies control and surveillance areas. The presence of apparent 2 ̆ 2 pockets 2 ̆ 2 of rabid animals developed, suggesting that perhaps within broad regions <b>of</b> <b>skunk</b> habitat there may exist smaller, localized populations <b>of</b> <b>skunks</b> that contain a reservoir of individuals infected with rabies.
