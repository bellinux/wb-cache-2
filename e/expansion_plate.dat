5000|$|A port {{expander}} {{can be any}} {{device to}} which one existing or onboard port becomes two or more - for example: a KVM switch or a USB hub. Such expanders offer the advantage of allowing more devices of a particular port type to be utilized at the same time. A major downside is that, for example, a 3Gbit/s port might have a hub or expander installed and now be able to accommodate 6 devices, but at a maximum of 3Gbit/s throughput bandwidth divided by the said 6 devices, or by however many are plugged in and being used. A port expander is a device that allows one port on a computer system to connect to multiple devices. Two basic forms of port expander exist: internal and external. An internal expander has a connection inside the computer, typically on the motherboard, and the only part the user sees is the <b>expansion</b> <b>plate</b> containing multiple ports. An external device plugs into the existing port and then has multiple places to connect. When {{not part of a}} computer system, these devices are commonly known as [...] splitters.|$|E

40|$|There are few cost {{evaluation}} studies of orthodontic treatment. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the costs of correcting posterior crossbites with Quad Helix (QH) or <b>expansion</b> <b>plates</b> (EPs) and to relate the costs to the effects. To determine which alternative has the lower cost, a cost-minimization analysis was undertaken, based on that the outcome of the treatment alternatives is identical. The study comprised 40 subjects in the mixed dentition, who had undergone treatment for unilateral posterior crossbite: 20 with QH and 20 with EPs. Duration of treatment, number of appointments, broken appointments, and cancellations were registered. Direct costs (for the premises, staff salaries, material and laboratory costs) and indirect costs (loss of income due to parent's assumed absence from work) were calculated and evaluated for successful treatment alone, for successful and unsuccessful treatment and re-treatment when required. The QH had significantly lower direct and indirect costs, with fewer failures requiring re-treatment. Even the costs for successful cases only were significantly lower in the QH than in the EP group. The results clearly show that in terms of cost-minimization, QH is the preferred method for correcting posterior crossbite in the mixed dentition...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: From an {{evidence-based}} {{point of}} view, correction of posterior crossbite is not sufficiently evaluated. Thus, {{the aims of}} this study were to compare and evaluate the effectiveness of different treatment strategies to correct unilateral posterior crossbite in the mixed dentition by using the randomized clinical trial methodology with an untreated control group. METHODS: Sixty patients participated in the study. All met the following inclusion criteria: mixed dentition, unilateral posterior crossbite, no sucking habits, and no previous orthodontic treatment. The patients were randomized into 4 groups: quad-helix, <b>expansion</b> <b>plate,</b> composite onlay, and untreated control. The success rates, amounts of maxillary and mandibular expansion, and treatment times were registered. RESULTS: The quad-helix appliance was superior to the <b>expansion</b> <b>plate</b> in success rate and treatment time. Treatment with the <b>expansion</b> <b>plate</b> was unsuccessful in one third of the subjects. Crossbite correction with composite onlay in the mixed dentition was ineffective, and spontaneous correction in the mixed dentition did not occur. CONCLUSIONS: If unilateral posterior crossbite is planned to be corrected in the mixed dentition, this study clearly confirmed that treatment with the quad-helix is an appropriate and successful method...|$|E

Two special problems are considered: (i) {{calculation of the}} fields in the forward and backward directions due to diffraction of a normally incident plane wave by two nonstaggered parallel plates; (ii) calculation of the field due to a line source {{in the presence of}} two staggered parallel plates when the source, the two edges, and the observation point are on a straight line. The crucial step in the ray-optical analysis is the calculation of the interaction between the plates. This calculation is performed by two methods, namely, the uniform asymptotic theory of edge diffraction and the method of modified diffraction coefficient. The relative merits of the two methods are discussed.

It was proved that number of rings had a significant impact on temperature rise value and the highest were during machine working with all three rings.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{orthodontic}} treatment effects on unilateral posterior crossbite in the primary and early mixed dentition by systematically reviewing the literature. A literature search was performed by applying the Medline database (Entrez PubMed) and covering the period from January 1966 to October 2002. The inclusion criteria were primary and early mixed dentition with unilateral posterior crossbite, randomized controlled trials (RCT), prospective and retrospective studies with concurrent untreated as well as normal controls, and clinical trials comparing at least two treatment strategies without any untreated or normal group involved. Two reviewers extracted the data independently and also assessed the quality of the studies. The search strategy resulted in 1001 articles, and 12 met the inclusion criteria. Two RCTs of early treatment of crossbite have been performed, and these two studies support grinding as treatment in the primary dentition. There is no scientific evidence available to show which of the treatment modalities, grinding, Quad-helix, <b>expansion</b> <b>plates,</b> or rapid maxillary expansion, is the most effective. Most of the studies have serious problems of lack of power because of small sample size, bias and confounding variables, lack of method error analysis, blinding in measurements, and deficient or lack of statistical methods. To obtain reliable scientific evidence, better-controlled RCTs with sufficient ample sizes are needed to determine which treatment is the most effective for early correction of unilateral posterior crossbite.

These experiments were conducted in the Langley 31 -Inch Mach 10 Tunnel and were initiated {{in support of the}} Space Shuttle Return-To-Flight Program. Two blunted-nose test surface geometries were developed, including an <b>expansion</b> <b>plate</b> test surface with nearly constant negative pressure gradient and a flat plate surface with nearly zero pressure gradient. The test surface designs and flow characterizations were performed using two-dimensional laminar computational methods, while the experimental boundary layer state conditions were inferred using the measured heating distributions. Three-dimensional computational predictions of the entire model geometry were used as a check on the design process. Both open-flow and closed-flow cavities were tested on each test surface. The cavity design parameters and the test condition matrix were established using the computational predictions. Preliminary conclusions based on an analysis of only the cavity centerline data indicate that the presence of the pressure gradient did not alter the open cavity heating for laminar-entry/laminar-exit flows, but did raise the average floor heating for closed cavities. The results of these risk-reduction studies will be used to formulate a heating assessment of potential damage scenarios occurring during future Space Shuttle flights. I. Nomenclatur...|$|E

40|$|SummaryCytokinesis {{partitions}} the cytoplasm of dividing eukaryotic cells. In higher plants, {{a dynamic}} microtubule array—phragmoplast—mediates {{the formation of}} the partitioning membrane—cell plate—in a centrifugal fashion [1, 2]. This phragmoplast dynamic involves microtubule-associated proteins [3 – 7]. Mutations in a novel Arabidopsis gene RUNKEL (RUK) result in cytokinesis defects caused by abnormal phragmoplast organization and arrested cell <b>plate</b> <b>expansion.</b> RUK encodes an essential cell-cycle-regulated 152 kDa protein with a putative serine/threonine kinase domain and a large microtubule-binding domain, both of which are largely conserved in uncharacterized proteins from protozoa, plants, and animals. RUK directly bound to microtubules in vitro and colocalized with mitotic preprophase band, spindle, and phragmoplast in vivo. An engineered RUK fusion protein that was degraded before telophase did not rescue the ruk mutant phenotype, demonstrating RUK action during cytokinesis. Both microtubule-binding domain and putative kinase domain were essential for RUK function. Surprisingly, RUK did not show kinase activity in vitro, and transgenically expressed “kinase-dead” RUK rescued the seedling lethality of ruk mutants. Our results suggest that RUK plays a regulatory, rather than catalytic, role in phragmoplast microtubule organization during cell <b>plate</b> <b>expansion</b> in cytokinesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Plant cells divide by the {{formation}} of new cross walls, known as cell plates, from the center to periphery of each dividing cell. Formation of the cell plate occurs in the phragmoplast, a complex structure composed of membranes, microtubules (MTs) and actin microfilaments (MFs). Disruption of phragmoplast MTs was previously found to completely inhibit cell <b>plate</b> formation and <b>expansion,</b> indicative of their {{crucial role in the}} transport of cell plate membranes and materials. In contrast, disruption of MFs only delays cell <b>plate</b> <b>expansion</b> but does not completely inhibit cell plate formation. Despite such findings, the significance and molecular mechanisms of MTs and MFs remain largely unknown. Results Time-sequential changes in MF-distribution were monitored by live imaging of tobacco BY- 2 cells stably expressing the GFP-actin binding domain 2 (GFP-ABD 2) fusion protein, which vitally co-stained with the endocytic tracer, FM 4 - 64, that labels the cell plate. During cytokinesis, MFs accumulated near the newly-separated daughter nuclei towards the emerging cell plate, and subsequently approached the expanding cell plate edges. Treatment with an actin polymerization inhibitor caused a decrease in the cell <b>plate</b> <b>expansion</b> rate, which was quantified using time-lapse imaging and regression analysis. Our results demonstrated time-sequential changes in the contribution of MFs to cell plate expansion; MF-disruption caused about a 10 % decrease in the cell <b>plate</b> <b>expansion</b> rate at the early phase of cytokinesis, but about 25 % at the late phase. MF-disruption also caused malformation of the emerging cell plate at the early phase, indicative of MF involvement in early cell <b>plate</b> formation and <b>expansion.</b> The dynamic movement of endosomes around the cell plate was also inhibited by treatment with an actin polymerization inhibitor and a myosin ATPase inhibitor, respectively. Furthermore, time-lapse imaging of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) revealed that MFs were involved in ER accumulation in the phragmoplast at the late phase. Conclusion By expression of GFP-ABD 2 and vital staining with FM 4 - 64, the dynamics of MFs and the cell plate could be followed throughout plant cytokinesis in living cells. Pharmacological treatment and live imaging analysis also allowed us to quantify MF contribution to cell <b>plate</b> <b>expansion</b> during cytokinesis. Our results suggest that MFs play significant roles in cell <b>plate</b> formation and <b>expansion</b> via regulation of endomembrane dynamics. </p...|$|R

Again, tectonism in the form of compressive horizontal stress, appears the most likely and common causation, though decreases in lithostatic pressure consequent on unloading and, in particular cases, surfi cial <b>expansion</b> of <b>plates</b> caused by the intense heat of fi res, may also contribute to rock failure and rupture. All A-tents are of Holocene age and are, therefore, neotectonic forms. Some have developed in living memory, and some are known to be developing from blisters.

Here, we show that two functionally redundant members of the Arabidopsis dynamin-related protein family, ADL 1 A and ADL 1 E, are essential for polar cell <b>expansion</b> and cell <b>plate</b> biogenesis. adl 1 A- 2 adl 1 E- 1 double mutants show defects in cell plate assembly, cell wall formation, and plasma membrane recycling. Using a functional green fluorescent protein fusion protein, we show that the distribution of ADL 1 A is dynamic and that the protein is localized asymmetrically to the plasma membrane of newly formed and mature root cells. We propose that ADL 1 -mediated membrane recycling is essential for plasma membrane formation and maintenance in plants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPre Stressing is {{a process}} of {{introducing}} residual compressive stresses zone around fastener holes which minimizes adverse effects of cyclic tensile stresses and retards the growth of fatigue cracks originating from the material flaws or surface imperfections. The present investigation is aimed at optimizing the inter hole distance between two adjacent cold expanded holes on a plate, limiting deformation of the material between holes to the elastic range by applying stress below the compressive yield strength of the material. It is found that ratio of central distance between holes to diameter of the holes (C/D) has a significant effect on the stress contours induced for a given percentage of <b>expansion.</b> The <b>plate</b> is modelled as a thick cylinder and equations are derived for radial stress. Graphs for these equations are plotted in MATLAB. ANSYS is used to conduct finite element analysis(FEA) of the cold expanded Mild Steel plate with two holes. To find the optimum centre distance between the two holes, the distance between the two holes was varied from 2 D to 3. 6 D in steps of 0. 2 D and its effects, studied. The stress patterns {{in the vicinity of the}} holes from the analytical and Finite Element Methods were found to be comparable, proving the correctness of the approach. The relationship between C/D and percentage of expansion is analyzed, thus, optimizing the percentage of expansion required for a given C/D...|$|R
