5|$|The {{low-pressure}} {{oxygen and}} low-pressure fuel turbopumps were mounted 180° apart on the orbiter's aft fuselage thrust structure. The {{lines from the}} low-pressure turbopumps to the high-pressure turbopumps contain flexible bellows that enable the low-pressure turbopumps to remain stationary {{while the rest of}} the engine is <b>gimbaled</b> for thrust vector control, and also to prevent damage to the pumps when loads were applied to them. The liquid-hydrogen line from the LPFTP to the HPFTP is insulated to prevent the formation of liquid air.|$|E
25|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{attitude of}} the vehicle was compared with the desired vehicle attitude in the LVDC. Attitude correction signals from the LVDC were converted into control commands by the flight control computer. The required thrust direction was obtained by gimbaling the engines in the propelling stage to change the thrust direction of the vehicle. Gimbaling of these engines was accomplished through hydraulic actuators. In {{the first and second}} stages (S-IC and S-II), the four outboard engines were <b>gimbaled</b> to control roll, pitch, and yaw. Since the third (S-IVB) stage has only one engine, an auxiliary propulsion system was used for roll control during powered flight. The auxiliary propulsion system provides complete attitude control during coast flight of the S-IUB/IU stage.|$|E
500|$|The booster was {{designed}} to have four independent propulsion systems, {{the first of which}} – main rocket propulsion – would be based on three <b>gimbaled</b> Vulcain engines fueled by [...] of propellant.

Further, ten [...] thrusters placed {{on each side of the}} vehicle would be used by the reaction control system. Finally, the fourth propulsion system would be based on solid rocket motors that separate the boosters from the core stage. An up-scaled version of the motors used in existing EAP boosters would be mounted in the attachment ring and inside the wing's main structure.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prominent}} tower {{within the}} arena was a mobile test frame/crane (Fahrbare Kranbühne) {{which could be}} moved over the flame pit to position the rocket nozzle 25 feet above the deflector, and which allowed an entire missile to be <b>gimbaled</b> in two directions up to five degrees from vertical. [...] The tower included an elevator and a German-made Toledo scale for thrust measurements. [...] Actual launches were from a steel table-like structure (firing stand, Brennstand) across the railway from the flame pit on the test stand's large concrete foundation. [...] Under the concrete foundation were the recorder room, a small shop, an office, compressed nitrogen storage cylinders, and catch tanks. [...] The arena also included an engine cold-calibration pad for conducting flow test measurements by pumping water (instead of Liquid oxygen) and alcohol (which was recovered afterward) via the turbopump through the combustion chamber. [...] Since the V-2 motor had no controller for the turbopump, cold-calibration allowed the determination of [...] "freak cases" [...] of equipment.|$|E
