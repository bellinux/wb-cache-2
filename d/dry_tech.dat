5000|$|The <b>dry</b> <b>tech</b> is {{essentially}} a rehearsal without the performers. It is a period, usually lasting multiple hours, where each designer and department head runs his or her segment of the production. It is also {{a chance for the}} tech crew who will operate the equipment to become familiar with the flow of the performance. Usually it consists of the lights being cued in sequential order, fixing any problems along the way such as brightness, angle, framing, or position.|$|E
50|$|Once {{completed}} as {{many times}} as the director feels comfortable, the tech will end. Any number of actions can usually be taken after a tech such as the running of problematic scenes or acts, another <b>dry</b> <b>tech</b> to work out problematic technical issues, or certain performers may be held to work with certain effects that the other performers aren't needed for. After all this is completed, the tech rehearsal is officially over, and the next rehearsal to be performed is the dress rehearsal, then final dress.|$|E
50|$|Tech rehearsals {{generally}} are {{broken down into}} four types: <b>dry</b> <b>tech</b> rehearsals, tech rehearsals, pick-up tech rehearsals, and paper tech. They consist of fully testing {{out all of the}} technology being used in the performance (lighting, sound, automation, special effects ((e.g. pyrotechnics), etc.) to diagnose and prevent mistakes from occurring during the actual performance. It also gives the designers the opportunity to see how their designs will impact each other (i.e. how the color of a light might affect the look of a costume), and to make final changes.|$|E
40|$|This {{project was}} carried out to {{investigate}} {{the possibility of using}} wood gas as a direct replacement for natural gas in textile <b>drying.</b> The Georgia <b>Tech</b> updraft gasifier was used for the experimental program. During preliminary tests, the 1 million Btu/hr pilot plant produced clean burning gas which appeared viable for drying textiles. The gasifier was coupled to a modified textile drying oven and a series of tests were carried out to assess product degradation of white, colored, and chemically treated fabrics...|$|R
40|$|A {{microwave}} heater and/or dryer has a nonlinear or curvilinear relative slot profile geometry. In one embodiment, {{the microwave}} dryer {{has at least}} one adjustable field modifier making it possible to change the geometry of the heater or dryer when drying different webs. In another embodiment, the microwave dryer provides more uniform drying of a web when the field modifier is adjusted in response to a sensed condition of the web. Finally, a method of microwave heating and/or drying a web achieves a uniform heating and/or <b>drying</b> profile. Georgia <b>Tech</b> Research Corporatio...|$|R
5000|$|The Droog collection, {{curated by}} Renny Ramakers, {{consists}} of around 200 products {{by more than}} a hundred designers. New designs are often developed and presented in relation with exhibitions (such as the knotted chair of Marcel Wanders during <b>Dry</b> <b>Tech</b> I on the Milan Furniture Fair 1996)."Saved by Droog" [...] is an element of Droog design that buys up stock and transforms it into something completely new with a distinct voice and purpose. The Droog collection is distributed through the website, via the droog stores and via retailers worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|Prior to this point, {{the actors}} {{may have been}} rehearsing in a {{separate}} rehearsal hall, or on the stage but without all technical elements present. The director, designers, and crew may have already run through the technical elements of the show without the actors, {{also known as a}} <b>dry</b> <b>tech.</b> At this point in the rehearsal process, it is expected that the creative aspects of the production are ready. Actors have their lines memorized; lights, sound, scenery, and costumes have been designed and completely constructed. If the production is a musical, then the pit orchestra has rehearsed the music completely, and any dancers are prepared with their choreography memorized. During technical week all of the various technical elements are fully implemented, making the rehearsals very similar to the actual performance.|$|E
50|$|During the tech, {{all of the}} {{previous}} actions taken during the <b>dry</b> <b>tech</b> are repeated, so as to check lighting in concordance with the staged blocking and stage placement (for example, finding whether the performer is in the light hotspot or not, or how the followspot operates), check the levels on the performers' microphones (if used) and how well the performers can project if orating concurrently with sound or music, allow the performers to know when there are incoming flying rigs, allow performers to experience and become accustomed to the special effects that will occur {{so that it will}} not interfere with the actual performance and generally make sure the director and designers are happy with all aspects of the production that can be seen or heard. One very significant effect that is added in tech is blood. This allows actors {{to get used to it}} and the costume designer to see how the blood will affect the costumes.|$|E
40|$|Stage {{managing}} Ajax in Iraq was my {{introduction to}} Linfield Theatre. As a stage manager, I {{was able to}} explore {{all aspects of the}} show. In production meetings weekly we discussed the agenda for the week and what was planned to be done as the week went on. In the beginning weeks, we looked at costume sketches and discussed ideas for incorporating different visions and how to make them come to life onstage. As stage manager, I worked with designers, the tech crew, and actors. I quickly learned what my responsibilities were in rehearsal and made my best effort to do my job {{in a way that was}} the most beneficial to both the actors and the director, as well as communicating with the entire production team. With cue-to-cue, I learned how the collaboration between sound design, lighting design, costumes, and the directing vision shapes and creates the world of the play. I learned it is better to be safe than sorry; if you have an inkling that you might want something to happen in a certain place, it is best to insert a cue because it is less stressful to delete cues than it is to create them later on. During <b>dry</b> <b>tech,</b> I learned there are a lot of things that need to come together for the show to look nice and that there were many intermediate steps in which I wasnâ€™t involved. Tech with actors was a whole new experience and another lesson in communication: keep the ball rolling but make sure everything is functioning the way it should. Tech ironed out the logistics of the play, and with the addition of actors there was a whole other group to communicate with. Teching the show and learning to call cues was perhaps the most exciting and most nerve-wracking part of the tech process. The teamwork of theatre is demonstrated throughout the entire process from sketches, to discussion, to rehearsal, to tech, and finally production nights, where all the hard work comes together. Knowing I have people depending on me for the show to go smoothly was a big responsibility and one that I am grateful to have experienced. Being the communication vein between the actors and the director as well as the design team helped to hone my communication skills and helped me develop an efficient way of getting information across. I learned to work with many different kinds of people and adapt in a way that got information across in a way that was most beneficial to them...|$|E
