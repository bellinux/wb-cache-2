40|$|The {{establishment}} of the invasive lionfish complex Pterois volitans and P. miles from the Indo- Pacific into the Western Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and the Caribbean Sea has had significant negative effects on reef fish biodiversity in these areas. The rapid colonization and high abundance of lionfishes in their expanded range {{have been attributed to}} several aspects of their biology and life history, such as a varied diet and high fecundity. Invasive lionfishes may also be benefiting from enemy release, experiencing decreased predation and / or parasitism pressure relative to native fishes. However, the parasite fauna of invasive lionfishes remain poorly studied; making it difficult to assess the potential role parasite release may have played in their successful invasion of the Greater Caribbean. To address this knowledge gap, endoparasite biodiversity and community structure were assessed in 516 lionfishes from 15 sites in the Western North Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Sea. Sites ranged from Bermuda and North Carolina southwards to Trinidad and Tobago, effectively covering much of the hosts’ expanded range. The most commonly observed parasite was the digenean Lecithochirum floridense. Eight new parasites were described {{for the first time in}} lionfishes: a cymothoid isopod, Rocinela stignata; four nematodes, Raphidascaris sp., Contracaecum sp., Paracuaria adunca and Hysterothylaceum sp.; one digenean: Tergestia sp.; two acanthocephalans, Serracentis sp. and Dollfusentis sp., and two cestodes: Nybelinia sp. and Tentacularia sp. A leech, tentatively identified as Trachelobdella lubrica, was also noted. Regarding parasite community structure, several patterns emerged. First, the endoparasite fauna of invasive Lionfishes was largely composed of widely-occurring generalist species. Second, endoparasite diversity and abundance were low (1 - 6 species); we did not observe any parasites in lionfishes from Bonaire, Barbados, or Texas. Thus, our data suggest that lionfishes may be benefiting to some extent from release from parasitism. Third, although there were broad differences among sites in endoparasite community structure, none could be correlated to broad ecological factors such as latitude, although there were slight differences among bioregions (ANOSIM Global-R 0. 069, p = 0. 014). Lastly, lionfishes from the east coast of Florida exhibited the highest endoparasite abundances and diversity in this survey. We regressed endoparasite species diversity against date of first observation of lionfishes at each site, and found a significant (r 2 = 0. 368,DF = 1, F = 7. 57, p = 0. 017) positive relationship. Previous studies have noted <b>increasing</b> <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> and abundance in introduced species in the years following their establishment; we suggest that a similar process may be at work in Greater Caribbean lionfishes...|$|E

40|$|Host-parasite {{evolutionary}} {{interactions are}} typically considered in a pairwise species framework. However, natural infections frequently involve multiple <b>parasites.</b> Altering <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> alters ecological and evolutionary dynamics as parasites compete and hosts resist multiple infection. We investigated {{the effects of}} <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> on host-parasite population dynamics and evolution using the pathogen P. aeruginosa and five lytic bacteriophage parasites. To manipulate <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> bacterial populations were exposed for 24 hours to either phage monocultures or diverse communities containing up to five phages. Phage communities suppressed host populations more rapidly but also showed reduced phage density, likely due to inter-phage competition. The evolution of resistance allowed rapid bacterial recovery that was greater in magnitude with increases in phage diversity. We observed {{no difference in the}} extent of resistance with <b>increased</b> <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> but there was a profound impact on the specificity of resistance; specialized resistance evolved to monocultures through mutations in a diverse set of genes. In summary, we demonstrate that <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> has rapid effects on host-parasite population dynamics and evolution by selecting for different resistance mutations and affecting the magnitude of bacterial suppression and recovery. Finally, we discuss the implications of phage diversity for their use as biological control agents...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In insects, {{including}} Anopheles mosquitoes, Dscam (Down syndrome {{cell adhesion}} molecule) {{appears to be}} involved in phagocytosis of pathogens, and shows pathogen-specific splice-form expression between divergent pathogen (or parasite) types (e. g. between bacteria and Plasmodium or between Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum). Here, data are presented from the first study of Dscam expression in response to genetic <b>diversity</b> within a <b>parasite</b> species. Methods In independent field and laboratory studies, a measure of Dscam splice-form diversity was compared between mosquitoes fed on blood that was free of P. falciparum to mosquitoes exposed to either single or mixed genotype infections of P. falciparum. Results Significant increases in Anopheles gambiae Dscam (AgDscam) receptor diversity were observed in parasite-exposed mosquitoes, but only weak evidence that AgDscam diversity rises further upon exposure to mixed genotype parasite infections was found. Finally, a cluster of AgDscam exon 4 variants that become especially common during Plasmodium invasion was identified. Conclusions While the data clearly indicate that AgDscam diversity increases with P. falciparum exposure, they do not suggest that AgDscam diversity rises further in response to <b>increased</b> <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|Plasmodium falciparum, {{the most}} virulent human malaria parasite, {{undergoes}} asexual reproduction within the human host, but reproduces sexually within its vector host, the Anopheles mosquito. Consequently, the mosquito {{stage of the}} parasite life cycle provides an opportunity to create genetically novel parasites in multiply-infected mosquitoes, potentially <b>increasing</b> <b>parasite</b> population <b>diversity.</b> Despite the important implications for disease transmission and malaria control, a quantitative mapping of how <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> entering a mosquito relates to <b>diversity</b> of the <b>parasite</b> exiting, has not been undertaken. To examine the role that vector biology plays in modulating <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> we develop a two-part model framework that estimates the diversity {{as a consequence of}} different bottlenecks and expansion events occurring during the vector-stage of the parasite life cycle. For the underlying framework, we develop the first stochastic model of within-vector P. falciparum parasite dynamics and go on to simulate the dynamics of two parasite subpopulations, emulating multiply infected mosquitoes. We show that incorporating stochasticity is essential to capture the extensive variation in parasite dynamics, particularly in the presence of multiple parasites. In particular, unlike deterministic models, which always predict the most fit parasites to produce the most sporozoites, we find that occasionally only parasites with lower fitness survive to the sporozoite stage. This has important implications for onward transmission. The second part of our framework includes a model of sequence diversity generation resulting from recombination and reassortment between parasites within a mosquito. Our two-part model framework shows that bottlenecks entering the oocyst stage decrease <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> from what is present in the initial gametocyte population in a mosquito's blood meal. However, diversity increases with the possibility for recombination and proliferation in the formation of sporozoites. Furthermore, when we begin with two parasite subpopulations in the initial gametocyte population, the probability of transmitting more than two unique parasites from mosquito to human is over 50 % {{for a wide range of}} initial gametocyte densities...|$|R

A study of great blue heron nestlings was undertaken in order to understand trends in the endohelminth fauna of nestling birds as they mature from hatching to fledging. Fourteen birds were collected from Port Lavaca, Texas during the spring of 1994. Their age was determined, and the nestlings were separated into four different age groups: 1 - 2 weeks old, 3 - 4 weeks old, 5 - 6 weeks old, and 7 weeks and older. Five different species of endohelminths were recovered from the nestlings: Phagicola sp., Stephanoprora sp., Contracaecum sp., a cestode, and an acanthocephalan. Phagicola sp. specimens were found in extremely high numbers (range= 0 37467) and comprised a majority of the parasites recovered. The species of Phagicola recovered was difficult to determine due to inconsistencies in the literature about the taxonomy of Phagicola. Analysis of variance of the number of parasites in the different age groups of nestlings revealed that there were statistical differences (p=. 045). The number of overall parasites as well as the number of Phagicola increased as the age of the nestlings increased. Phagicola specimens were proven statistically to be more common in one area of the intestine relative to the three other areas of the intestine examined. The correlation between the number of Phagicola and the weight of the birds was significant (r=. 748), and the data shows a parabolic increase in Phagicola as the weight of the nestling <b>increased.</b> <b>Parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> did not change significantly, and the <b>diversity</b> of <b>parasites</b> was low in comparison to other studies of bird endohelminth populations.

In particular, simultaneous infections from multiple parasite species should cause diversification (i. e. balancing selection) in resistance genes both at the population and the individual level.

In eight natural populations, <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> (15 different species), and MHC class IIB diversity varied strongly between habitat types (lakes vs. rivers vs. estuaries) with lowest values in rivers.

40|$|The {{adaptive}} {{potential of}} a species to a changing environment and in disease defence is primarily based on genetic variation. Immune genes, such as genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), may thereby be of particular importance. In marsupials, however, {{there is very little}} knowledge about natural levels and functional importance of MHC polymorphism, despite their key role in the mammalian evolution. In a previous study, we discovered remarkable differences in the MHC class II diversity between two species of mouse opossums (Gracilinanus microtarsus, Marmosops incanus) from the Brazilian Atlantic forest, {{which is one of the}} most endangered hotspots for biodiversity conservation. Since the main forces in generating MHC diversity are assumed to be pathogens, we investigated in this study gastrointestinal parasite burden and functional associations between the individual MHC constitution and parasite load. We tested two contrasting scenarios, which might explain differences in MHC diversity between species. We predicted that a species with low MHC diversity would either be under relaxed selection pressure by low <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> (`Evolutionary equilibrium` scenario), or there was a recent loss in MHC diversity leading to a lack of resistance alleles and <b>increased</b> <b>parasite</b> burden (`Unbalanced situation` scenario). In both species it became apparent that the MHC class II is functionally important in defence against gastrointestinal helminths, which was shown here for the first time in marsupials. On the population level, <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> did not markedly differ between the two host species. However, we did observe considerable differences in the individual parasite load (parasite prevalence and infection intensity) : while M. incanus revealed low MHC DAB <b>diversity</b> and high <b>parasite</b> load, G. microtarsus showed a tenfold higher population wide MHC DAB <b>diversity</b> and lower <b>parasite</b> burden.

40|$|<b>Parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> and {{abundance}} (<b>parasite</b> load) vary greatly among host species. However, {{the influence of}} host traits on variation in parasitism remains poorly understood. Comparative studies of parasite load have largely examined measures of parasite species richness and are predominantly based on records obtained from published data. Consequently, {{little is known about}} the relationships between host traits and other aspects of parasite load, such as parasite abundance, prevalence and aggregation. Meanwhile, understanding of parasite species richness may be clouded by limitations associated with data collation from multiple independent sources. We conducted a field study of Lake Tanganyika cichlid fishes and their helminth parasites. Using a Bayesian phylogenetic comparative framework, we tested evolutionary associations between five key host traits (body size, gut length, diet breadth, habitat complexity and number of sympatric hosts) predicted to influence parasitism, together with multiple measures of parasite load. We find that the number of host species that a particular host may encounter due to its habitat preferences emerges as a factor of general importance for <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> abundance and prevalence, but not parasite aggregation. In contrast, body size and gut size are positively related to aspects of parasite load within, but not between species. The influence of host phylogeny varies considerably among measures of parasite load, with the greatest influence exerted on <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity.</b> These results reveal that both host morphology and biotic interactions are key determinants of host-parasite associations and that consideration of multiple aspects of parasite load is required to fully understand patterns in parasitism...|$|R
40|$|Estimates of {{the total}} number of species that inhabit the Earth have {{increased}} significantly since Linnaeus's initial catalog of 20, 000 species. The best recent estimates suggest that there are ≈ 6 million species. More emphasis has been placed on counts of free-living species than on parasitic species. We rectify this by quantifying the numbers and proportion of parasitic species. We estimate that there are between 75, 000 and 300, 000 helminth species parasitizing the vertebrates. We have no credible way of estimating how many parasitic protozoa, fungi, bacteria, and viruses exist. We estimate that between 3 % and 5 % of parasitic helminths are threatened with extinction in the next 50 to 100 years. Because patterns of <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> do not clearly map onto patterns of host diversity, we can make very little prediction about geographical patterns of threat to parasites.

40|$|Disturbance, productivity, {{and natural}} enemies are {{significant}} determinants {{of the evolution}} of diversity, but their interactive effect remains unresolved. We develop a simple, qualitative model assuming trade-offs between growth rate, competitive ability and parasite resistance, to address the interactive effects of these variables on the evolution of host diversity. Consistent with previous studies our model predicts maximum diversity at intermediate levels of disturbance and productivity in the absence of parasitism. However, parasites break down these unimodal diversity relationships with productivity and disturbance, as selection for parasite resistance reduces the importance of growth rate-competitive ability trade-offs. We tested these predictions using the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, which undergoes an adaptive radiation into spatial niche specialists under laboratory conditions. This is the first study of adaptive radiation in response to experimental manipulation of the three-way interaction between productivity, disturbance, and natural enemies. As hypothesized, unimodal diversity relationships with disturbance and productivity were weakened or disappeared in the presence of parasitic phages. This was the result of phages increasing diversity at environmental extremes, by imposing selection for phage-resistant variants, but decreasing diversity in less stressful environments, probably through reductions in resource competition. Phages had a net effect of <b>increasing</b> host <b>diversity.</b> <b>Parasites</b> and other natural enemies are therefore likely to have a large effect in mitigating the influence of other environmental variables on the evolution and maintenance of diversity...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Wiley via the DOI in this record. <b>Parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> and abundance (<b>parasite</b> load) vary greatly among host species. However, the influence of host traits on variation in parasitism remains poorly understood. Comparative studies of parasite load have largely examined measures of parasite species richness, and are predominantly based on records obtained from published data. Consequently, {{little is known about}} the relationships between host traits and other aspects of parasite load, such as parasite abundance, prevalence, and aggregation. Meanwhile, understanding of parasite species richness may be clouded by limitations associated with data collation from multiple independent sources. We conducted a field study of Lake Tanganyika cichlid fishes and their helminth parasites. Using a Bayesian phylogenetic comparative framework, we tested evolutionary associations between five key host traits (body size, gut length, diet breadth, habitat complexity, number of sympatric hosts) predicted to influence parasitism, together with multiple measures of parasite load. We find that the number of host species that a particular host may encounter due to its habitat preferences emerges as a factor of general importance for <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity,</b> abundance, and prevalence, but not parasite aggregation. In contrast, body size and gut size are positively related to aspects of parasite load within, but not between species. The influence of host phylogeny varies considerably among measures of parasite load, with the greatest influence exerted on <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity.</b> These results reveal that both host morphology and biotic interactions are key determinants of host-parasite associations, and that consideration of multiple aspects of parasite load is required to fully understand patterns in parasitism...|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of complex life cycles can <b>increase</b> <b>parasite</b> fitness. Some parasites have, by host manipulation, further increased their reproductive success. Host manipulation is a trait shown in some parasites, where they effectively {{can change the}} behavior or morphology of their intermediate host {{in a way that}} <b>increases</b> the <b>parasite's</b> trophic transmission.|$|R
40|$|Aim: Habitat use and {{migration}} strategies of animals are {{often associated with}} spatial variation in parasite pressure, but how they relate to one another is not well understood. Here, we use a large dataset on helminth species richness of Charadriiform birds to test whether higher habitat diversity and seasonal migration <b>increase</b> <b>parasite</b> richness in avian hosts. Location: Global. Methods: We compiled a global dataset on helminth species richness, habitat use strategies (marine/freshwater/mixed wintering and osmotic generalist/specialist) and various ecological/life-history traits (migration distance, geographical range size, diet, body mass, sampling latitude) of Charadriiform birds. To test if hosts with different habitat use strategies encounter different parasite pressures, we used comparative methods that correct for shared ancestry and phylogenetic uncertainty. Results: Habitat generalists (mixed wintering habitats and osmotic generalists) harboured more parasite species than habitat specialists; marine- and freshwater-restricted hosts had similar helminth species richness. Contrary to previous results, we found no association between parasite species richness {{and migration}} distance. Overall helminth species richness also increased with diet diversity, with no effects of other ecological/life-history traits. Main conclusions: We suggest that birds exploiting diverse habitats and diets are exposed to a more diverse parasite fauna and conclude that distribution patterns and habitat use, rather than migration distance, shape <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> within host populations. Overall, these results demonstrate the significant role of habitat use in explaining how migration may indirectly affect parasite richness in host populations...|$|R

40|$|Native {{amphibian}} {{populations are}} shrinking worldwide, and both parasitic infections and environmental stress from agriculture have been implicated. We investigated the principal hypothesis that environmental by-products of agricultural activity mediate parasitism in native frogs. Bullfrogs {{were collected from}} wetlands with variable landscape disturbance and water quality and examined for helminth parasites. We predicted that pesticide pollution and landscape development would be significant factors shaping the parasite communities and populations. <b>Parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> and species richness were lower in wetlands impacted by both pesticides and land use. Two parasite groups, direct life-cycle nematodes and echinostomes, were common in polluted habitats, potentially increasing frog pathology and mortality risk. In areas with agricultural landscape and reduced forest cover, <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> and species richness were low, perhaps because of less parasite transmission from birds and mammals. This result suggests that land development limits terrestrial vertebrate access to wetlands. Our results indicate that parasite abundance and community structure in wetlands are influenced by factors operating locally within the wetland and more broadly in the surrounding landscape. We suggest that parasite communities in amphibians are effective indicators of ecosystem health and animal biodiversity, and thus useful tools for conservation biology. Crown Copyright © 2009...|$|R
40|$|Many parasites exhibit {{antigenic}} variation within their hosts. We use mathematical models {{to investigate the}} dynamical interaction between an antigenically varying parasite and the host's immune system. The models incorporate {{antigenic variation}} in the parasite population and the generation of immune responses directed against (i) antigens specific to individual parasite variants and (ii) antigens common to all the parasite variants. Analysis of the models allows us to evaluate {{the relative importance of}} variant-specific and cross-reactive immune responses in controlling the parasite. Early in the course of infection within the host, when <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> is below a defined threshold value (the value is determined by the biological properties of the parasite and of the host's immune response), the variant-specific immune responses are predominant. Later, when the <b>parasite</b> <b>diversity</b> is high, the cross-reactive immune response is largely responsible for controlling the parasitemia. It is argued that increasing antigenic diversity leads to a switch from variant-specific to cross-reactive immune responses. These simple models mimic various features of observed infections recorded in the experimental literature, including an initial peak in parasitemia, a long and variable duration of infection with fluctuating parasitemia that ends with either the clearance of the parasite or persistent infection...|$|R
