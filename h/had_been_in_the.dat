5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the head <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the head <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E

5|$|Although the Spanish had won decisive {{victories}} at Sonsonate and Acajutla, {{they failed}} to take the fortified Pipil cities of Cuscatlan and Izalco. Alvarado was informed that extensive lands lay ahead, with difficult terrain, many cities, and large populations. Frustrated {{by the lack of}} progress, Alvarado withdrew to Guatemala to regroup, with the intention of returning in the dry season; He <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> province of Cuscatlan for seventeen days, and left it at the end of June 1524.|$|E

5|$|An {{expansion}} to the Spion Kop terracing in the 1920s increased Anfield's capacity. Liverpool's fortunes declined {{during the}} inter-war years, when the club often finished in midtable. Liverpool became League champions again in 1947, {{in the first}} season after the Second World War, but following a slow downturn in performance the club was relegated to the Second Division in 1954. By the time of Shankly's appointment in 1959, Liverpool <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second Division for five seasons.|$|E
5|$|Chrétien's {{position}} {{was far more}} difficult than Johnson's: Part of the 1993 Liberal election platform had been moving the country away from large scale constitutional debates. Provincial governments were also far more hostile to the constitutional process than they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decade prior, with even the federal government's typical ally, Ontario, being firmly against any pursuit of constitutional accommodation.|$|E
5|$|During 1947 Katsura {{caught the}} eye of American {{serviceman}} Vernon Greenleaf (no relation to the pool and carom billiards champion Ralph Greenleaf), a master sergeant in the U.S. Army's Quartermaster Corps who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> armed services for 22 years. Katsura and Greenleaf first met in a Tokyo service club where she was giving billiard exhibitions. Greenleaf began taking lessons from Katsura and was quickly smitten with her.

5|$|Four {{members of}} a Forward Observation Team from Battery C, 371st Field Artillery <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village when the Tank Destroyer unit withdrew.

5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy {{the last vestiges of}} these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings in the area around the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E

Police superintendent Kamal Singh Rathore said that this letter had been sent from Haridwar, that Rambhadracharya's security arrangements had been increased and that an intensive investigation of the letter had been carried out. Gita Devi, secretary of JRHU, said that Rambhadracharya had been threatened by al-Qaeda, as Ram Janmabhoomi Nyas president Nrityagopal <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past.|$|E
5|$|In casting Glee, Murphy {{sought out}} actors who could {{identify}} with the rush of starring in theatrical roles. Instead of using traditional network casting calls, he spent three months on Broadway, where he found Matthew Morrison, who had previously starred on stage in Hairspray and The Light in the Piazza; Lea Michele, who starred in Spring Awakening; and Jenna Ushkowitz, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Broadway revival of The King and I.|$|E

5|$|In the 1903 Tour de France, the {{organisation}} guaranteed {{that the first}} 50 cyclists in the final general classification would earn at least 5 francs per day. In 1904, if not more than 50 cyclists would finish, also cyclists who dropped out during the race would still get 5 francs for the days they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race. This rule was added to attract cyclists who otherwise would not enter, because the Tour needed enough competitors to remain credible.|$|E
5|$|Justice Hayne {{concluded}} that the detention scheme in the Migration Act did not contravene Chapter III because, fundamentally, it was not punitive. The Act did not make being in Australia without a visa an offence (although it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past), and in reality he considered the mandatory detention scheme to be not that different from {{a system in which}} all people were prevented from entering Australia without permission at all.|$|E

A big set-piece offensive played into his hands.|$|E
