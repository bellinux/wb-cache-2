The results elucidate the universal problem of foot pad dermatitis (FPD). Nearly 100 % of the observed turkeys showed a clinically apparent FPD at the meat processing plant. Furthermore, skin lesions of the breast, especially breast buttons were diagnosed, particularly at the slaughterhouse. FPD was detected {{in the first week of}} the rearing phase. Prevalence and degree showed a progressive development up to the age of 22 – 35 days, whereas 63. 3 % of the poults had foot pad alterations.

40|$|Skin {{samples of}} {{reticulate}} scales from the metatarsal and digital foot pads from heavy-breed Big 6 turkeys were macroscopically, light microscopically, histochemically, transmission and scanning electron microscopically {{as well as}} biochemically examined. Additionally, a field trial investigating the influence of variable, economically justifiable biotin levels on the devel-opment of foot pad lesions was conducted and statistically analysed. In its basic structures, the reticulate scale epidermis of <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys</b> is {{comparable to that of}} broilers. Nevertheless, the results presented here suggest that there are differences within the bird population and that an age dependent maturation of the skin as a whole occurred. The results on the epidermal lipid metabolism of the reticulate scales are contrary to any pre-vious investigation in birds and emphasises the need of further investigations of the mecha-nism and structure of the avian permeability barrier. Based on my results, the permeability barrier in turkeys is solely maintained by the interdigitation of glycolipids located within the lipid cell envelope of neighbouring sebocorneocytes. In birds these glycolipids originate from lipid bilayer residuals of the broken down multigranular bodies, rather than their limiting membrane as in mammals. The observed foot pad lesions are the consequence of a progressive inflammatory reaction. In severe cases an ulcer is formed. With increasing age these ulcers can heal, leaving visible scar tissue behind. The occurrence of foot pad lesions is associated with a decrease of epi-dermal &# 969; 6 -fatty acids and a change in the hydroxy fatty acid pattern. It was not possible to demonstrate an influence of the different biotin levels on the structure of the reticulate scales from the examined turkeys. An influence of biotin on the epidermal fatty acid pattern and the macroscopic evaluation of the foot health was detectable only in positive environmental conditions. None of the applied biotin levels compensated for the negative environmental influences or prevented the development of foot pad lesions. A posi-tive effect on the healing of existing foot pad lesions was detectable using high biotin levels in the last seven weeks of fattening. The skin from the various turkeys examined had an indi-vidually varying affinity to develop foot pad lesions and also, a genetic factor cannot be ex-cluded. Consequently, exclusion of affected chicks from the breeding program should be considered. Avoiding a decrease of biotin levels during the last seven fattening weeks under optimal envi-ronmental conditions seems advisable to improve foot health in male <b>fattening</b> <b>turkeys.</b> With-out a doubt, foot pad lesions are an issue concerning animal welfare and should attract more attention. <br /...|$|R

This paper examines the sources of export growth in Turkey. For this purpose, the study decomposes Turkey’s export growth into extensive and intensive margins by using two methodologies, the count method and the decomposition method of export growth shares. The intensive margin into price and quantity components is further decomposed in order to evaluate the role of changes in price and changes in quantity. Detailed bilateral trade data, BACI, from CEPII are employed to analyze Turkey’s export statistics with 209 countries at the HS- 6 level over the period 1998 – 2011. Additionally, these methods are employed for different categories of goods (final goods and intermediate goods exports). The results suggest that the extensive margin, particularly geographic diversification, plays the most important role in <b>Turkey’s</b> <b>total</b> goods export growth. Further, the growth in <b>Turkey’s</b> <b>total</b> goods exports is mainly explained by quantity rather than price growth. The results further point out that growth in Turkey’s final goods was driven by price growth, whereas growth in intermediate goods exports was mainly explained by quantity growth. Yet the results also suggested that product and geographic diversification of Turkey’s exports have not been materialized at all so that opportunities to expand product range or expand into new markets will bring significant benefits in the form of stable, sustainable economic growth. ...|$|R
