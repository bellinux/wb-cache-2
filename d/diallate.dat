50|$|Diisopropylamine is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} precursor to two herbicides, <b>diallate</b> and triallate, as well as certain sulfenamides used in the vulcanization of rubber. It {{is also used to}} prepare N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (Hünig's base) by alkylation with diethyl sulfate.|$|E
40|$|Sicklepod (Cassia obtusifolia L.) leaflet epicuticular fatty acid, fatty alcohol, and {{hydrocarbon}} contents {{were measured}} by gas-liquid chromatography from plants grown under 10 -, 12 -, 14 -, or 16 -hour photoperiods and treated with S-(2, 3 -dichloroallyl) diisopropylthiocarbamate (<b>diallate)</b> (0, 0. 14, 0. 28, 0. 56, 1. 12 kilograms per hectare). As <b>diallate</b> concentration increased, epicuticular fatty acid content decreased. Fatty alcohol content was maximal in plants treated with 0. 28 kilograms per hectare <b>diallate</b> and was reduced from that level at herbicide concentrations {{above or below}} this rate. Hydrocarbon content patterns {{were similar to those}} of the fatty alcohols except that the hydrocarbons at 0. 28 kilograms per hectare were 61 % of that present in the control, whereas the concentration of fatty alcohols increased to 200 % of the control in treatments of 0. 28 kilograms per hectare <b>diallate...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} several carbamates and trichloroacetic acid on the {{biosynthesis}} of epicuticular lipids from leaves of pea (Pisum sativum) was tested by chemical and visual methods. The carbamates tested included S-(2, 3 -dichloroallyl) diisopropylthiocarbamate (<b>diallate),</b> N-(3 -chlorophenyl) isopropylcarbamate (chloropropham), S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate, and 2 -chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate. <b>Diallate</b> reduced epicuticular lipids by 50 % when the plants were root-treated and by 80 % when vapor-treated. These results {{were supported by}} scanning electron microscopy and carbon replica techniques with transmission electron microscopy. The ratio of wax lipid components in the diallate-treated plants remained unchanged, {{with the exception of}} the primary alcohols, which were reduced. <b>Diallate</b> appears to interfere with the biosynthesis of a precursor to the elongation-decarboxylation pathway of lipid synthesis. N-(3 -Chlorophenyl) isopropylcarbamate had no significant effect on total amounts of extractable epicuticular lipids, nor did it alter the structure of the wax formation on the leaves. The scanning electron microscopy micrographs indicated that S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate significantly reduced wax formation on pea leaves. 2 -Chloroallyl diethyldithiocarbamate altered the structure of the wax formations, but not the total amount of wax (scanning electron microscopy). Trichloroacetic acid had little effect on wax deposition compared to <b>diallate</b> or S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate (scanning electron microscopy). The implication of the effect of the carbamates on epicuticular lipids and penetration of subsequent topically applied chemicals is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} thiocarbamates (S-ethyldipropylthiocarbamate and <b>diallate),</b> {{substituted}} ureas (monuron and diuron), and uracils (bromacil and terbacil) on lipid metabolism in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea) leaves was investigated under nonphotosynthetic conditions. The uptake of [1 - 14 C]acetate by leaf disks was inhibited by the thiocarbamates and marginally by the substituted ureas, {{but not by}} the uracil herbicides. The uptake of [methyl- 14 C]choline was inhibited {{to a lesser extent}} by thiocarbamates, while the other herbicides showed a slight stimulation. The thiocarbamates almost completely inhibited uptake of [32 P]orthophosphate at 1. 0 mM concentration, while diuron and terbacil showed significant inhibition. [1 - 14 C]Acetate incorporation into lipids was inhibited only by <b>diallate.</b> [methyl- 14 C]Choline incorporation into the choline phosphoglycerides was inhibited by <b>diallate,</b> diuron, and bromacil. The incorporation of [32 P]orthophosphate into phospholipids was substantially inhibited (over 90 % at 1. 0 mM) by the thiocarbamates, but not by the other herbicides. [35 S]Sulfate incorporation into sulfoquinovosyl diglycerides was markedly inhibited only by the thiocarbamates. Fatty acid synthesis by isolated chloroplasts was inhibited 40 – 85 % by thiocarbamates, substituted ureas, and bromacil, but not by terbacil. The inhibitory effect of the urea derivatives was reversible, but that of thiocarbamates was irreversible. sn-Glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase(s) of the chloroplast and microsomal fractions were profoundly inhibited by thiocarbamates, but not by the other two groups of herbicides. Phosphatidic acid phosphatase was insensitive to all the herbicides tested...|$|E
40|$|The {{herbicides}} trifluralin (α,α,α-trifluoro- 2, 6 -dinitro-N, N-dipropyl-p-toluidine) and <b>diallate</b> (S-[2, 3 -dichloroallyl] diisopropylthiocarbamate) inhibit electron transport, ATP synthesis, and cytochrome f reduction by isolated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) chloroplasts. Both compounds inhibit noncyclic electron transport from H 2 O to ferricyanide {{more than}} 90 % in coupled chloroplasts at concentrations less than 50 μm. Neither herbicide inhibits electron transport in assays utilizing only photosystem I activity, and the photosystem II reaction elicited by addition of oxidized p-phenylenediamine or 2, 5 -dimethylquinone is only partially inhibited by herbicide concentrations which block electron flow from H 2 O to ferricyanide. Inhibition of ATP synthesis parallels inhibition of electron flow in all noncyclic assay systems, and cyclic ATP synthesis catalyzed by either diaminodurene or phenazine metho-sulfate {{is susceptible to}} inhibition by both herbicides. These results indicate that trifluralin and <b>diallate</b> both inhibit electron flow in isolated chloroplasts {{at a point in}} the electron transport chain between the two photosystems...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the ability}} of various {{chemicals}} to be biotransformed into mutagens by plant cells was investigated. Two thiocarbamate herbicides, <b>diallate</b> and triallate, the sulfonylurea herbicide chlorsulfuron, and the aniline derivative m-phenylenediamine were tested {{for their ability to}} revert Salmonella typhimurium (strains TA 100 and TA 98) in the presence and absence of Nicotiana tabacum (TX 1) cell cultures in liquid suspension. Chlorsulfuron and m-phenylenediamine were also tested in the presence and absence of Brassica napus cv. 'Topas' cells. <b>Diallate</b> was found to be activated by TX 1 cells into a mutagen that induces base-pair substitution mutations. In the presence of the TX 1 plant cell line, chlorsulfuron significantly increased the number of mutations on the strain TA 98 of Salmonella. Tobacco TX 1 cells did not activate triallate into a mutagen. m-Phenylenediamine was activated into a mutagen by TX 1 and Brassica cells as detected by Salmonella TA 98. This aniline derivative, in the absence of plant cells and at concentrations higher than 20 $ mu$ Moles/plate, was also able to significantly increase the number of TA 98 revertants as compared to the control plants. Finally, Brassica napus cells activated chlorsulfuron into a mutagen that induces frameshift mutations...|$|E
