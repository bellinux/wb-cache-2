5|$|Peregrine falcon {{recovery}} teams breed {{the species}} in captivity. The chicks are usually fed through a chute {{or with a}} hand puppet mimicking a peregrine's <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> they cannot see to imprint on the human trainers. Then, when they are old enough, the rearing box is opened, allowing the bird to train its wings. As the fledgling gets stronger, feeding is reduced, forcing the bird to learn to hunt. This procedure is called hacking back to the wild. To release a captive-bred falcon, the bird is placed in a special cage {{at the top of}} a tower or cliff ledge for some days or so, allowing it to acclimate itself to its future environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{porpoise}} eye {{is relatively}} small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, {{the eyes of a}} porpoise are placed on the sides of its <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When porpoises surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; their eyes contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light. Porpoises do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most porpoises have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, they are able to form a very clear image of the surrounding area.|$|E
5|$|On June 30, 1959, Musial was {{the batter}} {{in one of}} the oddest plays in {{baseball}} history. In a game between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs, he was at the plate with a count of 3–1. Bob Anderson's next pitch was errant, evading catcher Sammy Taylor and rolling {{all the way to the}} backstop. Umpire Vic Delmore called ball four, even as Anderson and Taylor contended that Musial had foul tipped the ball. Because the ball was still in play and Delmore was embroiled in an argument with the catcher and pitcher, Musial kept running in attempt to make second base. Seeing that Musial was trying for second, Alvin Dark ran to the backstop to retrieve the ball. The ball wound up in the hands of field announcer Pat Pieper, but Dark ended up getting it back anyway. Absentmindedly, however, Delmore pulled out a new ball and gave it to Taylor. Anderson finally noticed that Musial was trying for second, took the new ball, and threw it to second baseman Tony Taylor. Anderson's throw flew over Taylor's head into the outfield. Dark, at the same time that Anderson threw the new ball, threw the original ball to shortstop Ernie Banks. Musial did not see Dark's throw and only noticed Anderson's ball fly over the second baseman's <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> he tried to go to third base. On his way there, he was tagged by Banks, and after a delay he was ruled out.|$|E

25|$|Side on: {{the back}} foot is {{parallel}} to the bowling crease causing the hips to be side on. The non-bowling arm is positioned in front of <b>head</b> <b>so</b> causing the shoulders to align with the hips. A classic example of a side on bowler is Dennis Lillee.|$|E
25|$|In the {{balanced}} action system, a spring or hydraulic cylinder {{is used to}} balance the tension on the <b>head</b> <b>so</b> the pedal will stay in position and the head will stay at pitch.

25|$|The {{alternate}} {{version of}} this myth is that after cutting off one head he then dipped his sword in its neck and used its venom to burn each <b>head</b> <b>so</b> it could not grow back. Hera, upset that Heracles had slain the beast she raised to kill him, placed it in the dark blue vault of the sky as the constellation Hydra. She then turned the crab into the constellation Cancer.|$|E

Around the ovoid solid of her head and across her breast and hand the light is diffused {{in such a way that}} the distance and position of the light in relation to the figure can be calculated.|$|E

25|$|There was {{a concern}} of Meinhof {{supporters}} about the forensic surgeons chosen {{by the state to}} perform the autopsy. Mallach (NSDAP Member No. 9154986) {{had been a member of}} the SS. He served in World War II as corporal in a Panzer division. In 1977, he made (without approval) and kept for a long time the death masks of Andreas Baader, Gudrun Ensslin and Jan-Carl Raspe. Professor Rauschke was the one who also performed the autopsy of Siegfried Hausner one year earlier and was accused by fellows and supporters of the RAF for ignoring the injuries to Hausner's <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> as to cover up the true cause of his death.|$|E
25|$|For the raid, police wore masks {{to hinder}} identification. Most {{occupants}} of the building were in their sleeping bags, and many raised their arms in surrender when they realised the police were breaking into the building. However, police attacked the crowds with truncheons, beating everyone indiscriminately. A 65-year-old woman's arm was broken. Melanie Jonasch, a 28-year-old archaeology student from Berlin, was attacked by officers set upon her, beating her <b>head</b> <b>so</b> hard that she rapidly lost consciousness. When she fell to the ground, officers circled her, beating and kicking her limp body, banging her head against a nearby cupboard, leaving her {{in a pool of}} blood.|$|E
25|$|One {{analysis}} of the fight gives credit to either Holliday or Morgan Earp for firing the fatal shot at McLaury on Fremont Street. Holliday may have been on McLaury's right and Morgan Earp on his left. McLaury {{was shot in the}} right side of the <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> Holliday is often given credit for shooting him. However, Wyatt Earp had shot McLaury in his torso earlier, a shot that alone could have killed him. McLaury would have turned away after having been hit and Wyatt could have placed a second shot in his head. A 30-day-long preliminary hearing found that the Earps and Holliday had acted within their duties as lawmen, although this did not pacify Ike Clanton.|$|E

25|$|Other {{less common}} and more {{cultural}} or national forms of niqab include the Afghan style burqa, a long pleated gown that {{extends from the}} head to the feet with a small crocheted grille over the face. The Pak Chador {{is a relatively new}} style from Pakistan, which consists of a large triangular scarf with two additional pieces. A thin band on one edge is tied behind the <b>head</b> <b>so</b> as to keep the chador on, and then another larger rectangular piece is attached to one end of the triangle and is worn over the face, and the simple hijāb wrapped, pinned or tied in a certain way so as to cover the wearer's face.|$|E
25|$|Geckos, skinks, {{and other}} lizards that are {{captured}} by the tail will shed part of the tail structure through a process called autotomy and thus be able to flee. The detached tail will continue to wiggle, creating a deceptive sense of continued struggle and distracting the predator's attention from the fleeing prey animal. The detached tails of leopard geckos can wiggle for up to 20 minutes. In many species the tails are of a separate and dramatically more intense color {{than the rest of}} the body so as to encourage potential predators to strike for the tail first. In the shingleback skink and some species of geckos, the tail is short and broad and resembles the <b>head,</b> <b>so</b> that the predators may attack it rather than the more vulnerable front part.|$|E
25|$|The {{methods of}} {{clearing}} differ between the half mask, which covers {{the eyes and}} nose, and the full-face mask, which also covers the mouth. If the mask has a purge valve and the strap tension is correct, the diver holds the <b>head</b> <b>so</b> that the valve is at the lowest point and exhales through the nose. If the mask is a good fit on the diver's face and the strap is correctly placed, exhaling through the nose will usually drive water out along the bottom edge of the skirt. It {{may be necessary to}} press {{the upper part of the}} mask against the face to improve the seal if the diver is rolled to one side. If the fit is not perfect, or the strap is too low, contact pressure of the top edge against the forehead may be insufficient to maintain a seal when the head is upright.|$|E

500|$|Damage to the {{accessory}} nerve (XI) {{will lead to}} ipsilateral weakness in the trapezius muscle. This can be tested by asking the subject to raise their shoulders or shrug, upon which the shoulder blade (scapula) will protrude into a winged position. [...] Additionally, if the nerve is damaged, weakness or an inability to elevate the scapula may be present because the levator scapulae muscle is now solely able to provide this function. Depending on {{the location of the}} lesion there may also be weakness present in the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which acts to turn the <b>head</b> <b>so</b> that the face points to the opposite side.|$|E
