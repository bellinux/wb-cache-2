5|$|Abrahams Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can occur when the creek floods over Eighth Street. There is a flood protection project for the creek in West Wyoming. This protection is capable of withstanding 100 year floods. The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hollow</b> to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E
5|$|The entire {{watershed}} of Abrahams Creek, {{including all}} of the streams and wetlands, has been significantly modified by both historical and modern land uses in the area. The natural surface water hydrology of the watershed was substantially modified by projects of the United States Army Corps of Engineers and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection from the 1950s until the 1990s. The sediment retention structure <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hollow</b> was constructed in the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Using {{a mass of}} examples, Thompson {{pointed out}} {{correlations}} between biological forms and mechanical phenomena. He showed the similarity in the forms of jellyfish and the forms of drops of liquid falling into viscous fluid, and between the internal supporting structures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> bones of birds and well-known engineering truss designs. He described phyllotaxis (numerical relationships between spiral structures in plants) {{and its relationship to}} the Fibonacci sequence.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and birds}} {{associated}} with C.australis include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among {{the leaves of}} the tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests in the base of an old cabbage tree {{standing in the middle of}} a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the discoveries}} of Richard's remains in 2012, {{it was decided}} that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite {{feelings}} in some quarters that he should have been reburied in York Minster. His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and the Most Reverend Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. The British Royal Family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a distant relation of the king and later portrayed him <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hollow</b> Crown television series, read a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.|$|E

5|$|Lesser yellow-headed {{vultures}} do {{not build}} nests, but rather lay eggs on the ground, cliff ledges, the floors of caves, or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> of a tree. Eggs are cream colored and heavily blotched with brown and gray spots, particularly around the larger end. Two eggs are generally laid. The chicks are altricial—they are blind, naked and relatively immobile upon hatching. The chicks do not grow their down feathers until later. The parents feed their young by regurgitating pre-digested food into their beak, where the chicks then drink it. Young fledge after {{two to three}} months.|$|E
5|$|Obsidian is an action-adventure {{presented}} in two dimensions, spread across approximately 50 game screens. Locations contrast between spaceship interior and rock surfaces. Players control a jet pack wearing astronaut who must deactivate the five engines of the titular spacestation Obsidian, {{which is located}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> centre carved out of an asteroid. Objects are stored in gravity boxes on the station's ceilings, only one object can be held at a time. These are used to solve the game's puzzles and allow the player to continue further into the game. Each object's purpose must be discovered as they are not labelled.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 1935 at 6:43pm, a {{custodial}} engineer {{called the}} Salem Fire Department to report smoke. Citizens helped to remove {{items from the}} smoky building, but when firefighters arrived, they ordered everyone to leave the structure, which was soon engulfed in flame. Among the helping citizens was twelve-year-old Mark Hatfield, who later became governor. It was determined the fire started {{in the basement of}} the east wing and quickly spread to piles of old records. A strong updraft <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> columns enclosing the dome's eight supporting steel lattice girders pulled the flames through the rotunda to upper stories. The intense heat burned even the copper dome and lit the night sky.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{primarily}} featuring new characters, <b>The</b> <b>Hollowing</b> is {{a sequel}} to Lavondyss because a handful of characters provide {{a link between the}} two novels. <b>The</b> events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previous novel set into motion the events that drive the actions of <b>the</b> protagonist <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hollowing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Additionally, the {{blossoms}} from the marri {{can be used}} as a source of honey, which can be sucked directly from the flower or can be dipped into water to make a sweet drink. These blossoms also attract ngoowak (bees) and honey can be found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> of eucalyptus branches. These trees also attract birds which nest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> branch <b>hollows,</b> <b>in</b> which eggs can be found to eat.|$|R

5|$|The scenes at Baskerville were filmed at {{a number}} of locations. The {{exterior}} was filmed at the gas works by Baverstocks near Llwydcoed in Mid Glamorgan. The labs meanwhile were filmed in two separate locations, one of which was a microchip processing facility. The switch between two locations meant that the crew had to transport a lift set. The scenes in Dewer's Hollow, where the hound was sighted, was filmed near Castell Coch. The reveal scenes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> took two nights to film. At some point filming the scenes were delayed due to rain. The scenes shot in Dartmoor took place in areas such as Haytor and Hound Tor, the latter of which was said to be where the original story was set.|$|E
5|$|Khambatta also faced {{difficulties}} during filming. Due to the actress' personal objections, {{she would}} not appear nude as {{called for in the}} script during the Ilia probe's appearance. The producers got her to agree to wear a thin skin-colored body stocking, but she caught a cold {{as a result of the}} shower mist, created by dropping dry ice into warm water and funneling the vapors into the shower by a hidden tube. Khambatta had to leave the location repeatedly to avoid hypercapnia. One scene required the Ilia probe to slice through a steel door in the sickbay; doors made out of paper, corrugated cardboard covered in aluminum foil, and cork were tested before the proper effect was reached. The illuminated button <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> of the probe's throat was a 12–volt light bulb that Khambatta could turn on and off via hidden wires; the bulb's heat eventually caused a slight burn.|$|E
5|$|Parsons {{was anxious}} {{to learn about the}} {{condition}} of his family and property at Wappocomo; he also needed an additional change of clothing and a blanket. Accompanied by Lieutenant Blue and Adam Parrish, he traveled west along the Northwestern Turnpike to around Pleasant Dale, then followed a series of roads and paths until nighttime, when they reached Sugar Hollow two miles north of Romney. Parsons stayed behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow,</b> while Blue and Parrish started out for Wappocomo to retrieve a set of Parsons' clothes. Knowing that the Union Army kept a 24-hour guard at the main house, Blue circled around {{to the rear of the}} mansion and knocked on the window of his uncle, Garrett W. Blue, who was residing with the Parsons family. Garrett Blue warned his nephew about the Union Army soldiers possibly stationed on the home's front porch, and he subsequently fetched Parsons' daughter, Kate, who provided Lt. Blue with a parcel for her father.|$|E
50|$|Japanese gimlet (kiri 錐). The kiri is {{used for}} boring {{circular}} holes in a timber, often as <b>the</b> first stage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollowing</b> out of a mortise. Though seemingly simple to use, the kiri is commonly {{considered one of the}} most difficult tools to master.|$|R
50|$|Jarrah is an {{important}} element in its ecology, providing numerous habitats for animal life - especially birds and bees - while it is alive, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> that form as the heartwood decays. When it falls, it provides shelter to ground-dwellers such as the chuditch (Dasyurus geoffroii), a carnivorous marsupial.|$|R

5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow.</b> Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still to grow a little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E
25|$|In Rabbit Hollow, {{through which}} Ackerly Creek flows, there are {{numerous}} bird species, including Louisiana waterthrush, Cooper's hawk, wood thrush, swamp sparrow, pileated woodpecker, belted kingfisher, red-winged blackbird, and gray catbird. Mammals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> include rabbits, woodchucks, chipmunks, squirrels, and white-tailed deer.|$|E
25|$|After the war, {{interest}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> pit {{design was}} revived. Its obvious {{advantage is that}} a hollow shell of plutonium, shock-deformed and driven inward toward its empty center, would carry momentum into its violent assembly as a solid sphere. It would be self-tamping, requiring a smaller U-238 tamper, no aluminium pusher and less high explosive.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple algorithm for hollowing out a solid CAD model. The algorithm employs voxel elements to do <b>the</b> <b>hollowing.</b> Instead of performing three-dimensional Boolean operations on the solid CAD model, one-dimensional Boolean operations between the ray {{representations of the}} model and voxel elements are carried out. The ray representation of <b>the</b> <b>hollowed</b> model <b>in</b> turn, produces <b>the</b> direct slice files as output to the rapid prototyping machine. In order to satisfy strength considerations, square and honeycomb structures are formed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollowed</b> object. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

50|$|According to {{the author}} the work is {{influenced}} by Tennyson's Idylls of the King and Joseph Campbell's The Masks of God. The theme {{of the novel is}} 'the stealing of power.' The story provides a locale that ties <b>in</b> with <b>the</b> past experiences of Harry Keeton in Mythago Wood and echoes the story of Arnauld Lacan <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hollowing.</b>|$|R
25|$|Nepenthes bicalcarata {{provides}} space <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollow</b> {{tendrils of}} its upper pitchers for the carpenter ant Camponotus schmitzi to build nests.

50|$|As for the Epiphyllinae subtribe, {{these species}} {{are not easily}} {{recognised}} as cacti. They are all epiphytes, absorbing moisture through their aerial roots, and grow <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hollows</b> of trees <b>in</b> tropical forests. <b>The</b> stems develop many branches with very small, spineless areoles. The segments are generally either cylindrical, angular, or flat. The principal genera are Lepismium and Rhipsalis.|$|R
5|$|Around 56% of eggs lead to {{successful}} fledging of young, with fieldwork in northeastern Victoria yielding {{an average of}} 2.77 young leaving the nest.
