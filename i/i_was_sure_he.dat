60|$|I said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would {{increase}} the speed, if there was trade enough to justify it.|$|E
60|$|I {{thought of}} Governor Sharpe's biting words to Grafton. The Governor knew my uncle well, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had never {{sat at his}} Council.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} I {{wondered}} {{he was not}} ashamed of such a conversion, supposing he made it, which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would not, {{as long as my}} brother retained his senses.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. P. Yes, {{such as that}} dreary, languid, pale, bald, cadaverous, leering man {{whispered to}} me. Oh, how I dislike him! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> unkind to his wife. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> has a bad temper; {{and if there is}} any excuse for---- ...|$|R
60|$|EDSTASTON. Come! <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{really loved}} you; and you truly loved him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's a {{thousand}} pities {{he should have}} ever been removed from Devonport, where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> both useful and ornamental.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mercy, how you rush {{about in}} this temperature!' his mother exclaimed, while I {{reflected}} that it was perhaps his billiard-balls I had heard ten minutes before. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was fond of billiards.|$|E
6000|$|... "He does what's a {{thousand}} times better--he lets it alone. He does," [...] Maggie went on, [...] "as he would do; as I see now that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would. He lets me alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mercy, how you rush {{about in}} this temperature!" [...] the poor lady exclaimed while I {{reflected}} that it was perhaps his billiard-balls I had heard ten minutes before. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> was fond of billiards.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{the patient}} <b>is</b> too ill, <b>I</b> tell you. He wouldn't {{understand}} you, probably. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> couldn't answer your questions." ...|$|R
6000|$|Fisc. I'll {{call him}} in; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> will <b>be</b> proud, at any rate, to redeem your kind opinion of him. [...] [Exit.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you,' Averil answered, {{playing with}} her heavy jet watch-guard. 'You are very good; but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> could not move so soon.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{far as you}} know!" [...] The Detective's {{words were}} smooth enough, but his manner was so {{exasperating}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> had some motive in it; so I waited in silence. He went on: ...|$|E
60|$|In {{front of}} a {{glittering}} hotel a friend of mine, a critic, was climbing from a cab. He seemed at leisure; and I put my question to him. He answered me conscientiously, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he swore}} so fervently by his Christ that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would never break the oath. After he had sworn I {{told him how}} I could not rest because of the strange fears which oppressed me.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! thank you, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> glad. You know poor Owen has {{nowhere to}} go, since his uncle has behaved so shamefully.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> has money: why {{the first}} class, yesterday, otherwise. And I'm sure she married {{him because he}} is a {{townsman}} with property.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it cannot be. It {{would be}} plain treachery to your parents; Mr. Fellowes would say so. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would not marry us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Said not a word, but I saw {{his lips}} tremble {{and his eyes}} shine and I knew he was the happiest {{creature}} there, because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> did think you fit to be his wife and did mean to speak very soon." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{considerably}} alarmed by what Tony Dibble had said. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{would not have}} spoken had there not been good cause. If I {{had not been so}} interested in {{what was going on in}} the cabin I would have gone on deck at once.|$|E
60|$|By {{the stamp}} upon the letter sheet, I saw that Mr. Nottington was a solicitor, and this made my mind revert to Mr. Ira Mason. As I have said, the lawyer {{had taken an}} {{interest}} in me, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would now give me the best advice in his power.|$|E
5000|$|Newly {{appointed}} {{head coach}} Ian Millward commented: [...] "Kevin is still only 20 {{and a very}} exciting player. He is still improving and as he gets better, which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> will, he {{will be an important}} part of our attack." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No {{disparagement}} to the captain, only <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so dreadfully {{afraid of}} him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> thinks me such an unmitigated goose. Now, doesn't he?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Alaric {{wants to}} do all he can to ingratiate himself with Uncle Bat,' said Gertrude; 'and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he's</b> going {{the right way to}} work,' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} the game well enough, though I pretended I did not, and played cautiously. It {{was to keep}} a good stock in my lap, out of which I {{every now and then}} conveyed some into my pocket, but in such a manner, and at such convenient times, as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> could not see it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{would agree}} with me," [...] said her ladyship, [...] "when he learned what sort of person she is. I know I had only to explain;"--and then she plumed her feathers, and was very gracious; for to tell the truth, Lady Lufton {{did not like to}} be opposed in things which {{concerned}} the parish nearly.|$|E
60|$|Once {{upon a time}} I found a ten-cent {{magazine}} {{lying on}} a bench in a little city park. Anyhow, that was the amount he asked me for when I sat on the bench next to him. He was a musty, dingy, and tattered magazine, with some queer stories bound in him, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>He</b> {{turned out to be a}} scrap-book.|$|E
6000|$|... "None of the particulars, no. But Fetjen {{could tell}} you, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure.</b> <b>He</b> knew this {{one-armed}} Spark quite well. Often told {{stories about the}} captain." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me as if he {{wondered}} who on earth <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> saw my soul in my face and trusted me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father was not home, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> {{would not}} have {{prevented}} me if he had been. Father has no hard feelings against you, Uncle Richard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, sir, all well. Bob {{has turned}} out a great help to my father. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would do well {{when he got the}} chance. Of course, so long as I was there he had not much responsibility, but I could see then that he would make a good farmer. Things have been going on just as well as when I was at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{suffering}} neither {{from one}} or the other. But there is a most valuable ring lying out in the garden. Will you send for it?" [...] Then of course the story had to be told. [...] "You will, I hope, understand how I came to ask for it foolishly. It was {{because it was the}} one thing which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would not give away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so moved, your Excellency, {{at these}} people's story that I took [...] {{the liberty of}} {{promising}} them, {{in the name of}} the Congo Free State, [...] that you will only kill them in future for crimes. I told them the [...] Inspector Royal was, I hoped, on his way, and that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> would [...] listen to their story, and give them time to recover themselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{had given}} up the billiard-table," [...] Frank said. [...] "He promised me {{that he would not}} go there any more, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> wouldn't." ...|$|R
60|$|I think <b>he</b> swore, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> groaned distressfully when I {{went out}} with what was due to me. Meeting Harry I told him the story.|$|R
6000|$|There was a moment's pause before Dorothy answered. [...] "I will shew you his letter;--though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>sure</b> <b>he</b> didn't {{mean that}} I should shew it to anyone." ...|$|R
