I n the second experiment, white, green, and yellow electroluminescent and red incandescent light were compared in terms of legibility of a transillumi-wted lettermuity chart. Exposure to red incandescent lighting at 0. 05 f t. 4 produced the lowest absolutq and acuity thresholds, with white and green electroluminescent producing higher thresholds in that order. Although threshold differences between lighting colors were statistically significant. the absolute differences in visual sensitivity were small for practical purposes.

40|$|Dunaliella bardawil, a halotolerant green alga, was {{previously}} shown to accumulate {{high concentrations of}} β-carotene when grown outdoors under defined conditions. The β-carotene of algae cultivated under high light intensity in media containing a high salt concentration is composed of approximately 50 % all-trans β-carotene and 40 % 9 -cis β-carotene. We show here that the 9 -cis to all-trans ratio {{is proportional to the}} <b>integral</b> <b>light</b> intensity to which the algae are exposed during a division cycle. In cells grown under a continuous white light of 2000 microeinsteins per square meter per second, the ratio reached a value of around 1. 5, while in cells grown under a light intensity of 50 microeinsteins per square meter per second, the ratio was around 0. 2. As previously shown, algae treated with the herbicide norflurazon accumulate phytoene in place of β-carotene. Electron micrographs showed that the phytoene is accumulated in many distinct globules located in the interthylakoid spaces of the chloroplast. Here too, two isomers are present, apparently all-trans and 9 -cis phytoene, and their ratio is dependent upon the <b>integral</b> <b>light</b> intensity to which the algae are exposed during a division cycle. In the presence of norflurazon, Dunaliella bardawil grown under a light intensity of 2000 microeinsteins per square meter per second contained about 8 % phytoene with a 9 -cis to all-trans ratio of about 1. 0. This ratio decreased to about 0. 1 when the light intensity was reduced to 50 microeinsteins per square meter per second. These data suggest that the isomerization reaction which leads to the production of the 9 -cis isomer occurs early in the path of carotene biosynthesis, at or before the formation of all-trans phytoene. The presence of the 9 -cis isomer of β-carotene and the dependence of its preponderance on light intensity seem to be a common feature of many plant parts. Thus carrots which are exposed to minimal light contain no 9 -cis isomer while sun-exposed leaves, fruits, and flowers contain 20 to 50 % of the 9 -cis isomer...|$|R

40|$|Commercial {{protected}} {{cultivation of}} shade-tolerant pot-plants in The Netherlands has expanded enormously {{in the last}} decade. Typically, very low daily <b>light</b> <b>integrals</b> are applied (3 - 5 mol PAR m- 2 day- 1), which are achieved by use of heavy screening and application of a layer of chalk (CaCO 3) {{on the outside of}} the greenhouse to increase reflection of incoming irradiance. Although these low daily <b>light</b> <b>integrals</b> are meant to avoid damage by high light intensities and/or high temperatures, it is clear that they carry a production penalty, since potential crop growth is directly related to the amount of light that can be captured and efficiently used. Additionally, it remains unclear whether current daily <b>light</b> <b>integrals</b> are too conservative, which would create room for optimisation. Recently, a number of experiments have been carried out to examine the possibilities and limitations for cultivation of several shade-tolerant pot-plants at higher daily <b>light</b> <b>integrals.</b> For most species, plants could be grown faster when more light was allowed. Also, a significant reduction in energy use for heating could be achieved if more natural irradiance was allowed to enter the greenhouse.

40|$|Whilst {{juvenile}} during vegetative growth, {{plants are}} incapable of initiating flowering when grown under floral inductive conditions. Understanding juvenility is important since it influences flowering time, which in turn impacts on scheduling of crop production. Daily <b>light</b> <b>integral</b> (DLI or LI) is the total photosynthetically active radiation received in one day and is calculated from light intensity and light period (Korczynski et al., 2002). It {{is one of the}} factors that could regulate juvenility. The project aims are to determine the effect of <b>light</b> <b>integral</b> on (i) phase development, (ii) photosynthetic assimilation and partitioning in relation to juvenility, (iii) the expression of key flowering time genes, including FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and (iv) the expression of microRNA 156 in relation to juvenility. Transfer experiments have been carried out to generate material differing in juvenility length for molecular and biochemical analyses. These utilised antirrhinum plants grown under different <b>light</b> <b>integrals</b> and Arabidopsis mutants defective in specific carbohydrate related genes. cDNAs representing genes involved in starch synthesis (PHOSPHOGLUCOMUTASE(PGM), PHOSPHOGLUCOISOMERASE(PGI), SUCROSE PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE(SPS)) and degradation (STARCH EXCESS 1 (SEX- 1), BETA AMYLASE 3 (BAM- 3), ALPHA AMYLASE(AMY)) have been isolated from antirrhinum plants. Antirrhinum plants grown under reduced <b>light</b> <b>integrals</b> had extended juvenile and adult vegetative phases and reduced levels of AmFT, AmPGM, AmPGI, AmSEX- 1, and AmBAM- 3 during juvenility. Juvenility was shown to be extended in mutants defective in both starch synthesis and starch degradation. This indicates that <b>light</b> <b>integral</b> influences the time plants need to accumulate enough level of carbohydrate to support phase change and levels of oligosaccharide, released during starch degradation, may influence the length of juvenility. Consistently, in both Arabidopsis and antirrhinum, the timing of FT induction was shown to correlate with the end of juvenility and interestingly, <b>light</b> <b>integral</b> has a greater effect on AmFT induction and phase transition than photoperiod.

It was found that the extinction theorem and Maxwell's equations remain valid even in such conditions. A striking contradiction with the energy conservation law arising with allowance of the radiation damping effect into the Lorentz-Lorenz formula is resolved by means of a proper account of the discreteness of the medium.
