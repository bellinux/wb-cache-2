40|$|Objective: Conceptualization of the {{physical}} objects and spaces that constitute the human body at the macroscopic level of organization, specified as a machine-parseable ontology which, in its human-readable form, is comprehensible to both expert and novice users of anatomical information. Design: Conceived as an anatomical enhancement of the UMLS Semantic Network and Metathesaurus, the anatomical ontology was formulated by specifying defining attributes and differentia for classes and subclasses of physical anatomical entities based on their partitive and spatial relationships. The validity of the classification was assessed by instantiating the ontology for the thorax. Several transitive relationships were used for symbolically modeling aspects of {{the physical}} organization of the thorax. Results: By declaring Organ as the macroscopic organizational unit of the <b>body,</b> <b>and</b> defining the <b>entities</b> that constitute organs <b>and</b> higher level <b>entities</b> constituted by organs, all anatomical entities could be {{assigned to one of}} three top level classes (Anatomical structure, Anatomical spatial <b>entity</b> <b>and</b> <b>Body</b> substance). The ontology accommodates both the systemic and regional (topographical) views of anatomy, as well as diverse clinical naming conventions of anatomical entities. Conclusions: The ontology formulated for the thorax is extendible to microscopic and cellular levels, as well as to other body parts, in that its classes subsume essentially all anatomical entities that constitute the body. Explicit definitions of these <b>entities</b> <b>and</b> their relationships provide the first requirement for standards in anatomical concept representation. Conceived from an anatomical view point, the ontology can be generalized and mapped to other biomedical domains and problem solving tasks that require anatomical knowledge...|$|R

To improve prediction of VTE in cancer patients, {{we performed a}} prospective and observational cohort study of pa-tients with newly diagnosed cancer or progression of disease after remission. A previously developed risk scoring model for prediction of VTE that in-cluded clinical (tumor <b>entity</b> <b>and</b> <b>body</b> mass index) <b>and</b> laboratory (hemoglo-bin level and thrombocyte and leuko-cyte count) parameters was expanded by incorporating 2 biomarkers, soluble P-selectin, and D-Dimer. Of 819 patients 61 (7. 4 %) experienced VTE during a median follow-up of 656 days. The cumu-lative VTE probability in the original risk model after 6 months was 17. 7 % in patients with the highest risk score (> 3, n 93), 9. 6 % in those with score 2 (n 221), 3. 8 % in those with score 1 (n 229), and 1. 5 % in those with score 0 (n 276). In the expanded risk model, the cumulative VTE probability after 6 months in patients with the highest score (> 5, n 30) was 35. 0 % and 10. 3 % in those with an intermediate score (score 3, n 130) as opposed to only 1. 0 % in patients with score 0 (n 200); the hazard ratio of patients with the highest compared with those with the lowest score was 25. 9 (8. 0 - 84. 6). Clini-cal and standard laboratory parameters with addition of biomarkers enable pre-diction of VTE and allow identification of cancer patients at high or low risk of VTE.

40|$|The article {{examines}} the issues of social protection of internally displaced people as a new subject of social-security law. The legal foundations with regard to these individuals are on their way, under development. Ukraine’s law On the Rights and Freedoms of Internally Displaced People is established as the initial indicator that this subject is becoming recognised as a field of social-security law – specifically, internally displaced people and determining legal regulation. This law presents a definition of ‘internally displaced people’, presents a compilation of their rights and obligations, determines {{the legal status of}} such people, provides guarantees of social protection, and addresses related matters. Nonetheless, several issues still require legal regulation. The authors conclude that, for the qualitative improvement of legal regulation of the status of IDPs and their social protection, there must be complex interaction within both legal science <b>and</b> legislative <b>entities</b> <b>and</b> that <b>bodies</b> with special competence in this field must be established to engage in dialogue with civil and international organisations...|$|R

Influencing {{national and}} international policies {{with a view to}} reduce poverty is not only carried out by the Dutch Minister for Development Co-operation but also by private development organizations via the Dutch Co-Financing Programme. The main aim of this programme is to reduce poverty in a sustainable way; its core philosophy is that poverty alleviation without strengthening civil society and without changing policies that sustain or aggravate poverty, makes no sense. Hence influencing policies is one of the three intervention strategies of the Dutch Co-Financing Programme. The five dilemma's relate to the following tension: on the one hand these organizations have to show to the Minister for Development Co-operation and Dutch Parliament to what extent the annual budget of 50 million euro's for policy influencing has been spent effectively; on the other hand {{they have to deal with}} the complexities of policy processes and with lobby targets (government <b>entities</b> <b>and</b> corporate <b>bodies)</b> that are reluctant or resistant to changing their policies...|$|R

Clinical notes from a Swedish emergency unit were annotated and used for evaluating a rule- <b>and</b> terminology-based <b>entity</b> recognition system. This system used different preprocessing techniques for matching terms to SNOMED CT, and, one by one, four other terminologies were added. For the class body structure, the results improved with preprocessing, whereas only small improvements were shown for the classes disorder and finding. The best average results were achieved when all terminologies were used together. The entity body structure was recognised with a precision of 0. 74 and a recall of 0. 80, whereas lower results were achieved for disorder (precision: 0. 75, recall: 0. 55) and for finding (precision: 0. 57, recall: 0. 30). The proportion of entities containing abbreviations were higher for false negatives than for correctly recognised <b>entities,</b> <b>and</b> no <b>entities</b> containing more than two tokens were recognised by the system.

Many types and forms of decentralisation have been implemented in Africa since the colonial period, {{with varying degrees of}} success. This paper explores the process of forest management decentralisation conducted in Cameroon since the mid- 1990 s, highlighting its foundations and characterising its initial assets. Through the transfer of powers to peripheral actors for the management of forestry fees, Council Forests and Community [or Village] Forests, this policy innovation could be empowering and productive. However, careful observation and analysis of relationships between the central state <b>and</b> regional/local-level decentralised <b>bodies,</b> on the one hand, and of the circulation of powers, on the other, show – after a decade of implementation – that the experiment is increasingly governed by strong tendencies towards ‘re-centralisation’, dictated by the practices of bureaucrats and state representatives. The paper also confirms recent empirical studies of ‘the capture of decentralised actors’. It finally shows how bureaucrats and state authorities are haunted by the Frankenstein's monster syndrome, concerning state–local relationships in decentralised forest management...|$|R

We adopt domain specific IE patterns to extract potentially relevant <b>entity</b> <b>and</b> relation instances from documents, and develop a number of document ranking strategies using the extracted instances to address this extraction task.
