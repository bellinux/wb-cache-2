50|$|The {{integration}} process was difficult due to disparate network technologies. Sprint tried {{to address this}} {{with the advent of}} PowerSource phones.

5000|$|Some {{researchers}} {{suggest that}} Oswald {{was an active}} agent of the Central Intelligence Agency, often pointing {{to the fact that}} he attempted to defect to Russia but was nonetheless able to return without difficulty (even receiving a repatriation loan from the State Department) as evidence of such. A former roommate of Oswald, James Botelho (who would later become a California judge) stated in an interview with Mark Lane that he believed that Oswald was involved in an intelligence assignment in Russia, although Botelho made no mention of those suspicions in his testimony to the Warren Commission years earlier. Oswald's mother, Marguerite, often insisted that her son was recruited by an agency of the U.S. Government and sent to Russia. New Orleans District Attorney (and later judge) Jim Garrison, who in 1967 brought Clay Shaw to trial for the assassination of President Kennedy also held the opinion that Oswald was most likely a CIA agent who had been drawn into the plot to be used as a scapegoat, even going as far as to say that Oswald [...] "genuinely was probably a hero". Senator Richard Schweiker, a member of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence remarked that [...] "everywhere you look with Oswald, there're fingerprints of intelligence".

50|$|In 1978, the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) Board of Directors {{commissioned}} the public television “system planning project” {{to consider the}} most appropriate organization of national service functions for public television for the 1980s. Among the concerns was the feeling of many that insulation of programing from representational responsibilities, and the more effective conduct of both the operating functions of the national program service and the system planning and representation functions for the licensees, {{would be better served}} if the two functions were not the responsibility of a single organization and management. The planning project concurred with this view, and after a process of consultation with the PBS membership and other agencies, concluded with this recommendation to the PBS Board. At the PBS Annual Meeting in Los Angeles in June 1979, the membership voted unanimously to endorse the establishment of a new “center for public television planning and representation” separate from PBS, and the reorganization of PBS to provide multiple program services. On November 1, 1979, Articles of Incorporation for the Association for Public Broadcasting were filed in the District of Columbia. On November 27, the PBS Board reviewed the work of its Committee and endorsed the formation of the Association. The Association’s Interim Board of Trustees, at its organizational meeting the same day, adopted By-Laws for the new organization. In December and January, the great majority of the public television licensees accepted the Board’s invitation to become Members of the Association, and voted overwhelmingly to approve the By-Laws. The Association began operations on January 1, 1980, with an <b>interim</b> <b>staff</b> and with transitional financial support and staff assistance provided by PBS. The Association’s first full president, Dr. David Carley of Madison, Wisconsin, began in mid-May, and at that time, more than 90 percent of the station licensees had elected to become Members of the Association, and had designated more than 300 lay and professional representatives to serve as charter members of its Board of Delegates. In nationwide mail balloting, the Delegates elected Trustees to oversee the management of the Association’s affairs, and the Trustees called the First Annual Meeting of the Board of Delegates for June 2, 1980, in Washington, D.C.|$|E

Wilcott and his wife, Elsie (also a former employee of the CIA) later repeated those claims in a story by the San Francisco Chronicle. Despite its official policy of neither confirming nor denying the status of agents, both the CIA itself and many officers working in the region at the time (including David Atlee Phillips) have [...] "unofficially" [...] dismissed the plausibility of any possible ties to Oswald and the agency. Robert Blakey, staff director and chief counsel for the U.S. House Select Committee on Assassinations supported that assessment in his conclusions as well.|$|E
