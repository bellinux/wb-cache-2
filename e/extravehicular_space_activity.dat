40|$|INTRODUCTION: Repeated {{altitude}} exposures in {{a single}} day occur during special operations parachute training, hypobaric chamber training, unpressurized flight, and <b>extravehicular</b> <b>space</b> <b>activity.</b> Inconsistent and contradictory information exists regarding the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) during such hypobaric exposures. HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesized that four short exposures to altitude with and without ground intervals would result in a lower incidence of DCS than a single exposure of equal duration. METHODS: The 32 subjects were exposed to 3 different hypobaric exposures [...] condition A: 2 h continuous exposure (control); condition B: four 30 -min exposures with descent/ascent but no ground interval between the exposures; condition C: four 30 -min exposures with descent/ascent and 60 min of ground interval breathing air between exposures. All exposures were to 25, 000 ft with 100 % oxygen breathing. Subjects were observed for symptoms of DCS, and precordial monitoring of venous gas emboli (VGE) was accomplished with a SONOS 1000 echo-imaging system. RESULTS: DCS occurred in 19 subjects during A (mean onset 70 +/- 29 min), 7 subjects in B (60 +/- 34 min), and 2 subjects in C (40 +/- 18 min). There was a significant difference in DCS incidence between B and A (p = 0. 0015) and C and A (p = 0. 0002), but no significant difference between B and C. There were 28 cases of VGE in A (mean onset 30 +/- 23 min), 21 in B (41 +/- 35 min), and 21 in C (41 +/- 32 min) with a significant onset curve difference between B and A and between C and A, but not between B and C. Exposure A resulted in four cases of serious respiratory/neurological symptoms, while B had one and C had none. All symptoms resolved during recompression to ground level. CONCLUSION: Data indicate that repeated simulated altitude exposures to 25, 000 ft significantly reduce DCS and VGE incidence compared with a single continuous altitude exposure...|$|E

40|$|Over {{the history}} of human {{expansion}} into <b>space,</b> <b>extravehicular</b> <b>activity</b> (EVA) has become indispensable for both daily living in weightlessness and for further space exploration. The physiological factors involved {{in the performance of}} extensive EVA, necessary for construction and maintenance of the International Space Station and during future human interplanetary missions, require further examination. An understanding of the physiological aspects of exercise and thermoregulation in the EVA environment will help to insure the health, safety, and efficiency of working astronauts. To that end, this review will focus on the interaction of the exercise and environmental aspects of EVA, as well as exercise during spaceflight and ground-based simulations such as bed-rest deconditioning. It will examine inflight exercise thermoregulation, and exercise, muscular strength, supine vs. seated exercise, exercise thermoregulation, and exercise in a hypobaric environment. Due to the paucity of data from controlled human research in this area, it is clear that more scientific studies are needed to insure safe and efficient extravehicular activity...|$|R

In a balanced, two-period, crossover trial, 39 healthy individuals were each exposed twice, without denitrogenation, to an altitude of 6400 m in a hypobaric chamber. Under the experimental condition, subjects exercised at their predetermined anaerobic threshold levels for 30 min each day for 3 d prior to altitude exposure; the other condition was a non-exercise control. Under both conditions, subjects performed exercise simulating <b>space</b> <b>extravehicular</b> <b>activities</b> at altitude for a period of 3 h, while breathing 100 percent oxygen. There were nine preferences (untied responses) for DCS, four under control and five under experimental conditions; all were Type I, pain-only bends. No carry-over effects between exposures was detected, and the test for treatment differences showed p = 0. 56 for symptoms. No significant difference in DCS preferences was found after subjects exercised up to their anaerobic threshold levels during the days prior to decompression...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the many}} {{challenges}} that the Mars environment poses for EVA (<b>extravehicular</b> <b>activity)</b> <b>space</b> suit designers, {{development of an}} appropriate thermal insulation {{is one of the}} most important. The latest in thermal insulation technologies that could be applied or modified for planetary exploration have been reviewed. These include porous and hollow structures, phase change materials, soluble gas elements, as well as vacuum enclosures and fibrous materials. Using current technology, none of these structures offers all of the features needed for Mars exploration, namely lightweight, low bulk, high flexibility, and low thermal insulation. Nonwoven fibrous materials are still the prime design candidates because they are more flexible than other structures while having good resiliency. They are usually safe to use. They are also available in many types of materials, fiber shapes, as well as fabric densities and constructions. However, a recent study conducted at the NASA Johnson Space Center shows clearly that these structures alone are not sufficient to provide effective thermal insulation in the harsh Mars environment. A more promising solution is being developed using aerogel fillers in the nonwoven structures...|$|R
40|$|Solar hard X-ray flares can expose astronauts on lunar {{and deep}} <b>space</b> <b>extravehicular</b> <b>activities</b> (EVAs) to {{dangerous}} acute biological doses. We combine calculations of radiative transfer through shielding materials with subsequent transfer through tissue {{to show that}} hazardous doses, taken as >= 0. 1 Gy, should occur with a probability of about 10 % per 100 hours of accumulated EVA inside current spacesuits. The rapid onset and short duration of X-ray flares {{and the lack of}} viable precursor events require strategies for quick retreat, in contrast to solar proton events, which usually take hours to deliver significant fluence and can often be anticipated by flares or other light-speed precursors. Our results contrast with the view that only particle radiation poses dangers for human space exploration. Heavy-element shields provide the most efficient protection from X-ray flares, since X-rays produce no significant secondary radiation. We calculate doses due to X-ray flares behind aluminum shields and estimate the required shield masses to accompany EVA rovers. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figures; to be published in Space Weathe...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{characterize}} the symptoms and injuries experienced by NASA astronauts during <b>extravehicular</b> <b>activity</b> (<b>space</b> walk) spacesuit training at the Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory at Ellington Field, Houston, Texas. We identified the frequency and incidence rates of symptoms by each general body location and characterized mechanisms of injury and effective countermeasures. Based on these findings a comprehensive list of recommendations was made to improve training, test preparation, and current spacesuit components, and to design the next -generation spacesuit. At completion of each test event a comprehensive questionnaire was produced that documented suit symptom comments, identified mechanisms of injury, and recommended countermeasures. As we completed our study we found that most extravehicular mobility unit suit symptoms were mild, self-limited, and controlled by available countermeasures. Some symptoms represented the potential for significant injury with short- and long-term consequences regarding astronaut health and interference with mission objectives. The location of symptoms and injuries that were most clinically significant was in the hands, shoulders, and feet. Correction of suit symptoms issues will require a multidisciplinary approach to improve prevention, early medical intervention, astronaut training, test planning, and suit engineering...|$|R

40|$|William J RoweFormer Assistant Clinical Professor of Medicine, Medical University of Ohio at Toledo, Ohio, USAAbstract: The {{hypothesis}} underpinning {{this paper}} is that space flight may predispose to catecholamine cardiomyopathy. Catecholamine levels in space are twice those of the supine levels on Earth. Serum magnesium levels are significantly reduced, with potential vicious cycles triggered by elevation of catecholamines. These are conducive to coronary vasospasm with clot formation from oxidative stress and calcium overload, and ultimately, temporary impairment of left ventricular function could occur. Experimental animals in space have shown {{a significant increase in}} norepinephrine levels with various microcirculatory disorders and serious myocardial pathology. During <b>extravehicular</b> <b>activity</b> (<b>space</b> walks), astronauts show heart rates of 150 – 174 beats per minute. Before exposure to the iron-laden dust brought into the habitat on his space suit, Neil Armstrong&# 39;s heart rates on the lunar surface were 130 – 160 beats per minute, and accompanied by dyspnea on two occasions during his last 20 minutes on the moon. A stress test done on the day after splashdown was consistent with "ischemic left ventricular dysfunction". To support this hypothesis, echocardiography on the international space station might show left ventricular hypokinesia. Alpha adrenergic blockade, correction of invariable significant magnesium deficits, along with correction of invariable atrial natriuretic peptide deficits, may counteract the vasoconstrictive action of norepinephrine.

40|$|NASA's Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission (ARCM) is {{challenged}} with primary mission objectives of demonstrating deep <b>space</b> <b>Extravehicular</b> <b>Activity</b> (EVA) and tools, and obtaining asteroid samples {{to return to}} Earth for further study. Although the Modified Advanced Crew Escape Suit (MACES) {{is used for the}} EVAs, it has limited mobility which increases fatigue and decreases the crews' capability to perform EVA tasks. Furthermore, previous Shuttle and International Space Station (ISS) spacewalks have benefited from EVA interfaces which have been designed and manufactured on Earth. Rigid structurally mounted handrails, and tools with customized interfaces and restraints optimize EVA performance. For ARCM, some vehicle interfaces and tools can leverage heritage designs and experience. However, when the crew ventures onto an asteroid capture bag to explore the asteroid and collect rock samples, EVA complexity increases due to the uncertainty of the asteroid properties. The variability of rock size, shape and composition, as well as bunching of the fabric bag will complicate EVA translation, tool restraint and body stabilization. The unknown asteroid hardness and brittleness will complicate tool use. The rock surface will introduce added safety concerns for cut gloves and debris control. Feasible solutions to meet ARCM EVA objectives were identified using experience gained during Apollo, Shuttle, and ISS EVAs, terrestrial mountaineering practices, NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) 16 mission, and during Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory testing in the MACES suit. The proposed concept utilizes expandable booms and integrated features of the asteroid capture bag to position and restrain the crew at the asteroid worksite. These methods enable the capability to perform both finesse, and high load tasks necessary to collect samples for scientific characterization of the asteroid. This paper will explore the design trade space and options that were examined for EVA, the overall concept for the EVAs including translation paths and body restraint methods, potential tools used to extract the samples, design implications for the Asteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV) for EVA, the results of early development testing of potential EVA tasks, and extensibility of the EVA architecture to NASA's exploration missions...|$|R
