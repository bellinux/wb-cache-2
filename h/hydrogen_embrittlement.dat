5|$|Cadmium electroplating, {{consuming}} 6% of {{the global}} production, {{is used in the}} aircraft industry to reduce corrosion of steel components. This coating is passivated by chromate salts. A limitation of cadmium plating is <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement</b> of high-strength steels from the electroplating process. Therefore, steel parts heat-treated to tensile strength above 1300 MPa (200 ksi) should be coated by an alternative method (such as special low-embrittlement cadmium electroplating processes or physical vapor deposition).|$|E
5|$|The {{interactions}} of hydrogen with various metals {{are very important}} in metallurgy, as many metals can suffer <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> and in developing safe ways to store it {{for use as a}} fuel. Hydrogen is highly soluble in many compounds composed of rare earth metals and transition metals and can be dissolved in both crystalline and amorphous metals. Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the metal crystal lattice.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{copper-nickel}} alloys were fabricated, notched tensile specimens machined for each alloy, and the specimens tested in 34. 5 MPa hydrogen and in air. A notched tensile ratio was determined for each alloy and the <b>hydrogen</b> environment <b>embrittlement</b> (HEE) determined for the alloys of 47. 7 weight percent nickel to 73. 5 weight percent nickel. Stacking fault probability and stacking fault energies were determined for each alloy using the x ray diffraction line shift and line profiles technique. <b>Hydrogen</b> environment <b>embrittlement</b> {{was determined to}} be influenced by stacking fault energies; however, the correlation is believed to be indirect and only partially responsible for the HEE behavior of these alloys...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} grain size on the {{susceptibility}} of high-strength {{low alloy steels}} to <b>hydrogen</b> environment <b>embrittlement</b> in a 45 MPa gaseous hydrogen atmosphere was examined in term of the hydrogen content penetrating the specimen during the deformation. Notch tensile tests were performed in a 45 MPa hydrogen environment using specimens with different prior austenite grain size numbers varying from 2. 5 to 5. 4. The hydrogen content was measured by thermal desorption analysis with a quadrupole mass spectrometer {{before and after the}} tensile test. The fracture stress of the notch tensile test increased with increasing grain size number; this showed that grain refinement was effective in reducing the susceptibility of the specimens to <b>hydrogen</b> environment <b>embrittlement</b> in a high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere. The addition of nickel did not affect the fracture stress. A remarkable increase in the content of diffusive hydrogen was observed after the notch tensile test. Assuming that part of the diffusive hydrogen desorbed from grain boundaries, it can be inferred that grain refinement can reduce the mass of hydrogen in the unit grain boundary area, and the susceptibility to high-pressure <b>hydrogen</b> environment <b>embrittlement.</b> [doi: 10. 2320 /matertrans.

5|$|Hydrogen poses {{a number}} of hazards to human safety, from {{potential}} detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure, oxygen-free form. In addition, liquid hydrogen is a cryogen and presents dangers (such as frostbite) associated with very cold liquids. Hydrogen dissolves in many metals, and, in addition to leaking out, may have adverse effects on them, such as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> leading to cracks and explosions. Hydrogen gas leaking into external air may spontaneously ignite. Moreover, hydrogen fire, while being extremely hot, is almost invisible, and thus can lead to accidental burns.|$|E
5|$|Argon is also {{commonly}} {{mixed with}} other gases, oxygen, helium, hydrogen and nitrogen. The addition {{of up to}} 5% oxygen (like the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide mentioned above) {{can be helpful in}} welding stainless steel, however, in most applications carbon dioxide is preferred. Increased oxygen makes the shielding gas oxidize the electrode, which can lead to porosity in the deposit if the electrode does not contain sufficient deoxidizers. Excessive oxygen, especially when used in application for which it is not prescribed, can lead to brittleness in the heat affected zone. Argon-helium mixtures are extremely inert, and can be used on nonferrous materials. A helium concentration of 50–75% raises the required voltage and increases the heat in the arc, due to helium's higher ionization temperature. Hydrogen is sometimes added to argon in small concentrations (up to about 5%) for welding nickel and thick stainless steel workpieces. In higher concentrations (up to 25% hydrogen), it may be used for welding conductive materials such as copper. However, it should not be used on steel, aluminum or magnesium because it can cause porosity and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} the process {{is its ability to}} overcome <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement</b> problems, which is important for workpieces that have a hardness greater than HRC 40. Note that there still is some embrittlement of the workpiece. While this process does not cause problems with <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> and electroplating does, it still offers equivalent corrosion protection. There is a great cost savings in using mechanical plating over electroplating on hardened workpieces, because the electroplating processes requires a pre- and post-plating operation to overcome <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement</b> problems. Moreover, because mechanical plating occurs at room temperature there is no tempering of hardened workpieces.|$|E

25|$|Electrolytic-tough pitch (ETP) copper, a high-purity copper that {{contains}} oxygen as an alloying agent, represents {{the bulk of}} electrical conductor applications because of its high electrical conductivity and improved annealability. ETP copper is used for power transmission, power distribution, and telecommunications. Common applications include building wire, motor windings, electrical cables, and busbars. Oxygen-free coppers are used to resist <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement</b> when extensive amounts of cold work is needed, and for applications requiring higher ductility (e.g., telecommunications cable). When <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement</b> is a concern and low electrical resistivity is not required, phosphorus may be added to copper.|$|E

25|$|Hydrogen {{pipelines}} {{are more}} expensive than even long-distance electric lines. Hydrogen is about three times bulkier in volume than natural gas for the same enthalpy. Hydrogen accelerates the cracking of steel (<b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement),</b> which increases maintenance costs, leakage rates, and material costs. The difference in cost is likely to expand with newer technology: wires suspended in air can use higher voltage with only marginally increased material costs, but higher pressure pipes require proportionally more material.|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen has a clean {{flame and}} {{is good for}} use on aluminium. It can be used at a higher {{pressure}} than acetylene and is therefore useful for underwater welding and cutting. It is a good type of flame to use when heating large amounts of material. The flame temperature is high, about 2,000°C for hydrogen gas in air at atmospheric pressure, and up to 2800°C when pre-mixed in a 2:1 ratio with pure oxygen (oxyhydrogen). Hydrogen is not used for welding steels and other ferrous materials, because it causes <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hydrogen {{and other}} {{elements}} within iron act as softening agents that promote the movement of dislocations that naturally exist in the iron atom crystal lattices. Varying the amount of alloying elements—their formation in the iron hydride either as solute elements, or as precipitated phases—enables the movement of those dislocations that make iron so ductile and weak, and thus controls qualities such as the hardness, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting iron hydride. Iron hydride's ductility compared to pure iron is only possible {{at the expense of}} strength, of which elemental iron has a relative deficiency. However, iron hydride is metastable and subject to the rapid formation of a precipitated phase of gaseous dihydrogen, a process known as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> Thus, the material properties of iron hydride are time-sensitive. One alloying element intentionally added to modify the characteristics of iron hydride is titanium.|$|E

25|$|Three inch (7.5cm) {{diameter}} bolts connect {{portions of}} the bridge deck mounting bosses to several concrete columns. There are 288 such bolts of various lengths. The bolts were tested in place by overtightening their retaining nuts. In the two weeks subsequent to this tightening, 30 of the first 96 bolts loaded failed. These bolts vary in length from 9 to 17 feet and failure was initially attributed to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement,</b> with hydrogen introduced during either manufacturing or electroplating. Some of the bolts can be replaced while others cannot be removed and load transfer will require more complex remediation methods. Repairs were initially not expected to delay the opening, but later it was believed it would delay the opening until December. The fix could cost up to five million dollars. A temporary fix was announced on August 15, 2013, with the opening revised back to its original date. The solution selected was to add a tendon-secured saddle at each deck boss location. It was suggested internally that issues with tensioning the main cable {{may have led to}} the bolt failures.|$|E
25|$|Pressurized water reactor (PWR) fuel {{consists}} of cylindrical rods put into bundles. A uranium oxide ceramic is formed into pellets and inserted into Zircaloy tubes that are bundled together. The Zircaloy tubes are about 1cm in diameter, and the fuel cladding gap {{is filled with}} helium gas to improve the conduction of heat from the fuel to the cladding. There are about 179-264 fuel rods per fuel bundle and about 121 to 193 fuel bundles are loaded into a reactor core. Generally, the fuel bundles consist of fuel rods bundled 14×14 to 17×17. PWR fuel bundles are about 4 meters long. In PWR fuel bundles, control rods are inserted through the top directly into the fuel bundle. The fuel bundles usually are enriched several percent in 235U. The uranium oxide is dried before inserting into the tubes to try to eliminate moisture in the ceramic fuel {{that can lead to}} corrosion and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement.</b> The Zircaloy tubes are pressurized with helium to try to minimize pellet-cladding interaction which can lead to fuel rod failure over long periods.|$|E
25|$|During a meltdown, the {{temperature}} of the fuel rods increases and they can deform, in the case of Zircaloy cladding, above 700–900°C (1,292-1,652 °F). If the reactor pressure is low, the pressure inside the fuel rods ruptures the control rod cladding. High-pressure conditions push the cladding onto the fuel pellets, promoting formation of uranium dioxide–zirconium eutectic with a melting point of 1200–1400°C (2,192-2,552 °F). An exothermic reaction occurs between steam and zirconium, which may produce enough heat to be self-sustaining without the contribution of decay heat from radioactivity. Hydrogen is released in an amount of about 0.5m3 (17.65 cu. ft.) of hydrogen (at normal temperature/pressure) per kilogram of zircaloy oxidized. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>embrittlement</b> may also occur in the reactor materials and volatile fission products can be released from damaged fuel rods. Between 1300 and 1500°C (2,372-2,732 °F), the silver-indium-cadmium alloy of control rods melts, together with the evaporation of control rod cladding. At 1800°C (3,272 °F), the cladding oxides melt and begin to flow. At 2700–2800°C (4,892-5,072 °F) the uranium oxide fuel rods melt and the reactor core structure and geometry collapses. This can occur at lower temperatures if a eutectic uranium oxide-zirconium composition is formed. At that point, the corium is virtually free of volatile constituents that are not chemically bound, resulting in correspondingly lower heat production (by about 25%) as the volatile isotopes relocate.|$|E

40|$|After {{about two}} years of {{operation}} the surface crack examination of cylindrical pressure vessel (PV) for liquid ammonia revealed fine surface cracks. They were exclusively located in the weld material of the longitudinal and circumferential joints performed by the submerged arc welding process. For {{the construction of the}} PV the fine grained structural steel St E 355 as base metal and S 2 Mo wire as filler metal were used. The cracks were oriented mainly transverse to the welding direction and their appearance seemed to be typical for ammonia induced stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Because of the low operating stress level and the steel-relief heat treatment of the whole PV, X-ray residual stress measurements (XRSM) were performed in order to decide whether SCC was possible or not. As a result of the XRSM and additional investigations it was shown that the measured residual stresses were repsonsible for crack growth by the SCC mechanism. Crack initiation was caused by <b>hydrogen</b> induced <b>embrittlement</b> (cold cracking) because the welding was performed at an interpass temperature that was too low...|$|R

40|$|Structural {{defects in}} {{materials}} such as vacancies, grain boundaries, and dislocations may trap hydrogen and a local accumulation of hydrogen at these defects {{can lead to the}} degradation of the materials properties. An important aspect in obtaining insight into <b>hydrogen</b> induced <b>embrittlement</b> on the atomistic level is to understand the diffusion of hydrogen in these materials. In our study we employ kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations to investigate hydrogen diffusion in bcc iron within different microstructures. All input data to the kMC model, such as available sites, solution energies, and diffusion barriers are obtained from first-principles calculations. We find that hydrogen mainly diffuses within the interface region with an overall diffusivity that is lower than in pure bcc-Fe bulk. The concentration dependence of the diffusion coefficient is strongly non-linear and the diffusion coefficient may even decrease with increasing hydrogen concentration. To describe the macroscopic diffusion coefficient we derive an analytic expression as a function of hydrogen concentration and temperature which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results for idealised microstructures...|$|R
