5|$|FH is {{classified}} as a type 2 <b>familial</b> dyslipidemia. There are five types of <b>familial</b> dyslipidemia (not including subtypes), and each are classified from both the altered lipid profile and by the genetic abnormality. For example, high LDL (often due to LDL receptor defect) is type 2. Others include defects in chylomicron metabolism, triglyceride metabolism, and metabolism of other cholesterol-containing particles, such as VLDL and IDL.|$|E
5|$|<b>Familial</b> acanthocytosis with {{paroxysmal}} exertion-induced dyskinesias and epilepsy (FAPED).|$|E
5|$|Guepinia is {{variously}} {{classified in the}} Auriculariales order, with uncertain <b>familial</b> position (incertae sedis), {{or as part of}} the Exidiaceae family.|$|E
5|$|The genetic {{heritability}} of Alzheimer's disease (and memory components thereof), {{based on}} reviews of twin and family studies, ranges from 49% to 79%. Around 0.1% {{of the cases}} are <b>familial</b> forms of autosomal (not sex-linked) dominant inheritance, which have an onset before age 65. This form of the disease is known as early onset <b>familial</b> Alzheimer's disease. Most of autosomal dominant <b>familial</b> AD {{can be attributed to}} mutations in one of three genes: those encoding amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilins 1 and 2. Most mutations in the APP and presenilin genes increase the production of a small protein called Aβ42, which is the main component of senile plaques. Some of the mutations merely alter the ratio between Aβ42 and the other major forms—particularly Aβ40—without increasing Aβ42 levels.|$|E
5|$|Alirocumab and evolocumab, both {{monoclonal}} antibodies against PCSK9, {{are specifically}} indicated as adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy {{for the treatment}} of adults with heterozygous <b>familial</b> hypercholesterolemia, who require additional lowering of LDL cholesterol.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{pancreatitis}} {{appears to}} almost triple risk, and as with diabetes, new-onset pancreatitis {{may be a}} symptom of a tumor. The risk of pancreatic cancer in individuals with <b>familial</b> pancreatitis is particularly high.|$|E
5|$|<b>Familial</b> {{prion disease}} occurs in {{families}} with a mutation in the PrP gene, and mice with PrP mutations develop prion disease despite controlled conditions where transmission is prevented. These mice can then transmit {{the disease to}} healthy, wild type mice, suggesting that mice with PrP mutations spontaneously generate infectivity.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{mutations}} in cTnI {{have been found}} to cause cardiomyopathies. cTnI mutations account for approximately 5% of <b>familial</b> hypertrophic cardiomyopathy cases and to date, more than 20 myopathic mutations of cTnI have been characterized.|$|E
5|$|Other {{causes that}} can {{secondarily}} produce parkinsonism are stroke and drugs. Parkinson plus syndromes such as progressive supranuclear palsy and multiple system atrophy must be ruled out. Anti-Parkinson's medications are typically less effective at controlling symptoms in Parkinson plus syndromes. Faster progression rates, early cognitive dysfunction or postural instability, minimal tremor or symmetry at onset may indicate a Parkinson plus disease rather than PD itself. Genetic forms with an autosomal dominant or recessive pattern of inheritance are {{sometimes referred to}} as <b>familial</b> Parkinson's disease or <b>familial</b> parkinsonism.|$|E
5|$|Alice Howland, a {{linguistics}} {{professor at}} Columbia University, celebrates her 50th birthday with her physician husband John {{and their three}} adult children. After she forgets a word during a lecture and becomes lost during a jog on campus, Alice's doctor diagnoses her with early onset <b>familial</b> Alzheimer's disease. Alice's eldest daughter, Anna, and son, Tom, take a genetic test {{to find out if}} they will develop the disease. Alice's younger daughter Lydia, an aspiring actress, decides not to be tested.|$|E
5|$|FH {{needs to}} be {{distinguished}} from <b>familial</b> combined hyperlipidemia and polygenic hypercholesterolemia. Lipid levels {{and the presence of}} xanthomata can confirm the diagnosis. Sitosterolemia and cerebrotendineous xanthomatosis are two rare conditions that can also present with premature atherosclerosis and xanthomas. The latter condition can also involve neurological or psychiatric manifestations, cataracts, diarrhea and skeletal abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Gout {{is partly}} genetic, {{contributing}} to about 60% of variability in uric acid level. The SLC2A9, SLC22A12 and ABCG2 genes {{have been found}} to be commonly associated with gout and variations in them can approximately double the risk. Loss-of-function mutations in SLC2A9 and SLC22A12 cause hereditary hypouricaemia by reducing urate absorption and unopposed urate secretion. The rare genetic disorders <b>familial</b> juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, medullary cystic kidney disease, phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase superactivity and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency as seen in Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, are complicated by gout.|$|E
5|$|Hosseini has {{commented that}} he {{considers}} The Kite Runner to be a father–son story, emphasizing the <b>familial</b> {{aspects of the}} narrative, an element that he continued to use in his later works. Themes of guilt and redemption feature prominently in the novel, with a pivotal scene depicting an act of violence against Hassan that Amir fails to prevent. The {{latter half of the}} book centers on Amir's attempts to atone for this transgression by rescuing Hassan's son over two decades later.|$|E
5|$|Hosseini stated his {{intentions}} {{to make the}} characters more complex and morally ambiguous. Continuing the <b>familial</b> theme established in his previous novels, The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns, And the Mountains Echoed centers on the rapport between siblings. Besides Abdullah and Pari, Hosseini introduced two other sibling and sibling-like relationships—the children's stepmother Parwana and her disabled sister Masooma and an Afghan-American doctor named Idris and his cousin Timur.|$|E
5|$|Menkauhor ruled for {{possibly}} {{eight or}} nine years, following king Nyuserre Ini, and was succeeded in turn by Djedkare Isesi. Although Menkauhor is well attested by historical sources, few artifacts from his reign have survived. Consequently, his <b>familial</b> relation to his predecessor and successor is unclear, and no offspring of his have been identified. Khentkaus III may have been Menkauhor's mother, as indicated by evidence discovered in her tomb in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Minority Report {{presents}} {{a future of}} increasing electronic surveillance, personalized advertising, and it analyzes the role of media in a future state where electronic advancements make its presence nearly boundless, the potential legality of an infallible prosecutor, and Spielberg's repeated theme of the broken family. Spielberg's analysis of the <b>familial</b> aspect was motivated by his own parent's divorce {{when he was a}} child.|$|E
5|$|Research {{on early}} {{detection}} is ongoing. For instance, the European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and <b>Familial</b> Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) trial is aiming {{to determine whether}} regular screening is appropriate for people with {{a family history of}} the disease, or who have hereditary pancreatitis. The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and prevention if a workable screening strategy can be developed.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{pathogenic}} mutations {{have been}} identified in the prion-like domains of heterogeneous nuclear riboproteins hnRNPA2B1 and hnRNPA1 in <b>familial</b> cases of muscle, brain, bone and motor neuron degeneration. The wild-type form of all of these proteins show a tendency to self-assemble into amyloid fibrils, while the pathogenic mutations exacerbate this behaviour and lead to excess accumulation.|$|E
5|$|Soluble epoxide {{hydrolase}} (sEH) is a bifunctional {{enzyme that}} in humans is encoded by the EPHX2 gene. sEH {{is a member}} of the epoxide hydrolase family. This enzyme, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to specific epoxides and converts them to the corresponding diols. A different region of this protein also has lipid-phosphate phosphatase activity. Mutations in the EPHX2 gene have been associated with <b>familial</b> hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
5|$|Specifically, {{aggregation}} of TDP-43, an RNA-binding protein, {{has been}} found in ALS/MND patients, and mutations in the genes coding for these proteins have been identified in <b>familial</b> cases of ALS/MND. These mutations promote the misfolding of the proteins into a prion-like conformation. The misfolded form of TDP-43 forms cytoplasmic inclusions in afflicted neurons, and is found depleted in the nucleus. In addition to ALS/MND and FTLD-U, TDP-43 pathology is a feature of many cases of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. The misfolding of TDP-43 is largely directed by its prion-like domain. This domain is inherently prone to misfolding, while pathological mutations in TDP-43 have been found to increase this propensity to misfold, explaining the presence of these mutations in <b>familial</b> cases of ALS/MND. As in yeast, the prion-like domain of TDP-43 {{has been shown to be}} both necessary and sufficient for protein misfolding and aggregation.|$|E
5|$|Still Alice is a 2014 American {{independent}} drama film {{written and}} directed by Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland and based on Lisa Genova's 2007 bestselling novel of the same name. The film stars Julianne Moore as Alice Howland, a linguistics professor diagnosed with <b>familial</b> Alzheimer's disease shortly after her 50th birthday. Alec Baldwin plays her husband, John, and Kristen Stewart, Kate Bosworth and Hunter Parrish play her children, Lydia, Anna and Tom.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of neuroblastoma are often vague making diagnosis difficult. Fatigue, loss of appetite, fever, and joint pain are common. Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present: Germline mutations in the PHOX2A or KIF1B gene have {{been implicated in}} <b>familial</b> neuroblastoma as well. Neuroblastoma is also a feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 and the Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Though fibrofolliculomas {{are unique}} to Birt–Hogg–Dubé, they may present with an {{ambiguous}} appearance and must be confirmed histologically. Other diseases can mimic the dermatologic manifestations of BHD, including tuberous sclerosis complex, Cowden syndrome, <b>familial</b> trichoepitheliomas, and multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. Tuberous sclerosis must be distinguished because both disorders can present with angiofibromas on the face, though they are more common in tuberous sclerosis.|$|E
5|$|Title VIII of the Act, {{commonly}} known as the Fair Housing Act, prohibited discrimination in housing and housing-related transactions on the basis of race, religion, or national origin (later expanded to include sex, <b>familial</b> status, and disability). This legislation was seen as a tribute to King's struggle in his final years to combat residential discrimination in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|While visiting Ford's Theatre {{around noon}} {{to pick up}} his mail, Booth learned that Lincoln and Grant were to see Our American Cousin there that night. This {{provided}} him with an especially good opportunity to attack Lincoln since, having performed there several times, he knew the theater's layout and was <b>familial</b> to its staff.|$|E
5|$|Counseling and {{guidelines}} {{on the use}} of genetic testing for HD have become models for other genetic disorders, such as autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias. Presymptomatic testing for HD has also influenced testing for other illnesses with genetic variants such as polycystic kidney disease, <b>familial</b> Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. The European Molecular Genetics Quality Network have published yearly external quality assessment scheme for molecular genetic testing for this disease and have developed best practice guidelines for genetic testing for HD to assist in testing and reporting of results.|$|E
5|$|Family is {{the primary}} social and {{political}} grouping in Torajan society. Each village is one extended family, the seat {{of which is the}} tongkonan, a traditional Torajan house. Each tongkonan has a name, which becomes the name of the village. The <b>familial</b> dons maintain village unity. Marriage between distant cousins (fourth cousins and beyond) is a common practice that strengthens kinship. Toraja society prohibits marriage between close cousins (up to and including the third cousin)—except for nobles, to prevent the dispersal of property. Kinship is actively reciprocal, meaning that the extended family helps each other farm, share buffalo rituals, and pay off debts.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition <b>familial</b> periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in the genes coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E
5|$|Pericles {{was born}} c. 495 BC, in Athens, Greece. He {{was the son}} of the {{politician}} Xanthippus, who, though ostracized in 485–484 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at Mycale just five years later. Pericles' mother, Agariste, a member of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae, and her <b>familial</b> connections {{played a crucial role in}} helping start Xanthippus' political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of the tyrant of Sicyon, Cleisthenes, and the niece of the Athenian reformer Cleisthenes.|$|E
5|$|The bluespotted {{stingray}} {{was discovered}} by Heinrich Kuhl in Java, Indonesia. The population of this species is greatly debatable due to the five different species of rays in Indonesia. Also, {{there are two different}} subgroups: the Java and Bali form. The distinct difference between the two strains is their size, with the Bali being much larger than the Java. On the <b>familial</b> level, the family Dasyatidae is made up of 9 genera and 70 species. The genus of Neotrygon are called maskrays, because of the color pattern around their eyes.|$|E
5|$|The king, {{after getting}} {{suspicious}} of her actions, once {{followed her to}} a sadhu’s place, with a dagger in his cloak. Once he reached the ashram, he {{found that there was}} no one inside. To his surprise, both the sadhu and his daughter Champavati had vanished. When he was about to return, he heard a voice saying that his daughter had been taken away as a punishment of his suspicion. The voice also asked him to build a temple, on the name of his daughter Champavati, if he wanted to avoid further <b>familial</b> calamities.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} coffin of Thutmose I {{was taken}} over and re-used by a later pharaoh of the 21st dynasty. The mummy of Thutmose I {{was thought to be}} lost, but Egyptologist Gaston Maspero, largely on the strength of <b>familial</b> resemblance to the mummies of Thutmose II and Thutmose III, believed he had found his mummy in the otherwise unlabelled mummy #5283. This identification has been supported by subsequent examinations, revealing that the embalming techniques used came from the appropriate period of time, almost certainly after that of Ahmose I and made {{during the course of the}} Eighteenth dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with degenerative diseases has been well documented. These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between amyloid and degenerative diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in <b>familial</b> cases of degenerative disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E
5|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of R.palmatus {{have made it}} difficult for taxonomists to agree on how it should be classified, resulting in an elaborate taxonomical history and an extensive synonymy. First named Agaricus palmatus by Bulliard in 1785, it was reclassified into several different genera before becoming Rhodotus in 1926. The <b>familial</b> placement of the genus Rhodotus within the order Agaricales has also been subject to dispute, and the taxon has been transferred variously to the families Amanitaceae, Entolomataceae, and Tricholomataceae. More recently, molecular phylogenetics analysis has helped determine that Rhodotus is most closely related to genera in the Physalacriaceae.|$|E
5|$|Walter {{also helped}} with the {{creation}} of a more professional group of royal justices. Although the group, which included Simon of Pattishall, Ralph Foliot, Richard Barre, William de Warenne, Richard Herriard, and Walter's brother Osbert fitzHervey, had mostly already served as justices prior to Walter's term of office, it was Walter who used them extensively. It appears likely that Walter chose them for their ability, not for any <b>familial</b> ties to himself. This group of men replaced the previous system of using mostly local men, and are the first signs of a professional judiciary.|$|E
25|$|<b>Familial</b> {{renal disease}} is an {{uncommon}} cause of renal failure (kidney failure) in young dogs. Most causes are breed-related (<b>familial)</b> {{and some are}} inherited.|$|E
