5|$|The two {{starting}} quarterbacks {{combined for}} 31 incomplete passes, with the clock stopping on each <b>incompletion,</b> and the officials called 19 penalties, leading to more clock stoppages. Each team used {{all six of}} its allocated timeouts, and the many scores led to additional commercial breaks. At halftime, Connal called Cline, and without urgency discussed {{the fact that the}} game seemed to be running longer than expected.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Rodin was {{compared}} to Michelangelo, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era. In the three decades following his death, his popularity waned with changing aesthetic values. Since the 1950s, Rodin's reputation has re-ascended; he is recognized {{as the most important}} sculptor of the modern era, and {{has been the subject of}} much scholarly work. The sense of <b>incompletion</b> offered by some of his sculpture, such as The Walking Man, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|After a ten-yard gain by Richardson {{to start}} the quarter, Alabama lost a total of seven yards on {{consecutive}} plays and a McCarron <b>incompletion</b> on third down set up a third long field goal attempt. This time the 49-yard attempt from Jeremy Shelley was blocked by Bennie Logan and recovered by Eric Reid who returned it to the Alabama 48. On this LSU possession, Jordan Jefferson took over as the Tigers' quarterback, and LSU gained a first down on a six-yard Michael Ford run {{and a pair of}} short runs by Ware. However, the drive stalled again and Wing was forced to punt for LSU.|$|E

50|$|Anthony Morelli was 16 of 35 for 188 yards, {{with one}} {{touchdown}} and no interceptions. However, down 35-31 in the game's final minutes, Morelli threw four consecutive <b>incompletions</b> to end Penn State's last drive.|$|R
5|$|Alabama {{started from}} their own four, and Lacy had a short gain before Richardson had four {{consecutive}} runs to move {{the ball to the}} 39-yard line. The next play was Alabama's longest play from scrimmage in the game when McCarron threw a 39-yard pass to Richardson and brought the ball to the LSU 19-yard line. However, for the fourth time in four offensive possessions, the LSU defense held Alabama to a field goal attempt. This time, the 34-yard Jeremy Shelley kick was good and the Crimson Tide took a 3–0 lead. Once the received the kickoff, LSU began their fourth offensive possession {{from their own}} 24. The Tigers opened their drive with runs of 14 and nine yards from Ford, followed by short runs from Ware, Jefferson and Ford again to bring the ball to the Alabama 36. After a five yard substitution penalty, Jefferson completed a 34-yard pass to Russell Shepard to give the Tigers a first and goal from the Alabama eight. After a four-yard rush by Ford and a Jefferson <b>incompletion,</b> Dre Kirkpatrick was called for holding that resulted in a first and goal from the Alabama two-yard line. Jefferson then threw another <b>incompletion</b> followed with a run for no gain by Ford. LSU then called a time-out with two seconds left in the half to set up a field goal attempt, and Alabama followed with a second time-out in an attempt to ice the kicker. Drew Alleman then kicked a 19-yard field goal as time expired to tie the game at 3–3 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|Alabama {{started their}} second drive {{with a short}} gain and an <b>incompletion,</b> and then McCarron then threw a 19-yard pass to Maze for a first down. The Crimson Tide gained another pair of first downs with a Maze {{reception}} and three runs each from Richardson and Eddie Lacy before the drive stalled at the LSU 33. Again Foster missed a field goal, this time from 50-yards, and the game remained tied at zero. On the next LSU possession, Ware had a short gain and Lee completed a short pass to Russell Shepard before he threw an interception to Robert Lester at the Alabama 47-yard line. The Crimson Tide then began their third offensive series with a 19-yard completion from McCarron to Darius Hanks {{before the end of}} the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{had three}} quarterbacks on their roster {{entering}} the 1970 season in Gault, Bill Nelsen, and Mike Phipps. As training camp began, Browns coach Blanton Collier {{planned to use}} Gault in exhibition games, as he was throwing the ball well in practice during the summer. By the end of preseason, Gault {{was named to the}} active roster as the Browns retained all three quarterbacks, an uncommon move at the time. During the Browns' second game against the San Francisco 49ers, starting quarterback Nelsen was injured, leading Gault to enter the game in the fourth quarter. He completed a pass to Gary Collins for 23 yards, threw an <b>incompletion,</b> and threw an interception to Dave Wilcox, allowing the 49ers to go on a game-winning drive in a 34-31 Browns loss.|$|E
50|$|McCullough {{was named}} Ironman of the Game twice that season. The first time against Arizona, where he forced {{numerous}} <b>incompletions</b> and racked up 128 yards on offense. The second time was against Detroit, where he scored, had 64 yards and posted an interception.|$|R
50|$|The Raiders {{got back}} on track by {{crushing}} the Broncos 34-10. In the first quarter Brian Griese was intercepted by Rod Woodson for a 98-yard pick-six score and the Raiders never looked back. Rich Gannon had three touchdowns and only four <b>incompletions</b> of 38 throws for 352 yards.|$|R
50|$|Alabama took a 20-13 lead in {{the first}} {{overtime}} period when Sims connected with DeAndrew White on a six-yard touchdown reception. The Tigers were unable to respond on their overtime possession as four straight <b>incompletions</b> gave the Crimson Tide the 20-13 win. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Tigers to 49-25-5.|$|R
5|$|The <b>incompletion</b> on 3rd down {{stopped the}} clock with 2:11 {{left in the}} game. The field goal attempt was placed from 39 yards away, which is not {{considered}} a particularly difficult field goal distance by NFL standards. Because the game was played indoors at the Metrodome, there were no adverse weather conditions that might have affected the kick. The ball was snapped on 4th down with punter Mitch Berger holding. The Vikings faced a heavy rush from cornerback Michael Booker {{on the left side}} of the line of scrimmage and cornerbacks Ronnie Bradford and Ray Buchanan on the right, who ran into Anderson and knocked him to the ground after the kick. The ball sailed about a foot wide left of the upright with 2:07 left on the game clock. Afterward, Anderson stood with arms akimbo on the field momentarily before heading to the sideline, as Falcons players celebrated around him.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of punts to open the third quarter, LSU scored their first {{touchdown}} on a one-yard Jeremy Hill run that cut the Alabama lead to 14–10. On the kickoff that ensued, a failed onside kick gave the Crimson Tide possession at the Tigers' 44-yard line. The drive stalled at the 10-yard line when a Yeldon fumble was recovered by Sam Montgomery. LSU responded with a seven-play, 90-yard drive and took a 17–14 lead when Jarvis Landry caught a 14-yard touchdown pass from Zach Mettenberger {{early in the fourth}} quarter. The next four possessions included a pair of three-and-outs for Alabama and LSU drives that stalled on a failed fourth-down conversion and a missed 45-yard Alleman field goal, before the Tide went on their game-winning drive. With only 1:34 left in the game, Alabama took possession at their own 28-yard line. McCarron then completed three consecutive passes to Kevin Norwood and moved the ball to the LSU 28-yard line. After an <b>incompletion</b> to Norwood, the game-winning touchdown was scored when McCarron threw a short screen pass to Yeldon that he took 28 yards to score and create a 21–17 lead. After a pair of short passes, the game ended when Mettenberger was sacked by Damion Square as time expired.|$|E
5|$|Both teams' {{defenses}} {{controlled the}} third quarter, allowing no points to be scored. Navy's McKee completed three more pass plays before his first <b>incompletion,</b> which came on his fourteenth attempt. Washington's offense had little {{success in the}} third quarter, being held to {{only a few yards}} gained and turning the ball over once. In the fourth quarter, after several unsuccessful drives by each team, Navy made a major error. After being stopped on their own 26-yard line, Navy improperly lined up in a punt formation, and the center snapped the ball over the punter's head. The ball was recovered by Washington on the Navy ten-yard line. Washington lost two yards in three plays, and faced a fourth down from the Navy 12-yard line. Washington stacked their offensive line, allowing their left guard, James Bryan, to become an eligible receiver. Fred Abel passed the ball to Bryan, who caught it just short of the goal line and walked into the end zone for the touchdown. Washington's kicker then converted the extra point, tying the game at 14.|$|E
50|$|After a {{scoreless}} third quarter, the Rams {{sealed the}} win with Wilkins kicking a 35-yard field goal. The Niners tried {{to mount a}} comeback as Nedney nailed a 38-yard and a 46-yard field goal. However, on four-straight plays deep in St. Louis territory, four shots to the endzone resulted in 3 <b>incompletions</b> and an interception.|$|R
50|$|LeRon McClain {{returned}} Suishams squib kick 12 {{yards to}} the Steelers 48-yard line, giving Baltimore a chance to drive for the tying touchdown. But their offense was unable to move the ball. After two <b>incompletions</b> and an 8-yard sack by Ziggy Hood, receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh dropped a potential first down catch, ending any chance of a comeback.|$|R
50|$|Brady then {{completed}} a 13-yard pass to David Patten to the Raiders' 29. After two pass <b>incompletions</b> and a Brady scramble, Vinatieri came on {{to hit a}} game-tying 45-yard field goal through the snow with just 27 seconds left. After the ensuing kickoff, the Raiders decided not to attempt to advance the ball and let the game go to overtime.|$|R
5|$|Following the Nebraska kickoff, Tech {{tried to}} answer the Cornhusker score with one of its own. The Hokies started at their 20-yard line after a touchback. Parker caught an eight-yard pass from Druckenmiller, then ran for three yards and a first down. With a first down at the Tech 31-yard line, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass. This {{was followed by a}} four-yard run by Oxendine and a ten-yard completion by Druckenmiller for another first down, this time to the Tech 45-yard line. Oxendine picked up three yards on two short runs, then Druckenmiller advanced the Hokies into the Nebraska side of the field with a 19-yard pass to Jennings. Oxendine was stopped for no gain and Druckenmiller threw an <b>incompletion,</b> but on third down, Druckenmiller connected with White for a 33-yard gain and Tech's first touchdown of the second half. The extra point was good, and the Hokies again trimmed Nebraska's lead to three points: 2421. Tech's drive covered 80 yards in 12 plays and 4:56 of game time.|$|E
5|$|The kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 27-yard line, and the Hokies began the final drive of the second quarter. Antonio Freeman caught a six-yard pass from DeShazo, then DeShazo completed a five-yard pass to Shawn Scales. DeShazo completed a four-yard pass, then Ken Oxendine had a seven-yard catch from DeShazo at the Tech 49-yard line. On the next play, Oxendine caught a short pass that pushed the Hokies to the Tennessee 45-yard line, then DeShazo threw his first incomplete pass of the drive. The <b>incompletion</b> stopped the clock with 37 seconds remaining, allowing time for DeShazo to complete a 26-yard pass to Bryan Still on the next play. Now inside the Tennessee red zone, the Hokies continued to move the ball via short passes. Tech gained a first down at the Tennessee six-yard line, and used a timeout to stop the clock {{in order to have}} a chance to earn a touchdown before halftime. On a subsequent play, however, Tech committed a five-yard penalty, and Tech head coach Frank Beamer ordered kicker Ryan Williams into the game. Williams' 27-yard field goal attempt was good, and Tech cut Tennessee's lead to 3510 at the end of the first half.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, the Rams drove to New England's 34-yard line, but Warner threw an <b>incompletion</b> on third down, and Wilkins' {{subsequent}} 52-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left.|$|E
50|$|Georgia's punt {{rolled into}} the end zone for a touchback, and with 1:28 {{remaining}} in the game, Virginia Tech began the final drive on its own 20-yard line. Any tension was soon defused by the Georgia defense, which forced three <b>incompletions</b> and a sack. Glennon's attempt at a Hail Mary pass fell short, giving Georgia the win with a final score of 31-24.|$|R
25|$|The Bills then {{responded with}} a 7-play, 43-yard scoring drive. Quarterback Jim Kelly's 24-yard pass to running back Thurman Thomas {{advanced}} the ball across the Dallas 40-yard line. After a 3-yard run by running back Kenneth Davis, however, Kelly threw two straight <b>incompletions.</b> The Bills then tied the game, 3–3, with Steve Christie's 54-yard field goal, the longest field goal in Super Bowl history.|$|R
50|$|Florida {{moved the}} ball with some success on their next possession, but were held {{for the first time}} all night by the Ohio State defense, forcing a Florida punt. Troy Smith and the Buckeyes marched back on the field, hoping to tie the game. However, Florida's {{stifling}} defensive line continued to put heavy pressure on Smith, forcing bad throws and <b>incompletions,</b> ultimately leading to a three and out.|$|R
25|$|New England {{began its}} final {{possession}} {{on its own}} 26 with 29 seconds remaining and three timeouts, but the Giants' defense didn't allow a single yard, forcing an <b>incompletion</b> on first down, a 10-yard sack by rookie lineman Jay Alford on second down, and then two deep incomplete attempts to Moss, the first that was broken up by Webster, and the second of which, on 4th-and-20, was broken up by Giants' safety Gibril Wilson and caused a turnover on downs with two seconds remaining. After the <b>incompletion,</b> {{it appeared that the}} officials would run out the clock, as it briefly read zero, before one second was re-added. Coaches, players, reporters, and fans crowded the field as if the game had ended. Belichick hugged Giants' head coach Tom Coughlin at midfield, then left for the locker room. This early departure was later criticized by some sportswriters. The entire delay lasted 2 minutes 27 seconds until Eli Manning kneeled out the final second.|$|E
25|$|On the Giants' {{following}} drive, New York {{moved the}} ball to the New England 25, but linebacker Adalius Thomas sacked Manning and forced a fumble. Smith recovered the ball, however Bradshaw was penalized for illegally batting the ball forward before the recovery. The penalty pushed the Giants out of field goal range, and following an <b>incompletion,</b> they were forced to punt.|$|E
25|$|Tampa Bay {{took the}} second half kickoff, but was forced to punt. Josh Bidwell pinned the Broncos at their own 4-yard line. On the first play of the drive, however, Cutler {{connected}} with Tony Scheffler for 33 yards, and dug themselves out of the hole. The resulting good field possession allowed Denver to punt, and pin Tampa Bay at their own 11. Brian Griese threw an <b>incompletion,</b> and suffered an injured shoulder on the play. Jeff Garcia took over at quarterback.|$|E
50|$|Dallas {{then reached}} their own 40-yard line on their next drive, but an illegal {{formation}} penalty nullified running back Emmitt Smith's 12-yard run. Troy Aikman then threw two consecutive <b>incompletions,</b> and the Cowboys {{were forced to}} punt again. The Bills subsequently advanced to midfield {{with the aid of}} a 15-yard roughing the passer penalty on Cowboys defensive lineman Leon Lett and a 21-yard reception by wide receiver Andre Reed.|$|R
25|$|Two plays after {{forcing a}} punt from Chicago {{on the opening}} drive of the second half, running back Reggie Bush caught a pass from Brees and took it 88 yards for a {{touchdown}} to cut the deficit to two points. Then after forcing another punt, New Orleans drove to the Bears' 29-yard line. But this time, they failed to score, as Brees threw three <b>incompletions</b> and Billy Cundiff missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.|$|R
50|$|However, the Vikings {{also could}} not take {{advantage}} of the turnover. Quarterback Joe Kapp's two <b>incompletions</b> and a delay of game penalty forced Minnesota to punt from their own 5-yard line. The Chiefs then took over at the Viking 44-yard line after punter Bob Lee's kick only went 39 yards. A 19-yard run by Pitts on a reverse play then set up another field goal by Stenerud to increase the Chiefs' lead to 9-0.|$|R
25|$|New England {{began its}} next {{possession}} {{on its own}} 26 with 29seconds remaining and three timeouts, but the Giants' defense didn't allow a single yard—forcing an <b>incompletion</b> on first down, a 10-yard sack by rookie lineman Jay Alford on second down, and then two deep incomplete attempts to Moss, the first that was broken up by Webster, and the second of which, on 4th-and-20, was broken up by Giants' safety Gibril Wilson and caused a turnover on downs with one second remaining. After the <b>incompletion,</b> the game clock briefly read zero (one second was re-added), and coaches, players, reporters, and fans crowded the field as if the game had ended. Belichick hugged Giants' Coach Tom Coughlin at midfield, then an official explained to both coaches that the final second had to be run. The Patriots' defense took the field, and Belichick left for the locker room, not staying for the final play. This early departure was later criticized by some sportswriters who felt Belichick was being a sore loser, while others noted that he had properly congratulated Coughlin (they also noted Coughlin {{was one of the}} few opposing coaches he didn't loathe) and that the game was over once the Patriots failed to convert on 4th down.|$|E
25|$|Arkansas got off on {{the wrong}} foot as punter Richie Butler's punt was blocked, setting up a one-yard {{touchdown}} run for Georgia running back Musa Smith. Another run by Smith pushed the Bulldog advantage to 14–0. Three Georgia field goals added to the score to make it 23–0. Arkansas had only one scoring drive, but even that was on life support, kept alive by two personal fouls, one after an <b>incompletion</b> on 3rd and 23. Georgia added a touchdown, won the game 30–3, and with the victory won the Southeastern Conference.|$|E
25|$|Summerall {{told the}} rest of CBS crew {{to get ready for}} a {{roll-out}} pass, because without any timeouts remaining a failed run play would end the game. Landry would say he expected a rollout pass attempt because an <b>incompletion</b> would stop the clock and allow the Packers one more play on fourth down, either for a touchdown (to win) or a field goal attempt (to tie and send the game into overtime). But Green Bay's pass protection on the slick field had been seriously tested during the game; the Cowboys had sacked Starr eight times.|$|E
50|$|The Titans posted their sixth win of {{the season}} as Marcus Mariota faced off against Matt Barkley, in his first NFL action since 2014; he opened scoring {{late in the first}} quarter on a seven-yard toss. Mariota {{answered}} with three straight touchdown drives, but Barkley answered a Titans lead of 27-7 with two straight touchdown drives and whipped to the Titans red zone in the final minute, but two <b>incompletions</b> ended the game.|$|R
50|$|West {{returned}} the ensuing kickoff 27 {{yards to the}} 32-yard line. Then on the first play of the drive, Kapp completed a 27-yard pass to Henderson to advance {{the ball to the}} Kansas City 41-yard line. However, on the next 3 plays, Kapp threw 2 <b>incompletions</b> and was sacked by defensive tackle Buck Buchanan for an 8-yard loss. Then on fourth down, kicker Fred Cox's 56-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts.|$|R
50|$|Two plays after {{forcing a}} punt from Chicago {{on the opening}} drive of the second half, running back Reggie Bush caught a pass from Brees and took it 88 yards for a {{touchdown}} to cut the deficit to two points. Then after forcing another punt, New Orleans drove to the Bears 29-yard line. But this time, they failed to score, as Brees threw three <b>incompletions</b> and Billy Cundiff missed a 47-yard field goal attempt.|$|R
