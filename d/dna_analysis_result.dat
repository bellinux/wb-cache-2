Methods We studied 134 subjects with varicocele admitted consecutively to the outpatients Department of Infertility at the University of Rome La Sapienza. We investigated in these subjects the effect of a strong apoptosis inducer, the p 53 codon 72 *Arg/*Arg genotype, on spermatic parameters. The p 53 codon 72 genotype was determined by <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Results</b> The proportion of spermatozoa with abnormal (curvilinear) motility is higher in men with the *Arg/*Arg genotype than in men carrying the *Pro allele (p = 0. 003).

Bacterial community fingerprints were obtained both from DNA and RNA analyses, indicating differences between the microorganisms present and metabolically active in these white colonizations. Metabolically active microorganisms represented {{only a fraction of the}} total bacterial community present in the colonizations. 16 S rRNA gene libraries were used to identify the major representative members of the studied communities.

40|$|Background Junctional epidermolysis bullosa, type Herlitz (JEB-H) is a rare, {{autosomal}} recessive disease caused by {{absence of the}} epidermal basement membrane adhesion protein laminin- 332. It is characterized by extensive and devastating blistering of the skin and mucous membranes, leading to death in early childhood. Objectives To present {{the results of the}} long-term follow-up of a cohort of patients with JEB-H, and to provide guidelines for prognosis, treatment and care. Methods All patients with JEB-H included in the Dutch Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) Registry between 1988 and 2011 were followed longitudinally by our EB team. Diagnosis was established using immunofluorescence antigen mapping, electron microscopy and <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Results</b> In total, we included 22 patients with JEB-H over a 23 -year period. Their average age at death was 5. 8 months (range 0. 5 - 32. 6 months). The causes of death were, in order of frequency: failure to thrive, respiratory failure, pneumonia, dehydration, anaemia, sepsis and euthanasia. The pattern of initial weight gain was a predictor of lifespan in these patients. Invasive treatments to extend life did not promote survival in our patients. Conclusions It is important to diagnose JEB-H as soon as possible after birth so that the management can be shifted from life-saving to comfort care. The palliative end-of-life care can take place in hospital, but is also safe in the home setting. Suffering in patients with JEB-H can become so unbearable that in some patients who do not respond to adequate analgesic and sedative treatment, newborn euthanasia, performed according to the Groningen protocol, is legally permitted in the Netherlands...|$|R
40|$|DNA is {{nowadays}} swabbed routinely {{to investigate}} serious and volume crimes, but research remains scarce {{when it comes}} to determining the criteria that may impact the success rate of DNA swabs taken on different surfaces and situations. To investigate these criteria in fully operational conditions, <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> of 4772 swabs taken by the forensic unit of a police department in Western Switzerland over a 2. 5 -year period (2012 - 2014) in volume crime cases were considered. A representative and random sample of 1236 swab analyses was extensively examined and codified, describing several criteria such as whether the swabbing was performed at the scene or in the lab, the zone of the scene where it was performed, the kind of object or surface that was swabbed, whether the target specimen was a touch surface or a biological fluid, and whether the swab targeted a single surface or combined different surfaces. The impact of each criterion and of their combination was assessed in regard to the success rate of <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis,</b> measured through the quality of the resulting profile, and whether the profile resulted in a hit in the national database or not. Results show that some situations - such as swabs taken on door and window handles for instance - have a higher success rate than average swabs. Conversely, other situations lead to a marked decrease in the success rate, which should discourage further analyses of such swabs. Results also confirm that targeting a DNA swab on a single surface is preferable to swabbing different surfaces with the intent to aggregate cells deposited by the offender. Such results assist in predicting the chance that the analysis of a swab taken in a given situation will lead to a positive result. The study could therefore inform an evidence-based approach to decision-making at the crime scene (what to swab or not) and at the triage step (what to analyse or not), contributing thus to save resource and increase the efficiency of forensic science efforts...|$|R

This technique {{makes it possible to}} screen {{for a wide range of}} previously unscreened inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) using a single test. This 3 -year pilot study investigated the screening, diagnosis, treatment and outcomes of IEM in symptomatic infants and children. Methods All children encountered in the Newborn Screening Center of Zhejiang Province during a 3 -year period with symptoms suspicious for IEM were screened for metabolic diseases. Dried blood spots were collected and analyzed by tandem {{mass spectrometry}}. The diagnoses were further confirmed by clinical symptoms and biochemical analysis. Neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency, ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency and primary carnitine deficiency were confirmed by <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Results</b> A total of 11, 060 symptomatic patients (6, 720 boys, 4, 340 girls) with a median age of 28. 8 months (range: 0. 04 - 168. 2 months) were screened. Among these, 62 were diagnosed with IEM, with a detection rate of 0. 56 %. Thirty-five were males and 27 females and the median age was 3. 55 months (range 0. 07 - 143. 9 months). Of the 62 patients, 27 (43. 5 %) had aminoacidemias, 26 (41. 9 %) had organic acidemias and nine (14. 5 %) had fatty acid oxidation disorders. Conclusions Because most symptomatic patients are diagnosed at an older age, mental retardation and motor delay are difficult to reverse. Additionally, poor medication compliance reduces the efficacy of treatment. More extensive newborn screening is thus imperative for ensuring early diagnosis and enhancing the treatment efficacy of IEM. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Culicoides imicola Kieffer, 1913 is {{the main}} vector of {{bluetongue}} virus (BTV) and African horse sickness virus (AHSV) in Sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding the population genetic structure of this midge {{and the nature of}} barriers to gene flow will lead to a deeper understanding of bluetongue epidemiology and more effective vector control in this region. Methods: A panel of 12 DNA microsatellite markers isolated de novo and mitochondrial DNA were utilized in a study of C. imicola populations from Africa and an outlier population from the Balearic Islands. The DNA microsatellite markers and mitochondrial DNA were also used to examine a population of closely related C. bolitinos Meiswinkel midges. Results: The microsatellite data suggest gene flow between Kenya and south-west Indian Ocean Islands exist while a restricted gene flow between Kenya and South Africa C. imicola populations occurs. Genetic distance correlated with geographic distance by Mantel test. The mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> imply that the C. imicola populations from Kenya and south-west Indian Ocean Islands (Madagascar and Mauritius) shared haplotypes while C. imicola population from South Africa possessed private haplotypes and the highest nucleotide diversity among the African populations. The Bayesian skyline plot suggested a population growth. Conclusions: The gene flow demonstrated by this study indicates a potential risk of introduction of new BTV serotypes by wind-borne infected Culicoides into the Islands. Genetic similarity between Mauritius and South Africa may be due to translocation as a result of human-induced activities; this could impact negatively on the livestock industry.

The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{incidence}} of myocardial involvement and the relation of cardiac disease to the molecular defect at the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or protein level in Becker muscular dystrophy. Background. Dystrophin gene mutations produce clinical manifestations of disease in the heart and skeletal muscle of patients with Becker muscular dystrophy. Methods. Thirty-one patients underwent electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination and 24 -h Holter monitoring. The diagnosis was established by neurologic examination, dystrophin immunohistochemical assays or Western blot on muscle biopsy, or both, and <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Results.</b> Electrocardiographic and echocardiographic findings were abnormal in 68 % and 62 % of the patients, respectively. Right ventricular involvement was detected in 52 %. Left ventricular impairment was observed either as an isolated phenomenon (10 %) or in association with right ventricular dysfunction (29 %). Right ventricular disease was manifested in the teenagers, and an impairment of the left ventricle was observed in older patients. Right ventricular end-diastolic volumes were significantly increased compared with those in a control group. The left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly lower in older patients than in control subjects or younger patients. Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias were detected in four patients. No correlations were found between skeletal muscle disease, cardiac involvement and dystrophin abnormalities. In our patients, exon 49 deletion was invariably associated with cardiac involvement. Exon 48 deletion was associated with cardiac disease in all but two patients. Conclusions. The cardiac manifestation of Becker muscular dystrophy is characterized by early right ventricular involvement associated or not with left ventricular impairment.

Participants were 471 pairs of same-sex twins (345 monozygotic, 126 dizygotic) with a mean age of 14. 56 years (SD = 2. 62). A second sample was recruited for cross-validation, including 382 pairs of same-sex twins (261 monozygotic, 121 dizygotic) with a mean age of 12. 53 years (SD = 2. 22). The questionnaire consisted of 12 questions dealing with co-twin similarity or frequency of confusion. Two means were put forward to improve the predictive accuracy of the questionnaire adding parent-reports to the analysis, and using a 2 -point rather than 3 -point response format. DNA genotyping was performed on nine short tandem repeat loci, with an estimated zygosity classification accuracy very close to 100 %. The validity of all questionnaires was assessed by being compared to the <b>results</b> of <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Results</b> of stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that the predictive accuracy of the 3 -point self-reported questionnaire is 83. 8 %. Using parent-reports and 2 -point scale led to 3. 9 % and 4. 6 % increase in predictive accuracy, respectively. When using the parent-reports and children's self-reports jointly, the predictive accuracy was enhanced to 90. 6 %. For the cross-validation, the equations and cut-offs derived from the first sample led to an acceptable accuracy (91. 3 %) in the second sample. In conclusion, the method we developed can be used in future studies among Chinese adolescent twins.

40|$|Abstract Background Cadmium {{is one of}} the inflammation-related {{xenobiotics}} and {{has been}} regarded as a potent carcinogen. The relationship between inflammation and cell proliferation due to chronic infection has been studied, but the mechanism is not fully clear. Though the mode of cadmium toxicity is well characterized in animal cells, still it requires some further investigations. Previously we reported that cadmium induces immune cell death in Swiss albino mice. In the present study we showed that instead of inducing cell death mechanism, cadmium in low concentration triggers proliferation in mice lung cell and our results reveals that prior to the induction of proliferation it causes severe inflammation. Methods Swiss albino mice were treated with different concentrations of cadmium to determine the LD 50. Mice were subdivided (5 mice each) according to the exposure period (15, 30, 45, 60 days) and were given sub lethal dose (5 mg/Kg body weight) of cadmium chloride and ibuprofen (50 mg/Kg body weight, recommended dose) once in a week. SEM and histology were performed as evidence of changes in cellular morphology. Inflammation was measured by the expression of Cox- 2 and MMPs. Expression of proinflammatory cytokines (Cox- 2, IL- 6), signaling and cell cycle regulatory molecules (STAT 3, Akt, CyclinD 1) were measured by western blot, ELISA and immunoprecipitation. Mutagenecity was evidenced by comet assay. Cell proliferation was determined by cell count, cell cycle and <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> <b>Results</b> Prolonged exposure of low concentration of cadmium resulted in up regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and cell cycle regulatory molecules. Though NSAIDs like Ibuprofen reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, but it did not show any inhibitory effect on cadmium adopted lung cell proliferation.

We have also previously identified two germline {{mutations in}} the MRE 11 gene among breast cancer patients whose tumors showed decreased expression of the MRN complex proteins MRE 11, RAD 50, and NBS 1 that {{play an important role in}} the DNA damage response (Bartkova et al. 2008). The breast tumors were studied by immunohistochemical staining of MRE 11, RAD 50, and NBS 1, and patients whose tumors had reduced expression of all three proteins were selected for further germline <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> These <b>results</b> indicate that loss or reduction of protein expression in the tumor may be a sign of underlying inactivating germline mutations.|$|R

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Katherine A Roberts, Donald J Johnson, Joseph L PetersonAmplification, Criminalistics, Forensic science, Identifiler Plus, ValidationThe AmpFlSTR?? Identifiler Plus PCR Amplification Kit {{represents}} the next-generation PCR amplification technology by providing short tandem repeat data at 15 loci and the amelogenin marker with increased sensitivity, efficiency, and performance on mixture samples. The validation {{study reported here}} was conducted to assess {{the performance of the}} new kit with respect to analytical threshold, sensitivity, peak height ratio, stutter, precision, reproducibility, stochastic thresholds, mixtures, injection time, and contamination and on samples that represent the range of those commonly analyzed in forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>analysis.</b> 	The <b>results</b> of this validation study demonstrate that the Identifiler Plus amplification kit offers a number of improvements when compared with the Identifiler kit currently in use. The new kit displayed increased sensitivity and cleaner background noise in addition to robust peak heights and peak height ratios. Finally, the modified cycling protocol has a shorter amplification time resulting in an overall decrease in analysis time...|$|R
