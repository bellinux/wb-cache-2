Possibly because of this, the boiler lagging was continued over the smokebox, which was not common; most North American locomotives had bare smokeboxes which were <b>graphited,</b> rather than painted.

40|$|This study {{introduces}} <b>graphited</b> nanodiamond (G-ND) as {{an environmentally}} friendly, easy-to-regenerate, and cost-effective alternative catalyst to activate persulfate (i. e., peroxymonosulfate (PMS) and peroxydisulfate (PDS)) and oxidize organic compounds in water. The G-ND {{was found to}} be superior for persulfate activation to other benchmark carbon materials such as graphite, graphene, fullerene, and carbon nanotubes. The G-ND/persulfate showed selective reactivity toward phenolic compounds and some pharmaceuticals, and the degradation kinetics were not inhibited by the presence of oxidant scavengers and natural organic matter. These results indicate that radical intermediates such as sulfate radical anion and hydroxyl radical are not majorly responsible for this persulfate-driven oxidation of organic compounds. The findings from linear sweep voltammetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses suggest that the both persulfate and phenol effectively bind to G-ND surface and are likely to form charge transfer complex, in which G-ND plays a critical role in mediating facile electron transfer from phenol to persulfate. © 2016 American Chemical Societyclos...|$|R
40|$|A new {{application}} of the electrical-analog method is introduced {{for the evaluation of}} the {Mathematical expression} strain, normal to the surface of a thin sheet loaded under conditions of plane stress in plasticity. The analogy relating the two physical phenomena of {Mathematical expression} distribution in a plane-stress plastic field and the potential φ of a plane electrostatic field {{is based on the assumption}} that the Cartesian components of strain parallel to the surface of the body vary along the thickness of the strip. They are expressed as a sum of a term independent of z and a second term, which is a second degree function of the z-coordinate normal to the surface of the body. The boundary conditions of the {Mathematical expression} distribution may be easily determined by a photoelastic method using birefringent coatings cemented on the surface of the metallic specimens. Then, the electrical analogy can be applied for the evaluation of the {Mathematical expression} distribution all over the field. The <b>graphited</b> paper was used as conducting surface in the {{application of the}} analogy. The values of {Mathematical expression}, together with data obtained by the birefringent coating and concerning the two other Cartesian components of strain, yield an explicit analytic solution of the elastic-plastic plane-stress problem. The method is applied to a plane-stress restricted plasticity problem of a thin slab, with two semicircular grooves in pure tension. The results were compared with those obtained by a photoelastic pointwise solution using normal and oblique incidence. The agreement between these results shows the accuracy of the method. © 1963 Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc...|$|R
50|$|In {{graph theory}} and {{combinatorial}} optimization, a closure of a directed graph {{is a set}} of vertices with no outgoing edges.That is, the graph should have no edges that start within the closure and end outside the closure.The closure problem is the task of finding the maximum-weight or minimum-weight closure in a vertex-weighted directed <b>graph.It</b> may be solved in polynomial time using a reduction to the maximum flow problem. It may be used to model various application problems of choosing an optimal subset of tasks to perform, with dependencies between pairs of tasks, one example being in open pit mining.|$|E
50|$|A common {{interior}} {{point of}} two edges, {{at which the}} first edge passes {{from one side of}} the second edge to the other, is called a crossing. Two edges of a topological graph cross each other if they determine a crossing. For any integer k > 1, a topological or geometric graph is called k-quasi-planar if it has no k pairwise crossing edges.Using this terminology, if a topological graph is 2-quasi-planar, then it is a planar <b>graph.It</b> follows from Euler's polyhedral formula that every planar graph with n > 2 vertices has at most 3n &minus; 6 edges. Therefore, every 2-quasi-planar graph with n > 2 vertices has at most 3n &minus; 6 edges.|$|E

40|$|Polymeric {{membrane}} {{materials were}} {{recognized as a}} promising tool for gas separation. However, these polymer membranes are deficient {{to meet the requirements}} of membrane technology, especially operation at high temperature and harsh environment. In the recent decades, membrane materials based on carbon material have served as an alternative candidate for various types of gas separations. Carbon membrane is an inorganic membrane, which can be fabricated by using thermosetting polymer. The concept of carbon membrane or film for gas separation {{can be traced back to}} the early 1970 s. These membranes were prepared by compressed nonporous <b>graphited</b> carbon into a plug (hence the name ‘carbon membrane’) [1]. Carbon membranes have excellent thermal and chemical stability, compared to polymeric membranes commercially available in the industry. Besides, they can also attain high selectivity without losing the productivity and thus surpass the upper bound limit of polymeric membranes [2 – 5]. At present, carbon membrane materials have become more important in the new era of membrane technology for gas separation and liquid–liquid phase separation due to their higher selectivity and permeability, stability and hightemperature operations, and well-defined stable pore structure. In addition, unlike polymeric membranes, carbon membranes are usually durable and capable of withstanding adverse and rigorous environment because of their high thermal and chemical resistance. Carbon membranes demonstrate attractive characteristics among molecular sieving materials such as excellent shape selectivity for planar molecule and high hydrophobicity. It is, however, more feasible to form carbon molecular sieve membranes (CMSMs) [6 – 8]. These characteristics have stimulated interest among researchers in the early 1980 s to further investigate the separation characteristics of these membranes. Recently, carbon membranes have also been found to be very useful materials in the preparation of nanofiltration [9], pervaporation [10], and microfiltration membrane [11]. This chapter addresses the important aspects of carbon membrane fabrication in view of preparing a good-quality carbon membrane for gas separation processes...|$|R
