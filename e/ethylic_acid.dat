Extraction {{processes such as}} emulsion extraction, a process derived from the industrial liquid-liquid extraction, {{can be used to}} remove molecules. This chapter presents preview studies dealing with these two processes for bio-{{products and}} notably for organic acids from biomass: different parameters were described. Then, a study on eco-conception of these processes for gallic acid with bio-diluents (one hydrogenated terpene and three <b>ethylic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> esters) was presented and compared with results using dodecane, a current petrochemical diluent. A pre-study about eco-conception of liquid-liquid extraction for gallic acid was performed. An extractant as tributyl phosphate (TBP) was necessary, and extraction yield was higher with TBP diluted in <b>ethylic</b> fatty <b>acid</b> esters than in dodecane. So it is possible with esters to reduce the TBP concentration. In extraction by emulsion with the esters as diluents, there was no need of an extractant, gallic acid being slightly soluble in these esters. However, emulsion containing these bio-diluents swelled, which do not exist with dodecane...|$|R

Despite their importance for the production of <b>ethylic</b> biodiesel, fatty <b>acid</b> ethyl ester+ethanol+glycerol systems have been, up to now, object of less attention than the corresponding systems formed during biodiesel production using methanol. In this work, new experimental measurements were performed for the liquid–liquid equilibria of the systems ethyl linoleate/ethyl oleate/ethyl palmitate/ethyl laurate+ethanol+glycerol at 323. 15 and 333. 15 K. It is shown that the Cubic-Plus-Association Equation of State (CPA EoS) can successfully predict the new experimental data with global average deviations inferior to 6 %...|$|R

Acetic acid is soluble in alcohol, miscible with water, glycerol, ether, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, and practically insoluble in carbon disulfide. PRODUCTION AND USES Commercial production of acetic acid is often accomplished by a chemical reaction of methanol and carbon monoxide (with catalyst). Other production methods include liquid- and vapor-phase oxidation of petroleum gases (with catalyst), oxidation of acetaldehyde, and fermentative oxidation of ethanol. Acetic acid is the 33 rd highest-volume chemical produced in the United States. Acetic acid is used in the manufacture of acetic anhydride, cellulose acetate, vinyl acetate monomer, acetic esters, chloracetic acid, plastics, dyes, insecticides, photographic chemicals, and rubber. Other commercial uses include the manufacture of vitamins, antibiotics, hormones, and organic chemicals, and as a food additive (acidulant). It is also used in various textile printing processes. Vinegar and “dilute acetic acid” are about 4 % to 6 % acetic acid. Essence of vinegar is 14 % acetic acid. NATURAL SOURCE...|$|E
