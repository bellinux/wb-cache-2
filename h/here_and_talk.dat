500|$|In 2002, Carey {{signed a}} new record deal with Island Records and in 2005 she {{released}} her tenth studio album, The Emancipation of Mimi. It became the best-selling album of 2005 the United States, and the second best-seller around the world, with over 12 million units sold. It earned a myriad of music industry awards, and brought Carey {{back to the top}} of pop music following her commercial decline in 2001. After completing The Adventures of Mimi Tour, she began working on material for her eleventh studio effort, the yet untitled E=MC². E=MC² was hailed {{as one of the most}} anticipated albums of 2008, with many critics weighing their opinions on whether Carey would be able to deliver significant success, following her achievements with The Emancipation of Mimi. Carey began writing and producing the music she saw fit, and not anything to please record executives. Throughout 2007, Carey recorded the album in a studio built into her private villa in Anguilla, in the Caribbean. She describe E=MC² as one of her most expressive albums, and one that she felt free on, and able to express herself through her music. In an interview with The Bryan Times, Carey spoke of her sentiments on the album [...] "It's hard for me to sit <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about it without sounding like if I'm bragging if I'm in love with it, but I am I love with this album. I think that having the success with the last record allowed me to have more [...] freedom...and just make records that I like. Its kind of a really fun record.|$|E
2500|$|She {{started to}} see people that weren't there. She thought I could see them too, but, of course, I couldn't. I would make fun of her like, [...] "I'm {{going to go in}} the other room and you stay <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to your friends." ...|$|E
2500|$|A herald brings {{news of the}} {{approach}} of ambassadors from Venice. Iago explains to Otello that he will lure Cassio <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> with him while Otello watches, hidden. He leaves to go get Cassio. (Iago: Qui trarrò Cassio / [...] "Here I will bring Cassio".) ...|$|E
6000|$|Hetty made {{a little}} sign of impatience. [...] "Yes, there are--lots of them. Of course, you think all women are silly--you're only a man. Besides, Tom pinched me. But why are you {{stopping}} <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking?</b> Go <b>and</b> bring him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must go to}} Tretton first," [...] said he. [...] "And now, my dear, you {{are doing}} no good by sitting up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> to me." [...] Then, with a smile, Dolly took herself off to her own chamber.|$|R
6000|$|... "Has Selena been pasted up at {{that window}} ever {{since the last time}} we stood <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked,</b> Mattie?" [...] asked Jed, half resentfully, half amusedly. It was {{characteristic}} of Mattie to laugh first at the question, and then blush over the memory it revived.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Barker as {{she turned}} away, [...] "he {{might just as well}} lunch <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> about HER--and see her, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{going to}} camp right <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> this thing out," [...] he said, and {{taking off his}} net shoe began to scrape up the snow.|$|E
6000|$|... "Damn you, Julian!" [...] he exclaimed. [...] "If I {{could stand}} on two legs, I'd break your head. How dare you come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> such rubbish." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{your home}} with that uncle of yours?" [...] She had {{heard so much}} of his family; but he had as yet spoken to her no word about Caroline. [...] "I wonder what he would say if he could see you now leaning <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I won't hear {{even that}} patiently. You {{know nothing about}} her, except {{that she is a}} second-class passenger,--in which matter she is exactly my equal. If you come to that, don't you think that you are {{degrading}} yourself in coming <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> to me? I am not your equal.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Rides in howdays, does he?" [...] {{he cried}} loudly and sneeringly. [...] "Rides on {{elephants}} in howdahs and {{calls himself a}} prince! Kings--yah! Comes over <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> horse till you would {{think he was a}} president; and then goes home and rides in a private dining-room strapped onto an elephant. Well, well, well!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come to the carriage--quick!" [...] she said. [...] "I do {{not wish}} to stay <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to those policemen." [...] Hurrying out of the Gardens, she drove away.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{need not}} let {{any of them}} see it," [...] said Miss Schuyler, sharply. [...] "Sit quite still <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to me. Now, what right had those men to arrest him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do {{not want}} to go far,' she said; 'we can walk up and down <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> as well as {{anywhere}} else. Will you give me a plain answer to a question?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{the things}} you DO in the graveyard. It wouldn't matter if you just sat <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talked</b> quiet, same as we're doing now. Well, I don't {{know what is going}} to come of it all, but I DO know that Elder Warren is going to speak to your pa about it. Deacon Hazard is his cousin." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is my wife, sir, {{and that}} is ten times more. Do {{you think that you}} would do more for her than I would do,--drink more of Esill? You had better go away, Sir Marmaduke. You can do no good by coming <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> of your daughter. I would have given the world to save her;--but she would not be saved." ...|$|R
50|$|Baggott's {{work has}} {{appeared}} in AGNI, The New York Times, The Boston Globe, Glamour, Ms., Real Simple, and read on NPR's <b>Here</b> <b>and</b> Now <b>and</b> <b>Talk</b> of the Nation. Her essays, stories, and poems are highly anthologized. She also writes haiku, which is one of her many passions.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{so would}} I, Patsy Cooper. It {{seems to me}} that if we can save these poor persecuted strangers, it is our bounden duty to stand up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> for them till--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They don't like it," [...] he said. [...] "It isn't kind to {{old people}} to leave them alone--although I've no doubt it's much more amusing to sit up <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to Henry." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} down to the shore to get my hat and shoes," [...] he said, [...] "and I would like you to come along with me. I can't stand <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you, I'll begin myself. Do you remember, {{the other}} day, {{when we were}} <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> were <b>talking</b> of the {{difference}} in peoples' pride?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very disagreeable if our {{marriage}} {{is to be}} put off by it. I {{think it will be}} so much nicer making love somewhere on the Rhine than having snatches of it <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> all the time about wills and tenements and settlements." [...] As he said this, with his arm round her waist and his face quite close to hers,--shewing thereby that he was not altogether averse even to his present privileges,--she forgave him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Serious!" [...] he cried. [...] "Good Lord! is {{this street}} serious? Are these damned Chinese {{lanterns}} serious? Is the whole caboodle serious? One comes <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> {{a pack of}} bosh, and perhaps some sense as well, but I should think very little {{of a man who}} didn't keep something in the background of his life that was more serious than all this talking--something more serious, whether it was religion or only drink." ...|$|R
6000|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. No; but {{you asked}} me to come down <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to you; and you {{mentioned}} casually that if I didnt youd have nobody to talk about me to but Bentley. That was a threat, was it not? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{tell you}} what," [...] burst forth Leon; [...] "you, Madame, go into another room and talk {{it over with}} my wife; and I'll stay <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> it over with your husband. It may come to nothing, but let's try." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton laughed, and Miss Deringham found {{something}} pleasant in his naive directness. [...] "Now, that's not fair. If I had been I should have gone," [...] said he. [...] "It would please {{me to stay}} right <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to you all day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't I tell you, then, I wouldn't {{be bothered}} with your business? If you must come up <b>here</b> jawing <b>and</b> <b>talking,</b> can't you have it out with Thady there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{seems so}} horrible that nobody knew it," [...] said the young girl, shuddering; [...] "that we sat <b>here</b> {{laughing}} <b>and</b> <b>talking,</b> while perhaps he was--Good heavens! what's that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Lord Mackworth bowed with {{a mocking}} courtesy. [...] "Marry!" [...] said he. [...] "Methought {{it was one}} of mine own saucy popinjay squires that I caught sneaking <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> to those two foolish young lasses, and lo! it is a young Lord--or mayhap thou art a young Prince--and commandeth me that I shall not do this and I shall not do that. I crave your Lordship's honorable pardon, if I have said aught that may have galled you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't tell any one; {{only now}} and then we'll come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> things over, and I'll pay you for it by telling all I know about my sort of things. Will that do?" [...] and Dan held out his big, rough hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I am {{very much}} obliged {{to you for}} your advice, which I will {{certainly}} take; that is, I will not decide for a few days, and will come in <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk</b> to the miners and learn what I can about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Martineau, {{a little}} out of breath as though he had been running upstairs, with his hands in his trouser pockets, seemed intent only on disavowals. [...] "People come <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talk.</b> It does them good, and {{sometimes}} I am able to offer a suggestion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{go to the}} devil! I can't stand your coming <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talking</b> about 'little Tuppence.' Go {{and look}} after your cousin. Tuppence is my girl! I've always loved her, {{from the time we}} played {{together}} as kids. We grew up and it was just the same. I shall never forget when I was in hospital, and she came in in that ridiculous cap and apron! It was like a miracle to see the girl I loved turn up in a nurse's kit----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I {{am not a}} poacher," [...] cried Adam, in a rending {{voice that}} rang round the hollow shrines and urns like the echoes of his gun. [...] "Because the {{partridge}} lying dead over there is my partridge. Because the land you are standing on is my land. Because my own land was only taken from me by a crime, and a worse crime than poaching. This has been a single estate for {{hundreds and hundreds of}} years, and if you or any meddlesome mountebank comes <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>talks</b> of cutting it up like a cake, if I ever hear a word more of you and your leveling lies--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} {{better than you}} believe," [...] he assured her, {{slackening}} his speed a little. [...] "We have met, I suppose, a dozen times in our lives. I have danced with you <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there, <b>talked</b> nonsense once, I remember, at a musical reception--" ...|$|R
