40|$|The {{penetration}} of intermittent {{renewable energy sources}} (IRESs) into power grids has increased in the last decade. Integration of wind farms and solar systems as the major IRESs have significantly boosted the level of uncertainty in operation of power systems. This paper proposes a comprehensive computational framework for quantification and integration of uncertainties in distributed power systems (DPSs) with IRESs. Different sources of uncertainties in DPSs such as electrical load, wind and solar power <b>forecasts</b> and <b>generator</b> outages are covered by the proposed framework. Load forecast uncertainty is assumed to follow a normal distribution. Wind and solar forecast are implemented by a list of prediction intervals (PIs) ranging from 5 % to 95 %. Their uncertainties are further represented as scenarios using a scenario generation method. Generator outage uncertainty is modeled as discrete scenarios. The integrated uncertainties are further incorporated into a stochastic security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) problem and a heuristic genetic algorithm is utilized to solve this stochastic SCUC problem. To demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed method, five deterministic and four stochastic case studies are implemented. Generation costs as well as different reserve strategies are discussed from the perspectives of system economics and reliability. Comparative results indicate that the planned generation costs and reserves are different from the realized ones. The stochastic models show better robustness than deterministic ones. Power systems run a higher level of risk during peak load hours...|$|R
40|$|Engineered {{trenches}} (ETs) {{are considered}} to be a cost-effective method for disposing Low Level Waste (LLW). Based on waste <b>forecasts</b> from waste <b>generators,</b> the last engineered trench in operation (ET No. 2) is anticipated to close in FY 14, requiring development of a new ET. Solid Waste requested that SRNL develop an assessment report that reviews four disposal options for this new ET (ET No. 3) and determine which option would provide the 'best' Performance Assessment (PA) disposal limits for LLW (Appendix A). Those four options (see option footprint locations in Figure 1 - 1) are: (1) Disposal at grade on TRU Pads 7 - 13 where soil would be mounded over waste packages; (2) Excavation at a slightly modified SLIT No. 13 location - near the Used Equipment Storage Area; (3) Excavation at a modified SLIT No. 12 location - near the 643 - 26 E Naval Reactor Component Disposal Area; and (4) Excavation east of TRU Pad No. 26 that replaces northeast portions of four slit trench (ST) disposal units in the eastern set of STs. The assessment consisted of both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The quantitative analysis captured key aspects that were readily quantifiable and had predictable impacts on limits and doses. A simplified modeling strategy stemming from current Special Analysis (SA) practices was employed. Both inventory capacity for a specific nuclide (a quasi-inventory limit) and overall performance for specified inventory mixtures (doses resulting from historical inventories) were considered.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} uses {{recently developed}} empirical methodologies {{for the study}} of multi-unit auctions to test the impacts of Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) on the competitiveness of restructured electricity markets. FTRs are a special type of financial option that hedge against volatility in the cost of transporting electricity over the grid. Policy makers seek to use the prices of FTRs as market signals to incentivize efficient investment and utilization of transmission capacity. However, prices will not send the correct signals if market participants strategically use FTRs. This dissertation uses data from the Texas electricity market to test whether the prices of FTRs are efficient to achieve such goals. The auctions studied are multiunit, uniform-price, sealed-bid auctions. The first part of the dissertation studies the auctions on the spot market of the wholesale electricity industry. I derive structural empirical models to test theoretical predictions as to whether bidders fully internalize the effect of FTRs on profits into their bidding decisions. I find that bidders are learning as to how to optimally bid above marginal cost for their inframarginal capacities. The bidders also learn to bid to include FTRs into their profit maximization problem {{during the course of the}} first year. But starting from the second year, they deviated from optimal bidding that includes FTRs in the profit maximization problems. Counterfactual analysis show that the primary effect of FTRs on market outcomes is changing the level of prices rather than production efficiency. Finally, I find that in most months, the current allocations of FTRs are statistically equivalent to the optimal allocations. The second part of the dissertation studies the bidding behavior in the FTR auctions. I find that FTRs?? strategic impact on the FTR purchasing behavior is significant for large bidders ?? firms exercising market power in the FTR auctions. Second, trader forecasts future FTR credit very accurately while large <b>generators??</b> <b>forecasts</b> of future FTR credit tends to be biased upward.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of diverging trends in Renewable Energy Sources (RES) application {{in the various}} Member States, and identification of the driving forces behind the different trends is an important mission of the Renewable Energy Unit (REU). This can reveal which policy approaches perform better in the various socio-economic environment and by their comparison and dissemination it can foster {{the selection of the}} most appropriate policy tool for decision makers. Renewable energy use and the projected shares of the renewable energy sources (RES) in the final energy mix show positive tendencies all over Europe. Beyond the positive impression one can draw from the increase, there are signs that there are some diverging tendencies among different groups of countries. In this context the roundtable had a twofold objective. First it aimed at classifying and ranking the most important factors in CEE countries impeding a more rapid deployment of renewable energy sources for electricity production (RES-E). We used the following problem classification: ¿	Financial o	Regulative ¿ support measures ¿	Institutional o	Network management -infrastructure ¿	Trans-Boundary Power Exchange (Cross-Border Issues) ¿	Power Systems Interconnection / Fair third party access rules o	Market structure/concentration The second objective was to identify efficient ways to overcome these barriers from demonstrations of successful examples from Member States with longer RES-E integration experience. Some of the best available techniques and country experience with the different policies were presented at the roundtable. The invited experts shared their experiences gained at various institutions: energy regulation offices, grid operating entities, energy production units and quite a few in energy related research organisations. Beside the positive examples, the barriers that exist in the various member states were also discussed. The roundtable proceeding may help the stakeholders in the identification of their strategic benefits from RES integration. The more rapid development of RES can offer advantages for all stakeholder groups: this win-win situation can be realised if all stakeholders of the market and regulation would be informed better how to benefit from the increased diversification offered by RES. The major benefits can be identified as the following for the stakeholders. ¿	Regulators can get a better understanding how the problems of larger scale integration the RES sources were overcome in different countries. More sophisticated regulatory mechanisms and better information systems can strengthen the position of regulatory bodies. Improving market conditions, bidding procedures, (ie. day and hour ahead market instead of the monthly schedule), embedding forecasting systems will lead to enhanced regulatory regimes. ¿	Grid operators are interested in the DER integration challenges, system loss reduction, access conditions, integrating output <b>forecast</b> from intermittent <b>generators</b> that can contribute to improved grid operation methods. ¿	Power production investors seek low volatility, secure cash flow (feed in tariff), diversification, immunity from oil price changes and carbon prices. ¿	Researchers quest for innovation and cost reduction by technological learning.

40|$|The Royal Netherlands {{air force}} (RNLAF) has been {{coping with a}} low {{availability}} of F- 16 aircraft. It has been acknowledged that increasing the availability of avionics components is most beneficial to increasing fleet availability. Especially for F- 16, rich database information is available including past operations and maintenance dating back to 1996. Improving the methods which are used to forecast the demand of avionics components is an important precondition to decrease multiple lead times in the F- 16 supply chain. The readily available database information {{should be used to}} this goal. The research objective of this research project is hence as follows: Develop a novel spare parts demand forecasting method in order to increase F- 16 avionics component availability by (1) evaluating state-of-the-art spare parts demand forecasting methods with the RNLAF time series demand data and (2) applying RNLAF data of component technical characteristics and component operational exposure in conjunction with the original historical demand data to improve selected method(s) Academic literature clearly stipulates that the methods of Croston, Syntetos, Babai and Teunter should be used to forecast intermittent demand. However, no literature has been found on how to improve these demand history based methods by using other data inputs like maintenance and operational history. Also, only limited literature was found about the extraction of demand drivers from databases. In short: A research opportunity is present. The developed conceptual model consists of five parts: Input (of demand, maintenance and operations data), steering variable (SV) <b>generator,</b> <b>forecast</b> method applier, stock level simulator and error minimizer. It is expected that stock level performance for avionics parts can be improved by (1) selecting the optimal forecast method, (2) selecting the optimal smoothing constants, (3) applying an SV deducted from installed base and/or FHRS per month variables. First, an optimal method and settings are established “in sample”. This ‘best fit’ is subsequently tested “out of sample” and compared to RNLAF stock levels to validate its performance. The installed base and FHRS per month variables are computed by combining two datasets and establishing install-removal intervals for a set of 110 unique components. The variables are translated into normalized and smoothed variables which are used to momentarily damp or gain the next estimate of the selected forecast method. Both installed base and FHRS per month variables are related to the utilization of components. An increase/decrease of the installed base (the total amount of installed components of a specific type at a specific time) or FHRS in a specific month for a component is expected to result in more/less defects of and hence demand for that component. A forecast optimization tool is built to implement the conceptual model. Enabling ease of experimentation by including many adjustable parameters and visualizing outputs to gain insights was of high priority throughout the development. The tool is capable of optimizing forecast methods and settings for all component demand inputs (110) in batch mode. The main output of the tool is exported in spreadsheet format. Analysis of the output of the forecast optimization tool resulted in the general conclusion that forecasting performance of the included forecast methods can be increased by using maintenance and operational data of the components, but the overall performance gain is small. In specific: SV information is used to generate better “in sample” forecast fits for approximately 50 % of the components demand forecasts for which installed base information was available. In those cases, the mean performance gain in relation to the conventional forecast mode is 17. 7 % for installed base SV mode and 12. 4 % for FHRS SV mode. For aperiod of six months out of sample, a percentage of 50. 0 % of the optimized installed base SV forecasts and 47. 9 % of the optimized FHRS SV forecasts still perform best and are therefore robust for the demand pattern of the specific components. The out of sample robust SV powered forecasts lead to performance gain for 20. 9 % of the components. The mean performance gains are 47. 7 % and 21. 3 % for installed base SV and FHRS SV modes respectively. The research project succeeded {{in the development of a}} model and method for forecast optimization using multiple sources of information in parallel to demand history. The research project addressed two novel aspects not yet covered in academic literature: (1) Batch optimization of the choice for a forecasting method and parameter settings in relation to the specific demand patterns. (2) Operationalize multiple predictive variables from maintenance and operations databases and integrate them in the forecasting method. The provided platform is not perfect but will confidently serve as a starting point for further innovative research. Air Transport & OperationsControl & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R
