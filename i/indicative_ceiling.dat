40|$|Axel Michaelowa’s paper {{addresses}} how {{the world}} should proceed in a post Kyoto Protocol period, which begins in 2013 but must be agreed before then. It is informative, ingenious, and constructive. But its proposal for extending emissions targets and enlarging the number of countries to which they apply is deeply flawed, partly by carrying forward the flaws inherent in the Kyoto Protocol (KP hereafter). This comment will address the intellectual framework of the proposal, identify three fatal flaws (all inherent in the Kyoto Protocol), and suggest an alternative approach. Michaelowa explicitly rejects a cost-benefit approach to public policy in dealing with global climate change {{in favor of an}} absolute (<b>indicative)</b> <b>ceiling</b> to atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, mainly but not exclusively carbon dioxide. This approach implies an extreme degree of risk aversion with respect to climate change – any cost to avoiding it is worth the price – about which every economist should be skeptical. Moreover, ordinary citizens will in practice reject this approach – they will not be willing to bear any cost to reduce emissions enough to stabilize concentrations. Policy analysts should acknowledge this from the outset. The price citizens will be willing to pay will initially be modest; it may grow as hard evidence of the costs of climate change accumulate, but even then it will not become infinite, not least because those who will be expected to bear the brunt of the cost of reducing emission...|$|E

40|$|From a {{very early}} point in the process, the team behind Arcadia was {{interested}} {{in a sense of}} realism to the design. The goal was to accurately land the show in time and space while giving the audience simple aesthetic picture so their focus could be on the language of the script. To serve that goal, the scenic design focused around attention to period architectural details specifically in the size an styles of the crown molding and wall details. An overhead element was designed that was not only <b>indicative</b> of coffered <b>ceilings</b> of the time but also blended in a level of mathematics imagery as well as the spiral movement that is mentioned throughout the script. Outside the large windows was kept very minimal using just a lit cyc and small ground row to help suggest the timelessness that occurs {{over the course of the}} play. For a moment of surprise at the end of the show, the walls were designed as translucent drops that could change appearance when lit from behind. For the vast majority of the show, the walls remained unchanged showing a soft organic texture on the front side. During the closing moments of the play, this texture would shift, revealing a darker, more chaotic pattern. This served to highlight the sense of chaos when thinking about the future as well as the fact that we can never really know everything about even the simplest things around us. This design reinforced my process in interpreting existing architecture and trying to replicate those items the best I could. The drafting stages underwent many revisions as I worked with layering molding and trim onto the walls as well as figuring out how best to construct said walls with appropriate structure while being able to effectively pull off the translucent effect.

40|$|Abstract This study {{examined}} memory functioning from a female perspective, {{with the aim}} of determining factors that might impact performance and render the accuracy of memory measurement, particularly with advancing age, problematic. Factors investigated, among others, were the role of attention and/or engagement with the memory tasks administered, state affect (i. e., positive and negative arousal) at time of testing, subjective memory appraisal, particularly in the domain of perceived memory self-efficacy (MSE), and the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by older post-menopausal women. Two experimental computer-based tests of episodic memory, Paired Associates (PA) and Serial Recall (SR), were administered to 181 female participants aged 18 to 86 years. The tasks were designed to emphasise components that make episodic memory especially difficult, and minimise the use of strategies that might assist recall. Thus, they varied the requirement for recall as opposed to recognition, the need to form an association between a pair of unrelated words, and the need to discriminate the most recent list from earlier list(s). Other measures used included a demographic survey administered to participants individually in an interview format, and a number of variables examined in this study derived from responses to items contained in this survey. The research battery also included psychometric measures of transient affective states, psychological well-being, alertness, in addition to measures of global cognitive status and metamemory (i. e., subjective memory appraisal). The overall aim was to examine a range of factors that might influence episodic memory performance in cognitively intact healthy women, and thus render the interpretation of age-related changes to memory functioning problematic. For analyses participants were assigned to three groups - young, middle-aged and older. There were 60 young adults aged 18 to 29 years, 60 middle-aged adults aged 49 to 60 years, and 61 older adults aged 61 to 86 years. Each participant was tested individually in a single session lasting approximately 3 ½ hours, with younger participants requiring less time to complete assessments. Order of test administration and instructions were standardised across the entire sample. Inferential statistics included correlation, t-test statistic, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey post-hoc comparisons. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine key correlates of memory performance outcomes. No significant differences between the cohorts were found in mean years of education. However, episodic memory recall differed significantly by age group. As expected, young adults recalled significantly more words in the memory tasks than their older counterparts, and middle-aged adults outperformed adults in the oldest cohort. Moreover, older adults’ performance deficits were more pronounced in the tasks requiring that they make an association between a pair of unrelated words. Across all cases, transient mood states were significantly related to memory scores; however, individuals in the oldest cohort were particularly vulnerable to mood fluctuations. This cohort experienced a significantly greater decline in positive affect and a significant greater increase in negative affect while undergoing memory testing, highlighting their greater vulnerability to stressors inherent in a memory testing situation. Although scores on the measure of attention were near <b>ceiling,</b> <b>indicative</b> of participants’ level of effort, motivation, and engagement with the memory tasks, the measure of attention discriminated between older and younger adults’ results, and was a key predictor of memory performance. Noteworthy is that attention scores significantly contributed to performance variability in younger and older adults but not in middle-aged adults. Across all cases, age, education, and attention were the key contributing factors to variability in memory scores. Although four lifestyle factors: (1) subjective sleep appraisal, (2) body mass index (BMI), (3) physical activity, and (4) caffeine intake were significantly associated with performance in the memory tasks, once the effects of these key variables were removed, lifestyle factor did not uniquely contribute to performance variability. Moreover, no association was found between hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and episodic memory performance across the broader sample. However, in a small subgroup of older women (n = 15, M age = 66 years), long-term users of this treatment, HRT had a significant effect on memory performance and was indicative of better recall on the memory tasks. The effect of subjective memory appraisal, MSE included, on objective performance outcomes was examined. The results showed that memory self-evaluations were not a significant contributing factor to episodic memory performance, confirming that memory self-appraisal is a poor predictor of actual memory performance, and thus does not pose a challenge to the measurement of age-related changes to memory abilities. Although there were commonalities, factors influencing memory performance differed by age cohort. For example, in young adults, positive mood, a perception of sleeping well, subjective health, and attention were significantly related to performance on the memory tasks. However, once the effect of attention was removed in the regression analysis, no other variable was predictive of episodic memory functioning in this cohort. In contrast, the single significant predictor of memory performance in middle-aged individuals was education, and neither attention, nor positive mood, or physical activity had a significant effect on this cohort’s performance. Similarly, having more years of formal education benefited older adults’ episodic memory functioning. However, high scores on global cognitive functioning and on the tasks measuring attention were equally important to episodic memory recall in this age group. In sum, the significant contribution of age to memory variability attested to the utility of the memory measures in detecting age-related changes to episodic memory functioning, which were independent of deficits in attention or level of education. Moreover, the effect of several factors (e. g., transient mood, lifestyle) on memory scores was explained by an effect on attention, and this has clear implication for the proper evaluation of long-term changes to memory functioning. Limitations of the study and suggestion for future research are discussed...|$|R
