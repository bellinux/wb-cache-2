5|$|The December 1975 {{murder of}} Jean Diggs and her four {{children}} has never been solved. Police reported in 1977 that they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> identify a perpetrator after two years and thousands of hours spent investigating the crime.|$|E
5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became evident {{that some of}} the other inbound flights were performing missed approaches, as they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> complete an instrument approach to the airport's runway. The airport is surrounded by high terrain on all sides and a fairly steep descent is required in order to land.|$|E
5|$|Furious {{that his}} army <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> take Moscow, Hitler {{dismissed}} his commander-in-chief, Walther von Brauchitsch, on 19 December 1941, and took personal {{charge of the}} Wehrmacht, effectively taking control of all military decisions. Additionally, Hitler surrounded himself with staff officers {{with little or no}} recent combat experience.|$|E

He ceased to be a monk in April 2012, stating that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> find a monastery to join due to his status as a former prisoner. He was re-arrested at least three times in 2012.|$|E
5|$|On 28 December 2009, Dhondup Wangchen {{was sentenced}} to six year's {{imprisonment}} for subversion, following a secret trial in Xining. On 7 January 2010, Filming for Tibet reported that he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> appeal his sentence {{because he had been}} denied access to his lawyer until his right to appeal expired.|$|E
5|$|Over 200 {{species of}} bird have been {{recorded}} in the area including black guillemot, eider, peregrine falcon and the golden eagle. In 1981 there were 28 ptarmigan on Arran, but in 2009 {{it was reported that}} extensive surveys <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> record any. Similarly, the red-billed chough no longer breeds on the island.|$|E

5|$|Serevi did not {{represent}} Fiji in sevens in 2003, being controversially omitted from Fiji's Hong Kong Sevens squad. Serevi <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> return to Fiji for a fitness test and national tournament due to commitments with his club Stade Montois in France. Because of this he was omitted from the team, despite being available {{to play in the}} tournament.|$|E
5|$|There {{was almost}} a return to F1 for Andretti at the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix when the Renault team put Mario on standby to replace regular driver Patrick Tambay if the Frenchman <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> race, {{as was the case}} at the {{previous}} race in Canada. However, in the event, Tambay was able {{to take part in the}} race.|$|E
5|$|After the {{appointment}} of Geoff Henke—who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> compete in 1956 after the administrators neglected to endorse his ice hockey team's application—as team manager in 1976, the results slowly began to improve, and by the 1990s, some Australians were regarded as medal prospects. The upturn in performance was accompanied by increased government funding for winter sports, {{the creation of the}} Olympic Winter Institute of Australia and the purchase of an alpine training base in Austria.|$|E

5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was keen {{to get him back}} to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative. Ironically, the script for Angels was one that Cagney had hoped to do while with Grand National, but the studio <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> secure funding.|$|E
5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of men who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, taking with her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{discovered}} in Weizsäcker's office, Fleischmann's laboratory and the Strasbourg Hospital pointed to nuclear activities {{taking place at}} Stadtilm, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and Tailfingen. After establishing its headquarters in von Haagen's office Alsos staff uncovered documents concerning secret medical experiments at Natzweiler concentration camp. These indicated the Germans <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> develop a practical process for uranium enrichment. For {{the first time the}} Alsos Mission was able to categorically report that the Germans did not have nuclear weapons, and would not have them for some time.|$|E

5|$|Five {{weeks before}} the {{outbreak}} of World War II, on 25 July 1939, in Warsaw, the Polish Cipher Bureau revealed its Enigma-decryption techniques and equipment to representatives of French and British military intelligence, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> make any headway against Enigma. This Polish intelligence-and-technology transfer would give the Allies an unprecedented advantage (Ultra) in their ultimately victorious prosecution of World War II.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1951–52, Barnes made {{a return}} to cricket, and sought {{selection}} in the national team to play the West Indies during the 1951–52 Australian season. Australia <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> find a reliable opener to accompany Barnes's former partner Arthur Morris. Australia's batsmen struggled {{in the first two}} Tests, and before the Third Test, Barnes scored 107 against Victoria, putting on 210 in partnership with Morris for New South Wales. The Sporting Globe in Melbourne had presciently predicted that the board would object if the selectors chose Barnes.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, it was {{reported}} that López Habas would leave the club due to concerns over his ₹2.35 crore ($350,000) annual salary. On 25 April, he left for Pune. On 3 May, he was replaced by another Spaniard, former Villarreal manager José Francisco Molina. Postiga returned to be the marquee again, but suffered another long-term injury early into the second game of the season. The club's ownership admitted that they had wanted a different marquee due to his record, but <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> sign one.|$|E

5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson {{referred to his}} two regrets in life. The first {{was that he had}} not been at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider. The second regret was {{that he and his wife}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable to explain the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> explain what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of a week, British forces {{evacuated}} approximately 500 entitled persons from Sierra Leone—almost 300 of whom left in the first two days of the operation. The arrival of British soldiers boosted morale in the country, and many foreign citizens opted to stay. The operation took on a slower pace after the first two days, but personnel and aircraft remained ready to evacuate any entitled persons who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> reach Freetown earlier and to evacuate the British High Commission if the security situation deteriorated.|$|E
