50|$|Neutral beam {{injection}} (NBI) is {{one method}} used to heat plasma inside a fusion device consisting in {{a beam of}} high-energy neutral particles that can enter the confinement magnetic field. When these neutral particles are ionized by collision with the plasma particles, they are kept in the plasma by the confining magnetic field, and can transfer most of their energy by further collisions with the plasma. By tangential injection in the torus, neutral beams provide also momentum to the plasma and current drive, one essential feature for long pulses of burning plasmas. Neutral beam injection is a ﬂexible and reliable technique, {{which has been the}} main heating system on a large variety of fusion devices. To date, all NBI systems were based on positive precursor ion beams. In the 90s there has been impressive progress in negative ion sources and accelerators with the construction of multi-megawatt negative ion based NBI systems at LHD (H0, 180 keV) and JT-60U (D0, 500 keV).

40|$|Attaining ignited plasmas in next-step tokamaks {{requires}} {{the avoidance of}} strong sawtooth activity in the plasma core. This has motivated studying correlations between observed sawtooth behaviour and theoretical models describing the effects of collisionless populations of ions on the internal kink mode. An energy principle approach has been developed which allows the kinetic effects of collisionless ions on MHD modes to be studied. The analysis accounts for linear wave-particle interaction, which in some cases is stabilising to the internal kink mode and in others destabilising. The stability boundary depends sensitively {{on the distribution of}} the collisionless population and the equilibrium. The recent Joint European Torus deuterium-tritium campaign has yielded <b>ion</b> <b>cyclotron</b> <b>resonance</b> <b>heated</b> (ICRH) pulses during which both the sawtooth characteristics and the ICRH minority ion population both evolve substantially. At multiple times during each pulse, the evolution of the kinetic-fluid MHD potential energy is calculated from measurement of the energetic ions and compared with the evolving sawtooth duration. It is shown that there is a strong correlation between sawtooth duration and minority ion stabilisation of the ideal internal kink. Thermal ions in the banana regime also give rise to significant deviations from the ideal MHD internal kink mode stability threshold. However, the behaviour of such ions are found {{to be sensitive to the}} equilibrium electric field and the induced sheared plasma rotation. An analysis is presented which includes the effects of the equilibrium electric field and plasma rotation. For changing levels of plasma rotation, the calculated critical pressure for internal kink displacements can change by a factor of two.
