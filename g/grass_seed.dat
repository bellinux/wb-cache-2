5|$|It was a mad waste. The colonists {{in their}} greed for more <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> and sheep pasture burned {{millions}} of pounds worth of timber. They recklessly destroyed the wonderful {{beauty of the}} bush, baring the soil until it was carried away by landslides, and lowered the rainfall, and laid waste the homes of countless sweet songsters.|$|E
5|$|The border clearers' {{task was}} aided unofficially by German civilians {{from both sides}} of the former border, who {{scavenged}} the installations for fencing, wire and blocks of concrete to use in home improvements. Much of the fence was sold to a West German scrap-metal company. Environmental groups undertook a programme of re-greening the border, planting new trees and sowing <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to fill in the clear-cut area along the line.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} from the fires began almost immediately, with plants such as fireweed appearing {{in a matter of}} days after a fire had passed. While surrounding national forests did some replanting and even dispersed <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> by airplane, the regeneration in Yellowstone was generally so complete that no replanting was even attempted. Though some small plants did not immediately reassume their pre-fire habitats, most did, and the vast majority of plants regrew from existing sprouts which survived the heat from the fires. There was a profusion of wildflowers in burned areas, especially between two and fiveyears after the fires.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{a higher}} {{percentage}} of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> (5.37 %) was found to be eaten during the dry period. This is probably due to the cereal stubble fields present in the study area and the applied method of separating large food pieces. Indeed, one hare stomach contained a huge piece of starch (16  g dry weight) by <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> that comprised 40.5 % of the total dry weight of the stomach content. A high percentage of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> (9 %) was also found in stomachs examined by Katona et al. (2010).|$|R

5|$|The corn crake's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} grassland, particularly hayfields, and it uses similar environments on the wintering grounds. This secretive species builds {{a nest of}} grass leaves in a hollow {{in the ground and}} lays 6–14 cream-coloured eggs which are covered with rufous blotches. These hatch in 19–20 days, and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks. This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed. The corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates, the occasional small frog or mammal, and plant material including <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> and cereal grain. Natural threats include introduced and feral mammals, large birds, various parasites and diseases.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's dissections and {{documentation}} of muscles, nerves, and vessels helped {{to describe the}} physiology and mechanics of movement. He attempted to identify the source of 'emotions' and their expression. He {{found it difficult to}} incorporate the prevailing system and theories of bodily humours, but eventually he abandoned these physiological explanations of bodily functions. He made the observations that humours were not located in cerebral spaces or ventricles. He documented that the humours were not contained in the heart or the liver, and that it was the heart that defined the circulatory system. He was the first to define atherosclerosis and liver cirrhosis. He created models of the cerebral ventricles with the use of melted wax and constructed a glass aorta to observe the circulation of blood through the aortic valve by using water and <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to watch flow patterns. Vesalius published his work on anatomy and physiology in De humani corporis fabrica in 1543.|$|E
25|$|Like other finches, the Gouldian finch is a seed eater. During the {{breeding}} season, Gouldian finches feed mostly on ripe or half-ripe grass seeds of sorghum. During the dry season, they forage {{on the ground}} for fallen seed. During the wet season, spinifex <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> (Triodia sp.) is an important component of their diet. So far Gouldians have been recorded as consuming six different species of <b>grass</b> <b>seed,</b> but during crop analysis, researchers have yet to find evidence of insect consumption.|$|E

Koolies are typically slightly longer than tall. The majority of owners prefer the short/smooth coats as they do not pick up <b>grass</b> <b>seed,</b> and are very easy to maintain, with the occasional swim to keep the coat glossy and free of parasites.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Geary began {{farming in}} the Medford area, {{where he had}} a {{commercial}} orchard. He later moved to Klamath Falls and began farming there. He founded the Geary Brothers Ranch near Upper Klamath Lake and managed the operation for many years, raising Hereford cattle and producing bentgrass seed. The Geary Ranch eventually {{became one of the}} largest commercial <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> producers in the world. Geary married Marian Howe in 1931. Together they had one daughter.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{establishment}} of the Oregon and California trails and Mormon settlement, Indians native to the Salt Lake Valley and adjacent areas lived by hunting buffalo and other game, but also gathered <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> from the bountiful grass of the area as well as roots {{such as those of}} the Indian Camas. By the time of settlement, indeed before 1840, the buffalo were gone from the valley, but hunting by settlers and grazing of cattle severely impacted the Indians in the area, and as settlement expanded into nearby river valleys and oases, indigenous tribes experienced increasing difficulty in gathering sufficient food. Brigham Young's counsel was to feed the hungry tribes, and that was done, but it was often not enough. These tensions formed the background to the Bear River massacre committed by California Militia stationed in Salt Lake City during the Civil War. The site of the massacre is just inside Preston, Idaho, but was generally thought to be within Utah at the time.|$|E

25|$|The {{staple foods}} then used by other American Indian tribes, corn and/or potatoes, would not grow without {{irrigation}} in the typically short three- to five-month wet season and nine- to seven-month dry seasons of California (see Mediterranean climate). Despite this, the natural abundance of California, {{and the environmental}} management techniques developed by California tribes over millennia, allowed for the highest population density in the Americas north of Mexico. Indians thrived by catching and eating deer, Tule elk, small game, fish, mollusks, <b>grass</b> <b>seed,</b> berries, insects, edible plants and roots, {{making it possible to}} sustain a subsistence hunter-gatherer economy without any agriculture. Without agriculture or migratory herds of animals or fish there are no known ways to support villages, towns or cities—small tribes and extended family groups are the typical hunter-gatherer grouping. A dietary staple for most Indian tribes in interior California was acorns, which were dried, shelled, ground to flour, roasted and soaked in water to leach out their tannin. The holes they ground into large rocks over centuries of use are still visible in many rocks today.|$|E
25|$|Yet, on the whole, {{it was an}} {{agricultural}} society without skill or resources. It committed all those sins which characterize a wasteful and ignorant husbandry. <b>Grass</b> <b>seed</b> was not sown for hay {{and as a result}} the farm animals had to forage for themselves in the forests; the fields were not permitted to lie in pasturage; a single crop was planted in the soil until the land was exhausted; the manure was not returned to the fields; {{only a small part of}} the farm was brought under cultivation, the rest being permitted to stand in timber. Instruments of cultivation were rude and clumsy and only too few, many of them being made on the farm. It is plain why the American frontier settler was on the move continually. It was, not his fear of a too close contact with the comforts and restraints of a civilized society that stirred him into a ceaseless activity, nor merely the chance of selling out at a profit to the coming wave of settlers; it was his wasting land that drove him on. Hunger was the goad. The pioneer farmer's ignorance, his inadequate facilities for cultivation, his limited means, of transport necessitated his frequent changes of scene. He could succeed only with virgin soil.|$|E

500|$|When {{he arrived}} in Kentucky, much of Breckinridge's land was {{occupied}} by tenant farmers whose leases had not yet expired. He planted rye and wheat on [...] of unleased land and sent 11 slaves and an overseer to clear land for the fall planting. Eventually, his crops at Cabell's Dale included corn, wheat, rye, barley, hay, <b>grass</b> <b>seed,</b> and hemp, {{but he refused to}} grow tobacco, a major cash crop, which he found too vulnerable to over-cultivation. He also bred thoroughbred horses, planted an orchard, and practiced law. He engaged in land speculation, particularly in the Northwest Territory, and at various times owned interests in iron and salt works, but these ventures were never very successful.|$|E
500|$|In 1964, {{drilling}} {{revealed that}} the Quehanna Wild Area's geology and hydrology made it unsuitable for burying waste. However, according to Seeley's Great Buffaloe Swamp, {{a history of the}} Quehanna region, there are 180contamination sites in the wild area. Waste has been found at the former air field, within the Wykoff Run Natural Area, near the industrial complex, at the former Lincoln Farm, and at the copper wire-burning site on the highway. These last three waste sites were cleaned in 1991 at a cost of $187,698. At the wire-burning site [...] of contaminated soil were removed from , with clean earth and <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> placed on top of the area.

500|$|The corn crake is omnivorous, {{but mainly}} feeds on invertebrates, {{including}} earthworms, slugs and snails, spiders, beetles, dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects. In the breeding areas, it is a predator of Sitona weevils, which infest legume crops. {{and in the}} past consumed large amounts of the former grassland pests, leatherjackets and wireworms. This crake will also eat small frogs and mammals, and plant material including <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> and cereal grain. Its diet on the wintering grounds is generally similar, but includes locally available items such as termites, cockroaches and dung beetles. Food is taken from the ground, low-growing plants and from inside grass tussocks; the crake may search leaf litter with its bill, and run in pursuit of active prey. Hunting is normally in cover, but, particularly in the wintering areas, it will occasionally feed on grassy tracks or dirt roads. Indigestible material is regurgitated as [...] pellets. Chicks are fed mainly on animal food, and when fully grown they may fly with the parents up to [...] to visit supplementary feeding areas. As with other rails, grit is swallowed to help break up food in the stomach.|$|E
