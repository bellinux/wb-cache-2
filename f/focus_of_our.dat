Whereas consequentialist theories posit that consequences of action should be the primary <b>focus</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> thinking about ethics, virtue ethics insists {{that it is the}} character rather than the consequences of actions that should be the focal point. Some virtue ethicists hold that consequentialist theories totally disregard the development and importance of moral character.

In reply to McCarthy, Thernstrom clarified her opinion by stating that [...] "I still have questions about DOJ's conduct, and I remain interested in knowing more about why the department declined to pursue the case."

30|$|Left {{ventricular}} (LV) remodeling is {{a complex}} pathophysiologic process characterized by changes at molecular, cellular and tissue level (Dixon and Spinale 2011). These changes result in cardiac dilatation and deterioration of LV function, {{and contribute to the}} onset and progression of heart failure (Pfeffer and Braunwald 1990). Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug that has proven to be effective in suppressing arrhythmias in heart failure patients, without increasing sudden cardiac death (Bardy et al. 2005). However, the impact of chronic amiodarone therapy on myocardial fibrosis and adverse LV remodeling remains unclear (Djandjighian et al. 2000; Tachikawa et al. 2005; Hu et al. 2004; Massie et al. 1996; Cleland et al. 1987; Hirasawa et al. 2009). We therefore sought to investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term amiodarone administration in a porcine model of ischemic cardiomyopathy. Given that amiodarone is known to promote interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (Jackevicius et al. 2011; Schwaiblmair et al. 2010; Papiris et al. 2010), the effect of chronic amiodarone administration on myocardial fibrosis was one <b>of</b> the main <b>focuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> investigation.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{examined}} effects of bank consolidations {{on the financial}} system, using the data on the Japanese banking industry before the Second World War, when the first bank merger wave occurred. The <b>focuses</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> analysis are the governance structure and performance of banks. With respect to the governance structure, we found that consolidations had an effect of excluding the unfavorable director interlocking between banks and the related firms, especially, {{in the case of}} absorbing consolidations (the consolidation where one participant was dominant). This finding is significant, because it sheds light on the process in which "related lending" or "insider lending," pervasive in the countries {{in the early stages of}} economic development, disappears. Concerning the performance of banks, we confirmed that consolidations had a positive impact on deposit growth, while they did not have an effect to enhance bank profitability. The positive impact on deposit growth was significant for the stability of the financial system in prewar Japan, because due to the lack the deposit insurance system, the financial system was continuously exposed to the risk of bank run. ...|$|R

We are exploring various designs for a sub-surface MRI system suitable for imaging these displays and other objects to a depth of 10 mm and greater in non-ferromagnetic proton-rich media. Using an innovative approach that leverages the post-acquisition subsystems of a commercial NMR spectrometer has dramatically reduced our development time and our research support costs.
