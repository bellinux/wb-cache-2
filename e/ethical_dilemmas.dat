By studying the international company collapses {{as a result of}} accounting issues, it determined areas for improvement within organizations as well as recommendations for companies to develop more effective ethics codes. The report also recommended that companies pursue options that would improve training and support so accountants could better handle <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemmas.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the work carried out by {{accountants}} and auditors requires a high level of ethics. Shareholders, potential shareholders, and other users of the financial statements rely heavily on the yearly financial statements of a company as they can use this information to make an informed decision about investment. They rely on the opinion of the accountants who prepared the statements, as well as the auditors that verified it, to present a true and fair view of the company. Knowledge of ethics can help accountants and auditors to overcome <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemmas,</b> allowing for the right choice that, although it may not benefit the company, will benefit the public who relies on the accountant/auditor's reporting.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{typically}} follows Bauer, {{officials in}} the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind {{the events of the}} day, often simultaneously. 24 is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving into the private lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemmas.</b> Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men — one of whom possesses crucial information — are dying in a room with only one surgeon.|$|E

25|$|As well, many of Aristotle’s {{conclusions}} directly oppose {{those of}} twentieth century narratologists such as Vladimir Propp, who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not {{of human beings}} but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”. Propp also argues that basic story elements, which he defines as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are {{defined in terms of}} a character who has specific ethical qualities”. Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in Poetics because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemmas.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{work with}} cadavers had aroused some opposition, {{primarily}} from religious institutions, it was grudgingly accepted because the dead, being dead, felt no pain, and {{the indignity of}} their situations was directly related to easing {{the pain of the}} living. Animal research, on the other hand, aroused much greater passion. Animal rights groups such as the ASPCA were vehement in their protest, and while researchers such as Patrick supported animal testing because of its ability to produce reliable, applicable data, there was nonetheless a strong ethical unease about this process. Researchers at the University of Virginia have to call the cadaver's family and tell them what they are using their loved one for, after getting consent from the family. This seems to lessen <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemmas</b> in contrast to animal testing, because there is no sufficient way to get consent to use an animal.|$|E

Madgulkar voiced Rama's personal <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemmas</b> (in [...] "Vālīvadh Nā, Khalnidrālan" [...] and [...] "Līnate, Cārūte, Sīte") along with his courage (in [...] "Nabhā Bhedunī Nād Chālale"), and steadfastness (in [...] "Līnate, Cārūte, Sīte").

He was shown to be distracted at the loss Sita (in [...] "Koṭhe Sītā Janakanandinī?"), and wailed in Lakshmana's presence (in [...] "Hī Ticyā Veṇitil Phule").

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} case study of a {{mathematics}} teacher and an English teacher integrating education for sustainability into their curriculum through <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemma</b> story pedagogy and co-teaching. The teachers identified a popular picture book and a well-known traditional Australian ballad as the starting point for their shared journey into curriculum integration and education for sustainability. The investigation formed part of a three-year longitudinal project funded by the Australian Research Council (ARC) focusing on <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemma</b> story pedagogy as a tool for integrating education for sustainability and values education into mainstream classrooms. The multi-paradigmatic methodology of the inquiry combined in-depth ethnography consisting of participant observation and teacher and student interviews with the Values Learning Environment Survey (VLES). Elisabeth’s and Peter’s (first/ second author) role was that of professional development facilitators, mentors and researchers. The results of this case study suggest that <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemma</b> pedagogy offers teachers an effective tool for integrating education for sustainability into subjects such as mathematics and English as well as for successful curriculum integration across subject boundaries. Teacher interviews highlighted opportunities for synthesis and mutual professional learning despite some difficulties in relation to organisational aspects of curriculum integration, such as time-tabling, shared assessments and shared programming. Student interviews illustrated the potential of <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemma</b> stories to engage students in critical thinking and critical reflection and in a critical discourse about sustainability issues.

[...] Researchers would thus face an <b>ethical</b> <b>dilemma</b> if they wanted to continue the study and collect more evidence, but had compelling evidence that one of the tested therapies was superior.
