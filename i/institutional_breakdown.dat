50|$|The {{domestic}} {{level of}} analysis locates causes {{in the character of}} the domestic system of specific states. Thus, war is caused by aggressive or warlike states, not by evil, inept, or misguided people or the structure of power in the international system. The failure of domestic institutions may also cause war. In World War I, the internal collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or the brittle coalition inside Germany of agricultural and industrial interest, such as rye and iron, are often cited as important causes. Domestic level cases may come from various characteristics of the domestic system. Capitalist and socialist economies generate different attitudes and behavior. The Muslim and Christian religions or democratic and nondemocratic political ideologies do as well. Stable and failed institutions are domestic level factors affecting state behavior. A great worry today is the existence of failed states, meaning states whose domestic institutions have broken down, such as Somalia. Another worry is here existence of a rogue state, such as North Korea, which may pass nuclear weapons on to terrorists. Any type of state come from the domestic {{level of analysis}}, but a failed state usually means an <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> at domestic level of analysis, whereas a rogue state often implies evil intentions by individual - individual level of analysis.|$|E
40|$|Using {{the logic}} of a {{two-phase}} cooperation framework (first bargaining to reach an agreement, then enforcement of the negotiated agree-ment), this article examines how the risk of <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> can help promote international cooperation. I argue first {{that the risk of}} <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> can help promote bargaining cooperation by raising the opportunity costs of bargaining failure, thus providing a strong incentive for states who value the fragile international institution to negotiate a cooperative agreement. Having helped states to reach a cooperative bargain, the risk of <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> can also {{play a role in the}} subsequent enforcement phase. I argue second that the risk of valued <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> can reduce state preferences for defection, moving the enforcement problem away from the standard Prisoners ’ Dilemma structure.

Three case studies were theoretically sampled in relation to each other. They yielded mainly qualitative data from methods that included interviews, observations, participant observations, and document reviews. Each case consisted of a boundaried cluster of small enterprises that were not industry specific and were geographically dispersed. Overall findings describe how an event, i. e. a stimulus, causes disruption, which in turn may cause pressure. Pressure is then translated as a tension within the institutional environment, which is characterized by opposing forces that encourage <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> and institutional maintenance. Several contributions are made: Deinstitutionalization as a process is inextricable from the formation of institutions – both are needed {{to make sense of}} institutional change on a conceptual level but are also inseparable experientially in the field; stimuli are conceptually different to pressures; the historical basis of a stimulus may impact on whether pressure and institutional change occurs; pressure exists in a more dynamic capacity rather than only as a catalyst; <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> is a non-linear irregular process; ethical and survival pressures as new types were identified; institutional current, as an underpinning mechanism, influences how the tension between <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> and maintenance plays out...|$|E

Given that price margins are narrow, traders and cargo operators tend {{to opt out of}} markets where the process of goods clearance is slow and costly. Excess paperwork and slow customs dispatch not only lead to <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdowns</b> and corruption but also to increasing transaction cost and trade constraints. The objective of this paper is, therefore, two-fold: First, to evaluate the relationship between institutional and infrastructural performance indexes and trade growth in container throughput; and, second, to investigate the causes for differences in container demurrage and detention fees in Latin American countries (using other emerging countries as benchmarking). The analysis is focused on manufactured goods, typically transported by containers. Institutional and infrastructure bottlenecks and, therefore, the country logistics efficiency – measured by the Logistics Performance Index (LPI, World Bank-WB) – are compared with other indexes, such as the Doing Business index (WB) and the Corruption Perception Index (Transparency International). The main results based on the comparison between Latin American countries and the others emerging countries point out in that the growth in containers trade is directly related to LPI performance. It has also been found that the main hypothesis is valid as aspects that more specifically identify trade facilitation and corruption are significant drivers of logistics performance. The exam of port efficiency (demurrage and detention fees) has demonstrated that not necessarily higher level of efficiency is related to lower charges; however, reductions in fees have been more significant within non-Latin American emerging countries...|$|R

40|$|Rehabilitation and {{reconstruction}} {{of social and}} economic infrastructure in a post-conflict environment are complex and long-debated issues in development cooperation. Both in pre-conflict and post-conflict situations, deepening chaos and disorder {{can be found at the}} highest social, economic and political levels, and serious development challenges remain insufficiently addressed. After almost a decade of the war in Kosovo, the providers of infrastructure services for the disaster affected, returning communities are faced with multifaceted problems characterised by a fragile society with political, economic and <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdowns.</b> Planning and implementing reconstruction projects in areas that are affected by conflict has proven to be far more challenging than expected, and has often been considered to be a feeble response from practitioners, aid agencies and government. In addition, genuine community-level involvement in post-conflict planning and decision-making for programs are central to any process for empowerment. With the presence of multiple donors and aid organisations, making informed decisions about complex multifaceted solutions, promoting good governance and better allocation of scarce resources are required to achieve a good outcome in a post-war situation. This also entails having a clearer focus and understanding of planning and implementation of post-war reconstruction projects and programs, thereby leading to nation building. The concept of managing post-conflict reconstruction and development projects according to internationally-accepted project management processes is a relatively new and developing field. The current study looked at how the planning and execution of post-conflict reconstruction and development projects in Kosovo could be used to develop a conceptual framework with which to design projects and programs that would be more likely to yield positive outcomes for society. The impetus for the study was to examine the planning and implementation challenges of rebuilding the economic infrastructure projects by agencies capable of supporting a stable society and economy in these complex, peace-building initiatives. In order to structure the complex question of post-conflict reconstruction and development projects in a more systematic way, a conceptual framework for planning and implementing projects was developed to help rebuild communities in post-conflict settings. The use of mixed method approaches was designed to explore and confirm the research questions, as well as help in understanding the phenomena in the social, cultural and governance context within the project development practice of multilateral agencies in Kosovo. Using a detailed case study approach to the interviews and survey data, the study not only identified program strengths and weaknesses of the current project management processes, but also identified the differences of opinion within the project team in project planning and implementation in their wider sense. The findings of the study identified a poor quality of planning and implementation of reconstruction projects in an environment of complexity, change and uncertainty. The interpretation of respondents’ data shows that there remain considerable challenges in Kosovo’s reconstruction of key infrastructure. There is evidence that both aid organisations’ constructed project management processes and international aid agencies practices do not work effectively in a community service delivery setting. However, the study raised some very significant findings for a broader approach to community involvement in project identification, planning and implementation. The study showed that there continue to be differences in project communication, cost, quality, procurement and risk management. Finally, the study’s findings demonstrated that success in post-conflict reconstruction depends on the ability to understand the full complexities of the political environment, as well as the ability to coordinate peace-building operations in an effective manner...|$|R

40|$|How do {{we explain}} {{divergent}} trajectories {{of change in}} wage bargaining institutions? The advancement of European economic integration, leading to markets liberalisation and increased competition, was expected to bring the breakdown of centralised bargaining arrangements. This expectation was even stronger given the internationalisation of new management practices, pushing European firms to enhance their competitiveness via increasing flexibility. Despite strong theoretical expectations towards a generalised breakdown of wage bargaining, one finds divergent trajectories of change across European countries and sectors. The task of this thesis is to explain the puzzle of varied responses in otherwise similar sectors. Banking and telecommunications sectors in Italy and Greece display a diversity of paths of <b>institutional</b> change: <b>breakdown</b> of bargaining, reform of bargaining, successful centralisation, and failed centralisation. The direction of the paths of institutional change may be explained {{in large part by}} two factors ignored by earlier literature: ‘employer associability’ and ‘labourstate coalitions’. On the one hand, it is argued that employers associations which possess the legal competence and take into account the collective interests of both large and smaller firms, may reform the wage bargaining institution, getting the ‘best of both worlds’ for their members. Additionally, a ‘labour-state coalition’ may moderate the destabilising pressures to wage bargaining, as long as trade unions are able to speak with a ‘single voice’. The government will not only be motivated by electoral concerns, but also support centralised bargaining to gain ‘room for manoeuvre’ for tactical policy trade-offs advancing its agenda. Overall, the thesis refines earlier propositions, suggesting a more nuanced causal mechanism to explain institutional change. The argument speaks to wider debates in comparative political economy and comparative employment systems; it fleshes out empirically {{the role of the state}} in Mediterranean capitalism and highlights factors that moderate pressures to convergence to the Liberal Market model.

40|$|Although {{interest}} in the structure and relational features of social capital and its underlying networks has grown since the early 1990 s, the terms do not embody any ideas that are really new to sociologists, but are indeed rather new to economists. Until the 1950 s, land, labour, and financial capital (i. e., levels of investment) were seen as being relevant for economic growth. Then technology (physical capital) {{was added to the}} list. In the early 1960 s, convincing empirical evidence showed that labour without know-how and entrepreneurial skills (human capital) limit the potential of the other production factors. Today, labour and skills are usually simultaneously addressed when talking of human capital. In development economics, and more recently in main-stream and transition economics, social capital is more and more considered an important capital asset for the welfare of individuals and communities. Already in the early 1990 s, development economics postulated the so-called capital asset pentagon that comprises the mainstream economic production factors, as well as social capital (see figure below). The potential of compensating the lack of one capital asset with the existence of another was seen as important for maintaining a sustainable livelihood. It is also important to note that human capital resides in individuals and social capital in relationships (WOOLCOCK, 2001). As literate and informed people are better able to organize, evaluate and transform information, human and social capital assets are complements. In addition, social capital can supplement meagre levels of other capital assets. Capital asset pentagon of the sustainable livelihood framework: During the transformation process of transition countries in the 1990 s, the tremendous <b>institutional</b> changes and <b>breakdowns</b> in {{the public and private sectors}} further accelerated {{interest in}} social capital. Public service institutions such as kindergartens or farm extension services were closed and rural communities with social capital could compensate for this by collective actions. The emergence of a relatively flourishing microfinance sector in urban and rural areas is proof of the power of tapping social networks when public and private banks refrain from servicing the poorer segments of the population. This edited volume tries to bring together academics in Germany who have an outspoken interest in conducting research on social capital and the underlying network in a rural context. The volume starts out with two conceptual and methodological contributions, one by BUCHENRIEDER and DUFHUES and another by BUCHENRIEDER, which pave the way for a better understanding of the empirical contributions. The contributions by DUFHUES and BUCHENRIEDER and WOLZ, FRITZSCH and REINSBERG discuss methodological issues to operationalise social capital as a parameter in econometric analyses. While DUFHUES and BUCHENRIEDER address the issue based on interpersonal relationships and propose methods to model networks, WOLZ, FRITZSCH and REINSBERG construct a factor from the observance of structured social capital in rural areas of the Czech Republic. They find that some forms of structured social capital contribute to total farm output. In this sense, social capital drives total factor productivity, which is in line with what DASGUPTA (2002) claimed, and can be considered a new production factor. KASARJYAN and KORFF use a networkcentred approach to assess the effects of strong and weak ties on having access to rural microcredit in Armenia in a situation where the formal financial market fails. Interestingly, it is mostly bonding social capital that determines access. Clearly, as the rural financial market develops in Armenia, access to rural credit has to go beyond family and friendship ties. Finally, BEUCHELT and FISCHER describe how rural households in Vietnam manage risk based on their five capital assets. Normally, financial, physical and natural capital assets are already stretched to their limits and it is the social capital that has to be called upon when an income shock hits. However, social capital is more developed in the better-off households than in the very poor households. Therefore, it can be concluded from the empirical contributions in this volume that access to social capital is not a panacea for rural economic development under difficult societal, economic and political conditions. Nevertheless, interpersonal networks of social capital can help to ease socio-economic hardship when the state and market fail to do their share.

We identify, moreover, four types of readings of the pedagogic innovation – interpretative, instrumental, inversive and reflexive. The findings also reveal three distinct forms of tradition vocabularies employed in the university administration of pedagogic innovation – breach concerns, redress articulation and reintegration epistemology. Overall, the findings contribute to a more sophisticated understanding of the ‘past in the present’ in the workings of university traditions in the everyday consumption of pedagogic innovation...|$|E

The analysis of conflict and violence in Karachi presented here focuses on the processes that made Karachi an open city - openness to migration and informality.

It has perpetrated the greatest default in world economic history, yet if the foreign assets of its private individuals are included in the national accounts, the country is still a net creditor. These gross asymmetries and apparent inconsistencies suggest that Argentina’s financial troubles must be attributed to her own political processes rather than to adverse circumstances or foreign scapegoats.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to show that}} while environmental shocks can lead to major institutional change, typically this change is not radical. Even in situations of <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown,</b> due to violent and disruptive events such as disasters, {{it is possible to}} find institutional persistence which constraints and shapes the process of change. In this sense, the paper portrays institutional change and institutional persistence more as coexisting than as contrasting. Focusing on the nuclear accident at Three Mile Island (1979), which "ended the first nuclear era in the U. S. (Weinberg, 1985 : 1) "divided nuclear power history in two parts [...] before and after Three Mile Island (Rees, 1994 : l), the paper examines forms of major institutional change that originated from it, but have also revealed themselves as consistent with institutional persistence. A new path in nuclear safety regulation developed near the accident at Three Mile Island (TMI). Yet, this new path has been consistent with an old path in nuclear safety regulation that TMI did not break down, and to a certain extent strengthened. Emphasizing institutional persistence, the paper takes a historical perspective, paying attention both to the long-term institutional implications of the nuclear plant accident at TMI, and to its historical roots. History represents a basic framework for understanding the kind of institutional transformation developed in nuclear safety regulation after TMI. The U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is the main institution we investigate in this paper. The NRC is a case of institutional continuity in itself. It was established in 1974, but it inherited its structure, staff and regulatory system from its predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) established in 1946. The paper looks at the process of the NRC's transformation that developed because of TMI. That transformation has been constrained and mediated by the AEC's institutional legacy. A second institution we focus on is nuclear safety regulation. The whole concept of nuclear safety, its culture and approach have changed because of TMI. The main <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> that TMI produced was precisely in the body of assumptions, values, rules and procedures which had guided nuclear safety regulation until then. The paper then describes and analyzes the main changes which took place in the institutional environment of the NRC as a result of TMI. More specifically, the paper focuses on the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations (INPO), the private regulatory agency set up by the nuclear industry in the afermath of TMI, and on its partnership with the NRC. The INPO itself, and especially the partnership between INPO and NRC, represent a major institutional change in nuclear safety regulation.

Scenario developers integrate stakeholder perceptions into storylines to increase scenario relevance and plausibility while relying on archetypes of change from scenario literature to enrich narratives. This research examines {{the contributions of}} local perspectives and global archetypes to scenario development through {{a case study of}} a regional scenario project, Yahara 2070, in Wisconsin, USA. Interviews with 50 Yahara watershed stakeholders and 5 members of the project's scenario development team were examined to compare themes from scenario archetypes with local perspectives on how change is expected to occur. We next examined how these two sources of inspiration for trajectories of change were used {{in the development of the}} Yahara 2070 scenarios. Both global archetypes and local stakeholders emphasized social values, market forces, and policy reform as influences in determining the future, which were reflected in Yahara 2070. However, stakeholders were less likely to mention <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown,</b> an important theme from the global scenarios literature that was included in Yahara 2070. This research offers a new approach to analyzing similarities and differences between scenarios' narratives and local perspectives. Scenario development may involve tensions between the goals of reflecting stakeholder views and including narratives from the global scenarios literature that may be useful for creating divergent model trajectories and addressing dramatic change into the future. To improve scenario development, scenario projects should document the development process in academic and nonacademic venues, explicitly highlighting sources and constraints in storyline development...|$|E
30|$|Entrepreneurship {{is often}} {{considered}} a significant tool {{for economic growth}} {{and the development of}} a country, as entrepreneurship generates employment opportunities and has positive impacts on innovation and public welfare (Acs et al. 2008). This is why; entrepreneurship works as the main driver of the economic development of lower- and middle-income countries (Anokhin et al. 2008). Consequently, a lower- to middle-income economy, better known as a developing economy, may be economically supported by entrepreneurial activities. Developing economies can obtain high levels of economic growth, resulting in a high number of opportunity-driven entrepreneurs (Naude 2009), and this high number of opportunity-driven entrepreneurs can ensure more entrepreneurial activities in these economies (Wong et al. 2005). However, in reality high-growth entrepreneurial activities are not widespread in many developing economies. Munemo (2012) found less entrepreneurial activity in many developing economies that have political instability, more specifically in African economies. These limited and specific entrepreneurial activities are commonly considered a reason for institutional breakdowns (Naude 2010). The obstacles of entrepreneurial development and <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> create an opportunity to introduce more social entrepreneurship. If governments in developing economies fail to establish social institutions, then social entrepreneurship may play a key role in creating social values (Mair and Marti 2009). This key role of social entrepreneurship facilitates the search for business opportunities and the creation of social values in an organization (Haugh 2005). Professor Yunus, pioneer of the Social Business building, says a business model for a social enterprise can convert inputs into outcomes, generating both social and economic value for everyone, including the poor people at the bottom of the pyramid, who are usually left out.|$|E
40|$|This book {{presents}} original {{research by}} an international group of scholars on the social history of Russia across the period of World War I, the 1917 revolutions, and the Civil War. The essays document how the inhabitants of Russia’s multinational empire mobilized in 1914 {{in response to the}} myriad demands of what many called the “Second Patriotic War. ” They created ambitious new projects as well as adapting existing institutions to meet the military and social needs of total war, and increasingly cited their contributions to support claims for a greater political voice. As the authors demonstrate, the war offered unprecedented opportunities for engagement to groups previously on the margins of civil society, such as women and national minorities. The fall of the tsarist government in early 1917 reinvigorated the movement for social mobilization and renewal, now focused on advancing not only the war effort but also Russia’s new democratic order. The sweeping changes of this period inspired patriotism, hope, and idealism in many on Russia’s home front. But as this collection also shows, the violence, social disruption, and <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> produced by war and revolution damaged existing social networks and sowed anxiety, disillusionment, and despair. As revolution degenerated into civil war, Russians turned increasingly to devising strategies for survival. The editors of The Experience of War and Revolution hope that these innovative essays will encourage other scholars to study the social impact of total war and revolution, the grassroots mobilization of Russian society during this period, and the methods of adaptation and self-reinvention adopted by ordinary men and women in response to prolonged crisis. The Experience of War and Revolution is the second of four books in the volume Russia’s Home Front in War and Revolution, 1914 – 22. All four books constitute volume 3 of the broader centennial series on “Russia’s Great War and Revolution, 1914 – 22. ...|$|E
40|$|Common {{property}} regimes (CPRs) {{have been}} embraced {{as a means}} to achieve sustainable use of resources. However, it is also claimed that these and other forms of communal resource management can allow for equitable access to resources, which is of some importance given the heavier reliance of poorer households on common resources. This view however appears to be contradicted by the existence of wealth differentiation among resource users, suggesting that the reality is more complex. This case study of a local pastoral commons used by Kazak herders in western Mongolia explores factors influencing both access to resources and wealth differentiation, which has been considerable since the end of socialism and attempts to evaluate the extent to which resource access in the CPR can be considered equitable. There is differential resource access in the study community, both in terms of rights of access, with some inequities linked to non-wealth-related household characteristics, {{and in terms of the}} ability to realise nominal access rights, which is chiefly affected by relative wealth. Although allocation of access rights is not discriminatory, the interrelationship between wealth and resource access thus serves to reinforce wealth differentiation. Wealth differentiation itself however depends on multiple factors including but not limited to resource access, and does not reliably indicate inequitable access to resources. The case study indicates that CPRs cannot be considered inherently equitable, but that instead equity in resource access is affected by social differentiation in the user group. In addition, where factors considered necessary to successful collective action are wanting, equitable outcomes seem less likely. Thus most inequities in access rights date back to privatisation in Mongolia and the resulting <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> and lack of user participation both in allocation of resources and in devising appropriate resource access rules. Despite this, evidence from both the case study and other pastoral commons suggests that CPRs may still offer more equitable access to resources than do other types of property regime...|$|E
40|$|The Scottish Parliament which (re) {{convened in}} 1999 was {{designed}} to engender a new style of political practice. This ‘new politics’ was intended to address perceived failures within the ‘Westminster approach’ to policy‐making and the ‘democratic deficit’ believed to have emerged during the 1980 s in Scotland. Key to achieving this were four principles around which the Parliament’s operations were designed: power‐sharing; accountability; accessibility and participation; and equal opportunities. Citing accessibility and participation as the ‘cornerstone’ of their work, the Parliament’s institutional architects (the Consultative Steering Group) argued that devolution should deliver a participatory democracy, with proactive efforts {{to be made by}} the Parliament to involve groups traditionally excluded from the policy process. Due to the increasing prominence in recent years of discourse relating to young people’s disillusionment with organised politics and the CSG’s recommendation that every effort should be made to include them in the new Parliament’s work, this research examines the degree to which greater accessibility to and participation in the Parliament’s work has been delivered for children and young people during the Parliament’s first two terms (1999 ‐ 2007). Findings are based upon a mixed‐methodological case‐study approach, involving an audit of the Parliament's activity and qualitative input from MSPs, Parliament staff, representatives of youth charities / organisations / advocacy groups, and young people themselves. The thesis argues that progress has been more pronounced in relation to accessibility than participation for younger people. The neoinstitutionalist theoretical framework suggests that insufficient rule specification in relation to the value of public participation and younger people has resulted in the emergence of hybridised logics of appropriate behaviour, particularly among parliamentarians. The result is the persistence of attitudes and practices which appear to reinforce aspects of Westminster practice and an adultist approach to young people’s role in politics. Drawing upon recent developments in neoinstitutionalist theories of reliable reproduction, <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> and gradual change, the thesis examines the institutional logic behind the failure to consolidate the Parliament’s founding vision.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} North Korean state {{formation}} during the period 1945 to 1950. I have attempted to explicate the structural constraints and opportunities of North Korean state formation; resources and capabilities the North Korean state makers obtained; strategies and policies they employed; the interaction of domestic and international factors; and {{similarities and differences between}} North Korea 2 ̆ 7 s experiences with state formation and those of the Eastern European countries. ^ I have combined theories of state formation with a conceptual framework based on an actor-structure relationship and conducted a thorough investigation of the North Korean records seized by U. S. forces during the Korean War and the intelligence reports of U. S. army forces and U. S. military advisory group in Korea. ^ I have examined the party and state apparatuses, security and military forces, agriculture, labor, industry, state budgets and finance, and united front and popular elections. I have interpreted North Korean state formation in terms of the progress of the Kim Il Sung group toward attaining coercive, war-making, and resource-extracting capabilities within the favorable political opportunity structure provided by the Soviet Union. ^ The most salient feature of North Korean state formation was the Soviet Union 2 ̆ 7 s close supervision of the entire process of the creation of the new state. All the major policies and strategies of Kim Il Sung were within the purview of Soviet geopolitical strategic objectives and economic interests in North Korea. The Soviet advisors and the North Korean state makers copied the Soviet experience faithfully as the guideline for North Korean state formation, but on a more refined, selective basis. Another salient characteristic was the minimum societal resistance to the state-making activities of Kim Il Sung in the domestic realm, owing to the 2 ̆ 2 exit 2 ̆ 2 of most of the landlords, industrial capitalists, and Christians to South Korea. ^ Contrasts between processes of state formation in North Korea and the Eastern European countries are found in pre-existing <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown,</b> societal resistance. the character of Soviet objectives in each area, and the international structural context surrounding both regions. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} rural livelihoods in two contrasting environments {{in the upper}} and lower reaches of the Gariep River: Sehlabathebe in the Lesotho highlands, and the Richtersveld in the Northern Cape, and how these have changed over time. Livelihoods were examined using the Sustainable Livelihoods Framework in conjunction with the household development cycle. This study therefore adopted a multi-scale approach, where a micro-level household analysis was framed within the macro level social, political, environmental, economic and institutional context, while taking into account the role of temporal scale of livelihood change. A multi-scale approach facilitated the identification of the major drivers of change, both exogenous and endogenous. The combination of livelihood strategies pursued differed between the two sites. Households in Sehlabathebe are reliant mainly on arable and garden cultivation, livestock in some households, occasional remittances, use of wild resources, petty trading and reliance on donations. Households in the Richtersveld relied primarily on livestock, wage labour, use of wild resources and State grants or pensions. The livelihood strategies pursued in each site have not changed markedly over time, but rather the relative importance of those strategies was found to have changed. The assets available to households, the livelihood strategies adopted and the changes in these livelihood strategies are influenced by a households stage in the development cycle and differing macro-level factors. Drivers of change operate at multiple spatial and temporal scales, and are often complex and interrelated. The major drivers of livelihood change were identified as macro-economic, demographic, institutional and social and climatic. This study highlights the importance of using historical analysis in the study of livelihoods, as well as the complexity and diversity of rural livelihoods. Ecosystem goods and services were found to play a fundamental role in rural livelihoods and are influenced by institutional factors. Rural households are heavily reliant on the formal economy, and macro-economic changes have {{had a significant impact on}} livelihoods. This is highlighted by how the drastic decline in migrant labour opportunities for households in Sehlabathebe has negatively affected them. Vulnerability was shown to be a result of external shocks and trends, such as institutional transformation, a decline in employment opportunities, theft and climatic variation; and differed between the two sites. The role of <b>institutional</b> <b>breakdown</b> was shown to be a major factor influencing rural livelihoods, and this is related to broader economic and political changes. This study contributes to the growing literature on rural livelihoods by allowing for an appreciation of how differing environments and contextual factors influence livelihood strategies adopted, and which different factors are driving change. ...|$|E
