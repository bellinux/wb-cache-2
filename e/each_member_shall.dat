5000|$|In 1912, the People's Power League, led by William S. U'Ren, {{proposed}} {{an amendment to}} the Oregon Constitution to allow each legislator to cast a number of votes equal to the number of votes he received in the last election. Thus, a legislator who received 25,000 votes would have had more voting power than two legislators who received 12,000 votes apiece. A majority of all the votes cast at the preceding election would have been required to pass a law. This proposal would have abolished the Oregon Senate and placed the state's legislative power in a single assembly of sixty members serving four-year terms. The Governor of Oregon and his defeated rivals would have been ex officio members of the Assembly representing voters whose candidate was defeated. If a Socialist legislative candidate were defeated, for instance, then the votes of his supporters would have been cast in the Assembly by the Socialist candidate for Governor. The measure failed by a vote of 71,183 to 31,020. That same year, a similar measure was contained in a proposed new Portland charter called The Short Charter. Article 22 provided simply, [...] "A majority of all the votes cast at the election and represented in the commission, as in this article provided, shall be necessary to pass any measure. Each member of the commission shall represent in the commission the voters who elected him; and in voting on any ordinance, resolution, charter amendment, or other roll-call in the commission, <b>each</b> <b>member</b> <b>shall</b> cast the number of votes for or against the same by which he was elected." ...|$|E

In this framework, the concentrations of uranium and thorium decay series, {{as well as of}} 40 K were measured in soil, sludge and oil sand samples collected in the Kuçova oilfield (Albania) by using a high resolution gamma-ray spectrometer (HPGe). The levels of radioactivity in soil samples were found to be comparable with the world mean activity concentrations. Oil sand samples showed the highest 40 K and 226 Ra activity concentrations, indicating the presence of shale traps, which are generally rich in natural radionuclides. No strong evidences on disequilibrium were observed from the ratio of 228 Th and 228 Ra activity concentrations. The concentration of radionuclides in produced water and crude oil were found to be minimum detectable activities.

40|$|Some {{countries}} with small nuclear power programmes in the expanded European Union {{may not have}} the resources or the full range of expertise to build their own repositories for long-lived radioactive wastes. For these countries it is sensible to consider an option of shared deep disposal facilities. The prospect of regional solutions is raised in the draft of the EC radioactive waste Directive to be adopted by May 2004. The directive assumes that <b>Each</b> <b>Member</b> State <b>shall</b> establish a clearly defined programme for radioactive waste management that includes all radioactive waste under its jurisdiction and covers all stages of management including disposal. Even some milestones to be incorporated into national waste management programmes are given in the Directive together with very demanding deadlines. The national programmes may also include export of radioactive waste or spent fuel under certain conditions. The presented paper contains an analysis of the Directive provisions, which could lead to the need for regional repositories in Europe. Recognizing the need to pave the way to regional European repositories, ARIUS (Association for Regional and International Underground Storage) together with DECOM Slovakia submitted a proposal for a project within 6 th Framework Programme named SAPIERR (Support Action: Pilot Initiative for European Regional Repositories). Acknowledging the importance of the proposed project in the framework of the above Directive, the evaluators of the European Commission judged SAPIERR positively and invited the proponents to contractual negotiations.

Sweden {{has established}} a less ambitious target of 1. 7 % annual energy intensity improvement through 2020. The aim {{of this paper is}} to evaluate, ex-ante, the EU 2020 primary energy target for the Swedish industrial sector. An applied backcasting methodology is used. The assessment made in this paper is that actions that lead to between 31. 6 and 33. 2  TWh/year reductions in energy end-use are needed if the EU target is to be achieved. Results from this paper shows that the current energy policy instruments are not sufficient to the EU or Swedish targets. Estimations in this paper are that a primary energy target of about 22. 3  TWh/year is reasonable. The paper concludes by presenting a roadmap on how the Swedish 2020 target can be achieved through: i) energy management; ii) energy-efficient technology; and iii) energy supply measures, with an approximate cost of 280 – 300 MEUR or 75 – 80  kWh per public EUR. Three major additional policy measures are needed compared with the current policy: including all energy carriers, not just electricity, in the Swedish long-term agreements program PFE; setting up networks; and making it possible for third parties, i. e., industry, to deliver excess heat into the monopolized Swedish district heating grids...|$|R
