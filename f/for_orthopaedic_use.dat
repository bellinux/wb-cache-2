40|$|A {{fundamental}} orthopaedic problem to-day is {{the understanding}} of the fate of bone transplants. Since homogenous preserved bone is increasingly used, this study investigated the survival of the calcifying mechanism under storage conditions typically employed in preserving homogenous bone <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>use.</b> It was our hope that the method might be used to indicate the relative value of the various means of preserving bone. The enhancement ofthe value ofthe preserved bone used in transplantation by reactivating the calcifying mechanism presented another subject of inquiry. Calcification in vitro of the hypertrophic epiphysial cartilage of rachitic rat tibiae was employed in this study. This method is a useful indication of “ local factors “ involved in calcification. The appearance of new calcification depends on the functioning of the complete system essential for mineralisation. This method is a valid one {{for the purpose of this}} investigation, for the histological appearance of calcification in vitro of the hypertrophic epiphysial cartilage resembles that obtained in calcification in vivo. New mineral deposits occur in the matri...|$|E

Prof. Miloš Janeček, Ph. D. Abstract: Titanium alloys {{belong to the}} mostly used biomaterials for orthopaedic implants. Advanced surface treatments of Ti alloys <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>use</b> and newly developed biomedical beta-Ti alloys are investigated in this thesis. Wide spectrum of experimental techniques was employed in order to correlate material processing, microstructure and mechanical properties. Electric discharge machining {{was used as a}} biocompatibility enhancing surface treatment of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy, but the treated material suffered from the poor fatigue performance. Two subsequent surface treatments - chemical etching and shot- peening - were proposed and it was shown that their combination significantly improves the fatigue performance of the material making it applicable in orthopaedics. This process was patented in the Czech Republic. The thesis further reviews complex problematic of biocompatible beta-Ti alloys. Several new biocompatible beta-Ti alloys were designed on the basis of Ti-Nb-Zr-Ta quaternary alloy. The effect of Fe, Si and O additions on microstructure, elastic modulus and [...] ...|$|E

Therefore, the aim of this study is to determine the influence of irradiation sterilization on a range of premixed CPC 2 ̆ 7 s, with an emphasis on improving product shelf life through the use of optimal packaging configurations and annealing steps. Electron spin resonance (ESR) confirmed the presence of free radicals in the inorganic phase of the CPC paste following irradiation. The inclusion of a 24 -h annealing step was the only successful method in reducing the degree of free radical formation. Based on the results of injectability force testing, it was revealed that an annealing step greater than 24 -h significantly altered the viscosity, however; at 24 -h the key attributes of the CPC paste were minimally effected. Overall, it was established that vacuum packing the CPC paste, placing the contents into a foil pouch, gamma irradiating at the minimal dose required and using an annealing step of ≤ 24 -h, has the potential to extend the shelf life of the cement...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate if foot joint damage due to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) can predict whether patients will start wearing orthopaedic shoes (OS) within 10 years after treatment start. Data from recent onset RA patients with 10 years follow-up from the BeSt (Dutch acronym for treatment strategies) study were used. Treatment was tightly controlled, targeted at disease activity score (DAS) ≤ 2. 4, according to 1 of 4 pre-specified treatment strategies. After 10 years of follow-up, <b>orthopaedic</b> shoe <b>use</b> was recorded in 285 / 508 patients (responders to questionnaires at 10 years). Between-group differences <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> shoe users and non-users were calculated at baseline, after 10 years, and change scores over the 10 -year period were calculated. Predictors <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> shoe <b>use</b> were identified by univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses. <b>Orthopaedic</b> shoe <b>use</b> was reported by 57 / 285 patients after 10 years. Orthopaedic shoe users had more joint damage, joint swelling and pain in the feet already at baseline and after 10 years. At both time points, DAS of orthopaedic shoe users and non-users was similar. Multivariable logistic regression showed that dichotomized foot erosions score (cut-off ≥ 1 erosion) (OR 2. 42), anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA) (OR 4. 64) and DAS (OR 1. 77) were independent predictors of <b>orthopaedic</b> shoe <b>use.</b> Despite intensive targeted treatment, 57 / 285 recent onset RA patients started <b>using</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> shoes over 10 year of follow-up.

The {{aim of this}} study was to prepare sphene coating on titanium alloy (Ti- 6 Al- 4 V) <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> applications <b>using</b> the plasma spray method. The phase composition, surface and interface microstructure, coating thickness, surface roughness and bonding strength of the plasma-sprayed sphene coating were analysed using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and the standard mechanical testing of the American Society for Testing and Materials, respectively. The results indicated that sphene coating was obtained with a uniform and dense microstructure at the interface of the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V surface and the thickness and surface roughness of the coating were approximately 150 and 10  μm, respectively. Plasma-sprayed sphene coating on Ti- 6 Al- 4 V possessed a significantly improved bonding strength and chemical stability compared with plasma-sprayed hydroxyapatite (HAp) coating. Plasma-sprayed sphene coating supported human osteoblast-like cell (HOB) attachment and significantly enhanced HOB proliferation and differentiation compared with plasma-sprayed HAp coating and uncoated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V.

40|$|Human mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs), which can {{generate}} both osteoblasts and chondrocytes, represent an ideal resource <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> repair <b>using</b> tissue-engineering approaches. One major difficulty {{for the development}} of osteochondral constructs using undifferentiated MSCs is that serum is typically used in culture protocols to promote differentiation of the osteogenic component, whereas existing chondrogenic differentiation protocols rely on the use of serum-free conditions. In order to define conditions which could be compatible with both chondrogenic and osteogenic differentiation in a single bioreactor, we have analysed the efficiency of new biphasic differentiation regimes based on transient serum exposure followed by serum-free treatment. MSC differentiation was assessed either in serum-free medium or with a range of transient exposure to serum, and compared to continuous serum-containing treatment. Although osteogenic differentation was not supported in the complete absence of serum, marker expression and extensive mineralization analyses established that 5 days of transient exposure triggered a level of differentiation comparable to that observed when serum was present throughout. This initial phase of serum exposure was further shown to support the successful chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, comparable to controls maintained in serum-free conditions throughout. This study indicates that a culture based on temporal serum exposure followed by serum-free treatment is compatible with both osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs. These results will allow the development of novel strategies for osteochondral tissue engineering approaches using MSCs for regenerative medicine...|$|R
40|$|This article {{approaches}} {{the methodology of}} designing customized footwear for high arched foot. The authors propose to reconsider the classical structure of footwear bottom components for people with high arched foot and recommend incorporating custom components, {{with the role of}} compensation or adjustment. This study continues the authors’ research, starting from a foot’s 3 D shape obtained by 3 D scanning, the anthropometrical and biomechanical parameters, shoe lasts’ 3 D modelling and continuing with 3 D footwear design. Including customized orthosis can help to stop the evolution of abnormalities, diminishes sensations of pain during walking and improves performance in various physical activities carried out during the day, walking, running, and standing. The prophylactic footwear has to meet four main requirements: to protect the foot and ankle during walking and static; to ensure the normal resistance systems (bones), muscle and joint of the foot; to prevent the installation of irreversible structural changes by reducing stress on the foot; to contribute to increased performance in conducting regular physical activity. It is presented the steps of modelling an orthosis, a virtual simulation of its cutting process, followed by the integration and development of the insole, filling and sole for a customized shoe.

40|$|Standard {{surgical}} {{repair of}} intertrochanteric hip fractures requires accurate placement of a wire across the fracture using static fluoroscopic images. Few practice methods exist for perfecting this wire navigation skill outside the operating room. The {{objective of this}} research is to further understand skill development <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> drilling <b>using</b> a validated simulator, enabling more effective instruction and training. This includes the investigation of the relationship between practice and skill acquisition in conjunction with specific differences between experts and novices. This work details the creation and validation of an augmented reality wire navigation simulator <b>for</b> training <b>orthopaedic</b> drilling. This novel augmented reality simulator combines real-world objects, such as a surgical drill and synthetic bone, with virtually generated, radiation-free radiographic imaging. The central hypothesis is that an augmented reality wire navigation simulator will demonstrate construct validity and improve orthopaedic drilling skill through simulation training. This work identifies the differentiation of skill between experienced surgeons and novices completing the wire navigation task, demonstrating construct validity for the developed simulator. It also demonstrates that experienced surgeons are more accurate than novices in orthopaedic drilling (F(2, 39) = 3. 721, p = 0. 033). This provides evidence supporting the simulator 2 ̆ 7 s construct validity and value as a training and assessment tool in wire navigation of the proximal femur. Although the study was unsuccessful in providing sufficient evidence that training on the simulator directly transfers to more realistic drilling tasks, it revealed several discoveries about acquiring wire navigation skill. This work establishes a relationship between skill acquisition and practice for the wire navigation task. This learning curve shows that skill acquisition occurs much more slowly in wire navigation than previously assumed. The wire accuracy (i. e., tip-apex distance) is predicted to improve 0. 1 to 0. 3 millimeters with each successive practice repetition of the wire navigation task (95...|$|R

40|$|International audienceChlorapatite can be {{considered}} a potential biomaterial <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> applications. Its <b>use</b> as plasma-sprayed coating could be of interest considering its thermal properties and particularly its ability to melt without decomposition unlike hydroxyapatite. Chlorapatite (ClA) was synthesized by a high-temperature ion exchange reaction starting from commercial stoichiometric hydroxyapatites apatite (HA). The ClA powder obtained showed similar characteristics as the original industrial HA powder, and was obtained in the monoclinic form. The HA and ClA powders were plasma-sprayed using a low-energy plasma spraying system with identical processing parameters. The coatings were characterized by physical-chemical methods, i. e. X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy, including distribution mapping of the main phases detected such as amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP), oxyapatite (OA), and HA or ClA. The unexpected formation of oxyapatite in ClA coatings was assigned to a side reaction with contaminating oxygenated species (O 2, H 2 O). ClA coatings exhibited characteristics different from HA, showing a lower content of oxyapatite and amorphous phase. Although their adhesion strength was found to be lower than that of HA coatings, their application could be an interesting alternative, offering, in particular, a larger range of spraying conditions without formation of massive impurities...|$|R

The present review focuses on corrosion, biocompatibility and surface modifications of biodegradable Mg alloys <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> applications. Initially, the corrosion behaviour of Mg alloys {{and the effect}} of alloying elements on corrosion and biocompatibility is discussed. Furthermore, the influence of polymeric deposit coatings, namely sol-gel, synthetic aliphatic polyesters and natural polymers on corrosion and biological performance of Mg and its alloy <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> applications are presented. It was found that inclusion of alloying elements such as Al, Mn, Ca, Zn and rare earth elements provides improved corrosion resistance to Mg alloys. It has been also observed that sol-gel and synthetic aliphatic polyesters based coatings exhibit improved corrosion resistance as compared to natural polymers, which has higher biocompatibility due to their biomimetic nature.

40|$|Abstract: The loss of bone {{integrity}} {{can significantly}} compromise the aesthetics and mobility {{of patients and}} can be treated <b>using</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> implants. Over the past decades; various orthopaedic implants; such as allografts; xenografts and synthetic materials; have been developed and widely used in clinical practice. However; most of these materials lack intrinsic osteoinductivity and thus cannot induce bone formation. Consequently; osteoinductive functionalisation of orthopaedic implants is needed to promote local osteogenesis and implant osteointegration. For this purpose; bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -functionalised coatings {{have proven to be}} a simple and effective strategy. In this review; we summarise the current knowledge and recent advances regarding BMP-functionalised coatings <b>for</b> <b>orthopaedic</b> implants...|$|R

40|$|Background. Degenerative {{disorders}} of {{the foot}} often are painful during standing and walking. It is assumed that, because of bone deformity, callus, and deformity of the plantar pads, the plantar pressure distribution changes. Prescription of <b>orthopaedic</b> shoes <b>for</b> patients with degenerative disorders {{of the foot}} {{is based on the}} hypothesis that excessive pressure under the foot causes pain. The goal {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effectiveness of custom-made orthopaedic shoes, in terms of pressure and pain, in patients with degenerative disorders of the foot. Additionally, the relationship between plantar pressure parameters and foot pain was studied, with special emphasis on second and third metatarsal heads. Methods: Seventy-seven consecutive patients with degenerative disorders of the foot were recruited from the outpatient clinics of seven rehabilitation centers and rehabilitation departments of university hospitals in the Netherlands. The study was prospective. The Questionnaire for Usability Evaluation <b>for</b> <b>Orthopaedic</b> Shoes was <b>used</b> to measure perceived foot pain. To measure plantar pressures, the Pedar in-shoe pressure measurement system (Novel GmbH, Munich) was used. The effectiveness of custom-made orthopaedic shoes, in terms of pressure and pain in patients with degenerative disorders of the foot, was analyzed by means of a paired sample t-test. To select the pressure parameter (Pmax, P-TI, and P-av) most closely associated with walking pain, within-subject correlation coefficients were calculated. Results: Custom-made orthopaedic shoes significantly decreased perceived foot pain by at least 23 %, and significantly reduced plantar pressure under all foot regions by at least 9 %. A significant correlation (r = 0. 521) was found between walking pain and the average pressure beneath the second and third metatarsal heads. Conclusions: Based on these results, it can be concluded that custom-made orthopaedic shoes are effective in reducing foot pain and foot pressure. The moderate (significant) relationship between average pressure and walking pain can be used as a tool <b>for</b> evaluating custom-made <b>orthopaedic</b> shoes prescribed <b>for</b> patients with degenerative disorders of the foot...|$|R
