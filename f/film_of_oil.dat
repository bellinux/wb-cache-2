25|$|The surface-to-volume-ratio in {{the moving}} {{combustion}} chamber is so complex that a direct comparison cannot {{be made between}} a reciprocating piston engine and a Wankel engine. The flow velocity and the heat losses are quite different. Surface temperature characteristics are completely different; the <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> in the Wankel engine acts as insulation. Engines with a higher compression ratio have a worse surface-to-volume ratio. The surface-to-volume ratio of a reciprocating piston diesel engine is much poorer than a reciprocating piston gasoline engine, but diesel engines have a higher efficiency factor. Hence, comparing power outputs is a realistic metric. A reciprocating piston engine with equal power to a Wankel will be approximately twice the displacement. When comparing the power-to-weight ratio, physical size or physical weight to a similar power output piston engine, the Wankel is superior.|$|E

25|$|The lipid {{nature of}} the cell {{membrane}} was first correctly intuited by Quincke, who noted that a cell generally forms a spherical shape in water and, when broken in half, forms two smaller spheres. The only other known material to exhibit this behavior was oil. He also noted that a thin <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> behaves as a semipermeable membrane, precisely as predicted. Based on these observations, Quincke asserted that the cell membrane comprised a fluid layer of fat less than 100nm thick. This theory was further extended by evidence {{from the study of}} anesthetics. Hans Meyer and Ernest Overton independently noticed that the chemicals which act as general anesthetics are also those soluble in both water and oil. They interpreted this as meaning that to pass the cell membrane a molecule must be at least sparingly soluble in oil, their “lipoid theory of narcosis.” Based on this evidence and further experiments, they concluded that the cell membrane might be made of lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) and cholesterol. Interestingly, one of the early criticisms of this theory was that it included no mechanism for energy-dependent selective transport. This “flaw” would remain unanswered for nearly half a century until the discovery that specialized molecules called integral membrane proteins can act as ion transportation pumps.|$|E
2500|$|All Mazda-made Wankel rotaries, {{including}} the Renesis {{found in the}} RX-8, burn a small quantity of oil by design, metered into the combustion chamber to preserve the apex seals. Owners must periodically add small amounts of oil, thereby increasing running costs. Some sources, such as rotaryeng.net, claim that better results come {{with the use of}} an oil-in-fuel mixture rather than an oil metering pump. Liquid-cooled engines require a mineral multigrade oil for cold starts, and Wankel engines need a warm-up time before full load operation as reciprocating engines do. All engines exhibit oil loss, but the rotary engine is engineered with a sealed motor, unlike a piston engine that has a <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil</b> that splashes {{on the walls of the}} cylinder to lubricate them, hence an oil [...] "control" [...] ring. No-oil-loss engines have been developed, eliminating much of the oil lubrication problem.|$|E

5000|$|Structural {{color is}} {{studied in the}} field of {{thin-film}} optics. A layman's term that describes particularly the most ordered or the most changeable structural colors is iridescence. Structural color is responsible for the blues and greens of the feathers of many birds (the blue jay, for example), as well as certain butterfly wings and beetle shells. Variations in the pattern's spacing often give rise to an iridescent effect, as seen in peacock feathers, soap bubbles, <b>films</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> and mother <b>of</b> pearl, because the reflected color depends upon the viewing angle. Numerous scientists have carried out research in butterfly wings and beetle shells, including Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke.

40|$|Thin <b>films</b> <b>of</b> crude <b>oil</b> {{samples were}} {{prepared}} for atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis on the gold substrate. Sample preparation involved evaporation during a long (24 h) but mild thermal exposure (80 degrees C). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microscopy (reflectance spectroscopy) was employed to determinate the quality <b>of</b> the thin <b>film</b> surface, before the morphology characterization.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} {{of what is}} known as the imperfect junction coherer. The principle of operation (microwelding) suggested above for the filings coherer may be less likely to apply to this type because there is no need for decohering. An iron and mercury variation on this device was used by Marconi for the first transatlantic radio message. An earlier form was invented by Jagdish Chandra Bose in 1899. The device consisted of a small metallic cup containing a pool of mercury covered by a very thin insulating film of oil; above the surface of the oil, a small iron disc is suspended. By means of an adjusting screw the lower edge of the disc is made to touch the oil-covered mercury with a pressure small enough not to puncture the <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil.</b> Its principle of operation is not well understood. The action of detection occurs when the radio frequency signal somehow breaks down the insulating <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>oil,</b> allowing the device to conduct, operating the receiving sounder wired in series. This form of coherer is self-restoring and needs no decohering.|$|E
