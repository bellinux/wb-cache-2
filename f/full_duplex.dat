40|$|AbstractWe have {{investigated}} the kinetics of DNA hybridization to oligonucleotide arrays on high-capacity porous silica films that were deposited by two techniques. Films created by spin coating pure colloidal silica suspensions onto a substrate had pores of ∼ 23 nm, relatively low porosity (35 %), and a surface area of 17 times flat glass (for a 0. 3 -μm film). In the second method, latex particles were codeposited with the silica by spin coating and then pyrolyzed, which resulted in larger pores (36 nm), higher porosity (65 %), and higher surface area (26 times flat glass for a 0. 3 -μm film). As {{a result of these}} favorable properties, the templated silica hybridized more quickly and reached a higher adsorbed target density (11 vs. 8 times flat glass at 22 °C) than the pure silica. Adsorption of DNA onto the high-capacity films is controlled by traditional adsorption and desorption coefficients, as well as by morphology factors and transient binding interactions between the target and the probes. To describe these effects, we have developed a model based on the analogy to diffusion of a reactant in a porous catalyst. Adsorption values (ka, kd, and K) measured on planar arrays for the same probe/target system provide the parameters for the model and also provide an internally consistent comparison for the stability of the transient complexes. The interpretation of the model takes into account factors not previously considered for hybridization in three-dimensional films, including the potential effects of heterogeneous probe populations, partial probe/target complexes during diffusion, and non- 1 : 1 binding structures. The transient complexes are much less stable than <b>full</b> <b>duplexes</b> (binding constants for <b>full</b> <b>duplexes</b> higher by three orders of magnitude or more), which may be a result of the unique probe density and distribution that is characteristic of the photolithographically patterned arrays. The behavior at 22 °C is described well by the predictive equations for morphology, whereas the behavior at 45 °C deviates from expectations and suggests that more complex phenomena may be occurring in that temperature regime...|$|R

Dibenzo[a,l]pyrene (DB[a,l]P) is a highly tumorigenic six-ring PAH, which contains a nonplanar and aromatic fjord region that is absent in the structurally related bay region five-ring PAH benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P). The PAH diol epoxide−DNA adducts formed include the stereoisomeric 14 S and 14 R trans-anti-DB[a,l]P-N 2 -dG and the stereochemically analogous 10 S- and 10 R-B[a]P-N 2 -dG (B[a]P-dG) guanine adducts.

40|$|In a <b>full</b> <b>duplexing</b> (FD) {{wireless}} cellular network, a {{base station}} operates in FD mode, while the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) users operate in half duplexing (HD) mode. Thus, the downlink and uplink transmissions occur simultaneously so that interuser interference from a UL to a DL user occurs. In an FD network, the main challenge {{to minimize the}} interuser interference is user pairing, which determines a pair of DL and UL users who use the same radio resource simultaneously. We formulate a nonconvex optimization problem for user pairing to maximize the cell throughput. Then, we propose a heuristic user pairing algorithm with low complexity. This algorithm is designed such that the DL user having a better signal quality has higher priority to choose its paired UL user for throughput maximization. Thereafter, we conduct theoretical performance analysis of the FD cellular system based on stochastic geometry and analyze {{the impact of the}} user paring algorithm on the performance of the FD cellular system. Results show that the FD system that uses the proposed user pairing algorithm effectively reduces the interuser interference and approaches optimal performance. It also considerably outperforms the FD system using a random user pairing and almost doubles the conventional HD system in terms of cell throughput...|$|R

40|$|This thesis mainly {{focuses on}} the higher layer {{protocol}} design for optical wireless communication (OWC) networks in two different optical bands: (1) medium access control (MAC) protocol design and neighbor discovery methods for deep ultraviolet (UV) outdoor communications (UVOC), and (2) configuration of indoor visible light communication (VLC) networks. For UVOC, solar blind and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) operations are attractive. Light beams from UV light-emitting diode (LED) arrays propagate through scattering media, creating spatially different communication links. This unique physical (PHY) layer characteristic was first captured experimentally based on a UV testbed, from which mathematical signal propagation models were developed {{and their impact on}} MAC design was realized, i. e., <b>full</b> <b>duplexing</b> and multi-rate transmission. Then we propose a novel contention-based MAC protocol (UVOC-MAC) that inherently accounts for the UV PHY layer and fully exploits multi-fold spatial reuse opportunities. Evaluations via simulation and analysis show that UVOC-MAC effectively mitigates collisions and achieves high throughput. We further develop efficient neighbor discovery protocols by accounting for the varying channel qualities along different scattering directions. Besides a list of neighbor nodes' identities, a ranked list of node pointing directions in terms of channel qualities was also included in the constructed table to facilitate the process. Utilizing neighbor feedback or alternating a leader node were proved to be able to alleviate the negative effects of random access based collisions and thus expedite neighbor discovery. VLC by lighting LEDs is gaining popularity, but there is very limited research on the higher layer protocol design. Our extensive channel measurements using a physical layer testbed suggest two effective means to increase data rates, shrinking the beam width and tuning the transmission beam to point towards a target receiver. We design a configuration framework called VICO, by leveraging above PHY features towards achieving the highest throughput while maintaining fairness. VICO tries to schedule transmissions while minimizing conflicts of links. It also opportunistically tunes the idle LEDs to reinforce existing transmissions to increase throughput to the extent possible. Under these proposed treatments, VICO can provide as much as 5 -fold increase in throughput as compared to a simple scheduler that does not exploit the possible variations in beamwidth or beam-angle...|$|R
