25|$|On December 7, 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> mutual excommunication against Catholic and Orthodox {{which had}} been in force since the Great Schism of 1054.|$|E
500|$|... "The lion didn't do {{anything}} {{he was supposed to}} do, and I ended up leaning against this pillar with his head in my crotch... I {{thought he was going to}} take a bite out of me so <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> veil I was wearing and had a stare-down with him and he opened his mouth and let out this huge roar. I got so frightened my heart fell in my shoe. When he finally walked away, the director yelled 'Cut' and I had to take a long breather. But I could really relate to the lion. I feel like in a past life I was a lion or a cat or something." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> breakfast cover, and {{saw before}} me a damnatory red herring.|$|E
60|$|And now <b>I</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> curtain {{that hangs}} {{between here and}} No-man's-land. Will you come with me, sweet Reader? I thank you. Give me your hand.|$|R
6000|$|... 8 [...] The {{little one}} sleeps in its cradle, [...] <b>I</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies [...] with my hand.|$|R
50|$|Imagine {{grains of}} sand in a bag. <b>I</b> can <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> bag when it {{contains}} one grain of sand. If <b>I</b> can <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> bag with N {{grains of sand}} then <b>I</b> can certainly <b>lift</b> it with N+1 grains of sand (for it is absurd to think <b>I</b> can <b>lift</b> N grains but adding a single grain makes it too heavy to <b>lift).</b> Therefore, <b>I</b> can <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> bag when it has any number of grains of sand, even if it has five tons of sand.|$|R
60|$|But <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> apron. ‘Why, it’s “The Master of Ballantrae!”’ I exclaimed, shocked.|$|E
60|$|But at length, dismissing {{all such}} folly, {{at least from}} my face, <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> trap-door and descended the steep ladder into the room beneath.|$|E
60|$|As I waited, <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> unopened {{newspaper}} {{from the}} table and glanced my eye over it. It rested upon a heading which sent a chill to my heart.|$|E
6000|$|Small mirth was in <b>the</b> making--now <b>I</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> cloth that cloaks the clay, And, wearied, at thy feet I lay My wares, ere I {{go forth}} to sell. The long bazar will praise, but thou-- Heart of my heart--have I done well? ...|$|R
6000|$|Wine {{comes in}} at the mouth [...] And love comes {{in at the}} eye; [...] That's all we shall know for truth [...] Before we grow old and die. [...] <b>I</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> glass to my mouth, [...] I look at you, and I sigh.|$|R
6000|$|Small mirth {{was in the}} making. Now [...] <b>I</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> cloth that cloaks the clay, [...] And, wearied, at Thy feet I lay [...] My wares ere I {{go forth}} to sell. [...] The long bazar will praise--but Thou-- [...] Heart of my heart, have I done well? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{passed on}} to the gate and stooped down. <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> heavy head, put the long dank hair aside, and turned the face. And it was my mother, cold and dead.|$|E
60|$|When I {{reached the}} little house on the point I saw the lamp still burning wanly in the window. A quick alarm struck at my heart. Without waiting to knock, <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> latch, and entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look {{forth and}} view the night!" [...] was her cry; and when <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> heavy blind from the {{casement}} close at hand--with her own royal gesture, {{she showed me}} a moon supreme, in an element deep and splendid.|$|E
5000|$|After Emperor Nicholas <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> Peter <b>the</b> Great's {{prohibition}} {{to construct}} bridges across the Neva, a temporary pontoon bridge {{was set up}} about 50 metres downstream from the current structure.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>I</b> will <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> drill up gently, Bertie; do you kneel down, {{and when}} I stop, {{take hold of}} it close to the floor, {{so that we may}} see the {{thickness}} of the stone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Huck, I always {{reckoned}} we'd get it. It's {{just too}} good to believe, but we HAVE got it, sure! Say--let's not fool around here. Let's snake it out. Lemme see if <b>I</b> can <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> box." ...|$|R
60|$|My arrival saved Mr. Marx from {{a speedy}} death by strangulation. Though <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> lunatic {{up in my}} arms and {{strained}} every muscle to pull him away, his fingers never relaxed till I stopped his breath and rendered him momentarily unconscious.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> paper up and {{saw that}} the chest was divided into two compartments. Lying on the top of one was a small, square, inlaid box. This Mrs. DeLisle took up and carried to the window. Lifting up the cover she laid it in my lap.|$|E
60|$|Never {{mind what}} I said, but I assure you {{if it had}} not been for Dick's arm I should have gone under the table, when, a few minutes later, <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> blue velvet lid and saw a dainty watch luxuriously lying on its white satin bed.|$|E
5000|$|A statue {{was inaugurated}} in the Parc de la Tete d'Or by the presidents with {{inspiration}} on the saying by Archimedes [...] "Give me a lever {{long enough and}} a place to stand and <b>I</b> could <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> world." ...|$|R
40|$|Here 2 ̆ 7 s what I tell myself: I 2 ̆ 7 m a mime {{and this}} town is the {{invisible}} box that I only pretend to be stuck in. Its boundaries are wherever I press the flat of my hand. Look, I 2 ̆ 7 m trapped! Look, now I trace a window with my burglar gloves and peek through. Now <b>I</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> window, climb through, and escape. Now I 2 ̆ 7 m juggling. Now I 2 ̆ 7 m dancing. Now the invisible box disappears. It never existed. Ha ha ha...|$|R
60|$|I {{went through}} the dreary house, and darkened the windows. The windows of the chamber where he lay, I darkened last. <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> up <b>the</b> leaden hand, and held it to my heart; and all the world seemed death and silence, broken only by his mother's moaning.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> heavy rifle. I got {{the sights}} dead on {{to a certain}} spot {{at the back of}} that red cave. I pressed the trigger; the charge boomed--and nothing happened! I heard no bullet strike and Jana did not even take the trouble to close his mouth.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> latch {{and opened}} the door. It gave access at once to the single plain living-room. There, all was huddled. For a moment my eyes hardly took in the truth. There are sights so sickening that the brain at the first shock wholly fails to realise them.|$|E
6000|$|There it was, {{the same}} as ever. <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> gate-latch; the gate was locked. We ran to the carriage-gate; that was locked too. Just then I noticed a placard on the fence; it was not printed, but the {{lettering}} was large, apparently made with ink and a brush. It read: ...|$|E
60|$|I hesitated till <b>I</b> saw Marama <b>lifting</b> <b>the</b> heavy wooden spear {{he carried}} and remembered that I was unarmed. Then I came out.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> my hand. <b>The</b> servant ran between us. [...] "For God's sake, control yourself, sir! We mean no harm. It's only to tell Mr. Toller {{that his}} boat is missing." ...|$|R
50|$|On 7 December 1965, a Joint Catholic-Orthodox Declaration of Pope Paul VI and the Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras <b>I</b> {{was issued}} <b>lifting</b> <b>the</b> mutual excommunications of 1054.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> {{pistol and}} {{appeared}} to cover the figure with much care. As I did so, even from that distance I thought I saw a look of terror in its eyes. Then I fired, with a little jerk of the wrist sending the ball a good yard above her head.|$|E
60|$|With a growl Buell {{mounted the}} ladder. When his great shock head hove in sight I {{was seized by}} a mad desire {{to give him a}} little of his own medicine. With both hands <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> piece of pine branch and brought it down with every ounce of {{strength}} in me.|$|E
60|$|I {{promised him}} {{faithfully}} that I would not. Then {{we went through}} a very grim little pantomime. Proceeding to the centre of the arena-like space, <b>I</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>the</b> gun, and appeared to dash out Hans' brains with its butt. He fell upon his back, kicked about a little, and lay still. This finished Act 1.|$|E
40|$|We derive a {{realistic}} spin-orbital model at finite Hund's exchange for alkali hyperoxides. We find that, {{due to the}} geometric frustration of the oxygen lattice, spin and orbital waves destabilize both spin and p-orbital order in almost all potential ground states. We show that the orbital order induced by the lattice overrules the one favoured by superexchange and that this, together with the large interorbital hopping, leads to generalized Goodenough-Kanamori rules. They (<b>i)</b> <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> geometric frustration of the lattice, and (ii) explain the observed layered C-type antiferromagnetic order in alkali hyperoxides. This is confirmed by a spin-wave dispersion with no soft-mode behavior presented here as a prediction for future experiments. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures; accepted in EP...|$|R
60|$|ROBERTS. [Without {{raising his}} voice.] If I saw Mr. Anthony going to die, and I could save him by <b>lifting</b> my hand, <b>I</b> would not <b>lift</b> <b>the</b> little finger of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then," [...] said Jonas, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>lift</b> up <b>the</b> {{upper side}} of the bellows by the handle, to blow, the air comes in by the hole. <b>The</b> clapper <b>lifts</b> up a little way, and lets it in. Then, when I press down the handle again, it presses the air out through the nose, because it can't go back through the valve hole." ...|$|R
