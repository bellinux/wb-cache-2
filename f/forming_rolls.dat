In this thesis, the process of cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is introduced and it is seen that <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design {{is central to the}} cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. The conventional design and manufacture of <b>form</b> <b>rolls</b> is discussed and it is observed that surrounding the design process are a number of activities which although peripheral are time consuming and a possible source of error. A CAD/CAM system is described which alleviates many of the problems traditional to <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design. New techniques for the calculation of strip length and controlling the means of forming bends are detailed. The CAD/CAM system's advantages and limitations are discussed and, whilst the system has numerous significant advantages, its principal limitation can be said to be the need to manufacture <b>form</b> <b>rolls</b> and test them on a mill before a design can be stated satisfactory. A survey of the previous theoretical and experimental analysis of cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is presented and is found to be limited. By considering the previous work, a method of numerical analysis of the cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process is proposed based on a minimum energy approach. Parallel to the numerical analysis, a comprehensive range of software has been developed to enhance the designer's visualisation of the effects of his <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design. A complementary approach to the analysis of <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design is the generation of <b>form</b> <b>roll</b> design, a method for the partial generation of designs is described. It is suggested that the two approaches should continue in parallel and that the limitation of each approach is knowledge of the cold <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. Hence, an initial experimental investigation of the rolling of channel sections is described. Finally, areas of potential future work are discussed...|$|R

40|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> of ultra-high {{strength}} steels (UHSS) {{and other}} high strength alloys is an advanced manufacturing methodology {{with the ability}} of cold forming those materials to complex three-dimensional shapes for lightweight structural applications. Due to their high strength, most of these materials have a reduced ductility which excludes conventional sheet forming methods under cold <b>forming</b> conditions. <b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> is possible due to its low strains and incremental forming characteristic. Recent research investigates the development of high strength nano-structured aluminum sheet and titanium alloys, {{as well as their}} behaviour in <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> with regard to formability, material behaviour and shape defects. The development of new materials is often limited to small scale samples due to the high preparation costs.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} half century roll forming has become a highly {{productive}} metal forming technology, well-established in the industry for the manufacturing of mass products. About 8 % of the annual world production of steel is processed by roll forming mills. Roll forming technology enables the manufacturing of profile-shaped products with an extremely wide spectrum of geometrical shapes. In lightweight construction, the utilization of roll-formed structures of high and ultra-high-strength steels has increased remarkably in the recent years. However, the application of those types of steel entails some disadvantages resulting in a decreasing forming capacity and enormous efforts to reach the required dimensional accuracy. Until a profile leaves the roll forming machine with the target quality, it is mostly necessary to align the <b>forming</b> <b>rolls</b> several times. Sometimes even design changes are required. This is the result of unreliable process planning. Furthermore, typical profile failures such as twist, flare and spring-back occur even stronger compared to mild steels. Nowadays, it is usual to control the dimensional accuracy of the profiles after the last forming stand. This kind of quality control has the following disadvantage: manufacturing errors are detected very late. Therefore, a continuous quality control process and an active manipulation during the forming process promise a large potential for an improvement of the dimensional accuracy and an increase of roll forming productivity...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{roll forming}} {{is limited to}} {{components}} with uniform cross-section; the recently developed flexible roll forming (FRF) process {{can be used to}} form components which vary in both width and depth. It has been suggested that this process can be used to manufacture automotive components from Ultra High Strength Steel (UHSS) which has limited tensile elongation and is unsuitable for stamping. In the flexible roll forming process, the pre-cut blank is fed through a set of rolls; some rolls are computer-numerically controlled (CNC) to follow the 3 D contours of the part and hence parts with a variable cross-section can be produced. As with conventional roll forming, the number of forming stations is kept to a minimum, particularly the controlled roll stations, in order to limit tooling costs. This paper introduces a new flexible roll forming technique which can be used to form a complex shape with the minimum tooling requirements. In this method, the pre-cut blank is held between two dies and the whole system moves back and forth past CNC <b>forming</b> <b>rolls.</b> The forming roll changes its angle and position in each pass to incrementally form the part. In this work, the process is simulated using the commercial software package Copra FEA.

Different tooling concepts are used to improve the strain distribution and hence the part quality.

40|$|The {{dimpling}} {{process is}} a novel cold-roll forming process that involves dimpling of a rolled flat strip prior to the roll forming operation. This is a process undertaken to enhance the material properties and subsequent products’ structural performance while maintaining a minimum strip thickness. In {{order to understand the}} complex and interrelated nonlinear changes in contact, geometry and material properties that occur in the process, it is necessary to accurately simulate the process and validate through physical tests. In this paper, 3 D non-linear finite element analysis was employed to simulate the dimpling process and mechanical testing of the subsequent dimpled sheets, in which the dimple geometry and material properties data were directly transferred from the dimpling process. Physical measurements, tensile and bending tests on dimpled sheet steel were conducted to evaluate the simulation results. Simulation of the dimpling process identified the amount of non-uniform plastic strain introduced {{and the manner in which}} this was distributed through the sheet. The plastic strain resulted in strain hardening which could correlate to the increase in the strength of the dimpled steel when compared to plain steel originating from the same coil material. A parametric study revealed that the amount of plastic strain depends upon on the process parameters such as friction and overlapping gap between the two <b>forming</b> <b>rolls.</b> The results derived from simulations of the tensile and bending tests were in good agreement with the experimental ones. The validation indicates that the finite element analysis was able to successfully simulate the dimpling process and mechanical properties of the subsequent dimpled steel products...|$|E

With this method during forming process, chip forming such as hobbing and broaching method is not involved. The manufacturing process is as follows; the tube which the sheet is formed and welded to by roll forming machine, is mounted on a suitable mandrel. This mandrel has an external toothing which corresponds to internal toothing of the final product. During axial moving and rotating of the workpiece, forming operation is carried out in lengthwise direction of the toothing. This <b>forming</b> <b>rolls</b> is positioned on the roll head and have a rolling axis vertical with the one of a mandrel.

The present work {{deals with}} a new method, {{technology}} and equipment developed for “in depth surface hardening ” of large rotary details and tools, made of constructional, carbon, alloyed or low-alloyed tool steels. According to the technical requirements the details and tools have to possess hardened layer with specific shape, depth in the range 20 - 35 mm and surface hardness of 35 - 62 HRC. The “in-depth hardening ” was performed by quenching and self-tempering. Preliminary volume heating and depth regulated local surface adjustable gas-flame heating were used. The gas-flame heating was realized by gas-flame burners (CH 4 +O 2) located near the details ’ periphery, depending on the shape and depth of the hardened layer.

40|$|The {{conventional}} design of <b>forming</b> <b>rolls</b> depends {{heavily on the}} individual skill of roll designers {{which is based on}} intuition and knowledge gained from previous work. Roll design is normally a trial an error procedure, however with the progress of computer technology, CAD/CAM systems for the cold roll-forming industry have been developed. Generally, however, these CAD systems can only provide a flower pattern based on the knowledge obtained from previously successful flower patterns. In the production of ERW (Electric Resistance Welded) tube and pipe, the need for a theoretical simulation of the roll-forming process, which can not only predict the occurrence of the edge buckling but also obtain the optimum forming condition, has been recognised. A new simulation system named "CADFORM" has been devised that can carry out the consistent forming simulation for this tube-making process. The CADFORM system applied an elastic-plastic stress-strain analysis and evaluate edge buckling by using a simplified model of the forming process. The results can also be visualised graphically. The calculated longitudinal strain is obtained by considering the deformation of lateral elements and takes into account the reduction in strains due to the fin-pass roll. These calculated strains correspond quite well with the experimental results. Using the calculated strains, the stresses in the strip can be estimated. The addition of the fin-pass roll reduction significantly reduces the longitudinal compressive stress and therefore effectively suppresses edge buckling. If the calculated longitudinal stress is controlled, by altering the forming flower pattern so it does not exceed the buckling stress within the material, then the occurrence of edge buckling can be avoided. CADFORM predicts the occurrence of edge buckling of the strip in tube-making and uses this information to suggest an appropriate flower pattern and forming conditions which will suppress the occurrence of the edge buckling...|$|E

40|$|Summary. To {{study the}} {{structure}} of metals and alloys and its influence on their properties are widely used traditional methods of macro- and microanalysis, X-ray, spectral, thermal and inspection (X-ray, magnetic, ultrasonic). They have their own threshold, often narrowly focused and applied directly depending on {{the purpose of the}} research object (pipe, <b>forming</b> <b>rolls,</b> metal, etc.). Currently existing mathematical models of forecasting the qualitative characteristics of metal products based only on an analysis of statistical data do not provide physical-chemical interpretation of the processes that occur during the formation of the structure or who could definitely take into account the effect of the chemical composition and other parameters of the technology. Therefore, the forecast results can not always meet the requirements. In order to obtain acceptable quality results produced by the product specifications developed by the forecast methodology should include the use of both classical and modern methods of structure evaluation. So, to determine the relationship between mechanical properties and structure elements of cast iron roll is planned to use the theory of fractals and multifractal. The proposed method is the most appropriate to quantify the majority of real structures, which the integer approximation of the figures of Euclid introduces some uncertainty, and therefore not always acceptable in practical problems of modern materials. In this regard, it is assumed conducting special experiments, the analysis of which allows to develop a qualitative evaluation of the mechanical properties of the investigated steels and cast iron.

40|$|With the {{steadily}} {{increase in}} demand for roll formed products due to their application for fields such as automotive, construction, architecture, etc., roll forming companies are challenge with rising customer demands. Companies are struggling to bring a product through from design to manufacture at improved rates, whilst achieving tighter tolerances. The roll forming process may also induce undesirable forming defects such as twist, distortion and straightness problems. Traditionally these issues would be resolved through an empirical approach which heavily relies on the designer's expertise and intuition. This approach can increase undesired development costs due to materials wasted and time delayed. Over the years, numerical simulations have been deployed to try and geometrically validate these defects and ultimately reduce the development phase of a product. The designer has the capability to virtually investigate changes in specific parameters without the risk of expensive tooling costs. The industry partner of this project, Hadley Group, Birmingham, implement Belleville washers into the roll tool configuration. The purpose of these washers is to apply pressure to the strip during roll forming in order to drive material through each forming station. They are also used to adjust {{the gap between the}} top and bottom <b>forming</b> <b>rolls,</b> since the incoming material gauge can vary by the nominal tolerance values from coil to coil. For the purpose of this paper, an investigation is carried out focusing on an individual parameter within the finite element analysis (FEA) of the cold roll forming process, i. e. the 'unknown' spring acting on the top roll during the forming process due to the implementation of Belleville washers in the pillar set up. The work explained in this paper shows the eects of the pressure applied to the forming process on the geometric attributes of the section being formed. The outcome will determine the viability of this parameter, which may ultimately require the numerical design methodology of roll formed products to be amended accordingly...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, a simple model {{was developed to}} extend {{the application of the}} traditional flower pattern diagram as a design tool for roll forming. The position of a point on the strip as it passes through each set of rolls can be identified as a series of points in the two-dimensional flower pattern diagram. In three dimensions, these points will lie on a non-circular cylindrical surface having its axis parallel to the machine axis. Assuming that these points are joined by a smooth curve, the forming path of a point on the strip as it passes through the roll forming process can be obtained as a plane curve on the plane development of this surface. It was shown in previous work that the longitudinal membrane strain and, in certain cases, local curvature of the sheet are functions of the slope of this plane curve. In this work, the strains on both surfaces {{at the edge of a}} strip in the forming of a simple V-channel are measured using strain gauges. It is shown that near the point of contact with the rolls, the strains differ by nearly an order of magnitude from those determined from the simple model which assumes that the trajectory is a smooth curve. A modification of the forming path is obtained from the measured bending strains. Although the changes in displacement are small, the peak values of strain near the point of roll contact are large and a consequence of highly localised changes in the forming path as the strip passes over each roll. Measurement of this perturbation in the forming path is difficult as the region is obscured by the <b>forming</b> <b>rolls.</b> The technique described here permits the reconstruction of this path and identifies a new area of investigation of longitudinal strains in roll forming. These are often associated with shape defects such as bow, warping and end flare...|$|E
