(the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While <b>discourse</b> markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project {{falls under the}} broader Apartheid Archives Project. The aim {{of the project was}} to collect the narratives of black and white South Africans, of their earliest quotidian or everyday racist experiences. This project focused particularly {{on the nature of the}} experiences of racism of (particularly ‘ordinary’) white South Africans under the old apartheid order and their continuing effects on individual and group functioning in contemporary South Africa, especially on the ways in which white South Africans are positioned by racialised <b>discourses</b> and the reproduction of power relations through these positions. The project utilised narratives that were written by white South Africans and were available on the Apartheid Archive Project’s database. In total, the narratives of twelve white, middle-aged, middle class South Africans were analysed using Parker (1992) and Willig’s (2008) guidelines for analysis of the <b>discourses</b> which converge with Foucault’s ideas. This research report gives prominence to the <b>discourses</b> of race present in the narratives of white South Africans which were examined and it also focuses on how racialised <b>discourses</b> offer the narrators different subject positions to occupy in present day South Africa. Three discursive themes were identified, namely rationalising discursive strategies, race and racism <b>discourses</b> and <b>discourses</b> of redemption. Rationalising discursive strategies were found to utilise <b>discourses</b> of innocence, <b>discourses</b> of denial and <b>discourses</b> that avoid complicity. These <b>discourses</b> enabled the narrators to be positioned as victims. Race and racism <b>discourses</b> included othering <b>discourses,</b> <b>discourses</b> of whiteness and <b>discourses</b> of interracial relationships. Through an appeal to these kinds of <b>discourses</b> narrators were able to occupy opposing positions, such as perpetrator, hero, privileged and non-racial. Finally, <b>discourses</b> of redemption were also found to be prominent in the narratives. These comprised of religious <b>discourses</b> and notions of white liberalism. The utilisation of such <b>discourses</b> enabled constructions of the narrators as moral, virtuous and honest...|$|R

40|$|Politics are {{not only}} about {{interests}} and institutions but <b>discourses</b> as well. <b>Discourses</b> are (dominant) ideas, concepts and categorisations {{in a society that}} give meaning to reality and that shape the identities, interests and preferences of individuals and groups. The assumption of this chapter is that forest <b>discourses</b> are constitutive to global forest politics. Three forest-related types of <b>discourses</b> are distinguished: meta <b>discourses</b> that relate to global economics, politics and culture; regulatory <b>discourses</b> that deal with the regulation and instrumentation of policy issues; and forest <b>discourses</b> that shape forest issues and policies in specific ways. On the basis of a scientific literature review, the main <b>discourses</b> within these three categories (meta, regulatory and forest <b>discourses)</b> as well as three regional forest <b>discourses</b> (Africa, Asia and Latin-America) are analysed. This analysis leads to a number of policy messages: (1) policy makers should try to understand and embrace discursive complexity (instead of artificially reducing it); (2) awareness of this discursive complexity improves global forest negotiations; (3) orchestrated collective action might lead to discursive change; and (4) {{there is a need for}} new, open, discursive arenas to improve global forest policymaking...|$|R

40|$|A {{considerable}} body {{of knowledge}} has been constructed perpetuating the notion single parenthood is a significant problem for society, and while this is supported by specific research designs and sampling practices, it is also maintained by two key <b>discourses.</b> The first constitutes single parenthood as a deficit, while the second identifies it as a risk. In both cases, these <b>discourses</b> are operationalised by the philosophy of neo-liberalism, which envisions good citizenship as economic autonomy. Historically, {{it has been the}} convergence of the risk and deficit <b>discourses</b> that has constituted single parenthood as a social problem. More recently, however, risk <b>discourses</b> have come to dominate thinking about single parenthood. As a result, this thesis terms risk <b>discourses</b> as dominant <b>discourses.</b> As dominant <b>discourses,</b> risk sidelines or discounts other ways of thinking about single parenthood. While a few exceptions are notable, including some feminist, poststructural and family resilience scholars, most researchers appear unable to see past the positioning of these <b>discourses</b> and envision another way of being for parents who are single. This means that alternative subjectivities are obscured and have limited influence in this field of research. Because this thesis aimed to problematise dominant subjectivities of single parenthood, a poststructural Foucauldian framework has been utilized in order to document the discursive constructions of single parenthood through literature, insider <b>discourses,</b> and outsider <b>discourses.</b> For the purposes of this thesis, outsider <b>discourses</b> are constituted as those outside the subjectivities of single parenthood, such as media and research <b>discourses.</b> An examination of the Australian media has been undertaken over a one year period, the results of which form the basis for the analysis of media <b>discourses</b> of single parenthood. Parents who are single were also targeted for self selection into this project to provide insider <b>discourses</b> about single parenthood. This analysis explored how respondents negotiated the <b>discourses</b> of single parenthood and how they themselves used or rejected the subjectivities constructed for them via these <b>discourses</b> to constitute their own subjectivities. This thesis aimed to explore the role of <b>discourses</b> in the construction of individuals' subjectivities. Specifically, it draws attention {{to the way in which}} knowledge and power work through <b>discourses</b> to emphasize what is allowable, both publicly and privately, in relation to single parenthood. Most importantly, this thesis offers alternative subjectivities for single parenthood to facilitate new ways of thinking about parents who are single...|$|R

25|$|In every <b>discourse,</b> {{whether of}} the mind conversing with its own thoughts, or of the {{individual}} in his intercourse with others, there is an assumed or expressed limit within which the subjects of its operation are confined.
