50|$|Verdeschi {{introduces}} Maya to Guido and {{the brothers}} {{engage in a}} game of verbal one-upmanship. Englishman Bartlett swells with pride when he hears the transluminal drive was developed by researchers at Cambridge—but is disappointed when Hunter the American smugly reveals it was Cambridge, Massachusetts. A development of the <b>ion</b> <b>rocket,</b> it can make loops in the space-time continuum; travel time back to Earth, subjectively, is a matter of hours. Guido tells them the Superswift is the advance party; Earth will dispatch proper transport ships to evacuate Moonbase Alpha. At this, Maya withdraws, insecure with the thought of becoming an outsider among Earth's billions.|$|E
5000|$|Another popular {{confinement}} {{concept for}} fusion rockets is inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC), {{such as in}} the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor or the Polywell variation being researched by the Energy-Matter Conversion Corporation. The University of Illinois has defined a 500-tonne [...] "Fusion Ship II" [...] concept capable of delivering a 100,000 kg manned payload to Jupiter's moon Europa in 210 days. Fusion Ship II utilizes <b>ion</b> <b>rocket</b> thrusters (343 km/s exhaust velocity) powered by ten D-He3 IEC fusion reactors. The concept would need 300 tonnes of argon propellant for a 1-year round trip to the Jupiter system. Dr. Robert Bussard published a series of technical articles discussing its application to spaceflight throughout the 1990s. His work was popularised by an article in the Analog Science Fiction and Fact publication, where Tom Ligon (who has also written several science fiction stories) described how the fusor would make for a highly effective fusion rocket. It was also featured in this role in the science fiction novel The Wreck of the River of Stars, by Michael Flynn.|$|E

40|$|Arcing {{between the}} {{electrodes}} of an <b>ion</b> <b>rocket</b> thrustor is investigated {{for the effect}} it {{will have on the}} overall design of <b>ion</b> <b>rocket</b> systems. The effect of generator, transformer, and inserted impedances on system stability and efficiency, and on operating lifetime of thrustor components are considered. Rate of arcing, preferential arc paths, speed of arc interruption, and response of thrustors to voltage transients are also discussed. The study indicates that arcing is a system hazard and that arcing rates are of prime importance in the design and development of thrustors, thrustor arrays, and system components. Two system models for reducing the hazard are proposed, based on principles developed herein, published data, and experience available from operation of nine-module electron-bombardment thrustor array. Experimental investigation of these models is presently underway...|$|E
40|$|Payloads {{and mission}} times were {{calculated}} for space vehicles propelled by ion rockets using nuclear power supplies having specific weights from 10 t o 50 lb/kw. Included {{in the study were}} five missions: low-altitude lunar satellite, low-altitude Venus satellite, solar probe, Saturn probe, and a Jupiter satellite with a circular orbit at the altitude of Jupiter's fourth moon. The variation of payload with the ration of power supply weight to gross weight was studied and the optimum power levels thereby determined. The <b>ion</b> <b>rocket</b> payload capabilities were compared with those of high-thrust vehicles using hydrogen-oxygen rockets and tungsten-core nuclear rockets; in addition the performance of high- and low-thrust systems staged in combination has been investigated. Launch vehicles considered in this study were the Atlas-Centaur, the Saturn C- 1, and the Saturn C- 5...|$|E
40|$|Neutralization of the {{ion beam}} {{produced}} by a FEEP thruster is in principle a task similar to the well-known problem of neutralizing a traditional <b>ion</b> <b>rocket.</b> On the other hand, the neutralization of a small, micronewton thrust level FEEP poses several practical problems. The neutralizer has to produce a very low electron current, that must couple with the very fast ions exhausted by the thruster. As the envisaged use of FEEP is based on its fine throttling capabilities, the neutralizer has to be proportionately able to follow the variations of the ion current, with the same rapidity. A first experimental assessment of {{the problem has been}} recently performed at Centrospazio. A series of test has been carried out on a 3 cm emitter, together with two neutralizers, namely a plasma bridge hollow cathode and a hot filament. The hollow cathode, developed by SEP, was fed by gaseous cæsium. A thoriated tungsten filament was also tested. The thruster and neutralizer operational parameters have been recorded, including the coupling potential between the neutralizer and the ion beam. In order to measure this potential, the thruster assembly was electrically isolated from the vacuum facility and kept floating during the tests. This paper presents the experimental setup and the test results. A critical analysis of the data gathered is provided, aimed at the identification of the optimal technology for a flight model...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Perchlorate <b>ions</b> from <b>rocket</b> fuel, flare and munitions {{manufacture}} and use have escaped into groundwater {{in several states}} in the USA. Perchlorate causes alarm because it mimics iodine physiologically and is adsorbed by the thyroid gland, subsequently interfering with the endocrine systems of the brain. Removal of perchlorate to very low ppb is difficult on two fronts: competing ions such as nitrate, sulfate, carbonate etc. are often present at 1000 times higher concentration than perchlorate, and perchlorate is surprisingly stable considering its reputation as a rocket fuel oxidant. Direct electrochemical reduction of perchlorate in the parts per billion range is too slow and expensive to be viable. Ion exchange produces a troublesome disposal problem: either a perchlorate laden ion exchange resin or a brine stream containing high concentrations of perchlorate, nitrate, sulfate and bicarbonate. Electrochemical redox reduction of perchlorate, coupled to io...|$|R
40|$|The {{superior}} {{energy density}} of antimatter annihilation {{has often been}} pointed to as the ultimate source of energy for propulsion. In our day to day life cost of fuel is being improved. So for launching satellite we need {{to spend more money}} for that, to avoid that we just planned to introduce advanced antimatter propulsion rockets. In propulsion power which is created using collision between electron & positron is used. It is a type of <b>ion</b> propulsion <b>rocket.</b> The important factor is availability of fuel, to avoid that we can use this type of rockets. Power produced by this propulsion is very higher than that the any other type of propulsion. In this paper Production and trapping of antiprotons for space propulsion applications are reviewed. Present and foreseeable production rates at Fermi lab are discussed, and experiments on trapping, confinement and transport of large quantities of antiprotons, as well as synthesis of atomic anti-hydrogen, are outlined. Unfortunately, the limited capacity and very low efficiency of present-day antiproton production methods suggest that antimatter may be too costly to consider for near-term propulsion applications...|$|R
50|$|Ion {{thrusters}} use {{beams of}} ions (electrically charged atoms or molecules) to create thrust {{in accordance with}} momentum conservation. The method of accelerating the ions varies, but all designs {{take advantage of the}} charge/mass ratio of the ions. This ratio means that relatively small potential differences can create high exhaust velocities. This reduces the amount of reaction mass or propellant required, but increases the amount of specific power required compared to chemical <b>rockets.</b> <b>Ion</b> thrusters are therefore able to achieve high specific impulses. The drawback of the low thrust is low acceleration because the mass of the electric power unit directly correlates with the amount of power. This low thrust makes ion thrusters unsuited for launching spacecraft into orbit, but effective for in-space propulsion.|$|R
40|$|Whipped cream {{stays in}} place even when turned upside down. Yet it readily {{flows through the}} nozzle of a spray can to reach the dessert plate. This {{demonstrates}} the phenomenon of shear thinning {{that is important to}} many industrial and physical processes. Paints, film emulsions, and other complex solutions that are highly viscous under normal conditions but become thin and flow easily under shear forces. A simple fluid, such as water, does not exhibit shear thinning under normal conditions. Very close to the liquid-vapor critical point, where the distinction between liquid and vapor disappears, the fluid becomes more complex and is predicted to display shear thinning. At the critical point, xenon atoms interact over long distances in a classical model of cooperative phenomena. Physicists rely on this system to learn how long-range order arises. The Critical Viscosity of Xenon Experiment (CVX- 2) will measure the viscous behavior of xenon, a heavy inert gas used in flash lamps and <b>ion</b> <b>rocket</b> engines, at its critical point. Although it does not easily combine with other chemicals, its viscosity at the critical point {{can be used as a}} model for a range of fluids. Viscosity originates from the interactions of individual molecules. It is so complicated that, except for the simplest gas, it cannot be calculated accurately from theory. Tests with critical fluids can provide key data, but are limited on Earth because critical fluids are highly compressed by gravity. CVX- 2 employs a tiny metal screen vibrating between two electrodes in a bath of critical xenon. The vibrations and how they dampen are used to measure viscosity. CVX flew on STS- 85 (1997), where it revealed that, close to the critical point, the xenon is partly elastic: it can 'stretch' as well as flow. For STS- 107, the hardware has been enhanced to determine if critical xenon is a shear-thinning fluid...|$|E
40|$|The {{developing}} technology of laser power beaming is introduced, and two systems {{are used as}} examples of {{the capabilities of the}} laser for beamed energy. In the first system, the potential of the laser to power flight systems ranging from hypersonic air-breathing launch vehicles to commercial jet transports is examined. Attention is given to the possibility of an air-breathing propulsion which offers the promise of a global air transportation network independent of kerosene and powered by solar energy. In addition, consideration is given to a new type of rocket propulsion based on the laser's ability to concentrate coherent laser energy to high power densities. Focused laser beams would heat the propellants directly to produce specific impulses approaching <b>ion</b> and MHD <b>rocket</b> levels, and would do so without the burden of a heavy electrical power supply...|$|R
40|$|Data from ARCS <b>rocket</b> <b>ion</b> beam {{injection}} {{experiments are}} primarily discussed. There are three {{results from this}} series of active experiments that are of particular interest in space plasma physics. These are the transverse acceleration of ambient ions in the large beam volume, the scattering of beam ions near the release payload, and the possible acceleration of electrons {{very close to the}} plasma generator which produce intense high frequency waves. The ability of 100 ma ion beam injections into the upper E and F regions of the ionosphere to produce these phenomena appear to be related solely to the process by which the plasma release payload and the ion beam are neutralized. Since the electrons in the plasma release do not convect with the plasma ions, the neutralization of both the payload and beam must be accomplished by large field-aligned currents (milliamperes/square meter) which are very unstable to wave growth of various modes...|$|R
40|$|Transverse ion {{acceleration}} {{has been}} observed at rocket altitudes between 500 and 1000 km due to (1) the injection of 100 - 200 eV argon plasma; (2) auroral electron precipitation; and (3) the injection of electromagnetic waves. Field-aligned currents necessary to neutralize the plasma injection payloads and naturally occurring in the aurora could {{be responsible for the}} ions observed in (1) and (2) above. Associated with the aurora, both bulk heating and tail heating are observed, sometimes simultaneously. In this case, either different masses are accelerated or different mechanisms are responsible. The bulk heating is closely correlated with the aurora structure while tail heating is not so well correlated. Recent high-time-resolution <b>rocket</b> <b>ion</b> data have revealed that the transverse acceleration process is of very short duration (about 100 ms) and occurs in a very limited volume (a few hundred kilometers along B and on the order of the ion gyrodiameter across B). Such impulse acceleration events are correlated with waves near the lower hybrid resonance...|$|R

Perchlorate causes alarm because it mimics iodine physiologically and is adsorbed by the thyroid gland, subsequently interfering with the endocrine systems of the brain. Removal of perchlorate to very low ppb is difficult on two fronts: competing ions such as nitrate, sulfate, carbonate etc. are often present at 1000 times higher concentration than perchlorate, and perchlorate is surprisingly stable considering its reputation as a rocket fuel oxidant. Direct electrochemical reduction of perchlorate in the parts per billion range is too slow and expensive to be viable. Ion exchange produces a troublesome disposal problem: either a perchlorate laden ion exchange resin or a brine stream containing high concentrations of perchlorate, nitrate, sulfate and bicarbonate. Electrochemical redox reduction of perchlorate, coupled to ion exchange capture and concentration is an economic and elegant method of dealing with both nitrate and perchlorate, particularly if the kinetics of the reduction process are fast. Perchlorate is surprisingly stable to reduction at a reducing cathode and with common reducing redox ions such as Cr 2 +, Fe 2 +. The reaction of perchlorate with Ti 3 + is well documented in the literature, but the kinetics are slow in common solutions. In our latest study we have discovered that the reaction of perchlorate with titanium ions in methanesulfonic acid is very fast. We describe the laboratory experiments and pilot plant field trials in California that demonstrate the utility of this method for removing perchlorate and nitrate directly from drinking water and from regenerant brines from ion exchange systems...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} propel a manned space craft from earth orbit to Mars various {{propulsion}} systems are considered. Propulsion systems which {{are discussed in}} connection with manned Mars flight are: chemical rockets, nuclear thermal <b>rockets,</b> <b>ion</b> engines, thermal arc jet thrusters, magnetoplasmadynamic (MPD) thrusters. High power thermal arc jet thrusters and continuously running self-field MPD thrusters offer the capability of being operated at different power levels. This results in variable specific impulse that mainly depends on propellant mass flow rate and electrical power. For each thruster design the attainable specific impulse is limited by a maximum arc current, which can be supplied to this thruster. Therefore, this paper deals with a new thermal plasma thruster which uses two different mechanisms to couple energy into the propellant. ATTILA [8] combines the advantages of thermal arc jets and self-field MPD thrusters, especially their relatively simple setup, and the reliability of a radio frequency power supply, which is usually used for surface hardening. This paper describes the setup of ATTILA and shows its utility as propulsion system. Additionally, numerical calculations to optimize future thruster configurations will be presented...|$|R

These services include test planning and early assessment of Space projects, management and/or technical support required to safely and effectively prepare the article and facility for testing, operation of test facilities, and validation/delivery {{of data to}} customer. The Space Electronic Test Engineering Branch is assigned electronic test engineering responsibility for the GRC Space Simulation, Microgravity, Cryogenic, and Combustion Test Facilities. While working with the Space Power and Propulsion Test Engineering Branch I am working on several different assignments. My primary assignment deals with an electrical hardware unit known as Sunny Boy. Sunny Boy is a DC load Bank that is designed for solar arrays {{in which it is}} used to convert DC power form the solar arrays into AC power at 60 hertz to pump back into the electricity grid. However, there are some researchers who decided {{that they would like to}} use the Sunny Boy unit in a space simulation as a DC load bank for a space shuttle or even the International Space Station hardware. In order to do so I must create a communication link between a computer and the Sunny Boy unit so that I can preset a few of the limits (such power, set & constant voltage levels) that Sunny Boy will need to operate using the applied DC load. Apart from this assignment I am also working on a hi-tech circuit that I need to have built at a researcher s request. This is a high voltage analog to digital circuit that will be used to record data from space <b>ion</b> propulsion <b>rocket</b> booster tests. The problem that makes building this circuit so difficult is that it contains high voltage we must find a way to lower the voltage signal before the data is transferred into the computer to be read. The solution to this problem was to transport the signal using infrared light which will lower the voltage signal down low enough so that it is harmless to a computer. Along with my involvement in the Space Power and Propulsion Test Engineering Branch, I am obligated to assist all other members of the branch in their work. This will help me to strengthen and extend my knowledge of Electrical Engineering...|$|R
40|$|The ECOMA (Existence and Charge state Of Meteoric dust grains in {{the middle}} Atmosphere) series of {{sounding}} rocket flights consisted of nine flights with almost identical payload design and flight characteristics. All flights carried a radio wave propagation experiment together {{with a variety of}} plasma probes. Three of these measured electron densities, two <b>ion</b> densities. The <b>rockets</b> were all launched from the Andøya Rocket Range, Norway, in four campaigns between 2006 and 2010. Emphasis is on the final three flights from 2010 where the payloads were equipped with four instruments capable of measuring plasma densities in situ, among them a novel probe flown {{for the first time in}} conjunction with a wave propagation experiment. Deviation factors of all probe data relative to the wave propagation results were derived and revealed that none of the probe data were close to the wave propagation results at all heights, but – more importantly – the instruments showed very different behaviour at different altitudes. The novel multi-needle Langmuir probe exhibits the best correlation to the wave propagation data, as there is minimal influence of the payload potential, but it is still subject to aerodynamics, especially at its location at the rear of the payload. For all other probe types, the deviation factor comes closer to unity with increasing plasma density. No systematic difference of the empirical deviation factor between day and night can be found. The large negative payload potential in the last three flights may be the cause for discrepancies between electron and ion probe data below 85 km...|$|R
