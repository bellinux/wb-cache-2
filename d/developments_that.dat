In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any substantial amount of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E
5|$|In summary, Luang Pu Sodh had a {{significant}} impact on Thai Buddhism, both in Thailand and abroad. He helped pioneer the combination of study and meditation, traditionally two separate monastic vocations. Newell points out that in this he even preceded Phra Phimontham, the administrator monk who introduced the New Burmese (meditation) Method in Thailand. Luang Pu Sodh ordained a British monk that helped pioneer Buddhism in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, he started many <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> were continued by Wat Phra Dhammakaya, later to become the largest temple of Thailand.|$|E

5|$|In the end, the Alsos Mission contributed {{little to}} the Allied defeat of Nazi Germany, because the German nuclear and {{biological}} weapons programs {{that it had been}} formed to investigate turned out to be smaller and less threatening than had been feared. In the field of nuclear weapons development at least, the underfunded and disorganized German program lagged far behind the Allies' own efforts. In its appropriation of the accomplishments of European science, the Alsos Mission played a small part in the wartime and subsequent scientific and technological <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> characterized and transformed the postwar world.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the area}} is now Green Belt, placing {{restrictions}} on the kinds of <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> can take place. There are areas of commercial peat extraction, but Salford City Council is seeking to return at least some back to wet mossland. Planning permission for peat extraction expired {{at the end of}} 2010. At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal by the companies involved. A public inquiry concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.|$|E

Whitman concluded that they were partly inspired by scientists Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y. Tsien and their work on research on isolating genes from jellyfish for the treatment of Huntington's disease; all three won the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.|$|E

Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide. The Mesoamerican area {{gave rise to a}} series of cultural <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> included complex societies, agriculture, cities, monumental architecture, writing, and calendrical systems. The set of traits shared by Mesoamerican cultures also included astronomical knowledge, blood and human sacrifice, and a cosmovision that viewed the world as divided into four divisions aligned with the cardinal directions, each with different attributes, and a three-way division of the world into the celestial realm, the earth, and the underworld.|$|E
5|$|Early work in {{molecular}} genetics suggested {{the concept that}} one gene makes one protein. This concept (originally called the one gene-one enzyme hypothesis) emerged from an influential 1941 paper by George Beadle and Edward Tatum on experiments with mutants of the fungus Neurospora crassa. Norman Horowitz, an early colleague on the Neurospora research, reminisced in 2004 that “these experiments founded the science of what Beadle and Tatum called biochemical genetics. In actuality they {{proved to be the}} opening gun in what became {{molecular genetics}} and all the <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> have followed from that.” The one gene-one protein concept has been refined since the discovery of genes that can encode multiple proteins by alternative splicing and coding sequences split in short section across the genome whose mRNAs are concatenated by trans-splicing.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Congress passed must-carry regulations, which {{required}} cable carriers to allocate spectrum to local broadcasters. This affected {{the availability of}} C-SPAN in some areas, in particular C-SPAN2, as some providers chose to discontinue carriage of the channel altogether. Between 1993 and 1994, cable systems in 95 U.S. cities dropped or reduced broadcasts of C-SPAN and C-SPAN2, following {{the implementation of the}} must-carry regulations. Viewers protested these decisions, especially when the changes coincided with matters of local interest occurring in the House or Senate. Some communities, such as Eugene, Oregon and Alexandria, Virginia, were successful in restoring C-SPAN availability. C-SPAN availability was later restored as technological <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> resulted in the expansion of channel capacity on cable providers allowed for mandatory stations and the C-SPAN networks both to be broadcast.|$|E

His systems management experience served him well in his new post. In the coming years, any change {{to the design of}} the Apollo spacecraft would have to receive its final approval from Joe Shea. He kept control of the program using a management tool that he devised for himself—a looseleaf notebook, more than a hundred pages in length, that would be put together for him every week summarizing all of the important <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> had taken place and decisions that needed to be made. Presented with the notebook on Thursday evenings, Shea would study and annotate it over the weekend and return to work with new questions, instructions, and decisions. This idiosyncratic tool allowed him to keep tabs on a complex and ever-expanding program.|$|E
5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} a bevy of <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason. The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where the}} Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of the neighborhoods varies significantly {{from one to another}} and includes everything from large skyscrapers to houses from the late 19th century to modern, suburban-style developments. Generally, the neighborhoods closest to the city center are denser, older and contain more brick building material.

Some of the neighborhoods even farther from the city center, or recently redeveloped parcels anywhere in the city, have either very suburban characteristics or are new urbanist <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> attempt to recreate the feel of older neighborhoods.

City officials hoped to create a magnet for artists and aficionados in the downtown area with the center and other <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> include a renovated Venetian Theatre. The goal was to have the center encourage art studios to open and for art related festivals to develop to attract people to downtown after most businesses closed. Traditionally, shops and businesses closed by 6:00p.m. as workers in the county seat left for the day. The center also is rented out to groups for private functions.|$|E
5|$|Gil met guitarist {{and singer}} Caetano Veloso at the Universidade Federal da Bahia (Federal University of Bahia) in 1963. The two {{immediately}} began collaborating and performing together, releasing a single and EP soon afterwards. Along with Maria Bethânia (Veloso's sister), Gal Costa, and Tom Zé, Gil and Veloso performed bossa nova and traditional Brazilian songs at the Vila Velha Theatre's opening night in July 1964, a show entitled Nós, por Exemplo (Us, for Example). Gil {{and the group}} continued to perform at the venue and he eventually became a musical director of the concert series. Gil collaborated again with members of this collective on the landmark 1968 album , whose style was influenced by The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, an album Gil listened to constantly. Gil describes Tropicália: ou Panis et Circenses as {{the birth of the}} tropicália movement. As Gil describes it, tropicália (or Tropicalismo) was a conflation of musical and cultural <b>developments</b> <b>that</b> had occurred in Brazil during the 1950s and 1960s—primarily bossa nova and the Jovem Guarda (Young Wave) collective—with rock and roll music from the United States and Europe, a movement deemed threatening by the Brazilian government of the time.|$|E
