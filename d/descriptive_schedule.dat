40|$|This study {{assessed}} {{the level of}} adoption of recommended agrochemical practices among crop farmers in Kaduna and Ondo States of Nigeria. It measured the perception of farmers on pesticides and their knowledge on {{the harmful effects of}} pesticides. A total of 260 crop farmers who have sustained the use of agrochemicals {{for at least five years}} were selected for the study using a multi-stage sampling technique. Data were collected using pretested, structured interview <b>schedule.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> statistics (mean and percentages) were used for data analysis. The results obtained revealed that 33. 1 % of the farmers considered pesticides as always favorable (harmless) whereas 30 % of the respondents perceived pesticides as sometimes unfavorable (harmful). All (100 %) the respondents indicated that pesticides cause damage to human health. Furthermore, the level of adoption of recommended agrochemical practices (RAPs) was generally low (weighted mean = 1. 49) despite high level of awareness (weighted mean = 2. 24). This study recommends that campaign for attitudinal changes on the use of agrochemica...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the factors influencing self employment and income among one hundred 100 agribusiness households in Abia State, Nigeria. In analyzing the factors influencing agribusiness household self employment and income, the level and the areas of self employment were also examined. Data for the analysis were collected using structured questionnaire and interview <b>schedule.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> statistics, probit regression and ordinary least square regression were {{used to analyze the}} data. Results from the analyses showed that self employment is common among the males. Education, age, gender, distances, landholding, size of household and value of livestock were significant variables that influenced self employment and income respectively. It was generally accepted that self employment is needful to alleviate the masses unemployment problem and to achieve food security goal of the nations especially Nigeria. It is therefore, recommended that the governmental and non governmental organizations, communities, individuals and corporate bodies should put in place policies that will make land and education available to the masses at a least cost to boost innovations and creativity development...|$|R
40|$|Objective: While {{psychotic}} experiences (PEs) {{are known}} to be associated with a range of mental and general medical disorders, {{little is known about the}} association between PEs and measures of disability. We aimed to investigate this question using the World Mental Health surveys. Method: Lifetime occurrences of six types of PEs were assessed along with 21 mental disorders and 14 general medical conditions. Disability was assessed with a modified version of the WHO Disability Assessment <b>Schedule.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> statistics and logistic regression models were used to investigate the association between PEs and high disability scores (top quartile) with various adjustments. Results: Respondents with PEs were more likely to have top quartile scores on global disability than respondents without PEs (19. 1 % vs. 7. 5 %; chi(2) = 190. 1, P < 0. 001) as well as greater likelihood of cognitive, social, and role impairment. Relationships persisted in each adjusted model. A significant dose-response relationship was also found for the PE type measures with most of these outcomes. Conclusions: Psychotic experiences are associated with disability measures with a dose-response relationship. These results are consistent with the view that PEs are associated with disability regardless of the presence of comorbid mental or general medical disorders...|$|R
40|$|Poverty, {{inequality}} and unemployment challenges {{need to be}} adequately addressed if sustainable human development is to be achieved. Although, these key issues are not mutually exclusive, the thrust {{of this paper is}} to identify some factors influencing rural employment promotion (REP) in southern Nigeria. A multi-stage sampling procedure was used to select 60 rural communities in southern Nigeria. In all, 300 interviewees were sampled and interviewed using structured and unstructured interview <b>schedules.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> statistical techniques such as frequency, percentages, mean and standard deviation, etc. were used to describe and summarise the data collected. Probit analysis was employed to make deductions through the use of STATA package. The result showed a Pseudo R 2 value of 0. 3581, which is quite reasonable for qualitative dependent variable models. At P ≤ 0. 01 level of significance, education (z = 2. 02), farm size (z = 2. 39) positively influenced the drive towards rural employment generation. Also, at P ≤ 0. 01 level, the availability of banking institutions (z = 1. 94) and support from the family members (z = 2. 17) did strongly predict REP. Other predictors of REP were the disaggregated units of project type/orientation, which are production (z = 1. 67) and service-oriented ventures (z = 1. 98) and they both had strong and positive influence on REP at P ≤ 0. 05 and 0. 01 levels of significance, respectively. The paper concludes that the provision of basic and functional services such as education, health care, water, electricity and motorable roads are vital for rural employment promotion drive in rural communities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the role of athletes’ perception of coaches’ leadership behavior as predictor of athletes’ assertiveness in individual sport. 239 individual sport athletes (Xage= 20. 79 ± 3. 32) voluntarily participated to the research. The participants consisted of 170 male (71, 1 %) and 69 female (28. 9 %) athletes from various individual sports such as wrestling, athletics, weightlifting, taekwondo, boxing, karate, badminton etc. The data were collected using a personal information form, Leadership Scale for Sport and Rathus Assertiveness <b>Schedule.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> statistics, Pearson's correlation analysis and hierarchical multiple regression analysis were used in SPSS 17. p<. 05 was determined as the statistical significance value. Results showed that there were positive significant correlations between the subscales of Leadership Scale for Sports (Training and instruction behavior, democraticbehavior, social support behavior and positive feedback behavior) and assertiveness. Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was used to assess the ability of leadership behaviors to predict assertiveness scores of the athletes after controlling for the influence of age and gender. The model explained an additional 21 % variance in assertiveness after controlling for age and gender, R square change =. 21, F change (5, 231) = 12. 833, p<. 05). It appeared in the final model that training and instruction behavior (β=. 45, p<. 05) and autocratic behavior (β= -. 17, p<. 05) were statistically significant. The results indicated that training and instruction behavior of sport coaches could positively contribute to assertiveness score whereas autocratic behavior seems to undermine it in individual sport athletes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the economics of sweet potato production in Kwara State of Nigeria. The study was conducted {{within the framework of}} the rural farming households who constitute the backbone of the Nigerian agricultural sector, producing about 80 per cent of the total national agricultural output with the cutlass-hoe technology and under rain fed conditions. Using cross-sectional data collected from 152 randomly selected sweet potato farmers from Oyun and Offa Local Government Areas of Kwara State, the study measured the profitability of and the technical efficiency of sweet potato production in the area. Primary data were collected from the sampled farming households using a structured interview <b>schedule.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> and inferential statistics was used to analyze the data. A Cobb Douglas production function was further employed to analyze the data using the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure to derive the stochastic frontier production function. The study revealed that the typical sweet potato farmer in the area is a male of about 52 years, with up to 23 years experience in farming and without formal education. The farmers have an average farm size of 1. 05 ha. The study revealed a positive gross margin of N 15, 29315 ha- 1. Farm size, planting material and labour inputs were significant variables having positive impact on sweet potato output. Fertilizer was found to have negative effect on output. The study further revealed a mean technical efficiency of 0. 473. For better efficiency, the land area cultivated, the educational status of the farmers, accessibility to credit facility, and development of the rural areas as well as farmers’ contact with the extension agents are some of the key issues to address. sweet potatoes, technical efficiency, profitability, Kwara State, Agribusiness, Community/Rural/Urban Development, Farm Management,...|$|R

The following information was obtained: (1) current immunization status of own children; (2) which immunizations would currently be accepted for a hypothetical own child and (3) attitudes toward potential modifications of the Swiss immunization <b>schedule.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> methods and multivariate models to correct for covariables were used for data analysis. Nine hundred and fifty-five valid questionnaires were received: 886 / 3704 (23. 9 %) from physicians and 69 / 556 (12. 4 %) from pharmacists. Current (> 95 %) and hypothetical (> 99 %) immunization rates were high for diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis and measles-mumps-rubella. Most pediatricians (61 %) would support more vaccines for their children than currently recommended by the Swiss immunization advisory committee, whereas about 50 % of other physicians and pharmacists would decline at least one of the recommended immunizations, most frequently varicella, pneumococcal or meningococcal C conjugate vaccines. Strong general support was expressed for the expansion of human papillomavirus immunization to males, acceleration of the measles-mumps-rubella schedule and a 2 + 1 instead of 3 + 1 diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, acellular-inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (DTPa-IPV) /Haemophilus influenzae type b ± hepatitis B virus (HBV) schedule. Survey participants generally demonstrated a positive attitude toward immunization, with pediatricians being the most progressive subgroup with the largest percentage of participants (63. 1 %) neither declining nor postponing any recommended immunization...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} tutor {{training on}} the use of adaptive technology in the instruction of Visually Impaired (VI) student teachers in primary Teachers Training Colleges (TTCs) in Kenya. The study was based on the diffusion of innovation theory by Rogers which gives a basis for adoption of innovations in institutions and other settings. The study adopted descriptive survey research design. The study population included administrators, tutors and Visually Impaired (VI) student teachers in three primary teacher training colleges which admit student teachers with visual impairment in Kenya. Purposive sampling technique was used to select three deans of curriculum in the colleges while simple random sampling method was used to select nine Heads of Departments (HOD’s) and 93 tutors making a sample of 105 respondents. The instruments used for data collection were questionnaires and interview <b>schedules.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> statistics such as frequencies and percentages were used to analyse the data. The findings of this study revealed that tutor {{training on the}} integration of adaptive technology for VI student teachers in primary TTC’s was wanting since tutors’ expertise in the integration of adaptive technology was insufficient or totally lacking. This study recommended in-service training of tutors {{on the use of}} adaptive technology devices especially on the use of braille and preparation of tactile diagrams so as to effectively teach VI student teachers in primary TTCs. In addition, the college administration should fully support the use of adaptive technology for VI student teachers and the tutors should be exposed to ways of integrating adaptive technology during the instruction of VI student teachers. The findings of this study are of importance in policy development and implementation on integration of technology in the instructional process for learners with special needs and specifically for those with visual impairments in Kenya {{and other parts of the}} world...|$|R
40|$|The study {{assessed}} {{the role of}} intra-household water management practices in transforming water resources available for agricultural activities in Benue State, Nigeria. Multistage sampling technique was used to select 160 respondents used for the study. Data were collected using interview <b>schedule.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> statistics were used in data analysis. Findings of the study showed that majority (67. 8 %) {{of the respondents indicated}} that women provided drinking water in their households; also majority (71. 3 %) indicated that women provided water for cooking and majority (66. 1 %) stated that women also provided water for laundry (66. 1 %), bathing (65. 5 %), and home cleaning (65. 5 %), while greater proportion (26. 4 %) indicated that boys were responsible for watering of livestock. The result showed that reducing the number of baths per household member (1. 98), reducing the number of times dishes are wished per day (M= 1. 97), watering of gardens in the morning and evening only to reduce evaporation (1. 95) gray water re-use (M= 1. 91), use of alum in purifying water (M= 1. 56), and use of water closet toilets (M= 1. 54) were among the water demand management strategies employed by households in the area. Strategies for improving water availability for households in the area include: participatory risk assessment involving local people and all other stakeholders (M= 3. 90), engaging the beneficiary community for which water provision is planned (M= 3. 88), encouraging local watershed management (M= 3. 88), mainstreaming gender in community water management (M= 3. 79) among others. It was recommended that gender mainstreaming in community water management be encourage so that both men and women will be involved in issues relating to water provision, policy and decision making for the development of water supply infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed at {{developing}} a Home Economics Extension Programme for the socio-economic uplift {{of the urban}} underprivileged women. The study {{was based on the}} theory of extension of Home Economics Education, given by Smith Lever in 1914. Two areas of Lahore viz, Basti Saidan Shah and the Servant Colony Aitchison College, were selected for this purpose. Randomly selected 110 households from each of the two areas, formed the universe of the study. The study was completed in four phases. In the first phase, a general survey of the selected 220 households was conducted. The purpose of the survey was to identify the socio-economic status and needs of the women folk and to pin-point the areas of home-life practices where improvement was imperative so as to help design a Home Economics Extension Programme. Relevant data were collected through an interview <b>schedule.</b> <b>Descriptive</b> statistical techniques were used for analysis of the data and frequency in percent was used for measuring and describing findings of the survey. The second stage of the study was the developmental phase which comprised: a) development of instructional programme b) development of criterion tests A and B c) development of schedule B. On the bases of the findings of the survey, two instructional units, 'Tailoring and Embroidery' from the area of 'Clothing and Textile' and' Food and. Cooking Practices' from the area of 'Foods and Nutrition' were selected for the Extension Programme. Instructional objectives were formulated and the two instructional units were developed {{in the light of the}} objectives. Validity of the instructional objectives and the curricular content was determined by a panel of Home Economics experts in 'Clothing and Textileâ€™ and 'Foods and Nutrition'. The two criterion tests A and B were developed. Test A was a performance test, to measure skill abilities and Test B was an objective type test, to measure knowledge of the subjects. Schedule B was also developed at this stage of the study. It was used to evaluate impact of the Extension Programme on the home-life practices of the subjects. In the third phase of the study, the instructional units were implemented experimentally in class. A sample of 60 females from each of the two localities was drawn from the initial sample of 220 households. They were further split into two subgroups each of 30 subjects to serve as experimental and control groups. Training was then given to the experimental sub-groups for a period of six months in two welfare centres conveniently located in their respective localities. The instructional responsibilities were carried out by the researcher and two equally qualified teachers. The 'randomized control group post-test only' design was adopted for the experiment. Henceforth, the experimental and control groups were post-tested at the completion of the training. The difference between mean scores of the groups on the post-tests, served as a measure to judge efficiency of the instructional programme. The fourth phase of the study focused on evaluation of the extension programme. It was completed in two steps, a) evaluation of the efficiency of the training programme and b) evaluation of the impact of the extension programme on the socio-economic conditions (use of skills and improvement in home-life practices) of the subjects. The two hypotheses formulated for the purpose of evaluation of the instructional programme were: 1. There is no significant difference in the income generating skills of the underprivileged women with or without the application of Home Economics Programme. 2. There is no significant difference in the basic knowledge of foods and cooking practices of the underprivileged women with or without the application of Home Economics Extension Programme. Hypotheses No. 1 and 2 were put to test immediately on completion of the experiment and were rejected on the bases of statistical analysis. After applying one tailed t-test it was concluded that the training programme proved effective for developing income generating skills and for enhancing knowledge related to foods and cooking practices of the subjects.. Evaluation of the impact of the extension programme on the socio-economic conditions (use of acquired knowledge and skills) was carried out, six months after completion of the experiment. Schedule B was administered to both the groups twice. It was administered at the beginning of the experiment and then six months after completion of the experiment. Responses of the subjects were analysed and described in percent frequencies. The difference between frequencies of responses of the subjects before the experiment and frequencies of responses, six months after completion of the experiment, were used to measure and ascertain impact of the programme on the socio-economic status of the subjects. Findings of the study depicted a trend towards improvement in economic and social conditions of the subject...|$|R
