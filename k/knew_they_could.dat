5|$|The {{original}} Ace Cafe {{was based}} on the North Circular Road. Open 24 hours a day, it catered for late-night party-goers and boy racers. It was a popular place for cars to be hot-wired and stolen, as drivers <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> make a quick getaway. Regus founder Mark Dixon's first business on returning to Britain after an extended time aboard was a hot-dog stand on the North Circular Road, making his own buns. He grew the business into a full-time bakery which he sold in 1989 for £800,000 (now £).|$|E
5|$|Clark's {{relationships}} with the other characters evolved {{over the course of}} the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a yin and yang type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite. His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not, which inhibited their friendship.|$|E
5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. I am told there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E

5|$|Producers chose {{boys who}} were {{students}} of Tariq bin Ziad High School. The school was {{holding on to the}} notion of a united Iraq, even as the country was becoming increasingly racially and religiously segregated. Having worked in Iraq in 2003, Winter knew that the Baghdad district Karrada was mixed and integrated with high numbers of Shiites and Christians. She asked her former driver and translator, who had attended the school, if he would contact the principal. Initially the school was suspicious of their intentions, but decided to trust the judgement of Winter's translator. Principal Ra'ad Jawad selected eight boys {{to take part in the}} documentary because he <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be discreet about making the documentary, would not get bored, and would remain committed to filming their lives for a year. The producers wanted their cast to include girls, and had found a school and families willing to take part in the documentary, but the then-Minister of Education refused to let them take part. Jawad travelled to London to meet the producers and he was trained to operate the video cameras that the boys were to use. The cameras and tapes were sent into Iraq via the BBC News department, which were then passed onto the school. Jawad and two Iraqi associate producers trained the boys how to use the cameras. Two months into filming, four of the boys dropped out of the project, leaving Hayder Khalid, Anmar Refat, Ali Shadman, and Mohammad Raed. O'Mahoney and Winter never met the boys while the documentary was being produced because it was such a high-risk assignment.|$|E
25|$|When the {{campaign}} began, Lenihan {{was seen as}} a near certainty to win the presidency. The only question asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second. However, as {{the campaign}} proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender. Crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey and the rising popularity of the Labour Party leader Dick Spring. Notwithstanding, Fianna Fáil <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> count on Lenihan to mount a barnstorming campaign in the last few weeks.|$|E
25|$|With the Sportimes {{finishing}} with WTT's worst record in 2013, the Aviators had the top pick in each round of both WTT drafts. With the first overall selection in the marquee player draft, the Aviators chose Bob and Mike Bryan {{whom they had}} protected as a doubles team. Thus, the identical twins simultaneously became the first players who could call themselves San Diego Aviators. With the first pick {{in the second round}} of the marquee player draft (ninth overall), the Aviators selected Daniela Hantuchová who committed to playing in WTT full-time for the 2014 season. The Aviators protected Květa Peschke, making her the only holdover player from the 2013 Sportimes on the 2014 Aviators' roster. With the first pick in the first round of the roster player draft, the Aviators selected Somdev Devvarman. They used their second round choice for Raven Klaasen. With Hantuchová committed to playing full-time, the Aviators knew they did not need all four of their picks in the roster draft. They also <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> wait until the fourth round to take Peschke whom they had protected. So, the Aviators traded their third round pick to the Springfield Lasers in exchange for the Lasers' fourth round pick and cash consideration. The Aviators used their fourth round pick (22nd overall) to draft Peschke and passed on the fourth round pick (27th overall) that they acquired in the trade with the Lasers, since their roster was full.|$|E

The South Korean forces had far less training and were poorly equipped, and so they presented the weakest line on the Pusan Perimeter. The North Koreans <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be most successful there.|$|E
500|$|... "Park Safety" [...] {{was written}} by Aisha Muharrar and {{directed}} by Michael Trim. It featured a guest appearance by comedian Andy Samberg as Carl, the park ranger. Samberg and Parks and Recreation star Amy Poehler previously appeared together as regular cast members in the NBC sketch comedy series, Saturday Night Live. The role of Carl was written with Samberg in mind because the writing staff <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get him as a guest appearance as long as filming corresponded with his Saturday Night Live schedule, although the character was tweaked slightly when it was confirmed Samberg would definitely play him. Samberg also knew most of the supporting cast, writers and staff when the episode was filmed. During an interview about his performance in the episode, Samberg jokingly responded: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1910, {{the pair}} sought {{to return to}} the United States, but <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not escape scandal if they {{returned}} together to Oak Park. Wright saw an alternative—his family's ancestral farm near Spring Green, Wisconsin. Wright returned alone to the United States in late 1910, publicly reconciling with Kitty while working to secure money to buy land for a house for himself and Borthwick. On April3, 1911, Wright wrote to a friend requesting money to purchase [...] "a small house" [...] for his mother. By the 10th, Wright's mother Anna had a signed deed for the property. By using Anna's name, Wright was able to secure the [...] property without attracting any attention to the affair. Late in the summer, Mamah Borthwick (having divorced Cheney and legally reverting to her maiden name) quietly moved into the property, staying with Wright's sister at Tan-y-Deri. However, Wright and Borthwick's new property was discovered by a Chicago Examiner reporter that fall, and the affair made headlines in the Chicago Tribune on Christmas Eve.|$|E

Praise for Liverpool also came from outside England, including from Argentine legend Diego Maradona, who said, [...] "Even the Brazil team that won the 1970 World Cup could not have staged a comeback with Milan leading 3–0...The English club proved that miracles really do exist. I've now made Liverpool my English team. They showed that football {{is the most beautiful}} sport of all. You <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> defend, but the team showed they could play too and wrote a page in the history books. The match will last forever. The Liverpool supporters didn't let me go to sleep the night before. There were 10 of them to every three Milan supporters. They showed their unconditional support at half-time when they were losing 3–0 and still they didn't stop singing." ...|$|E

Opposition players <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get at Jackson by giving her sneaky fouls and nettling her back with some trash talk. While playing in the WNBA, she has dyed her hair different colours several times. She ranks 35th in the league for total played games with 308.

500|$|The WHA {{merged with}} the NHL {{following}} the 1978–79 season. Birmingham was not {{invited to join the}} NHL; the team instead joined the Central Hockey League for the 1979–80 season and became a minor league affiliate of the Atlanta Flames. [...] Henderson considered retiring, but his family had settled in Birmingham and he <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> remain in the United States only {{as long as he was}} employed. The Flames offered him a spot on their roster, but he preferred to remain with his family. [...] He signed a two-year contract with the Flames on the promise that he would stay in Birmingham unless the team needed his services as a result of injury to other players. He spent the majority of the season in Birmingham, but when Atlanta did struggle with injuries, they recalled him for 30 games where he scored seven goals and six assists. Henderson also appeared in four playoff games. In his final game at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens, Henderson led the Flames to a 5–1 win over the Maple Leafs with a two-goal effort, resulting in his being named the game's first star.|$|E

[...] He wrote, [...] "his is not my concept, and I am sure would not be the Framers’, of a people secure from unreasonable searches and seizures." [...] Justice Scalia argued that anonymous tips are inherently unreliable, because anonymous tipsters can [...] "lie with impunity." [...] While he admitted 911 calls are, in fact, easily traceable, Justice Scalia {{argued that the}}re was no evidence the 911 caller <b>knew</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be identified when they placed the call. Additionally, Justice Scalia distinguished the tip in this case from the tip in White, where [...] "the reliability of the tip was established {{by the fact that it}} predicted the target’s behavior in the finest detail — a detail that could be known only by someone familiar with the target’s business." [...] He argued that the general details provided in this case's 911 call were unreliable, because [...] "everyone in the world who saw the car would have that knowledge, and anyone who wanted the car stopped would have to provide that information." [...] Likewise, Justice Scalia argued that there was no evidence that the report of being run off the road was actually true.|$|E
