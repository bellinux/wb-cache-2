40|$|A {{method for}} the {{autonomous}} geolocation of ground vehicles in forest environments is presented. The method provides {{an estimate of}} the global horizontal position of a vehicle strictly based on finding a geometric match between a map of observed tree stems, scanned in 3 D by Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors onboard the vehicle, to another stem map generated from the structure of tree crowns analyzed from aerial orthoimagery of the forest canopy. Identification of stems from 3 D data is achieved by using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers and height above ground filters that separate ground points from vertical stem features. Identifications of stems from overhead imagery is achieved by calculating the centroids of tree crowns extracted using a watershed segmentation algorithm. Matching of the two stem maps is achieved by using a robust Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that determines the rotation and translation required to align both datasets. The final alignment is used to calculate the absolute location of the vehicle. The localization algorithm has been tested with real-world data and has been able to estimate vehicle geoposition with errors of less than 2. 1 m RMS. It is noted that the algorithm's accuracy is currently limited by the accuracy and resolution of the aerial orthoimagery used. This method can be used in real-time as a complement to the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) in areas where signal coverage is inadequate due to attenuation by the forest canopy, or due to intentional denied access. The method has two key properties that are significant: i) It does not require a priori knowledge of the area surrounding the robot. ii) Based on estimated vehicle state, it uses the geometry of detected tree stems as the only input to determine horizontal geoposition. by Marwan <b>Hussein.</b> Thesis: <b>S.</b> M. in Engineering and Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Engineering Systems Division, System Design and Management Program, 2014.

As LTE deployments move towards femto and pico cells, even operators struggle to fully understand the propagation and interference patterns affecting their service, particularly indoors. This thesis introduces LTEye, the first open platform to monitor and analyze LTE radio performance at a fine temporal and spatial granularity. LTEye accesses the LTE PHY layer without requiring private user information or provider support. It provides deep insights into the PHY-layer protocols deployed in these networks. LTEye's analytics enable researchers and policy makers to uncover serious deficiencies in these networks due to inefficient spectrum utilization and inter-cell interference. In addition, LTEye extends synthetic aperture radar (SAR), widely used for radar and backscatter signals, to operate over cellular signals. This enables businesses and end-users to localize mobile users and capture the distribution of LTE performance across spatial locations in their facility. As a result, they can diagnose problems and better plan deployment of repeaters or femto cells.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether paracrine signalling {{between the}} bovine oocyte and cumulus cells is altered {{during the course}} of in vitro maturation (IVM). Bovine COCs were cocultured with denuded oocytes or treated with specific oocyte-secreted factors, namely recombinant bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) - 15 or growth differentiation factor (GDF) - 9, beginning from 0 or 9 h IVM. To generate a 9 -h denuded oocyte (DO) group, COCs were cultured intact for the first 9 h of IVM and then denuded. Coculturing intact COCs with DOs denuded immediately after collection or following 9 h of maturation did not affect cleavage rate, but improved blastocyst yield (P < 0. 05) on Day 8 (51 and 61 %, respectively; P < 0. 05) and cell number compared with COCs cultured alone (41 %). Significantly, we observed higher levels of endogenous GDF- 9 and BMP- 15 protein in oocytes of COCs matured for 9 h compared with no incubation. The addition of 175 ng mL– 1 GDF- 9 or 10 % v/v BMP- 15 from partially purified transfected 293 H cell supernatant for 24 h IVM significantly enhanced development to the blastocyst stage from 40 % (control) to 51 and 47 %, respectively (P < 0. 05). However, treatment of COCs with GDF- 9 or BMP- 15 between 9 and 24 h of IVM did not increase blastocyst yield. These results provide evidence of quantitative and possibly qualitative temporal changes in oocyte paracrine factor production during IVM. Tamer <b>S.</b> <b>Hussein,</b> Melanie L.

The study included two experiments. Experiment 1 included 40 male residents of an orphanage aged 16 – 19 years, who were divided into four groups (n = 10 each) and subjected to total sleep deprivation, normal sleep, early-night sleep deprivation, or late-night sleep deprivation. Experiment 2 included eight students from the same institution who were divided into the same four groups (n = 2) as in experiment 1. Declarative memory was tested using lists of associated word pairs in both experiments, and activation of the relevant brain regions was measured before and after retrieval by single-photon emission computed tomography for subjects in experiment 2 only. Results: Students subjected to normal sleep had significantly higher scores for declarative memory retrieval than those subjected to total sleep deprivation (P = 0. 002), early-night sleep deprivation (P = 0. 005), or late-night sleep deprivation (P = 0. 02). The left temporal lobe showed the highest rate of activity during memory retrieval after normal sleep, whereas the frontal, parietal, and right temporal lobes were more active after sleep deprivation. Conclusion: Both slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement sleep play an active role in consolidation of declarative memory, which in turn allows memory traces to be actively reprocessed and strengthened during sleep, leading to improved performance in memory recall.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of fully grown oocytes to regulate their own microenvironment by paracrine factors secreted by the oocyte (oocyte-secreted factors, OSFs) may in turn contribute to oocyte developmental competence. Here, we investigated if OSFs {{have a direct}} influence on oocyte developmental competence during in vitro maturation (IVM). Bovine cumulus–oocyte complexes (COCs) were aspirated from abattoir-derived ovaries and matured in serum-free medium. COCs were either co-cultured with denuded oocytes (DOs) or treated with specific OSFs: recombinant bone morphogenetic protein 15 (BMP 15) and/or growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF 9). Following maturation, embryos were fertilized and cultured in vitro and blastocyst development and cell number were assessed on day 8. Co-culturing intact COCs with DOs did not affect cleavage rate, but increased (P < 0. 001) the proportion of cleaved embryos that reached the blastocyst stage post-insemination from 39 % to 51 %. OSFs also altered blastocyst cell allocation as co-culture of COCs with DOs significantly increased total and trophectoderm cell numbers, compared to control COCs. BMP 15 alone, GDF 9 alone or the two combined all (P < 0. 05) increased the proportion of oocytes that reached the blastocyst stage post-insemination from 41 % (controls) to 58 %, 50 % and 55 %, respectively. These results were further verified in neutralization experiments of the exogenous growth factors and of the native OSFs. Follistatin and the kinase inhibitor SB- 431542, which antagonize BMP 15 and GDF 9, respectively, neutralized the stimulatory effects of the exogenous growth factors and impaired the developmental competence of control COCs. These results demonstrate that OSFs, and particularly BMP 15 and GDF 9, enhance oocyte developmental competence and provide evidence that OSF regulation of the COC microenvironment is an important determinant of oocyte developmental programming.

40|$|T- 2 toxin is a {{very stable}} {{mycotoxin}} produced by Fusarium spp. which often {{ends up in the}} food and feed chain. It poses a threat to human and animal health, especially to pigs which appear {{to be one of the}} most sensitive species (Hussein and Brasel, 2001). Besides mycotoxins, Salmonella Typhimurium infections are a major issue in swine production. Therefore, the aim of the presented study was to investigate the effects of T- 2 toxin on the course of a Salmonella Typhimurium infection in pigs. 	We conducted an animal trial in which 3 -week-old Salmonella-free piglets were randomized into three groups of 5 piglets. During 23 days, they received ad libitum blank feed (control group), feed contaminated with 10 µg/kg T- 2 toxin (10 ppb group) or feed contaminated with 100 µg/kg T- 2 toxin (100 ppb group). The pigs were orally inoculated with 2 x 107 colony forming units (CFU) of Salmonella Typhimurium. Five days after inoculation, the pigs were humanely euthanized and samples of intestinal contents and tissues were taken for bacteriological analysis. Compared to the control group, the 10 ppb and 100 ppb group showed lower numbers of Salmonella Typhimurium in jejunum, cecum (p < 0. 05) and colon tissue, and cecum (p < 0. 05) and colon contents. These results show that the presence of low and in practice relevant concentrations of T- 2 toxin in the feed reduces the colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in the intestine. 	To elucidate the cause of this reduced colonization, we investigated the effects of T- 2 toxin on the host-pathogen interactions of Salmonella Typhimurium and on the gene expression of the bacterium, in vitro. We showed that very low concentrations of T- 2 toxin (1 - 10 ng/ml) promote the susceptibility of porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) and intestinal porcine epithelial cells (IPEC-J 2) to Salmonella Typhimurium invasion, but not to intracellular proliferation of the bacterium. Furthermore we demonstrated that T- 2 toxin promotes the translocation of Salmonella Typhimurium over an IPEC-J 2 monolayer, at concentrations (1 - 5 ng/ml) that did not exert a notable effect on porcine cell viability and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). These in vitro findings show that T- 2 toxin might result in enhanced colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in pigs. However, microarray analysis showed that T- 2 toxin, at a concentration as low as 5 ng/ml, reduces expression of Salmonella Typhimurium motility genes flgL, flgM and flgK. It also causes a general downregulation of the metabolism of Salmonella Typhimurium, which could lead to a decreased colonization of the bacterium. Probably, in vivo, T- 2 toxin influences the gene expression of the bacterium before the cell-mediated effect takes place. 	In conclusion, T- 2 toxin significantly affects the gene expression and host-pathogen interactions of Salmonella Typhimurium resulting in a reduced colonization of the bacteria in pigs.

40|$|Cells {{are capable}} of {{adhering}} to and migrating on protein components of the extracellular matrix. These cell-matrix interactions {{are thought to be}} mediated largely through a family of cell surface receptors termed integrins. However, the manner in which individual integrins are involved in cell adhesion and motility has not been fully determined. To explore this issue, we previously selected a series of CHO variants that are deficient in expression of the integrin alpha 5 beta 1, the "classical" fibronectin receptor. Two sets of subclones of these variants were defined which respectively express approximately 20 % or 2 % of fibronectin receptor on the cell surface when compared to wild- type cells (Schreiner, C. L., J. S. Bauer, Y. N. Danilov, <b>S.</b> <b>Hussein,</b> M. M. Sczekan, and R. L. Juliano. 1989. J. Cell Biol. 109 : 3157 - 3167). In the current study, the variant clones were tested for haptotactic motility on substrata coated with fibronectin or vitronectin. Data from assays using fibronectin show that cellular motility of the 20 % variants was substantially decreased (30 - 75 % of wild type), while the motility of the 2 % variants was nearly abolished (2 - 20 % of wild type). Surprisingly, a similar pattern was seen for haptotactic motility of both 2 % and 20 % variants when vitronectin was used (approximately 20 - 30 % of wild type). The reduced haptotactic motility of the fibronectin receptor-deficient variant clones on vitronectin was shown not to be due to reduced vitronectin receptor (alpha v beta 3) expression nor to a failure of these variants to adhere to vitronectin substrata. Transfection of the deficient variants with a cDNA for the human alpha 5 subunit resulted in normal levels of fibronectin receptor expression (as a human alpha 5 /hamster beta 1 chimera) and restored the motility of the CHO variants on fibronectin and vitronectin. This indicates that expression of the alpha 5 subunit is required for normal haptotactic motility on vitronectin substrata and suggests that the fibronectin receptor (alpha 5 beta 1) plays a cooperative role with vitronectin receptors in cell motility...|$|R
40|$|The Company of Biologists Ltd 2005 Paracrine factors {{secreted}} by the oocyte regulate a {{broad range}} of cumulus cell functions. Characteristically, cumulus cells have a low incidence of apoptosis and we proposed that this is due to oocyte-secreted factors acting in an anti-apoptotic manner. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) were aspirated from abattoir-derived ovaries and oocytectomized (OOX) by microsurgical removal of the oocyte. OOX were treated with doses of either denuded oocytes (DO) or various growth factors for 24 hours (± rFSH; 0. 1 IU/ml). Proportions of apoptotic cumulus cells were assessed using TUNEL and laser confocal scanning microscopy followed by image analysis. Quantification of Bcl- 2 and Bax proteins in OOX was undertaken by western analysis. Oocyte removal led to a significant increase in cumulus cell apoptosis compared with COC controls (35 % versus 9 % TUNEL positive, respectively; P< 0. 001). Levels of OOX apoptosis were significantly reversed (P< 0. 001) in a dose-dependent manner when co-cultured with oocytes. Furthermore, the anti-apoptotic effect of oocyte-secreted factors followed a gradient from the site of the oocyte(s). Growth differentiation factor 9 (GDF 9) had no significant effect on cumulus cell apoptosis. By contrast, cumulus cell apoptosis was significantly (P< 0. 001) reduced by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) 15, 6 or 7. Accordingly, levels of antiapoptotic Bcl- 2 were high in OOX+DO and OOX+BMP 15 and low with OOX+GDF 9 or OOX alone, whereas the reverse was observed for pro-apoptotic Bax. DO, BMP 15 and BMP 6 were also able to protect cumulus cells from undergoing apoptosis induced by staurosporine. FSH partially prevented apoptosis in all treatment groups (P< 0. 001). Follistatin and a BMP 6 neutralizing antibody, which antagonized the anti-apoptotic effects of BMP 15 and BMP 6, respectively, whether alone or combined, blocked ~ 50 % of the anti-apoptotic actions of oocytes. These results are the first to demonstrate that oocyte-secreted factors, and particularly BMP 15 and BMP 6, maintain the low incidence of cumulus cell apoptosis by establishing a localized gradient of bone morphogenetic proteins.

40|$|Introduction : Worldwide, Salmonella Typhimurium is the {{predominant}} serovar isolated from slaughter pigs, {{and one of}} the major causes of foodborne salmonellosis in humans (1). Besides Salmonella infections, T- 2 toxin contamination of various feed and food commodities, poses a serious threat to human and animal health (2), especially to pigs which seem {{to be one of the}} most sensitive species to many mycotoxins (3). Moderate to high levels of T- 2 toxin cause feed refusal, vomiting, weight loss, reduced growth, skin lesions and immunosuppression in pigs, resulting in considerable economic losses (4). A strategy for reducing the exposure to mycotoxins is the use of mycotoxin-adsorbing agents in the feed (5). Some of these mycotoxin-adsorbing agents might however affect the pathogenesis of a Salmonella Typhimurium infection. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of a modified glucomannan detoxifying agent on the course of a Salmonella Typhimurium infection in T- 2 toxin exposed and unexposed pigs. Materials and methods : An in vivo trial (three-week-old piglets) was performed in which four different pig diets were provided during 23 days: a diet which was free of mycotoxins, a diet containing 1. 0 g of a modified glucomannan binder (Mycosorb®) per kg feed, a diet containing 83 ± 31. 5 µg T- 2 toxin per kg feed and a diet containing 83 ± 31. 5 µg T- 2 toxin per kg feed supplemented with 1. 0 g of the modified glucomannan binder per kg feed. At day 18 of the feeding period, all pigs were inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium and five days later the pigs were euthanized and organ samples were collected for bacteriological analysis. Furthermore, the binding capacity of the modified glucomannan binder for Salmonella Typhimurium was examined in vitro. For this purpose, Salmonella Typhimurium was added to 1 ml aqua dest whether or not supplemented with 20 mg of the modified glucomannan binder and incubated at 37 °C on a shaker. Immediately and 4 hours after incubation, the number of Salmonella bacteria was assessed by plating 10 -fold dilutions of the solution on Brilliant Green Agar plates. Results : The ingestion of 83 ± 31. 5 µg T- 2 toxin per kg feed by pigs resulted in a significant reduction of weight gain (%) compaired to control pigs that received blank feed. We showed that the addition of the modified glucomannan binder to feed contaminated with 83 µg T- 2 toxin per kg feed, neutralized this reduced weight gain. Supplementation of the feed with T- 2 toxin, the modified glucomannan mycotoxin-adsorbing agent or the combination of both, resulted in a reduced colonization of Salmonella Typhimurium in comparison to control pigs that received blank feed. Furthermore, we showed that after 4 hours, the modified glucomannan binder significantly reduced the number of Salmonella bacteria in aqua dest in comparison to the start of the incubation period and to aqua dest without the modified glucomannan binder. Discussion and conclusions : We highlighted the protective role of the mycotoxin-adsorbing agent tested here, against T- 2 toxin induced weight loss in pigs. We also provided evidence that it captures Salmonella bacteria, resulting in a reduced colonization of the porcine intestine. References : (1) Fisher, I.

40|$|The {{study of}} {{metabolic}} alterations {{in response to}} genetic and environmental perturbations has been a central topic in microbial metabolomics (Fiehn, 2002; Kol et al., 2010; Villas-Boas et al., 2008). Some of these alterations can be readily detected by changes in their surroundings, normally associated with metabolites that are released by cells as by-products of the metabolism or as extracellular signalling molecules to mediate cross-talk within microbial communities. The analysis of these metabolites, also known as metabolic footprinting, has been widely applied with different purposes: discriminating between metabolic phenotypes in order to classify and identify mutant strains (Villas-Boas et al., 2008); monitoring bioprocesses with the aim to detect specific metabolites that indicate alterations in the culture performance (Carneiro et al., 2011; Sue et al., 2011); and identifying quorum-sensing metabolites that indicate potential targets to annihilate pathogens (Birkenstock et al., 2012). These metabolic readouts have been also useful to give insights into intracellular metabolic activities and provide a straightforward way to analyse simultaneously multiple metabolic activities, since no extraction procedures are required to analyse the endometabolome (i. e., intracellular metabolites). Thus, through metabolic footprint analysis we can assess central metabolic activities that characterize the reproduction and survival of organisms. We have developed a methodology to evaluate the metabolic state of microbial cultures by analysing the footprints of two microbial systems: the bacterium Escherichia coli and the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori. Strategies for sampling and sample preparation were developed, {{as well as the}} analytical procedures based on gas chromatography with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). A wide variety of metabolites was detected, including fatty, amino and organic acids, which allowed us to address changes in most central metabolic pathways, such as the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle), the biosynthesis of amino and fatty acids, as well as other energy generating metabolic reactions. The analysis of extracellular metabolites of E. coli cultures at different growth conditions were first performed to discriminate the physiological state of cultures and to evaluate the metabolic alterations produced at different growth conditions. According to our results in these experiments, metabolic footprints are good indicators of alterations in the intracellular metabolism. Next, the metabolic footprints of H. pylori cultures were investigated to get insights on the catabolism of this human pathogen. Overall, fifteen amino acids were detected in extracellular medium; six of them were confirmed as essentials for H. pylori growth, four amino acids were identified as non-essentials and can be used as carbon source, whilst five amino acids were identified as non-essentials and non-carbon source. In addition, some organic acids were also identified as carbon sources for H. pylori. This metabolic footprint analysis of H. pylori cultures allowed us to uncover key metabolic activities, mainly related with amino acids catabolism and to get insight on the metabolic behaviour of this organism. The characterization of catabolic pathways, as well as of possible metabolic constraints, is of major importance to understand the dynamic basis of the interactions host–microbe in the human gut, and in particular to discover potential ‘diagnostic’ biomarkers. It is well-known that pathogen's metabolism can influence the host health and may affect drug metabolism, toxicity and the efficacy of therapies (Holmes et al., 2011). However, little is known about their metabolic structure and behaviour. Our methodology allows uncovering part of the metabolic structure of H. pylori metabolism and undisclosed catabolic activities.
