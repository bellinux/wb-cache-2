25|$|The four chosen {{systems were}} the Bendix Dashaveyor, the Ford ACT, TTI <b>Hovair</b> (a {{spin-off}} of General Motors) and the Rohr ROMAG, represented by its former rubber-wheeled prototype, the Monocab. Boeing and Vought also showed cars from their larger systems, Boeing's {{version of the}} Alden staRRcar being installed in Morgantown, and the Vought Airtrans being installed at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Ford would later install a small ACT deployment at a shopping mall in Dearborn, and Dashaveyor would win a contest for the Toronto Zoo Domain Ride, but further sales were not forthcoming. Several European companies also presented models of their designs. The plans to use Transpo {{as a way to}} excite mayors into buying the AGT systems failed, a disappointment to both the UMTA and Congress.|$|E
5000|$|Otis <b>Hovair</b> Transit Systems {{is a type}} of {{hovertrain}} used in low-speed {{people mover}} applications. Traditional people mover systems used wheeled vehicles propelled by electric motors or cable traction, the <b>Hovair</b> replaces the wheels with a hovercraft lift pad. The aim is to reduce guideway complexity and vehicle maintenance. Another benefit is the system's ability to move in all directions, including sideways. The <b>Hovair</b> is the only hovertrain system to be used in commercial service.|$|E
50|$|Today, air casters are {{manufactured}} by several companies worldwide, such as Airfloat, Air Caster Corp, AeroGo, <b>Hovair,</b> Solving, Vertex, and Aerofilm Systems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Hovair</b> {{technology}} has been installed around the world. Later variants have used the same air-cushion technology, but propelled the vehicles by wire cable, such as at the Getty Center in Los Angeles.|$|E
5000|$|The proclaimed [...] "horizontal elevator" [...] {{system was}} {{designed}} by Otis Elevator Company during the 1970s, installed beginning in 1977 and opened on December 8, 1979. The PRT had with three driverless Otis <b>Hovair</b> vehicles which had a hinged-window at each end for emergency exit.|$|E
5000|$|Otis {{has also}} dabbled in {{horizontal}} automated people-mover [...] "shuttle" [...] systems, {{such as the}} Otis <b>Hovair.</b> In 1996, Otis formed a joint venture called [...] "Poma-Otis Transportation Systems" [...] with the French company Pomagalski to promote these products, however the partnership has since ended.|$|E
50|$|The Getty Center Monorail, {{also known}} as Getty Center Tram, is an Otis <b>Hovair</b> {{monorail}} of the U.S. city of Los Angeles serving the Getty Center. It is an electric, cable-driven hovertrain, with a fleet of 6 people movers divided in 2 convoys of 3 cars each.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles on the {{parallel}} 1138 m long guideways are drawn by steel cables and float on an approximately 0.2 mm thick air cushion generated by on board air compressors, running over a smooth concrete guide way {{as in other}} Otis <b>Hovair</b> installations. Service is provided {{by a total of}} nine cars, which operate in three trains of three cars each, with each train carrying up to 157 passengers.|$|E

5000|$|Hovertrains {{were also}} {{developed}} for smaller systems, including {{personal rapid transit}} systems that were a hot topic in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In this role their ability to float over small imperfections and debris on the [...] "rails" [...] was a practical advantage, although it competed with the maglev concept that had the same advantages. The only hovertain to see commercial service was the Otis <b>Hovair</b> system. Originally developed at General Motors as an automated guideway transit system, GM was forced to divest the design {{as part of an}} anti-trust ruling. The design eventually ended up at Otis Elevator who later replaced its linear motor with a cable pull and sold the resulting design for people mover installations all over the world.|$|E
50|$|The newer {{of the two}} systems, the C Concourse People Mover, {{opened on}} May 5, 2004. Covering a {{distance}} of 2700 ft, this tram is designed to quickly transport passengers between the concourses of the Lindbergh Terminal on two independent routes, one located airside and the other located landside. Costing $36 million to complete, the C Concourse tram was originally scheduled to open on June 1, 2002, but computer software problems and a collision with the vehicles resulted in postponing its opening to 2004.The four cars utilized in this system have an average top speed of 26 mph and, although {{the appearance of the}} vehicles is similar to the Hub Tram, they use steel wheels on steel tracks as the C Concourse line is above ground and open to the elements, where ice and snow could interfere with the operation of the air cushions had it been built with <b>Hovair</b> technology.|$|E
