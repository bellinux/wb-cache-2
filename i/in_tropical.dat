5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{considered to}} have a circumglobal distribution <b>in</b> <b>tropical</b> oceans throughout the world, recent authorities have restricted the true Aetobatus narinari to the Atlantic Ocean based on genetic and morphologic evidence.

5|$|In 1953, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{launched}} an antimalarial program {{in parts of}} Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication <b>in</b> <b>tropical</b> Africa.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>tropical</b> {{regions with}} a monsoon or monsoon-like climate, where a drier {{part of the}} year {{alternates}} with a wet period as in the Amazon rainforest, different species of broad-leaved trees dominate the forest, some of them being deciduous. <b>In</b> <b>tropical</b> regions with a drier savanna climate and insufficient rainfall to support dense forests, the canopy is not closed, and plenty of sunshine reaches the ground which is covered with grass and scrub. Acacia and baobab are well adapted to living in such areas.|$|E
5|$|Information is sparse for {{earlier years}} due to {{limitations}} <b>in</b> <b>tropical</b> cyclone observation, though as coastlines became more populated, more data became available.

5|$|Sponges {{are more}} {{abundant}} but less diverse in temperate waters than <b>in</b> <b>tropical</b> waters, possibly because organisms that prey on sponges are more abundant <b>in</b> <b>tropical</b> waters.
