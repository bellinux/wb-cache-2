40|$|Introduction: Patients and {{the public}} are {{beginning}} to use digital health tools to assist in managing chronic illness, support independent living and self-care, and remain connected to health and care providers. However, engaging with and enrolling in digital health interventions, such as telehealth systems, mobile health applications, patient portals and personal health records, {{in order to use}} them varies considerably. Many factors affect people's ability to engage with and sign up to digital health platforms. Objectives: The primary aim is to identify the barriers and facilitators patients {{and the public}} experience to <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> to digital health interventions. The secondary aim is to identify engagement and enrolment strategies, leading if possible to a taxonomy of such approaches, and a conceptual framework of digital health <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes. Methods: A systematic review of qualitative studies will be conducted by searching six databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and the ACM Digital Library for papers published between 2000 and 2015. Titles and abstracts along with full-text papers will be screened by two independent reviewers against predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A data extraction form will be used to provide details of the included studies. Quality assessment will be conducted using the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist. Any disagreements will be resolved through discussion with an independent third reviewer. Analysis will be guided by framework synthesis and informed by normalization process theory and burden of treatment theory, to aid conceptualisation of digital health <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes. Discussion: This systematic review of qualitative studies will explore factors affecting engagement and enrolment in digital health interventions.

40|$|Every {{organization}} necessitates personnel planning {{as one of}} {{the most}} vital activities. Human Resource Planning is, by far, an essential ingredient for the success of any organization in the long run. There are a number of techniques that need to be followed by every organization that guarantees that it possesses the right number and type of people, at the right time and right place, so as to enable the organization to achieve its planned objectives. This paper is an attempt to identify a relationship between recruitment and selection in the process of engaging employees in the organization. A primary survey is conducted at Mathrubhumi Printing & Publishing Co. Ltd to establish this relationship. A sample study is conducted to determine the relationship between employee <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> /selection. Recruitment function in the organization plays a pivotal role.

40|$|We {{hypothesised}} that embedding educational {{learning in}} a game would improve learning outcomes, with increased <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of cognitive resources evidenced by increased activation of working memory network (WMN) and deactivation of Default Mode Network (DMN) regions. In an fMRI study, we compared activity during periods of learning in three conditions that were increasingly game-like: Study-only (when periods of learning were followed by an exemplar question together with its correct answer), Self-quizzing (when periods of learning were followed by a multiple choice question {{in return for a}} fixed number of points) and Game-based (when, following each period of learning, participants competed with a peer to answer the question for escalating, uncertain rewards). DMN hubs deactivated as conditions became more game-like, alongside greater self-reported engagement and, in the Game-based condition, higher learning scores. These changes did not occur with any detectable increase in WMN activity. Additionally, ventral striatal activation was associated with responding to questions and receiving positive question feedback. Results support the significance of DMN deactivation for educational learning, and are aligned with recent evidence suggesting DMN and WMN activity may not always be anti-correlated...|$|E

Context: HIV/AIDS in the United States {{continues}} to primarily impact {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM), with disproportionately high rates among black MSM. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify factors that may influence <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> retention of black MSM in HIV research. Design and Participants: This was a qualitative evaluation of study implementation within a multisite, prospective, observational study (HIV Prevention Trials Network 061, BROTHERS) that enrolled 1553 black MSM in 6 cities throughout the United States. Data collection for this evaluation included a written, structured survey collected from each of the sites describing site characteristics including staff and organizational structure, reviews of site standard operating procedures, and work plans; semistructured key informant interviews were conducted with site coordinators to characterize staffing, site-level factors facilitating or impeding effective community <b>engagement,</b> study <b>recruitment,</b> <b>and</b> retention. Data from completed surveys and site standard operating procedures were collated, and notes from key informant interviews were thematically coded for content by 2 independent reviewers. Results: Several key themes emerged from the data, including the importance of inclusion of members of the community being studied as staff, institutional hiring practices that support inclusive staffing, cultivating a supportive working environment for study implementation, and ongoing relationships between research institutions and community. Conclusions: This study underscores the importance of staffing in implementing research with black MSM.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} how doctors considered and experienced the concept of equipoise while recruiting patients to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Study Design and SettingIn-depth interviews with 32 doctors in six publicly funded pragmatic RCTs explored their perceptions of equipoise as they undertook RCT recruitment. The RCTs varied in size, duration, type of complex intervention, and clinical specialties. Interview data were analyzed using qualitative content and thematic analytical methods derived from grounded theory and synthesized across six RCTs. ResultsAll six RCTs suffered from poor recruitment. Doctors wanted to gather robust evidence but experienced considerable discomfort and emotion in relation to their clinical instincts and concerns about patient eligibility and safety. Although they relied on a sense of community equipoise to justify participation, most acknowledged having “hunches” about particular treatments and patients, some of which undermined recruitment. Surgeons experienced these issues most intensely. Training and support promoted greater confidence in equipoise and improved <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment.</b> ConclusionRecruitment to RCTs is a fragile process and difficult for doctors intellectually and emotionally. Training and support can enable most doctors to become comfortable with key RCT concepts including equipoise, uncertainty, patient eligibility, and randomization, promoting a more resilient recruitment process in partnership with patients...|$|E
40|$|Through the Australian Defence Force Gap Year {{program and}} the {{preceding}} Ready Reserve scheme, Australian school-leavers {{have had the opportunity}} to experience full-time military training without the obligations of longer-term initial periods of service. This paper analyses these programs, assessing their respective characteristics, identifying both supporters and detractors, and highlighting various challenges. Introduction During the 2013 federal election campaign, the Coalition’s Policy for Stronger Defence contained a pledge to re‑build the ADF Gap Year program. In advocating this initiative, the Coalition argued that the ADF Gap Year ‘has been an effective community <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> tool’ and has ‘proven successful in attracting more women to join the ADF and in bolstering the Army Reserve generally’. Subsequently on 28  April  2014, Assistant Minister for Defence, Stuart Robert, officially launched a reinstated version of the ADF Gap Year program to commence in early 2015. Although the ADF Gap Year was a Howard (Coalition) Government initiative, the concept of giving Australian school-leavers the opportunity for 12 months full-time training in the ADF dates back to the early 1990 s, when the Australian Labor Party (ALP) enacted the Ready Reserve scheme.

40|$|Background: Community {{pharmacy}} (CP) is {{a setting}} with health promotion {{and public health}} potential and could include strategies with a nutrition promotion focus. Research embedded in this setting has explored and produced evidence to inform practice change to develop this potential. The experience of undertaking research in this setting may {{provide insight into the}} challenges and key features of intervention research practice. Exploring experienced-based knowledge presents as a productive area of research, extending what can be known beyond the bounds of what is measurable. Objectives: This study aimed to understand the experience of intervention research in CP with a focus on nutrition and to develop guidance for future research practice (intervention design and implementation) in CP based on interventionist reflections and practice wisdom. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 9 researchers with experience in undertaking intervention research in CP with a nutrition component. Content analysis, constant comparison and interpretive description were used in the analysis and interpretation of interview data. Results: Five key lessons were identified – 1) Utilise existing capacity; 2) Navigate and utilise social power and interests; 3) Personalise <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment,</b> 4) Consider the logistics and 5) Intervention type considerations. Key challenges for translating research into practice and sustaining change included financial sustainability, physical constraints, logistics, collaboration, and practice change enablers. Personal reflections on research practice identified qualities, such as determination and skills in networking, as key for researching in CP. Conclusions: CP-embedded research is challenging given the complexity of the practice environment. The social context of CP appears central to intervention research and a nuanced understanding of the social context needs to be the basis for intervention design to inform successful implementation. Experience-based and insider knowledge is useful and needed for nuanced design and development of intervention research in CP...|$|E
40|$|Background: In the UK {{care homes}} {{are one of}} the main {{providers}} of long term care for older people with dementia. Despite the recent increase in care home research, residents with dementia are often excluded (Gordon et al, 2012). Networks of research enabled care homes may increase recruitment of people with dementia (MAGDR, 2009). Internationally, comparable networks of nursing homes focus on education and training. The ENRICH research network is an England wide initiative to promote care home participation in research. Methods: The ENRICH care home network was piloted in four regions of England. An evaluation was commissioned {{to assess the impact of}} the networks and describe the implementation process. A mixed method approach was used: ???Phase 1 mapped current care home involvement in research across England using online searches, interviews with researchers and care home staff ???Phase 2 evaluated the impact of the networks on recruitment to studies, staff <b>engagement,</b> <b>and</b> costs. Results: Thirty three out of 42 research studies identified were confirmed as including care homes (January 2011 to June 2012). Their research focus, methods and numbers varied considerably. Care homes were recruited to the research networks through corporate <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> individual invitation. <b>Recruitment</b> costs were calculated for individual networks. Care home managers were keen to be involved in research, especially if it provided support for staff or direct benefits for residents.

40|$|T cell {{receptor}} (TCR) <b>engagement</b> induces clustering <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> to the plasma membrane of many signaling molecules, including the protein tyrosine kinase zeta-chain associated protein of 70 kDa (ZAP 70) and the adaptor SH 2 domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP 76). This molecular rearrangement results in {{formation of the}} immunological synapse (IS), a dynamic protein array that modulates T cell activation. The current study investigates the effects of apparent long-range ligand mobility on T cell signaling activity and IS formation. We formed stimulatory lipid bilayers on glass surfaces from binary lipid mixtures with varied composition, and characterized these surfaces with respect to diffusion coefficient and fluid connectivity. Stimulatory ligands coupled to these surfaces with similar density and orientation showed differences {{in their ability to}} activate T cells. On less mobile membranes, central supramolecular activation cluster (cSMAC) formation was delayed and the overall accumulation of CD 3 f at the IS was reduced. Analysis of signaling microcluster (MC) dynamics showed that ZAP 70 MCs exhibited faster track velocity and longer trajectories as a function of increased ligand mobility, whereas movement of SLP 76 MCs was relatively insensitive to this parameter. Actin retrograde flow was observed on all surfaces, but cell spreading and subsequent cytoskeletal contraction were more pronounced on mobile membranes. Finally, increased tyrosine phosphorylation and persistent elevation of intracellular Ca 2 + were observed in cells stimulated on fluid membranes...|$|R
40|$|Latinos are a {{large and}} growing portion of the US {{population}} but are less numerous among participants in politics than their numbers would suggest. Predictions of the future rates of participation among Latinos depend heavily upon understanding the causes of current rates. A substantial proportion of the disparity in participation rates between Latinos and non-Latinos can {{be accounted for by}} the numbers of noncitizens and by other factors related to a large pool of immigrants, differences in socioeconomic resources, and the young age distribution of Latinos. However, these summary statements obscure differences across types of participation. They also obscure differences across Latinos of different national origins. Much of the analysis done to date of the Latino National Political Survey (LNPS) has made clear that Puerto Ricans, Mexican-Americans, and Cuban-Americans can differ as much from each other as members of each group differ from non-Latinos. This paper uses the LNPS data to examine the factors related to different types of political participation among US Latinos of different national origins. Borrowing from the standard participation literature, we consider the impact of resources, <b>engagement,</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment.</b> The Latino population provides an especially useful case for testing hypotheses about the impact of mobilization upon activity. Political leaders have actively appealed to Latino ethnicity both in structuring political competition and in seeking support. I have proposed elsewhere that the success of such appeals in increasing participation will hinge in large part upon whether or not the targeted public believes itself well-represented by the leaders. The LNPS contains several items relevant to perceived representation. This paper will use the LNPS data to test the effect of perceived representation upon political participation, while taking account of the other factors that affect levels of activity...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND : Although {{studies show}} that {{genomics}} and environmental stressors affect blood pressure, {{few studies have examined}} their combined effects, especially in African Americans. OBJECTIVE : We present the recruitment methods and psychological measures of the Intergenerational Impact of Genetic and Psychological Factors on Blood Pressure (InterGEN) study, which seeks to investigate the individual and combined effects of genetic (G) and environmental (E) (psychological) stressors on blood pressure in African American mother-child dyads. Genetic methods are presented elsewhere, but here we present the recruitment methods, psychological measures, and analysis plan for these environmental stressors. METHODS : This longitudinal study will enroll 250 mother-child dyads (N = 500). Study participation is restricted to women who (a) are ≤ 21 years of age, (b) self-identify as African American or Black, (c) speak English, (d) do not have an identified mental illness or cognitive impairment, and (e) have a biological child between 3 and 5 years old. The primary environmental stressors assessed are parenting stress, perceived racism and discrimination, and maternal mental health. Covariates include age, cigarette smoking (for mothers), and gender (for children). The study outcome variables are systolic and diastolic blood pressure. ANALYSIS : The main analytic outcome is genetic-by-environment interaction analyses (G × E); however, main effects (G) and (E) will be individually assessed first. Genetic (G) and interaction analyses (G × E) are described in a companion paper and will include laboratory procedures. Statistical modeling of environmental stressors on blood pressure will be done using descriptive statistics and generalized estimating equation models. IMPLICATIONS : The methodology presented here includes the study rationale, community <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> protocol, psychological variable measurement, and analysis plan for assessing the association of environmental stressors and blood pressure. This study may provide the foundation for other studies and development of interventions to reduce the risk for hypertension and to propose targeted health promotion programs for this high-risk population.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{young people}} report {{they want to}} stop smoking and {{have tried to do}} so, but most of their quit {{attempts}} fail. For adult smokers, there is strong evidence that group behavioural support enhances quit rates. However, it is uncertain whether group behavioural support enhances abstinence in young smokers trying to quit. Findings A cluster randomised trial for young people trying to stop smoking to compare the efficacy of a school-based 9 week intensive group behavioural support course versus a school-based 7 week brief advice only course. Participants were assessed for evidence of tobacco addiction and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) was used if it was deemed appropriate by the therapist. Both types of course aimed to recruit approximately one hundred participants from approximately ten schools. The primary outcome was successful quitting at 4 weeks after quit day judged according to the Russell standard. Had the trial been completed, abstinence at 6 months after quit day and the relationships between successful quit attempts and 1) psychological assessments of dependence prior to quitting 2) salivary cotinine concentration prior to quitting and 3) sociodemographic characteristics would also have been assessed. The proportion of participants who stopped smoking in each arm of the trial were compared using Chi square tests. The trial was stopped shortly after it had started because funding to support the therapists running the stop smoking group behavioural support programme was withdrawn. Only three stop smoking courses were completed (two group support courses and one brief advice pharmacotherapy course). Seventeen participants in total entered the trial. At the end of the courses, one participant (10 %) attending the group support programme had stopped smoking and no participant attending the brief advice programme had stopped smoking. Discussion The trial was stopped so we were unable to determine whether group support helped more young people to stop smoking than brief advice. <b>Engagement</b> <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of participants proved much more difficult than had been anticipated.

A cross-sectional, sequential-explanatory mixed-method design with 4 components: (1) Literature review of selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of newly qualified nurses; and (2) Literature review of a public sector professions’ selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes; (3) Survey mapping existing selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes for newly qualified nurses; and (4) Qualitative study about recruiters’selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> processes. Methods. Literature searches on the selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of newly qualified candidates in teaching and nursing (2005 – 2013) were conducted. Cross-sectional, mixed-method {{data were collected from}} thirty-one (n = 31) individuals in health providers in London who had responsibility for the selection <b>and</b> <b>recruitment</b> of newly qualified nurses using a survey instrument.

40|$|Abstract Background Community-based {{participatory}} research (CBPR) is {{a collaborative}} approach to research {{that involves the}} equitable participation of those affected by an issue. As the field of global public health grows, the potential of CBPR to build capacity and to engage communities in identification of problems and {{development and implementation of}} solutions in sub-Saharan Africa has yet to be fully tapped. The Orphaned and Separated Children’s Assessments Related to their Health and Well-Being (OSCAR) project is a longitudinal cohort of orphaned and non-orphaned children in Kenya. This paper will describe how CBPR approaches and principles can be incorporated and adapted into the study design and methods of a longitudinal epidemiological study in sub-Saharan Africa using this project as an example. Methods The CBPR framework we used involves problem identification, feasibility and planning; implementation; and evaluation and dissemination. This case study will describe how we have engaged the community and adapted CBPR methods to OSCAR’s Health and Well-being Project’s corresponding to this framework in four phases: 1) community <b>engagement,</b> 2) sampling <b>and</b> <b>recruitment,</b> 3) retention, validation, and follow-up, and 4) analysis, interpretation and dissemination. Results To date the study has enrolled 3130 orphaned and separated children, including children living in institutional environments, those living in extended family or other households in the community, and street-involved children <b>and</b> youth. Community <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> participation was integral in refining the study design and identifying research questions that were impacting the community. Through the participation of village Chiefs and elders we were able to successfully identify eligible households and randomize the selection of participants. The on-going contribution of the community in the research process has been vital to participant retention and data validation while ensuring cultural and community relevance and equity in the research agenda. Conclusion CBPR methods have the ability to enable and strengthen epidemiological and public health research in sub-Saharan Africa within the social, political, economic and cultural contexts of the diverse communities on the continent. This project demonstrates that adaptation of these methods is crucial to the successful implementation of a community-based project involving a highly vulnerable population. </p...|$|R
