No one is better than any one else. What an incredible day for California AND for equality." [...] Lovato later said: [...] "I believe in gay marriage, I believe in equality.

The Emperor wrote to his brother-in-law Dom FernandoII, King-consort of Portugal: [...] "By the time you receive this, you will certainly have learnt of the grievous loss I have undergone... God who has made me pass though so hard a testing, will in his mercy give me grounds to console my sorrows." [...] PedroII had already lost another son, Dom Afonso, almost three years earlier. He revealed his inner turmoil in a sonnet: [...] "Twice already I have suffered death, for the father dies who sees his son is dead." [...] Except for brief inspection visits, the Emperor avoided Santa Cruz thereafter.|$|E
500|$|Rivera is {{a devout}} Christian. During his childhood, {{neither he nor}} his family {{attended}} church, but after a born-again experience around the age of 21, Rivera became religious and converted from Catholicism to a Pentecostal faith. His parents followed his lead after seeing the difference it made in him. Rivera believes that God has a reason for everything that happens. For example, he found his failure in Game 7 of the 2001 World Series easier to deal with when he learned of the consequences it had for teammate Enrique Wilson. Had the Yankees won the series, Wilson would have remained in New York for the championship parade and would have departed for his native Dominican Republic on American Airlines Flight 587, which crashed shortly after takeoff and killed all 260 people aboard. Rivera told Wilson, [...] "I am glad we lost the World Series, because it means that <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> friend." [...] Rivera's pitching glove was inscribed [...] "Phil. 4:13", in reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13 ("I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me").|$|E

Sheen stated, [...] "I've decided that my children deserve my focus more than a relationship does right now. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> tremendous fondness for Scotty and I wish her all the best."

[...] Given permission, she selected as the artist a National Guard officer, [...] Jean-Jacques Hauer, who had already begun sketching her from the gallery of the courtroom.

2500|$|Chosen by Empress Dowager Cixi on her deathbed, Puyi became emperor {{at the age}} of 2years and 10months in December1908 {{after the}} Guangxu Emperor died on 14November. Titled the Xuantong Emperor (Wade-Giles: Hsuan-tung Emperor), Puyi's {{introduction}} to the life of an emperor began when palace officials arrived at his family residence to take him. On the evening of 13November 1908, without any advance notice, a procession of eunuchs and guardsmen led by the palace chamberlain left the Forbidden City for the Northern Mansion to inform Prince Chun that they were taking away his three-year-old son Puyi to be the new emperor. The toddler Puyi screamed and resisted as the officials ordered the eunuch attendants to pick him up. Puyi's parents said nothing when they learned that they were losing their son. As Puyi cried, screaming {{that he did not want}} to leave his parents, he was forced into a palanquin that took him back to the Forbidden City. Puyi's wet nurse Wang Wen-Chao was the only person from the Northern Mansion allowed to go with him, and she calmed the very distraught Puyi down by allowing him to suckle one of her breasts; this was the only reason why she was taken along as only she could calm Puyi down. Upon arriving at the Forbidden City, Puyi was taken to see the Dowager Empress Cixi. Puyi later wrote: <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> dim recollection of this meeting, the shock of which left a deep impression on my memory. I remember suddenly finding myself surrounded by strangers, while before me was hung a drab curtain through which I could see an emaciated and terrifying hideous face. This was Cixi. It is said that I burst out into loud howls at the sight and started to tremble uncontrollably. Cixi told someone to give me some sweets, but I threw them on the floor and yelled [...] "I want nanny, I want nanny", to her great displeasure. [...] "What a naughty child" [...] she said. [...] "Take him away to play." [...] His father, Prince Chun, became Prince Regent (摄政王). During Puyi's coronation in the Hall of Supreme Harmony on 2December 1908, the young emperor was carried onto the Dragon Throne by his father. Puyi was so frightened by the scene before him and the deafening sounds of ceremonial drums and music that he started crying. His father could do nothing except to quietly comfort him: [...] "Don't cry, it'll be over soon." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 6, 1862 Fagan's brigade {{arrived at}} Morrow’s and {{controlled}} all the approaches to Cane Hill {{from the south}} and east. Hindman then learned of the approach of General Herron, who had two divisions just north of Fayetteville. Hindman planned to get behind the Federal division of General Blunt and prevent General Herron’s division from combining with Gen. Blunt. Upon reaching the high ground at Prairie Grove on December 7, Hindman’ s army formed on ridge overlooking Crawford Prairie and Fagan's brigade was advanced to a position fifty yards from the Borden Orchard. The position was very good and there the army waited for Herron to advance. Brook’s regiment was posted behind an artillery battery. Around 2:00 pm the artillery duel started. Blocher’s Battery, which was part of Fagan's brigade became a lightning rod for Federal artillery and later infantry. The 20th Wisconsin advanced to take the battery and when their right flank was 50 yards away from their Brook’s 34th Arkansas rose and fired into them. The regiment was ordered forward along with Chew’s Arkansas Infantry Battalion and Hawthorne’s regiment. The 20th Wisconsin was driven back and the battery was retaken. As the Confederate counterattack came off the ridge and onto the prairie they came under heavy fire and retreated to their position in the ravine. As the Confederates were reorganizing another Federal attack was launched. This time the 37th Illinois advanced to the summit. Again the Fagan's brigade rose out of the scrub and fired a point blank volley and charged. The two forces locked in hand-to-hand fighting. Again the Confederates followed the retreating Federals and ran into heavy fire. As the brigade resumed their position on the summit, the tempo of the battle slowed and shifted {{to another part of the}} battlefield. They stayed in position until nearly midnight when the order to retreat came. During the march over the Boston Mountains many of the men deserted to their homes. In April 1862, Colonel King wrote home to his mother and had this to say about the regiment, [...] "The fight at Prairie Grove notwithstanding. We whipped it proved to be a very disastrous one to us. My loss in the fight was a very heavy one. I lost one hundred and thirty two men, killed and wounded out of less than five hundred men. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fine Regt. and am ready for another fight.
