5|$|A {{group of}} {{volunteer}} citizens in London's East End called the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee patrolled the streets looking for suspicious characters, {{partly because of}} dissatisfaction with the police effort. They petitioned the government to raise a reward <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> killer, and hired private detectives to question witnesses independently.|$|E
5|$|During {{the hearing}} into the gunfight at the O.K.

Wyatt testified that he had other motives for his plan, as well; he hoped that arresting the murderers would boost his chances for {{election}} as Cochise County sheriff. Wyatt told the court {{that he had taken}} the extra step of obtaining a second copy of a telegram for Ike from Wells Fargo assuring that the reward for capturing the killers applied either dead or alive.|$|E
5|$|On 12 July Ward {{reported}} on the weekend's events to MI5. He told Woods that Ivanov and Profumo had met and that the latter had shown considerable interest in Keeler. Ward also stated {{that he had been}} asked by Ivanov <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> future arming of West Germany with atomic weapons. This request for military information did not greatly disturb MI5, who expected a GRU officer to ask such questions. Profumo's interest in Keeler was an unwelcome complication in their plans to use her in a honey trap operation against Ivanov, to help secure his defection. Woods therefore referred the issue to MI5's director-general, Sir Roger Hollis.|$|E

5|$|Poetry {{is often}} {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone.

5|$|The Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) website, {{one of the}} top global {{earthquake}} information website {{experienced a}} massive and immediate traffic surge caused by the convergence of eyewitnesses looking <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> shaking. Their hit times proved to mimic the seismic wave propagation generated by the earthquake. On average eyewitnesses hit the website 90s after the ground start shaking. The epicenter was determined with 30km by retropagating 2 min of EMSC website traffic without using any seismic data. The authors argue that eyewitnesses can be considered as real time sensor, their website visit being triggerred by the ground shaking.|$|E
5|$|The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) is an Australian {{government}} agency {{which was established}} on 30 March 2014 to coordinate search and recovery operations for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, which disappeared on 8 March 2014 and was soon thereafter determined to have ended in the Southern Indian Ocean, within Australia's concurrent aeronautical and maritime search and rescue regions. The JACC is an agency within Australia's Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development, headed by Judith Zielke. It does not perform any search, recovery, or investigation activities, but coordinates the search effort {{and serves as a}} primary point of contact <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> search for media and families of Flight 370 passengers.|$|E

5|$|The {{first chapter}} of the Upanishad opens as a {{conversation}} between Brihaspati and Yajnavalkya, where Brihaspati asks Yajnavalkya <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> place where the seat of all beings, the Brahman, lives. Yajnavalkya states that true Brahman-seat of all beings, or Kurukshetra, is Avimuktam – a place that Shiva never left. This Avimuktam {{is a part of}} Varanasi (Banaras). All renouncers, after having wandered places, should stay at this Avimuktam. This is the place, asserts the Upanishad, where Rudra imparts the moksha knowledge just when the last vital breaths of the dying are departing, leading one to videhamukti (salvation after death). This place is holy, a place to revere and not leave.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{also had}} correspondents who {{supplied}} him with material. Albinus, the abbot {{of the monastery}} in Canterbury, provided much information about the church in Kent, and {{with the assistance of}} Nothhelm, at that time a priest in London, obtained copies of Gregory the Great's correspondence from Rome relating to Augustine's mission. Almost all of Bede's information regarding Augustine is taken from these letters. Bede acknowledged his correspondents in the preface to the Historia Ecclesiastica; he was in contact with Daniel, the Bishop of Winchester, <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> history of the church in Wessex, and also wrote to the monastery at Lastingham for information about Cedd and Chad. Bede also mentions an Abbot Esi as a source for the affairs of the East Anglian church, and Bishop Cynibert for information about Lindsey.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC distribution system.|$|E

5|$|Other {{types of}} {{religious}} texts give {{evidence for the}} myth, such as two Middle Kingdom texts: the Dramatic Ramesseum Papyrus and the Ikhernofret Stela. The papyrus describes the coronation of Senusret I, whereas the stela alludes to events in the annual festival of Khoiak. Rituals in both these festivals reenacted elements of the Osiris myth. The most complete ancient Egyptian account of the myth is the Great Hymn to Osiris, an inscription from the Eighteenth Dynasty (c. 1550–1292 BCE) that gives the general outline of the entire story but includes little detail. Another important source is the Memphite Theology, a religious narrative that includes an account of Osiris's death {{as well as the}} resolution of the dispute between Horus and Set. This narrative associates the kingship that Osiris and Horus represent with Ptah, the creator deity of Memphis. The text was long thought to date back to the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181 BCE) and was treated as a source <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> early stages {{in the development of the}} myth. Since the 1970s, however, Egyptologists have concluded that the text dates to the New Kingdom at the earliest.|$|E
5|$|The Forerunner Saga reveals Guilty Spark to {{have barely}} survived {{the events of}} Halo 3. His body barely {{functioning}} and his memory {{of the last few}} years erased from his fight with Chief, he was recovered by the UNSC ship Rubicon and interrogated by ONI <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Forerunners. During the interrogation, the barely functioning Spark had breached the Rubicon's firewalls and overpowered the onboard A.I. When the interrogation was over, his monitor body shut down and was launched into space, but his mind remained in the ship, informing the crew {{that he was going to}} search for the Librarian and restore his friends Riser and Vinnerva from his life as Chakas before placing the crew in cryostasis and taking the ship for his own to search for the Forerunner.|$|E
5|$|The {{diet and}} {{physiology}} of Edmontosaurus have been probed by using stable isotopes of carbon and oxygen as recorded in tooth enamel. When feeding, drinking, and breathing, animals take in carbon and oxygen, which become incorporated into bone. The isotopes {{of these two}} elements are determined by various internal and external factors, such as the type of plants being eaten, the physiology of the animal, salinity, and climate. If isotope ratios in fossils are not altered by fossilization and later changes, they can be studied <b>for</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> original factors; warmblooded animals will have certain isotopic compositions compared to their surroundings, animals that eat certain types of plants or use certain digestive processes will have distinct isotopic compositions, and so on. Enamel is typically used because {{the structure of the}} mineral that forms enamel makes it the most resistant material to chemical change in the skeleton.|$|E
