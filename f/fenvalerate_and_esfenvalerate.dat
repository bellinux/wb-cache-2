40|$|This section method (SM) {{documents}} {{a selective}} pyrethroid analysis in sediment water and {{is followed by}} all authorized EMON personnel. This method uses the triple quadrupole to improve sensitivity and enables the lowering of the reporting limit over the previous method which used the ECD and MSD. 2. Principle: The SM describes the method for determination of resmethrin, bifenthrin, fenpropathrin, lambda cyhalothrin epimer, lambda cyhalothrin, permethin cis, permethrin trans, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, <b>fenvalerate</b> / <b>esfenvalerate</b> <b>and</b> deltamethrin in sediment water. The pyrethroids are extracted from the sediment water using liquid-liquid extraction with hexane. The extracts are concentrated and then cleaned up with florisil before being analyzed with a gas chromatography equipped with triple quadrupole detector. The reporting limit is 10 ppt for resmethrin, 2 ppt for bifenthrin and 5 ppt for {{all the rest of}} the compounds. 3. Safety: 3. 1 All general laboratory safety rules for sample preparation and analysis shall be followed. 3. 2 Hexane is a flammable and toxic solvent; it should be handled with care in a ventilated area. 4.

40|$|Aim: Evaluation of {{combined}} {{effect of}} <b>fenvalerate</b> <b>and</b> nitrate on biochemical parameters in buffalo calves. Materials and Methods: Sixteen male buffalo calves {{were divided into}} four groups of four calves each. Group I receiving no treatment served as the control. Group II and III animals were orally administered with fenvalerate (1. 0 mg/kg/day) and sodium nitrate (20 mg/kg/day), respectively, for 21 consecutive days and were kept as positive control. Group IV animals were co-administered with <b>fenvalerate</b> <b>and</b> sodium nitrate at the above dose rates for 21 consecutive days. Biochemical parameters including Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Glucose, Total protein, Albumin, Cholesterol, Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and Creatinine were determined on 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 17 and 21 day of treatment. Estimation of these parameters was also done on 7 th day of post-treatment period. Results: Co-administration of <b>fenvalerate</b> <b>and</b> sodium nitrate produced {{significant increase in the}} plasma levels of AST, ALP, GGT, LDH, glucose, BUN, cholesterol and creatinine while significant decrease in the plasma levels of total proteins was observed. No significant alteration was observed in albumin levels.

A significant reduction in the resistance ratio for each compound was observed in UNSEL at G, 1, indicating that the observed resistance to each insecticide was unstable.

To further investigate a promising alternative to the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO), we compared the synergistic effects of PBO and Piper aduncum L. essential oil (PAEO) when combined with several insecticides (cypermethrin, zeta-cypermethrin, permethrin, <b>and</b> <b>esfenvalerate)</b> on the larvae of Spodoptera frugiperda (J.

Initially, we determined the lethal doses and concentrations (LD 50 and LC 50) for S. frugiperda larvae subjected to separate treatments with PAEO and with each commercial insecticide. Subsequently, in order to evaluate the synergistic effect, combinations of sublethal doses or sublethal concentrations of the essential oil (½ and ¼ of the LD 50 or LC 50, respectively) were prepared with sublethal doses or sublethal concentrations of the insecticides (below the LD 40 or LC 40).

40|$|Due to {{extensive}} use, {{human exposure}} to multiple pyrethroid insecticides occurs frequently. Studies of pyrethroid neurotoxicity suggest a common mode of toxicity and that pyrethroids {{should be considered}} cumulatively to model risk. The objective of this work was to use a pyrethroid mixture that reflects human expo-sure to common pyrethroids to develop comparative toxicokinetic profiles in rats, and then model the relationship between brain concentration and motor activity. Data from {{a national survey of}} child care centers were used to make a mixture reflecting propor-tions of the most prevalent pyrethroids: permethrin, cyperme-thrin, β-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, <b>and</b> <b>esfenvalerate.</b> The mixture was administered orally at one of two concentrations (11. 2 and 27. 4 mg/kg) to adult male rats. At intervals from 1 to 24 h, motor activity was assessed and the animals were sacrificed. Pyrethroi...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{fenvalerate}} on rat cerebral cortex and cerebellum cell membrane fluidity were investigated using a fluorescence polarization technique. The study {{was performed in}} vitro and in vivo, producing different data according to the experimental conditions. In vitro, fenvalerate induced a significant concentration-dependent increase in membrane fluidity in both brain regions; in vivo the authors observed that membrane fluidity increased in a dose and time dependent manner in the cerebellum cells of rats treated with fenvalerate for 2, 5 or 30 days, whilst no change was found in cerebral cortex cells. This latter result {{could be explained by}} the increasing accumulation of <b>fenvalerate</b> <b>and</b> its metabolites in the cerebellum where the levels of conjugation activity appear to be very low...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of insecticide residues in cereals represents a {{risk for the}} consumer, because these substances are used in large scale to protect stored grains from the attack of pests. The effects of three processing methods for corn and wheat samples on the stability of stored-grain protective insecticides were here evaluated. Fenitrothion <b>and</b> <b>esfenvalerate</b> were applied so as to produce theoretical concentrations of 10 and 0. 5 mg kg- 1, respectively. Two hours after treatment, the grains were processed and deposition was analyzed by gas chromatography. Grain species did not influence insecticide stability. This stability was only dependent upon the processing method and insecticide type. Grains processed together with dry ice provided the greatest percentage of recovery for both insecticides. Regardless of the processing method, more esfenvalerate than fenitrothion was recovered, thus demonstrating the greater stability of the pyrethroid during this operation...|$|R
40|$|The {{status of}} {{insecticide}} resistance in some fi eld populations of Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) {{from the main}} cotton growing regions of central and south India was determined during the cropping seasons of 2001 - 2005. Seven insecticides viz. endosulfan, methomyl, monocrotophos, quinalphos, chlorpyriphos, <b>fenvalerate</b> <b>and</b> cypermethrin were tested against second-, third- and fi fth-instar Helicoverpa armigera larvae. Dose-mortality regressions, LD 50 s and their fi ducial limits were computed by probit analysis. Resistance factors (RF) were estimated at the LD 50 level as RF=LD 50 fi eld strain/LD 50 susceptible strain. The Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) exhibited widespread resistance (RF= 48 - 919) to cypermethrin. Insecticide resistance to chlorpyriphos was low to moderate {{in the majority of}} the strains tested. A substantial inter-strain variation in insecticide resistance was evident...|$|R
