Results: In isolated guinea-pig tracheal segments, crude extract of Acorus calamus was more effective than carbachol in causing relaxation of high K(+) (80 mM) precontractions, similar to verapamil, suggesting blockade of calcium channels. The n-hexane fraction was equipotent against both precontractions, similar to papaverine, while <b>ethylacetate</b> fraction was more potent against carbachol precontractions but had a negligible dilator effect against K(+), similar to atropine and or rolipram. Pretreatment of tracheal preparations with n-hexane or <b>ethylacetate</b> fractions potentiated isoprenaline-induced inhibitory concentration-response curves, similar to papaverine or rolipram. Pretreatment of tracheal preparations with <b>ethylacetate</b> fraction caused a rightward parallel shift in carbachol response curve at lower concentration (0. 003 mg/mL) similar to atropine and a non-parallel shift at higher concentrations (0. 01 mg/mL), with reduction of maximum response, similar to rolipram.
