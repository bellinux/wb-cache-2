In December 2011, Croatia completed the EU accession negotiations and signed an EU accession treaty on 9 December 2011. Croatia joined the European Union on 1 July 2013 marking {{the end of a}} process started in 2001 by signing of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement and Croatian application for the EU membership in 2003. A recurring obstacle to the negotiations was Croatia's ICTY co-operation record and Slovenian blocking of the negotiations because of Croatia–Slovenia border disputes. The latter was resolved through an Arbitration Agreement of 4 November 2009, approved by national parliaments and a referendum in Slovenia.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis essay {{seeks to}} {{identify}} and assess the general shift in Russian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> thinking during Vladimir Putin’s presidency. The main thesis of this essay is that a general shift in Russian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>had</b> occurred during Putin’s presidency owing to the rise in Statist thinking. To substantiate the thesis, the author uses the State of the Nation addresses of Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin to make a comparative analysis of the presidents’ <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> approaches. As demonstrated in the essay, the Russian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> <b>had</b> experienced a dramatic influx of state power during Vladimir Putin’s presidency, {{which resulted in the}} relative quantitative and qualitative reduction of cooperative initiatives between the United States and Russia...|$|R

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{domestic}} and international political changes, French and German <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> <b>have</b> displayed high degrees of continuity between the late 1950 s and the mid- 1990 s.

Why do states similar in many respects often part ways in {{what they want and}} do? This article argues that the French and German national role conceptions (NRCs) account for both of these continuities. NRCs are domestically shared understandings regarding the proper role and purpose of one’s own state as a social collectivity in the international arena. As internal reference systems, they affect national interests and <b>foreign</b> <b>policies.</b> This article reestablishes the NRC concept, empirically codes it for France and Germany for the time period under consideration, and demonstrates comparatively how different NRCs lead to varying interests and policies across the major policy areas in security, defense, and armament...|$|R
