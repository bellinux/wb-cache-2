5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and <b>go</b> <b>through</b> a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs <b>go</b> <b>through</b> four moulting stages and nymphs <b>go</b> <b>through</b> three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers <b>go</b> <b>through</b> further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E

5|$|A {{railroad}} {{was being}} built {{and the population}} of Quorn hoped that it would <b>go</b> <b>through</b> the village {{on its way to}} Sioux City, Iowa. However, the railroad did not <b>go</b> <b>through</b> Quorn. One of the many ideas about why the railroad took a different route was due to a disagreement between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and the Close brothers. The actual reason is still unknown. Due to the railroad being the main mode of transportation of goods, the villagers {{had no choice but to}} relocate to a new area. Every business except for a mill was moved to a new area during 1883.|$|E

The ghetto police then searched Weisskopf's house, found contraband, arrested him, and jailed him for four days, after which he lost his position running the workshop.|$|E
