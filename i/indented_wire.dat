40|$|The {{application}} of cable bolts for ground support is increasing in underground coal mines worldwide. Currently, two methods of evaluating {{the performance of}} the cable bolt are favoured: the short encapsulation pull test, and the shear test. The former method can be used both in the laboratory and in the field while the latter can be undertaken mainly in the laboratory. There are two methods of shear strength testing: single and double shear tests. This paper examines the double shear testing of several cable bolts currently marketed in Australia under various pre-tension stresses. Both plain and <b>indented</b> <b>wire</b> cable bolts were tested. It was found that the shear strength of the cable bolt was a function of the wire geometry and initial pre-tension. <b>Indented</b> <b>wire</b> cable bolts were lower in shear strength than the plain wire cable bolts. A mathematical model was proposed to evaluate the shear strength of cable bolts using Fourier series and a linear relationship between shear and normal loads. The model coefficients were determined based on the experimental results. The findings from the mathematical modelling tallied well with the experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Testing of {{axial load}} {{transfer}} of various Australian cable bolts {{has been conducted}} in overseas laboratories within {{the last two years}} (Thomas, 2012). The comparative laboratory testing determined that nutcaged cables and <b>indented</b> <b>wire</b> cables provide stiffer and higher capacity bond strength compared to plain cable. Laboratory studies have limitations in terms of rock strength and installation practice but have the benefit of controlling the type of load applied during the test. In situ cable bolt tests were conducted underground using common installation equipment, resin capsules instead of cementitious grout where relevant, and in a typical coal mine roof. In situ testing methods included anti-twist methodology similar to that used in laboratory tests...|$|E
40|$|Sixteen single shear {{tests were}} carried out on eight {{geometric}} cable variations provided for testing from Australian suppliers – Jennmar, Megabolt and Minova. Each test was subjected to varying pre-tension values of zero and 15 tonnes, exploring the effect of plain, spiral, bulbed, indented and a combination of plain and <b>indented</b> <b>wire</b> strands. The results obtained demonstrated that the shear strength of plain strand cable was higher than the spiral and/or indented profiled cables with direct correlation to the strands ultimate tensile strength. All the plain profiled cables experienced an element of partial debonding suggesting that their application at embedment length less than 1. 8 m each anchor side may not be adequate. The spiral and indented profile strands provided greater bond strength at the cable-grout interface due to the surface roughness of the wires imposing an interlocking effect, leading to reduced shear displacement. The data suggests that the spiral profile was superior to the indented profile due possibly to the compromised integrity of the strand from the impact of stress raisers when creating the indented profile. No study was carried on the button indented profile cable bolts. This report is the first validation that type of apparatus selected to test the shearing capacity of a cable strand will not affect results...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical procedure for bond between <b>indented</b> <b>wires</b> and concrete, and the coupled splitting {{process of the}} surrounding concrete. The bond model is an interface, non-associative, plasticity model. It is coupled with a cohesive fracture model for concrete {{to take into account}} the splitting of such concrete. Bond between steel and concrete is fundamental for the transmission of stresses between both materials in precast prestressed concrete. <b>Indented</b> <b>wires</b> are used to improve the bond in these structural elements. The radial component of the prestressing force, increased by Poisson's effect, may split the surrounding concrete, decreasing the wire confinement and diminishing the bonding. The combined action of the bond and the splitting is studied with the proposed model. The results of the numerical model are compared with the results of a series of tests, such as those which showed splitting induced by the bond between wire and concrete. Tests with different steel indentation depths were performed. The numerical procedure accurately reproduces the experimental records and improves knowledge of this complex proces...|$|R

40|$|CFETR, “China Fusion Engineering Test Reactor,” {{is a new}} tokamak device. Its magnet system {{includes}} the toroidal field (TF), central solenoid (CS), and poloidal field coils. The main goal of this project {{is to build a}} fusion engineering tokamak reactor with fusion power of 50 - 200 MW and self-sufficiency by blanket. The maximum field of CS and TF will get around 16 T, which is much higher than that of other reactors. New materials could be used to develop the technology of magnet {{for the next generation of}} fusion reactors. Bi 2 Sr 2 CaCu 2 Ox as a potential material is considered. However, the Bi- 2212 phase is brittle, and the sheath of the round wire (RW) is Ag/Ag-Mg alloy with high plasticity and low strength. During cabling or conductor manufacturing, the compression on wire is inevitable, which could cause severe indentation on wire. With the aim of investigating the impact of indentations on the critical current of Bi- 2212, the artificially <b>indented</b> <b>wires</b> were made, and Ic was measured. The results show that Ic of a Bi- 2212 RW, unlike Nb 3 Sn and NbTi wires, linearly decreased by the increased depth of indentation. The results are foreseen to be useful for Bi- 2212 conductor design and manufacturing...|$|R

An empirical {{investigation into}} the transfer of prestress force from wire tendons to concrete in the end zones of pretensioned prestressed concrete beams was accomplished in this project. The experimental tests featured 56 small scale prestressed concrete beams. Some of the factors influencing prestress transfer which were considered in the current tests are as follows:(a) type of release - gradual, sudden or shock(b) surface condition of the wire - plain or indented(c) size of the wire(d) concrete compressive strength {{at the time of}} transfer(e) time dependent effectsMost of the tests involved gradual release of steel tendons with the prestressing force transferred in approximately ten equal increments. Sudden release in a single step was achieved by allowing the supporting abutments to retract rapidly. Shock release was implemented in some beams by angle grinding the wires. The type of release which gave the best quality of prestress transfer was gradual release. This was followed by sudden and shock releases respectively. There were four types of wires used in the laboratory tests: namely the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron indented, 7 mm dia. Plain and 7 mm dia. Belgian indented wires. Transmission lengths were determined from strain distributions for these wires. Pull-ins of the wire tendons at the ends of the beams were also measured. There was significant scatter in the experimental data. Different ranges of transmission lengths and pull-ins were obtained for the various types of wires used. Three equations were derived for the 5 mm dia. Plain, 5 mm dia. Chevron and 7 mm dia. Plain wires, which linearly correlated pull-ins to the transmission lengths. ++These relationships provide a qualitative and quantitative method of indirectly monitoring for the transmission lengths through the measurements of pull-in. Statistical inference tests proved that indented wires were superior in performance compared to plain wires, but the differences were more apparent for the pull-ins than for the transmission lengths. Comparisons on the influence of tendon size substantiated that greater pull-ins occurred for larger wires but the differences were not significant for the transmission lengths. For concrete strength at the time of transfer of less than 32 MPa, the transmission lengths and pull-ins were significantly larger than those for higher strengths. It is recommended that concrete strength at transfer be at least 32 MPa for pretensioned prestressed concrete. Apart from the maturity and strength of concrete, the quality of a mix also influenced the transmission length and there was limited data to suggest that a better grade mix despite having lower strength at a more tender age could outperform a lower grade mix with greater strength released after a longer curing period. Formulae for plain and indented wires were found by dimensional analysis which correlated the transmission length to the diameter of wire tendon and the stress/strength ratio of the prestressed beams. Pull-ins increased significantly over 6 months but the changes in the transmission lengths were small. Normalised longitudinal strain distributions did not indicate that transmission lengths would remain unchanged over time...|$|E
40|$|Bolting is {{currently}} the most commonly accepted rock reinforcing method of dealing with rock strata instability in both surface and underground mines as well as civil engineering. Bolts are installed in fractured rock mass to build composite beams in weak strata or to attach weak excavation surfaces to deeper and competent rock layers to achieve stability. After opening, rock mass around the excavation space experiences stress redistribution and rock fracturing occurs in this process. Bolts installed in the fractured rock mass around excavations normally bear combined tensile and shear loads due to the opening and sliding of rock fractures. Direct shear restraint and high normal stress are applied by the bolt to the fracture surfaces to minimise their displacements. This mechanism allows the excavation surfaces to stabilise and makes them self-supporting. In the interactive process of rock mass and bolt, two load transfer mechanisms are involved: the axial tensioning (axial shearing at the bolt-grout interface, in essence) and the lateral shearing. Axial tensioning was the common focus in past studies, whereas lateral shearing is attracting more attention at present. The strength of the bolt when subjected to both shear and tensile loads is smaller than bolt strength when subjected to tensile load only. Thus, ignoring the shear load in bolting design probably leads to a higher safety factor. Hence, a deep understanding of bolt behaviour subjected to combined loads is essential in bolting system design and assessment. In the past, a number of experimental and theoretical investigations were conducted on the shear behaviour of the rock discontinuity reinforced by rock bolts and a few preliminary conclusions were drawn. Yet, few studies were performed on the shear behaviour of cable bolted rock discontinuities. Thus, this research investigated the shear performance of cable bolted rock discontinuities both experimentally and theoretically to provide more knowledge in this area. A series of experimental studies were undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour of cable bolted concrete joints (representing rock discontinuity) and relevant influencing factors. Double shear tests with joint friction were carried out and test results were analysed in respect of joint shear strength, joint shear displacement, joint shear stiffness, cable pre-tension effect, cable wire surface profile effect, cable failure mode and the shear force-axial force relationship. Double shear tests without joint friction were also carried out using a modified double shear test apparatus. By comparing the double shear tests with and without joint friction, the joint friction and the cable dowel effects on the shear behaviour of cabled concrete joints were studied. British standard single shear tests were also carried out on four cable bolts and were compared with double shear tests. The comparison showed that the joint shear strength from the British standard single shear tests was {{much smaller than the}} double shear test results and the reason was analysed. Bolts used in underground rock engineering include Fibre Glass (FG) bolts, steel rebar bolts and cable bolts. Since these three types of bolts have different mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, shear strength and axial tensile modulus, their reinforcing effect on rock discontinuities are expected to be different. Thus in this study, cable bolts were compared with FG bolts and steel rebar bolts in terms of reinforcing concrete joints with consideration of their basic mechanical properties. Comparison showed that the influence of their basic mechanical properties on their reinforcing effect on concrete joints was evident. Since the mechanical properties of FG bolts was completely different from the other two types, the FG bolt reinforcing effect on the concrete joint was entirely different. The reinforcing effect of cable bolts and steel rebar bolts was more similar due to their similar mechanical properties. Apart from the experimental investigations, an analytical study was also carried out based on the statically indeterminate beam theory and some conclusions drawn from existing test results, with consideration of most pertinent influencing factors. An analytical model was proposed and compared with the double shear test results, which showed close agreement. In the light of the proposed theoretical method, parametric investigations were performed on four influencing factors, including cable pre-tension, joint friction coefficient, concrete strength and cable installation angle. From the parametric investigations, it was known that the joint friction coefficient and the concrete strength influenced the cable bolted joint shear strength in a consistent manner. However, the cable pre-tension and the cable installation angle affected the cabled joint shear strength in an inconsistent manner. In addition, the cable pre-tension showed opposite influences on cabled joint shear strength when changing the cable failure modulus, which was consistent with the double shear tests on the plain wire cable and the <b>indented</b> <b>wire</b> cable...|$|E
40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} railroad {{ties are}} becoming increasingly popular in the United States, and are an essential component for higher speed railway lines. In order for these prestressed concrete ties to function adequately over their expected service life, the prestressing force must be fully introduced into the railroad tie at a location well before the rail load is applied. The length required to transfer the prestress force into the concrete member {{is referred to as}} the “Transfer Length. ” Since the prestressed concrete ties are relatively short, and have extremely large impact loads applied near the member ends, most of the prestressed concrete railroad tie producers utilize <b>indented</b> prestressing <b>wires</b> or <b>indented</b> prestressing strands rather than traditional 7 -wire smooth prestressing strands. It is generally understood that these indentations serve to improve the bond between the steel and the concrete and therefore reduce the transfer length. However, because the broad application of these indented reinforcing steels has been so limited, current design codes in the United States do not yet address <b>indented</b> prestressing <b>wire</b> or <b>indented</b> strands in terms of recommended design assumptions for transfer and development length. Moreover, there is currently not even a standardized indentation pattern (shape, size, depth of indent, etc.) that is utilized by all wire manufacturers. Thus, the corresponding bond behavior of these different wires when placed i...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, nanomechanical {{properties}} of trench template–fabricated indium nanowires have been measured by directly <b>indenting</b> the <b>wires.</b> It is observed that elastic modulus and hardness were found be less for indium wires than indium continuous films. It is found from the creep studies {{that in the}} case of nanowires, onset of dislocation creep phenomena occurs at very low loads. Hardness and modulus of indium micro/nanowires decrease with the decrease in wire diameter. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the mechanical {{properties of}} indium nanowires fabricated by trench template method and using nanoindentation technique.|$|R
30|$|The {{indenter}} tip {{was used}} to image and locate indium nanowires and then in situ <b>indent</b> on the <b>wire</b> with the same tip. Extreme care should be taken {{at this point to}} avoid tip break/damage. Post-indent impression was captured using the same tip. Post-test imaging provides the ability to verify that the test was performed in the desired location, which improves the reliability of the data and aids in the explanation of unexpected test results. To avoid thermal drift effects, sufficient time (3 – 4 h) has been provided to system after switching on the machine to achieve thermal equilibrium conditions. The machine allows shallow penetration depths (~ 5 nm) because it is inherently a load control instrument with its extremely low noise floor.|$|R
30|$|Figure 1 c {{shows the}} AFM {{image of the}} indent on the flat wire of {{diameter}} 2000 nm and the total height of 100 – 180 nm. Figure 1 d shows the line profile of the indented impression. Figure 1 e is a coloured 3 D image for the residual indent impression on the same nanowire shown in Fig. 1 c. The peak nanoindentation depth can be as low as 50 nm (for 500 nm dia wire), which is about 10 % of the wire diameter. In our case of experimentation, height of nanowire/microwire {{is found to be}} 100 – 180 nm which is in safe zone. In general, the depth of indentation should not cross more than 10 % of the film/wire thickness to avoid substrate effects in the hardness/modulus data. The same Berkovich tip was used to perform indentation test as well as for imaging after indentation. <b>Indenting</b> on a <b>wire</b> kind of structures is a bit difficult because under high load, wire can move/roll on the substrate surface hence indenter slips. Slipping of the indentation tip onto the wire top surface has been tried to avoid by placing indenter tip just midway {{on the top of the}} nano/microwire. In the present case, the adhesion forces between the wires and quartz substrate are strong enough to avoid wire from moving/rolling on the substrate. Interestingly, no cracking or chipping was observed and only some pile-up observed on either side of the residual indent in the nanowires case. But under the same load, indium film did not show any pile-up effects. However, the pile-up height is very less in the wire case. Pile-up correction has been done to the hardness and modulus data obtained from Oliver–Pharr method. Depending upon strain hardening of the tested material, the surface deformation mode of an indent can be pile-up or sink-in. In low strain-hardening materials, pile-up tends to occur due to incompressible plastic deformation. The opposite is true for high strain-hardening materials [31]. From the above analysis, it is clear that nanowire exhibits more plastic-like behaviour. Additionally, the indenter has penetrated up to the substrate surface at higher loads, but there was no sign of radial crack formation of the film/wire. It means that indium wires are in good adhesion towards the substrate. To confirm the values of indentation hardness calculated from Oliver–Pharr method, we have calculated hardness using indentation projected area obtained from residual indent in the AFM image. Indentation-projected area calibration eliminates the wire curvature effects on the mechanical properties. Both the methods have resulted different values of hardness.|$|R
