25|$|Performance {{related to}} hard-disk access is also {{slightly}} slower on a Wubi install, more {{so if the}} underlying <b>disk</b> <b>image</b> file is fragmented, as the <b>disk</b> <b>image</b> file in the Windows filesystem contains a Linux filesystem whereas without Wubi only the Linux filesystem is used that has direct hardware access.|$|E
40|$|Testing digital {{forensic}} tools {{is important}} to determine relevant tool properties like effectiveness and efficiency. Since many different forensic tool categories exist, different testing techniques and especially suitable test data are required. Considering test data for disk analysis and data recovery tools, synthetic <b>disk</b> <b>images</b> provide significant advantages compared to <b>disk</b> <b>images</b> created from real-world storage devices. In this work we propose a framework for generating synthetic <b>disk</b> <b>images</b> for testing digital forensic analysis tools. The framework provides functionality for building models of real-world scenarios in which data on a storage device like a hard disk is created, changed, or deleted. Using such a model our framework allows simulating actions specified in the model in order to generate synthetic <b>disk</b> <b>images</b> with realistic characteristics. These <b>disk</b> <b>images</b> can then be used for testing the performance of forensic disk analysis and data recovery tools...|$|R

The uraeus is a logical symbol for this dangerous power. [...] In art, the sun <b>disk</b> <b>image</b> often incorporates one or two uraei coiled around it. The solar uraeus represents the Eye as a dangerous force that encircles the sun god and guards against his enemies, spitting flames like venom. Four uraei are sometimes said to surround Ra's barque.

500|$|The {{need for}} such {{software}} was first recognized in 1989 at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, resulting {{in the creation of}} IMDUMP (by Michael White) and in 1990, SafeBack (developed by Sydex). Similar software was developed in other countries; DIBS (a hardware and software solution) was released commercially in the UK in 1991, and Rob McKemmish released Fixed <b>Disk</b> <b>Image</b> free to Australian law enforcement. [...] These tools allowed examiners to create an exact copy of a piece of digital media to work on, leaving the original disk intact for verification. By the end of the 1990s, as demand for digital evidence grew more advanced commercial tools such as EnCase and FTK were developed, allowing analysts to examine copies of media without using any live forensics. [...] More recently, a trend towards [...] "live memory forensics" [...] has grown resulting in the availability of tools such as WindowsSCOPE.|$|E
500|$|For many years, {{very little}} content {{from the game}} was ever {{released}} beyond screenshots that had been released to the media in promotion of the game prior to its cancellation. However, in 2006 {{a copy of a}} very early test engine was sold at auction to an anonymous collector who bought it for US$2500. An animated GIF image of the gameplay was initially released, and the <b>disk</b> <b>image</b> itself was leaked on July 17, 2007 after a fundraising project by the [...] "Assemblergames" [...] website community purchased the disc from the collector. [...] In 2006, Chris Senn opened the [...] "Sonic X-treme Compendium" [...] web site and began revealing large amounts of the game's development history to the public, including videos of early footage, a playable character named Tiara, and a large amount of previously unreleased concept music related to the title. He also was given permission by Hirokazu Yasuhara, the level designer {{for the majority of the}} original 16-bit Sonic titles, to post level designs that were going to be put in the game. Senn, along with the community, announced intentions to recreate the game, but ultimately the project was canceled in January 2010.|$|E

2500|$|Live {{images are}} the typical way for users {{to assess and}} {{subsequently}} install Ubuntu. These can be downloaded as a <b>disk</b> <b>image</b> (.iso) and subsequently burnt to a DVD and booted, or run via UNetbootin directly from a USB drive (making, respectively, a live DVD or live USB medium). Running Ubuntu {{in this way is}} typically slower than running it from a hard drive, but does not alter the computer unless specifically instructed by the user. If the user chooses to boot the live image rather than execute an installer at boot time, there is still the option to then use an installer called Ubiquity to install Ubuntu once booted into the live environment. Disk images of all current and past versions are available for download at the Ubuntu web site. Various third-party programs such as remastersys and Reconstructor are available to create customized copies of the Ubuntu Live DVDs (or CDs).
