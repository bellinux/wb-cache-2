5000|$|In Cases E-15/15 and 16/15, Vienna Life and Swiss Life, the Court {{ruled on}} the {{interpretation}} of Directive 2002/83/EC concerning life assurance. It held that Article 36(1) of the Directive does not address legal transactions according to which an existing unit-linked life assurance policy is transferred via a purchase agreement {{from one person to}} another where the <b>insured</b> <b>risk,</b> namely the insured person, under the assurance policy remains the same. Furthermore, a transfer of a unit-linked life assurance policy does not constitute a change in the policy conditions under Article 36(2) unless the terms of an assurance policy are also amended, thereby altering the balance of rights and obligations of the parties to an assurance contract. With regard to the referring court’s further questions on specific information duties under the Directive, the Court found, first, that if a “change in the policy conditions” within the meaning of the Directive has taken place, the referring court needs to consider whether the information listed in Annex III(B)(b)(2) was provided to the second-hand policy holder in a clear, accurate and complete manner and in an official language of the EEA State of commitment. Second, it is of no significance for the information obligation of the assurance undertaking whether the former policy holder was an undertaking and the new policy holder is a consumer, unless this difference has led to an amendment to the terms of the assurance contract. Neither is it of significance whether or not the original policy holder disclosed information about himself so that his own risk or investor profile could be assessed. As to the referring court’s question whether Annex III to the Directive has been correctly transposed into Liechtenstein law, the Court held that directives must be implemented into the national legal order of the EEA States with unquestionable binding force and the specificity, precision and clarity necessary to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty. Furthermore, national courts are bound to interpret national law in conformity with EEA law. Under Article 34 SCA, the Court has jurisdiction to give advisory opinions on {{the interpretation of}} the EEA Agreement upon the request of national courts. After the Court has rendered its judgment, it falls to the referring court to interpret national law in light of the Court’s findings. In cases where a harmonious interpretation of national law is not sufficient to achieve the result sought by the relevant EEA rule, that matter can be brought before the Court under the procedure prescribed by Article 31 SCA.|$|E

We show that consumption commitments can cause risk-neutral consumers to care about risk, creating incentives to both <b>insure</b> <b>risks</b> and bunch uninsured risks together. For example, workers may prefer to avoid wage risk while bearing an unemployment risk that is concentrated in as few states as possible. ...|$|R

30|$|While the {{expansion}} of private disability insurance suggests that many Germans responded to the reductions in public WDP benefits by purchasing alternative private policies, to our knowledge no research on this substitution has been published. Even if individuals are augmenting the WDP program with private insurance, the substitution is likely not perfect. Private disability insurance plans are experience rated and individually underwritten. Private disability insurance follows private insurance law {{and is based on}} a private contract between the insurer and the insured, which specifies the conditions for the <b>insured</b> <b>risk</b> individually. Premiums depend on age, medical diagnoses, and occupation. As a result, premiums can be very high for high-risk occupations and applicants may be denied coverage.|$|E

40|$|Underwriting cycles are {{unexpected}} in a structurally {{competitive industry}} where financial capital {{is the major}} determinant of output capacity.

This article provides {{a test of the}} two theories by examining the empirical relationship between capacity and underwriting margins.

40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} {{the existence of}} multiple dimensions of private information in the long-term care insurance market. Two types of people purchase insurance: individuals with private information that they are high risk and individuals with private information that they have high insurance preferences. Ex-post, the former are higher risk than insurance companies expect, while the latter are lower risk. In aggregate, those with more insurance are not higher risk. Our results demonstrate that insurance markets may suffer from asymmetric information even absent {{a positive correlation between}} insurance coverage and risk occurrence. The results also suggest a general test for asymmetric information. (JEL D 88, G 22, I 11) Theoretical research has long emphasized the potential importance of asymmetric information in impairing the efficient operation of insurance markets. However, several recent studies in different insurance markets have found no evidence to support the central prediction of many asymmetric information models that those with more insurance should be more likely to experience the <b>insured</b> <b>risk.</b> 1 In this paper, we use a new method to test for the presence of asymmetric information in the long-term care insurance market in the United States.

40|$|In this paper, we {{estimate}} {{the demand for}} homeowner insurance in Florida. Since {{we are interested in}} a number of factors influencing demand, we approach the problem from two directions. We first estimate two hedonic equations representing the premium per contract and the price mark-up. We analyze how the contracts are bundled and how contract provisions, insurer characteristics and <b>insured</b> <b>risk</b> characteristics and demographics influence the premium per contract and the price mark-up. Second, {{we estimate}} the demand for homeowners insurance using two-stage least squares regression. We employ ISO's indicated loss costs as our proxy for real insurance services demanded. We assume that the demand for coverage is essentially a joint demand and thus we can estimate the demand for catastrophe coverage separately from the demand for noncatastrophe coverage. We determine that price elasticities are less elastic for catastrophic coverage than for non-catastrophic coverage. Further estimated income elasticities suggest that homeowners insurance is an inferior good. Finally, we conclude {{based on the results of}} a selection model that our sample of ISO reporting companies well represents the demand for insurance in the Florida market as a whole...|$|E
