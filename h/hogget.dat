A total of 32 animals were used, 16 lambs (milk teeth) and 16 <b>hoggets</b> (2 teeth), which were distributed in a completely randomised experimental design and a 2 x 2 factorial scheme (two categories x two types of grain). In the categories under evaluation (lambs and <b>hoggets),</b> a significant difference (P≤ 0. 05) was found for total chewing time, idle time and other activities (expressed in min/day and as a percentage), number of meals per day, time spent per meal and for the weight of dry matter or NDF ingested per meal (g/DM per REF and g/NDF per REF respectively). For the grain under test (maize or sorghum), significant differences (P≤ 0. 05) were seen in feeding time, total chewing time and idle time (expressed in min/day and as a percentage) and for feed efficiency (g DM/h and NDF/h).

Of great benefit to industry was the finding that <b>hoggets</b> and adult sheep were relatively resistant to the clinical effects of OJD. Even though infection occurred, ewes rarely succumbed to the disease while <b>hoggets</b> were more resistant than lambs. This means that <b>hoggets</b> (median age in this study 22. 5 months) and adult sheep can be used to graze contaminated pasture with less risk of clinical impact compared to lambs, and so these classes of sheep can be used to prepare pasture for lambs. Pasture spelling should also be useful. Conventional wire strand fences do not prevent spread of infection so disease control needs to be based on an area-wide approach...|$|R

The F 1 cross <b>hoggets</b> used for the comparison of the wool producing ability, wool yield and characters of 5 Corriedale <b>hoggets</b> were 6 Corriedale × Southdown, 6 Corriedale × Romney Marsh and 3 corriedale × Border Leicester F 1 cross <b>hoggets.</b> Wool yields(grease fleece and clean fleece yield) and wool characters(wool fineness, stretched length of wool, number of crimps and wool density) at about 9 months after birth between the Corriedale and F 1 cross <b>hoggets</b> born in spring were compared in 1959 and 1960. The results obtained are summarized as follows; (1) No significant differences in grease fleece and clean fleece yield between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses were observed. However, the fleece yields of the Romney Marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses were higher than the Corriedale breed, while the fleece yield of the Southdown F 1 cross lower than the Corriedale breed. (2) There {{was no significant difference in}} the wool fineness between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses, except in the wool fineness(significant at 0. 1 % level) between the Corriedale breed and Border Leicester Fl cross. The wool fineness of the Romney Marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses was greater than the Morrisdale breed, while the wool fineness of the Southdown F 1 cross a little smaller than the Corriedale breed. (3) Difference in the stretched length of wool between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses, except in the stretched length of wool(significant at 1 % level) between the Corriedale breed and Southdown Fl cross, was not significant. The stretched length of the Romney marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses was greater than the Corriedale breed, while the stretched length of the Southdown F 1 cross smaller than the Corriedale breed.

After exercise the <b>hoggets</b> were split into treatment groups and fed three different levels (fasting, maintenance and three times maintenance) of the same ration. A subset of each group of <b>hoggets</b> was killed at - 24, 0, 12, 24 and 48 h {{from the time of}} exercise and samples taken from the liver, skin, rumen, duodenum, colon, kidney, M. semimembranosus, M. semitendinosus, M. longissimus thoracis et lumborum, M. psoas major, M. triceps brachii and M. subscapularis. Exercise caused a reduction in glycogen concentration in the liver and all muscles but not in the kidney, skin, duodenum, or colon tissues. After exercise the most significant changes in glycogen concentration were in the liver, muscle and skin. Metabolisable energy intake influenced the change in the liver and muscle tissue but not in the skin. It was concluded that glycogen concentration increased in liver before muscle and that this effect may contribute to the slower rate of glycogen concentration in muscle for ruminants compared with monogastric animals.

The daytime distribution and {{activity of the}} <b>hoggets,</b> dung distribution, and Olsen-P levels of topsoils were recorded on ten altitudinal strata {{within each of the}} nine treatment areas. Dung frequency was more closely correlated to grazing distribution than to either resting or total animal distribution. This is contrary to the generally accepted belief that dung accumulation is associated with resting behaviour. Increasing stocking rate led to a more even grazing and dung distribution. Subdivision by itself did not improve the evenness of distribution although it may have enhanced the stocking rate influence. There was little correlation between dung frequency and soil Olsen- P levels, especially outside the night camp areas. This indicates the importance of factors such as plant uptake and herbage consumption in the phosphate nutrient cycle. Olsen-P levels were consistently higher in the high stocking rate paddocks relative to the low stocking rate. Levels in the medium stocking rate fluctuated between these two. The implications of these findings in regard to the effects of intensification of farming in the high country on nutrient cycling and fertiliser requirements are discussed...|$|R

Se utilizaron esponjas intravaginales con 60 mg de acetato de medroxiprogesterona por 10 días y al retiro de las mismas se administraron 300 UI (grupo G 300) ó 500 UI (grupo G 500) de eCG. El porcentaje de celo no fue diferente entre grupos (Ensayo 1 = 100 %; Ensayo 2 = 81, 2 %). En el Ensayo 1 se observó una tendencia a diferir en el porcentaje de borregas que ovularon (G 300 = 50, 0 %; G 500 = 90, 0 %. P= 0, 06) y una {{diferencia significativa}} en el porcentaje de preñez (G 300 = 20, 0 %; G 500 = 70, 0 %. P The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the reproductive performance of seasonally anoestrus <b>hoggets</b> (Trial 1) and ewes (Trial 2) (Frisona x Corriedale) treated with intravaginal sponges containing 60 mg of medroxiprogesterone acetate during 10 days and different doses of eCG. At the end of treatment, 300 IU of eCG (group G 300) or 500 IU of eCG (group G 500) were injected intramuscularly. Oestrus rate was not different between groups (Trial 1 = 100 %; Trial 2 = 81. 2 %; P> 0. 05). In the trial 1, the percentage of <b>hoggets</b> that ovulated tended to differ between groups (G 300 = 50. 0 %; G 500 = 90. 0 %; P= 0. 06) and the pregnancy rate was signifi cant different (G 300 = 20. 0 %; G 500 = 70. 0 %; P< 0. 05). In the trial 2, the pregnancy and the fertility rates were signifi cant different between groups G 300 and G 500 (6. 3 and 9. 1 vs 56. 3 and 60. 0 % respectively; P< 0. 05). It was concluded that the use of 300 UI of eCG in a treatment of oestrus induction of seasonally anoestrus <b>hoggets</b> and ewes affect negatively the reproductive performance compared with the use of 500 UI of eCG...|$|R
