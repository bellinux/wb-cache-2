500|$|... "A {{month before}} I start shooting, I sit with my director, try to {{understand}} how he has visualised the character {{on the screen and}} take notes. Then I start working on the most basic thing— the look. It's very important that the physical appearance of the character gets decided because if I look the character, it makes it all the more believable. Once that is achieved, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> finer nuances of what the girl is like, her background. And then from there [...] I have to get the accent right".|$|E
500|$|He {{had earlier}} had trials at Manchester United and Middlesbrough in 2002, and further trials at West Ham United and Rangers in 2004. Jones {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} with Simon Bird that he had to travel around Europe looking for a football club, or face a career in the Trinidad army; he said [...] "It was hard because I'd just had my son and it was make it— or join the army.

500|$|Moondance was {{recorded}} from August to September 1969 at the Studio A penthouse of A & R Studios in New York City. It {{was the first}} album for which Morrison was credited as the producer; he later said [...] "no one knew what I was looking for except me, so I just did it." [...] Around this time, the singer made it known to Warner Bros. {{that he would be}} lead production duties for all his future recordings, which forced producers recruited by the label into assisting roles. It also led to frequent enlisting and dismissal of musicians to meet Morrison's creative vision. Lewis Merenstein—Moondances executive producer—had brought in Astral Weeks session musicians Richard Davis, Jay Berliner, and Warren Smith, Jr. for the first recording session at A & R Studios, but Morrison—according to Platania—"sort of manipulated the situation" [...] and [...] "got rid of them all. For some reason he didn't want those musicians." [...] While not an overbearing presence among the record's personnel, the singer later conceded to creating an atmosphere of artistic autonomy during the sessions: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio, I'm a magician. I make things happen. Whatever is working in that particular space at that particular time, I use, I take advantage of." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna also enlisted American {{professional}} boxer Mike Tyson to give {{a speech}} that would be used on the track. According to the singer, [...] "I was thinking: who is in my eyes super iconic, who do I look up to, who is alive today that's been through what I feel like I've been through, that's been through a lot, survived, has stories to tell, has evolved as human being [...] is a survivor, his name came to mind right away." [...] She also revealed that she was moved and impressed after seen his HBO-documentary [...] "Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth", directed by Spike Lee and contacted him. Tyson revealed that he ad-libbed his part of the song in one take and was inspired by Benito Mussolini, who Tyson admitted that was seen as arrogant, but he tried to come from a positive perspective and be uplifting. In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> studio and I didn't know if she wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} made {{popular in the}} 1971 movie Evel Knievel {{starring}} George Hamilton.

2500|$|Fang Xuanling {{had served}} Your Imperial Majesty {{for a long}} time. [...] He is careful, {{and all of his}} {{wonderful}} strategies and secret plans were not revealed to anyone. [...] Unless there is a particularly good reason, I hope that you will not abandon him. [...] As to my Zhangsun clan, many of them enjoy high salaries and high positions on account of our marriage, not because of their great virtues, and therefore they can crumble easily. [...] In order to preserve the Zhangsuns, I hope that you will not put them in powerful positions, and that they would be satisfied with seeing you at imperial gatherings the first and 15th day of each month. [...] During my lifetime, I made no contributions to the people, and I should not harm them in my death. [...] I hope that you will not build a tomb to cause the people to labor and the empire to waste resources. [...] Make a hill my tomb, and only use brick or wooden implements in the tomb. [...] I hope that Your Imperial Majesty will continue to be close to honest men and stay away from those lacking virtues; that you will accept faithful words and reject wicked flattery; that you will decrease labor and stop hunting. [...] Even as <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> underworld, if these things happen, I will have no regrets. [...] It is not necessary to summon the sons and daughters back here; if I see them mourn and cry, I will only be saddened.|$|E

For it was a special occasion. I don't know what. It may have been my birthday.|$|R
