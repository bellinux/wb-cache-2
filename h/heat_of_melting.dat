5000|$|Regelation is the {{phenomenon}} of melting under pressure and freezing again when the pressure is reduced. Many sources state that regelation can be demonstrated by looping a fine wire around a block of ice, with a heavy weight attached to it. The pressure exerted on the ice slowly melts it locally, permitting the wire {{to pass through the}} entire block. The wire's track will refill as soon as pressure is relieved, so the ice block will remain solid even after wire passes completely through. This experiment is possible for ice at −10 °C or cooler, and while essentially valid, the details of the process by which the wire passes through the ice are complex. [...] The phenomenon works best with high thermal conductivity materials such as copper, since latent heat of fusion from the top side needs to be transferred to the lower side to supply latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>melting.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceNumerical models {{show that}} {{small-scale}} convection (SSC) occurring atop a mantle plume is a plausible mechanism to rejuvenate the lithosphere. The triggering of SSC {{depends on the}} density contrast and on the rheology of the unstable layer underlying the stagnant {{upper part of the}} thermal boundary layer (TBL). Partial melting may change both properties. We analyze, using 2 -D numerical simulations, how partial melting influences the dynamics of time-dependent SSC instabilities and the resulting thermo-mechanical rejuvenation of an oceanic plate moving atop of a plume. Our simulations show a complex behavior, with acceleration, no change, or delay of the SSC onset, due to competing effects of the latent heat of partial melting, which cools the plume material, and of the buoyancy increase associated with both melt retention and depletion of residue following melt extraction. The melt-induced viscosity reduction is too localized to affect significantly SSC dynamics. Faster SSC triggering is promoted for low melting degrees (low plume temperature anomalies, thick lithosphere, or fast moving plates), which limit both the temperature reduction due to latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> and the accumulation of depleted buoyant residue in {{the upper part of the}} unstable layer. In contrast, high partial melting degrees lead to a strong temperate decrease due to latent <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>melting</b> and development of a thick depleted layer within the sublithospheric convecting layer, which delay the development of gravitational instabilities.
