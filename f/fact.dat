5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, <b>fact</b> is an {{exception}} to the general rule that the High Court does not judicially review errors of <b>fact.</b> Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service ("the GCHQ case", 1983) – illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety – an error as to a precedent <b>fact</b> may be regarded as a form of illegality.|$|E
5|$|An error as to a {{precedent}} <b>fact,</b> if committed, deprives the public authority {{of power to}} take the action or make the decision in question. The existence or non-existence of the <b>fact,</b> {{as the case may}} be, is a condition precedent or prerequisite to the exercise of the power. An example of an error of this nature {{can be found in the}} United Kingdom case White & Collins v. Minister of Health (1939). In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} <b>fact,</b> and the minister had committed an error concerning this <b>fact.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{principle}} of moral supervenience states that moral predicates (e.g., permissible, obligatory, forbidden, etc.), and hence moral <b>facts</b> attributing these predicates to various particular actions or action-types, supervene, or {{are defined by}} and depend, upon non-moral <b>facts.</b> The moral <b>facts</b> are hence said to be supervenient <b>facts,</b> and the non-moral <b>facts</b> the supervenience base of the former. The principle is sometimes qualified to say that moral <b>facts</b> supervene upon natural <b>facts,</b> i.e., observable, empirical <b>facts</b> within space-time, but a broader conception could allow the supervenience base to include any non-moral <b>facts,</b> including (if there are any) non-natural <b>facts</b> (e.g., divine commands, Platonic truths).|$|R

50|$|Mental <b>facts</b> {{include such}} things as perceptions, feelings, and judgments. Mental <b>facts</b> are {{ultimately}} caused by physical <b>facts,</b> in that mental <b>facts</b> depend on physical and biological functions which are required for consciousness.

5|$|In the United Kingdom, the House of Lords {{has held}} {{that the nature of}} the {{decision-making}} process that the public authority is required to engage in determines whether a matter falls into the precedent <b>fact</b> category.
