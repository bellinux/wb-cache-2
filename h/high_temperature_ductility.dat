At the Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratory (DMRL), Hyderabad, electroslag melting technologies {{have been developed for}} recycling light scrap of valuable metals and alloys such as superalloys and oxygen free high conductivity (OFHC) copper.

Several matrix compositions were designed to match the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of the SiC fibers using a rule of mixture (ROM) approach. The CTE values of these matrices were determined and it was demonstrated that they were generally in good agreement with that of monolithic SiC between room temperature and 1525 K. The parameters to hot press the powders were optimized, and specimens were fabricated for determining bend strength, CTE, oxidation and microstructural characteristics of the engineered matrices. The oxidation tests revealed that some of the matrices exhibited catastrophic oxidation, and therefore, these were eliminated from further consideration.

The materials were deformed at elevated temperature by the test methods of plane strain compression (PSC) and torsion to provide stress-strain data for the formulation of constitutive relationships. Torsion testing also provided <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>ductility</b> data. Isothermal annealing of rolled samples was carried out at the solution temperature of 530 °C to investigate the recrystallisation kinetics and microstructures produced, with particular emphasis {{on the effect of}} the inclusion of reinforcement particles on the behaviour of the matrix alloy.

High values of the activation energy are calculated for the deformation of both the alloy and composite from the PSC test data. The equations obtained from the two different test methods are found to be comparable for the composite material, but a discrepancy is found for the monolithic alloy, where apparently less hardening results from torsion testing. A distinct transition in microstructure from recrystallised equiaxed grains when deformed at low temperature to an elongated, sometimes partially recrystallised, structure for material rolled at high temperature is present in the monolithic material. This is attributed to the balance of recrystallisation driving force and the Zener pinning force exerted by the 13 ' (A 1 3 Zr) phase. The composite material exhibited greatly enhanced recrystallisation kinetics in agreement with the theory of particle stimulated nucleation (PSN) of recrystallisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{advent of}} Ni based {{superalloys}} revolutionized the <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> alloy industry. These materials {{are capable of}} operating in extremely harsh environments, comprising of temperatures around 1050 C, under oxidative conditions. Demands for increased fuel efficiency, however, has highlighted the need for materials {{that can be used}} under oxidative conditions at temperatures in excess of 1200 C. The Ni based superalloys are restricted to lower temperatures due to the presence of a number of low melting phases that melt in the 1250 - 1450 C, resulting in softening of the alloys above 1000 C. Therefore, recent research directions have been skewed towards exploring and developing newer alloy systems. This thesis comprises a part of such an effort. Techniques for rapid thermodynamic assessments were developed and applied to two different systems - Mo-Si alloys with transition metal substitutions (and this forms {{the first part of the}} thesis) and Ni-Al alloys with added components for providing <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> strength and <b>ductility.</b> A hierarchical approach towards alloy design indicated the Mo-Ni-Al system as a prospective candidate for <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> applications. Investigations on microstructures and oxidation behavior, under both isothermal and cyclic conditions, of these alloys constitute the second part of this thesis. It was seen that refractory metal systems show a marked microstructure dependence of oxidation...|$|R
40|$|T 91 grade steels {{showed a}} gradual {{enhancement}} in tensile <b>ductility</b> at ambient <b>temperature</b> {{due to an}} increase in Si content from 0. 5 to 2. 0 weight percent (wt. %). However, the ultimate tensile strength was reduced only above 1. 5 wt. % Si. The corrosion potential became more active in an acidic solution with increasing temperature. The cracking susceptibility in a similar environment under a slow-strain-rate (SSR) condition was enhanced at <b>higher</b> <b>temperatures</b> showing reduced <b>ductility,</b> time to failure, and true failure stress. Cathodic potentials applied to the test specimens in SSR testing caused an enhanced cracking tendency at 30 and 60 °C, suggesting hydrogen embrittlement as a possible mechanism of failure. Cracking of precracked and wedge-loaded double-cantilever-beam specimens was enhanced at higher initial stress intensity factors. In general, steels with 2. 0 wt. % Si showed inferior corrosion resistance. A combination of cleavage and intergranular brittle failure was seen in the tested specimens {{depending on the type of}} testing...|$|R
40|$|Nickel base {{superalloys}} must {{be replaced}} if the demand for the materials continues to rise for applications beyond 1000 {sup o}C which is the upper limit for such alloys at this time. There are non-metallic materials available for such <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> applications but they all present processing difficulties {{because of the lack}} of ductility. Metallic systems can present a chance to find materials with adequate room <b>temperature</b> <b>ductility.</b> Obviously the system must contain elements with high melting points. Nb has been chosen by many investigators which has a potential of being considered as a candidate if alloyed properly. This research is exploring the Nb-W-Cr system for the possible choice of alloys to be used as a <b>high</b> <b>temperature</b> material...|$|R
