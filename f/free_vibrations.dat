40|$|Stiffness and damping {{properties}} were measured for 9. 5 - 20 bias and radial agricultural drive tires at three inflation pressures. Vertical properties were determined with load-deflection, non-rolling and rolling <b>free</b> <b>vibration</b> tests. Torsional properties were determined with torque-deflection and torsional <b>free</b> <b>vibration</b> tests. ^ Higher vertical stiffness values were achieved from non-rolling <b>free</b> <b>vibration</b> than load-deflection and rolling <b>free</b> <b>vibration.</b> The non-rolling vertical stiffness for the bias tire was about 50 {{percent higher than}} that obtained from load-deflection. Higher vertical stiffness values were achieved from load-deflection than rolling <b>free</b> <b>vibration.</b> ^ With load-deflection and non-rolling <b>free</b> <b>vibration,</b> the bias tire was approximately 40 percent stiffer than the radial while rolling <b>free</b> <b>vibration</b> showed the bias tire was 25 percent stiffer than the radial. Vertical damping coefficients from non-rolling <b>free</b> <b>vibration</b> were 50 - 70 percent higher than those from rolling <b>free</b> <b>vibration.</b> ^ The torsional stiffness for the bias tire was about 50 percent {{greater than that of}} the radial tire for both measurement methods. ^ Torsional damping increased with increasing deflection and decreasing inflation pressure. The torsional damping coefficient for both tires increased 15 to 20 percent over the range of torsional deflections. ^ Tire behavior due to the slip-stick phenomenon was simulated using a two degree of freedom model that allowed torsional movement of the tire carcass relative to the wheel and vertical movement of the tire on a swing arm. Tire response was simulated for each tire at three inflation pressures. The method of measuring tire properties had an impact on simulation results, but not much impact on carcass movement due to the slip-stick phenomenon. Differing stiffness values resulted in different equilibrium positions for the various simulations. Increased damping resulted in a higher rate of decay of oscillations. Inflation pressure had more impact on tire stability than tire property measurement methods. Even though both tires were modeled at rated load for each inflation pressure, the reduced torsional damping at higher inflation pressures resulted in a less stable system. The bias tire was more stable than the radial. ...|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{vibration}}s: free and forced. <b>Free</b> <b>vibrations</b> are the natural or normal modes of vibration for a substance. Forced vibrations are caused by some sort of excitation to make the analyte resonate beyond its normal modes. ARS employs forced vibrations upon the analyte unlike most commonly used techniques which use <b>free</b> <b>vibrations</b> to measure the analyte. ARS excites multiple normal modes by sweeping the excitation frequency of an analyte with no internal vibrations to obtain a resonance spectrum. These resonance frequencies greatly depend {{on the type of}} analyte being measured and also depend greatly on the physical properties of the analyte itself (mass, shape, size, etc.). The physical properties will greatly influence the range of frequencies produced by the resonating analyte. In general small analytes have megahertz frequencies while larger analytes can be only a few hundred hertz. The more complex the analyte the more complex the resonance spectrum.|$|E
