5|$|Auricularia auricula-judae grows {{upon the}} wood of {{deciduous}} trees and shrubs, favouring elder. In up to 90% of cases, the mushroom is found on elder, but it is often incorrectly assumed to grow exclusively on elder. It has also been recorded on Acer pseudoplatanus (known in the United Kingdom as sycamore), beech, ash, spindle, and in one particular case, the sycamore draining board of an old sink in Hatton Garden. Recently, A. auricula-judae has been recorded from semi-evergreen to <b>evergreen</b> and wet <b>evergreen</b> shola forests in the Western Ghats, India. This species occurs scattered and in clusters on dead or dying branches of trees, on main trunk, decaying logs, etc. This species occurs during the monsoon period in large imbricate clusters and under high humid conditions produces exceptionally large sized basidiomes. A. auricula-judae growing in wet <b>evergreen</b> and shola forests shows remarkable variation in size, shape and colour. In Australia, it is found in Eucalyptus woodland and rainforests; in the rainforests, it can grow in very large colonies on fallen logs. It favours older branches, where it feeds as a saprophyte (on dead wood) or a weak parasite (on living wood), and it causes white rot.|$|E

40|$|Citation: Oman, Andrew Edward. Description and {{treatment}} of <b>evergreens.</b> Senior thesis, Kansas State Agricultural College, 1900. Introduction: The subject <b>evergreens</b> is at once of interest, for it suggests trees of durable beauty. Be it in summer or in winter, <b>evergreens</b> stand clothed in their never failing verdure. With the winter snow bearing down heavily upon their persistent foliage, they help to offset the bleak and barren aspect of a lawn or landscape during the winter condition. The study of this class of trees, then brings us into a broad field. It {{brings us to the}} consideration of the Natural Order Coniferae, the genera, which, with their many species, would require pages to tabulate. This treatise, therefore, will be limited to the <b>evergreens</b> represented on our college campus, and the following synopsis, taken from Hoopes “Book of Evergreens”, and will be the basis for the present discussion...|$|R
