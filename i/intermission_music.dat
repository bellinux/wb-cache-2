5|$|Che {{opened in}} single theaters in N.Y.C. and L.A. where it made $60,100 with sellouts of both venues. Based on this success, IFC Films {{executives}} added two weekends of exclusive {{runs for the}} roadshow version, starting 24 December in N.Y.C. and 26 December in L.A. This successful run prompted IFC Films to show this version in nine additional markets on 16 January. Che will be shown in its entirety, commercial and trailer free with an intermission and limited edition program book at every screening.

500|$|Kubrick's {{rationale}} for editing {{the film was}} to tighten the narrative. Reviews suggested the film suffered from its departure from traditional cinematic storytelling. Regarding the cuts, Kubrick stated, [...] "I didn't believe that the trims made a critical difference.... The people who like it, like it no matter what its length, and {{the same holds true}} for the people who hate it." [...] As was typical of most films of the era released both as a [...] "roadshow" [...] (in Cinerama format in the case of 2001) and general release (in 70-millimetre in the case of 2001), the entrance music, <b>intermission</b> <b>music</b> (and intermission altogether), and postcredit exit music were cut from most prints of the latter version, although these have been restored to most DVD releases.|$|E
500|$|Yorke asked Bagpuss creator Oliver Postgate {{to create}} a music video for lead single [...] "There There", but Postgate, who was retired, declined. Instead, a stop-motion {{animation}} video was created by Chris Hopewell. The video debuted on the Times Square Jumbotron in New York on 20 May 2003, and received hourly play that day on MTV2. In June, Radiohead relaunched their website, featuring digital animations on the themes of mass-media culture and 24-hour cities. In the same month, Radiohead launched radiohead.tv, where short films, music videos and live webcasts from the studio were streamed at scheduled times. Visitors late for streams were shown a test card with [...] "1970s-style" [...] <b>intermission</b> <b>music.</b> Yorke said Radiohead had planned to broadcast on their own television channel, but this was cancelled due to [...] "money, cutbacks, too weird, might scare the children, staff layoffs, shareholders." [...] The material was released on the 2004 DVD The Most Gigantic Lying Mouth of All Time.|$|E

5000|$|In 2003, while curating the {{audiovisual}} {{component of}} the New Forms Festival, the nomigs met Bizzocchi and quickly formed an alliance.

5000|$|Because {{the film}} follows the stage musical so closely, and the musical {{did not have}} an overture, the filmmakers chose to {{eliminate}} the customary film overture played before the beginning of most motion pictures shown in a roadshow-style presentation. However, there is a solo by the Fiddler played over the opening credits (after the conclusion of [...] "Tradition"), there is an <b>intermission</b> featuring entr'acte <b>music,</b> and exit music is played at the end after the closing credits.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} theatrical {{release of}} Walt Disney's Fantasia, presented in Fantasound in selected large {{cities in the}} United States, never had an overture, <b>intermission</b> <b>music,</b> or exit music. Still, Fantasia was first released in the roadshow format, included an intermission in its first run, and was originally presented without on-screen credits to perpetuate a concert-going experience—the printed souvenir program, given out to patrons {{as they entered the}} theater, presented the film's credits.|$|E
50|$|The troupes' orchestras {{featured}} instruments {{such as the}} trumpet, the trombone, the violin, {{the trap}} drum and cymbals.

The play began as soon as the musicians had taken their places {{at the side of the}} stage.|$|E
25|$|The troupes {{orchestra}} {{would be}} made up of such instruments as the trumpet, trombone, violin, trap drum and cymbals. The orchestra would start to play popular songs of the day and marches in front of the theatre about an hour before the show to drum up interest.

50|$|The Alamo premiered at its 70mm {{roadshow}} {{length of}} 202 minutes, including overture, <b>intermission,</b> and exit <b>music,</b> but was severely cut for wide release. UA re-edited it to 167 minutes. The 202-minute version was believed lost until a Canadian fan, Bob Bryden, {{realized he had}} seen the full version in the 1970s. He and Alamo collector Ashley Ward discovered the last known surviving print of the 70mm premiere version in Toronto. It was pristine. MGM (UA's sister studio) used this print to make a digital video transfer of the roadshow version for VHS and LaserDisc release.|$|R

50|$|The {{game is a}} {{standard}} 3D platformer that plays heavily {{into the history of}} the character; every non-boss level features a maze that plays by the rules of the original game (though the Pac-Symbol still shows, letting the player survive being touched by ghosts up to four times). Every level is littered with Pac-Dots, fruits and ghosts, much of the music is modified from early entries into the series (one of the common themes in all the levels is the <b>intermission</b> <b>music</b> from Pac-Man modified according to the theme of the level) and the original Pac-Man arcade game was available for play from the menu screen.|$|E

50|$|Although it {{originally}} had a running time of 127 minutes (not counting overture, <b>intermission,</b> and exit <b>music</b> {{included in the}} 1969 theatrical release), the movie has often been seen since then {{on television and in}} 16-mm prints in a truncated 101-minute version, with some scenes shortened or deleted. In the 101-minute version, the sequences showing key passengers arriving aboard the Batavia Queen at Anjer and the voyage of the Batavia Queens lifeboat to Anjer are shortened, while the opening sequence showing terrified children at the mission school in Palembang, Charleys song and striptease for Connerly in their stateroom, and Charleys tearful pleas to Hanson to have Connerly set free from the box suspended above the Batavia Queens deck are missing.|$|R
40|$|The average student {{attendance}} {{figure for}} the 2016 Boise State University football season was 4, 854 students with a total capacity of about 5, 000 in the student section. The average attendance for the 2016 - 2017 Boise State University men’s basketball season was 986 students with a total capacity of about 2, 434 in the student section. For this study, Boise State University men’s basketball student fans were interviewed during the 2016 - 17 season. The purpose {{of this research was}} to discover why student attendance at football games is higher than at men’s basketball games at Boise State University. Data were collected via Qualtrics and paper surveys. Results gathered from the surveys include length of time student fans spend at games, what time the student fans arrive at games, if the student fans stay {{until the end of the}} games, and why the student fans attend the games. Data analysis confirmed that more students attended Boise State University football games than men’s basketball games. Additional findings regarding female versus male attendance as well as implications for further research were made. Understanding the effects of free giveaways to students, <b>intermission</b> performances, <b>music</b> variety and student spirit help to better understand student attendance at college games...|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} release ran {{for about}} 222 minutes (plus overture, <b>intermission,</b> and exit <b>music).</b> A post-premiere memo (13 December 1962) {{noted that the}} film was 24,987.5 ft (70 mm) and 19,990 ft (35 mm). With 90 ft of 35 mm film projected every minute, this corresponds to exactly 222.11 minutes. Richard May, VP Film Preservation at Warner Bros., sent an email to Robert Morris, co-author {{of a book on}} Lawrence of Arabia, in which he noted that Gone With the Wind was never edited after its premiere and is 19,884 ft of 35 mm film (without leaders, overture, intermission, entr'acte, or walkout music), corresponding to 220.93 min. Thus, Lawrence of Arabia is slightly more than 1 minute longer than Gone With the Wind and is, therefore, the longest movie ever to win a Best Picture Oscar.|$|R
5000|$|It was {{recorded}} in a garage in the Auckland suburb of Henderson. Waretini didn't have {{money to pay the}} musicians so he paid them in Kentucky Fried Chicken. Spending $96 to get a pile of the singles produced, he sent some to Radio 1ZB, then bombarded them with play requests. He managed to get it played at Auckland's Civic Theatre as part of their <b>intermission</b> <b>music.</b> He also recruited a news paper boy to sell copies to passing people for 50 cents each. This soon resulted in people going into record shops looking for it. Not long afterwards, CBS wanted to put it out. On April 3, 1981, the song pushed John Lennon's Woman from the number 1 spot. [...] It also reached no 7 in Australia.|$|E

5000|$|The {{design of}} the Music Box was {{indicative}} {{of the growth of}} the motion picture. The grand movie palaces that preceded it were multiple use facilities with stage and film presentation capabilities. The Music Box had no stage and, therefore, could only be a film presentation house. When the theatre was built, sound films were a new technology, and the plans included both an orchestra pit and organ chambers if sound films failed and silent film accompaniment was needed. The first known silent film presentation at the Music Box theatre was [...] "Wings" [...] in 1983 using the operators home theatre organ and accompanied by Barbara Sellers, the daughter of Preston and Edna Sellers who were Chicago Silent Film and radio theatre organ personalities of the 1920s - 1940s. The first Theatre organ - an Allen three manual electronic - was installed in the previously empty organ chambers, in 1984. The organ is now used for <b>intermission</b> <b>music</b> on weekends and for silent film accompaniment.|$|E
50|$|Unlike most Warner Brothers' early Technicolor films (with a {{huge number}} of them {{existing}} either only in black and white or are lost completely), Viennese Nights still survives in color. The film survived as a single nitrate Technicolor print in Jack Warner's personal vault on the Burbank lot, and transferred to the UCLA Film and Television Archive, along with the nitrate collection of studio prints. A full set of Vitaphone sound discs was discovered at Warner Bros. in 1988. Additionally, the Vitaphone discs for the Foreign Version (non-dialogue, but English-language songs and musical underscore) has also survived but without picture. The domestic version has been preserved by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, including the overture, <b>intermission,</b> and exit <b>music.</b> The Archive has created a 35mm Eastmancolor preservation negative from that print and the restored showprint has played archival engagements around the world. At the present time the film cannot be shown commercially or on Home Video, without the underlying rights being re-negotiated by the current copyright owner, Warner Bros.|$|R

5000|$|In November 1945, the University Committee on Undergraduate Activities {{issued a}} report {{describing}} Triangle as [...] "perhaps the most controversial of all undergraduate extracurricular activities. Despite obvious shortcomings, the Club affords many valuable opportunities to the undergraduate body and plays a very real part in alumni relations. According, it should be reestablished at the first possible moment." [...] The first post-war show, Clear the Track, opened in December 1946 and even managed a seven-city tour. But Triangle was beset with problems the following year for All Rights Reserved (1947-48). The Daily Princetonian reported, [...] "All Rights pretty nearly weren't reserved. A play by the same name had fizzled on Broadway for a bare month, in 1934, and the petulant playwright threatened to sue. Hasty consultation with a Broadway lawyer revealed that the author could not possibly win the suit and that matter was closed." [...] The club resolved tricky labor questions by employing union stagehands and music-hirelings, putting the later to work first in Philadelphia, where they were made to earn their fee by playing with the regular orchestra, and then in Washington, where they provided the <b>intermission</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
