25|$|If {{civilian}} control {{is the critical}} variable for military effectiveness, it {{raises the question of}} how {{civilian control}} is then to be determined. Huntington identified two shaping forces or imperatives for civilian control – (1) functional and (2) societal. He broke the societal imperative into two components, ideology and structure. By ideology, he meant a world-view or paradigm: liberal anti-military, conservative pro-military, fascist pro-military, and Marxist anti-military. By structure, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> legal-constitutional framework that guided political affairs generally and civil-military affairs specifically.|$|E
500|$|His autobiography, Conn Smythe: If You Can't Beat 'Em in the Alley, {{written with}} Scott Young, was {{published}} posthumously in 1981. The title {{was taken from}} Smythe's credo, [...] "If you can't beat 'em in the alley, you can't beat 'em on the ice." [...] In Smythe's memoir he describes it as the most misunderstood remark he ever made. Rather than meaning that his players should go out and bully the opposition, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> opposite; that his players should refuse to be bullied by the opposition.|$|E
5000|$|The name unedo is {{attributed}} to Pliny the Elder, who allegedly claimed that [...] "unum tantum edo", meaning [...] "I eat only one". [...] It is not known whether <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> fruit was so good he could eat only one, or whether <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> that <b>the</b> fruit was uninteresting so he ate only one.|$|R

500|$|Hogarth {{deliberately}} {{portrayed the}} subjects of the engravings with little subtlety since <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> prints to be understood by [...] "men of the lowest rank" [...] when seen {{on the walls of}} workshops or taverns. The images themselves, as with Beer Street and Gin Lane, were roughly drawn, lacking the finer lines of some of his other works. Fine engraving and delicate artwork would have rendered the prints too expensive for the intended audience, and Hogarth also believed a bold stroke could portray the passions of the subjects just as well as fine lines, noting that [...] "neither great correctness of drawing or fine engraving were at all necessary".|$|E
500|$|Throughout his cross-examination, {{prosecutor}} Hausner {{attempted to}} get Eichmann {{to admit he}} was personally guilty, but no such confession was forthcoming. Eichmann admitted to not liking the Jews and viewing them as adversaries, but stated that he never thought their annihilation was justified. When Hausner produced evidence that Eichmann had stated in 1945 that [...] "I will leap into my grave laughing because the feeling that I have five million human beings on my conscience is for me a source of extraordinary satisfaction", Eichmann said he meant [...] "enemies of the Reich" [...] such as the Soviets. During later examination by the judges, he admitted <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Jews, and said the remark was an accurate reflection of his opinion at the time.|$|E
500|$|Bonham's Case {{was deeply}} unpopular with the Crown; Coke {{was removed from}} the Common Pleas and sent to the King's Bench, in theory a more senior office but in {{practice}} a less rewarding one in 1613. In June 1616, he was suspended from office and ordered to [...] "correct" [...] his case reports. In October 1617, James I demanded an explanation from Coke of the reasoning behind Bonham's Case. Coke claimed that [...] "the words of my report do not import any new opinion, but only a relation of such authorities of law, as had been adjudged and resolved in former times, and were cited in the argument of Bonham's case". He refused to admit to any flaws with his writings, and his only corrections were minor errors and rearrangements of the language. If <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> case as an endorsement of judicial review instead of Parliamentary sovereignty, withdrawal of that endorsement has been inferred from his later writings.|$|E

500|$|The {{equipment}} of the Libyan line infantry {{has been}} much debated. Head has argued in favor of short stabbing spears. Polybius states that the Libyans fought with equipment taken from previously defeated Romans. It is unclear whether he meant only shields and armor or offensive weapons as well, though a general reading suggests <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> whole panoply of arms and armor, and even tactical organization. Apart from {{his description of the}} battle itself, when later discussing the subject of the Roman legion versus the Greek phalanx, Polybius says that [...] " [...] [...] [...] against Hannibal, the defeats they suffered {{had nothing to do with}} weapons or formations" [...] because [...] "Hannibal himself [...] [...] [...] discarded the equipment with which he had started out [...] armed his troops with Roman weapons". Daly is inclined to the view that Libyan infantry would have copied the Iberian use of the sword during their fighting there and so were armed similarly to the Romans.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Watership Down contains symbolism of several religions, or that the stories of El-ahrairah were meant to mimic some elements of real-world religion. When asked in a 2007 BBC Radio interview about the religious symbolism in the novel, Adams stated that the story was [...] "nothing like that at all." [...] Adams said that the rabbits in Watership Down did not worship, however, [...] "they believed passionately in El-ahrairah". Adams explained that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> book to be, [...] "only a made-up story... in no sense an allegory or parable or any kind of political myth. I simply wrote down a story I told to my little girls". Instead, he explained, the [...] "let-in" [...] religious stories of El-ahrairah were meant more as legendary tales, similar to a rabbit Robin Hood, and that these stories were interspersed throughout the book as humorous interjections to the often [...] "grim" [...] tales of the [...] "real story".|$|E
500|$|On 27 March 1849, the Frankfurt Parliament {{passed the}} Paulskirchenverfassung (Constitution of St. Paul's Church) and offered {{the title of}} Kaiser (Emperor) to the Prussian king Frederick William IV the next month. He refused {{for a variety of}} reasons. Publicly, he replied that he could not accept a crown without the consent of the actual states, by which <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> princes. Privately, he feared {{opposition}} from the other German princes and military intervention from Austria or Russia. He also held a fundamental distaste for the idea of accepting a crown from a popularly elected parliament: he would not accept a crown of [...] "clay". Despite franchise requirements that often perpetuated many of the problems of sovereignty and political participation liberals sought to overcome, the Frankfurt Parliament did manage to draft a constitution and reach an agreement on the kleindeutsch solution. While the liberals failed to achieve the unification they sought, they did manage to gain a partial victory by working with the German princes on many constitutional issues and collaborating with them on reforms.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{according}} to Ivinskaya, [...] "'The {{way they could}} write!' he once exclaimed – by 'they' <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Russian classics. And immediately afterward, reading or, rather, glancing through some verse in the Literary Gazette: 'Just look how tremendously well they've learned to rhyme! But there's actually nothing there – {{it would be better}} to say it in a news bulletin. What has poetry got to do with this?' By 'they' in this case, <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> poets writing today." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} and {{subsequent}} editions Malthus put more emphasis on moral restraint. By that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> postponement of marriage until people could support a family, coupled with strict celibacy (sexual abstinence) until that time. [...] "He {{went so far as}} to claim that moral restraint on a wide scale was the best means—indeed, the only means—of easing the poverty of the lower classes." [...] This plan appeared consistent with virtue, economic gain and social improvement.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his radio}} broadcast, he execrated the [...] "socialist {{abortion}} state", [...] "the occupied territories" [...] (by which <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> deprived multi-cultural suburbs of French cities), [...] "the stinking Karl Zéro and his anal-whore broadcast" [...] (using the French phrase anal-pute, literally [...] "anal-whore", a pun on Zéro's broadcasting station canal plus), [...] "crappy woodlice" [...] (referring to journalists), [...] "imbeciles who read Libé" [...] (referring to the left-wing newspaper, Libération), [...] "scouts" [...] (like Guy Bedos, Jean-Jacques Goldman) [...] "who once wouldn't {{have even been}} given a Christian burial".|$|E
2500|$|In 1988, {{one of his}} poems, [...] "Passers Between the Passing Words," [...] {{was cited}} in the Knesset by Yitzhak Shamir. Darwish was accused of {{demanding}} that the Jews leave Israel, although he claimed <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> West Bank and Gaza: [...] "So leave our land/Our shore, our sea/Our wheat, our salt, our wound." [...] Adel Usta, a specialist on Darwish's poetry, said the poem was misunderstood and mistranslated. Poet and translator Ammiel Alcalay wrote that [...] "the hysterical overreaction to the poem simply serves as a remarkably accurate litmus test of the Israeli psyche ... (the poem) is an adamant refusal to accept {{the language of the}} occupation and the terms under which the land is defined".|$|E
2500|$|Whatever {{its size}} and quality, {{near the end of}} the war Hitler wanted it {{understood}} that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> collection to be for the public [...] even though there were hundreds of artworks that were specifically marked for use in the Berghof, his mountain retreat, and for a castle in Posen which Hitler intended as another residence. Still, in the [...] "Private Testament" [...] he drew up the day before his death, he specified that the collection should go to the museum when it was built, writing that they were [...] "never collected for private purposes, but always only for the expansion of a gallery in my hometown of Linz on the Danube." ...|$|E

2500|$|Burgos' article {{came about}} in a period when there was {{considerable}} debate in Puerto Rico on whether {{the public school system}} was being used by then pro-statehood governor Pedro Rosselló as a political indoctrination tool or not. When historians disputed Burgos' claim (which was favorably viewed by Eleuterio) as a distortion of historical fact, Burgos was publicly ridiculed by some. Eleuterio went to the point of [...] "editing" [...] a newspaper article (first published in Puerto Rico's premiere daily, El Nuevo Día) in which he claimed that Puerto Rican history before 1898 and the Spanish–American War was almost non-existent, and that the Taíno natives of Puerto Rico were its first drug traffickers. <b>He</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> article {{to be used as a}} reference in Puerto Rican schools.|$|E
2500|$|When the schoolteachers {{asked why}} they were not {{entitled}} to the same bachelor's degree as the Harvard College students, Lowell defended the distinction. Though courses were comparable, the programs and requirements were different, since the many specialized courses required of the College students could not be offered in the Extension Program. <b>He</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> Associate in Arts degree to be distinctive. When Lowell learned in 1933 that other American schools had begun to award the Associate in Arts degree to students after the equivalent of just two years of work, he felt betrayed. He wrote: [...] "the name of Associate in Arts has been degraded, probably beyond recovery, by wicked, thievish, and otherwise disreputable institutions." [...] Harvard responded with a new Adjunct in Arts.|$|E
2500|$|John Corrill {{recalled}} that [...] "the first presidency {{did not seem}} to {{have much to do with}} [...] at first", and some of the Danites clearly saw this sermon as a sign of approval. The matter was tabled until the following Sunday (June 17, 1838) when Sidney Rigdon preached his Salt Sermon, in which he likened the dissenters to [...] "salt that had lost its savor." [...] He went on to state that the dissenters would be [...] "trodden under the foot of men." [...] Corrill stated that [...] "although [...] did not give names in his sermon, yet it was plainly understood that <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> <b>the</b> dissenters or those who had denied the faith." [...] Rigdon's strongly worded sermon may have played a significant role in encouraging the dissenters to leave the county.|$|E
