5|$|While the Picts and Scots {{would have}} {{remained}} pagan, most scholars presume that Christianity would have survived after {{the departure of}} the Romans among the Brythonic enclaves and retreated as the Anglo-Saxons advanced north. Their gods included Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, whose name was appropriated for the spring festival of Easter. While British Christians continued to practice inhumation without grave goods, the pagan Anglo-Saxons are visible in the archaeological record from their practice of cremation and burial in urns, accompanied by extensive grave goods, perhaps designed to accompany the dead to the afterlife. However, despite <b>growing</b> <b>evidence</b> of Anglian settlement in southern Scotland, only one such grave has been found, at Dalmeny in East Lothian.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Christianity in Scotland can {{probably}} be {{found among the}} soldiers and ordinary Roman citizens {{in the vicinity of}} Hadrian's Wall. The archaeology of the Roman period indicates that the northern parts of the Roman province of Britannia were among the most Christianised in the island. Chi-Rho inscriptions and Christian grave-slabs have been found on the wall from the 4th century, and from the same period the Mithraic shrines (known as Mithraea) which existed along Hadrian's Wall were attacked and destroyed, presumably by Christians. After the departure of the Romans it is generally presumed that Christianity would have survived among the Bythonic enclaves such as Strathclyde, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced, with their gods Tiw, Woden, Thor and Frig, all of whom gave their names to days of the week, and Eostre, whose name was appropriated for the spring festival of Easter.

50|$|In {{molecular}} biology mir-200 microRNA {{is a short}} RNA molecule. MicroRNAs function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by binding and cleaving mRNAs or inhibiting translation. The miR-200 family contains miR-200a, miR-200b, miR-200c, miR-141, and miR-429. There are <b>growing</b> <b>evidences</b> to suggest that miR-200 microRNAs are involved in cancer metastasis.|$|R

25|$|Retention {{of nurses}} by sending (often developing) {{countries}} {{can be addressed}} by improving working conditions, minimizing wage differentials, and promoting medical tourism. Retention can also be promoted through educational activities to improve job satisfaction. There can be additional unintended impacts of nurses migration abroad. For example, there is <b>growing</b> <b>evidence</b> that physicians in the Philippines have shifted to the nursing field for better export opportunities. The World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Manila believes the government should invest more into its health sector as it is 3% of the Philippines' GDP.

25|$|While the {{genetics}} of SLE {{are not very}} well understood, there is <b>growing</b> <b>evidence</b> for the involvement of specific genes in this complex autoimmune disease. Part {{of the complexity of}} this disease is due to the effects of both environment and genetics factors that may contribute to its development. Further compounding our understanding of the etiology of the disease is the involvement of several organ systems. Genetic studies of the rates of disease in families supports the genetic basis of this disease with a heritability of >66%. Identical (monozygotic) twins were found to share susceptibility to the disease at >35% rate compared to fraternal (dizygotic) twins and other full siblings who only showed a 2–5% concordance in shared inheritance.|$|E

30|$|In contrast, <b>growing</b> <b>evidences</b> on {{perioperative}} statins {{administration in}} cardiac surgery suggested neutral or even detrimental effects. In facts, two large, high-quality, trials randomizing cardiac surgery patients to receive perioperative statin or placebo were recently published [6, 7]. Perioperative statins {{did not prevent}} postoperative atrial fibrillation or perioperative myocardial damage, but acute kidney injury (AKI) was more common in patients receiving statin. All this evidence supported a potential neutral or even negative effect of perioperative statin in cardiac surgery.|$|R
25|$|The {{potency of}} the {{personal}} self and relational ties distinguish identity fusion from other forms of alignment with groups, such as “group identification”. In group identification, allegiance to the collective eclipses the personal self and relational ties to other group members. Because of this, the personal self and relational ties are not as involved in theories of group identification. Identity fusion theorizes that fusion measures should be more predictive of extreme pro-group behavior than previously proposed measures of identification. In fact, there is <b>growing</b> <b>evidence</b> of this. Measures of identity fusion are particularly powerful predictors of personally costly pro-group behaviors, including endorsement of extreme behaviors, such as fighting and dying for the group.|$|E
25|$|There has {{traditionally}} been skepticism about the psychological treatment of personality disorders, but several specific types of psychotherapy for BPD have developed in recent years. There is <b>growing</b> <b>evidence</b> {{for the role of}} psychotherapy in the treatment of people with BPD, with indications that both comprehensive and non-comprehensive psychotherapeutic interventions may have a beneficial effect. Supportive therapy alone may enhance self-esteem and mobilize the existing strengths of individuals with BPD. Specific psychotherapies may involve sessions over several months or, as is particularly common for personality disorders, several years. Psychotherapy can often be conducted either with individuals or with groups. Group therapy can aid the learning and practice of interpersonal skills and self-awareness by individuals with BPD, though drop-out rates may be problematic.|$|E
25|$|Farmers {{suicide is}} a global phenomenon. Outside India, studies in Sri Lanka, USA, Canada, England and Australia have {{identified}} farming as a high stress profession {{that is associated with}} a higher suicide rate than the general population. This is particularly true among small scale farmers and after periods of economic distress. Fraser et al., similarly, after a review of 52 scholarly publications, conclude that farming populations in the United Kingdom, Europe, Australia, Canada and the United States have the highest rates of suicide of any industry and there is <b>growing</b> <b>evidence</b> that those involved in farming are at higher risk of developing mental health problems. Their review claims a wide range of reasons behind farmers suicide globally including mental health issues, physical environment, family problems, economic stress and uncertainties. Significantly higher suicide rate among farmers than general population have been reported in developed countries such as the UK and the US.|$|E

25|$|Misuse of benzodiazepines is {{widespread}} amongst drug misusers; however, {{many of these}} people will not require withdrawal management as their use is often restricted to binges or occasional misuse. Benzodiazepine dependence when it occurs requires withdrawal treatment. There is little evidence of benefit from long-term substitution therapy of benzodiazepines, and conversely, there is <b>growing</b> <b>evidence</b> of the harm of long-term use of benzodiazepines, especially higher doses. Therefore, gradual reduction is recommended, titrated against withdrawal symptoms. For withdrawal purposes, stabilisation with a long-acting agent such as diazepam is recommended before commencing withdrawal. Chlordiazepoxide (Librium), a long-acting benzodiazepine, is gaining attention as an alternative to diazepam in substance abusers dependent on benzodiazepines due to its decreased abuse potential. In individuals dependent on benzodiazepines who have been using benzodiazepines long-term, taper regimens of 6–12 months have been recommended and found to be more successful. More rapid detoxifications e.g. of a month are not recommended as they lead to more severe withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Melas Chasma is {{especially}} {{believed to have}} once contained a lake, {{as it is the}} deepest part of the Valles Marineris system at 11km (7 miles) below the surrounding surface. From here to the outflow channels there is about a 0.03-degree slope upward to the northern plains, which means that if the canyon was filled with liquid, there would be a lake 1km deep before the fluid would flow out onto the northern plains. Melas Chasma is the widest segment of the Valles Marineris canyon system, located east of Ius Chasma at 9.8°S, 283.6°E in Coprates quadrangle. It cuts through layered deposits that are thought to be sediments from an old lake that resulted from runoff of the valley networks to the west. Support for abundant past water in Melas Chasma comes from the discovery by MRO of hydrated sulfates that need water for their formation. Moreover, in a recent study of southwestern Melas Chasma, using high-resolution image, topographic and spectral datasets, eleven fan-shaped landforms were found. These fans add to <b>growing</b> <b>evidence</b> that Melas Chasma once held a lake which fluctuated in level. A lake could have formed in the southwest part of Melas Chasma from runoff from local valley networks.|$|E
