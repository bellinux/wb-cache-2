40|$|Isolations of sylvatic dengue- 2 {{virus from}} mosquitoes, humans and {{non-human}} primates in Senegal show synchronized multi-annual dynamics {{over the past}} 50 years. Host demography {{has been shown to}} directly affect the period between epidemics in other pathogen systems, therefore, one might expect unsynchronized multi-annual cycles occurring in hosts with dramatically different birth rates and life spans. However, in Senegal, we observe a single synchronized eight-year cycle across all vector species, suggesting synchronized dynamics in all vertebrate hosts. In the current study, we aim to explore two specific hypotheses: 1) primates with different demographics will experience outbreaks of dengue at different periodicities when observed as isolated systems, and that coupling of these subsystems through mosquito biting will act to synchronize incidence; and 2) the eight-year periodicity of isolations observed across multiple primate species is the result of long-term cycling in population immunity in the host populations. To test these hypotheses, we develop a multi-host, multi-vector Susceptible, Infected, Removed (SIR) model to explore the effects of coupling multiple <b>host-vector</b> <b>systems</b> of dengue virus transmission through cross-species biting rates.

For endemic infections, stochasticity leads to variation in prevalence about the endemic level. If these fluctuations are large enough, disease extinction can occur via endemic fade-out. We develop moment equations that quantify the impact of stochasticity, providing insight into the likelihood of stochastic extinction.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{goal for}} the food {{industry}} {{has always been to}} improve strains of Lactococcus lactis and stabilize beneficial traits. Genetic engineering is used extensively for manipulating this lactic acid bacterium, while electropolation is the most widely used technique for introducing foreign DNA into cells. The efficiency of electrotransformation depends on the level of electropermealization and pretreatment with chemicals which alter cell wall permeability, resulting in improved transformation efficiencies is rather common practice in bacteria as in yeasts and fungi. In the present study, treatment with lithium acetate (LiAc) and dithiothreitol (DTT) in various combinations was applied to L. lactis spp. lactis cells of the early-log phase prior to electroporation with plasmid pTRKH 3 (a 7. 8 kb shuttle vector, suitable for cloning into L. lactis). Two strains of L. lactis spp. lactis were used, L. lactis spp. lactis LM 0230 and ATCC 11454. To {{the best of our knowledge}} these agents have never been used before with L. lactis or other bacteria. Results Electrotransformation efficiencies of up to 10 5 transformants per μg DNA have been reported in the literature for L. lactis spp. lactis LM 0230. We report here that treatment with LiAc and DDT before electroporation increased transformation efficiency to 225 ± 52. 5 × 10 7 transformants per μg DNA, while with untreated cells or treated with LiAc alone transformation efficiency approximated 1. 2 ± 0. 5 × 10 5 transformants per μg DNA. Results of the same trend were obtained with L. lactis ATCC 11454, although transformation efficiency of this strain was significantly lower. No difference was found in the survival rate of pretreated cells after electroporation. Transformation efficiency was found to vary directly with cell density and that of 10 10 cells/ml resulted in the highest efficiencies. Following electrotransformation of pretreated cells with LiAc and DDT, pTRKH 3 stability was examined. Both <b>host-vector</b> <b>systems</b> proved to be reproducible and highly efficient. Conclusion This investigation sought to improve still further transformation efficiencies and to provide a reliable high efficiency transformation system for L. lactis spp. lactis.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of pathogen persistence in vector-borne diseases {{is important in}} different ecological and epidemiological contexts. In this thesis, I have developed deterministic and stochastic models to help investigating the pathogen persistence in <b>host-vector</b> <b>systems</b> by using efficient modelling paradigms. A general introduction with {{aims and objectives of}} the studies conducted in the thesis are provided in Chapter 1. The mathematical treatment of models used in the thesis is provided in Chapter 2 where the models are found locally asymptotically stable. The models used {{in the rest of the}} thesis are based on either the same or similar mathematical structure studied in this chapter. After that, there are three different experiments that are conducted in this thesis to study the pathogen persistence. In Chapter 3, I characterize pathogen persistence in terms of the Critical Community Size (CCS) and find its relationship with the model parameters. In this study, the stochastic versions of two epidemiologically different host-vector models are used for estimating CCS. I note that the model parameters and their algebraic combination, in addition to the seroprevalence level of the host population, can be used to quantify CCS. The study undertaken in Chapter 4 is used to estimate pathogen persistence using both deterministic and stochastic versions of a model with seasonal birth rate of the vectors. Through stochastic simulations we investigate the pattern of epidemics after the introduction of an infectious individual at different times of the year. The results show that the disease dynamics are altered by the seasonal variation. The higher levels of pre-existing seroprevalence reduces the probability of invasion of dengue. In Chapter 5, I considered two alternate ways to represent the dynamics of a host-vector model. Both of the approximate models are investigated for the parameter regions where the approximation fails to hold. Moreover, three metrics are used to compare them with the Full model. In addition to the computational benefits, these approximations are used to investigate to what degree the inclusion of the vector population in the dynamics of the system is important.

The maintenance of RDV in rice plants for several years resulted in gradual accumulation of nonsense mutations in S 2 and S 10, absence of expression of the encoded proteins, and complete loss of transmissibility. RDV maintained in cultured insect cells for 6 years retained an intact protein-encoding genome. Thus, the structural P 2 protein encoded by S 2 and the nonstructural Pns 10 protein encoded by S 10 of RDV are subject to different selective pressures in the two hosts, and mutations accumulating in the host plant are detrimental in vector insects. However, one round of propagation in insect cells or individuals purged the populations of RDV that had accumulated deleterious mutations in host plants, with exclusive survival of fully competent RDV. Our results suggest that {{during the course of}} evolution, an ancestral form of RDV, of insect virus origin, might have acquired the ability to replicate in a host plant, given its reproducible mutations in the host plant that abolish vector transmissibility and viability in nature...|$|R
40|$|A number oi R. salmoninarum gene {{libraries}} {{were constructed}} in E. coli <b>host-vector</b> <b>systems</b> and screened {{for the production}} of molecules which may provide material for the immunisation of salmonid fish. One immunopositiye clone was isolated from a £coRI gene bank constructed in the plasmid vector pUC 18 and another clone, which possessed membrane-active properties, was isolated from a M«dIII gene bank constructed in the plasmid vector pBR 328. The immunopositive clone was found to contain the major portion of gene msa encoding the major secretory antigen of R. salmoninarum, known as P 57. The membrane-active clone possessed a broad activity against erythrocytes from a number of mammalian species and rainbow trout, but not rabbits. No lecithinase, caseinase or gelatin degrading activities were detected in active clones. The haemolytic product was not identifiable on either SDS-PAGE gels or Western blots of cells taken from the active clone. However, minicell analysis revealed that the membrane-active protein was about 65 K, and the promoter region of the gene encoding this protein was identified. Southern blotting showed that the gene was present in seven strains of R. salmoninarum of differing virulence. The gene was sequenced and the sequence analysed by computer. After comparison with the contents of the Protein Identification Resource database, the gene was found to encode a protein which bears strong similarities with a family of secreted zinc-dependent metalloendopeptidases and on this basis the gene was tentatively named mpr and the product, MPR. Aspects of the predicted structure and possible function of MPR are discussed. In order to simplify the purification of material for further studies, gene fusions were constructed, from msa, mpr and hly, a gene encoding another membrane-active product from R. salmoninarum, in either pMAL or pAX 5 vectors. The resultant fusion proteins were produced in a mainly soluble form and purified by affinity chromatography. The fusion proteins were found to be immunogenic in rats but only poorly inuuunogenic in rainbow trout. Epitopes of each of the fusion proteins were identified on Western blots by serum derived from rainbow trout undergoing a clinical outbreak of BKD and it is proposed that this provides circumstantial evidence that the native molecules are of immunological importance to BKD and may be usefiil candidates for future immunisation studies. Seven strains of R. salmoninarum were cultured in vitro under conditions of either ironrestriction or iron-sufficiency. Epitopes of each of the fusion proteins were identified in R. salmoninarum cell extracts and, in the case of msa, in the ECP. There is preliminary evidence that the production of MPR and the processing of P 57 may be regulated by the availability of iron or other metals. No evidence {{for the production of}} siderophores by R. salmoninarum was found, although culture supernatants did possess some ability to inhibit the binding of iron by transferrin. A strong iron reducing activity was found to be associated with R. salmoninarum cells and the production of reducing sugars accompanied iron-restricted culture conditions. Comparative discussion of the pathogenicity of R. salmoninarum and of other Gram positive intracellular pathogens is provided.
