40|$|Railway {{prestressed}} concrete sleeper is an imperative component of ballasted railway tracks. Its main {{function is to}} help distribute axle loading to subgrade and formation. By nature, the concrete sleeper is subjected to sagging moment at the railseat zone and to <b>hogging</b> <b>moment</b> at the middle section. Although behaviors of concrete sleepers under static loading have been enormously studied, their rotational characteristic and capacity under such loading have never been reported. The emphases of this paper are placed on the static behavior and rotational capacity of a {{prestressed concrete}} sleeper under <b>hogging</b> <b>moment.</b> An Australian manufactured concrete sleeper {{was used in the}} experiment in accordance with Australian Standards, AS 1085. 14. LVDT was mounted at the middle span for measuring the deflection. The inclinometers were installed coincident with rail gauge in order to measure the rotations at those positions. Strains at bottom and top fibres under loading were recorded by strain gages. In this paper, the load-deflection curve of the static four-point loading test is presented. Relationship between <b>hogging</b> <b>moment</b> and gauge rotation is underlined. Criteria of the measure based on wheel/gauge-holding capacity are also discussed for determining the rotational capacity of the concrete sleeper...|$|E

The constant-current accelerated corrosion method was adopted to accelerate the corrosion process. The loading test {{results indicated that the}} bending capacity of the corroded beams decreased slightly with increasing corrosion ratio of the studs. The corroded beams also exhibited an obvious decrease in bending rigid stiffness and increase in the slip between the steel beam and the concrete slab.

Using the verified model, a parametric study was carried out to investigate the effects of partial shear connection, along with the effects of reinforcing ratio and the presence of column web stiffeners, on the behaviour of semi-continuous composite beams.

40|$|Composite steel-concrete floor systems {{consist of}} a {{trapezoidal}} shaped steel deck, reinforcement and cast-in-place concrete. Depending on the span, height restrictions and application shallow or deep decks can be chosen. The shallow deck used within this thesis is the ComFlor 75. Due to the low self weight, a bundle of steel decks can be lifted to the desired floor and the individual decks are placed by hand to the correct location. Shallow decks normally are placed {{on top of the}} supporting beams and one ComFlor 75 can cover multiple spans. The deep deck used within this thesis is the ComFlor 210, this deck type is usually integrated with the supporting beam by placing it on top of the bottom flange or a steel plate that is welded below the supporting steel beam. This allows for a bigger internal lever arm, while reducing the construction height. After reinforcement is placed in the ribs of the ComFlor 75, meshes or additional reinforcement bars are placed in the top layer. This layer does continue over the support beams and creates a continuous floor system. Advantages of this composite steel-concrete floor system are: fast construction, low weight and a small construction height. At the supporting beams of this continuous floor, a <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment</b> and vertical shear force occur. Within the Eurocode 4, the <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment</b> and vertical shear resistance are calculated independently. The deep decks are not covered by the scope of the Eurocode 4. At a certain project (Case study: “town hall - Almelo”) the authorities asked if the vertical shear could influence the <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment</b> resistance as both were near the calculated resistance. This question is being answered by first looking into current researches [1; 2; 3; 4] and calculation methods. These have been used to find a suitable test setup. This test setup has been adjusted to practical values to cover the critical spans where M-V interaction could be a concern. A total of 5 experiments, 3 on deep deck (ComFlor 210) and 2 on shallow decks (ComFlor 75) have been conducted. In both cases first an experiment is done to determine the <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment</b> resistance with a low vertical shear force followed by an experiment where the specimen was fully loaded by a vertical shear and a <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment.</b> For the shallow as well as the deep decks no reduction in <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment</b> was found. All specimens failed in bending, even though the specimens were loaded by a vertical shear force surpassing the vertical shear resistance based on the Eurocode 4 and calculations done in practice. For the deep decks a higher <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment</b> was found compared to the calculated resistance. The steel plate underneath the integrated support beam {{was not included in the}} calculation, but did contribute. All 3 specimens failed close to the calculated resistance. It was concluded that with the maximum shear resistance V_Rd used in practice no M-V interaction was found. The actual vertical shear resistance V_U could be far greater than the conservative value of V_Rd used according to Eurocode 4 [5]. Under normal distributed load patterns other criteria will govern. Vertical shear can become critical at shorter spans, however this implies a significant high distributed force compared to common values. The question is if it therefore is of interest to know the exact V_U as it generally is not the critical criteria. There is therefore no influence of a vertical shear force on the <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment</b> with a 〖V≤V〗_Rd. To get a wider statistical base more experiments are advised.

40|$|In this paper, a {{research}} and development project is reported which aims to develop numerical analysis and design model for practical design of composite beams in building construction. In order to develop numerical analysis and design models for composite beams with shear connectors of realistic deformation characteristics, two dimensional non-linear finite element models are established. Shear connectors are modelled {{as a series of}} horizontal and vertical springs along the interfaces between the concrete flanges and the steel sections, and non-linear load slippage curves representing realistic deformation characteristics are readily incorporated. After careful calibration against test data, finite element studies of simply supported composite beams under sagging and <b>hogging</b> <b>moments</b> are described. It is demonstrated that the numerical results compare well with test data in terms of various structural characteristics along the entire deformation ranges. Hence, the proposed numerical analysis and design models are considered to be simple and yet effective for composite beams with practical geometrical dimensions and arrangements.

40|$|International audienceCracking of the {{concrete}} slab in the <b>hogging</b> <b>moment</b> region decreases the global stiffness of composite steel-concrete structures and also reduces the effect of continuity, thus making the structural behaviour highly nonlinear even for low stress levels.

The model includes appropriate nonlinear constitutive relationships for {{the concrete}}, the steel and tension stiffening effect. Furthermore, the discrete nature of the shear connection {{is embedded in the}} model and the tension stiffening effects are introduced in the analysis by using a concrete constitutive model proposed in the CEB-FIB Model Code 1990 which incorporates embedded steel. Special attention is paid to the <b>hogging</b> <b>moment</b> regions, where cracking occurs.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Continuous steel-concrete {{composite}} beams {{are widely used}} in the construction industry. The concrete slab is typically attached to an I steel girder by means of welded headed studs, which however are susceptible to several problems and need special considerations at hogging bending regions. In this paper, an efficient re-design for the steel I-shaped girders is proposed. The width of the upper flange is reduced while {{the depth of the}} web is increased which maintaining the same area of steel. The elongated web has perforations along its length and penetrates the slab {{in such a way that}} allows the concrete to form concrete dowels and thus achieve the required bond.

40|$|The use of steel-concrete {{composite}} framed buildings {{is particularly}} efficient for their high lateral stiffness, strength and ductility; therefore the structural performance achievable with these systems makes them particularly suitable for applications in seismic zone. However {{the current state}} of technical knowledge concerning the characterization of the structural behavior of steel-concrete composite systems subjected to seismic actions is not exhaustive and requires additional theoretical and experimental studies in order to better understand their behavior and improve the design procedures. Often these shortcomings mean that the choice of the framed structure as seismic resistant systems falls in reinforced concrete or steel buildings. In fact, {{in the case of the}} steel-concrete composite framed structures the complexity of the problem is increased by the identification of the role of the connection between the reinforced concrete component and the steel one. In light of this assumption, the research project undertaken in the three-years of PhD study has been addressed to the analysis of the seismic performance of the steel-concrete composite frames and the development of advanced computational models for the seismic design of this type of structure. In particular two aspects were selected and developed in this research field: the rotational capacity of steel-concrete composite beams under <b>hogging</b> <b>moments</b> and the rotational capacity of the connection between the composite columns and the foundation. All the decisions regarding the materials/connection models had the aim of characterizing as better as possible the three-dimensional FE models of the composite beams and the base column connection. The effectiveness of the models were investigated by the comparison between numerical and experimental results; the experimental tests on the composite beams subjected to <b>hogging</b> <b>moments,</b> had carried out by myself previously. After the calibration of the models, parametric analyses were performed. In the case of the beams an innovative approach for defining the moment-curvature relationships, considering the effect of the local buckling, was assessed together with an equivalent plastic hinge length, obtaining the procedure to calculate the rotational capacity. Also for the base column connection a plastic hinge length was defined, taking into account the effect of the fixed end rotation, in the case of a socket connection. Both the results, for beams and columns, represent the instruments for a reliable non linear analysis of the composite frames in which the dissipation of the seismic energy is addressed at the end of the beams and at the base connection, as typically aimed to the framed structures. The last step of this research was the implementation of the relationships assessed for the rotational capacity for the beams and the base of the columns, in the nonlinear model of a composite frame designed according to the requirements of the standards, both national and European. The results of the analyses, in terms of behavior factors and over-strength ratio, point out the good performances of the composite frames and their promising use to reduce the seismic risk of new buildings...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{research}} on dynamic amplification factors (DAFs) caused by traffic loading from simply supported to continuous (highway and railway) bridges. DAF is defined here as the ratio of maximum total load effect to maximum static load effect at a given section (mid-span). Another dynamic amplification factor FDAF {{can be defined as}} the ratio of the maximum total load effect throughout the entire bridge length to the maximum static load effect at a given section (mid-span). For continuous beam DAF/FDAF can be determined for both sagging and <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moments.</b> Noticeable differences appear among DAF/FDAF of mid-span bending moment in a simply supported beam, DAF/FDAF of the mid-span bending moment in a continuous beam and the DAF/FDAF of the bending moment over the internal support in a continuous beam. Three span lengths are tested in the simply supported beam models as well as three continuous beams made of two equal spans. Each model is subjected to a moving constant point load that travels at different velocities. The location of the maximum total moment varies depending on the speed. FDAF and DAF are plotted versus frequency ratio. The results showed that FDAF is often greater than DAF in simply supported and continuous beams. Also, FDAF of sagging bending moment in continuous beam is about 12 % greater than that the simply supported case.

40|$|The main {{aspects that}} have to be {{considered}} in the analysis of composite structures are presented and discussed. Most of composite structures concern floors of buildings and bridges, so that in this lecture the attention is mainly devoted to composite beams. To correctly evaluate stresses in the concrete slab an effective width is considered to account for shear lag and moreover, to account for local buckling phenomena, the sections are divided in four classes according to the slenderness of the parts in compression. The moment of resistance of sections is calculated through plastic analysis in sections belonging to class 1 or 2, whereas the elastic analysis is used for sections in class 3 or 4. In case of plastic analysis a partial shear connection may be provided in sagging moment regions; in this case the section moment of resistance is governed by the resistance of the shear connection. In the elastic analysis of sections the effects of creep and shrinkage have to be considered because they cause significant redistribution of section stresses. At serviceability limit states, besides the check on the values of stresses, the deflection and the crack width need to be limited. The tension stiffening of concrete in tension among two consecutive cracks needs to be considered to evaluate correctly the deflection in continuous composite beams. The global analysis may be carried out using elastic analysis. At ultimate limit state some moment redistribution to account for the inelastic behavior of materials and for cracking has to be applied to optimize the sections. The limits of moment redistribution are related to the maximum rotation capacity of the sections subjected to maximum <b>hogging</b> <b>moments.</b> A broad numerical study was carried out by the author to determine the permissible moment redistribution domain that satisfies at the same time both the rotation compatibility and the crack width in service.

40|$|In {{the design}} of {{continuous}} steel-concrete composite girders, cross section plastic resistance can be exploited in the sagging regions, where the compressed flange of the steel beam {{is connected to the}} reinforced concrete slab. However, elastic verification of cross sections is normally adopted in the hogging regions, where the compressed portion of the steel beam is unrestrained by the concrete slab and more prone to buckling. In a combined design approach, which uses the cross section plastic resistance in the sagging regions and the cross section elastic resistance in the hogging regions, the design must satisfy the condition that the sagging plastic moment can develop while the <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moment</b> remains below the elastic limit.

40|$|Nowadays, modern {{codes and}} {{standards}} such as the (Eurocode 4, 2004) deal with the characterisation of steel–concrete composite joints in building structures, mainly under <b>hogging</b> bending <b>moments</b> in the beam. However, in sway composite frames or when the composite structure is subjected to an accidental/exceptional event such as earthquake or column loss, the beam-to-column joint may be subjected to sagging bending moment, a loading situation which is not yet covered by the codes. This paper deals with the behaviour of composite beam-to-column external joints under sagging bending moments, mainly focusing on the specific joint component “concrete slab in compression”. Indeed, if reference is made to Eurocodes, the method recommended to characterise structural joints is the component method and the “concrete slab in compression” component {{has been identified as}} the missing component to be able to apply this method to composite joints subjected to sagging bending moment.

The mechanical behavior of minor-axis connections for bare steel joints and composite joints has been investigated by experiments. A comparison of the experimental results between the bare steel joints and composite joints shows that the mechanical behavior of the minor-axis composite joint is obviously effected by the reinforcing concrete slab, which is transversely reinforced for bending and is connected to the steel beam via shear studs, this is more in line with the mechanical behavior of the frame joint. The investigation indicates that: (1) Minor-axis joints with flush end-plate connections and seat angle with double web angles connections are all typical semi-rigid joints.

In order to facilitate connecting the beams, two horizontal plates, {{each side of the}} column, are welded to the upper side of the through-plate. The lower flanges of the steel beams are connected to the horizontal plates by bolts, and the upper flanges are attached to the concrete slab by shear connections.

A formula for calculating the mean surface strain in the slab, which allows for both drying shrinkage and tension stiffening, is proposed. Consideration of the parameters which affect cracking leads to a formula for predicting crack widths in composite beams. Comparison with experimental results shows that it is sufficiently accurate for design purposes. In a second series of tests, three 900 -mm deep composite plate girders with slender webs were subjected to combined shear and bending to study their ultimate load behaviour. Failure was due to the formation of a plastic collapse mechanism which closely resembles that observed in plain steel girders under similar loading. The addition of a concrete slab acting compositely with the girder increased the ultimate strength of the beam, but variations {{in the size of the}} slab and the strength of the shear connection had negligible effect on the beam's strength. An idealised collapse model, based on the experimental observations, is described and is used in the development of a method to calculate the ultimate strength of composite plate girders. It is shown that a design method for plain steel girders in the draft Part 3, BS 5400 may, with small modifications, be applied to composite plate girders...|$|R
40|$|A {{new type}} of precast {{concrete}} exterior beam-to-column connection is introduced in this paper. The connection consists of a precast U-beam, precast column with corbel, and interlocking bars to connect the precast column and precast beam; these bars, act as the flexural reinforcement to withstand the <b>hogging</b> and sagging <b>moment</b> subjected during testing. The beam-column joint was designed according to the strong column-weak beam principle. The static-monotonic loading {{was applied to the}} first specimen (P 1), while a quasi-static loading based on displacement control was applied on the second specimen (P 2). Tip deflection and specimen cracking were monitored during the tests. Plastic hinges were formed in the beam of both specimens. P 1 has no significant cracks in the joint, while P 2 has ‘X’ cracks in the joint but it was still deemed acceptable. The precast columns of both P 1 and P 2 were free from cracks. The connection met the acceptance criteria presented in ACI 374. 1 - 05. The development length of the interlocking bars, i. e. 800 mm from the column face, was sufficient to transfer the load from the beam to the joints and columns...|$|R
40|$|The {{companion}} paper {{presents the}} principles of a new design-oriented methodology for progressive collapse assessment of multi-storey buildings. The proposed procedure, which can be implemented at various levels of structural idealisation, determines ductility demand and supply in assessing the potential for progressive collapse initiated by instantaneous loss of a vertical support member. This paper demonstrates {{the applicability of the}} proposed approach by means of a case study, which considers sudden removal of a ground floor column in a typical steel-framed composite building. In line with current progressive collapse guidelines for buildings with a relatively simple and repetitive layout, the two principal scenarios investigated include removal of a peripheral column and a corner column. The study shows that such structures can be prone to progressive collapse, especially due to failure of the internal secondary beam support joints to safely transfer the gravity loads to the surrounding undamaged members if a flexible fin plate joint detail is employed. The provision of additional reinforcement in the slab over the <b>hogging</b> <b>moment</b> regions can generally have a beneficial effect on both the dynamic load carrying and deformation capacities. The response can be further improved if axial restraint provided by the adjacent structure can be relied upon. The study als...|$|E
40|$|In 1997 cracks {{were found}} in the {{relatively}} new movable part of the Van Brienenoord bridge, a repair method for steel orthotropic bridges has searched for ever since. For fixed bridges a solution was found: the steel deck plate is overlayed with a concrete layer with a thickness varying between 50 mm and 120 mm and on top of the repair layer a new wearing surface is created. The concrete layer is either connected by studs or by an epoxy layer. Movable bridges have a thin wearing surface. Due to weight restrictions, {{it is not possible to}} apply a relatively thick concrete layer on top of the steel deck plate. So, different solutions have been researched and the best option seems to be to overlay the steel deck plate with a thin heavily reinforced concrete layer. This method has already been analysed under static loads, but also the fatigue resistance should be guaranteed. This master thesis project aims at designing a 20 mm concrete layer in order to increase the lifespan of an orthotropic steel deck of a movable bridge by replacing the wearing surface of this deck by this concrete layer. The main topic dealt with is to determine the fatigue life of the repaired structure. It is assumed that the governing position in the structure is the connection between the trough web and the steel deck plate above the crossbeam. At this position the largest <b>hogging</b> <b>moment</b> exists. Three different alternatives are defined to come up with the most effective solution, all with the same composition, dimensions and material properties except the type of reinforcement. The repair method consists of a 17 mm thick high strength fibreless concrete layer, on top of an epoxy layer sprinkled in with calcinated bauxite. The different types of reinforcement are: epoxy coated and sprinkled in with sand Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer (CFRP), stainless steel and epoxy coated “ordinary” steel reinforcement, all with a bar diameter of 6 mm. The centre to centre distance of the rebars is 12 mm and the concrete cover on the rebars is 6 mm thick. The stresses occurring due to the fatigue loading based on the Eurocode (load model 3) are calculated and the fatigue lifetime of each material is defined. Since uncertainties exist about the fatigue behaviour of the interaction between materials, an experimental research has been started. Test specimens were created and dynamically loaded by a <b>hogging</b> <b>moment</b> in a four point bending test. In the experimental research it became clear that the steel reinforced alternatives fail by reinforcing bar failure, whereas the CFRP alternative fails by debonding of the rebars. Besides these failure modes, concrete cracks occurred in the anchorage zone of the reinforcement. These cracks have been further researched, because they might become critical in practice. It is concluded that the concrete is only governing in case of relatively high moments. Design and ConstructionCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
30|$|Openings in slabs {{are usually}} {{required}} for many different {{applications such as}} aeriation ducts and air conditioning. Opening in concrete slabs due to cutouts significantly decrease the member stiffness. There are different techniques to strengthen slabs with opening cutouts. This study presents experimental and numerical investigations {{on the use of}} Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (CFRP) as strengthening material to strengthen and restore the load carrying capacity of R.C. slabs after having cutout in the <b>hogging</b> <b>moment</b> region. The experimental program consisted of testing five (oneway spanning R.C. flat slabs) with overhang. All slabs were prismatic, rectangular in cross-section and nominally 2000 mm long, 1000 mm width, and 100 mm thickness with a clear span (distance between supports) of 1200 mm and the overhang length is 700 mm. All slabs were loaded up to 30 kN (45 % of ultimate load for reference slab, before yielding of the longitudinal reinforcement), then the load was kept constant during cutting concrete and steel bars (producing cut out). After that operation, slabs were loaded till failure. An analytical study using finite element analysis (FEA) is performed using the commercial software ANSYS. The FEA has been validated and calibrated using the experimental results. The FE model was found to be in a good agreement with the experimental results. The investigated key parameters were slab aspect ratio for the opening ratios of [1 : 1, 2 : 1], CFRP layers and the laminates widths, positions for cutouts and the CFRP configurations around cutouts.|$|E
40|$|Integral {{abutment}} bridges {{are becoming}} rather common, {{due to the}} durability problems of bearings and expansion joints. At the same time, among short- and medium-span bridges, multi-beam steel-concrete composite deck with hot-rolled girder is an economical and interesting alternative to traditional pre-stressed concrete solutions. The two concepts can be linked together to design integral steel-concrete composite bridges with the benefits of two typologies. The most critical aspect for these bridges is usually the joints between deck and piers or abutments. In this paper, an innovative beam-to-pier joint is proposed and a theoretical and experimental study is introduced and discussed. The analyzed connection is aimed at combining general ease of construction with a highly simplified assembly procedure and a good transmission of <b>hogging</b> and sagging <b>moment</b> at the supports in continuous beams. For this purpose, the traditional shear studs, used at the interface between steel beam and upper concrete slab, are also used {{at the ends of}} steel profiles welded horizontally to the end plates. To better understand the behaviour of this kind of joints and the roles played by different components, three large-scale specimens were tested and an FE model was implemented. The theoretical and experimental results confirmed the potential of the proposed connection for practical applications and indicated the way to improve its structural behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Failure {{mechanisms}} of engineering structures to various loadings {{are the key}} indicators for structural engineers to design and predict the behaviours of such structures. However, the undetermined post-failure mechanisms are of major concern after the structural collapse, due to excessive loading. The residual load-carrying capacity yields the safety allowance to public domain, in order {{to escape from the}} incident. In railway practice, the concrete sleepers tend to be subjecting <b>hogging</b> or negative <b>moment</b> at the mid-span, resulting in the negative bending of the sleeper and associated gauge rail rotation. Although the concrete sleeper fails, it still tends to hold the rail gauges. Therefore, it is essential to understand into the behaviours after failure of the concrete sleeper. This paper elucidates the post-failure mechanism and the residual load-carrying capacity of railway concrete sleeper. To achieve this, Australian-manufacturer’s concrete sleeper was employed for the negative bending test in accordance with AS 1085. LDVT was employed in deflection measurement at the mid-span while the inclinometers were placed in line of the rail support. The post-failure load deflection curves have been first presented here. The remaining part of the concrete sleeper was used to core for some samples. The concrete strength of 88. 5 MPa is found for the concrete material of this sleeper. Each prestressing wire has a proof stress of 1860 MPa. It is found that each prestressing wire restrains approximately 10 kN residual load-carrying capacity of the concrete sleeper...|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{methods are}} {{described}} here {{to predict the}} stochastic accumulation of fatigue damage due to nonlinear ship loads that are produced in random seas. The stochastic analysis method, which may be applied both to overload and fatigue limit states, {{is based on a}} relatively new concept: the “nonlinear transfer function ” (NTF) method. The basic goal of this method is to require the use of a generally expensive, nonlinear time-domain ship load analysis for only a limited set of idealized, regular waves. This establishes the so-called nonlinear transfer function; i. e., the generally nonlinear transformation from wave amplitude and period to the load amplitude measure of interest (e. g., total load range for rainflow-counting, tensile portion for crack propagation, etc.). Stochastic process theory is used (1) to identify a minimal set of regular waves (i. e., heights and periods) to be applied, (2) to assign an appropriate set of “side–waves ” to be spatially distributed along the ship, and (3) to determine how these results should be weighted in predicting statistics of the loads produced in random seas. The result is compared here with full nonlinear analysis of a specific ship, over long simulations of an irregular sea. A ship with relatively flared cross-section is chosen, which 1 shows marked nonlinearity and hence asymmetry in its positive and negative (sag and <b>hog)</b> mid-ship bending <b>moment.</b> The NTF method is shown to accurately predict the results of the long nonlinear simulations. This suggests the potential for considerable reduction in analysis costs: time-domain analysis over many cycles of an irregular sea is replaced by a limited number of regular wave analyses...|$|R
