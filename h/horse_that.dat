When shooting started, the <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> Tom McLaury held jumped to one side. Wyatt said he also saw Tom throw {{his hand to his}} right hip. Virgil said Tom followed the horse's movement, hiding behind it, and fired once or twice over the horse's back.|$|E
5|$|Although {{named the}} Jersey Act by a {{critical}} foreign press, after Lord Jersey, the new regulation {{did not have}} the force of law as it was promulgated by the registration authorities of the Thoroughbred horse, not by the United Kingdom government. Nor was it promulgated by the Jockey Club, which had no authority over registration, only over racing matters. The regulation required that any horse registered in the General Stud Book trace in every line to a <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> had already been registered in the General Stud Book, effectively excluding most American-bred Thoroughbreds.|$|E

50|$|Professor Jesse Beery (June 13, 1861 - February, 1945) was an American horse {{trainer and}} writer. He claimed he could train any <b>horse,</b> <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> ran away, <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> pulled too hard, <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> were spooked too easily and <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> {{refused to be}} shoed. His best-known work was Prof. Beery's Mail Course in Horsemanship, and sold widely through {{mail-order}} ads placed in various equine magazines. His horse training methods are {{claimed to have been}} used by horse trainers all over the world over the last hundred years.|$|R

5|$|In 1949, Davidson {{was born}} to Francis and Annette Davidson, the former a {{businessman}} and the latter a concert pianist. He was the third of four children, and had little opportunity to be around horses until {{his family moved to}} Westport, Massachusetts, when he was a child. A family friend introduced Davidson to horses, and he began attending Pony Club events. He bought, trained and sold horses until he found a championship horse in Irish Cap, the <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> took him to his first gold medal at the 1974 World Eventing Championship. Davidson went to college at Iowa State University with a veterinary major, but left in his third year to train with the United States Equestrian Team (USET).|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Field was {{introduced}} to Jack Laming of Walmer, who as a boy had performed in a hoodening troupe earlier in the century. Laming taught Field more about the historical hoodening tradition, and together they unearthed an old hooden <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> was stored at Walmer's Coldblow Farm; this artefact was later placed on display at Deal Maritime and Local History Museum. In June 1961 Field and his wife then established the first Folkestone International Folklore Festival as a biannual celebration of folk customs; it continued for 28 years.|$|E
5|$|Oxbow's second-place {{finish in}} the Belmont Stakes in June made him the third <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> year to reach $1million in purse wins. Following the Belmont, he was ranked the top three-year-old racehorse in the United States by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA). He was pulled up shortly after {{finishing}} fourth in the Haskell Invitational, and {{was found to have}} suffered a soft tissue injury, was taken out of competition for the remainder of his three-year-old season, and retired in October 2013. He stands at stud for the 2015 breeding season at Calumet Farms.|$|E
50|$|The Waler is an Australian {{breed of}} riding <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> {{developed}} from the <b>horses</b> <b>that</b> {{were brought to the}} Australian colonies in the 19th century.

In 1998, Stéphane Bigot made a crossing of the Pyrenees on a Mérens. Many tourist facilities now offer guided trail rides through the mountains of Ariege on Mérens horses, with some centers having a stable consisting entirely of members of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} passed onwards through Kejache territory, {{and arrived}} at {{the north shore of}} Lake Petén Itzá on 13 March 1525.

5|$|Although {{it gained}} recruits, the rising began {{to suffer from}} {{internal}} divisions, particularly between the Highlanders who made {{up the bulk of}} the forces and the Lowland nobles and officers who were their commanders. In early 1654, nine months into the revolt, Middleton, a Lowland officer and a veteran of the Battle of Worcester, arrived with a commission to command from Charles II. Despite objections from his followers, Glencairn surrendered control over his forces, which had now reached 3,500 foot and 1,500 <b>horse.</b> <b>That</b> evening Sir George Munro, Middleton's aide insulted Glencairn's forces and the result was a duel in which Munro was wounded. Glencairn was arrested. He would eventually be released and retire from the conflict. A series of other disputes and duels undermined the leadership of the campaign {{for the remainder of the}} rising.|$|E
5|$|Many {{years after}} the event, the Kentish {{antiquarian}} J. Meadows Cooper related that while sitting in a pub {{on the outskirts of}} Margate on Boxing Day 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> entered the building. Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child she had lived at a house named Updown that was near to Margate, and that she remembered the hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865. Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse which had appeared in Herne and Swalecliffe but which been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in Harbledown during the 1850s, and one that had been active at Evington but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at Lower Hardres which had been active from at least the least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.|$|E
5|$|Mounted Muslim warriors conquered North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula {{during the}} 7th and 8th centuries AD {{following}} the Hegira, or Hijra, of Muhammad in 622 AD. By 630 AD, their influence expanded across the Middle East and into western North Africa. By 711 AD, the light cavalry of Muslim warriors had reached Spain, and controlled {{most of the}} Iberian peninsula by 720. Their mounts were of various oriental types, including the North African Barb. A few Arabian horses may have come with the Ummayads who settled in the Guadalquivir valley. Another strain of <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> came with Islamic invaders was the Turkoman horse. Muslim invaders travelled north from nowadays Spain into France, where they were defeated by the Frankish ruler Charles Martel at the Battle of Tours in 732 AD.|$|E

5|$|Multi-purpose types {{like the}} Charolais and the Morvan were slowly supplanted in farmers' favor by draft horses. The Nivernais breed, in particular, was {{preferred}} by farmers and threatened {{the existence of}} the Charolais. Thus, the original small multi-purpose strain of Charolais gave way to a type of small draft <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> was next crossed with purebred and crossbred Thoroughbreds until, by 1850, it had become a horse for cavalry purposes. It was thought by some enthusiasts, however, that this outcrossing reduced the quality of the breed, and many missed the old-style Charolais, which had disappeared {{due to a lack of}} demand and use. However, others thought that the outcrossings had benefited the Charolais breed: in 1919, one author stated that the breeding of the Charolais type was in excellent condition, and a report from the time stated that the favorite horse of King Albert I of Belgium was a Charolais named Titanic.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 1, 1824, Desha {{attended}} a celebration at a neighbor's house. He later stayed the night at Doggate's Tavern in Fairview, just over the county line in Fleming County. The next morning, he ate breakfast at the tavern, joined by eight other men, including Francis Baker. Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez, Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey to marry a young woman there. Over breakfast, Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend, Captain John Bickley, {{who lived in the}} area. Desha remarked that he knew where Bickley lived and, intending to ride in that direction, asked if Baker wanted to join him. Baker accepted, and the two men left about 8 a.m. toward Maysville. Desha rode his bay mare and Baker his gray mare, a fine <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> had already attracted much attention during his travel through Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Orme was a bay colt born in 1889 at Eaton Stud in Cheshire. He was bred by the 1st Duke of Westminster. Orme stood 16 hands {{high and}} had a large white star, with no other white markings. His sire was the unbeaten 2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby and St. Leger winner Ormonde. Orme was one of Ormonde's first crop of foals. By the time Orme reached a racecourse, Ormonde had been {{exported}} to Argentina. Ormonde did not become a great sire due to fertility problems, producing only a few foals most years. However, he did also sire Goldfinch, a <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> was a top class two-year-old and won the New Stakes. In the United States, he sired Futurity Stakes winner Ormondale. Orme was clear-winded, unlike his sire, who was a roarer.|$|E

5|$|The Norman Cob or Cob Normand is a {{breed of}} light draft <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> {{originated}} {{in the province of}} Normandy in northern France. It is a mid-sized horse, with a range of heights and weights, due to selective breeding {{for a wide range of}} uses. Its conformation is similar to a robust Thoroughbred, and it more closely resembles a Thoroughbred cross than other French draft breeds. The breed is known for its lively, long-striding trot. Colors accepted by the breed registry include chestnut, bay and seal brown. There are three general subsets within the breed: horses used under saddle, those used in harness, and those destined for meat production. They are popular for recreational and competitive driving, representing France internationally in the latter, and are also used for several riding disciplines.|$|E
5|$|The Percheron is a {{breed of}} draft <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> {{originated}} in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name. Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their intelligence and willingness to work. Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed {{were present in the}} valley by the 17th century. They were originally bred for use as war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France to the United States and other countries rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.|$|E

On his departure from Nojpetén, Cortés left behind a cross and a lame <b>horse</b> <b>that</b> the Itza treated as a deity, attempting to feed it poultry, meat and flowers, but the animal soon died. The Spanish did not officially contact the Itza again until the arrival of Franciscan priests in 1618, when Cortés' cross was said to still be standing at Nojpetén.|$|E
