All five of Germany's first half goals came within the first half-hour, with four of them coming in one six-minute period. Brazil had no shots on target in the first half. Many Brazil supporters in the crowd were visibly in shock or reduced to tears. The resulting fights in the Mineirão stands forced the Military Police to send a special forces squad into the stadium.|$|E

5|$|Male adults may patrol individually, {{but most}} congregate in swarms a few metres above water with clear open sky above it, and perform a nuptial (courtship) dance.

The next stage of the day was canceled, so the drivers entered the final two stages separated by just 0.8 seconds. The second to last stage was won by Sordo, which left the Spaniard three seconds ahead of Neuville in the overall classification.

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the stage, many riders were trying to break away from the peloton {{to be part of the}} daily group of leaders, but in contrast to most earlier stages, it took a long time before finally a group got away from the peloton and was allowed to gain some time and distance.

But the two leaders don't get away and at the first intermediate sprint in Villedieu-lès-Bailleul, new names pass the line first. Most important to remember is Benoit Vaugrenard winning the sprint and therefore taking 6 bonus seconds which move him past Markus Fothen in the classification for best young rider.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{stochastic}} Economic Lot Scheduling Problems (ELSP), i. e., settings where several items need to be produced in a common facility with limited capacity, under significant uncertainty regarding demands, production times, setup times, or combinations thereof. We propose a class of production/inventory strategies for stochastic ELSPs and describe how a strategy which minimizes holding, backlogging, and setup costs within this class can be effectively determined and evaluated. The proposed class of strategies is simple but rich and effective: when the facility is assigned to a given item, production continues until either a specific target inventory level is reached or a specific production batch has been completed; the different items are produced in a given sequence or rotation cycle, possibly with idle times inserted between the completion of an item's production batch and the setup for the next item. An optimal strategy within the class can be determined, and all relevant performance measures can be evaluated in <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> CPU <b>seconds,</b> using <b>a</b> 486 -based PC.

500|$|Breeding {{behavior}} commences with a courtship chase {{with the}} female running in a crouch, pursued by the male, who adopts a more upright stance and has his neck outstretched. The female may stop and lower her head and tail to allow copulation; this takes <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> but may be repeated several times in an hour. The nest is a shallow cup of grass leaves, sometimes with a loose canopy, built in a depression and hidden under a grass tussock or small bush; it may be on dry ground or slightly raised above standing water, or occasionally floating. The nest is about [...] across with the internal cup [...] deep, and [...] wide. The clutch size is from 3 to 11 pink-coloured eggs; the first is often laid when the nest {{is little more than}} a pad of grass, and a further egg is laid on each subsequent day.

The black, downy precocial chicks soon leave the nest but are fed and protected by the parents. Fledging occurs after four to five weeks, and the young can fly before they are fully grown. It is not known whether a second brood is raised.|$|E
500|$|... "Enter Sandman" [...] moves at a {{tempo of}} 123 {{beats per minute}} for 5:32, running {{slightly}} above the average song length of the album. It begins with a clean guitar intro similar to the main riff; an E minor chord on a guitar using the wah-wah pedal is then introduced, followed by heavy use of tom-tom drums. Distorted guitars then build up to the main riff, which starts 56 seconds into the song and utilizes variations of the E/B tritone. P. J. Howorth, in The Wah Wah Book, characterized the main riff as [...] "sinister". The song then follows a common structure, playing two iterations of a verse, a pre-chorus, and a chorus. On the chorus and pre-chorus, the song modulates one whole tone, up to F, and after the second chorus, Hammett plays a guitar solo with the main, pre-chorus, and chorus riffs in the background. Hammett makes use of the wah-wah pedal and {{a wide range of}} scales, including e minor pentatonic, B minor, F minor, E minor, and the E dorian mode. One of the final licks of the solo was inspired by the Heart song [...] "Magic Man" [...] as used in Ice-T's [...] "Personal". <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> before the solo ends, the breakdown starts, in which the clean drum intro starts, then the clean guitar intro when the last notes of Kirk's solo echo over it into the background, are heard together with Hetfield teaching a child the [...] "Now I Lay Me Down to Sleep" [...] bedtime prayer and reciting a variation of the lullaby rhyme [...] "Hush Little Baby" [...] where he is heard saying [...] "Hush little baby don't say a word, and never mind that noise you heard. It's just the beasts under your bed, in your closet, in your head". After building again to a chorus, the song starts to fade out while the band plays the same riffs as the buildup intro in reverse order. Lyrically, the song is about [...] "nightmares and all that come with them", according to Chris True of Allmusic. The title is a reference to the sandman, a character from Western folklore who makes children sleep.|$|E
30|$|It {{may be a}} {{difficult}} task to separate metaphysical modality from epistemic modality (Condoravdi 2002, Abusch 2012). Thus, it is worth emphasizing here that adding reng and hai transforms the a sentences in 18, 20, and 21 from an epistemic reading to a metaphysical reading, rather than merely changing the temporal perspective from the speaker’s utterance time to a past time. More specifically, the sentence in 18 b, for example, does {{not talk about the}} speaker’s epistemic state during yesterday morning, viz., the speaker’s belief during yesterday morning that Zhangsan would win the game at some later time. Rather, the sentence describes a POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT as of yesterday morning with regard to the prospect of Zhangsan winning the game (or not). This claim is evident from the fact that 18 b does not require the speaker to have any knowledge during yesterday morning regarding Zhangsan winning the game, or anything related to the game at all. The speaker could felicitously utter 18 b even if she <b>just</b> learned <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> prior to uttering the sentence that yesterday morning Zhangsan was fully prepared and in a good position to compete in the game.
