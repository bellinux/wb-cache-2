25|$|The local {{speed of}} sound, {{and thereby the}} Mach number, depends on the {{condition}} of the surrounding medium, in particular the temperature. The Mach number is primarily used to determine the approximation with which a flow can be treated as an <b>incompressible</b> <b>flow.</b> The medium can be a gas or a liquid. The boundary can be traveling in the medium, or it can be stationary while the medium flows along it, or they can both be moving, with different velocities: what matters is their relative velocity with respect to each other. The boundary can be the boundary of an object immersed in the medium, or of a channel such as a nozzle, diffusers or wind tunnels channeling the medium. As the Mach number is defined as the ratio of two speeds, it is a dimensionless number. If <nbsp&0.2–0.3 and the flow is quasi-steady and isothermal, compressibility effects will be small and simplified <b>incompressible</b> <b>flow</b> equations can be used.|$|E
25|$|All fluids are {{compressible}} to some extent; that is, {{changes in}} pressure or temperature cause changes in density. However, {{in many situations}} the changes in pressure and temperature are sufficiently small that the changes in density are negligible. In this case the flow can be modelled as an <b>incompressible</b> <b>flow.</b> Otherwise the more general compressible flow equations must be used.|$|E
25|$|It is {{desirable}} to choose basis functions which reflect the essential feature of <b>incompressible</b> <b>flow</b> – the elements must be divergence-free. While the velocity is the variable of interest, {{the existence of}} the stream function or vector potential is necessary by the Helmholtz Theorem. Further, to determine fluid flow {{in the absence of a}} pressure gradient, one can specify the difference of stream function values across a 2D channel, or the line integral of the tangential component of the vector potential around the channel in 3D, the flow being given by Stokes' Theorem. Discussion will be restricted to 2D in the following.|$|E

40|$|This study {{reports on}} further {{development}} of a finite difference method formulated {{on the basis of}} a linearized-Boltzmann-type-equation for thermal <b>incompressible</b> <b>flows</b> with external body force effect. In classical lattice Boltzmann methods, a pressure-density relation, and/or a finite Mach number, no matter how small, are required in the solution of the linearized Boltzmann-type equation, thus generating inherent compressibility error unavoidably. In the present approach, the pressure field is determined by a pressure-correction method to ensure incompressibility, thus the approach is valid for both liquid and <b>incompressible</b> gas <b>flows.</b> A variety of thermal laminar <b>incompressible</b> <b>flows,</b> such as Couette flow, falling thin liquid film flow, fluid flow through porous plates, and two- and three-dimensional natural convection flow are simulated.

25|$|Fanno flow {{refers to}} {{adiabatic}} flow through a constant area duct where {{the effect of}} friction is considered. Compressibility effects often come into consideration, although the Fanno flow model certainly also applies to <b>incompressible</b> <b>flow.</b> For this model, the duct area remains constant, the flow {{is assumed to be}} steady and one-dimensional, and no mass is added within the duct. The Fanno flow model is considered an irreversible process due to viscous effects. The viscous friction causes the flow properties to change along the duct. The frictional effect is modeled as a shear stress at the wall acting on the fluid with uniform properties over any cross section of the duct.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the theory}} of aerodynamics, a flow is {{considered}} to be compressible if the density changes along a streamline. This means that – unlike <b>incompressible</b> <b>flow</b> – changes in density are considered. In general, this is the case where the Mach number in part or all of the flow exceeds 0.3. The Mach 0.3 value is rather arbitrary, but it is used because gas flows with a Mach number below that value demonstrate changes in density of less than 5%. Furthermore, that maximum 5% density change occurs at the stagnation point (the point on the object where flow speed is zero), while the density changes around the rest of the object will be significantly lower. Transonic, supersonic, and hypersonic flows are all compressible flows.|$|E
25|$|Liquids {{have little}} {{compress}}ibility. Water, for example, will compress by only 46.4 {{parts per million}} for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At around 4000 bar (58,000 psi) of pressure, at room temperature, water only experiences an 11% decrease in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying <b>incompressible</b> <b>flow.</b> This incompressible nature makes a liquid suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, because {{very little of the}} energy is lost in the form of compression. However, the very slight compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The banging of pipes, called water hammer, occurs when a valve is suddenly closed, creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's incompressibility is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity they can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or a dramatic change in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a sharp corner in a pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding any adjacent solid surface.|$|E

Using an order of magnitude analysis, the well-known governing Navier–Stokes equations of viscous fluid flow can be greatly simplified within the boundary layer. Notably, the characteristic of the partial differential equations (PDE) becomes parabolic, rather than the elliptical form of the full Navier–Stokes equations. This greatly simplifies the solution of the equations. By making the boundary layer approximation, the flow is divided into an inviscid portion (which is easy to solve by a number of methods) and the boundary layer, which is governed by an easier to solve PDE.
