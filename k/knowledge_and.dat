5|$|In the yeshiva world, the {{brightest}} students are highly desirable as chavrusas. However, there are {{pros and cons}} to learning with chavrusas who are stronger, weaker, or equal in <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> ability to the student. A stronger chavrusa will correct and fill in the student's <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> help him improve his learning techniques, acting more like a teacher. With a chavrusa who is equal in <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> ability, the student is forced to prove his point with logic rather than by right of seniority, which improves his ability to think logically, analyze other people's opinions objectively, and accept criticism. With a weaker chavrusa, who often worries over and questions each step, the student is forced to understand the material thoroughly, refine and organize his thoughts in a logical structure, present his viewpoint clearly, {{and be ready to}} justify each and every point. The stronger chavrusa helps the student acquire a great deal of information, but the weaker chavrusa helps the student learn how to learn. Yeshiva students are usually advised to have one of each of these three types of chavrusas in order to develop on all three levels.|$|E

He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the <b>knowledge</b> (<b>and</b> ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between <b>knowledge</b> <b>and</b> power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E

The postcolonial discourse analysis revealed several key presuppositions of modern Western (Eurocentric) discourses in the curriculum guide. The construction of “science” and “scientific literacy” revealed assumptions characteristic of modern Western science, while “Indigenous <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> ways of knowing” were paradoxically constructed as commensurable with but other than “science. ” These findings demonstrate that Indigenous <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> ways of knowing are misunderstood in the curriculum guide. Moreover, the research suggests that thematic content may provide a better point of entry for the integration of Indigenous <b>knowledges</b> <b>and</b> ways of knowing into mainstream science programs than specific knowledge content (which may not necessarily cross cultural borders). This indicates the need to reconsider the development of multicultural science curricula across culturally diverse borders...|$|R
