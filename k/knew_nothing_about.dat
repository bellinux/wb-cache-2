5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had {{time and money to}} make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that he <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|The project faced {{multiple}} hurdles, which forced its temporary abandonment. The political {{tensions and}} communal rioting surrounding India's 1947 partition and independence stalled production. Shortly after partition, Shiraz Ali migrated to Pakistan, leaving Asif without a financier. The actor Chandra Mohan {{suffered a heart}} attack and died in 1949. Shiraz Ali had previously suggested that business tycoon Shapoorji Pallonji could finance the film. Although Pallonji <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> film production, in 1950 he agreed to produce the film because of his interest in the history of Akbar. Production was then restarted with a new cast.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaders of}} the strike, {{including}} McMenamin and Carney, were charged in federal court under the SmithConnally Act; some thirty strikers were also indicted later. The federal grand jury was convened on August 9 and heard testimony for two months. However, the grand jury returned inconclusive findings; their report stated {{that most of the}} striking workers <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the strike at the start, and blamed a few instigators for escalating the situation, but did not detail the instigators' activities. The report was also critical of the PTC's response to the strike, characterizing it as inadequate and ineffective. The government dropped its charges against the defendants on March 12, 1945, with most of them pleading nolo contendere and receiving a fine of $100 each.|$|E

And because they have been raised as not even atheists, they don’t {{rise to the level of}} atheists, insofar as they’ve never thought about the existence or nonexistence of God.

5|$|The {{music for}} The 3rd Birthday was {{composed}} by Mitsuto Suzuki and Tsuyoshi Sekito, with additional work by Yoko Shimomura. Shimomura was involved {{from an early}} stage, when The 3rd Birthday was still a mobile game. When she was originally asked to compose for the title, she was involved {{with a number of}} other projects which made handling the entire score difficult. When asked whether she wanted to work with anyone on the composition, she suggested Suzuki and Sekito. The general instruction was to follow the pattern used by the music for Parasite Eve, with Suzuki and Sekito handling the majority of tracks, going so far as referring to the songs from the original Parasite Eve when handling remixes of old themes. In keeping with the game's other development goals, Shimomura wanted to alter some of the established music, although she asked the team to include familiar themes from earlier games for fans. When she started out, she <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the game's story, but became familiar with it later in development and also found the project less challenging than she initially anticipated. Suzuki was responsible for a large amount of track mixing. Sekito was mostly involved with choosing and helping with instrumentation, in particular whether to include symphonic music. The composers had a relatively high degree of freedom, but they also had problems when composing some tracks that did not fit into selected scenes.|$|E

Although the highest levels of government ordered an immediate mobilization, the ministers of the Norwegian government <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the details of mobilization, which were left totally to the Ministry of Defence. Since the Minister of Defence was new to his duties, he deferred this action to his Commander-in Chief, General Kristian Laake.|$|E

The doctor suggested stopping breast-feeding and switch to juice which she did. The next day he started having seizures and convulsions.|$|E

The emperor liked the wine, and later asked Yan Song about it, who was quite surprised and had to confess that he <b>knew</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the wine. Yan almost severed relations with Zhao Wenhua for this transgression if not for the good words by Yan's wife. In another incident, Zhao Wenhua was so drunk that he failed to bow and kneel when receiving a gift from the emperor.|$|E
