25|$|Whenever possible, social psychologists rely on {{controlled}} experimentation. Controlled experiments {{require the}} manipulation {{of one or more}} independent variables in order to examine the effect on a dependent variable. Experiments are useful in social psychology because they are high in <b>internal</b> <b>validity,</b> meaning that they are free from the influence of confounding or extraneous variables, and so are more likely to accurately indicate a causal relationship. However, the small samples used in controlled experiments are typically low in external validity, or {{the degree to which the}} results can be generalized to the larger population. There is usually a trade-off between experimental control (<b>internal</b> <b>validity)</b> and being able to generalize to the population (external validity).|$|E
25|$|External {{validity}} {{pertains to}} the process of generalizing the findings of the study to the population from which the sample was drawn (or even beyond that population to a more universal statement). This requires an understanding of which conditions are relevant (or irrelevant) to the generalization. <b>Internal</b> <b>validity</b> is clearly a prerequisite for external validity.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The SRS- 24 {{questionnaire}} was originally validated using methods of classical test theory, but <b>internal</b> construct <b>validity</b> {{has never been}} shown. <b>Internal</b> construct <b>validity,</b> i. e. unidimensionality and linearity, is a fundamental arithmetic requirement {{and needs to be}} shown for a scale for summating any set of Likert-type items. Here, <b>internal</b> construct <b>validity</b> of the SRS- 24 questionnaire in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients is analyzed. METHODS: 232 SRS- 24 questionnaires distributed to 116 patients with AIS pre-operatively and at postoperative follow-up were analyzed. 103 patients were females; the average age was 16. 5 ± 7. 1 years. The questionnaires were subjected to Rasch analysis using the RUMM 2020 software package. RESULTS: All seven domains of the SRS- 24 showed misfit to the Rasch model, and three of seven were unidimensional. Unidimensionality and linearity could only be achieved for an aggregate score by separating pre- and postoperative items and omitting items which caused model misfit. Reducing the questionnaire to six pre-operative items (p = 0. 098; 2. 25...|$|R
25|$|Critics of the BCS National Championship {{argued against}} the <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> of a {{so-called}} national championship being {{awarded to the}} winner of a single postseason game. Critics lamented that the participants were selected based upon polls, computer rankings, popularity and human biases, and not by on-field competition, as in other major sports and all other levels of college football, which employed tournament-format championships. Often, the BCS system led to controversies in which multiple teams finished the season with identical records, and voters distinguished the worthiness of {{their participation in the}} BCS National Championship with no set of formal criteria or standards. The end of the 2010 season {{was one of the best}} examples of this. Without any objective criteria for evaluation of the teams, the BCS forced voters to impose their own standards and tiebreakers. Critics noted that the system inherently fostered selection bias, and therefore lacked both <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> and external validity.|$|E
25|$|Fredikson, Sundin, and Frankenhaeuser (1985) {{found that}} {{reactions}} to psychological stressors include increased {{activity in the}} brain axes which {{play an important role}} in the regulation of blood pressure, particularly ambulatory blood pressure. A meta-analysis and systematic review involving 29 samples linked job strain to elevated ambulatory blood pressure. Belkić et al. (2000) found that many of the 30 studies covered in their review revealed that decision latitude and psychological workload exerted independent effects on CVD; two studies found synergistic effects, consistent with the strictest version of the demand-control model. A review of 17 longitudinal studies having reasonably high <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> found that 8 showed a significant relation between the combination of low latitude and high workload (the job strain condition) and CVD and 3 more showed a nonsignificant relation. The findings, however, were clearer for men than for women, on whom data were more sparse. In a massive (n > 197,000) longitudinal study that combined data from 13 independent studies, Kivimäki et al. (2012) found that, controlling for other risk factors, the combination of high levels of demands and low control at baseline increased the risk of CVD in initially healthy workers by between 20 and 30% over a follow-up period that averaged 7.5 years. In this study the effects were similar for men and women.|$|E

30|$|Based on the {{taxonomy}} in [44], {{there are four}} potential validity threat areas, namely: external, construct, <b>internal,</b> and conclusion <b>validity.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>validity</b> is the {{approximate}} truth about inferences regarding cause-effect or causal relationships. This is why validity {{is important for}} quasi experiments because they are all about causal relationships. It occurs when the experimenter tries to control all variables that could affect {{the results of the}} experiment. Statistical regression, history and the participants are all possible threats to <b>internal</b> <b>validity.</b> The question you would want to ask while trying to keep <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> high is [...] "Are there any other possible reasons for the outcome besides the reason I want it to be?" [...] If so, then <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> might not be as strong.|$|E
50|$|Any {{effect that}} can impact the <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> of a {{research}} study may bias the results and impact the validity of statistical conclusions reached. These threats to <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> include unreliability of treatment implementation (lack of standardization) or failing to control for extraneous variables.|$|E

30|$|The {{external}} {{consistency of}} embedded real-time transactions requires that each transaction {{is in its}} <b>validity</b> <b>internal,</b> and all read/write operations are within its validity interval.|$|R
50|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>validity</b> {{refers to}} the extent to which a set of {{research}} findings provides compelling information about causality. High <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> implies that the experimental design of a study excludes extraneous influences, such that one can confidently conclude that variations in the independent variable caused any observed changes in the dependent variable.|$|E
50|$|On first glance, {{internal}} and external validity seem to contradict each other - to get an experimental design you have to control for all interfering variables. That is why you often conduct your experiment in a laboratory setting. While gaining <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> (excluding interfering variables by keeping them constant) you lose ecological or external validity because you establish an artificial laboratory setting. On the other hand, with observational research you can not control for interfering variables (low <b>internal</b> <b>validity)</b> but you can measure in the natural (ecological) environment, {{at the place where}} behavior normally occurs. However, in doing so, you sacrifice <b>internal</b> <b>validity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{the realm}} of {{empirical}} research, investigators are first and foremost concerned with the validity of their results, but validity is a multi-dimensional ideal. In this article we discuss two key dimensions of <b>validity</b> – <b>internal</b> and external <b>validity</b> – and underscore the natural tension that arises in choosing a research approach to maximize both types of validity. We propose that the most common approaches to empirical research – the use of naturally-occurring field/market data {{and the use of}} laboratory experiments – fall on the ends of a spectrum of research approaches, and that the interior of this spectrum includes intermediary approaches such as field experiments and natural experiments. Furthermore, we argue that choosing between lab experiments and field data usually requires a tradeoff between the pursuit of <b>internal</b> and external <b>validity.</b> Movements toward the interior of the spectrum can often ease the tension between <b>internal</b> and external <b>validity</b> but are also accompanied by other important limitations, such as less control over subject matter or topic areas and a reduced ability for others to replicate research. Finally, we highlight recent attempts to modify and mix research approaches in a way that eases the natural conflict between <b>internal</b> and external <b>validity</b> and discuss if employing multiple methods leads to economies of scope in research costs...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) {{measure is}} {{recommended}} {{to evaluate the}} quality of care. However, {{there is no evidence}} that it is valid in rehabilitation. Aims were to examine the <b>internal</b> construct (factorial) <b>validity</b> of the CARE in the assessment of the patient-therapist relationship. Method: CARE data were part of an experimental study of acupuncture and different currently used acupuncture placebo controls, including 213 patients (age 66. 8, SD 8. 3, 58 % female) with chronic stable hip or knee pain of mechanical origin, waiting for a joint replacement. CARE was completed two weeks into the study and on completion, two weeks later. Data analysis: Cronbach alpha, factor analysis and Rasch analysis. Results: <b>Internal</b> construct <b>validity</b> was supported (82 % of variance explained by the first factor; fit to the Rasch model χ(2) [*]=[*] 18. 2, P[*]=[*] 0. 57). CARE was unidimensional, had local independence of items, good item fit, absence of Differential Item Functioning and invariance over time. Three percent of people did not complete items 9 & 10. Conclusions: CARE satisfied strict criteria for <b>internal</b> construct <b>validity.</b> An interval scale transformation is available that can be used in clinical practice and research. Further work is required to investigate item non-response and how this may be dealt with in clinical settings. [Box: see text]...|$|R

50|$|The {{apparent}} contradiction of <b>internal</b> <b>validity</b> {{and external}} validity is, however, only superficial. The {{question of whether}} results from a particular study generalize to other people, places or times arises only when one follows an inductivist research strategy.

50|$|<b>Internal</b> <b>validity</b> is an {{inductive}} {{estimate of}} the degree to which conclusions about causal relationships can be made (e.g. cause and effect), based on the measures used, the research setting, and the whole research design.

Furthermore, the analyzed systems were developed by teams of different sizes and with different levels of software development skills.
