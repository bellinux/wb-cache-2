5000|$|The term [...] "biodegradable plastic" [...] {{has also}} been used by {{producers}} of specially modified petrochemical-based plastics that appear to biodegrade. Biodegradable plastic bag manufacturers that have misrepresented their product's biodegradability may now face legal action in the US state of California for the misleading use of the terms biodegradable or compostable. Traditional plastics such as polyethylene are degraded by ultra-violet (UV) light and oxygen. To prevent this, process manufacturers add stabilising chemicals. However, {{with the addition of}} a degradation initiator to the plastic, it is possible to achieve a controlled UV/oxidation disintegration process. This type of plastic may be referred to as <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> or oxy-degradable plastic or photodegradable plastic because the process is not initiated by microbial action. While some degradable plastics manufacturers argue that degraded plastic residue will be attacked by microbes, these degradable materials do not meet the requirements of the EN13432 commercial composting standard. The bioplastics industry has widely criticized oxo-biodegradable plastics, which the industry association says do not meet its requirements. Oxo-biodegradable plastics - known as [...] "oxos" [...] - are conventional petroleum-based products with some additives that initiate degradation. The ASTM standard for oxo-biodegradables is called the Standard Guide for Exposing and Testing Plastics that Degrade in the Environment by a Combination of Oxidation and Biodegradation (ASTM 6954). Both EN 13432 and ASTM 6400 are specifically designed for PLA and Starch based products and should not be used as a guide for oxos.|$|E

The objective of this field experiment is to evaluate the effect of two thicknesses of polyactic acid-degradable film on soil temperature and cotton yield. The results showed that small holes appeared in the polyactic acid-degradable film at 17 ~ 22 d after it was installed. Burst period appeared about 60 d after installation. Splits were observed in the polyactic acid-degradable film at 130 d after installation. Soil temperatures rose slowly under polyactic acid-degradable film during the cotton seedling stage. Daytime soil temperatures were 0. 8 ℃ and 6. 2 ℃ lower under 18 μm and 15 μm thick polyactic acid-degradable film than non-degradable plastic film(CK), respectively.

40|$|Plastic waste {{constitutes}} {{the third largest}} waste volume in Malaysian municipal solid waste (MSW), next to putrescible waste and paper. The plastic component in MSW from Kuala Lumpur averages 24 % (by weight), whereas the national mean is about 15 %. The 144 waste dumps in the country receive about 95 % of the MSW, including plastic waste. The useful life of the landfills is fast diminishing as the plastic waste stays un-degraded for more than 50 years. In this study the compostability of polyethylene and pro-oxidant additive-based environmentally degradable plastics (EDP) was investigated. Linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) samples exposed hydrolytically or oxidatively at 60 degrees C showed that the abiotic degradation path was oxidative rather than hydrolytic. There was a weight loss of 8 % and the plastic has been oxidized {{as shown by the}} additional carbonyl group exhibited in the Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) Spectrum. Oxidation rate seemed to be influenced by the amount of pro-oxidant additive, the chemical structure and morphology of the plastic samples, and the surface area. Composting studies during a 45 -day experiment showed that the percentage elongation (reduction) was 20 % for McD samples [high-density polyethylene, (HDPE) with 3 % additive] and LL samples (LLDPE with 7 % additive) and 18 % reduction for totally <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> (TDP) samples (HDPE with 3 % additive).

40|$|Cocoa pod borer (CPB; Conopomorpha cramerella) and Phytophthora pod rot (PPR; Phytophthora palmivora) {{are serious}} pest and disease on cocoa {{plantations}} in Indonesia. Both pest and disease have been controlled with limited success using cultural {{practices such as}} pruning, frequent harvesting, sanitation, plastic sleeving, and chemical pesticides. An experiment was conducted on cocoa plantings in Pinrang Regency, South Sulawesi during the wet season of 2008 / 09 to test the effect of pod sleeving (with transparent degradable and non-degradable plastic bags) and nematode application on CPB and PPR infestation. The nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae (10, 000 active juveniles per pod) was sprayed three times at intervals of 10 and 20 days. Pod damage by CPB was observed at harvest time, while PPR disease incidence was evaluated every week until harvest time. Results showed that all pods in the field were infested by CPB as indicated in control samples. Pod sleeving using both non-degradable and degradable plastics significantly reduced pod damage by CPB, from 62. 3 % in the control treatment compared to 8. 4 % in the CPB treatment. A combination of pod sleeving and nematode application had a synergistic reduction of pod damage by CPB resulting in totally healthy pods. Pod sleeving with degradable and non-degradable plastics also reduced pod damage by PPR significantly. Pod sleeving with non-degradable plastic suppressed the disease incidence almost zero until 6 weeks after sleeving {{and the rate of}} disease incidence was 3. 6 % per week. However, with <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic,</b> the disease suppression was even longer (7 weeks after sleeving), indicating that the <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> is more effective.

40|$|Organic {{fruit and}} {{vegetable}} growing is increasing world-wide, but knowledge concerning best practice is generally empirical rather than field-based. This thesis extends knowledge concerning best practice in Swedish organic strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa (Duch)) production, which is usually based on a two-year crop. A series of four field experiments were conducted at Rånna Experimental Station (58 ° 27 ’N, 13 ° 51 ’E) on the strawberry cultivars ‘Honeoye’, ‘Cavendish’ and ‘Korona’. Specific objectives were to investigate: the effects of different organic fertilisers combined with <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> mulch on plant establishment, yield and nitrogen mineralisation in soil; the efficiency of biological pest control using a predatory mite against strawberry mites (Phytonemus pallidus); innate within-field dispersal capacity of strawberry mite; the effects of pyrethrum combined with fleece covering on damage by strawberry blossom weevil (Anthonomus rubi). Plant establishment measured as fruit yield was improved by 60 % when <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> mulch was used, probably through more flowers being initiated. Additional applications of organic fertiliser during the cropping period {{had little effect on}} yield. Biological control using the predatory mite Neoseiulus cucumeris reduced strawberry mite populations by up to 50 % but there was no increase in yield. It was difficult to draw clear conclusions from the strawberry mite dispersal pilot study, but mites tended to move more easily along planted rows than between rows. Pyrethrum alone had no visible effect on flower bud damage by strawberry blossom weevil but when combined with fleece covering it reduced the number of ‘Honeoye’ buds damaged by weevils by approximately 10 %. This was followed by a corresponding increase in cultivar yield. Similar effects were not recorded in the other cultivar examined. The study identified the following practical consequences for organic strawberry production: • Choice of pest-resistant cultivars is extremely important for success. • Use of clean plants and an efficient predatory species is essential in controlling mite infestations. • Use of <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> mulching is recommended. • Fleece covering is recommended for protecting some cultivars against strawberry blossom weevils. • Only an initial starter fertilisation is required. • Use of pyrethrum is not recommended...|$|E

ANFIS {{is made up of}} a multilayer feedforward network that comprises of two important elements in soft computing namely the neural network learning algorithm and fuzzy reasoning which provides smoothness in data processing. However, the weight determined by the first three layers of ANFIS causes inconsistencies in coefficient signs with underlying monotonic relations thus making it impossible to represent known monotonic relations. Hence the objective of this research is to find an alternative method among the AHP techniques of determining the weights to be supplied to the back-propagation layers of ANFIS. Lambda-Max technique has been identified to be the most suitable weight determination technique due to its simple calculation and precision of weights obtained. The newly developed Lambda-Max ANFIS is then used to predict the physical properties of <b>degradable</b> <b>plastics</b> using real life data obtained from the laboratory of the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB). Bootstrapping resampling technique was applied to the data and consistency index measurement was carried out to ensure the suitability of the data prior to the model development. The system is capable to identify the most suitable input predictor sets based on the values of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R and R. The prediction ability of the Lambda-Max ANFIS is compared to the prediction accuracy of the conventional ANFIS. Both the Lambda-Max and conventional ANFIS were found to exhibit significantly similar high prediction accuracies. Predicted output of Lambda-Max ANFIS was also compared to the output of MPOB laboratories. The results show that Lambda-Max gives highly similar prediction output with the actual laboratory output. On top of that, Lambda-Max outputs are highly consistent for any given input combination.

40|$|Plastic {{pollution}} {{is a significant}} problem due to the longevity of plastic; {{the seriousness of the}} threat has been severely underestimated and only recently recognised as a major concern for the marine environment; threatening the survival of marine wildlife. This thesis investigated the degradation rates of degradable and conventional non <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> bag samples; to compare the impact of each plastic on the marine environment. Plastic samples were exposed to 1, 2 and 5 hours of ultraviolet light under simulated marine conditions, in the laboratory for 4 weeks; by analysing signs of physical and chemical degradation; measuring tensile strength; and observing chemical degradation using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results of the FT-IR spectroscopy yielded no significant change in the plastics molecular structure. Significant changes were observed in the tensile strength results; all the samples had a greater tensile strength {{at the beginning of the}} study; decreasing as the degree of ultraviolet exposure increased from 1 to 5 hours. No physical signs of degradation such as fragmentation or colour change were observed; except the samples weight decreased periodically each week. The study concludes that <b>degradable</b> <b>plastic</b> bag samples degrade to a greater extent than conventional non degradable samples. If this rate of degradation continues, the plastic will totally degrade; reducing the amount of plastic pollution in the marine environment; but while the plastic is degrading, it will still pose an issue to wildlife.

New fermentation strategies have been developed for the efficient production of PHAs at high concentration and productivity. With the current advances, PHAs can now be produced to a concentration of 80 g L? 1 with productivities greater than 4 g PHA L? 1 h? 1. These advances will further lower the production cost of PHAs and allow this family of polymers to become a leading biodegradable polymer in the near future. This review describes the properties of PHAs, their uses, the various attempts towards the production of PHAs, focusing on the utilization of cheap substrates and the development of different fermentation strategies for the production of these polymers, an essential step forward towards their widespread use.
