40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s, {{significant}} advancement {{in the safety}} of ifosfamide therapy was achieved by co-administrating mesna (sodium 2 -mercaptoethane sulfonate) to prevent dose-limiting hemorrhagic cystitis. Mesna exerts its protective effect within the urine, where its free sulfhydryl group is able to conjugate cytotoxic metabolites. Within the circulation, however, mesna exists primarily as its inactive disulfide, <b>dimesna.</b> <b>Dimesna</b> is currently undergoing clinical development as a prodrug (BNP 7787) to treat cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity. Remarkably, chemoprotection is achieved without attenuation of efficacy of co-administered anti-cancer agents. This is widely attributed to the kidney-specific disposition and stability of <b>dimesna.</b> We sought to evaluate the role of drug transporters in the disposition of <b>dimesna.</b> In vitro screens of uptake and efflux transporters identified putative mechanisms of apical and basolateral uptake of <b>dimesna</b> and subsequent secretion of mesna into renal tubules. Administration of the renal drug transporter inhibitor probenecid to healthy subjects significantly increased combined mesna and <b>dimesna</b> plasma exposure while decreasing the renal clearance due to secretion and steady-state volume of distribution. Chemical reduction of <b>dimesna</b> to mesna is essential for the mitigation of ifosfamide- and cisplatin-induced toxicities. In vitro, reduction of <b>dimesna</b> was facilitated by redox enzymes of the thioredoxin and glutaredoxin systems and also by non-enzymatic thiol-disulfide exchange with cysteine and glutathione. These findings supported the further investigation of mesna as a thiol exchange agent to lower the toxic endogenous thiol amino acid homocysteine (Hcy). Increased plasma total homocysteine (tHcy) is a graded, independent risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Over 90 % of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have elevated plasma tHcy. Previous studies have expanded the use of mesna to exchange with albumin-bound Hcy, thereby enhancing its dialytic clearance. Although an initial pilot study of 12 mg/kg intravenous mesna administered predialysis caused a significant decrease in plasma tHcy compared to placebo, prolonged treatment had no effect on plasma tHcy. Successful therapeutic uses of mesna and <b>dimesna</b> are likely due to their unique disposition by renal drug transporters and thiol-disulfide redox equilibrium. Loss of renal transporter function due to disease, drug-drug interactions, or genetic variability may decrease their therapeutic efficacy...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{transport}} and reduction of <b>dimesna</b> (NA- 2 -mercaptoethane sulfonate disulfide) was studied in vitro using isolated, perfused rat kidney, and isolated renal epithelial cells. Cellular uptake of <b>dimesna</b> {{was found to}} be dependent on an active transport mechanism working across the luminal brush border, with an app. Km of ∼ 22 μM and Vmax ∼ 1. 4 nmol. 106 cells− 1. min− 1. Among other low molecular thiols or disulfides reduced glutathione was the only one to exert competitive inhibition. γ-GT-activity or cellular GSH status had no influence on renal uptake of <b>dimesna,</b> but the intracellular reduction rate was dependent on access to reduced glutathione as a cofactor...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of mesna (sodium 2 -mercaptoethane sulphonate) and its inactive disulphide, <b>dimesna,</b> {{were investigated}} using high performance liquid chromatography in six normal subjects following intravenous and oral administration of 800 mg mesna. The mean maximum mesna concentration after i. v. administration was 111 (s. d. +/- 28. 3) nmol ml- 1 {{and the mean}} maximum <b>dimesna</b> concentration was 183 (s. d. +/- 41. 6) nmol ml- 1. Following oral mesna dosing the mean peak mesna concentration was 19. 6 (s. d. +/- 10. 2) nmol ml- 1 but mesna was only found in the plasma of {{five of the six}} subjects. The mean peak <b>dimesna</b> concentration was 22. 5 (s. d. +/- 12. 4) nmol ml- 1. Following i. v. mesna administration, the mean half-life of mesna was 21. 8 (s. d. +/- 3. 1) min and total body clearance 1. 23 (s. d. +/- 0. 31) l kg- 1 h- 1. The mean half-life of <b>dimesna</b> was 1. 17 (s. d. +/- 0. 32) h. It was not possible to determine their half-lives after oral mesna administration. The mean mesna concentration in the 0 - 4 h urine collection was 9. 6 (s. d. +/- 10. 7; range 1. 4 - 28. 7) nmol ml- 1 following i. v. mesna injection. After oral mesna the highest mesna concentration occurred in either the 0 - 4 or 4 - 8 h urine collections. The mean peak mesna concentration was 2. 5 (s. d. +/- 1. 7) mumol ml- 1 (c. f. estimated uroprotective concentration of 1. 7 mumol ml- 1). The mean 4 h urinary clearance of the uroprotective species mesna was 0. 413 (s. d. +/- 0. 136) l kg- 1 h- 1. After both i. v. and oral mesna the urinary excretion of mesna is predominantly during the first 4 h. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|In hyperhomocysteinemic patients, after {{reaction}} with homocysteine-albumin mixed disulfides (HSS-ALB), mesna (MSH) {{forms the}} mixed disulfide with Hcy (HSSM) {{which can be}} removed by renal clearance, thus reducing the plasma concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy). In order to assess the HSS-ALB dethiolation via thiol exchange reactions, the distribution of redox species of cysteine, cysteinylglycine, homocysteine and glutathione was investigated in the plasma of healthy subjects: (i) in vitro, after addition of 35 μM reduced homocysteine (HSH) to plasma for 72 h, followed by MSH addition (at the concentration range 10 - 600 μM) for 25 min; (ii) in vivo, after oral treatment with methionine (methionine, 200 mg/kg body weight, observation time 2 - 6 h). In both experiments the distribution of redox species, but not {{the total amount of}} each thiol, was modified by thiol exchange reactions of albumin and cystine, with changes thermodynamically related to the pKa values of thiols in the corresponding mixed disulfides. MSH provoked a dose-response reversal of the redox state of aged plasma, and the thiol action was confirmed by in vivo experiments. Since it was observed that the <b>dimesna</b> production could be detrimental for the in vivo optimization of HSSM formation, we assume that the best plasma tHcy lowering can be obtained at MSH doses producing the minimum <b>dimesna</b> concentration in each individual...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Expression systems {{based on}} self-cleavable intein domains allow the {{generation}} of recombinant proteins with a C-terminal thioester. This uniquely reactive C-terminus {{can be used in}} native chemical ligation reactions to introduce synthetic groups or to immobilize proteins on surfaces and nanoparticles. Unfortunately, common refolding procedures for recombinant proteins that contain disulfide bonds do not preserve the thioester functionality and therefore novel refolding procedures need to be developed. Results A novel redox buffer consisting of MESNA and <b>diMESNA</b> showed a refolding efficiency comparable to that of GSH/GSSG and prevented loss of the protein's thioester functionality. Moreover, introduction of the MESNA/diMESNA redox couple in the cleavage buffer allowed simultaneous on-column refolding of Ribonuclease A and intein-mediated cleavage to yield Ribonuclease A with a C-terminal MESNA-thioester. The C-terminal thioester was shown to be active in native chemical ligation. Conclusion An efficient method was developed for the production of disulfide bond containing proteins with C-terminal thioesters. Introduction of a MESNA/diMESNA redox couple resulted in simultaneous on-column refolding, purification and thioester generation of the model protein Ribonuclease A. </p...|$|E
40|$|Renal Fanconi {{syndrome}} {{occurs in}} about 1 - 5 % {{of all children}} treated with Ifosfamide (Ifo) and impairment of renal phosphate reabsorption in about 20 - 30 % of them. Pathophysiological mechanisms of Ifo-induced nephropathy are ill defined. The aim has been to investigate whether Ifo metabolites affect the type IIa sodium-dependent phosphate transporter (NaPi-IIa) in viable opossum kidney cells. Ifo did not influence viability of cells or NaPi-IIa-mediated transport up to 1 mM/ 24 h. Incubation of confluent cells with chloroacetaldehyde (CAA) and 4 -hydroperoxyIfosfamide (4 -OH-Ifo) led to cell death by necrosis in a concentration-dependent manner. At low concentrations (50 - 100 microM/ 24 h), cell viability was normal but apical phosphate transport, NaPi-IIa protein, and -mRNA expression were significantly reduced. Coincubation with sodium- 2 -mercaptoethanesulfonate (MESNA) prevented the inhibitory action of CAA but not of 4 -OH-Ifo; <b>DiMESNA</b> had no effect. Incubation with Ifosfamide-mustard (Ifo-mustard) did alter cell viability at concentrations above 500 microM/ 24 h. At lower concentrations (50 - 100 microM/ 24 h), it led to significant reduction in phosphate transport, NaPi-IIa protein, and mRNA expression. MESNA did not block these effects. The effect of Ifo-mustard was due to internalization of NaPi-IIa. Cyclophosphamide-mustard (CyP-mustard) {{did not have any}} influence on cell survival up to 1000 microM, but the inhibitory effect on phosphate transport and on NaPi-IIa protein was the same as found after Ifo-mustard. In conclusion, CAA, 4 -OH-Ifo, and Ifo- and CyP-mustard are able to inhibit sodium-dependent phosphate cotransport in viable opossum kidney cells. The Ifo-mustard effect took place via internalization and reduction of de novo synthesis of NaPi-IIa. Therefore, it is possible that Ifo-mustard {{plays an important role in}} pathogenesis of Ifo-induced nephropathy...|$|E
