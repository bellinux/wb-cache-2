5|$|Celtic secured their {{progress}} to the knock-out {{stages of the}} Champions League on 5 December 2012 with a 21 home win over Spartak Moscow, Kris Commons scoring the winning goal in 82 minutes with a penalty. Celtic were drawn against Juventus but succumbed to 50 aggregate defeat in the Spring of 2013 to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament. Despite the emphatic scoreline over the two legs, Celtic were not outclassed by their Italian opponents in terms of general play but while Juventus defended with a ruthless defiance, Celtic in contrast shipped their goals all far too easily. Despite the result against Juventus, Celtic and Neil Lennon won praise for their Champions League campaign.|$|E
5|$|Collingwood {{was fined}} £1000 during the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship {{when he visited}} a lap-dancing club prior to England's match with New Zealand. Collingwood led the team to victory over Zimbabwe in the group stages of the tournament, but England, under his leadership, were later {{defeated}} by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition before the final stages. During England's subsequent tour of Sri Lanka Collingwood led the team to victory in the ODI Series. In the later Test series, he became the 709th Test wicket of Muttiah Muralitharan, who thus overtook Shane Warne as the highest Test wicket taker.|$|E

United also fell behind in the title race for the third {{consecutive}} season, finishing in 5th place, in spite of several expensive signings during Van Gaal's tenure. However, that same season, Manchester United won the FA Cup for a 12th time. Despite this victory, Van Gaal was sacked as manager just two days later, with José Mourinho appointed in his place on 27 May, signing a three-year contract. That season, United finished in sixth place while winning the EFL Cup for the fifth time and the Europa League for the first time, as well as the FA Community Shield for a record 21st time. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal with United, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as United's all-time top scorer, before leaving the club {{at the end of the}} season to return to Everton.|$|E

5|$|The name of Sejanus {{continued}} to be pressed into political service during the 18th century. Prime Minister Robert Walpole was attacked in 1735 {{in the course of}} a popular skit, C----- and country: A play of seven acts...the whole concluding with the grand masque, call'd, The downfall of Sejanus; its authorship is attributed to 'a masquerader' and in the printed version the masque precedes the play, although it is performed last. This gives the clue of how to take what is to follow and consists of a conversation between Punch and the Hangman, opening with the question 'Is this same Sejanus to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World like a Man, or to die the Death of a mad Dog? For he has lived like a sad One, from the first Day that the Emperor Tiberius took him into Favour.' A subtler attack on a later prime minister occurred in 1769 when Jonson's Sejanus was reissued under the title of The Favourite. This was prefaced with a tongue-in-cheek dedication to Lord Bute, denying that there can be any comparison between the conduct of Sejanus and that of his lordship.|$|E

25|$|After Franco Baresi's {{international}} {{retirement in}} 1994, Maldini was appointed the team's full-time captain. A disappointing Euro 1996 campaign would see Italy eliminated {{in the group}} stage with four points, in a group which contained the two eventual finalists of the tournament, Germany and the Czech Republic. Maldini played in all three of Italy's group matches. The 1998 World Cup in France would see Italy start strongly, topping their group. Maldini played in all five of Italy's matches, and started the play that led to Christian Vieri's opening goal in Italy's first match against Chile, which ended in a 2–2 draw. Maldini, partnering with Alessandro Costacurta, Fabio Cannavaro, Alessandro Nesta and Giuseppe Bergomi, would also help Italy to keep clean sheets in the second group match against Cameroon, the round of 16 match Norway and France in the quarter-finals, but Italy would eventually <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament to the hosts and eventual champions on penalties, {{for the third consecutive}} time in a World Cup.|$|E
25|$|Patriarchy {{is related}} to {{institutionalized}} control, and not merely people’s individual sexism. Much {{research has been done}} to understand why females are stereotypically believed to occupy a domestic character while males are projected to pursue qualified fulfillment outside of the household. Patriarchal structures of discrimination and oppression historically established male privilege by denying females the right to political involvement, in so doing lessening if not eradicating their chances to contribute in the regulations that circumscribe their life. This disunion of work is often plotted onto a social ladder where men's choice to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> house and assumed control over females is seen as foremost. Although each society has to have headship and control, patriarchy has thoroughly subjected females to manipulation, abuse, and subordination. Traditionally, patriarchy gave the father of the family complete possession over the spouse or wives, children, etc. as well as the ability to perform physical exploitation and every so often even those of manslaughter and auction. In certain cases, the juncture of patriarchy as privilege and authority and conceptual ideas of females as properties can habitually turn out to be established into a “rape culture” where rape and further versions of violence toward females are recognized as a usual part of the social order. For example, from the 1900s into the 2000s, Serbs in Croatia, Kosovo, and Bosnia used rape of females as a usual tactic of combat to chastise and threaten inhabitants seen as lesser. Since the government enacts responsibilities and civil liberties, it increases the inquiry {{of the role of the}} government in gendering progressions.|$|E

2500|$|Opened in 1961, Castle Peak Hospital is the {{psychiatric}} hospital with the longest history in Hong Kong. Most of the wards of the Hospital is [...] "gazetted", {{meaning that the}} wards of the Hospital admit voluntary and involuntary patients under the Mental Health Ordinance. All types of modern psychiatric treatment work are available in hospital, {{including the use of}} drugs and other physical methods of treatment, and psychological and social treatment. Multi-disciplinary teamwork is emphasised in the provision of treatment and care for patients. The recent trend is to put emphasis not only on hospital treatment, but also on community psychiatric care. The Hospital is seeking to provide an integrated service, taking hospital care and community care as complementary to one another. Altogether there are 16 male wards and 11 female wards and 3 mixed sex wards. Patients of open wards can walk about freely within the hospital compound. Many of these patients are undergoing intensive rehabilitation in preparation for discharge and some may <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital in the day time to work during the final stage of their rehabilitation.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{like the}} {{previous}} day's stage, {{there were no}} categorised climbs {{during the day and}} although more undulating than the eighteenth stage, it was still expected to potentially bring about a sprint finish at the end; however, an uphill finish in La Lastrilla made it equally capable of producing a result that would favour some of the puncheurs in the race, like Philippe Gilbert (...) or 's former race leader Joaquim Rodríguez, or even a breakaway to succeed on a rare occasion. Almost from the start, two of the wildcard teams had riders <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peloton and attack off the front, as 's José Vicente Toribio and [...] rider Aitor Galdós initiated the breakaway, quickly mustering a healthy advantage. The duo's advantage went up at a rapid pace, reaching its maximum of over ten minutes less than a quarter into the stage. Several teams took up station {{on the front of the}} main field; some to bring back the gap for the sprinters, while others to set one up for their puncheurs.|$|E

2500|$|At the World Cup {{finals in}} June 2010, Argentina started by winning 1–0 against Nigeria, {{followed}} by a 4–1 victory over South Korea {{on the strength of}} a Gonzalo Higuaín hat-trick. In the final match of the group stage, Argentina won 2–0 against Greece to win the group and advance to a second round, meeting Mexico. After defeating Mexico 3–1, however, Argentina was routed by Germany 4–0 in the quarter-finals to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition. Argentina was ranked fifth in the tournament. After the defeat to Germany, Maradona admitted that he was considering his future as Argentina coach, stating, [...] "I may leave tomorrow."

Afterwards, on 29 July, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams (as well as his former Argentine national team and Sevilla coach) Carlos Bilardo had [...] "lied to", [...] "betrayed" [...] and effectively sacked him from the role.

2500|$|On 4 April, England were {{up against}} Sri Lanka, and {{struggling}} at 133–6, chasing 236 to win. Nixon {{came to the}} crease and crashed 42 off just 44 deliveries, with two 4s and a superb 6, sharing an 87 run partnership with Ravi Bopara off just 15.2 overs, before skying a Lasith Malinga delivery to Mahela Jayawardene. This {{turned out to be}} the best seventh wicket partnership of the whole competition. His 6 came in the form of a fantastic reverse sweep off the bowling of Muttiah Muralitharan. Renowned as one of the best players of the shot, Nixon remarked after the match, [...] "I've probably hit 20 sixes like that in county cricket – if I get my timing right, it's going to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ground". He had taken England to the brink of victory, having arrived at the crease with the team all but defeated. Bopara was left with the task of hitting 3 runs off the last delivery, but was clean bowled by Dilhara Fernando, as Sri Lanka sneaked a 2 run victory. After this innings, Nixon had a World Cup average of 63 – second highest in the England team to Paul Collingwood, but still better than renowned big hitters Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff. The figure placed him in the top twenty batsmen – in terms of average – at the World Cup at this stage, ahead of fellow wicket keepers, Brendon McCullum, Adam Gilchrist, Mark Boucher and Kumar Sangakkara.|$|E
2500|$|The {{account of}} Maudgalyāyana {{looking for his}} mother after her death is widespread. Apart from being used to {{illustrate}} the principles of karmic retribution and rebirth, in China, the story developed a new emphasis. There Maudgalyāyana was known as [...] "Mulian", and his story was taught {{in a mixture of}} religious instruction and entertainment, to remind people of their duties to deceased relatives. Its earliest version being the [...] Sanskrit Ullambana Sutra, the story has been made popular in China, Japan, and Korea through edifying folktales such as the Chinese bianwen (for example, The Transformation Text on Mu-lien Saving His Mother from the Dark Regions). In most versions of the story, Maudgalyāyana uses his psychic powers to look for his deceased parents and see in what world they have been reborn. Although he can find his father in a heaven, he cannot find his mother and asks the Buddha for help. The Buddha brings him to his mother, who is located in a hell realm, but Maudgalyāyana cannot help her. The Buddha then advises him to make merits on his mother's behalf, which helps her to be reborn in a better place. In the Laotian version of the story, he travels to the world of Yama, the ruler of the underworld, only to find the world abandoned. Yama then tells Maudgalyāyana that he allows the denizens of the hell to <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gates of hell to be free for one day, that is, on the full moon day of the ninth lunar month. On this day, the hell beings can receive merit transferred and be liberated from hell, if such merit is transferred to them. In some other Chinese accounts, Maudgalyāyana finds his mother, reborn as a hungry ghost. When Maudgalyāyana tries to offer her food through an ancestral shrine, the food bursts into flames each time. Maudgalyāyana therefore asks the Buddha for advice, who recommends him to make merit to the Saṃgha and transfer it to his mother. The transfer not only helps his mother to be reborn in heaven, but {{can also be used to}} help seven generations of parents and ancestors. The offering was believed to be most effective when collectively done, which led to the arising of the ghost festival.|$|E
