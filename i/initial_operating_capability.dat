The 707s saw active service during operations in Namibia, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan. One of the transport jets was lost in a crash in October 1991. No.33 Squadron relocated to Amberley and was temporarily without aircraft following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008.

40|$|Telecommunications {{is one of}} {{our most}} {{critical}} national infrastructures, enabling many other infrastructure sectors to function. The federal oversight structure for this sector, put in place by the Department of Homeland Security, relies heavily on voluntary cooperation between the public and private sectors. Given that no large-scale disruption of the nationwide telecommunications backbone has occurred, there is no empirical evidence showing the effectiveness of the structure DHS has put in place. In an effort to gauge the effectiveness of the various existing infrastructure oversight structures, this thesis examines four specific roles assumed by the federal government and their performance in their respective sectors. These roles and sectors are Owner (aviation), Customer (power), Coordinator (local telecommunications), and Regulator (food). Each case is reviewed {{to determine the effects of}} the government role on economic impact of the disruption, the time required to restore <b>initial</b> <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities,</b> and the time required to restore full <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities.</b> The various cases show that the government role has little direct impact on the costs related to infrastructure disruptions. The Regulator role had a negative impact on timelines for both initial and full restoration. The other roles all made positive contributions to both restoration timelines.

In 2005, PAC began manufacturing JF-17 components; production of sub-assemblies commenced on 22 January 2008. The PAF was to receive a further six pre-production aircraft in 2005, for a total of 8 out of an initial production run of 16 aircraft. <b>Initial</b> <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> was to be achieved by the end of 2008.

On December 29, 2015, Pakistan Aeronautical Complex (PAC) announced the rollout of 16th JF-17 Thunder fighter manufactured in the calendar year 2015, taking total number of manufactured aircraft to more than 66.

5|$|The {{squadron}} {{received its}} fifth KC-30 on 3December 2012, and achieved <b>initial</b> <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> in February 2013. It {{expected to reach}} final operating capability, with both boom and probe-and-drogue delivery systems, in 2014. On 14September that year, the Federal government committed to deploying one of the squadron's KC-30s to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates, {{as part of a}} coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. The aircraft was only cleared for operations with the probe-and-drogue system, as by this stage the boom system was not ready. The KC-30 began flying missions in Iraq on 1October 2014. The first successful contact using the boom system (in concert with another RAAF KC-30) took place near Amberley on 13May 2015. In July, the Federal government announced the purchase of two more KC-30s for delivery in 2018, taking No.33 Squadron's fleet to seven aircraft; the airframes were to be ex-Qantas A330-200 passenger liners, converted by Airbus Defence and Space at Getafe, near Madrid. The KC-30 deployed to Iraq undertook the first operational use of the boom system in late October 2015, refuelling an RAAF E-7 Wedgetail. In March 2016, No.33 Squadron was awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the RAAF's most proficient squadron of the previous year, as well as the RAAF Maintenance Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of the {{delivery}} of Australia's first C-17s, RAAF personnel received training on the aircraft in the United States. From May 2006 a group of pilots and loadmasters led by Wing Commander Linda Corbould, the commanding officer designate of No. 36 Squadron, undertook conversion training with the USAF's C-17 units at Altus Air Force Base and Charleston Air Force Base. A group of 48 technical personnel also received training at Charleston and McChord Air Force Base from September that year. No. 36 Squadron began a period of intensive training once Corbould delivered A41-206 to Amberley on 7 December 2006, and the unit achieved <b>initial</b> <b>operating</b> <b>capability</b> status in September 2007. Also in 2007, the RAAF's No. 1 Air Operations Support Squadron was expanded by 80 personnel to provide air load teams to support the Globemasters. A project to acquire the equipment needed to allow the RAAF's C-17s {{to be used in}} the aeromedical evacuation role and develop associated crew procedures began in late 2007. The first Globemaster aeromedical evacuation sortie was flown on 5 September 2008, the day after the type was certified to operate in this role. On 8 December 2008, Corbould led the RAAF's first all-female aircrew during a training flight over South East Queensland to mark the second anniversary of the entry of the Globemaster into service. A team of USAF trainers was posted to Amberley until the RAAF had sufficient C-17 pilots who were qualified to instruct others. The RAAF began training new C-17 pilots in early 2010 after the flight simulator was delivered, and the first Australian-trained pilots graduated in early May that year. No. 36 Squadron achieved final operating capability status in December 2011. The components for a simulated C-17 cargo compartment were delivered to Amberley in early 2013, and this facility was commissioned in November that year. The simulator is used to train air movements and medical staff as well as to develop and trial new cargo carrying techniques for the C-17s. The first Australian-trained Globemaster loadmasters graduated in mid-2014. The final element of C-17 aircrew training to be routinely conducted in the United States was the course to qualify co-pilots as aircraft captains. This course was relocated to Australia in mid-2017.|$|E
40|$|Problem Definition The Army’s Soldier as a System {{requirement}} identifies capability gaps {{with respect}} to dis-mounted battle command and situation awareness. As compared to their mounted peers, dismounted soldiers lack effective radio communications, situation awareness displays, and request or reporting systems that integrate with {{other elements of the}} combined arms team. In particular, networked voice and data communications, a user-defined situation awareness picture, networked lethality, and mission planning and rehearsal are not available to dismounted soldiers via their organic command and control systems. The Army’s Nett Warrior system will address some of the needs for dismounted command and control. This pro-gram is slated to reach <b>initial</b> <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> in 2012 with improvements and full <b>operating</b> <b>capabilities</b> in 2016.

It is necessary to take into account these changes at manufacturing stages of mechanical engineering products. Maximum efficiency can be obtained at the operational stage of the product life cycle only as a result of complex and interrelated measures during designing, manufacturing and usage of the specific product for its intended purpose with due account of its output parameter dynamics. While using the product an analysis of its output parameter dynamics will make it possible to determine maximum value of the <b>operating</b> <b>capability,</b> operational expenses and best practices for obtaining maximum profit per operating time unit.
