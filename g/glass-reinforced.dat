5|$|<b>Glass-reinforced</b> plastic (GRP) is a {{composite}} material or fiber-reinforced plastic made of a plastic reinforced by fine glass fibers. Like graphite-reinforced plastic, the composite material is {{commonly referred to as}} fiberglass. The glass can be {{in the form of a}} chopped strand mat (CSM) or a woven fabric.|$|E
5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's thermal sleeve, {{designed to}} regulate {{the temperature of the}} barrel, are made of <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic, while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. Originally the gun had an EFC barrel life of ~1,500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the average life has increased even further. The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a hydropneumatic assembly.|$|E
5|$|The trains {{were built}} in Goldau, Switzerland. CWA Constructions {{designed}} both the exterior and interior of the trains {{to make them look}} as faithful as possible to the Hogwarts Express seen in the Harry Potter film franchise. They are based on the steam locomotive GWR 4900 Class 5972 Olton Hall (as 5972 Hogwarts Castle) and were built from aluminum and <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastics. Afterwards, an artificial weathering process was applied to give the appearance of a historic train.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of glass fiber used in {{fiberglass}} is E-glass, which is alumino-borosilicate glass {{with less than}} 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastics. Other types of glass used are A-glass (Alkali-lime glass {{with little or no}} boron oxide), E-CR-glass (Electrical/Chemical Resistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (borosilicate glass, named for its low Dielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement), and S-glass (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).|$|E
25|$|High-voltage fuses of the {{expulsion}} type have fiber or <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic tubes {{and an open}} end, and can have the fuse element replaced.|$|E
25|$|Aluminosilicate glass: silica + alumina + lime + {{magnesia}} + {{barium oxide}} (BaO) + boric oxide (B2O3). Extensively used for fiberglass, used for making <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastics (boats, fishing rods, etc.) and for halogen bulb glass. Aluminosilicate glasses are also resistant to weathering and water erosion.|$|E
25|$|Temporary {{structures}} using <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic (GRP) segments {{bolted together}} and {{mounted on a}} frame are possible. As they may take some hours to construct, they {{are more suitable for}} applications such as exhibition stands, where a dome will stay up for a period of at least several days.|$|E
25|$|The Banshee is a built mostly out of {{composite}} material (Kevlar and <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic) with a tailess delta wing platform. The first models used a 26hp 342 cc Normalair-Garrett two-cylinder two-stroke driving a pusher propeller. Performance was 35-185 kt with an endurance from 1–3 hours. Flight control is by two elevons.|$|E
25|$|The Bedok {{class is}} made of <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic, {{designed}} by the Swedish Navy and Kockums (then known as Karlskronavarvet). Its low magnetic and acoustic signatures reduces the possibility of setting off mines. It is highly durable, fire- and shock-resistant, easy to repair and is maintained only by painting. The ship's bridge, major combat equipment and engines are also shock-mounted to cushion against underwater explosions.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Avions Pierre Robin started design of an ultra-lightweight two-seat light {{aircraft}} intended {{to meet the}} requirements of French flying clubs for a low-cost light trainer, as existing American training aircraft were becoming increasingly expensive, which was not helped by an unfavourable exchange rate, which resulted in a competition to supply a new light trainer, which could be mass-produced for supply to subsidised French flying clubs. Robin won the competition in 1983 with their ATL design, a single-engined low-winged monoplane with a fixed undercarriage and a V-tail. The ATL's fuselage was of <b>Glass-reinforced</b> plastic construction, with a wooden wing, while the V-tail is a conventional all-metal construction.|$|E
25|$|Fibre-reinforced plastic/polymer (FRP) and <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic (GRP) {{consist of}} fibres of polymer, glass, carbon, aramid or other {{polymers}} or high-strength fibres {{set in a}} resin matrix to form a rebar rod, or grid, or fibres. These rebars are installed {{in much the same}} manner as steel rebars. The cost is higher but, suitably applied, the structures have advantages, in particular a dramatic reduction in problems related to corrosion, either by intrinsic concrete alkalinity or by external corrosive fluids that might penetrate the concrete. These structures can be significantly lighter and usually have a longer service life. The cost of these materials has dropped dramatically since their widespread adoption in the aerospace industry and by the military.|$|E
25|$|As {{technology}} {{improved and}} operational knowledge grew, Oceaneering upgraded their fleet of JIMs. The magnesium construction {{was replaced with}} <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic (GRP) and the single joints with segmented ones, each allowing seven degrees of motion, and when added together giving the operator a very great range of motion. In addition, the four-port domed top of the suit {{was replaced by a}} transparent acrylic one that was taken from Wasp, this allowed the operator a much-improved field of vision. Trials were also carried out by the Ministry of Defence on a flying Jim suit powered from the surface through an umbilical cable. This resulted in a hybrid suit with the ability of working on the sea bed as well as mid water.|$|E
25|$|The Elite's most {{distinctive}} feature was its highly innovative fibreglass monocoque construction, {{in which a}} stressed-skin GRP unibody replaced the previously separate chassis and body components. Unlike the contemporary Chevrolet Corvette, which used fibreglass for only exterior bodywork, the Elite used <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic for the entire load-bearing structure of the car, although a steel subframe for supporting the engine and front suspension was bonded into {{the front of the}} monocoque, as was a square-section windscreen-hoop that provided mounting points for door hinges, jacking point for lifting the car and roll-over protection. The first 250 body units were made by Maximar Mouldings at Pulborough, Sussex. The body construction caused numerous early problems, until manufacture was handed over to Bristol Aeroplane Company.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} compete in {{international}} rallying, the car had to be homologated; for Group 4, the class the HS was {{to compete in}}, this meant building 400 production vehicles for public sale. Vauxhall created a far more powerful Chevette variant by fitting the 2.3litre slant-four engine, using a 16-valve cylinder head which Vauxhall was developing - though the rally cars used the Lotus 16-valve head until a rule change by the FIA banned them in 1978. Fitted with two Stromberg carburettors the engine developed 135 bhp. Suspension and rear axle were from the Opel Kadett C GT/E and the gearbox was a Getrag five-speed. Chevrolet Vega alloy wheels (similar in appearance to the Avon wheels used on the droopsnoot Firenza) were used, {{as well as a}} newly developed <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic air dam. The result was a very fast and well handling, if rather unrefined, road car. Like the Droopsnoot Firenza, the HS was available only in silver, with red highlighting and a bright red, black and tartan interior; though (partly to help sell unsold vehicles) some cars were repainted in other colours, such the black Mamos Garage HS-X.|$|E
25|$|One of the Bizon's {{more unusual}} {{features}} is the magazine, {{which is often}} mistaken for a grenade launcher. The cylinder below the barrel {{is in fact a}} 64-round helical-feed magazine, similar to the type used in the American Calico M960 submachine gun. The magazine is made from a durable <b>glass-reinforced</b> polyamide and mounts under the handguard in line with the barrel. This layout makes the weapon more compact and concealable. All cartridges are aligned nose forward in the Bizon magazine and cannot be loaded incorrectly. Early magazines were fabricated from aluminium tubing and had a capacity of 67 rounds. The production magazine capacity of 64 was selected as 64 is a multiple of 16, and 9×18mm Makarov rounds are packaged in boxes of 16. The magazine has hooks on top of the front end that engage a pair of pins under the front sight, and the rear end of the magazine interfaces with a Kalashnikov pattern spring-loaded paddle type magazine catch/release located in front of the trigger guard. Some magazines were produced with indicator holes allowing the user to verify the amount of ammunition loaded; these are spaced at 4, 24, 44 and 64-round increments.|$|E
500|$|The highly boronated glasses used in {{fiberglass}} are E-glass (named for [...] "Electrical" [...] use, but now {{the most}} common fiberglass for general use). E-glass is alumino-borosilicate glass with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastics. Other common high-boron glasses include C-glass, an alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation, and D-glass, a borosilicate glass, named for its low Dielectric constant).|$|E
500|$|The Cathedral {{was built}} quickly and economically, and {{this led to}} {{problems}} with {{the fabric of the}} building, including leaks. [...] A programme of repairs was carried out during the 1990s. The building had been faced with mosaic tiles, but these were impossible to repair and were replaced with <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic, which gave it a thicker appearance. [...] The aluminium in the lantern was replaced by stainless steel, and the slate paving of the platform was replaced with concrete flags.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, {{the artist}} {{presented}} a revised concept to TriMet's Public Art Advisory Committee. The sculpture's color and dimensions were unchanged, {{but it would}} be made of <b>glass-reinforced</b> concrete. Its surface treatment remained undetermined, but Alavi wanted one that would be [...] "natural or inherent" [...] to the material to achieve a [...] "reflective, glowing, and magical" [...] appearance. The committee preferred the reflective appearance seen in the artist's original design and requested material samples at his final presentation, which was scheduled to take place in December.|$|E
500|$|Glass fiber has roughly {{comparable}} {{mechanical properties}} to other fibers such as polymers and carbon fiber. Although {{not as strong}} or as rigid as carbon fiber, it is much cheaper and significantly less brittle when used in composites. Glass fibers are therefore used as a reinforcing agent for many polymer products; to form a very strong and relatively lightweight fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) composite material called <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic (GRP), also popularly known as [...] "fiberglass". This material contains little or no air or gas, is more dense, and is a much poorer thermal insulator than is glass wool.|$|E
500|$|The {{bodywork}} of the BT19 is <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic, {{finished in}} Brabham's usual racing colours of green with gold trimming around the nose. Although {{the science of}} aerodynamics would not greatly affect Formula One racing until the 1968 season, Tauranac had been making use of the Motor Industry Research Association wind tunnel since 1963 to refine {{the shape of his}} cars. Brabham has attributed the car's [...] "swept-down nose and the upswept rear lip of the engine cowl" [...] to Tauranac's [...] "attention to aerodynamic detail". During the 1967 season, the car appeared with small winglets on the nose, to further reduce lift acting {{at the front of the}} car.|$|E
500|$|Amex House [...] "dominates {{the sweep}} of Carlton Hill" [...] and is visible on the skyline from much of Brighton. Designed by British {{architecture}} firm Gollins Melvin and Ward, the building has prominent white horizontal bands of <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic and blue-tinted glazing, and its corners are chamfered {{to give it a}} more rounded appearance. It is nicknamed [...] "The Wedding Cake", and its clean, futuristic design has been said to evoke Thunderbirds. The building is generally considered {{to be one of the}} better postwar additions to Brighton's building stock, although it affects views into and out of the neighbouring conservation area. About 3,000 people work at the building, making American Express the largest private employer in Brighton and Hove.|$|E
500|$|The building's {{decorative}} exterior contributes its building's robotic appearance, {{though it}} often serves practical functions as well. Two antennas on the building's roof {{are used for}} communications and as lightning rods. [...] On the building's upper facade, {{in front of the}} main meeting and dining rooms of the top executive suites, are two 6m (19.7ft) lidded eyeballs that serve as windows. [...] The eyeballs are made of reflective glass; the lids are made of metallic louvers. Nuts made of <b>glass-reinforced</b> concrete adorn the building's sides; the building's largest nuts measure 3.8m (12.5ft) in diameter and were the largest in the world {{at the time of their}} construction. The building's east and west walls (the robot's sides) have few apertures to shield its interior from the sun and to increase energy efficiency, and its north and south sides (the robot's front and back) are tinted curtain walls whose bright blue color was chosen because it was the symbol of the Bank of Asia.|$|E
500|$|The M2B was a {{mid-engined}} {{rear-wheel drive}} monocoque design, monocoques having been popularised by Lotus's 25 of 1962. Influenced by his aerospace experience, Herd built the chassis with Mallite, a material that {{had originally been}} designed for internal panelling in aircraft. Mallite is a composite of balsa wood bonded between two sheets of aluminium alloy that is much stiffer than ordinary aluminium alloy, a useful characteristic for a racing car. However, the material proved {{to be difficult to}} bend into the curved shapes needed and so, whilst the M2A prototype was made entirely of Mallite except for the steel bulkheads, on the M2B it was utilised only for the inner and upper skins, the remainder being aluminium alloy. Mallite was also complicated to repair after crash damage. Its use did mean though that the chassis was the stiffest then built for an open-cockpit car, with torsional rigidity of nearly [...] per degree. <b>Glass-reinforced</b> plastic bodywork covered the nose, cockpit and engine. Fuel was stored in rubber bag tanks situated within the moncoque.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{the need}} for plans for {{long-term}} energy strategies, Botswana's Ministry of Science and Technology designed and built a small-scale research tower. This experiment ran from 7 October to 22 November 2005. It had an inside diameter of [...] and a height of , manufactured from <b>glass-reinforced</b> polyester, with an area of approximately [...] The roof was made of a 5mm thick clear glass supported by a steel framework.|$|E
2500|$|The outer {{bodywork}} {{was mostly}} {{formed by the}} monocoque, except for the nose and cockpit which were covered by <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic (GRP) panels; the engine sometimes also had a GRP cover. The wheelbase was the front track [...] and the rear track weight was [...] McLaren's own magnesium alloy wheels were used; they were [...] diameter at the rear and 15- or sometimes [...] diameter at the front.|$|E
2500|$|Concrete {{and steel}} framing became {{common in the}} 20th century: {{examples}} include the new Hove Town Hall, Brighton's police station and courthouse, and the original Churchill Square shopping centre. [...] Amex House, a corporate headquarters in the Carlton Hill area, was the first building in Britain to use <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic. The New England Quarter, an early 21st-century mixed-use development, has many buildings clad in an elastomic render with timber cladding and large areas of glass.|$|E
2500|$|The SMF knife is {{manufactured}} by Strider Knives of Escondido, California. [...] The knife features a [...] drop point flat ground tiger striped blade of CPM S30V steel. [...] The handle {{is composed of}} a fire anodized titanium frame, oil impregnated bronze bushings, an oversized pivot screw [...] in diameter, and a textured G10 <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic scale with an incorporated backspacer. [...] The NATO Stock Number (NSN) for the SMF knife is 1095-01-531-5015.|$|E
2500|$|The VariViggen design {{led to the}} {{successful}} Rutan VariEze (pronounced [...] "very easy") homebuilt experimental aircraft designs, in which he pioneered the use of moldless <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic construction in homebuilts. The prototype made its public debut at the 1975 EAA Convention and Fly-In (now called AirVenture) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. That same year, his brother Dick Rutan set a world distance record in the under-500kg (1100lb) class in the VariEze, and these aircraft went on to set other world records in this class.|$|E
2500|$|The work {{is made of}} <b>glass-reinforced</b> {{plastic and}} the joints of steel. [...] It covers {{approximately}} , measuring [...] high and [...] wide. [...] Three-quarters of the weight comes from the frame, making up a combined total of 8 tonnes. [...] It resembles the parts of a model kit, containing pieces in {{the shapes of the}} 27 member states of the EU. Each piece has a distinctive theme that portrays stereotypes about the country, some of which are portrayed in a particularly provocative manner. Among the pieces which have attracted the most attention are those of Bulgaria, Denmark, Germany, Poland and Slovakia.|$|E
2500|$|The AD500 was [...] "a new-generation airship {{making use}} of {{advanced}} materials and technology." [...] It was [...] long and contained [...] of helium. Materials used in the ship included thin single-ply polyester, coated with titanium dioxide-doped polyurethane, for the envelope; Kevlar for the cables suspending the gondola {{from the top of}} the envelope; a Kevlar nosecone moulded in the same manner as <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic; and a gondola moulded by Vickers–Slingsby from Kevlar-reinforced plastic. Other innovations featured in the AD500 included simplified controls and thrust vectoring— an old airship idea revived— via inboard-mounted Porsche engines driving vectoring ducted fans.|$|E
2500|$|The Slingsby Dart was {{the last}} of a long line of gliders and {{sailplanes}} built by Slingsby Sailplanes Ltd almost entirely from wood. [...] From the Slingsby Skylark 2 of 1953 onwards, the company had used Gaboon ply, thicker but less dense than the traditional birch for surfacing wings and fuselage, as it gave a smoother surface capable of maintaining the more demanding profiles of the newer aerofoils. The Capstan flew ten years later with double curvature parts of the fuselage skin produced from <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic (G.R.P). Combined, these were the construction methods initially used for the Dart.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to upgrades to the JIM design, other {{variations of the}} original suit were constructed. The first, named the SAM Suit (Designated A.D.S III), was a completely aluminium model. A smaller and lighter suit, it was more anthropomorphic than the original JIMs and was depth-rated to [...] Attempts were made to limit corrosion {{by the use of}} a chromic anodizing coating applied to the arm and leg joints, which gave them an unusual green color. The SAM suit stood at [...] in height, and had a life-support duration of 20 hours. Only three SAM suits would be produced by UMEL before the design was shelved. The second, named the JAM suit (Designated A.D.S IV), was constructed of <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic (GRP) and was depth-rated for around [...]|$|E
2500|$|The Clubman/Turbostar/Electrostar {{platform}} is a modular design, optimised for speedy manufacture and easy maintenance. It {{consists of an}} underframe, which is created by seam-welding a number of aluminium alloy extrusions, upon which bodyside panels are mounted followed by a single piece roof, again made from extruded sections. The car ends (cabs) are made from <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic and steel, and are huck-bolted onto the main car bodies. Underframe components are collected in 'rafts', which are bolted into slots on the underframe extrusion. The mostly aluminium alloy body gives light weight to help acceleration and energy efficiency. Electrostar units have a shorter [...] version of the Turbostar's [...] body as Electrostars have 3 or 4 cars per unit rather than 2 or 3 for Turbostars.|$|E
2500|$|For minehunting operations, the Huons use three [...] Riva Calzoni azimuth {{thrusters}} {{to provide}} a maximum speed of : two are located at the stern, while the third is sited behind the variable-depth sonar. Mines are located with the minehunting sonar, and can be disposed of by the vessel's two Double Eagle mine disposal vehicles, the Oropesa mechanical sweep, the Mini-Dyad magnetic influence sweep, or the towed AMASS influence sweep (which is not always carried). To prevent damage in the event a Huon-class ship triggers a mine, the ships were built with a <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic, moulded in a single monocoque skin with no ribs or framework. As the ships often work with clearance divers, they are fitted with a small recompression chamber.|$|E
2500|$|Nine {{companies}} {{expressed interest}} in the project; of these, seven had the required capability to build the ships. These seven were narrowed down to three based on each tender's merit, competitiveness with the other tenders, and successful meeting of Australian industry involvement targets for both construction and long-term support. Austal Ships and Defence Maritime Services (DMS) partnered to offer twelve ships based on an expanded version of the latter's , in use with the Australian Customs Service. The companies submitted two proposals for a [...] vessel, one with a steel hull, and one with an aluminium hull; the latter offering a 21% reduction in fuel consumption. Australian Defence Industries (ADI) tendered a design based on the Royal Danish Navy's [...] The vessel was to be built with a <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic hull, similar to ADI's s. The Tenix proposal was a variant of a [...] search and rescue vessel constructed for the Philippine Coast Guard. The tender was awarded to the Austal/DMS partnership in December 2003. The contract was valued at A$553million, with each ship costing between A$24million and A$28million to construct.|$|E
2500|$|Resembling a [...] "stretched" [...] Market-Frankford Line M-4 car or the M8 cars {{used by the}} Metro-North Railroad, the Silverliner V {{cars have}} three doors on each side: one each a quarter length from {{each end of the}} cars for {{boarding}} and alighting at stations with either high or low-level platforms, and an additional door adjacent to one of the quarter-point doors used at high-level platforms for faster arrivals and departures at the major Center City zone stations (University City, 30th Street, Suburban/Penn Center, Jefferson, and Temple University). They also feature wider aisles and seats, and dedicated areas for wheelchairs and power scooters. In place of the <b>glass-reinforced</b> plastic placards denoting the train route, the train route and destination are displayed on new colored LED panels on both the front and sides of the train, and improved PA systems allows the automated system to announce station names. The new trains feature enhanced security, with CCTV cameras that are able to broadcast over a proprietary wireless network to the Command Center at SEPTA's headquarters. There are three basic Silverliner V car types: 38 single cars, numbered 701-738, and the 82 single-cab [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B" [...] cars which make up the 41 two-car married pairs, numbered 801-882.|$|E
