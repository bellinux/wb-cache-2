50|$|When King Philip II {{employed}} the Italian engineer Juan Bautista Antonelli {{to design a}} master plan of fortifications for Cartagena, construction would actually continue {{for the next two}} hundred years. On 17 March 1640, three Portuguese ships under the command of Rodrigo Lobo da Silva, ran aground in the Bocagrande Channel. This accelerated the formation of a sand bar, which soon connected the Bocagrande Peninsula to the island of Tierrabomba. The defense of the bay then shifted to two forts on either side of Bocachica, San Jose and San Luis de Bocachica. San Luis was replaced by San Fernando after the 1741 English raid. The next narrow passage was formed by the Island of Manzanillo, where San Juan del Manzanillo was constructed and Santa Cruz O Castillo Grande opposite on Cruz Grande at Punta Judio, both connected by a <b>floating</b> <b>chain.</b> Finally, there was San Felipe del Boqueron, later San Sebastian del Pastelillo. The city itself was circled with a ring of bastions connected by curtains. The island of Getsemani was also fortified. Protecting the city on the landward side, atop San Lazaro hill, was the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas named in honor of Spains King Philip IV and Governor Pedro Zapata de Mendoza, Marquis of Barajas father, the Count of Barajas. Completed in 1654, the fort was expanded in the 18th Century, and included underground corridors and galleries.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} article, {{which is}} part of a broader project on tourism {{promotion}} still underway, is to investigate the role of language in tourist promotion and the ways brochures convey meaning. In particular the focus will be on the descriptive sections of tourist brochures. Fundamental to such an investigation is the belief that, despite the contemporary emphasis on the visual aspects of promotion, the written text performs a key function in the decision-making process which draws people to a tourist destination. Barthes stated that the function of the linguistic message was to “anchor” the spectrum of possible meanings, by selecting some interpretations and securing the intended meaning. The linguistic level “fixes the <b>floating</b> <b>chain</b> of signifieds {{in such a way as}} to counter the terror of uncertain signs” (Barthes 1964 : 37). Very rarely does the language speak through pictures alone. As Dann puts it “where photographs are featured, almost without exception they appear in tandem with a verbal message” (Dann 1996 : 188). Even though in most tourist brochures the emphasis is mainly iconographic, the verbal text plays an important part in the promotion of a tourist product...|$|E

50|$|Siphons are {{sometimes}} employed as automatic machines, {{in situations where}} it is desirable to turn a continuous trickling flow or an irregular small surge flow into a large surge volume. A common {{example of this is}} a public restroom with urinals regularly flushed by an automatic siphon in a small water tank overhead. When the container is filled, all the stored liquid is released, emerging as a large surge volume that then resets and fills again. One way to do this intermittent action involves complex machinery such as <b>floats,</b> <b>chains,</b> levers, and valves, but these can corrode, wear out, or jam over time. An alternate method is with rigid pipes and chambers, using only the water itself in a siphon as the operating mechanism.|$|R

40|$|In {{the melt}} polymer conformations are nearly ideal {{according}} to Flory's ideality hypothesis. Silberberg generalized this statement for chains in the interfacial region. We check the Silberberg argument {{by analyzing the}} conformations of a probe chain end-grafted at a solid surface {{in a sea of}} <b>floating</b> free <b>chains</b> of concentration f by the self-consistent field (SCF) method. Apart from the grafting, probe <b>chain</b> and <b>floating</b> <b>chains</b> are identical. Most of the results were obtained for a standard SCF model with freely jointed chains on a six-choice lattice, where immediate step reversals are allowed. A few data were generated for a five-choice lattice, where such step reversals are forbidden. These coarse-grained models describe the equilibrium properties of flexible atactic polymer chains at the scale of the segment length. The concentration was varied over the whole range from f = 0 (single grafted chain) to f = 1 (probe chain in the melt). The number of contacts with the surface, average height of the free end and its dispersion, average loop and train length, tail size distribution, end-point and overall segment distributions were calculated for a grafted probe chain as a function of f, for several chain lengths and substrate/polymer interactions, which were varied from strong repulsion to strong adsorption. The computations show that the conformations of the probe chain in the melt do not depend on substrate/polymer interactions and are very similar to the conformations of a single end-grafted chain under critical conditions, and can thus be described analytically. When the substrate/polymer interaction is fixed at the value corresponding to critical conditions, all equilibrium properties of a probe chain are independent of f, over the whole range from a dilute solution to the melt. We believe that the conformations of all flexible chains in the surface region of the melt are close to those of an appropriate single chain in critical conditions, provided that one end of the single chain is fixed at the same point as a chain in the melt...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{interaction}} {{problem of a}} linear polymer <b>chain,</b> <b>floating</b> in fractal containers that belong to the three-dimensional Sierpinski gasket (3 D SG) family of fractals, with a surface-adsorbed linear polymer chain. Each member of the 3 D SG fractal family has a fractal impenetrable 2 D adsorbing surface, {{which appears to be}} 2 D SG fractal. The two-polymer system is modelled by two mutually crossing self-avoiding walks. By applying the Monte Carlo Renormalization Group (MCRG) method, we calculate the critical exponents ϕ, associated with the number of contacts of the 3 D SG <b>floating</b> polymer <b>chain,</b> and the 2 D SG adsorbed polymer chain, for a sequence of SG fractals with 2 < b< 40. Besides, we propose the codimension additivity (CA) argument formula for ϕ, and compare its predictions with our reliable set of the MCRG data. We find that ϕ monotonically decreases with increasing b, that is, with increase of the container fractal dimension. Finally, we discuss the relations between different contact exponents, and analyze their possible behaviour in the fractal-to-Euclidean crossover region b→∞. Comment: 15 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

50|$|Resistive chain level sensors {{are similar}} to {{magnetic}} float level sensors in that a permanent magnet sealed inside a float moves {{up and down a}} stem in which closely spaced switches and resistors are sealed. When the switches are closed, the resistance is summed and converted to current or voltage signals that are proportional {{to the level of the}} liquid. The choice of float and stem materials depends on the liquid in terms of chemical compatibility as well as specific gravity and other factors that affect buoyancy. These sensors work well for liquid level measurements in marine, chemical processing, pharmaceuticals, food processing, waste treatment, and other applications. With the proper choice of two <b>floats,</b> resistive <b>chain</b> level sensors can also be used to monitor for the presence of an interface between two immiscible liquids whose specific gravities are more than 0.6, but differ by as little as 0.1 unit.|$|R

We consider the guaranteed physics of horizontal (hadron) air-showers, HAS, developing at high (30 − 40) km altitudes, above and below these energy windows. Their morphology and information traces are different from vertical ones. Hundreds of km long HAS are often split by geomagnetic fields in a long (fan-like) showering with a twin spiral tail. The horizontal fan-like airshowers are really tangent and horizontal only at North and South poles. At different latitude their showering plane are turned and inclined by geomagnetic fields.

Subsequently, using suitable assumptions, the method of position adjustment to approach equilibrium condition is introduced. This method is based on the concept of statically determinate equilibrium in each step. The feasibility of the method proposed in this paper is verified by comparing the calculated results with model test measurements and published reference predictions.

5000|$|The canal was {{designed}} for tub-boats which were 26 by 6.5 ft. The inclines at Thornfalcon, Wrantage and Ilminster were double-acting inclines, consisting of two parallel tracks, each containing a six-wheeled caisson, in which the boats <b>floated.</b> A <b>chain</b> linked the two caissons together, passing round a horizontal drum situated {{at the top of}} the incline. Power for the movement of the boats was provided by over-filling the top caisson, the extra weight causing that caisson to descend and the other to rise. Because the majority of traffic passed up the canal, and a boat displaces its own weight in water (Archimedes' principle), considerably more water passed down the incline than up it. However, the system was still more economical than using locks, and a large new Chard Reservoir supplied the necessary water. The incline at Chard Common was quite different, consisting of a single track, with the tub-boats being carried on a cradle with four wheels. Power was supplied by a Whitelaw and Stirrat water turbine, with a 25 ft head, which used [...] of water per minute. Boats were raised 86 ft in a wheeled cradle up a slope of 1:10. The cradle was attached to the turbine by a substantial wire rope, after breakages of the original rope.

40|$|The use of {{floating}} point number representation {{is very common}} in digital audio workstations and in signal processing. However there are no analogue to digital converters or digital to analogue converters for professional audio work that use floating point directly therefore fixed point values must be converted to floating point. The research literature on how this affects the sound quality is very scarce and thus a systematic investigation is motivated. In this thesis <b>floating</b> point signal <b>chains</b> are simulated, with various amounts of processing applied. Both 24 bit and 16 bit fixed point inputs and outputs are used. When the conversion is nontransparent, the 32 bit and 64 bit intermediate formats produce similar amounts of deviation for 16 bit input and output. When the input and output is 24 bit fixed point the 32 bit intermediate format produces fewer deviations however the magnitude is greater. When the conversion is transparent no deviations were found when using 64 bit intermediate format, regardless of input and output format. The 32 bit intermediate signal chain however produces deviations that increase in number by the square root of the number calculations performed when input and output is 24 bit.

A [...] Nowadays Hidrovía S. A. is maintaining the aid to navigation of the main river in Argentina, a concession given by the national government of maintaining and dredging more than 1500 km of waterway. The aid to navigation can be divided in roughly three types: buoy, beacon and spar, which they mainly hold up by using corrective maintenance. This could positively be changed by adapting some maintenance strategies. Using a Fault Tree Analysis and Failure Mode Effect Analysis during the RCM process, a few things were noticed; the three types of Aid to Navigation (AtoN) have a lot different sub components in common, the buoy has the highest failure rate and within the buoy there are six critical sub components: the top mark, lantern, battery (case), solar panel, <b>floating</b> system and <b>chain.</b> These six critical sub components could gain more reliability by adapting the maintenance policy: scheduled maintenance of the lantern, battery case and solar panel, redesign of the floating system and a combined strategy (preventive and scheduled maintenance) for the chain. In order to give a real maintenance policy adaptation, unfortunately more information is needed. More research should be done in the possibility of combining the scheduled replacement with the preventive maintenance and the redesigned buoys replacement. Also, the feasibility of the redesignitself should be looked into. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesHydraulic EngineeringConstruction Management and Engineerin...|$|R
