40|$|Introduction: A single {{gallbladder}} with a <b>double</b> cystic <b>duct</b> is a {{very rare}} finding. In addition, few cases with this rare condition are preoperatively diagnosed. However, the preoperative confirmation or suspicion of this rare condition could facilitate safe laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is a minimally invasive therapeutic modality for gallbladder disease. We herein present a case of gallstone disease in a patient with a <b>double</b> cystic <b>duct</b> who was preoperatively diagnosed and successfully treated with laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Presentation of case: A 57 -year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with epigastric pain. Gallstone disease in the gallbladder and common bile duct was diagnosed by ultrasonography and computed tomography. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERC) {{revealed that the aberrant}} cystic duct arose from the cystic duct and communicated with the intrahepatic bile duct of the posterior segmental branch. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully performed in combination with intraoperative cholangiography. Discussion: If an anomaly of the biliary duct system is not identified during surgery, it {{may turn out to be}} a bile leak. The preoperative diagnosis of a <b>double</b> cystic <b>duct</b> allows laparoscopic cholecystectomy to be performed safely in combination with intraoperative cholangiography.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with long-range sound propagation in deep water.   The main area of interest is the stability of acoustic ray paths in wave guides {{in which there is}} a transition from single to <b>double</b> <b>duct</b> sound speed profiles, or vice-versa.   Sound propagation is modelled within a ray theoretical framework, which facilitates a dynamical systems approach of understanding long-range propagation phenomena, and the use of its tools of analysis. Alternative reduction techniques to the Poincaré sections are presented, by which the stability of acoustic rays can be graphically determined.   Beyond periodic driving, these techniques prove to be useful in case of the simplest quasiperiodic driving of the ray equations.   One of the techniques facilitates a special representation of ray trajectories for periodic driving. Namely, the space of sectioned trajectories is partitioned into nonintersecting regular and chaotic regions as with the Poincaré sections, when quasiperiodic and chaotic trajectories are represented by curve segments and area filling points, respectively.   In case of the simplest quasiperiodic driving – speaking about the same technique – regular trajectories are represented by curves similar to Lissajous curves, which are opened or closed depending on whether the two driving frequencies involved make relative primes or not. It is confirmed for a perturbed canonical profile that the background sound speed structure controls ray stability. It is also demonstrated for a particular <b>double</b> <b>duct</b> profile, when the singularity of the nonlinearity parameter for the homoclinic trajectory associated with this profile refers to the strong instability of corresponding perturbed trajectories.

MethodsFrom 2004 to 2010, 200 consecutive living donor right lobe liver transplantations were performed. The database was evaluated retrospectively. Biliary complications were diagnosed according to clinical, biochemical and radiological tests. The number of biliary ducts in the transplanted graft, the surgical techniques used for anastomosis, biliary strictures and bile leakage rates were analysed. ResultsOf a total of 200 grafts, 117 invloved a single bile duct, 77 had two bile ducts and in six grafts there were three bile ducts. In 166 transplants, the anastomosis was performed as a single duct to duct, in 21 transplants <b>double</b> <b>duct</b> to ducts, in one transplant, three duct to ducts and in 12 transplants as a Roux-en-Y reconstruction. In all, 40 bile leakages (20 %) and 17 biliary strictures (8. 5 %) were observed in 49 patients {{resulting in a total}} of 57 biliary complications (28. 5 %).

Consequently, {{a proportion of}} patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy for suspected malignancy will ultimately have benign disease. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare preoperative clinical and diagnostic characteristics of patients with unexpected benign disease after pancreatoduodenectomy with those of patients with confirmed (pre) malignant disease. We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study in 1, 629 consecutive patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy for suspected malignancy between 2003 and 2010 in 11 Dutch centers. Preoperative characteristics were compared in a benign:malignant ratio of 1 : 3. Malignant cases were selected from the entire cohort by using a random number list. A multivariable logistic regression prediction model was constructed to predict benign disease. Of 107 patients (6. 6 %) with unexpected benign disease after pancreatoduodenectomy, 86 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with 258 patients with (pre) malignant disease. Patients with benign disease presented more often with pain (56 vs. 38 %; P = 0. 004), but less frequently with jaundice (60 vs. 80 %; P < 0. 01), a pancreatic mass (13 vs. 54 %, P < 0. 001), or a <b>double</b> <b>duct</b> sign on computed tomography (21 vs. 47 %; P < 0. 001).

Case Presentation A 74 -year-old woman was referred by her gastroenterologist with painless jaundice. She presented with several months of decreased appetite and a three week history of light colored stool with dark urine.

No vascular invasion, celiac or periceliac lymph nodes were noted. Two biliary stents were placed and no biopsies were taken during the procedure. Prior to considering the patient a candidate for surgery, a high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan was performed with pancreatic protocol in non-contrast, arterial and venous phase to determine resectablity. CT scan was consistent with a <b>double</b> <b>duct</b> sign with markedly dilated pancreatic and common bile duct and intrahepatic biliary dilation secondary to mass on the pancreatic head.

Materials and Methods The diagnostic value of CEUS using SonoVue® in addition to US in the diagnosis of pancreatic lesions, especially pancreatic adenocarcinoma, was investigated. Furthermore, CEUS was compared to other imaging modalities such as the CT, EUS and the MRI. 124 patients with histologically confirmed pancreatic lesions were investigated by US and CEUS. 79 patients also received CT, 33 EUS and 7 MRI. Results The mean size of pancreatic adenocarcinomas was 46 mm and of NET 40, 1 mm. By use of B-mode-US pancreatic adenocarcinoma were hypoechoic in 97, 6 % and NET in 94, 4 % of cases. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma was homogenous in 90, 5 %, NET in 77, 8 %. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas were polycyclic in 97, 6 %, NET in 94, 4 %. In 64, 3 % of all pancreatic adenocarcinomas the pancreatic duct was dilatated. In pancreatic carcinomas of the head, the pancreatic duct was dilated in 84, 3 %, a <b>double</b> <b>duct</b> sign was present in 54, 9 % of cases. By use of CEUS, pancreatic adenocarcinomas appeared to be hypovascular in 92, 9 % of cases. In contrast, NET were hypervascular in 77, 8 %. Sensitivity of CEUS for diagnosis of a pancreatic lesion in all patients was 99, 2 %, for CT 88, 6 %, for EUS 90, 9 % and for MRI 85, 7 %. Sensitivity of CEUS {{for the detection of}} ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 98, 8 %, CT 90, 4 % and EUS 94, 7 %. Concerning the final histological diagnosis "pancreatic carcinoma", accuracy of CEUS was 91, 6 %, CT 32, 7 % and EUS 42, 1 %. After CEUS-based diagnosis and staging CT was performed in 61, 9 % of all cases with pancreatic carcinoma. Sensitivity of CEUS for the description of NET was 100 %, for CT 90 % and for EUS 100 %. Concerning the later confirmed histological diagnosis "NET" sensivity of CEUS was 83, 3 %, of CT 40 % and of EUS 33, 3 %. Conclusions The current survey shows that ultrasonography is a suitable imaging modality for the detection of malignant panreatic masses but conventional B-mode-US isn't able to differenciate between ductal pancreatic carcinoma and NET. CEUS however allows good visualisation of malignant pancreatic tumors and, in contrast to other imaging modalities as CT and EUS, is able to differentiate between pancreatic carcinoma and NET in the majority of cases...|$|R
