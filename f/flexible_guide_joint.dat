40|$|Abstract:- By {{analyzing}} {{the structure and}} motion characteristics of the <b>flexible</b> <b>guide</b> system of the projectile-feeding chain of a small-bore naval gun, a mathematical model of three-dimensional space attitude dynamic simulation for the <b>flexible</b> <b>guide</b> is proposed; also the corresponding dynamic simulation software is developed. Through which the position of each guide piece in the <b>flexible</b> <b>guide</b> can be determined when the naval gun’s rotating and pitching angle of fire is of any degree. Then the friction force between the projectile-chain and the <b>flexible</b> <b>guide</b> can be calculated according to each guide piece’s position and projectile-chain’s moving velocity and the friction factor. Consequently the automation’s load can be determined. The result of computing can be the criteria to the automation’s designing parameters. Moreover, it is significant to study the adaptive technology of the raise-feed system of the small-bore naval gun...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The dynamic {{characteristics}} of linear rolling <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> have great {{influence on the}} {{dynamic characteristics}} of machine tools. In this paper, the relative deformation of guide interface was analyzed based on Hertz theory and normal contact stiffness of <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> was calculated first. Then, the vibration model of linear rolling <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> was performed. The kinetic energy and potential energy of carriage-rail system was derived. Based on Lagrange’s approach, motion equilibrium equations of different vibration modes were derived. At last, vibration test was designed to get natural frequencies and mode shapes of the carriage. The natural frequencies agreed well with the values calculated by analytical approach. The research results provided a theoretical foundation for obtaining vibration characteristics parameters of linear rolling <b>guide</b> <b>joint</b> and a reliable way for analysis of the dynamic characteristics of similar machine joints...|$|R

The aim of {{the study}} is to provide a {{framework}} for effective private sector participation in infrastructure development and finance, not to provide a rigid structure to guide the participation. Thus the framework is a <b>flexible</b> <b>guide</b> to guide the relationship with local governments. The study will be limited to the following aspects: - projects commissioned and managed by the local sphere of government in South Africa; - projects financed by funding outside of the national treasury budget allocations; and - infrastructure projects that may include physical infrastructure (roads), social infrastructure (clinic) and economic infrastructure (electrical substation). Even though the scope of the study may be limited, the study can provide critical insight in terms of private sector participation possibilities in infrastructure development in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Previous joint {{models of}} Chinese part-of-speech (POS) tagging and {{dependency}} parsing are extended from either graph- or transition-based dependency models. Our analysis {{shows that the}} two models have different error distributions.

These motivate us to study the problem of stacking graph- and transition-based joint models. We conduct experiments on Chinese Penn Treebank 5. 1 (CTB 5. 1). The results demonstrate that the <b>guided</b> transition-based <b>joint</b> model obtains better performance than the <b>guided</b> graph-based <b>joint</b> model. Further, we introduce a constituent-based joint model which derives the POS tag sequence and dependency tree from the output of PCFG parsers, and then integrate it into the <b>guided</b> transition-based <b>joint</b> model.

With this technique, the needle should be kept parallel to the transducer to be visible, which makes targeting the recess rather than the joint line easier. A potential drawback of ultrasound-guided arthrography is the limited view of the whole joint and potential communications with neighbouring structures during injection.|$|R

The argument shows earlier analyses of joint action to be fundamentally flawed because they have not taken contextual influences on joint action properly into account.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} role of the `hydrogen economy' as a guiding vision {{encompassing}} multiple contested technological futures, value judgements and problem framings. Hydrogen visions draw upon six overarching and competing narrative themes: power and independence; community empowerment and democratisation; ecotopia; hydrogen as technical fix; inevitability and technical progress; and `staying in the race'. In other words the hydrogen economy possesses great interpretive flexibility. This, it is argued, is the key to hydrogen's rhetorical power, allowing it to become a space in which divergent interests and agendas are promoted. Turning to issues of scale and place, the case of London is used to document the dynamics of expectations: how the open <b>flexible</b> <b>guiding</b> vision of a hydrogen economy must inevitably be re-invented and grounded in local agendas and contexts if its promise is to become realised...|$|R
50|$|Sinus surgery with {{balloons}} may {{be performed}} in a hospital, outpatient surgery setting or in the physician’s office under local anesthesia. The physician inserts a guide catheter through the nostril and near the sinus opening under endoscopic visualization. A <b>flexible</b> <b>guide</b> wire is then introduced into the targeted sinus to confirm access. Most guide wires have a light on the tip which may produce light transmission seen through the skin to help the physician with correct placement of the guide wire. Once access to a blocked sinus is confirmed, a balloon catheter is advanced over the guide wire and positioned in the blocked sinus opening for inflation. The balloon is inflated. If the procedure is successful, the sinus will remain open after the balloon is deflated and removed as the bone surrounding the sinus is permanently remodeled.|$|R

40|$|Municipal Planning in a {{mixed economy}} is {{subjected}} to two sets of restrictions: those caused by {{the character of the}} politicoeconomic system and those arising from the relationship between the central and the municipal government. Planning methods need to take these restrictions into explicit consideration {{if they are to be}} useful. This paper discusses the first set of restrictions in connection with the analysis of economic planning in France and Sweden. The 'degree of plannedness' (manner and extent of planning) is related to the extent of governmental control with regard to the plan itself, its construction, and its implementation. The second set of restrictions is either of legal and 'regulatory' nature or defined by the economic relationship between the central and the local government. Thus municipal plans in a mixed economy become a <b>flexible</b> <b>guide</b> to municipal policymaking rather than a control instrument over municipal development. ...|$|R

The needs of singles are often ignored or misunderstood, and this paper argues that coaching offers an effective framework for helping them form and secure sustainable life-partnerships.

Rather than emphasising a therapeutic role or aiming for profound inner change, relationship coaching seeks to foster more adaptive relationship attitudes and skills.
