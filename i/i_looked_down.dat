500|$|Los Angeles had {{acquired}} Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Washington's {{style of play}} complemented him, as Abdul-Jabbar was not an especially physical player. Washington played well, averaging 9.7 points and 9.3 rebounds; however, he struggled with tendinitis in his knee the entire season. His wife pleaded with him to sit out some games, but he took painkillers and kept playing. Washington finally tore the patella tendon in a late season game against Denver. [...] "I could feel it tearing inside. <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down,</b> and my kneecap was hanging {{on the side of}} my leg." [...] Doctors covered his entire leg in a cast and told him his basketball career was most likely over.|$|E

Tull took the best moments from the 88different concerts of the tour, to create a cohesive documentary. He recalled that there were numerous footage available from the tour and they had to find the [...] "perfect" [...] shot for Madonna. He gave an example that the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] had cuts from 50 countries alone. [...] "It was really intense. I think <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> one day and I was like, 'Oh, my fingers are about to fall off'. But it was worth it", Tull concluded. A preview for the DVD was first shown at the Billboard Music Awards and another preview was released in June 2013, showing the singer performing [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'" [...] on the tour, the lead single from MDNA. Another video showed Madonna auditioning for the dancers, while singing an acoustic version of her 2001 single, [...] "Don't Tell Me".|$|E

The game ended when, with 16 seconds left, Simpson dived into the endzone as the ball was knocked out of his hands. It was ruled a touchdown and Virginia defeated Maryland. Terps coach Ralph Friedgen said [...] "I saw the ball come out on the goal line. I saw it and I don't think he had possession." [...] Simpson himself stated, [...] "It crossed the line. I knew I scored because <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> and saw the yellow line and I saw the ball cross [...] they hit it out." [...] With the victory, the Cavaliers reached seven wins in a row {{for the first time since}} 1990 and for only the fourth time in school history. They also accomplished the feat in 1914 and 1949. That season, Virginia won an NCAA record of five games by two points or less, with the other edged teams being North Carolina, Middle Tennessee State, Connecticut, and Wake Forest.|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>down</b> there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right into my face. He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
