During 1985 - 1999 we find that <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>funds</b> return less on average than passive benchmarks that don't pay expenses, but not in all economic states. <b>Fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>funds</b> typically do poorly when short term interest rates or industrial capacity utilization rates are high, and offer higher returns when quality-related credit spreads are high. We find more heterogeneity across fund styles than across characteristics-based fund groups. Mortgage funds underperform a GNMA index in all economic states. These excess returns are reduced, and typically become insignificant, when we adjust for risk using the models...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{growth of}} the {{investment}} funds industry in Brazil and its international representativeness indicate the relevance of analyzing this sector. Literature has shown the effects that market factors can have {{on the performance of}} investment funds. One way of evaluating the relation between funds' returns and market factors' variations is the return-based style analysis. In this context, this research aimed to investigate, through the style analysis, the exposition to various market factors in two modalities of investment funds. With this analysis, we may infer differences between the allocations and the composition of portfolios, constructing a panorama of sensitivity of funds' returns to the market factors addressed in the study. The database consisted of daily returns of 508 funds, out of which 385 are <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>funds</b> and 123 are Neutral Long & Short multimarket funds, within the period from January 3, 2005, to July 11, 2014. Through the style analysis, with 6 market factors, we found a difference between the composition of portfolios of multimarket funds and portfolios of <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>funds.</b> Regarding the evolution of the composition of portfolios in these funds, we observed that the investment style of funds {{does not seem to be}} constant over time, something which may be a positive evidence concerning the changes that managers promote in their portfolios, seeking to achieve better profitability indicators...|$|R

We argue that credit risks create hedging costs for <b>fixed</b> <b>income</b> <b>fund</b> managers, thus, giving rise to home bias which {{has the effect of}} partially segmenting international bond markets. As the hedging costs fall it becomes more attractive to invest in foreign bonds. This reduces home bias and increases integration of international bond markets.
