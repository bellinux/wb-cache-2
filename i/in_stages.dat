40|$|Background. In {{the frame}} of a {{nationwide}} study of oropharyngeal carcinoma in the Netherlands (1986 - 1990), the current International Union Against Cancer 1992 /American joint Committee on Cancer 1988 staging system was evaluated with respect to patient distribution and prognostic value. Methods. Data related to epidemiology, treatment and survival from 640 patients referred for primary treatment were analyzed. Staging was first evaluated in a proportional-hazard regression analysis controlled for these data. Next, all possible combinations of T, N, and M were tested in a stepwise backward elimination model until all remaining indicator variables had a P value of less than 0. 05. New stages were defined, based on the coefficients of the remaining indicator variables. Results. The revised stages revealed two advantages compared with the UICC 1992 /AJCC 1988 version: a more balanced distribution of patients (31 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> I, 31 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> II, 18 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> III, 14 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> IV, and 5 % unknown <b>in</b> the revised <b>staging</b> system versus 7 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> I, 17 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> II, 24 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> III, 50 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> IV, and 2 % unknown in the UICC 1992 /AJCC 1988 staging system), and an improved prognostic discrimination for the disease specific survival (5 -year results <b>in</b> the revised <b>staging</b> were 67 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> I, 42 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> II, 28 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> III, and 11 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> IV, versus 68 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> I, 64 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> II, 44 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> III and 27 % <b>in</b> <b>Stage</b> IV <b>in</b> UICC 1992 /ATCC 1988). Conclusion. Improvements <b>in</b> the current <b>staging</b> system <b>in</b> patient distribution <b>in</b> the <b>stages</b> <b>in</b> prognostic discrimination is feasible by regrouping the T, N, and M but without redefining the categories themselves...|$|R
