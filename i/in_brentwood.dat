5|$|The Peasants' Revolt, {{also called}} Wat Tyler's Rebellion or the Great Rising, {{was a major}} {{uprising}} across large parts of England in 1381. The revolt had various causes, including the socio-economic and political tensions generated by the Black Death in the 1340s, the high taxes resulting from the conflict with France during the Hundred Years' War, and instability within the local leadership of London. The final trigger for the revolt was the intervention of a royal official, John Bampton, in Essex on 30 May 1381. His attempts to collect unpaid poll taxes <b>in</b> <b>Brentwood</b> ended in a violent confrontation, which rapidly spread across the south-east of the country. A wide spectrum of rural society, including many local artisans and village officials, rose up in protest, burning court records and opening the local gaols. The rebels sought a reduction in taxation, {{an end to the}} system of unfree labour known as serfdom and the removal of the King's senior officials and law courts.|$|E

5|$|The {{revolt of}} 1381 {{broke out in}} Essex, {{following}} the arrival of John Bampton to investigate non-payment of the poll tax on 30 May. Bampton {{was a member of}} Parliament, a Justice of the Peace and well-connected with royal circles. He based himself <b>in</b> <b>Brentwood</b> and summoned representatives from the neighbouring villages of Corringham, Fobbing and Stanford-le-Hope to explain and make good the shortfalls on 1 June. The villagers appear to have arrived well-organised, and armed with old bows and sticks. Bampton first interrogated the people of Fobbing, whose representative, Thomas Baker, declared that his village had already paid their taxes, and that no more money would be forthcoming. When Bampton and two sergeants attempted to arrest Baker, violence broke out. Bampton escaped and retreated to London, but three of his clerks and several of the Brentwood townsfolk who had agreed to act as jurors were killed. Robert Bealknap, the Chief Justice of the Court of Common Pleas, who was probably already holding court in the area, was empowered to arrest and deal with the perpetrators.|$|E
