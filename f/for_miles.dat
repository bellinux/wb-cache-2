5|$|Bulls have a loud vocalization {{consisting}} of screams known as bugling, {{which can be}} heard <b>for</b> <b>miles.</b> Bugling {{is often associated with}} an adaptation to open environments such as parklands, meadows, and savannas, where sound can travel great distances. Females are attracted to the males that bugle more often and have the loudest call. Bugling is most common early and late in the day {{and is one of the}} most distinctive sounds in nature, akin to the howl of the gray wolf.|$|E
50|$|ND 18 enters Hatton {{two miles}} south of the county line. The highway travels south <b>for</b> eight <b>miles</b> before {{beginning}} a concurrency with ND 200. The highway travels south <b>for</b> a <b>mile,</b> east <b>for</b> a <b>mile</b> and a half, southeast <b>for</b> a <b>mile,</b> and east <b>for</b> another <b>mile</b> before entering Portland. The highway travels east <b>for</b> a <b>mile</b> before entering Mayville. In Mayville, the concurrency with ND 200 ends and ND 18 begins traveling south once more. The route heads south <b>for</b> ten <b>miles</b> and then east for five before entering Blanchard. Eight {{miles south of}} Blanchard, ND 18 enters Cass County.|$|R

5|$|In 1989 {{a project}} {{commenced}} to re-introduce the country's rarest amphibian, the natterjack toad, to Hengistbury Head. The natterjack was last recorded on the headland in the 1950s before its extinction, probably {{as the result}} of a lack of suitable ponds. The project has been a great success, and today there are thriving populations at various locations. The ideal time to witness their mating rituals is in May as dusk approaches, when the distinctive call of the natterjack can be heard <b>for</b> <b>miles</b> around.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, Nassau County Legislator David Denenberg {{demonstrated}} {{with ten}} civic leaders {{in front of}} the NYSDOT building in East Meadow about the slow progress of construction on the NY102 (Front Street) overpass. Construction was causing rush hour traffic to back up <b>for</b> <b>miles</b> near the Hempstead Turnpike (NY24) exit, and evidence showed no work had been done for several months. After residents and commuters started demanding answers, NYSDOT stated that a project that began as just basic bridge repair had become a larger-scale project that required a redesign {{due to the fact that}} the bridge had more damage than initially realized.|$|E
5|$|Open world, 3D action-adventure games {{existed for}} {{years prior to}} the release of any similar game from the Scottish {{developer}} DMA Design. Mercenary (1985) {{has been described as a}} major ancestor to the Grand Theft Auto series, because it featured an open world which the player could explore freely. The Terminator, released in 1990, was a free-form, open world game that set its action in a modern-day city that extended <b>for</b> <b>miles,</b> and included the ability to fire at civilians and steal cars. This game was also among the first American-developed games to feature these elements.|$|E

5|$|The line winds {{south from}} Llanhilleth <b>for</b> <b>miles</b> (4.5km), past {{the village of}} Crumlin, to the next station at Newbridge, at {{the eastern end of}} Newbridge town centre. Newbridge station {{provides}} Park and Ride car park and bus interchange facilities. To enable the additional service between Ebbw Vale and Newport to begin dual track would need to be laid and second platforms constructed at Llanhilleth and Newbridge stations, allowing trains to pass each other.|$|E
5|$|The nearby hill forts of Figsbury Ring, Quarley Hill, and Bury Hill were {{probably}} established {{around the same}} time as Danebury. All of a similar size, the hillforts were generally equally spaced, commanding similar sized territories and resources. There is some debate whether hill forts were purely defensive structures, and to what extent they were occupied. Cunliffe interprets the ramparts as essentially defensive, although he concedes that they may have been a means of displaying wealth and power, as Danebury would have been visible <b>for</b> <b>miles</b> around.|$|E
5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately spits out the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove <b>for</b> <b>miles.</b> Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010 {{the three}} lakes flooded into one lake, [...] leaving Highway 299 west of Highway 17 {{underwater}} and damaged <b>for</b> 2.5 <b>miles.</b> Highway 518 (Ideal Road) was underwater <b>for</b> one <b>mile</b> south of Highway 415, and Highway 415 west of Inwood, Manitoba was underwater <b>for</b> 2-3 <b>miles.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Cass County, ND 18 travels south <b>for</b> three <b>miles</b> before {{entering}} Hunter. Six miles farther south, the highway heads through Arthur. Fourteen {{miles south of}} Arthur, the route turns east and enters Casselton. Turning south again, ND 18 travels <b>for</b> two <b>miles</b> before sharing an interchange with Interstate 94 and US 52. Nine miles south of this interchange, the road heads west <b>for</b> a <b>mile</b> and then south <b>for</b> six <b>miles</b> to enter Leonard. Two miles south of Leonard, ND 18 begins a concurrency with ND 46 along the Cass-Richland county line <b>for</b> five <b>miles.</b> After this concurrency, the highway heads south into Richland County.|$|R
50|$|The first three-mile {{section of}} the line from Freshwater {{followed}} easy gradients, but then a climb of 1 in 64 followed <b>for</b> a <b>mile,</b> {{and that was the}} ruling gradient <b>for</b> six <b>miles</b> to beyond Watchingwell.

5|$|Life Is People is {{the fourth}} studio album by English singer, pianist and {{songwriter}} Bill Fay, released by Dead Oceans in August 2012. Fay had been without a record label after being dropped by Deram Records following the release of his second album, Time of the Last Persecution in 1971, and could not secure a release for his third album Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow. In order to support himself, Fay took various jobs outside of the music industry, while continuing to record music at home. In 1998, Fay's first two albums were reissued on compact disc by British record label See <b>for</b> <b>Miles</b> Records, prompting a revival of interest in his work, and Tomorrow, Tomorrow & Tomorrow was finally released in 2005.|$|E
5|$|Perennial and {{seasonal}} streams often {{are lined with}} live oak and sycamore, which transition into the riparian zones of the main stem Santa Ana River. The inland riparian marshes upstream of the Riverside/Orange County line, although degraded by pollution, have otherwise been mostly left in their natural state. Although much of the riparian system along the river has been degraded, {{one of the largest}} places where it occurs is the enormous marsh behind Prado Dam, an area closed to development because it functions as a flood control basin, similar to the Sepulveda Dam. The Santa Ana sucker, a small bottom-dwelling fish, once was found throughout riparian zones, but now is rarely seen in the Santa Ana River drainage. Near the mouth, the river was once abundant in salt marshes, which stretched <b>for</b> <b>miles</b> {{on either side of the}} river, even near Upper Newport Bay, which has also served as an alternate mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|The coast path then reaches St Alban's Head, just to {{the south}} of the village of Worth Matravers. Between St Alban's Head and the resort of Swanage is Durlston Country Park nature reserve. North of Swanage is the chalk Ballard Down, the eastern tip of which has been eroded to form Old Harry Rocksâ a series of stacks, arches and caves jutting into the sea between Swanage Bay and Studland Bay. This {{headland}} marks the end of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Behind Studland beach, an extensive system of sand dunes have formed a psammosere, stretching <b>for</b> <b>miles</b> across the Studland peninsula. The peninsula forms one shore of Poole Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world. Part of Studland beach is the National Trust's only official naturist beach. The South West Coast Path ends at South Haven Point, where there is a commemorative marker. The Sandbanks Ferry links this to the Sandbanks area of Poole on {{the eastern edge of the}} harbour.|$|E

5|$|Coral reefs {{are some}} of the most biodiverse {{habitats}} on earth supporting large numbers of species, not just of corals but also of fish, molluscs, worms, arthropods, starfish, sea urchins, other invertebrates and algae. Because of the photosynthetic requirements of the corals, they are found in shallow waters, and many of these fringe land masses. With a three-dimensional structure, coral reefs are very productive ecosystems; they provide food for their inhabitants, hiding places of various sizes to suit many organisms, perching places, barriers to large predators and solid structures on which to grow. They are used as breeding grounds and as nurseries by many species of pelagic fish, and they influence the productivity of the ocean <b>for</b> <b>miles</b> around. Anthazoans prey on animals smaller than they are and are themselves eaten by such animals as fish, crabs, barnacles, snails and starfish. Their habitats are easily disturbed by outside factors which unbalance the ecosystem. In 1989, the invasive crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) caused havoc in American Samoa, killing 90% of the corals in the reefs.|$|E
5|$|The armies {{remained}} in their encampments {{for the campaign}} season while men and horses ate all the provisions and forage <b>for</b> <b>miles.</b> Prince Henry wrote to his brother, suggesting they complete their operations by 22 August, at which time he estimated he would have exhausted local supplies of food for his men and fodder for his horses. Frederick agreed. He laid plans to cross the Elbe and approach the Austrian force from the rear, but the more he examined the conditions of Joseph's entrenchments, the more he realized the campaign was already lost. Even if he and Henry executed simultaneous attacks on the KÃ¶niggrÃ¤tz heights, such a plan exposed Henry to a flanking attack from Laudon. A coordinated frontal and rear assault was also unlikely to succeed. Even if it did, the Prussian losses would be unacceptable and would demolish his army's capacity to resist other invaders. From Frederick's perspective, the Russians and the Swedes were always ready {{to take advantage of}} any perceived Prussian weakness, and the French also could not be trusted to keep their distance. For Frederick, it was a risk not worth taking. Despite this realization, the four armiesâtwo Austrian, two Prussianâ{{remained in}} place until September, eating as much of the country's resources as they could.|$|E
