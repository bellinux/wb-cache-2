40|$|The Central Bank of Sri Lanka has {{increasingly}} been relying {{on interest rates}} as the instrument for conducting monetary policy. Changes to the key monetary policy variables, the Repo and the Reverse Repo rates, are initially expected to {{be reflected in the}} OMO rates and the call money market rates, before being passedthrough to commercial bank retail interest rates. It is important to obtain a good understanding of the speed and magnitude of the interest rate pass-through to make timely monetary policy decisions {{in order to meet the}} objective of economic and price stability. This paper examines the size and speed of the pass-through from policy interest rates to call money market rates and from call money market rates to commercial bank retail interest rates. The paper concludes that the CBSL policy decisions are efficiently transmitted to the short end of the money market within a matter of days. Also, the pass-through from policy interest rates to the call money market rate is almost complete. However, the pass-through from call money market rates to both lending rates and deposit interest rates of commercial banks is sluggish and incomplete. The only exception is, perhaps, the rates on lending to prime customers, which show a faster and a <b>fuller</b> <b>pass-through.</b> Also, there is no evidence of an asymmetry of pass-through over different phases of the interest rate cycle.

40|$|A {{number of}} recent papers have used policy {{simulations}} from small empirical macro models to assess the efficacy of inflation-forecast targeting. The macro models used to undertake the simulations differ significantly with the assumed degree of openness, an important factor for the analysis. However, the open economy models typically approach the pass-through from exchange rate to import prices and ultimately retail prices in a stylized manner, assuming <b>full</b> and instantaneous <b>pass-through.</b> This paper modifies the open economy macro model presented in Batini and Haldane (1999) to accommodate a variety of pass-through representations, considering time and state-(cycle) -dependent pass-through rules. While the model’s dynamics are affected, the main result of Batini and Haldane – that targeting an inflation forecast dominates targeting current inflation – is robust to the assumed rate of pass-through. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the extent of}} pass-through of exchange rate and tariff changes into import prices using sectoral panel data (at the 2 -digit SITC level) for the post-reform period in India (1990 - 2001). After having controlled for unobserved effects that might {{have an impact on}} the import prices by using sector dummies, we find that on average exchange rate pass-through (ERPT) is a dominant effect compared to tariff rate pass-through (TRPT) in explaining changes in India’s import prices. The sectoral panel results suggest that the pass-through of exchange rates and tariff rates varies across products. ERPT into import prices is significant in 12 industries, whereas TRPT is significant only in 6 industries, with <b>full</b> <b>pass-through.</b> However, ERPT is incomplete only in 4 industries, but TRPT is incomplete in 36 industries, which means that firms exporting to India more frequently adopt strategies to maintain their market share against tariffs than against exchange rate changes. The sectoral differences in pass-through seem to be related to the sector’s share in total imports and the sector’s effective protection rate. Hence India’s relatively high levels of protection {{have an impact on the}} behaviour of foreign exporters. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{object of}} this study is to assess the role of trade in the {{transmission}} of currency shocks across geographically close countries. The analysis will focus on identifying and comparing the degree of vulnerability of new EU member states from the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) to currency shocks. We interpret the interactions that a centre-periphery model identifies for periphery countries as a possible description of existing interdependencies among CEECs. According to the centre periphery model discussed by Corsetti et al. (1998 b), “if there is no pass-through, then direct bilateral trade links may play a more important role than competition in the third market in determining the transmission of exchange rate shocks in the periphery. If there is <b>full</b> <b>pass-through,</b> a high share of bilateral trade within a region can actually limit the extent of beggar-thy-neighbour effects. ” These effects are emphasised by a high degree of export similarity among the countries in the periphery. As a result of the heterogeneity in pass-through and trade structures, it is very difficult to derive a unitary policy implication on the potential sustainability of the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) II.

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (Chisari, Estache y Romero, 1999) we explored the gains {{of the economy}} of the privatization process and of efficient regulation. This paper elaborates on the effects of the chaotic devaluation that followed a decade of Convertibility Law in Argentina. A the moment of the privatization tariffs were settled in US dollars. After the Peso devaluation, the authorities did not allow to maintain the tariffs in foreign currency to make them affordable for the poor. However, with this specification of tariffs the firms faced a scenario of non sustainability. Therefore, the Argentine government called for a renegotiation of pricing schemes. To assess different alternatives of tariffs, several policy-oriented simulations are performed in order to get insights on existing trade-offs: i) fixed tariffs: no pass-through of the devaluation to customers, which puts in danger the sustainability of the firms; ii) fully flexible tariffs: <b>full</b> <b>pass-through,</b> which puts in danger poor customer and the social interest of permanent connection the electricity, gas, water & sanitation and telecommunications access and use; iii) cross subsidies between rich and poor customers, to compensate for the losses of the firms; iv) reduction or postponements of investments in access, an inter-temporal crosssubsidy.

Empirically, I show that oil price shocks have a large, persistent and statistically significant impact on the US terms of trade. Theoretically, I add oil in the model by Corsetti and Pesenti (2005) and analyse under what conditions the terms of trade plays a relevant role in the international transmission of oil price shocks. With nominal price rigidities and <b>full</b> exchange rate <b>pass-through</b> positive oil price shocks depreciate the currency of the oil importing country. The subsequent negative wealth effect adds to the recessive effect of the supply channel and may trongly reduce the consumption in the oil importing country economy. Without exchange rate pass-through oil shocks transmit to the economy only through the supply channel. The model suggests that a change in the exchange rate pass-through might contribute to explain the evidence of a weaker impact of oil price shocks on the macroeconomic activity in recent times. oil price shocks, macroeconomic interdependence, exchange rate pass-through, propagation, transmission...|$|R
40|$|For a small {{open economy}} {{characterized}} by intermediate goods trade, exchange rate changes affect {{not only the}} relative price of domestic consumption goods to foreign consumption goods, but also the relative price of local input to imported intermediate goods in the trade sector. Therefore, the adjustment role of a flexible exchange rate as an efficient mechanism in face of external shocks {{will be subject to}} the degree of exchange rate pass-through to both imported consumption goods and intermediate goods. In this paper, we develop a small open economy model with intermediate goods trade to investigate the implication of exchange rate pass-through to input prices for economic dynamics and the desirability of flexible exchange rates. Our model shows that in the presence of either terms of trade shocks or non-traded productivity shocks, the degree of exchange rate pass-through to input prices affects the economy more than does the degree of pass-through to goods prices. Furthermore, we find that, compared with the <b>full</b> exchange rate <b>pass-through</b> case, a delayed pass-through to input prices leads to more welfare loss than does a delayed pass-through to goods prices.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{implications}} of EU climate change policy for energy intensive industries. Specifically, it calculates, {{for a range of}} energy-intensive processes and products, the product price increases that would be required to maintain unit profits at present levels, based on likely values of allowance prices in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme up to 2020. For most of the energy- and carbon-intensive products considered here, an allowance price of € 20 per tonne of carbon dioxide would require price increases of between 0. 1 to 5 % to maintain profits, assuming <b>full</b> <b>pass-through</b> of the allowance price along the value chain. Doubling the allowance price to € 40 /tonne would double the required increase. The activities that risk being most challenged by the carbon constraint appear to be container glass production using virgin inputs, primary aluminium production, primary steel production based on the basic oxygen furnace process, and some basic chemicals production. However, the analysis has also shown that for many of these cases alternative production processes exist, based on recycled inputs, for example. The cement sector, although very energy- and carbon-intensive, is relatively little exposed to international competition. Indeed, the paper also investigates in how far it would be possible for the affected activities to pass through cost increases to their clients, by analysing their exposure to domestic and international competition. It concludes that the sectors analysed are typically relatively highly concentrated (sometimes even at the world level) and form parts of vertically integrated and locally-clustered value chains. This tends to increase market entry and exit barriers and, thus, {{to reduce the risk of}} large output losses and delocalisation. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of transmission of international oil prices and domestic oil price pass-through policy on major macroeconomic variables in India {{with the help of}} a macroeconomic policy simulation model. Three major channels of transmission viz. import channel, price channel, and fiscal channel are explored {{with the help of a}} structural macroeconomic framework. The policy option of deregulation of domestic oil prices in the scenario of occurrence of a one-time shock in international oil prices as well as no oil price shock situation analysed through its impact on growth, inflation, fiscal balances and external balances during the 12 th Plan period of 2012 - 13 to 2016 - 17. The simulation results indicate that in the short run the deregulation policy would have adverse impact on the growth as well as on the inflation. But if this policy is complemented with the policy of switching of subsidy bill to capital expenditure it might result in positive growth effects in the medium and long run. Given, the current passthrough policy, one-time oil shock has adverse impact on growth and inflation in the year of shock while it mitigates slowly over time. The model shows that with the oil shock and with current partial pass-through regime, a 10 percent rise in oil prices result in a 0. 6 percent fall in growth while in the <b>full</b> <b>pass-through</b> situation, it can reduce the growth by 0. 9 percent. Overall, the paper argues that the pass-through has differential impact on growth and inflation over the 12 th Plan period. Hence, the policy of oil price deregulation must be carefully weighed and prioritised...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to reexamine empirically the {{relationship}} between long-term interest rates in well integrated ?nancial markets. The analysis focuses on long-term interest rates in the US and Germany and has been carried out within the framework of a ?ve dimensional VAR for the simultaneous determination of short- and long-term interest rates in the US and Germany and the rate of exchange rate depreciation. The results strongly support the existence of a long-run relationship between the long-term German and the longterm US interest rate and imply a <b>full</b> <b>pass-through</b> of changes in the long-term US rate into the corresponding German rate. The analysis also substantiates that the direction of causality goes from the longterm US to the long-term German interest rate. With regard to the possibility of controlling the long end of the market on the part of the Bundesbank, the paper apparently takes on a rather pessimistic view, as there is nothing to indicate a long-run relationship between shortand long-term German interest rates. However, the strong in?uence that short-term German interest rates exhibit on German long-term interest rates in the very short run according to the structural model of this paper, might be taken to indicate that the opposite is the case, as e ects originating from expectations of future short-term interest rates might totally neutralize an unequivocally positive short-run portfolio e ect in the long run. If this is the case, there is nothing strange to the fact that one is unable to identify a long-run relationship between short- and long-term German interest rates. On the contrary, it is exactly what to be expected if the monetary transmission mechanism works appropriately.

40|$|Abstract The {{purchasing}} power parity puzzle, exchange rate disconnection to macroeconomic fundamentals and pricing to market are central issues of international macroeconomics. Recent research {{has suggested that}} these issues can be presented by nonlinear behaviour. In this dissertation, we examine and explain the nonlinearities in the form of regime switching behaviour in real exchange rate series, exchange rate and macroeconomic fundamentals relation and exchange rate pass-through into consumer and import prices. Overall, we find evidence that nonlinearities are important in analysing empirical exchange rate models. The dissertation consists of four self-contained empirical studies. In chapter 2 we examine whether the Markov switching models and exponential smooth transition autoregressive models can give any additional insights into real exchange rate behaviour for several OECD countries. The results show that there are long swings in the real exchange rate series, which can be characterize as a depreciation and an appreciation regime. These regimes are very persistent, although the processes are eventually mean reverting. We estimate a multivariate smooth transition autoregressive model for the euro/dollar exchange rate in chapter 3. The significant point of our analysis is the possibility that a nonlinear specification for the exchange rate series might reveal aspects of the exchange rate dynamics that cannot be picked up by linear models. We find that the euro/dollar exchange rate may display random walk or near random walk behaviour within a certain range but the ability of the exchange rate to wander without any bound is limited by long-term government bond interest rate differentials. In chapter 4 we examine nonlinear relationships between macroeconomic fundamentals and exchange rate for G- 7 countries. We estimate a smooth transition error correction model that allows for parameter variation in the error correction form and interest rate differentials. The nonlinearity is determined by the inflation rate differentials between countries. We find significant error correction terms in monetary models. Our findings suggest the importance of nonlinear dynamics for examining deviations from the long-run equilibrium. We examine whether the degree of exchange rate pass-through is dependent on importing country inflation rate in chapter 5. Our model shows that import prices respond differently to exchange rate changes when we are in a high inflation regime compared to a low inflation regime. We also present empirical evidence by estimating pass-through elasticises for several OECD countries. We find that consumer prices are not very sensitive to exchange rate changes. For aggregate import prices, we find partial or <b>full</b> exchange rate <b>pass-throughs.</b> The tested nonlinear regime specific models proved appropriate for testing exchange rate dynamics for several currency pairs. Furthermore, we were able to present that macroeconomic fundamentals are important predictors of exchange rates...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} combines three projects, each analyzing how {{markets or}} individuals respond to different policy or environmental changes in low and middle income countries. Each study theoretically motivates the hypotheses {{of interest and}} combines novel data {{from a wide range}} of sources to test them. The first chapter examines the role of prices of foods, rich in different nutrients in the obesity and diet-related disease epidemic in Mexico. In response to the growing epidemic of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases, a number of governments are proposing taxes designed to reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods and thereby improve health outcomes. In this paper, I provide the first estimates of the effects of price changes of foods rich in sugar on the prevalence of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. The analysis is made possible by rich longitudinal and nationally representative micro data on food prices and objective measures of health outcomes in Mexico for the period 1996 - 2010. I employ a unique bar-coded level price dataset with product-specific nutritional information combined with two datasets on health outcomes: (1) a state-level administrative dataset and (2) an individual panel dataset. Exploiting plausibly exogenous within-state variation in prices over time, I show that a decrease in the price of sugar-rich foods significantly increases the prevalence of abdominal obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. In addition, the least healthy and most impatient individuals seem to be more responsive to price changes, suggesting that time preferences are an important mechanism driving the results. Overall, the effect of sugar prices on the incidence of chronic diseases is large. Since the signing of NAFTA, I estimate that the reduction in prices of sugar-rich foods explains 20 percent of the increase in diabetes. The second chapter, joint work with Paul J. Gertler, identifies how junk food and soda taxes are passed through to consumer prices. I use a unique bar-code level price dataset with product-specific nutritional information and the introduction of junk food and soda taxes in Mexico in January 2014 to assess whether and how the excess tax burden is split between consumers and producers. Preliminary results suggests that pass-through is the strongest for sodas, followed by snacks, candy and cakes. For these products a <b>full</b> <b>pass-through</b> materializes within six months after the introduction of the tax. On average, the tax is not fully passed through to consumer prices in the case of cereal and cookies. However, the pass through is increasing over time for the latter, reaching a <b>full</b> <b>pass-through</b> by May 2014. We also observe large variation in pass-through across cities - from over to under shifting; hence observing decreases in consumer prices as well. Using price elasticities of health from Gracner (2015), a one time introduction of junk food and soda taxes in Mexico would imply approximately one and a half percentage point decrease in abdominal obesity and between a quarter to one half of a percentage point decrease in type II diabetes prevalence, under the assumption of a symmetric response to a price change. The third chapter, based on joint work with Paul J. Gertler, Marco Gonzalez-Navarro, and Alex D. Rothenberg, provides evidence of the effects of road quality on local economic activity using temporal variation generated by maintenance investments in roads. A long panel of firms and households allows us to shed light on the effects of road quality for pre-existing households and firms. Methodologically, we propose a new road quality instrument using a nationwide panel dataset of road surface roughness to predict road quality from temporal variation in budgets exogenously allocated to different road maintenance authorities. We first show that higher road network quality improves household consumption and income. We then show that this is partly due to job creation in the manufacturing sector. Third, we show evidence of an occupational shift from agriculture into manufacturing and higher profits for those who stay in agriculture. The gap in average income between agriculture and manufacturing employment is reduced with road quality but not eliminated. Because wages in the manufacturing sector do not change with road quality the results are consistent with dual labor markets in Indonesia...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{intends to}} explore asymmetries {{in the price}} {{development}} {{as a response to}} value-added tax (VAT) changes using a micro-level CPI data set of Hungary. VAT changes 1 provide a valuable source of information, as these kind of exogenous cost push shocks influence a large number of firms simultaneously and in an easily measurable way. What makes the Hungarian data especially interesting is the natural experiment provided by two major VAT increases and a major VAT decrease within 2 years time. The fiscal authorities increased the medium VAT tax rate of 12 % by 3 %-points in January 2004, and again by 5 % points in September 20062, and de-creased the 25 % highest tax rate by 5 % point in January 2006. The observed reactions to these sizable VAT changes can not be well ex-plained by the standard Calvo model assuming exogenous probability of price changes and small shocks, but seem to be in line with the predictions of menu cost models. The data implies that the average frequency of price adjustment of affected products has increased from around 20 % to almost 60 % in case of the VAT increase and to over 35 % in case of the VAT decrease. Furthermore, the average size of price changes has decreased from the average of 13 % to below 10 % in case of the VAT increase and from the average of 12 % to below 8 % in case of the price decrease. These latter facts suggest that the VAT changes induced firms with prices not that far from their optimal price – which normally would not have triggered a price change – to adjust their prices potentially {{as a result of the}} increased loss they could expect as more firms adjusted their prices. Preliminary panel analysis of the data (Gabriel-Reiff, 2007), furthermore, shows a highly asymmetric inflation effect of the VAT changes. The 3 % point increase of the 12 % VAT tax rate in January 2004 had a 2. 24 % overall inflation effect, even though the <b>full</b> <b>pass-through</b> would imply a 2. 68 % effect 3, while th...|$|E
