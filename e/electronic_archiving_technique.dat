40|$|This diploma thesis {{leads us}} through the main points of making a {{coherent}} legal electronic archive: from law, by means of various information technologies, to the final service of <b>electronic</b> <b>archiving.</b> In the introduction we will briefly explain {{the reason for the}} emergence of <b>electronic</b> <b>archives</b> and the law that is related to it. In the second chapter we will introduce to the basic archiving functions, applicable to both classical and <b>electronic</b> <b>archiving.</b> We will answer to questions such as "Why use an electronic archive?", list its good sides, bad sides and goals. The third chapter gives us an overview over the law ZVDAGA, which gives us instructions and guidance for the realization of a coherent legal <b>electronic</b> <b>archive.</b> We will review the content of the law, its internal rules and the compliance with other laws and standards. We will also describe software and hardware requirements and the appropriate media and formats for <b>electronic</b> <b>archiving.</b> In the fourth chapter we will describe the technologies, tools, services and systems that forms a concrete example of a coherent legal <b>electronic</b> <b>archive</b> eHramba. si. We will comprehend service-oriented architecture and related IBM WebSphere software packages. We will walk through the basics of distributed systems, SOAP technology and other blocks which form the affected system. The fifth chapter describes the system architecture of eHramba. si. We will show how individual technologies are connected and linked together and what is their function in the system. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, an {{intelligent}} algorithm for optimal document archiving is presented. It is kown that <b>electronic</b> <b>archives</b> {{are very important}} for information system management. Minimizing {{the size of the}} stored data in <b>electronic</b> <b>archive</b> is a main issue to reduce the physical storage area. Here, the effect of different types of Arabic fonts on <b>electronic</b> <b>archives</b> size is discussed. Simulation results show that PDF is the best file format for storage of the Arabic documents in <b>electronic</b> <b>archive.</b> Furthermore, fast information detection in a given PDF file is introduced. Such approach uses fast neural networks (FNNs) implemented in the frequency domain. The operation of these networks relies on performing cross correlation in the frequency domain rather than spatial one. It is proved mathematically and practically that the number of computation steps required for the presented FNNs is less than that needed by conventional neural networks (CNNs). Simulation results using MATLAB confirm the theoretical computations...|$|R

Both laws covers methods to capture and convert material to a digital format, how to destroy the original material, and outline measures for individuals preparing captured media via various electronic hardware and software. I also explored {{advantages and disadvantages of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>archive,</b> way of capturing paper documents, different types of electronic document formats and how is taken care of security. While <b>electronic</b> <b>archiving</b> systems are often "provider-sided", there are other options, including self-hosted server options. In this thesis I explored the concepts of cloud computing, (advantages vs. disadvantages), service models and deployment models (Public, Private, Community, Hybrid). I was able to meet with some Slovenian providers of <b>electronic</b> <b>archiving</b> and been introduced to their archiving systems. This experience has allowed me to compare and argue the best suitable archiving system for companies with a projected paper usage of + 200 documents per month...|$|R
