She did not make her accusation public, but told a niece that [...] "no boy was safe, from the stable hands to the kitchen help. He slept quite openly with them all." [...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard of trouble in the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Titanic indeed had a [...] list to port leaving Southampton. [...] Inadequate {{trimming}} {{of cargo}} and bunkers would likely result in such {{and the crew}} seems to have demonstrated a lack of proficiency on several occasions. [...] A list to port was noted by several Titanic survivors including Lawrence Beesley who wrote in his book about the sinking: [...] "I then called the attention of our table {{to the way the}} Titanic listed to port (<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> this before), and we watched the skyline through the portholes as we sat at the purser's table in the saloon." [...] (The dining saloon windows were double rows of portholes covered on the inside with screens of leaded decorative glass with no clear view of the outdoors.) [...] This was echoed by [...] survivor Norman Chambers, who testified that after the collision: [...] "However, there was then a slight list to starboard, with probably a few degrees in pitch; and as the ship had a list to port nearly all afternoon, I decided to remain up." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{summer of}} the year 1783 was an amazing and portentous one, and full of horrible phaenomena; for besides the {{alarming}} meteors and tremendous thunder-storms that affrighted and distressed the different counties of this kingdom, the peculiar haze, or smokey fog, that prevailed for many weeks in this island, and {{in every part of}} Europe, and even beyond its limits, was a most extraordinary appearance, unlike anything known within the memory of man. By my journal I find that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> this strange occurrence from June 23 to July 20 inclusive, during which period the wind varied to every quarter without making any alteration in the air. The sun, at noon, looked as blank as a clouded moon, and shed a rust-coloured ferruginous light on the ground, and floors of rooms; but was particularly lurid and blood-coloured at rising and setting. All the time the heat was so intense that butchers' meat could hardly be eaten on the day after it was killed; and the flies swarmed so in the lanes and hedges that they rendered the horses half frantic, and riding irksome. The country people began to look, with a superstitious awe, at the red, louring aspect of the sun; ...|$|E

2500|$|... “Many of the Indians {{would want}} to go out and buy {{trinkets}} and things to carry back home, such as nice blankets and shawls. [...] But during the rainy weather some of them thought they had an excuse to drink. [...] They said they thought it kept them warm. [...] I saw at once that this must not go on, as a little whiskey always calls for more. [...] So I called all the Indians together in council, and explained to them that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> they were beginning to look for liquor again and that it was not good for them. [...] Then I said: “I am going to make a new rule with you. [...] Every man and woman hereafter will receive only half their pay. [...] The balance will be kept in my care until near the end of the season. [...] Then those of you who think you must be spending your money all the time will have something to take home with you when your work is done.’ [...] Some, of course, did not like this plan. [...] While they knew it was for their best interest, still they did not want to do without their liquor. [...] But the majority fell right in with my proposition. [...] They knew I would be honest with them, and that their money was safe with me. [...] So it was agreed that on each pay day half of the money should be put away until the show closed. [...] Further, each man was warned that he must be more careful about drinking.” ...|$|E
2500|$|After Goforth’s {{address the}} first morning an elder stood up before all the people and confessed to having embezzled church funds. The effect on the hearers was “instantaneous”. One person gave a [...] “piercing cry” then many, now in tears, began {{spontaneous}} prayer and confession. For three days these incidents continued. Goforth recorded, [...] "On the fourth morning an unusually large congregation had assembled. The people seemed tense, expectant… Just then the hymn ended, and I rose to speak. All through that address I was acutely conscious {{of the presence of}} God. Concluding, I said to the people: [...] "You may pray." [...] Immediately a man left his seat and, with bowed head and tears streaming down his cheeks, came up {{to the front of the}} church and stood facing the congregation. It was the elder who, two days before, had given vent to that awful cry. As if impelled by some power quite beyond himself, he cried out: [...] "I have committed adultery. I have tried three times to poison my wife." [...] Whereupon he tore off the golden bracelets on his wrist and the gold ring from his finger and placed them on the collection plate, saying: [...] "What have I, an elder of the Church, to do with these baubles?" [...] Then he took out his elder's card, tore it into pieces and threw the fragments on the floor. [...] "You people have my cards in your homes," [...] he cried. [...] "Kindly tear them up. I have disgraced the holy office. I herewith resign my eldership." [...] For several minutes after this striking testimony no one stirred. Then, one after another, the entire session rose and tendered their resignations. The general burden of their confession was: [...] "Though we have not sinned as our brother has, yet we, too, have sinned, and are unworthy to hold the sacred office any longer." [...] Then, the deacons one by one got up and resigned from their office. [...] "We, too, are unworthy," [...] they confessed. For days <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>noticed</b> how the floor in front of the native pastor was wet with tears. He now rose and in broken tones said, [...] "It is I who am to blame. If I had been what I ought to have been, this congregation would not be where it is to day. I'm not fit to be your pastor any longer. I, too, must resign." [...] Then there followed one of the most touching scenes that I have ever witnessed. From different parts of the congregation the cry was heard: [...] "It's all right, pastor. We appoint you to be our pastor." [...] The cry was taken up until it seemed as if every one was endeavouring to tell the broken man standing there on the platform that their faith and confidence in him had been completely restored. There followed a call for the elders to stand up; and as the penitent leaders stood in their places, with their heads bowed, the spontaneous vote of confidence was repeated, [...] "Elders, we appoint you to be our elders." [...] Then came the deacons' turn. [...] "Deacons, we appoint you to be our deacons." [...] Thus were harmony and trust restored. That evening the elder whose confession had had such a marked effect was remonstrated with by one of his friends. [...] "What made you go and disgrace yourself and your family like that?" [...] he was asked. [...] "Could I help it?" [...] he replied." ...|$|E
