25|$|In recent years, CIMS {{has also}} been {{recognised}} as best practice for implementing management structures for response and recovery. Many organisations outside those identified above are now adopting CIMS - including lifeline utilities, universities, and businesses. The <b>key</b> <b>benefits</b> are adopting a recognised standard, {{and being able to}} interoperate with other agencies during response to complex events that involve more than one agency.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, a {{page fault}} may {{indicate}} a software bug, {{which can be}} prevented by using memory protection as one of <b>key</b> <b>benefits</b> of an MMU: an operating system {{can use it to}} protect against errant programs by disallowing access to memory that a particular program should not have access to. Typically, an operating system assigns each program its own virtual address space.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2011 census, 78.2% {{of males}} aged 16–64 and females aged 16–59 in Barrow were {{economically}} active. This figure {{is higher than}} the North West and England averages. 73.8% of the population was employed, which again is higher than regional and national averages; the unemployment rate stood at 5.6% which is lower than both averages. Despite this the percentage of people claiming <b>key</b> <b>benefits,</b> which is independent of the unemployment figure, is much higher than both averages at 21.0%, or almost a quarter of all Barrovians of working age. The most common form of benefit received was the Incapacity Benefit, claimed by 11.0% of the adult population, while 4.0% claimed Jobseeker's Allowance, which is {{on a par with the}} national average.|$|E

25|$|Membrane bioreactors (MBR) are {{activated}} sludge systems using a membrane liquid-solid phase separation process. The membrane component uses low pressure microfiltration or ultrafiltration membranes and {{eliminates the need}} for a secondary clarifier or filtration. The membranes are typically immersed in the aeration tank; however, some applications utilize a separate membrane tank. One of the <b>key</b> <b>benefits</b> of an MBR system is that it effectively overcomes the limitations associated with poor settling of sludge in conventional {{activated sludge}} (CAS) processes. The technology permits bioreactor operation with considerably higher mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration than CAS systems, which are limited by sludge settling. The process is typically operated at MLSS in the range of 8,000–12,000mg/L, while CAS are operated in the range of 2,000–3,000mg/L. The elevated biomass concentration in the MBR process allows for very effective removal of both soluble and particulate biodegradable materials at higher loading rates. Thus increased sludge retention times, usually exceeding 15 days, ensure complete nitrification even in extremely cold weather.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, Network Rail {{launched}} a consultation on large-scale electrification, potentially {{to include the}} Great Western Main Line and Midland Main Line and smaller [...] "in-fill" [...] schemes. <b>Key</b> <b>benefits</b> cited were that electric trains are faster, more reliable and cause less track wear than diesel trains. Since then, electrification of the Great Western Main Line has been approved; electric trains are planned to run to Bristol from 2016 and Cardiff from 2017. Electrification of the Midland Main Line, several Trans-Pennine routes and the Welsh Valleys has also been approved.|$|E
2500|$|As DVD players {{dropped in}} price, so did PCs and their related video {{processing}} and storage capabilities. In 2000, DVD decryption software using the DeCSS algorithm let DVD owners consolidate their DVD video libraries on hard-drives. Innovations like TiVo and ReplayTV allowed viewers to store and timeshift broadcast content using specialty designed computers. [...] ReplayTV for instance ran on a VxWorks platform. [...] Incorporating these capabilities into PCs was {{well within the}} ability of a computer hobbyist who was willing to build and program these systems. [...] <b>Key</b> <b>benefits</b> of these DIY projects included lower cost and more features. Advancements in hardware identified another weak link: the absence of media management software to make it easy to display and control the video from a distance.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{theorists and}} {{practitioners}} {{argue that the}} positioning statement should be written in a format that includes an identification of the target market, the market need, the product name and category, the <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> delivered and {{the basis of the}} product's differentiation from any competing alternatives. A basic template for writing positioning statements is as follows: [...] "For (target customer) who (statement of the need or opportunity), the (product name) is a (product category) that (statement of <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> - that is, compelling reason to buy). Unlike (primary competitive alternative), our product (statement of primary differentiation)." [...] An annotated example of how this positioning statement might be translated for a specific application appears in the text-box that follows.|$|R
