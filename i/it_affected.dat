5|$|The 1858 San Diego Hurricane is {{the only}} Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone known to have produced hurricane-force winds in California; <b>it</b> <b>affected</b> San Diego on October 2, 1858, though its center remained just offshore. In the 20thcentury, only four tropical cyclones produced tropical storm force winds in the southwestern United States: a tropical storm in September 1939 in California, Hurricane Joanne in October 1972 in Arizona, Hurricane Kathleen in September 1976 in Arizona and California, and Hurricane Nora in September 1997 in Arizona.|$|E

5000|$|Journalist Stephanie Cooke {{says that}} it is not useful to make {{comparisons}} just in terms of number of deaths, as the way people live afterwards is also relevant, {{as in the case of}} the 2011 Japanese nuclear accidents:"You have people in Japan right now that are facing either not returning to their homes forever, or if they do return to their homes, living in a contaminated area for basically ever... <b>It</b> <b>affects</b> millions of people, <b>it</b> <b>affects</b> our land, <b>it</b> <b>affects</b> our atmosphere ... <b>it's</b> <b>affecting</b> future generations ...

5|$|The {{case has}} been cited in {{numerous}} law reviews. Some of these were critical of the majority approach, stating that it went beyond the plain {{meaning of the text}} to open up the federal government to liability where none existed. Other reviews merely analyzed the decision and how <b>it</b> <b>affected</b> government-tribe trust cases. Alex Tallchief Skibine opined that the case was almost unique, and he did not foresee that it would be significant for other tribes.|$|E

As the virus spread, <b>it</b> <b>affected</b> not only humans, but other animals as well, and the environment deteriorated, turning cities into desolate landscapes and the wilderness into wastelands. The real Alice (from whom the clones are made) wanders the wastelands of the Southwestern U.S. She responds to a group asking for help on the radio. It turns out that they are bandits who first attempt to rape her and then have her killed by infected dogs, only for her to unleash them unto her captors. On her travels, she finds a dead man's diary which states that there is an uninfected area in Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Bonnie was a {{long-lived}} {{storm in}} the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season. It {{was the third}} tropical storm (including the April subtropical storm) and second hurricane of the 1992 season. Bonnie formed at high latitudes in the central Atlantic on September 17. Devoid of any real steering currents for much of its lifespan, it was nearly stationary for over {{a week in the}} central Atlantic Ocean. On September 27, it began to slowly track east and northeast towards the Azores. Just before becoming extratropical, <b>it</b> <b>affected</b> the Azores on September 30, although no damage was reported.|$|E
5|$|I think {{a strong}} {{case can be made}} that {{political}} assassination actually does change things. If you look at the assassinations in this country in the 1960s you can certainly see how <b>it</b> <b>affected</b> history in a very profound way. So if you killed right wing figures, you'd also be altering the course of history, and eliminating people who might very well be president in 1996 and those who are making bashing gays their number one issue right now. On the one hand, I'm not advocating PWA's turn themselves into human bombs, {{but on the other hand}} I have to admit that if I clicked on CNN and heard somebody had blown Patrick Buchanan's head clean off, I'd be elated, and to say otherwise would be a lie.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the rural}} ranchers and Cowboys resented the growing {{influence}} of the city residents over county politics and law enforcement. The ranchers largely maintained {{control of the country}} outside Tombstone, {{due in large part to}} the sympathetic support of Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan, who favored the Cowboys and rural ranchers, and who also grew to intensely dislike the Earps. Behan tended to ignore the Earps' complaints about the McLaurys' and Clantons' horse thieving and cattle rustling. The Earps were known to bend the law in their favor when <b>it</b> <b>affected</b> their gambling and saloon interests, which earned them further enmity with the Cowboy faction.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Imperial Valley {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} 16:16 Pacific Daylight Time (23:16 UTC) on October 15 {{just south of}} the Mexico–United States border. <b>It</b> <b>affected</b> Imperial Valley in Southern California and Mexicali Valley in northern Baja California. The earthquake had a relatively shallow hypocenter and caused property damage in the United States estimated at $30 million USD. The irrigation systems in the Imperial Valley were badly affected, but no deaths occurred. It was the largest earthquake to occur in the contiguous United States since the 1971 San Fernando earthquake eight years earlier.|$|E
5|$|The 1995–96 South Pacific cyclone {{season was}} one of the least active South Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone season's on record, with only four tropical cyclones occurring within the South Pacific Ocean to the east of 160°E. The season officially ran from November 1, 1995, until April 30, 1996. The first storm developed on January 12, while the last one dissipated on April 2. During the season the most intense tropical cyclone was Severe Tropical Cyclone Beti, which reached a minimum pressure of 935hPa (27.61inHg) as <b>it</b> <b>affected</b> New Caledonia. After the season ended Beti's name was the only name to be retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists and was replaced with Bune, after it inflicted over 5.6million (USD) worth of damage to Australia, Vanuatu, New Caledonia and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|The Russo-Japanese War {{had caused}} rising dissent {{throughout}} the Russian Empire, including its Polish provinces. On 26 January 1905 about 6,000 workers in Łódź {{took part in}} a large strike. Next day, a general strike was declared, and the day after that, 70,000 workers were on strike. They demanded an 8-hour work day and support for the sick. Some worker demonstrations were joined by the students, who demanded an end to the policy of Russification. Another large strike occurred during the Labor Day on 1 May. <b>It</b> <b>affected</b> close to half of the city's industry. On 3 May, the anniversary of the Polish May Constitution, another demonstration with patriotic undertones took place. On 30 May, Łódź's industrialists asked the Russian governor-general for help.|$|E
5|$|The {{earthquake}} and its precursor tremor struck {{during the afternoon}} near an extremely populated area, with most buildings in the area already left in precarious conditions by previous earthquakes. <b>It</b> <b>affected</b> roughly 400,000 people directly, {{most of whom were}} estimated to have experienced at least strong (MM VI) shaking. Hospital officials confirmed at least 46 injuries after its occurrence; falling debris struck several people, while two others were left in critical condition. In the city centre, two workers had to be rescued from a collapsed church and were promptly hospitalised. The morning after, officials confirmed an elderly man had died after being knocked unconscious in a rest home when the earthquake struck. Mass casualties were avoided owing to a combination of building evacuations prompted by the weaker shock and an epicentre removed from populous areas.|$|E
5|$|The first {{tropical}} cyclone and hurricane of the 1861 season {{is believed to}} have formed on July 6, immediately east of the Leeward Islands. A 1938 publication documented the storm's effects on Guadeloupe and St. Kitts, and given a lack of prior reports on the cyclone, modern-day reassessments concluded that it was relatively weak when <b>it</b> <b>affected</b> those islands. After crossing the northern Leeward Islands, the tropical storm broadly curved toward the northwest, likely intensifying into the equivalence of a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale on July 9. The majority of the storm's track in the western Atlantic was unknown until it was reconstructed based on reports from, and the effects on, three ships in its vicinity.|$|E
