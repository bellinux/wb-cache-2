50|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} in the utilization of the large amounts of surface area on skyscrapers to improve their overall energy efficiency. Because skyscrapers are increasingly ubiquitous in urban environments, yet require large amounts of energy to operate, there is potential for large amounts of energy savings employing passive solar design techniques. One study, which analyzed the proposed 22 Bishopsgate tower in London, found that a 35% energy decrease in demand can theoretically be achieved through indirect solar gains, by rotating the building to achieve optimum ventilation and <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration,</b> usage of high thermal mass flooring material to decrease temperature fluctuation inside the building, and using double or triple glazed low emissivity window glass for direct solar gain. Indirect solar gain techniques included moderating wall heat flow by variations of wall thickness (from 20 to 30 cm), using window glazing on the outdoor space to prevent heat loss, dedicating 15-20% of floor area for thermal storage, and implementing a Trombe wall to absorb heat entering the space. Overhangs are used to block direct sunlight in the summer, and allow it in the winter, and heat reflecting blinds are inserted between the thermal wall and the glazing to limit heat build-up in the summer months.|$|E

Their physical characteristics include many variables, including size, form, and shape; environmental; technological; space type and appropriateness for its intended activity and users; location; and numerous others. A basic tenet of learning spaces housed in buildings {{is to provide}} shelter, although many facilities from campuses to portable classrooms, do not provide shelter between individual spaces. Outdoor learning spaces rely on clothing and personal items to maintain comfort. The location of the learning space affects both its functional and operational interrelationships with other spaces, student and instructor cohorts, learning programs, and support spaces. The proportion of a space's height-width-length can affect the ability of learners to see instructional or demonstration material or the presenter. The orientation of the space towards adjacent spaces or the outdoor environment can affect activities, thermal comfort, as well as <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration</b> (if any) {{at different times of}} the day. Increased demand for flexibility and adaptability have seen greater use of (operable partition walls) to combine and separate spaces. Safety and security in schools, including major incidents of violence, bullying, and vandalism have led to increased use of security monitoring systems, strategies such crime prevention through environmental design (CPTED), and sometimes competing discussions of transparency versus visible lockdown of learning spaces.|$|E
40|$|Lighting {{control is}} one of the key areas for energy saving in {{lighting}} system. Automatic control systems reduce energy consumption by decreasing load and operating time of lamps based on various factors like occupancy, time and daylight illuminance. Daylight-linked control systems can provide substantial savings in rooms with daylight availability. This approach to energy saving is called Daylight Utilization. Different methods to estimate energy savings from daylighting exist. The existing methods use simulations along with complex calculations which are suitable for research projects, but difficult to adopt for electrical designers. Moreover, some issues within these methods prevent them from estimating the maximum potential of savings. Particularly, these methods often consider the whole room as one workplane, whereas in reality the actual task area is considerably smaller. Also, the existing methods take annual average <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration</b> without considering variation of <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration</b> throughout the day or year. These problems lead to inaccurate assessment and ultimately reduced savings. This study aims to develop a new method using simulation data that considers segregation of the workplane and daylight variation for improved daylight utilization assessment. The proposed method uses two approaches to overcome the above problems of previous studies. Firstly, dividing the workplane of the room into task and surrounding area, and associating different illuminance level requirements for the two areas. Secondly, dividing the <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration</b> into three different ranges of daylight illuminance levels, thus taking into account variation in daylight illuminance. The method was applied on the simulated model of a small office room, and the annual savings potential was found to be 83. 67 %. The results show that the proposed method gives estimation of 73. 45 % savings for an office room, which is 10 % higher than the results of an existing method. This shows that the new method is a viable solution for estimation of energy savings potential from daylighting...|$|E

40|$|Daylight control systems, which {{automatically}} adjust the artificial light levels {{depending on the}} <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration,</b> can result in substantial energy savings. However, their energy saving potential cannot be estimated accurately because it depends on several building and system parameters, climate conditions, occupant behaviour and type and commissioning of the daylight control system. The objective {{of this paper is}} to compare the energy saving potential and operation of different daylight control systems in school buildings. One year monitoring has been carried out simultaneously in 3 neighbouring classrooms, equipped with a different type of control system. The active power and the electric energy consumption of the artificial lighting were measured continuously on a minute-by-minute basis, as well as the occupancy of the classrooms and the global irradiance outside the building under an unobstructed horizon. Momentary visual comfort assessments were carried out in the classrooms. Although all classrooms have comparable occupancy and identical building characteristics, differences between the annual energy savings of the different daylight control systems are found to be significant: the total annual energy savings varied from 18 % to 46 %. Under the given conditions, the open loop system with the outward facing daylight sensor was noticed to yield the largest while the closed loop system with centrally positioned sensor produced the smallest savings. However, it has to be made sure that the energy savings are not at the expense of the visual comfort. The performance of the systems regarding both energy savings and visual comfort is related to the operation and the initial commissioning. An in-depth analysis of the monitoring campaign is discussed to explain the differences in energy savings and visual comfort. The energy savings due to the implementation of a daylight control system are divided into on the one hand dimming due to <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration</b> and on the other hand initial dimming to compensate for the over dimensioning of the lighting system and to take into account constant illuminance control. status: publishe...|$|E

In the last years several studies, dealing with the effects of environmental conditions in classrooms in the learning process, have been published (Winterbottom, & Wilkins, 2009; Barret, Zhang, Moffat, & Kobbacy, 2013). The daylight factor (DF) is the most used parameter in the characterization and quantification of daylight in buildings. The DF at a point of a plane inside a room is defined as the ratio (expressed as a percentage) between the daylight illuminance at that point in the interior of the room and the simultaneous exterior horizontal global illuminance due to a hemisphere of a sky of known or assumed luminance distribution (usually, a CIE overcast sky luminance distribution is considered). The DF reflects the effectiveness of <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration</b> in a particular room or space.

To explore a solution for this issue, this paper proposes an advanced integrated lighting system combining different architectural elements, which can be controlled parametrically. The suitable design of such integrated system is identified through a multi-step comparison study employing parametric design approach. The criteria is to keep a relatively uniform daylight distribution in the range of 300 – 500 lux over 90 % of the whole desktop area in a 7 -meter-deep office room. An office building in New Cairo was chosen for a case study, where it is south oriented with a prevailing condition of clear sky.

But a curtain-wall glazing system entirely of electrochromic glazing might not be the most economical solution for effective daylighting and energy efficiency.

The ultimate goal is to study the interaction between electrochromic glazing and traditional shading techniques and identify the optimum configuration(s) that reaps the maximum quantitative and qualitative performance benefits, hence discovering a more sustainable solution while also making a business/ economic case (w. r. t. associated energy savings) of replacing static property glazing with dynamic property electrochromic glazing...|$|E
40|$|Solar shading is an {{important}} element {{not only for the}} purpose of reducing direct solar heat gain, but also for controlling the quality of daylighting and associated glare. The balance between the prevention of heat gains and natural <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration</b> is crucial for energy saving in building cooling and lighting. However, many buildings nowadays do not show proper use of solar shading. One of the main factors is the lack of understanding and proper use of shading design tools or methods. The main objective of this research is to determine the optimum external solar shading geometry for energy efficiency in hot humid tropic. Besides, this research also accesses the application of computer simulation tools for shading design. Two methodologies were employed in this research. The first one was an assessment on computer simulation tools using scaled physical model measurement. Desktop Radiance 2. 0 and VELUX Daylight Visualizer 2. 5 were selected and evaluated for proper application under tropical sky. The second methodology was building energy simulation using e-QUEST- 3. This experiment was to investigate the impact of room geometry, fenestration size and external overhang depth on building energy consumption. The results showed that the highest energy saving achieved was as much as 70 percents. The relationship of the 3 variables was discussed and prediction tool for optimum shading was developed for energy efficiency. Futhur study can be carried out on other types of shading devices and variables such as room height, overhang angle, colour, etc. The findings can be further developed into simplified shading design tool...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{climate of}} Thailand {{is hot and}} humid and {{air-conditioning}} for thermal comfort is used in all tall buildings. Buildings with curtained walling are perceived to possess specific aesthetic value by many developers. As a consequence, such buildings cannot accommodate external shading device. In order to reduce transmission of solar radiation into such building, heat reflective glazing has been popularly used. Inadvertently, the building is subject to high cooling load from high heat gain through the curtained walling. However, as Thailand is located near the equator. For a northern or a southern façade, an exterior horizontal shading device can effectively shade radiation of the sun beam from a window below it while allowing skylight to enter the window to give a soft natural daylight in the room. The use of multiple-slat, sufficiently spaced horizontal shading device on the exterior of a facade on appropriately sized window will allow sufficient view out through the window, enables application of daylighting and reduces cooling load. This paper presents results of {{a study on the}} use of such shading device on windows under different combinations of glazing types, ratios of window area to wall area, and with un-insulated and insulated wall. When diffuse daylight from sky is used for daylighting, glazing that allows more <b>daylight</b> <b>penetration</b> is shown to offer a monetary worth of savings on electric lighting over its cost, and the cost of air-conditioning energy when the value of the ratio of window to wall ratio falls within certain range. The net benefit can be optimized at an appropriate ratio of window to wall area. When wall insulation is applied, the benefit is even enhance...|$|E
