40|$|Landuse {{analyses}} {{continue to}} be the medium for communicating important spatial, spectral, and temporal remote sensing concepts. Unfortunately, hardware and software constraints often limit these activities to the examination of photographic formats of remotely sensed data. Such constraints cause manual interpretation techniques to be given inordinate attention compared to digital image processing. Even when the instructor is actively involved in image processing research, batch-mode processing may dominate. Again the student is confronted with hard-copy, this time in the form of computer printouts. A more effective remote sensing education is realized if students have the opportunity to experience interactive digital image processing. To this end, BASIC+ digital image processing has been implemented at the University of California, Santa Barbara {{as an integral part of}} the Geography Department 2 ̆ 7 s remote sensing curriculum. Students interrogate Landsat images to extract digital number (DN) values, experiment with their own preprocessing algorithms and use Boolean logic classification. Analyses are performed on a 15 x 45 km coastal study area encompassing a diversity of landuses and discrimination problems. This paper first summarizes the image processing system configuration including: 1) Data Acquisition -SUBIMG. (select subimage from scene) 2) Preprocessing -PREPRO. (arithmetic operations, eg. ratio) -SHIFT. (edge enhancement) 3) Class Specific Processing -PTRAIN. (train on preprocessed file) -TRAIN. (train on unpreprocessed file) -TEST. (select test data) 4) Data Analysis -STATS. (parametric statistics) -HISTO. (histogram) -DIVER. (divergence) 5) Classification -PTHEME. (Boolean on preprocessed files) -THEME. (Boolean on unpreprocessed files) 6) Utility -FIXIT. (list DN values; <b>file</b> <b>clean-up)</b> -LOOKC. (grey map) The paper concludes with the results of the student landuse classification experience in the 115 B remote sensing class (the second of a three course sequence). Evaluations include: 1) Student reactions and perceptions a. Innovative preprocessing to optimize classification b. The 2 ̆ 7 real 2 ̆ 7 utility of remote sensing 2) Comparison of student results with LARSYS classifications using both student and researcher training and test data. Overall reactions by students and faculty indicate that the BASIC+ image processing system is effective for both educational and research purposes...|$|E

40|$|PJM Interconnection, L. L. C. (“PJM”) hereby submits for filing revised {{sections}} of the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (“Tariff”) 1. As set forth in greater detail below, {{the purpose of the}} proposed revisions are to clarify that the calculation of Peak Market Activity (“PMA”), which is used to determine a Participant’s required level of financial security to support its activity in the PJM market, shall not exceed the greatest amount invoiced for the Participant’s transaction activity for all PJM markets and services in any rolling one, two or three week period in the previous 52 weeks. PJM respectfully requests that the Commission accept the proposed Tariff revisions for filing, allowing them to become effective March 1, 2011. 2 Additionally, through this <b>filing,</b> a ministerial <b>clean-up</b> to resolve the inadvertent omission of the term “three-week ” in setting forth the appropriate average of all non-zero invoices to be utilized in initial calculation of a Participant’s Peak Market Activity is also included. 1 Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein have the meaning specified in the PJM Operatin...|$|R
40|$|International audienceVAPOR, the Vo Administration and {{operations}} PORtal, intends to help small to medium-size grid user communities to perform common VO administration and operational tasks, at a reduced human cost. Such communities may typically have no or few dedicated IT support, have fragmented user groups, and may use resources either dedicated {{or in an}} opportunistic manner. A large variety of existing tools and portals are available to assist VO managers and support teams. Although generic, {{some of them are}} often designed {{to meet the needs of}} somewhat specific contexts, and their operation requires a solid IT support. VAPOR is designed as a generic, experiment-independent tool. It complements existing tools such as SAM Nagios and the VO Operations Portal with novel services, to assist community managers and support teams in performing their daily activities. It does not require any deployment, since an existing instance of VAPOR is ready to support new VOs. In this session, we shall describe the architecture of the portal, the status of the project (that ended in April 2014), and demonstrate its major features: (i) resources monitoring (reports of resources supporting the VO, status indicators, statistical reports, white list of computing elements), and (ii) community data management (detect and handle SE filling-up, <b>clean-up</b> <b>files</b> of former users, deal with dark data and lost files). Finally, we shall discuss future works and features to be implemented...|$|R
