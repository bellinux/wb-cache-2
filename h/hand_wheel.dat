25|$|Shiremark Mill was a three-storey smock mill on a {{single-storey}} base. There was no stage, earth {{having been}} thrown {{up against the}} base to form a mill mound. It last worked with four double Patent sails carried on a cast-iron windshaft. The cap was winded by a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Dobcross H.K. {{box loom}} was {{manufactured}} in ca.1950 by Hutchinson, Hollingworth & Co. Ltd of Dobcross, Oldham. This loom was claimed by its makers {{to be one}} of the most widely used power looms in the woollen and worsted industries. It was used, with minor adaptations, for weaving goods as varied as light tropical suiting, costume cloths, overcoatings, army and police uniform cloths and heavy blankets. The main feature of this loom is the dobby (located top right of the loom with the <b>hand</b> <b>wheel)</b> which is known as the Knowles, American or positive wheel dobby. This device lifts and lowers the wooden shafts through which the warp ends are threaded, separating the warp threads to produce the shed. The loom has four rising or drop boxes at each side, which can be moved independently, and can weave up to seven shuttles, each with a different colour.|$|E
2500|$|Ashby's Mill is a four-storey brick tower mill with a boat shaped cap. It had two Patent sails and two Common sails. The cap was winded by a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel,</b> no fantail being fitted. The {{cast iron}} windshaft {{is the only}} {{remaining}} original piece of machinery. The mill is [...] diameter at the base and [...] to the curb, and [...] high overall.|$|E

50|$|The electric-hydraulic drives powered the mount's motion. The three {{modes of}} drive {{operation}} were automatic, local, and manual. In automatic, the drives {{would follow the}} bearing and elevation orders of the fire control system. In local, the drives would follow {{the motion of the}} trainer's and pointer's <b>hand</b> <b>wheels.</b> (This is similar to power steering on a car.) Manual was direct gear linkage from the <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> to move the mount with no power assist.|$|R
50|$|Elevating and transversing <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and {{panoramic}} sight are at {{the left}} of the breech. The firing mechanism is a lanyard actuated percussion type.|$|R
2500|$|The cap was winded by a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> of [...] {{diameter}} housed {{just inside}} {{the rear of the}} cap. The worm wheel that engaged with the cogs set into the top of the tower was latterly a cast-iron one, replacing an earlier wooden one. It was necessary to pull about a [...] of chain to turn the mill through 180 degrees.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Time Ball {{consists}} of a cast iron cylinder, piston, rack and pinion lifting mechanism, safety lock, electric motor and ball. The cylinder is 30cm diameter and 3 m long. Approximately 7 litres of soapy water fills {{the bottom of the}} cylinder to act as a buffer for the piston. The piston is a 10cm thick block of rubber with a bleeder valve to adjust the rate of descent. The rack extends from the piston to the Time Ball and is 7.5 meters long. A pinion engages into the rack by a slide gear, which enables the electric motor to raise the rack. A large <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> is also attached with a pawl gear to prevent back-slipping. The Time Ball is attached {{to the top of the}} rack and is raised 2.7 metres.|$|E
50|$|Steering is worm and {{worm wheel}} type. Beneath the <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> {{there is a}} {{convenient}} ring-operated horn switch.|$|E

50|$|In 1929 the {{delicate}} step switches {{were replaced by}} two hopper switches. The old controllers were {{at the same time}} exchanged to normal controllers with horizontal <b>hand</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hands</b> <b>wheels</b> for earlies {{were not}} {{available}} until 1965, so Sprints built before that time were not originally equipped with these wheels. Owners opted to add these wheels later.|$|R
50|$|Fine {{control of}} the {{grinding}} head or table position is possible using a vernier calibrated <b>hand</b> <b>wheel,</b> or using the features of numerical controls.|$|E
50|$|A {{steering}} wheel (also called a driving wheel or a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel)</b> {{is a type}} of steering control in vehicles and vessels (ships and boats).|$|E
50|$|The {{machines}} came in {{a number}} of variants with sliding, <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> or keyboard selected letters. The keyboard models and some rotary select units were motorised to allow faster operation. Modern units are usually electronically controlled with computer interfaces.|$|E
5000|$|Trainer : Controls the mount's train angle (bearing). He sits in {{the right}} front corner of the mount. (See the far right man in the Mk21 open mount picture.) In front of him, are his optical sight, <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and train drive {{controls}}. Between his knees is a large box called the Train Indicator Regulator. (pictured) This box controls the train power drive. On top of the box, is a window {{with a set of}} dials that indicate the train angle of the gun, and the automatic train orders electrically coming from the Fire Control System by synchro. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Match pointers. Switch to Automatic.", he looks down at the dials on his Indicator-Regulator. The dials also tell him the difference between the gun's present train angle and the ordered train angle. He changes the bearing of the gun, by moving his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> until the dial difference is zero. His dials are now [...] "matched", and he switches the train drive into Auto. This disengages his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels,</b> and gives train angle control to the Fire Control System. Then, he reports back to the Mount Captain, [...] "Train in auto." [...] He may now look through his sight, and if the Sight Setter has matched the sight-setter dial pointers, he will see the target in the cross-hairs. When the Mount Captain commands, [...] "Switch to Local", he switches the train drive to local. In local control, he controls the gun's train angle with his <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> to keep his sight's vertical cross hair on the target.|$|R
50|$|Computer {{numerical}} control (CNC) is the automation of machine tools {{by means of}} computers executing pre-programmed sequences of machine control commands. This {{is in contrast to}} machines that are manually controlled by <b>hand</b> <b>wheels</b> or levers, or mechanically automated by cams alone.|$|R

50|$|Since a torque is {{produced}} by {{the interaction of the}} magnetic fields, the movable element is held by a mechanism such as a worm gear. The rotor may be rotated by a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> attached to the machine, or an electric motor can be used to remotely or automatically adjust the rotor position.|$|E
6000|$|Then I cried: [...] "A-hoi!" [...] as Thorgrimmer my {{ancestor}} {{may have}} done when he wielded this same sword, and while Deleroy still staggered beneath my thrust I grasped Wave-Flame with both <b>hands,</b> <b>wheeled</b> it aloft, and smote. He lifted his arm round which he had wound his cloak, to protect his head, but the sword shore through cloak and arm, so that his hand with the glittering rings upon it fell to the floor.|$|R

50|$|With the Hand Unit most {{important}} recording {{features of the}} camera can be remote controlled: START/STOP, frame rate adjustment, frame rate ramp settings, frame rate jumps. The ergonomic design allows comfortable one hand use to start and stop recording. With the well fitted <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> the frame rate can be changed smoothly while recording.|$|E
50|$|The cap was winded by a <b>hand</b> <b>wheel</b> of 8 ft {{diameter}} housed {{just inside}} {{the rear of the}} cap. The worm wheel that engaged with the cogs set into the top of the tower was latterly a cast-iron one, replacing an earlier wooden one.
