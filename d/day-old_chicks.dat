40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 800 {{incubating}} eggs {{produced by a}} commercial flock of Cobb broiler breeders {{was used to determine}} the effects of storage duration (3 or 18 d) on spread of hatch and chick quality. Chick relative growth (RG) at the end of 7 d of rearing was also determined as a measure of the chick performance. Chick quality was defined to encompass several qualitative characteristics and scored according to their importance. Eggs stored for 3 d hatched earlier than those stored for 18 d (P < 0. 05). Hatching was normally distributed in both categories of eggs, and the spread of hatch was not affected by storage time (P = 0. 69). Storage duration of 18 d reduced the percentage of <b>day-old</b> <b>chick</b> with high quality as well as average chick quality score (P < 0. 05). RG varied with length of egg storage, quality of <b>day-old</b> <b>chick,</b> and the incubation duration (P < 0. 05). Eighteen-day storage of eggs not only resulted in longer incubation duration and lower quality score but also depressed RG. Chick quality as defined in this study was correlated to RG and storage time. It was concluded that <b>day-old</b> <b>chick</b> quality may be a relatively good indicator of broiler performance. The results suggest however that in order to improve performance prediction power of chick quality, it would be better to define it as a combination of several qualitative aspects of the <b>day-old</b> <b>chick</b> and the juvenile growth to 7 d. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Although {{artificial}} feeding {{models for the}} poultry red mite (Dermanyssus gallinae) most frequently use biological membranes consisting of <b>day-old</b> <b>chick</b> skin, there are ethical considerations {{associated with the use}} of skin. The few studies reported in the literature that have investigated the use of synthetic membranes to feed D. gallinae in vitro have reported limited success. The current study describes an investigation into the use of synthetic membranes made from either Nescofilm® or rayon and silicone, used either alone or in combination with different feather or skin extracts, as well as the use of capillary tubes. In all, 12 different treatments were used, and the feeding rate of D. gallinae was compared to that of <b>day-old</b> <b>chick</b> skin. Allowing mites to feed on a membrane consisting of Nescofilm with a skin extract resulted in the highest proportion of mites feeding (32. 3 %), which was not significantly different to the feeding rate of mites on <b>day-old</b> <b>chick</b> skin (38. 8 %). This study confirms that synthetic membranes can be used to feed D. gallinae artificially. Further optimization of the membrane and mite storage conditions is still necessary, but the study demonstrates a proof of concept...|$|R

This ethical framework was used to develop an online survey administered to ascertain Dutch public opinion about these alternative approaches. The results show that neither alternative will be fully accepted, or accepted by more than half of Dutch society.

40|$|ANUMBER of {{investigations}} {{have been made}} of the relationship between egg size, day-old weight, and rate of growth of chickens. Halbersleben and Mussehl (1922) found that <b>day-old</b> <b>chick</b> weight varied directly with egg weight but that after 35 days the chicks from the smaller eggs averaged approximately the same weight as the chicks that were hatched from larger eggs. Jull and Quinn (1925) found that the weight of the chick seems to be determined more or less by the weight of the egg from which it is hatched. Upp (1928) found a positive correlation of. 8283 ±. 0055 between egg weight and <b>day-old</b> <b>chick</b> weight. Rate of growth was found to be independent of the chick size at the time of hatching. Turkeys are grown primarily for flesh. The egg is merely a means of propagation and is little used as food, whereas, the chicken egg is of primary importance, and in the trade channels must meet certain size specifications. In the chick hatching indus-try certain weight standards are applied to * Contribution No. 98 from the Department of Poultry Husbandry. the eggs that are incubated and similar standards have been proposed for the turkey egg. Among growers of turkeys it is a com-mon belief that small egg size is associated with small adult weight. If, however, there is no correlation between the weight of the turkey egg and subsequent adult weight, there appears to be little justification for not setting the smaller turkey eggs. There is some evidence that the adult weight of the turkey is not conditioned by egg size. Work at the Purdue Agricultural Experiment Station (1933) indicated that yearling turkey hens laid larger eggs than pullets, and the poults hatched from the eggs laid by the yearling hens were larger than the day-old pullet progeny. However, at 16 weeks of age the average weights of the progeny of the pullets approximately equaled the weight of the progeny of the hens. Similar results have been reported b...|$|R
