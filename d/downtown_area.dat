5|$|Flagstaff {{grew and}} prospered through the 1960s. During the 1970s and 1980s, however, many {{businesses}} {{started to move}} from the city center, and the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> entered an economic and social decline. Sears and J.C. Penney left the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> in 1979 to open up as anchor stores in the new Flagstaff Mall, joined in 1986 by Dillard's. By 1987, the Babbitt Brothers Trading Company, which had been a retail fixture in Flagstaff since 1891, had closed its doors at Aspen Avenue and San Francisco Street.|$|E
5|$|The Youngstown Historical Center of Industry and Labor sits {{south of}} the YSU campus on a grade {{overlooking}} the <b>downtown</b> <b>area.</b> This museum, {{owned and operated by}} the Ohio Historical Society, focuses on the Mahoning Valley's history of steel production. Other museums include the Children's Museum of the Valley, an interactive educational center in the <b>downtown</b> <b>area,</b> and the Davis Education and Recreation Center, a small museum that showcases the history of Youngstown's Mill Creek Park.|$|E

5|$|Travel between Haifa and {{the center}} of the country is {{possible}} by road with Highway 2, the main highway along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, Highway 4 runs along the coast to the north of Haifa, as well as south, inland from Highway 2. In the past, traffic along Highway 2 to the north of Haifa had to pass through the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> of the city; the Carmel Tunnels, opened for traffic 1 December 2010, now route this traffic under Mount Carmel, reducing congestion in the <b>downtown</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additionally, the {{population}} of Downtown Miami nearly doubled from 2000 to 2010, {{and is expected to}} increase by several thousand more in the current decade, largely due to many new high rise condo developments in the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> adding thousands of housing units which will benefit from having the tunnel. Although traffic and port activity has declined since the early 90's, losing some of it to the nearby Port Everglades, which overtook Port of Miami in 2007 as Florida's largest cargo port, the port is likely to see a large shift in the other direction after it becomes one of few deep water ports in the United States able to handle the New Panamax ships by 2016. Within the first month of opening, it was reported that congestion in the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> had eased.|$|E
5|$|As {{the freeway}} passes from the Rocky Mountains to the Great Plains, I-70 enters the Denver {{metropolitan}} area, {{part of a}} larger urban area called the Front Range Urban Corridor. The freeway arcs around the northern edge of the LoDo district, the common name of the lower <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> of Denver. Through the <b>downtown</b> <b>area,</b> US40 is routed along Colfax Avenue, which served as the primary east–west artery through the Denver area before the construction of I-70. Through downtown, US6 is routed along 6th Avenue before departing the I-70 corridor to join Interstate76 on a northeast course toward Nebraska. The freeway meets Interstate25 in an interchange frequently called the Mousetrap. From I-25 on to I-225, I-70 serves—together with those two Interstates—as part of an inner beltway around Denver.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, Federal Street, a major {{downtown}} thoroughfare {{that was}} closed off {{to create a}} pedestrian-oriented plaza, was reopened to through traffic. The <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> has seen the razing of structurally unsound buildings and the expansion or restoration of others.|$|E

5|$|Interstate 40, the city's major east–west {{thoroughfare}} {{was completed}} entirely through Amarillo in November 1968 across {{the center of}} the city. Previously, U.S. Highway 66 was the major east–west highway through the city, generally following Amarillo Blvd. {{to the north of the}} <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> and then curving southwest to leave the city near the Veterans Hospital. A city route (which was an original alignment of US 66 through central and west Amarillo) followed Fillmore south into the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> and turned on West 6th through the San Jacinto Heights district which is now home to many antique shops, restaurants and other businesses, passing the Amarillo Country Club and veering onto West 9th Street and Bushland Blvd. before tying into the through route at a traffic circle near the Veterans Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Interstate 496 (I-496) is an {{auxiliary}} Interstate Highway that passes through downtown Lansing in the US state of Michigan. Also {{a component of}} the State Trunkline Highway System, the freeway connects I-96 to the <b>downtown</b> <b>area.</b> It has been named the R.E. Olds Freeway (sometimes just Olds Freeway) for Ransom E. Olds, the founder of Oldsmobile and the REO Motor Car Company. I-496 runs east–west from I-96/I-69 near the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> and north–south along a section that runs concurrently with US Highway127 (US127). The trunkline also passes a former assembly plant used by Oldsmobile and runs along or crosses parts of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers.|$|E

5|$|The loop {{was created}} in 1974 when I-196 was {{completed}} {{south of the city}} of Holland. From that point, the old route of M-21 inside the cities to US31 was redesignated as a business loop of I-196 with the state taking control of Washington Avenue to the <b>downtown</b> <b>area.</b> Then from downtown looping back up to Chicago Drive, the business loop used the old M-21. Along Washington Avenue and Chicago Drive between junctions with US31, the highway bore a concurrent Bus. US31 designation. The concurrent trunkline inside the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> of Holland was transferred to the City of Holland in 2005, and BL I-196 was rerouted to follow US31. In 2016, the section of the business loop that runs concurrently with US31 was designated as part of the West Michigan Pike Pure Michigan Byway.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{may seem}} rare in {{downtown}} areas because downtown areas cover {{such a small}} geographical area. Considering {{the size of a}} central business district is very small compared to the city limits, tornadoes will strike outside of the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> more often.|$|E
5|$|A {{completely}} new station was also {{added to the}} line for traffic mitigation {{as part of the}} reconstruction of the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge. On June 7, 2002, State Street Station was opened in New Haven to provide better access to the <b>downtown</b> <b>area</b> than Union Station, which is half a mile away from the business district.|$|E

5|$|A freeway {{along the}} I-475 {{corridor}} was {{proposed in the}} 1950s.

5|$|Business US Highway31 (Bus.

US12 {{at the corner of}} Front and Main streets. At the time it was decommissioned, Bus. US31 was only designated along the north–south segment between Walton Road and Main Street.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} in urban freeways.

25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s the {{problems}} with urban sprawl were becoming evident in the United States. When cities improved roads and the transit times were lowered, suburbs developed at ever increasing distances from the city cores, and people {{moved out of the}} <b>downtown</b> <b>areas.</b> Lacking pollution control systems, the rapid rise in car ownership and the longer trips to and from work were causing significant air quality problems. Additionally, movement to the suburbs led to a flight of capital from the <b>downtown</b> <b>areas,</b> one cause of the rapid urban decay seen in the US.|$|R
