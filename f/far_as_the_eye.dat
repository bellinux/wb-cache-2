25|$|As part of {{the peace}} between England and France, Pope Sixtus IV issued in 1483 a Papal bull {{granting}} the Privilege of Neutrality, by which the Islands, their harbours and seas, as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> can see, were considered neutral territory. Anyone molesting Islanders would be excommunicated. A Royal Charter in 1548 confirmed the neutrality. Not that the French behaved, as they attempted to invade Jersey a year later in 1549 but were defeated by the militia. The neutrality lasted another century, until William III of England abolished the privilege due to privateering activity against Dutch ships.|$|E

In 1985, it was reported that the inscription of the tombstone had been whited out with plaster by members of Tan's own family who wished to obscure any glorification of Chay Wa's [...] "martyrdom" [...] in the communist cause. At that time, all that could be seen clearly was a photograph of Chay Wa and some lettering showing his name and the years of his birth and death.|$|E

[...] Spielberg included footage of Iniki battering the Kaua'i coastal walls as part of the completed film, where a tropical storm makes up a pivotal part of the plot. Members of the film's crew helped to clear some of the debris off of nearby roads.|$|E

These areas are characterized by expansive lowlands that stretch <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> can see and are ideal for sugar planting because of the city's naturally fertile soil. It is no wonder why 73% of the city's total land area is devoted primarily to agriculture.|$|R

It consists of fibrous bone, vertically directed, which might have formed the base for a much higher crest of soft tissue. The crest starts above the twelfth tooth position; its limit at the back is unknown because of damage but it is considered unlikely that it extended <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes,</b> <b>the</b> roof of the skull not showing any trace of it.

After the battle had ended, Dayan visited the area of the battlefield. Reshef, who accompanied him, said, [...] "Look at this valley of death." [...] The minister, taken aback by the great destruction before him, muttered in an undertone, [...] "What you people have done here!" [...] Later, Dayan would recount that: [...] "I am no novice at war or battle scenes, but I have never seen such a sight, not in reality, or in paintings, or in the worst war movies. Here was a vast field of slaughter stretching as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> could see." [...] Sharon would also provide his own poignant account of the aftermath: [...] "It was as if a hand-to-hand battle of armor had taken place... Coming close you could see the Egyptian and Jewish dead lying side-by-side, soldiers who had jumped from their burning tanks and died together. No picture could capture the horror of the scene, none could encompass what had happened there." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cuppy's best-known work, a satire {{on history}} called The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody, was {{unfinished}} when he died.

The square and the streets seemed freshly raked. To the left towards the watchtower, I saw a white wooden barrack and beside it a large cage, the size of a birdhouse the like you see at a zoo. Within it paraded peacocks (stolzierten) and on a climbing tree dangled monkeys and a parrot which always screamed the same word, [...] "Mama".

[...] When the area was finally ceded to the U.S. in 1848, these horses and others in the surrounding areas were rounded up and trailed north and east, resulting in the near elimination of mustangs in that area by 1860.|$|E

6000|$|... § 10. It is {{this last}} change only {{which is to}} be the subject of our present inquiry; but it cannot be doubted that it is closely {{connected}} with all the others, and that we can only thoroughly understand its nature by considering it in this connection. For, regarded by itself, we might, perhaps, too rashly assume it to be a natural consequence of the progress of the race. There appears to be a diminution of selfishness in it, and a more extended and heartfelt desire of understanding the manner of God's working; and this the more, because one of the permanent characters of this change is a greater accuracy in the statement of external facts. When <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of men were fixed first upon themselves, and upon nature solely and secondarily as bearing upon their interests, it was of less consequence to them what the ultimate laws of nature were, than what their immediate effects were upon human beings. Hence they could rest satisfied with phenomena instead of principles, and accepted without scrutiny every fable which seemed sufficiently or gracefully to account for those phenomena. But so <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>eyes</b> of men are now withdrawn from themselves, and turned upon the inanimate things about them, the results cease to be of importance, and the laws become essential.|$|R
