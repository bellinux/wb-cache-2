5|$|Universal Pictures spent $2.1million {{to market}} the film in a 30-second {{television}} spot during Super Bowl XXXVII on January 26, 2003. And a 70-second teaser trailer was attached to Spider-Man on May 3, 2002. Just weeks before the film's release, a number of workprints were leaked on the Internet. The visual and special effects were already being criticized, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not the final editing cut of the film.|$|E
5|$|After the Cournoyer goal, {{the goal}} judge refused {{to put the}} goal light on <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was signalled a goal on the ice. In response, Alan Eagleson (seated across the ice from the Team Canada bench) {{attempted}} to reach the timer's bench to protest, causing a ruckus in the crowd {{as he made his}} way to the timer's bench. As he was being subdued by the Soviet police, the Canadian players headed over and Peter Mahovlich jumped over the boards to confront police with his stick. Eagleson was freed and the coaches escorted him across the ice to the bench. In anger, he shoved his fist to the Soviet crowd, as a few other Canadian supporters also gave the finger to the Soviets. The Soviets continued to play defensively. Sinden speculates the Soviets were willing to accept the tie and win the series on goal differential.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1943, {{he headed}} up a {{committee}} of USAAF and RAF commanders {{to draw up a}} plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO). <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> altered the target system priorities outlined in AWPD-42, and changed the overall goal of the offensive from knocking Germany out of the war using airpower to one of preparing for the invasion of Europe, Hansell approved the designation of the German aircraft industry as its most important target and the destruction of the German Luftwaffe as its top priority. Hansell wrote the final draft of the CBO plan himself. Although Hansell did not personally participate in later strategic bombing operations against Germany, he had been instrumental in setting in motion the plans and policies that led to the near total destruction of German war industry.|$|E
50|$|It {{is noted}} {{that there are a}} number of errors in the making of <b>the</b> film. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> New Orleans is {{actually}} below sea level, the movie shows sinkholes in a cavern extending more than 60 ft underground, and bone dry, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> virtually any digging underground in the real New Orleans would result in flooded ground.|$|R

5|$|During {{his tenure}} as a civil engineer, Lemoine wrote a {{treatise}} concerning compass and straightedge constructions entitled, La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which he considered his greatest work, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not well-received critically. The original title was De la mesure de la simplicité dans les sciences mathématiques, and the original idea for the text would have discussed the concepts Lemoine devised as concerning the entirety of mathematics. Time constraints, however, limited {{the scope of the}} paper. Instead of the original idea, Lemoine proposed a simplification of the construction process to a number of basic operations with the compass and straightedge. He presented this paper {{at a meeting of the}} Association Française in Oran, Algeria in 1888. The paper, however, did not garner much enthusiasm or interest among the mathematicians gathered there. Lemoine published several other papers on his construction system that same year, including Sur la mesure de la simplicité dans les constructions géométriques in the Comptes rendus of the Académie française. He published additional papers on the subject in Mathesis (1888), Journal des mathématiques élémentaires (1889), Nouvelles annales de mathématiques (1892), and the self-published La Géométrographie ou l'art des constructions géométriques, which was presented at the meeting of the Association Française in Pau (1892), and again at Besançon (1893) and Caen (1894).|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} StarCraft is {{presented}} through its instruction manual, the briefings to each mission and conversations within the missions themselves, {{along with the}} use of cinematic cutscenes at key points. The game itself is split into three episodes, one for the player to command each race. In the first segment of the game, the player and Jim Raynor are attempting to control the colony of Mar Sara {{in the wake of the}} Zerg attacks on other Terran worlds. After the Confederacy arrests Raynor for destroying Confederate property, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had been infested by the Zerg, the player joins Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal. Raynor, who is freed by Mengsk's troops, also joins and frequently accompanies the player on missions. Mengsk then begins to use Confederate technology captured on Mar Sara to lure the Zerg to Confederate installations and further his own goals. After forcing Confederate general Edmund Duke to join him, Mengsk sacrifices his own second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to ensure the destruction of the Confederacy by luring the Zerg to the Confederate capital Tarsonis. Raynor is outraged by Mengsk's true aims of obtaining power at any cost and deserts, taking with him a small army of the former colonial militia of Mar Sara. Mengsk reorganizes what remains of the Terran population into the Terran Dominion, crowning himself as emperor.|$|E
25|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{had only}} four episodes, {{it remains a}} cult show to this day with many of its skits {{regarded}} as timeless Israeli classics. Lool showcased Einstein as both a top-of-the-line singer and comedian.|$|E

The university subsequently admitted that its admissions policy was in fact need-aware.|$|E
25|$|Lisa Turtle was {{originally}} {{conceived as a}} rich Jewish princess from Long Island, spoiled, materialistic, and obsessed with shopping. While still casting from the role, African-American actress Lark Voorhies was brought into Engel's office, and he immediately knew she was perfect for the role <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> meant rewriting the character.|$|E
25|$|The third principle, tradition, affects {{for example}} surnames, whose {{spelling}} often predates the modern spelling rules of Hungarian. For example, kovács ’smith’ may be spelt Kovács, Kováts or Kovách as a surname. Another example for tradition {{is that the}} digraph ly is still used <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> stands for the same sound as j in today's standard Hungarian.|$|E

Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje turned down an offer to return because of salary disagreements. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was earlier reported by Carlton Cuse that Malcolm David Kelley would appear, he only appeared in archive footage.|$|E
25|$|In the Middle East, Bush began a new {{approach}} to the peace process, the so-called Annapolis process, which attempts to encourage Israeli and Palestinian leaders to agree on the outlines of a peace accord. Although both sides cite some success in these discussions, critics believe the talks have unduly ignored Hamas, which has been labeled as a terrorist organization, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> holds an enormous amount of political power in the region.|$|E
25|$|Farrell {{was elected}} to a one-year term as the honorary mayor of North Hollywood in 1937, beating her {{competition}} Bing Crosby and Lewis Stone by a three-to-one margin. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> began as a Warner Bros. publicity stunt, Farrell took the job very seriously, attending functions, presentations, and ceremonies. She was also put in charge when the North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced that it wanted to put sewers along Ventura Highway and started the groundwork for that project.|$|E

25|$|The National Greek War Relief Association, an {{organization}} formed in October 1940 by the Greek Orthodox Church, started {{to raise funds}} in the United States and to organize relief efforts to supply the population with food and medicine. The British were initially reluctant to lift the blockade since {{it was the only}} form of pressure they had on the Axis Powers. However, a compromise was reached to allow shipments of grain to come from the neutral Turkey, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was within the blockade zone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{could be}} {{considered}} against the interest of himself and his class, he campaigned long and hard for repeal of the Corn Laws. The great majority of his contributions in parliament were on this subject. He continued to campaign even after he left parliament. His successor in the Wolverhampton seat was Charles Pelham Villiers, another radical Whig who continued his anti-Corn Law work. The repeal was not achieved until 1846, when the Tory leader, Robert Peel, split his party to force the measure through with Whig support.|$|E

The United Nations Security Council recognized Mongolia's nuclear-weapon-free status on 17 September 2012 <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> cannot join one of the World's Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zones, in part, because of the country's close proximity to nuclear-armed states Russia and China. Mongolia renounced nuclear materials and {{became a member of}} Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe in 2013 and UN General Assembly's President Vuk Jeremic congratulated Elbegdorj for these.|$|E
25|$|Throughout 1863 {{and part}} of 1864, Montgomery practiced his Jayhawker brand of {{irregular}} warfare in South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. In June 1863, Montgomery's brigade, including the 2nd South Carolina and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry under Col. Robert Gould Shaw, participated in operations along the Atlantic Coast resembling his earlier Jayhawking raids in Kansas and Missouri. The 2nd South Carolina {{was a part of}} the Raid at Combahee Ferry in which 800 slaves were freed.

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Chicago Cubs awarded Sosa's # 21 to new pitcher Jason Marquis, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was {{formerly}} worn by Sosa, who coincidentally later hit his 600th home run against Marquis. Ted Lilly, {{who had also}} signed with the Cubs that prior winter had requested #31 but was told it was not available as {{it was going to}} be retired for Greg Maddux and Fergie Jenkins, and they were just waiting for Maddux to retire. This caused some concern, due to Sosa's accomplishments with the Cubs, including his status as the Cubs' all-time home run leader.|$|E
