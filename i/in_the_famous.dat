5|$|As {{relations}} between England and France worsened, however, a removal to France became impracticable. Following {{the declaration of}} war of February 1793, and the Aliens Bill of March 1793, which forbade correspondence or travel between England and France, William Priestley left France for America. Joseph Priestley's sons Harry and Joseph chose to leave England for America in August 1793. Finally Priestley himself followed with his wife, boarding the Sansom at Gravesend on 7 April 1793. Five weeks after Priestley left, William Pitt's administration began arresting radicals for seditious libel, resulting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> 1794 Treason Trials.|$|E

After spending six seasons with the organization, Collins spent a one-year sojourn {{in the minor leagues}} before he was traded to the New York Yankees, where he spent the next three years and played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> 1927 Murderers' Row lineup. At the conclusion of the 1928 season, he was traded to the Boston Braves, with whom he played his last game on May 23, 1929. A two-time World Series champion, he is famous for being the only major league player to pinch hit and pinch run in the same game.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of the Commonwealth, 1649–60, {{wholesale}} iconoclasm was wrought on all the pictorial elements of Christian buildings. Most of England’s medieval stained glass was smashed. The majority of England’s medieval statues were smashed or defaced leaving only a few isolated examples intact. Medieval paintings almost disappeared. Vestments embroidered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> style known as Opus Anglicanum were burnt. Those medieval Communion vessels that had escaped the Dissolution were melted down so that only about 50 items of pre-Reformation church plate remain.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the demise}} of the Pandya kingdom in the 14th century, Kumbakonam was conquered by the Vijayanagar Empire. Krishnadevaraya (1509–29), the emperor of Vijayanagara visited the town in 1524 and is {{believed}} to have bathed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> Mahamaham tank during the Mahamaham festival. Kumbakonam was ruled by the Madurai Nayaks and the Thanjavur Nayaks from 1535 to 1673 when it fell to the Marathas. Each of these foreign dynasties had a considerable impact on the demographics and culture of the region. When the Vijayanagar Empire fell in 1565, there was a mass influx of poets, musicians and cultural artists from the kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, Ray {{directed}} Kanchenjungha. Based on {{his first}} original screenplay, {{it was his first}} film in colour. The film tells of an upper-class family spending an afternoon in Darjeeling, a picturesque hill town in West Bengal. They try to arrange the engagement of their youngest daughter to a highly paid engineer educated in London. He had first conceived shooting the film in a large mansion, but later decided to film it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> hill town. He used the many shades of light and mist to reflect the tension in the drama. Ray noted that while his script allowed shooting to be possible under any lighting conditions, a commercial film contingent present {{at the same time in}} Darjeeling failed to shoot a single scene, as they only wanted to do so in sunshine.|$|E

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering one piece of film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E
5|$|For the Persians, {{the only}} {{unfinished}} business that remained {{by the end}} of 493 BC was to exact punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius's empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria. The first Persian invasion of Greece thus began in the following year, 492 BC, when Mardonius was dispatched (via Ionia) to complete the pacification of the land approaches to Greece, and push on to Athens and Eretria if possible. Thrace was re-subjugated, having broken loose from Persian rule during the revolts, and Macedon compelled to become a vassal of Persia. However, progress was halted by a naval disaster. A second expedition was launched in 490 BC under Datis and Artaphernes, son of the satrap Artaphernes. This amphibious force sailed across the Aegean, subjugating the Cyclades, before arriving off Euboea. Eretria was besieged, captured and destroyed, and the force then moved onto Attica. Landing at the Bay of Marathon, they were met by an Athenian army, and defeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> Battle of Marathon, ending the first Persian attempt to subdue Greece.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different times or when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E

5|$|If, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> {{garden and}} {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue {{of the two}} lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for the musician {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
5|$|The {{club was}} {{established}} on West 58th Street in 1929 by Sherman Billingsley, a former bootlegger from Enid, Oklahoma. After an incident when Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by Mad Dog Coll, a rival of his mobster partners, {{he became the}} sole owner of the Stork Club. The club remained at its original location until it was raided by Prohibition agents in 1931. After the raid, it moved to East 51st Street. From 1934 until its closure in 1965, it was located at 3 East 53rd Street, just east of Fifth Avenue, when it became world-renowned with its celebrity clientele and luxury. Billingsley {{was known for his}} lavish gifts, which brought a steady stream of celebrities to the club and also insured that those interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>famous</b> would have a reason to visit.|$|E
