40|$|A {{major problem}} in fire {{protection}} is the design of protective installations for single-storey warehouses of more than 6 m (20 ft) in height. The need to make maximum use of available floor area {{has led to the}} introduction of many such high stacked storages with differing degrees of automation and of heights up to 30 m (100 ft). These present a high fire hazard in both their configuration, which assists rapid fire growth, and in the high value of goods stored. This note describes an investigation of the effectiveness of high expansion foam, combined with different types of fire detection e~uipment, in controlling fires developing in a palletized storage of height 7. 3 m (24 ft), consisting of two rows of back-to-back pallets at four levels. The high expansion foam was found to be effective in controlling the fires with the range of fill rates and application times employed. It was found that early application of the foam was necessary to prevent the fire from reaching ceiling level and. that the foam cover might need to be maintained for some hours to ensure complete extinction of the fire.

40|$|AbstractWith the {{development}} of the social economy, more and more high-rise building is built in the city. The fire fighting of the high-rise building {{has become one of the}} most difficult problems in the fire service. The high-rise building fire relies mainly on the indoor fire protection facility. Outbreak of fire, the indoor fire facility can not satisfy the needs for different reasons. At this time we must have the firefighter put out the fire indoors. By investigation and study, the heavy compressed air foam truck has advantages in the high-rise building's fire fighting, and fire services department has devoted major efforts to increase the numbers of this fire truck. It is sure that with upgrading of the fire fighting equipment throughout the country, heavy-duty compressed air <b>fire</b> <b>foam</b> truck can shoulder the responsibility of high-rise building's fire fighting.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades little work has been {{conducted}} on the environmental behaviour and effects of perfluorinated organochemicals (FOCs). These chemicals are commonly used as solvents, surfactants, cosmetics and are applied in <b>fire</b> <b>foam</b> extinguishers. Recent findings have shown that FOCs (with perfluorooctane sulfonic acid - PFOS - {{as the most important}} representative) are detected in organisms living in industrialized as well as in remote areas. The fact that PFOS is hardly biodegradable, clearly accumulates in the liver and blood of top predators and the fact that little information is available on the toxic properties of PFOS, makes this chemical an environmental pollutant of primary concern. In the present study we measured PFOS concentrations in seven marine mammals stranded on the Belgian, French and Dutch North Sea coast between 1994 and 2000. PFOS concentrations were measured in liver and kidney tissue using combined liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Detectable PFOS concentrations (up to 820. 60 ng/g) were found in harbour porpoises, white-beaked, white-sided and striped dolphins, sperm whales and harbour seals. In fin whale and hooded seal concentrations were below the detection limit of 10 ng/g. PFOS levels in female porpoise livers were significant higher than those in males. The present results show clearly the difference in accumulation pattern of PFOS compared to that of persistent organochlorine chemicals. In order to evaluate the interspecies differences, we developed PFOS-trophic level relationships based on stable nitrogen and carbon isotope ratios. Animals that display the highest trophic positions (highest d 15 N) have the highest PFOS levels. The different feeding ecology of these species (inshore versus offshore) also seems to contribute to differences in PFOS concentrations. Next to the presentation of PFOS concentrations in marine mammals of the North Sea, the possible toxicological effects of perfluorinated compounds are discussed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Foams can do {{more than}} soften a beard or {{extinguish}} a <b>fire.</b> <b>Foam</b> also offers the oil industry better mobility control. The presence of a foaming agent in porous rocks can reduce the mobility of gas and water, stabilize the gas injection front and prevent unwanted production of gas and water. These unique properties can assist the reservoir engineer in different optimization processes to enhance oil recovery (EOR) and improve the economics of mature oil fields. A number of factors influence the properties of foam, such as the foaming agent, gas type, rock properties, interactions with oil, injection strategies, and temperature and pressure conditions. A change in one or several of these parameters may affect the performance of the foam and, consequently, the success of the intended foam application. For that reason, {{it is important to understand}} foam on a broad experimental scale. This thesis presents experimental studies of foam in bulk and porous media. The studies in porous media investigated: I) CO 2 -foam properties compared with those of N 2 - foams and II) the impact of rock material on foam generation performance and mobility control. The experiments were performed in oil-free outcrop sandstone core samples in the range of 30 - 280 bar and 50 - 100 °C using alpha-olefin sulfonate (AOSC 14 -C 16) surfactant. The studies in bulk evaluated a set of foaming agents relative to: I) various experimental methods (bulk tests, core flooding), II) different gas types (CO 2, N 2, air) and III) the absence and presence of oils (crude oils, alkanes). A new bulk test was designed in the thesis to allow foams with gases other than air to be studied under low pressure. The combination of several experimental approaches was introduced to improve the evaluation and screening of surfactants. The experimental results obtained in this thesis show that the presence of different gas types (CO 2, N 2) strongly influences the properties of foam in bulk and in porous media. The CO 2 -foams were inherently weaker than the N 2 -foams. Possible reasons for the apparent weakness of the CO 2 -foam compared with the N 2 -foam were investigated more closely. A good correlation between the CO 2 -density and the CO 2 -foam strength was found; conditions where the density of CO 2 is low improved the CO 2 -foam strength. Also, new foam experiments with pre-equilibrated fluids were conducted. These experiments suggested that the kinetics of the mass transfer between CO 2 and the surfactant solution could not be the main cause why the CO 2 -foams were weaker than the N 2 -foams. However, the use of preequilibrated fluids significantly improved the water-blocking capabilities of the CO 2 -foams, indicating that gas dissolution into the injected water is one of the predominant mechanisms that weaken the CO 2 -foams during liquid injection following generation. N 2 -foam experiments in various outcrop sandstone core samples showed that the rock material is one of the main parameters controlling the in-situ foam generation performance. The results demonstrated that foam was able to be generated and reduce mobility in all the sandstone cores used under all the conditions listed above. However, large variations in foam strength and mobility control were obtained between the different core samples. The presence of low permeability laminated heterogeneities, detected through various types of core analysis, appeared to be one of the parameters affecting the foam generation performance. The detailed interactions between the rock surface properties and the thin liquid films were beyond the scope of this thesis, but are suggested to be of central importance to in-situ foam generation performance. The combination of several experimental techniques, including the new bulk test, was shown to be valuable for improving the evaluation and screening of foamers in the absence and presence of oil. Although certain similarities and interesting trends were observed between the experiments in bulk and porous media, the bulk foam properties of this work did not generally correlate with the foam properties in porous media. It seems difficult to predict foam properties and performance separate from the porous media by means of simpler experimental methods. It is hoped that the laboratory-derived results presented in this dissertation will contribute to generate new insights and ideas within the field of foam, provide valuable input to reservoir models and simulations, and suggest practical considerations towards the scaling of foam processes for different EOR applications. </p...|$|E
