30|$|This study {{investigated}} the applicability of NIR spectroscopy to predict the oven-dry density of air-dried Sugi boards and to calibrate a hand-held and an <b>in-line</b> moisture <b>meters</b> for measuring the MC of the boards. Our {{results showed that the}} NIR prediction model for the oven-dry density was robust and applicable to populations in different regions. Performance of moisture meters could be improved by calibration with NIR-predicted density. Furthermore, the <b>in-line</b> moisture <b>meter</b> calibrated by NIR-predicted density reasonably fulfilled the performance requirement of <b>in-line</b> moisture <b>meter</b> for softwood lumber. However, it is uncertain that the density calibration using NIR spectroscopy is applicable to commercial-size lumbers that often contain knots. Nonetheless, the newly developed method to non-destructively calibrate commercial meters will allow us to measure the MC of air-dried Sugi lumber with varying densities more accurately than the conventional density calibration with constant values representing each species.|$|R

While this dilemma seems insurmountable on many dairies, careful analysis of the on-farm milking process can often find the “extra ” time needed to ensure production of high quality milk from high producing individuals without unnecessarily slowing cow throughput. One tool that has helped find this extra time without sacrificing good parlor performance has been the information and reports obtained from <b>in-line</b> milk <b>meters</b> and management software.

40|$|In {{compliance}} with European Regulation and with particular reference to EN 14081, grade assignment of timber {{is based upon}} observation of three properties: strength, stiffness and density. Timber is hereby segregated into different grades. However, characteristic values are statistical properties: strength and density are described by 5 % percentile values and stiffness by the mean value. In other words, even though every piece is assigned to a single grade, the properties can only be determined for the overall population of observations and not for every single piece of timber. ViSCAN, with it’s built in laser interferometer, measures the frequency of vibration. X-ray scanning is used to compute density on cross (DENSCAN) and longitudinal (GoldenEye) transport.

All computers tested in this investigation were installed before the application of this condition, which was October 1, 1995. However, many problems exist other than those remedied by this requirement, including: computers which disengage from the network environment upon entering the lowest power management levels, various software incompatibilities, problematic methods of achieving power reduction, and little to no training of users or even prior negative experiences with power managed equipment There is a need for manufacturers to develop suitable or standard methods of achieving power management In addition, computer procurement employees or users must be taught about power management methods, and must have an opportunity to voice questions or concerns to manufacturers regarding power managed equipment. More research needs to be focused on network incompatibilities. Specifically, many computers are disconnected from their network upon engaging the lowest power level. This is due to either unacceptable power management methods or "stand-alone" power manageable computers which are placed on a network. Users purchasing computers intended for network use should be informed about whether the energy saving features are compatible with their type of network. This thesis is divided into two parts, the first for PCs and the second for workstations. The primary metering site for workstations was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which contains both Energy Star compliant and non-compliant machines. Opportunities for energy conservation in workstations are compared and contrasted to those of desktop PCs and monitors. In addition, current and future trends in workstation manufacturing and their impacts on energy conservation are explored. by Kristie L. Bosko. Thesis (M. S.)

Only fragmentary information was published on the flow close to the mixer exit. In particular, no data for the transitional flow range is available. The presented study aims at shedding more light on the liquid flow instabilities occurring inside a static mixer. Such an experimental evidence should enhance both our fundamental knowledge of the mixing mechanism and would also provide a basis for validation of momentum transfer simulations by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. The measurements were carried out for an SMX static mixer using a 1 D laser Doppler velocimeter with the IFA 750 signal processor delivered by TSI Inc.

First, meter readings were taken from the middle of the boards by setting the density value to the mean measured density of 355  kg/m 3. Second, meter readings were taken again by setting the density value to the NIR-predicted value obtained from the end surface of each board. Thereafter, the boards were oven-dried and their MC was calculated gravimetrically. Twelve boards had oven-dry MC above 30  % and were considered as “wet”. Therefore, the wet boards were eliminated and the remaining 108 boards were used for MC evaluation.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MTech (Electrical Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2007 The {{rheological}} behaviour of non-Newtonian, highly concentrated and non-transparent fluids {{used in industry}} have so far been analysed using commercially available instruments, such as conventional rotational rheometers and tube viscometers. When dealing with the prediction of non-Newtonian flows in pipes, pipe fittings and open channels, most of the models used are empirical in nature. The fact that the fluids or slurries that are used normally are opaque, effectively narrows down the variety of applicable in-line rheometers even further, as these instruments are normally based on laser or visible light techniques, such as Laser Doppler Anemometry. Electrical Resistance Tomography is a non-invasive method used to look into opaque suspensions during pipe flow, but cannot be used to measure in-line rheometry. In this research, an Ultrasound Pulsed Echo Doppler Velocity Profile technique (UVP), in combination with a pressure difference (PD) was tested to provide in-line measurement of rheological parameters. The main objective ofthis research was to evaluate {{the capabilities of the}} UVP-PD technique for rheological characterisation of different concentrations of non-transparent non-Newtonian slurries. A unique pipe viscometer was designed and constructed. It consisted of four pipes, one of stainless steel and three of PVC, linked to an <b>in-line</b> mass-flow <b>meter</b> and equipped with two different ranges of pressure transducers on each pipe. The stainless steel pipe, with an inner diameter of 16 mm, was equipped with a specially designed flow adapter for in-line rheological characterisation using the UVP-PD method.

40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is a {{pollutant}} (greenhouse gas) that is emitted during winemaking but {{not currently}} {{regulated by the}} Environmental Protection Agency. While winery CO 2 emissions have been modeled, {{they have never been}} measured continuously or confirmed during a commercial fermentation.

The study was designed to quantify emissions and test a theoretical model for atmospheric release of CO 2 during alcoholic fermentation in a commercial winery. Gas release was channeled through a manifold system with an <b>in-line</b> mass flow <b>meter</b> calibrated for CO 2, providing real-time and integrated measurement of atmospheric emission. Intermittent use of a hot-wire anemometer was used as a check on the mass-flow measurements.

However, the time course of release and the shape of the release curves differed substantially among ferments and were primarily dependent on the length of active fermentation...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} mentioned problems in relation to processing beetle-killed wood in the British Columbia Interior is that of kiln drying charges consisting of both green and partly dried stock. This results from the fact that dead beetle-killed stems are currently harvested and processed along with green stems from the same stands. The losses, or additional costs, associated with the current procedures include the following: 1. extra cost to kiln dry already dry wood, 2. excessive degrade in the already dry stock, and 3. increased planer breakage due to overdry wood, and related planer production delays. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine some possible alternatives available for dealing with this problem, the equip-ment changes required, the advantages and disadvantages of the alternatives and some related considerations. This is done within the framework of a series of studies designed to evaluate the economic merits of the alternatives. PROPOSAL In order to reduce the losses referred to above, it is proposed that the dry beetle-killed wood and green normal wood be segregated and the lumber dried separately. MILL TYPE The type of operation examined in the following alternatives is a typical British Columbian Interior spruce-pine-fir (S-P-F) dimension mill producing 2 x 4 to 2 x 10 in lengths from 8 to 20 feet, requiring 28 basic length and width sorts. SORTING ALTERNATIVES Four basic alternatives for sorting have been identified: 1. No change (control) : continue to run mixed dry and green stock throughout the operation; 2. Sort in woods: segregate dead (red top or older) from live stems as early as possible during harvesting. Haul them separately to the mill and store them separately in the yard; 3. Double the sorts: this alternative requires doubling the number of sorts in a typical bin sorter, and adding an <b>in-line</b> moisture <b>meter</b> to identify and separate the dry from the green pieces...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to compare the ability of chlorhexidine and povidone-iodine to cause cessation of lactation in Staphylococcus aureus-infected mammary quarters, assess milk production in the treated quarter in the subsequent lactation, and evalu-ate whether microbiological cure was obtained. Four-teen mid- to late-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cat-tle from the Washington State University dairy herd with single mammary quarter S. aureus intramam-mary infections were studied. Cows were randomly as-signed to one of two treatment groups, povidone-iodine or chlorhexidine. Cows in the povidone-iodine group were infused with 120 ml of 5 % povidone-iodine solution (0. 5 % iodine) after complete milk-out. Chlorhexidine-treated cows were infused with a proprietary chlorhexi-dine suspension after two milkings 24 h apart. Treated mammary quarters were not milked for the rest of the lactation. Milk production from each mammary quarter (kg of milk/quarter) was measured using <b>in-line</b> volume flow <b>meters</b> for 5 consecutive days before treatment and again at the start of the subsequent lactation. Povidone-iodine caused permanent cessation of lactation in the treated quarter, whereas 71 % of the chlorhexidine-treated mammary quarters returned to function in the subsequent lactation. Hence, if the primary objective is to eliminate the mammary quarter from lactation, and thereby presumably lower the risk of herdmates acquiring new S. aureus intramammary infection, then povidone-iodine appears to be the best of the two meth-ods. No difference in total milk production between lac-tation one and two in either group was found, sug-gesting that permanent loss of a quarter was not detri-mental to overall milk production...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of diesel}} engine has been {{increasing}} in agricultural and industrial applications. The unfavorable diesel smoke, however, discourage the wide-spread use due to health hazards. The smoke also limits the maximum power output. Reduction of diesel smoke by adaptive control was {{the ultimate goal of}} this research. The objective {{of this study was to}} find an empirical model of diesel engine transfer function for control purpose. With an assumption of linear diesel operation in a limited region, the linear theory was adopted. Since a smoke problem generally appears during unsteady operation, fuel metering rate was selected as an input variable. Binary input signals (pseudo-random binary sequence and multi-frequency binary sequence) were selected as input signals. Step input signal was also used for transient study of smoke production. The system identification method using binary signals was tested by computer simulation before applying it to the engine experiment;An engine control and monitoring package was developed using an 8088 based personal computer. This package included a host computer, a multipurpose interface board for signal processing, a fuel metering valve perturbing mechanism with a modified fuel <b>metering</b> pump, an <b>in-line</b> smoke opacity <b>meter,</b> and an operating software written in C and Assembly languages. Temperatures at various engine locations and air/fuel flow were also measured. The spectral analysis was implemented to find the frequency response of system for the pseudo-random binary signal. The multi-frequency binary input and the output signals were Fourier transformed. The resulting frequency domain signals were plotted on Bode plot and postulated transfer functions were fitted using the Box nonlinear optimization procedure;The higher order of transfer function between smoke opacity and fuel metering rate was obtained for 9 operating points. These models can be utilized in development of an electronic injection pump for the reducing smoke level and increasing fuel economy. With sufficiently fast computation, on-line identification might be possible and adaptive control of fuel metering could be implemented. Adaptive control with on-line identification and appropriate sensors leads to an integrated engine management system...|$|R
40|$|The {{accurate}} {{measurement of}} multiphase flows of oil/water/gas {{is a critical}} element of oil exploration and production. Thus, {{over the last three}} decades; the development and deployment of <b>in-line</b> multiphase flow <b>metering</b> systems has been a major focus worldwide. Accurate measurement of multiphase flow in {{the oil and gas industry}} is difficult because there is a wide range of flow regimes and multiphase meters do not generally perform well under the intermittent slug flow conditions which commonly occur in oil production. This thesis investigates the use of Doppler and cross-correlation ultrasonic measurements made in different high gas void fraction flow, partially separated liquid and gas flows, and homogeneous flow and raw slug flow, to assess the accuracy of measurement in these regimes. This approach has been tested on water/air flows in a 50 mm diameter pipe facility. The system employs a partial gas/liquid separation and homogenisation using a T-Y junction configuration. A combination of ultrasonic measurement techniques was used to measure flow velocities and conductivity rings to measure the gas fraction. In the partially separated regime, ultrasonic cross-correlation and conductivity rings are used to measure the liquid flow-rate. In the homogeneous flow, a clamp-on ultrasonic Doppler meter is used to measure the homogeneous velocity and combined with conductivity ring measurements to provide measurement of the liquid and gas flow-rates. The slug flow regime measurements employ the raw Doppler shift data from the ultrasonic Doppler flowmeter, together with the slug flow closure equation and combined with gas fraction obtained by conductivity rings, to determine the liquid and gas flow-rates. Measurements were made with liquid velocities from 1. 0 m/s to 2. 0 m/s with gas void fractions up to 60 %. Using these techniques the accuracies of the liquid flow-rate measurement in the partially separated, homogeneous and slug regimes were 10 %, 10 % and 15 % respectively. The accuracy of the gas flow-rate in both the homogeneous and raw slug regimes was 10 %. The method offers the possibility of further improvement in the accuracy by combining measurement from different regimes...|$|R
