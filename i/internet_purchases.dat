Personal services such as health care, legal services, financial services, and auto repairs would be subject to the FairTax, as would renting apartments and other real property. [...] Food, clothing, prescription drugs and medical services would be taxed. (State sales taxes generally exempt these types of basic-need items in an effort to reduce the tax burden on low-income families. The FairTax would use a monthly rebate system instead of the common state exclusions.) <b>Internet</b> <b>purchases</b> would be taxed, as would retail international purchases (such as a boat or car) that are imported to the United States (collected by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection).|$|E

The face-to-face encounter scenario is modified to account for the asynchronous and non-contiguous nature of an <b>internet</b> <b>purchase,</b> thus providing theorists and practitioners with a new model for evaluation of the process that a customer goes through when <b>purchasing</b> on the <b>internet...</b>|$|R

The sample allows us to explore the influence of price and income related variables as well as personal characteristics on <b>internet</b> <b>purchased</b> goods.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to extend the {{traditional}} theoretical model of service recovery to the online purchasing environment by investigating the impact of perceptions of justice after recovery efforts toward unsatisfactory <b>Internet</b> <b>purchasing</b> on customer trust and loyalty. The authors develop a theoretical model focusing on interrelationships among complaint handling evaluations, quality of prior experience, familiarity, trust, perceived value and loyalty. To test this model, 3, 339 customers from all over Brazil who had been engaged in complaint processes about online purchases within the past 6 months answered an online questionnaire. Findings indicate that interpersonal treatment by the e-retailer improves consumer perceptions of the online recovery process. Consumer trust in the firm's website is strongly influenced by satisfaction with complaint handling, familiarity and the quality of prior experiences with the website, while consumer trust in Internet shopping is mainly affected by familiarity and the quality of prior experiences with <b>Internet</b> <b>purchasing.</b> These two dimensions of trust are distinct and represent discrete facets, as they do not impact each other. Moreover, repurchase intentions and word-of-mouth communication are influenced by consumer trust...|$|R
