5|$|The European Council, {{charged with}} {{defining}} the European Union's (EU) overall political direction and priorities, is {{the institution of}} the EU that comprises the heads of state or government of the member states, along with the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy also takes part in its meetings. Established as an informal summit in 1975, the European Council was formalised as an institution in 2009 upon the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> of the Treaty of Lisbon. Its current President is Donald Tusk.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the Council is to act as one of the two {{chambers}} of the EU's legislative branch, the other chamber being the European Parliament. It also holds, jointly with the Parliament, the budgetary power of the Union and has greater control than the Parliament over the more intergovernmental areas of the EU, such as foreign policy and macroeconnomic co-ordination. Finally, before the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> of the Treaty of Lisbon, it formally held the executive power of the EU which it conferred upon the European Commission.|$|E
5|$|The Treaty on Increased Integration in the Economic and Humanitarian Fields {{signed in}} 1996 laid the first {{foundation}} for economic convergence. The treaty ensured {{the creation of}} a permanent executive organ to oversee integration of states that later would be part of the EEU. It served as the blueprint for the future common market for goods, services, capital and labour. The Single Economic Space established a single market across the territory of Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan. In 2015 with the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> of the EEU Agreement, the single market was expanded to include Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. The countries represent a market of some 183 million people and a combined GDP of around $4 trillion.|$|E

50|$|While the {{regiment}} {{is the oldest}} of the Regular Force armoured regiments, its Regular Force component takes its precedence from its date of <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> the Regular <b>Force</b> (1968). The Reserve Force component continues to take its precedence from 1871 within the Reserve Force.|$|R
5|$|The Presidency of the Council is not {{a single}} post, but is held by a member state's government. Every six months the {{presidency}} rotates between the states, in an order predefined by the Council's members, allowing each state to preside over the body. From 2007, every three member states co-operate for their combined eighteen months on a common agenda, although only one formally holds the presidency for the normal six-month period. For example, the President for the second half of 2007, Portugal, was the second in a trio of states alongside Germany and Slovenia with whom Portugal had been co-operating. The Council meets in various configurations (as outlined below) so its membership changes depending upon the issue. The person chairing the Council will always be the member from the state holding the Presidency. A delegate from the following Presidency also assists the presiding member and may take over work if requested. The exception however is the foreign affairs council, which has been chaired by the High Representative since the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> of the Lisbon Treaty.|$|E
25|$|Article 11 {{requires}} the first Meeting of States Parties {{to be held}} within 12 months of the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force.</b> The first such meeting was held in Laos in November 2010.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> of the Treaty of Lisbon, the Union {{comprised}} {{a system}} of three legal pillars, of which only the European Communities pillar had its own legal personality. The Treaty of Lisbon abolished this pillar system, and as a consolidated entity, the European Union succeeded the legal personality of the European Communities. Therefore, the EU is now able to sign international treaties in its own name. The European Union gained for example membership of the World Trade Organization immediately after the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> of the Treaty of Lisbon, since the European Communities was already {{a member of that}} organisation.|$|E
5000|$|The respondents’ {{perception}} of their roles as soldiers was reflected in their notions of what a successful position was within the armed forces. [...] A successful soldier, they said, was an educated one who “sat behind a desk and completed administrative work”. However, the soldiers also explained, that although administrative tasks were appealing, their <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> the <b>force</b> was not an active choice, but instead, was done to make money and receive an education.|$|R

5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on {{opposition}} to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> {{institutions of higher}} learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> the labour <b>force,</b> or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|R
25|$|The <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> of {{the treaty}} was in doubt for a time, after its initial {{rejection}} by Irish voters in a referendum in June 2001. This referendum result was reversed in a subsequent referendum held {{a little over a}} year later.|$|E

40|$|Pattems of <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> first {{marriage}} among recent birth cohorts (1952 - 1967) {{of young adults}} are examined based upon the U. S. Census Bureau 's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). This paper attempts to illustrate {{the manner in which}} young adults' educational and employmeni histories influence the timing oftheir <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> marriage. Labor <b>force</b> integration - concluding one's education and entering the labor force - is treated as the dominant life course process. Though the paper is primarily descriptive and exploratory, it does reveal several interesting developments: the tendency for American men and women to enter marriage early, relative to their West German peers, continues {{at the same time as}} the average age of men and women upon <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> {{first marriage}} increases in both countries. Moreover, the rising age at first marriage cuts across all education levels. Thus, the popul 4 r notion that increases in average age at first marriage may be attributed to people remaining in school longer is, by itself insufficient. Finally, contrary to Claims that disorderly pattems of transition to adulthood have undermined the traditional pattern of transition (completion of Sch 6 dling, <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> the work <b>force</b> and then marriage), the majority of men and women in both countries continue to follow the traditional path...|$|R

But with the <b>entry</b> <b>into</b> <b>force</b> of the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494, the island was in the Portuguese hemisphere.

30|$|Finally, {{changes in}} the labour force during the {{recession}} were almost positive in all countries, reflecting that the decrease in employment was counteracted by the increase in unemployment plus <b>entries</b> <b>into</b> the labour <b>force.</b> In terms of intensity, it accounted relatively much less than productivity and hours worked per worker. As already said, Spain is a notable exception, since the positive average change in the labour force was {{as high as the}} one in productivity.|$|R
