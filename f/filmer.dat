25|$|Herod died in Jericho. Based on {{the work}} of Emil Schürer in 1896, most {{scholars}} have agreed that Herod died at the end of March or early April in 4 BCE. Evidence for the 4BCE date is provided by the fact that Herod's sons, between whom his kingdom was divided, dated their rule from 4BCE, and Archelaus apparently also exercised royal authority during Herod's lifetime. Josephus states that Philip the Tetrarch's death took place after a 37-year reign, in the 20th year of Tiberius (34 CE). Other scholars have continued to support the traditional date of 1BCE. <b>Filmer</b> and Steinmann in particular have thought that Herod was named king by the Roman Senate in 39 BCE, but he died in 1 BCE, and Herod's heirs backdated their reigns to 4 or 3 BCE.|$|E

2500|$|Locke {{had other}} {{intellectual}} opponents besides Hobbes. In the First Treatise, Locke aimed his guns {{first and foremost}} {{at one of the}} doyens of 17th century English conservative philosophy: Robert <b>Filmer.</b> Filmer's Patriarcha (1680) argued for the Divine Right of Kings by appealing to biblical teaching, claiming that the authority granted to Adam by God gave successors of Adam in the male line of descent a right of dominion over all other humans and creatures in the world. Locke disagreed so thoroughly and obsessively with <b>Filmer,</b> however, that the First Treatise is almost a sentence-by-sentence refutation of Patriarcha. Reinforcing his respect for consensus, Locke argued that [...] "conjugal society is made up by a voluntary compact between men and women". Locke maintained that the grant of dominion in Genesis was not to men over women, as <b>Filmer</b> believed, but to humans over animals. [...] Locke was certainly no feminist by modern standards, but the first major liberal thinker in history accomplished an equally major task on the road to making the world more pluralistic: the integration of women into social theory.|$|E

2500|$|Although many 16th and 17th Century theorists {{agreed with}} Aristotle's views {{concerning}} {{the place of}} women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation {{on the basis of}} the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir Robert <b>Filmer.</b> Sometime before 1653, <b>Filmer</b> completed a work entitled Patriarcha. [...] However, it was not published until after his death. [...] In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from Adam, the first man of the human species, according to Judeo-Christian tradition. However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – Diderot's Encyclopedia denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, [...] "...reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The venue {{is first}} {{referenced}} in 1646, in {{the records of}} a court case following a cricket match played there on 29 May. The case concerned non-payment of a wager that was made at the game. Curiously, the wager was for twelve candles, not for money. The participants included {{members of the local}} gentry, which is further evidence of the sport's growing affluence. The match has the added interest of being an [...] "odds" [...] game in that Samuel <b>Filmer</b> and Thomas Harlackenden played as a pair, and won, against four of Maidstone: Walter Franklyn, Richard Marsh, Robert Sanders and William Cooper.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{institutions}} have attributed {{the beginnings of}} the practice of collage to Picasso and Braque in 1912, however, early Victorian photocollage suggest collage techniques were practiced in the early 1860s. Many institutions recognize these works as memorabilia for hobbyists, though they functioned as a facilitator of Victorian aristocratic collective portraiture, proof of female erudition, and presented a new mode of artistic representation that questioned the way in which photography is truthful. In 2009, curator Elizabeth Siegel organized the exhibition: Playing with Pictures [...] at the Art Institute Chicago to acknowledge collage works by Alexandra of Denmark and Mary Georgina <b>Filmer</b> among others. The exhibition later traveled to The Metropolitan Museum of Art and The Art Gallery of Ontario.|$|E
