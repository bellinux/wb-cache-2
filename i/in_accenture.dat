40|$|Learning {{from high}} {{performance}} projects {{is crucial for}} software process improvement. Therefore, we need to identify outstanding projects that may serve as role models. It is common to measure productivity {{as an indicator of}} performance. It is vital that productivity measurements deal correctly with variable returns to scale and multivariate data. Software projects generally exhibit variable returns to scale, and the output from ERP projects is multivariate. We propose to use Data Envelopment Analysis Variable Returns to Scale (DEA VRS) to measure the productivity of software projects. DEA VRS fulfils the two requirements stated above, and to our knowledge, it is the only method complying with them. The results from this empirical study of 30 ERP projects extracted from a benchmarking database <b>in</b> <b>Accenture</b> identified six projects as potential role models. These projects deserve to be studied and probably copied as part of a software process improvement initiative. The results also suggest that there is a 50 % potential for productivity improvement, on average. Finally, the results support the assumption of variable returns to scale in ERP projects. We recommend DEA VRS be used as the default technique for appropriate productivity comparisons of software projects. Used together with methods for hypothesis testing, DEA VRS is also a useful technique for assessing the effect of alleged process improvements...|$|E

40|$|As we {{move into}} the second decade of this century, the global {{business}} world is more connected, interdependent and transient than any other time in history. Consequently, we are experiencing severe talent shortages in terms of requisite skills, knowledge, and attitudes for businesses to succeed in the future. The noticeable trend towards new models of corporate citizenship and corporate social responsibility not only advances the need for different skills in the future, but also provides potential solutions for our talent issues. One of these new models gaining attention and popularity is Employee-Based Corporate Citizenship (EBCC), which includes any company-sponsored corporate citizenship programs that rely on the effort and involvement of employees to implement and sustain related initiative. EBCC programs hold great promise as a 2 ̆ 2 triple bottom line 2 ̆ 2 strategy: the company benefits in terms of image (socially responsible), employee engagement (recruitment and retention), and market growth (new ventures); the community benefits from organized and affordable access to skilled and dedicated employees who were otherwise beyond reach; and employees potentially benefit in terms of stronger connections to the community and opportunities to give back, as well as skill-building and personal growth. Accordingly, this case study takes {{a closer look at the}} employee experience <b>in</b> <b>Accenture</b> Development Partnerships (ADP), a grassroots EBCC initiative created and managed by Accenture employees, in order to understand the implications of participating in ADP assignments. Interesting to note, while the original intent was to explore the employee implications of participation through learning and development lens, the findings ultimately suggest that a more inclusive, holistic view of the employee experience is more useful. Therefore, employee implications regarding a broader talent management framework are ultimately explored. ^ At a time when companies are in dire need of innovative employee recruitment, development, retention, and engagement strategies, EBCC programs might offer cost-effective solutions when they are integrated and aligned with business and social responsibility strategies. Despite important implications for Human Resource professionals and business executives, there is very little research to date regarding the experience, impact, and outcomes for employees who participate in their companies 2 ̆ 7 EBCCs programs. ...|$|E
