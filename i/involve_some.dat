On April 30, 2008, Rodman was arrested {{following}} a domestic violence incident at a Los Angeles hotel. On June 24, 2008, he {{pleaded no contest}} to the misdemeanor spousal battery charges {{and was sentenced to}} one year of domestic violence counseling and three years probation.

5|$|Many {{language}} studies, {{particularly in}} fMRI, use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain activation in a task thought to <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> aspect of language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes {{but not to}} involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processingthe processing of real words), or activations while participants read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.|$|E
5|$|With NHL players {{participating}} in the tournament, IIHF officials began to fear that true amateurs and young players were losing their places. As a result, full world championship status {{was given to the}} IIHF World Under-20 Championship, which had been held annually since 1974 as an unofficial invitational tournament. Colloquially known as the World Junior Hockey Championship, the event was structured after the World Championships, but limited to players under the age of 20. The World Under-18 Championship was established in 1999 and typically held in April. It usually does not <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> of the top North American-based players because they are involved in junior league playoffs at the time.|$|E

25|$|O'Neill's plays {{were among}} the first to include speeches in American vernacular and involve {{characters}} on the fringes of society. They struggle to maintain their hopes and aspirations, but ultimately slide into disillusionment and despair. Of his very few comedies, only one is well-known (Ah, Wilderness!). Nearly all of his other plays <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> degree of tragedy and personal pessimism.|$|E

25|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, there was not so much a national system as a venerable patchwork of production, distribution, and taxation. The salt trade in one province, Hunan, was estimated to <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> 1,000 traders, six to nine thousand junkmen, and about 1,000 state employees and officials, including police. In the broader Lianghuai region altogether some 369,000 people were employed, including 230,000 laborers in the salt fields.|$|E

25|$|For many engineers, {{technical}} work {{accounts for}} {{only a fraction of}} the work they do. A lot of time may also be spent on tasks such as discussing proposals with clients, preparing budgets and determining project schedules. Many senior engineers manage a team of technicians or other engineers and for this reason project management skills are important. Most engineering projects <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> form of documentation and strong written communication skills are therefore very important.|$|E
25|$|Numerous expeditions {{have been}} {{undertaken}} to Africa {{in search of}} Mokèlé-mbèmbé. During these, there were some sightings that have been argued by cryptozoologists to <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> unidentified dinosaur-like creature. Additionally, {{there have been several}} specific Mokèlé-mbèmbé-hunting expeditions. Although several of the expeditions have reported close encounters, none have been able to provide incontrovertible proof that the creature exists. The sole evidence that has been found is the presence of widespread folklore and anecdotal accounts covering a considerable period of time.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiation}} of a snowball Earth event would <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> initial cooling mechanism, which {{would result in}} an increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice. The increase in Earth's coverage of snow and ice would in turn increase Earth's albedo, which would result in positive feedback for cooling. If enough snow and ice accumulates, run-away cooling would result. This positive feedback is facilitated by an equatorial continental distribution, which would allow ice to accumulate in the regions closer to the equator, where solar radiation is most direct.|$|E

25|$|In some apparitions {{an image}} is {{reported}} absent any verbal interaction. An {{example is the}} reported apparitions at Our Lady of Assiut in which many people reported a bright image atop a building. Photographs at times suggest {{the silhouette of a}} statue of the Virgin Mary but the images are subject to varying interpretations, and critics suggest that they may just be due to various visual effects. However, such image-like appearances are hardly ever reported for visions of Jesus and Mary. In most cases these <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> form of reported communication.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{dystonia}} {{is suspected}} when the dystonia {{is the only}} sign {{and there is no}} identifiable cause or structural abnormality in the central nervous system. It is suspected to be caused by a pathology of the central nervous system, likely originating in those parts of the brain concerned with motor function, such as the basal ganglia, and the GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) producing Purkinje neurons. The precise cause of primary dystonia is unknown. In many cases it may <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> genetic predisposition towards the disorder combined with environmental conditions.|$|E
25|$|Wormholes are conjectural distortions in spacetime that theorists {{postulate}} could connect two arbitrary {{points in}} the universe, across an Einstein–Rosen Bridge. It is not known whether wormholes are possible in practice. Although there are solutions to the Einstein equation of general relativity that allow for wormholes, all of the currently known solutions <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> assumption, for example the existence of negative mass, which may be unphysical. However, Cramer et al. argue that such wormholes might have been created in the early universe, stabilized by cosmic string. The general theory of wormholes is discussed by Visser in the book Lorentzian Wormholes.|$|E

25|$|Both EMG and NCS <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> {{measure of}} discomfort. EMG {{involves}} the use of a tiny needle that is inserted into specific muscles to test the associated muscle and nerve function. Both EMG & NCS involve very mild shocks that in normal patients are comparable to a rubber band snapping on the skin. Although these tests can be very useful in CRPS, thorough informed consent needs to be obtained prior to the procedure, particularly in patients experiencing severe allodynia. In spite of the utility of the test, these patients may wish to decline the procedure in order to avoid discomfort.|$|E
25|$|Treatment may <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> {{combination}} of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and bone marrow transplant, {{in addition to}} supportive care and palliative care as needed. Certain types of leukemia may be managed with watchful waiting. The success of treatment depends {{on the type of}} leukemia and the age of the person. Outcomes have improved in the developed world. The average five-year survival rate is 57% in the United States. In children under 15, the five-year survival rate is greater than 60 to 85%, {{depending on the type of}} leukemia. In children with acute leukemia who are cancer-free after five years, the cancer is unlikely to return.|$|E
25|$|The act {{of killing}} oneself is not {{applicable}} to an omnipotent being, since, despite {{that such an}} act does <b>involve</b> <b>some</b> power, it also involves a lack of power: the human person who can kill himself is already not indestructible, and, in fact, every agent constituting his environment is more powerful in some ways than himself. In other words, all non-omnipotent agents are concretely synthetic: constructed as contingencies of other, smaller, agents, meaning that they, unlike an omnipotent agent, logically can exist not only in multiple instantiation (by being constructed out of the more basic agents they are made of), but are each bound to a different location in space contra transcendent omnipresence.|$|E
