5|$|<b>Inshore</b> {{lifeboats}} (ILBs) {{are smaller}} boats that operate {{closer to the}} shore and in shallower waters than ALBs. There are two classes, inflatables and RIBs capable of 25–40 knots. The RNLI's <b>Inshore</b> Lifeboat Centre at Cowes, Isle of Wight, has been building lifeboats since the 1960s and by 2015 had produced over 1,600.|$|E
5|$|With {{the charts}} {{that he had}} made with Barrington in 1775 the <b>inshore</b> {{squadron}} at Brest was able to keep a much tighter blockade. In one incident, the <b>inshore</b> squadron sighted several French ships leaving Brest. Sir Edward Pellew, captain of HMS Impétueux, gave chase. The rear admiral in charge of the <b>inshore</b> squadron recalled him, worried that the Impétueux would run aground. The French escaped. After several letters went {{back and forth between the}} two admirals, St Vincent, tired of his subordinate's excuses, took the entire offshore squadron and sailed them between the <b>inshore</b> squadron and the shore thus proving that the ships had a shallow enough draught to have given chase and captured the French. St Vincent then wrote to the rear admiral and suggested that he strike his flag and return to shore for some needed rest.|$|E
5|$|After the Second World War, radar made painted {{camouflage}} less effective, though <b>inshore</b> craft {{continue to}} use camouflage schemes alongside anti-radar stealth.|$|E
5|$|It was at {{this stage}} that the attack began to go seriously wrong. Strong winds blowing off the land swept the smoke screen {{into the face of}} the {{advancing}} cruisers, blinding their commanders who attempted to navigate by dead reckoning. The same wind disclosed the <b>Inshore</b> Squadron to the German defenders who immediately opened up a withering fire on the blockships. With their volunteer crews suffering heavy casualties, the commanders increased speed despite the poor visibility and continued groping through the narrow channels <b>inshore,</b> searching for the Stroom Bank buoy which directed shipping into the canal.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this {{assignment}} that she suffered a near-catastrophe when she ran aground on Pearl Rock, near Gibraltar in 1871 and nearly sank. Agincourt was leading the <b>inshore</b> column of ships, contrary to normal practice where the senior flagship lead the <b>inshore</b> column, and gently ran aground sideways when the senior flagship's navigator failed {{to compensate for the}} set of the tide. Warrior, immediately following her, nearly collided with her, but managed to sheer off in time.|$|E
5|$|By November 1808, the Napoleonic Wars {{had lasted}} five years. Although the French had conquered large swathes of {{mainland}} Europe, {{they were unable}} to exert any significant influence at sea, where the British Royal Navy had been dominant since the Battle of Trafalgar in October 1805. A vital part of Royal Navy strategy was the implementation of a close blockade of the major French seaports by squadrons of frigates and ships of the line, intended to intercept and capture any ships attempting to enter or leave French harbours. The greatest French Atlantic seaport, and consequently the most important target for the Royal Navy, was Brest, situated on the Northern Biscay coast. Watching Brest were a large number of warships, divided into the <b>inshore</b> squadron designed to watch the coast directly and formed principally of frigates and small fast vessels, and the offshore squadron formed from heavy ships of the line and tasked with intercepting French fleets and battle squadrons spotted by the <b>inshore</b> squadron.|$|E
5|$|Emeralds boats {{participated in}} a cutting-out {{expedition}} in Viveiro harbour on 13 March 1808. While cruising <b>inshore</b> at around 17:00, Emerald spotted a large French schooner, Apropos, of 250 tons (bm), anchored in the bay. Apropos was armed with twelve 8-pounder guns, though pierced for 16, and had a crew of more than 70 men {{under the command of}} lieutenant de vaisseau Lagary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years of the French Revolutionary Wars, {{although}} the French Navy had sought to oppose the Royal Navy at sea from their main base at Brest in Brittany, the Royal Navy had achieved victories at the Glorious First of June and Battle of Groix. The losses inflicted on the French Atlantic fleet in these battles were compounded by large numbers of ships wrecked in storms during the disastrous Croisière du Grand Hiver and Expédition d'Irlande operations. By 1798 the Royal Navy was unopposed in its control of the Atlantic, enforcing its supremacy by a strategy of close blockade, maintaining a battle fleet at sea off Brittany and an <b>inshore</b> squadron of frigates watching the approaches to Brest. In June 1798 the <b>inshore</b> squadron included a detachment comprising the 38-gun HMS Jason under Captain Charles Stirling, the 36-gun HMS Pique under Captain David Milne and 32-gun HMS Mermaid under Captain James Newman-Newman.|$|E
5|$|The Lords {{continued}} to suggest amendments to money bills over {{which it had}} no right of veto and in several instances, these were accepted by the Commons. These included the China Indemnity Bill 1925 and the <b>Inshore</b> Fishing Industry Bill 1947. The use of the Lords' now temporary veto remains a powerful check on legislation.|$|E
5|$|The creek whaler {{is a minor}} bycatch of <b>inshore</b> gillnet {{fisheries}} {{operating in}} northern Australia; the meat is sold for human consumption. Given its relatively high reproductive rate, its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing. Therefore, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Villaret, {{believing that}} the {{stronger}} British fleet would destroy his own 12 ships of the line, ordered his force to fall back to the <b>inshore</b> anchorage off Groix, hoping to take shelter in protected coastal waters. Several of his ships were too slow, falling behind so that {{early in the morning}} of 23 June the rearmost ships of his fleet were caught by the British vanguard, overhauled one by one and brought to battle. Although Villaret fought a determined rearguard action, three French ships were captured, all with very heavy casualties, and the remainder of the French fleet was left scattered across miles of coastline. In this position they were highly vulnerable to continued British attack, but after only a few hours' engagement, concerned that his ships might be wrecked on the rocky coastline, Bridport called off the action and allowed Villaret to regroup <b>inshore</b> and retreat to Lorient.|$|E
5|$|At 15:00 Lhermitte {{ordered the}} masts on Preneuse {{to be cut}} away and the frigate and battery then opened fire on Adamant, which was {{carefully}} sailing through the coastal shoals {{in an effort to}} engage the beached French ship. For more than two hours Hotham's ship worked its way <b>inshore</b> until at 17:30 it was well positioned to open fire, unleashing its broadside on the wrecked Preneuse. By 17:45 it was clear that further resistance was futile and Lhermitte struck his colours. Preneuse had surrendered, but was likely damaged beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|Bompart's {{squadron}} departed Brest {{late in the}} evening, {{hoping to}} slip past the <b>inshore</b> British blockade in the dark. However, they took too long to navigate the Raz passage, and were spotted at dawn on 17 September by a frigate squadron under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats, in HMS Boadicea. Keats immediately divided his forces, ordering HMS Ethalion under Captain George Countess and the brig HMS Sylph under Commander John Chambers White to follow the French force, while Keats brought news of the French movements to Admiral Lord Bridport, admiral of the Channel Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. The whales make seasonal <b>inshore</b> {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|By July 1929 {{the last}} of the {{superstructure}} had been cleared, and Bremse was turned upside down using techniques developed on salvaging some of the destroyers. Compressors were then used to pump air into the hull and bring her to the surface, while she was supported by 9-inch wires attached to two floating docks anchored on her port shoreward side. The salvage teams had almost raised her when she suddenly toppled onto her side and then heeled over gradually during the night, settling onto the rocks <b>inshore.</b>|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{services}} {{are provided by}} the States of Jersey Police {{with the support of}} the Honorary Police as necessary, States of Jersey Ambulance Service, Jersey Fire and Rescue Service and the Jersey Coastguard. The Jersey Fire and Rescue Service and the Royal National Lifeboat Institution operate an <b>inshore</b> rescue and lifeboat service; Channel Islands Air Search provides rapid response airborne search of the surrounding waters.|$|E
5|$|Even though Operation Teardrop was {{undertaken}} {{in the part of}} the North Atlantic for which Canada had primary responsibility, Ingram did not seek assistance from the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) at any stage of the engagement. Moreover, Ingram did not provide the Canadian military with a situation report until after the sinking of U-518. However, aircraft of the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) flew offensive patrols in support of the American effort, and the RCN and RCAF intensified their patrols of <b>inshore</b> waters around Halifax.|$|E
5|$|Fisher's {{desire for}} a shallow draught was not merely based {{on the need to}} allow for <b>inshore</b> operations; ships tended to operate closer to deep load than {{anticipated}} and were often found lacking in freeboard, reserve buoyancy and safety against underwater attack. This experience led the DNC to reconsider the proportions of the hull to rectify the problems identified thus far. The Courageous-class ships were the first products of that re-evaluation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, the {{establishment}} of Russian naval power in the Baltic challenged the interests of Sweden, at the time {{one of the major}} powers in the Baltic. The Swedish Empire at the time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of the Baltic states, a dominion held together by the Baltic sea routes. Russian Tsar Peter the Great had established a new capital and naval base in Saint Petersburg in 1703. During the Great Northern War 1700–1721 Sweden lost its Baltic state territories, and experienced destructive Russian raiding in Finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos that stretched {{all the way from the}} Gulf of Finland to the capital of Stockholm. The traumatic experience led to {{the establishment of}} <b>inshore</b> flotillas of shallow-draft vessels. The first of these consisted mainly of smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean warship, the galleys. Most of these more akin to galiots and were complemented with gun prams. The disastrous war against Russia 1741-43 and the minor involvement in Prussia in the Pomeranian War 1757–62 showed the need for further expansion and development of the <b>inshore</b> flotillas with more specialized vessels.|$|E

5|$|<b>Inshore</b> and inland {{commercial}} and military diving is regulated by legislation in many countries. Responsibility of the employer, client and diving personnel is specified in these cases; offshore commercial diving may {{take place in}} international waters, and is often done following the guidelines of a voluntary membership organisation such as the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), which publishes codes of accepted best practice which their member organisations are expected to follow.|$|E
5|$|Lobatus gigas {{lives at}} depths from 0.3–18m to 25–35m. Its depth range {{is limited by}} the {{distribution}} of seagrass and algae cover. In heavily exploited areas, the queen conch is more abundant in the deepest range. The queen conch lives in seagrass meadows and on sandy substrate, usually in association with turtle grass (species of the genus Thalassia, specifically Thalassia testudinum and also Syringodium sp.) and manatee grass (Cymodocea sp.). Juveniles inhabit shallow, <b>inshore</b> seagrass meadows, while adults favor deeper algal plains and seagrass meadows.|$|E
5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation <b>inshore,</b> {{on or near}} the continental margin (perhaps as a result of transcurrent extension, or of a slab window). All current models then have Siletzia rifting away from the continental edge about a northern pivot.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 1945, the United States Third Fleet sortied from Leyte Gulf in the Philippines {{under the}} command of Admiral William Halsey to attack the Japanese home islands. Halsey's plans {{included}} the use of battleships and cruisers to bombard military facilities and factories. To prepare for these attacks, US Navy submarines sailed into Japan's <b>inshore</b> waters to search for naval mines. USAAF B-29 Superfortress and B-24 Liberator aircraft also conducted photo reconnaissance flights over much of Japan in search of airfields and facilities which could be attacked by the Third Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Russian Tsar Peter the Great had {{established}} a new capital and powerful naval base in Saint Petersburg in 1703. Russian naval power in the Baltic grew to challenge the interests of Sweden, the other leading power in the Baltic. Swedish holdings at that time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland {{and most of the}} Baltic states, a dominion depending on, and connected by, the Baltic Sea trade routes. During the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Sweden lost all its territories in the Baltic states and suffered Russian raids in Finland and along the chain of islands and archipelagos stretching from the Gulf of Finland to Stockholm. The Swedes began to deploy <b>inshore</b> flotillas of shallow-draft vessels, beginning with smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean galleys.

5|$|The Burnham-on-Sea Area Rescue Boat {{now known}} as BARB Search & Rescue {{was set up in}} 1992 to fund and operate rescue craft in the Bridgwater Bay area. BARB's boat house on the sea front was built in 1994 by the Challenge Anneka TV show. In 2002, Lelaina Hall, a five-year-old girl from Worcester, died on the mud flats before help could reach her. The outcry over her death {{prompted}} a Western Daily Press campaign to fund an <b>inshore</b> hovercraft.|$|E
5|$|The Environmental Protection Agency has {{designated}} the Corpus Christi Bay system as an estuary of national significance. More than 234 {{species of fish}} {{are found in the}} bay, including the Gafftopsail catfish, Hardhead catfish, Atlantic croaker, Atlantic cutlassfish, Black drum, Red drum, Southern flounder, Crevalle jack, Ladyfish, <b>Inshore</b> lizardfish, Atlantic midshipman, Silver perch, Pinfish, Smooth puffer, Scaled sardine, Bighead searobin, Sand seatrout, Spotted seatrout, Sheepshead, Gray snapper, Common snook, and the Tripletail.|$|E
5|$|The French ships took shelter at {{the heavily}} {{fortified}} Iles Saint-Marcouf, sailing {{the following morning}} for the anchorage at Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue. For two days the British frigates kept watch, until two ships of the line from the blockade of Cherbourg, HMS Donegal and HMS Revenge, arrived. On 15 November, the British squadron attacked the anchored French ships, which were defended by shore batteries at La Hougue and Tatihou. After four attempts to close with the French the British squadron, under heavy fire, withdrew. During the night, the British commander, Captain Pulteney Malcolm, sent his ship's boats close <b>inshore</b> to attack the French ships with Congreve rockets, a newly issued weapon. None are recorded as landing on target, but by morning both frigates {{had been forced to}} change position, becoming grounded on the shore. The French ships were later refloated, and Malcolm's squadron maintained the blockade until 27 November when Amazone successfully escaped back to Le Havre. The damaged Elisa remained at anchor until 6 December, when an attack by a British bomb vessel forced the frigate to move further <b>inshore,</b> becoming grounded once more. Elisa remained in this position until 23 December, when the boats of Diana entered the anchorage at night and set the beached ship on fire, destroying her.|$|E
5|$|The MTB had {{withdrawn}} {{out of range}} at about 01:30, but not before it had suffered engine damage; a bullet had disabled the starboard engine. After 10 minutes it moved back <b>inshore</b> hoping to pick up any survivors. It was again located by the Germans at about 02:30. The MTB was forced to withdraw once again under increasingly heavy mortar and machine gun fire. Unable to locate any survivors, it recrossed the German minefield and arrived back in Portsmouth at 10:00.|$|E
5|$|The Royal National Lifeboat Institution {{stationed}} an <b>inshore</b> lifeboat at Bournemouth between 1965 and 1972. Coverage for {{the area}} has otherwise been provided from Poole Lifeboat Station. The Bournemouth International Centre (BIC), a large conference and exhibition centre, was constructed near the seafront in 1984, and {{in the following year}} Bournemouth became the first town in the United Kingdom to introduce and use CCTV cameras for public street-based surveillance.|$|E
5|$|The Support Group {{operated}} {{a mixture of}} gun, rocket, flak, tank, and smoke landing craft, totaling 67 vessels. The Minesweeper Group comprised four flotillas, the 4th comprising nine Royal Navy minesweepers; the 31st comprising nine minesweepers of the Royal Canadian Navy; the 104th comprising ten Royal Navy <b>inshore</b> minesweepers; and the 167th comprising ten Royal Navy coastal minesweepers. Bombarding Force C comprised two battleships, three cruisers (two Free French and one Royal Navy), and 13 destroyers (three of which were provided by the Royal Navy).|$|E
5|$|The diet of {{the creek}} whaler {{consists}} mainly of small teleost fishes and crustaceans. It is viviparous, with the unborn young being sustained through a placental connection. The defined mating season lasts from May to July. Females give birth to one to seven pups annually, following a gestation period of seven to 9 months. A small number of creek whalers are caught incidentally in <b>inshore</b> gillnets and used for food, but the effect of fishing on its population seems to be inconsequential. As a result, the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|The first Royal National Lifeboat {{was funded}} by the town of Cheltenham, and arrived in 1866. The {{lifeboat}} was removed in 1930 because of the difficulty in getting a full crew, and because the launching arrangements were not suitable for a powered boat. The current Burnham-on-Sea Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations. The present station was opened in 2003. It operates two <b>inshore</b> lifeboats (ILBs), a B Class rigid-hulled boat and an inflatable D Class.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} grew {{slowly in the}} 17th century: St. John's was Newfoundland's largest settlement when English naval officers began to take censuses around 1675. The {{population grew}} in the summers {{with the arrival of}} migratory fishermen. In 1680, fishing ships (mostly from South Devon) set up fishing rooms at St. John's, bringing hundreds of Irish men into the port to operate <b>inshore</b> fishing boats.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the finless sleeper ray extends from the eastern Andaman Sea, near {{southern}} border between Thailand and Myanmar, through the Strait of Malacca to Singapore, and northward to Vietnam. Its exact distribution off Thailand is uncertain. There is a single record of this species from Sarawak in Borneo. This bottom-dwelling species inhabits fine sediment habitat over the continental shelf in both <b>inshore</b> and offshore waters. In the 19th century, it was reportedly abundant year-round in the Straits of Malacca. It is locally common in some areas.|$|E
