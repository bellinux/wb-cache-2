30|$|Rhino {{provides}} more than 30 different ways for users to draw various lines (e.g., line <b>drawing,</b> <b>curve</b> drawing, arc drawing). Due to its various methods of drawing, Rhino tools {{have more than}} 2000 functions, which make almost impossible to handle all of the tools during the class activities of one semester. Therefore, its most important and common functions during the 3 D modeling process were introduced in the classes (e.g., drawing lines and extruding them, revolving lines to make a surface, cutting surfaces and transforming them, copying them in symmetrical directions as a mirror function, arranging them). This practice was performed for the 4  weeks of the total 16 -week class period.|$|E

Infrared {{analysis was used to}} detect the degradation products and the carbonyl index was related to the photooxidation products. The changes in mechanical properties due to the chemical degradation were followed by determining the <b>drawing</b> <b>curve</b> and the elastic modulus. All the mechanical parameters were correlated to the exposure time and to the carbonyl index, determined on the same samples. The change in the carbonyl index and the mechanical parameters with the exposure time allowed the determination of the point beyond which the material becomes useless. Furthermore, it was possible to calculate the ratio between natural and artificial time of degradation, which was found to be about 30...|$|E
40|$|Background: Leptospirosis is an {{important}} issue in Yogyakarta Province. Outbreak status had set in Sleman, Bantul, and Kulonprogo District. The border areas have the most cases. This study aims to analyze: distribution of the disease; cluster based on the buffer of distance from case 2 ̆ 7 s home to rice fields, rivers, and roads; determined clusters; as well as observed patterns of disease diffusion and frequency over time. Methods: This study was an observational study. 327 subjects obtained from all cases of Leptospirosis who were reported in District Health Office from 2009 - 2011 and living in seven sub-districts, namely Sedayu, Minggir, Moyudan, Godean, Sentolo, Nanggulan, and Kalibawang. We performed a descriptiveanalysis of leptospirosis distribution; a buffer analysis of distance between home and rice fields,riversandroads; cluster analysis; disease diffussion analysis and <b>drawing</b> <b>curve</b> of disease frequencyover time. Results: 1) Most of thecasesweredistributedin the agricultural area, area drained by many riverstreams, and area with moderate rainfall(2000 - 2500 mm/year). There was nospecificdistribution patterninoverlay of cases map with mapsof population density, density ofpoor households, altitude, anddensity oflivestock. 2) Buffer analysis showed a cluster based on the distance between caseshomewithrice fields,rivers, androads. 3) All cases in the seven sub-district was one unit cluster. The area is the most widely drained by large and small rivers. Cluster scores are higher in areas with the highest deprivation scores and has the most widely watershed. We found some Leptospirosis clusters which were across-district, across sub districts, and across the river. 4) Disease diffusion of Leptospirosis cases was an infectious type of expansion diffusion. There was a seasonal pattern according to the planting season {{and the beginning of the}} rainy season. There was a trend of increase in Leptospirosis cases from year to year. Conclusion: Leptospirosis disease in the border of Bantul, Sleman, and Kulonprogo District were not spread through the river from one region to another, but very much related to the watershed. Research area which is a cluster is an area drained by many rivers, so it become moist soils and conducive for farming and supports the development and growth of Leptospira and harvest mouse. Cross-sectoral prevention measures must be carried out...|$|E

The splines were held in place with lead weights (called ducks because of their duck-like shape). The elasticity of the spline material combined with the constraint of the control points, or knots, would cause the strip to take the shape that minimized the energy required for bending it between the fixed points, this being the smoothest possible shape.|$|R
