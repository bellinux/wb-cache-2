The <b>escape</b> <b>codes</b> received from the terminal signify things such as function key, arrow key, and other special keystrokes (home key, end key, help key, PgUp key, PgDn key, insert key, delete key, and so forth).|$|R

5000|$|According to Secunia, [...] "The {{vulnerability}} {{is caused}} {{due to an}} error in the handling of Windows Metafile files ('.wmf') containing specially crafted [...] 'Escape' records.

[...] According to the Windows 3.1 SDK documentation, the [...] escape was obsoleted and replaced by {{the function of the}} same name in Windows 3.1, long before the WMF vulnerability was discovered. However the obsoleted <b>escape</b> <b>code</b> was retained for compatibility with 16 bit programs written for (or at least backwards compatible with) Windows 3.0. This change happened at approximately the same time as Microsoft was creating the 32 bit reimplementation of GDI for Windows NT, and {{it is likely that the}} vulnerability occurred during this effort.|$|E
50|$|This type {{of event}} is signalled with a DLE message, {{which is a}} single-{{character}} message preceded by a Data Link <b>Escape</b> <b>code.</b> DLE is a character sent from the modem to the computer whose definition is unrelated to either command or data mode, and which uses a specific ASCII code (0x10) which never occurs in any AT commands or responses, {{so that it can}} be isolated from the command/response stream on that merit alone. In these modes, whenever a DLE (0x10) is sent, the character following it has a special non-command and non-data meaning. For example, a DLE followed by the number 2 means the caller pressed the number 2 on his telephone keypad. This could happen in either command or data mode so long as the phone line is in use by the modem and someone is on the other end of the line.|$|E

40|$|M. Ing. This {{dissertation}} will aim {{to indicate}} a methodology on how to manage fast tracked projects efficiently and effectively. Initially, some conventional project management methods will be investigated. By using practical knowledge obtained from working on fast track projects and data collected, alternative approaches to conventional project management techniques will be investigated and identified. An attempt {{will be made to}} derive an accurate as possible methodology and technique for managing fast track projects. Projects and project management are utilised not only in the engineering industry, but are used extensively in Banking, Advertising and numerous other areas of the economy. In most instances, the primary goal of a project is to create a system or process that will generate revenue for a company or person. This is especially true for engineering related projects, where an Engineering, Procurement, Construction Management (EPCM) company does the project for and on behalf of a separate entity or client, generating revenue for both the client and the EPCM Company. With this in mind, the economical truth “higher risk generates higher income” must be acknowledged. Project management is the tool used to manage these risks so as to ensure the highest possible income and profit margin, without taking unacceptably high risks. The project management methodology implemented must define the level of acceptable risk and must be able to identify advances in available technology, building methods, etc. so as to ensure as high as possible risk hence ensuring the highest possible revenue. In recent years these advances were so great that it initiated a complete methodology shift in the project management process, hence the term fast track projects. As a closing note one should never assume that fast track project management is an <b>escape</b> <b>code</b> for being reckless in approaching projects. If the methods are applied correctly, it can and will lead to a successful project. What should be understood from the onset {{is that there is a}} definite limit on how quickly a project can be done. This limit must be acknowledged by all seeing that going beyond this limit is reckless and will result in a disastrous project. This term is also known as a project’s terminal velocity...|$|E
