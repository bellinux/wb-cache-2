50|$|Viktor Lenac has {{successfully}} completed extensive ship repair and dry-docking of US Navy's 6th Fleet flagship USS Mount Whitney (LCC 20). This highly complex project marked {{the year as}} one of the most important ship repair projects. It occupied a large part of the shipyard resources most of 2015. The works commenced in January 2015 and were completed in August 2015. They included complete overhaul and docking of the ship, class surveys, renovation of accommodations and galleys, shell plating and deck house steel renewal. Especially interesting was the modification of the existing vessel’s electrical power supply system and the installation of new generators, switch boards and control mechanisms, and refurbishment of the fuel system, reverse osmosis system, black and gray discharge water system, fire alarm and similar. UHP water blasting of hull, Ballast tanks blasting with steel shots and application of <b>full</b> <b>coating</b> system, cleaning and gas freeing of all fuel tanks, modification of existing spaces into the new auxiliary engine room including installation of 3 new CAT generators, switch boards and control room was carried out. This is the second time that Viktor Lenac has been awarded a USS Mount Whitney contract. In 2011 the ship underwent extensive docking and class surveys.|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} in human islet (HI) {{allotransplantation}} {{is the need for}} chronic immunosuppression, that could be overcome if HI are protected against immunological attacks by biocompatible, semipermeable membranes. Whereas macro/microencapsulation techniques have given conflicting results, an attractive strategy is the use of conformal nanocoating, with reduced volumes and possible implantation into any suitable site. We coated HI by a multilayer nanoencapsulation procedure and assessed several features of the encapsulated cells. HI were isolated from 12 donors (age: 68 ± 13 yrs, BMI: 27. 9 ± 3. 0 kg/m 2, mean blood glucose during ICU stay: 163 ± 69 mg/dl). Chitosan [(Poly(D-glucosamine) deacetylated chitin) ] and PSS [(Poly(styrenesulfonic acid sodium salt) ] were dissolved (1 mg/ml) in culture medium at 37 oC for 36 h. HI were then incubated in each polymer for 15 min and nanoencapsulation was achieved through layer-by-layer electrostatic binding. Morphology, ultrastructure, viability and insulin secretion (IS) studies were performed and initial in-vivo work was also accomplished by transplanting the islets under the kidney capsule of non-diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats.

40|$|Many {{viruses that}} enter cells by clathrin-dependent {{endocytosis}} are significantly {{larger than the}} dimensions of a typical clathrin-coated vesicle. The mechanisms by which viruses co-opt the clathrin machinery for efficient internalization remain uncertain. Here we examined how clathrin-coated vesicles accommodate vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) during its entry into cells. Using high-resolution imaging of the internalization of single viral particles into cells expressing fluorescent clathrin and adaptor molecules, we show that VSV enters cells through partially clathrin-coated vesicles. We found that on average, virus-containing vesicles contain more clathrin and clathrin adaptor molecules than conventional vesicles, but this increase is insufficient to permit <b>full</b> <b>coating</b> of the vesicle. We further show that virus-containing vesicles depend upon the actin machinery for their internalization. Specifically, we found that components of the actin machinery are recruited to virus-containing vesicles, and chemical inhibition of actin polymerization trapped viral particles in vesicles at the plasma membrane. By analysis of multiple independent virus internalization events, we show that VSV induces the nucleation of clathrin for its uptake, rather than depending upon random capture by formation of a clathrin-coated pit.

30|$|As {{degradation}} generally {{starts from}} the surface of the NCA particles, surface modification has been widely adopted as an efficient method to prevent/suppress side reactions with the electrolyte for the purpose of improved cycling stability, rate capability, and thermal stability [13]. The most commonly used modification strategy is through chemical coating a uniform nanoscale protective layer of TiO 2 [14], MnO 2 [15], ZrO 2 [16], FePO 4 [17], or AlF 3 [18], etc. onto the NCA particle surface, following a process of solvent evaporation and high temperature annealing. Such wet-coating method is effective, however, requires additional post-treatment, which is time and energy consuming. On the other hand, mechanical ball-milling composites of NCA and nanoparticles such as SiO 2 [19], Ni 3 (PO 4) 2 [20], and AlF 3 [21] have also shown remarkably improved electrochemical performance. The mechanical mixing process is relatively simple, clean, low cost and poses less side effect on ion/electron transference compared to <b>full</b> <b>coating</b> an insulating layer via chemical route. But stringent control of milling speed and time is critical in order to realize homogenous dispersion of the modifying nanoparticles and at the same time remains the integration of the NCA particles. Moreover, to our best knowledge, except one NCA/graphene composite cathode prepared by ball-milling [22], almost all the reported modifiers so far are inert materials, which although showing good stability have poor electrical conductivity associated with increased polarization of the electrode materials.|$|E

40|$|The {{strength}} {{of the interaction between}} a pesticide and the soil organic matter is a key parameter to assess the risk of it reaching to groundwater with potentially harmful effects to human health. In this work, a new approach that allows measuring such interactions in a few minutes using a purified fraction of the soil organic matter (humic substances) is detailed. The {{strength of}} sorption is assessed via the normalised difference of elution (retention factor, k') between the chemical of interest and a neutral marker transported via electroosmotic flow through an open tubular column supporting the immobilised humic substances (open tubular capillary electrochromatography). The immobilisation was achieved by incubating a capillary, pre-coated with a monolayer of humic acid, with an acidic solution of humic substances. This induces the formation of a supramolecular structure of humic substances as it occurs in soils. This aggregate can easily be removed using alkaline solutions, and a new structure assembled using other humic substances (HS) or different incubations conditions. The whole procedure takes 2 h. This approach has been tested using five triazines and three types of humic substances. The order of the strength of sorption of the triazines as expected from relevant literature and the relative standard deviation of k' was between 1 and 6 %. Good repeatability was also observed after long period of wash, between re-coating and repeating of the <b>full</b> <b>coating</b> with a new capillary. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|One of {{the most}} urgent needs in {{automotive}} industry is the reduction of weight. Light cars produce less CO 2, use less energy, are easy to brake or accelerate and show a much better driving performance than heavier cars. In the case of electro vehicles, weight reduction is vital to extend the driving range - thus lightweight material is a key for modern mobility. While metal alloys already reached their technical limits, carbon fibre based car parts are still not mass producible today. This situation leads to a gap which can be filled by using carbon nanotubes (CNT) reinforced alloys to provide high-performance alloys for the mobility of tomorrow. By modifying the nano carbon (NC) surface through coating (via CVD- or Sol Gel-procedure) {{it is possible to}} further increase the interfacial bonding as well a protecting the NC from detrimental composite manufacturing processing. The metal-oxide coatings applied via this two procedures differ in structure and degree of coating. Although a <b>full</b> <b>coating</b> of the NC has not been reached so far, results in achieved in processing are encouraging. The advantages and disadvantages of both procedures for large scale application are discussed. Fraunhofer IPA has been conducting research and development of metal matrix composites (MMC) with such nano-carbon materials.

40|$|Introduction: Functionalisation of {{titanium}} (Ti) implants with {{calcium phosphate}} (CaP) {{is a widely}} used approach in orthopaedic applications to obtain a mechanically strong system that is Osteoconductive. In order to deposit CaP in a controlled way on complex 3 D Ti surfaces, like scaffolds, this study applied a perfusion electrodeposition (P-ELD) system. Materials and Methods: 3 D Ti-scaffolds were fabricated by selective laser melting. A P-ELD system was developed to deposit CaP onto Ti-scaffolds (cathode) using a platinum ring as anode. A supersaturated calcium phosphate (SCP) solution was used as electrolyte. A full factorial (24) design was performed to analyse the effect of current density (I), temperature (T), deposition time (t) and flow rate (f) {{on the characteristics of}} the deposited CaP. The parameter I and t were optimised by performing P-ELD at: (a) varying I at constant t (12 hr) and (ii) varying t at constant I (3 mA/cm 2). The coating morphology, distribution, thickness, crystalinity and Ca/P ratio were characterised by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron probe micro- analysis (EPMA). The biocompatibility of CaP-coated Ti-scaffolds was tested by live-dead staining and SEM-analysis of human periosteum derived cells (HPDCs) seeded scaffolds after 7 days of culture. Results and Discussion: CaP deposition increased with increasing t, T and f, whereas 20 & 40 mA/cm 2 of I were too high and disrupted CaP deposition. In fact, the effect of t and the t-f interaction on the CaP deposition were statistically significant (p= 0. 001 & p= 0. 019). 50 oC and 10 ml/min were selected for subsequent experiments. SEM analysis showed that P-ELD for t > 6 hr with 2 – 10 mA/cm 2 resulted in a <b>full</b> <b>coating</b> of the scaffolds, up to a thickness of 40 μm and with a Ca/P ratio of 1. 41. Interestingly, P-ELD at 5 mA/cm 2 for 6 hr produced a cauli flower-like crystal structure of 28 μm thick with a Ca/P ratio of 1. 45. XRD analysis indicated that the CaP coatings were carbonated synthetic hydroxyapatite. Live-dead staining of HPDCs cultured on coated Ti-scaffolds for 7 days showed high cell viability and biocompatibility. SEM imaging showed that the HPDCs had a fibroblastic phenotype and interacted with the CaP coating. Conclusion: Perfusion electrodeposition (P-ELD) can become a useful tool to functionalise complex Ti structures (e. g. scaffolds) with CaP, in which the physiochemical properties of the CaP coating could be controlled and optimised for effective bone formation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Total Hip Replacement (THR) {{is today}} a routine {{procedure}} executed {{more than 800}} ' 000 times per year worldwide. THR gives generally satisfactory results, although the quality of outcome is inversely proportional {{to the age of}} the patient. In parallel, there is a trend to propose cementless THR to patients younger than 60 years. These patients have more demanding physical activity resulting in a significant increased failure rate of the implants. In particular for these patients, the desired service life of the implant should be extended. Proximal peri-implant bone loss is generally observed during the first two years following the implantation. This bone loss may lead to aseptic loosening, the major cause of THR failure. In order to control peri-implant bone remodeling and in particular the proximal bone loss, we developed the innovative concept of using the orthopedic implant as drug delivery system (DDS). The cementless stem of a hip implant would be coated with hydroxyapatite (HA) and bisphosphonate, a drug affecting bone resorption. The basic idea is to biologically reduce the initial peri-implant bone loss by decreasing the osteoclastic bone resorption activity. This approach could significantly increase the THR outcome. Pre-clinical tests were performed to numerically validate this new concept. An existing bone remodeling model was modified {{to take into account the}} bisphosphonate effect. The outcome of a THR was evaluated with different simulated bisphosphonate concentrations. Results of the simulations showed that the implant used as a drug delivery system would increase bone density around the implant and decrease, at the same time, the micromovements between the implant and the surrounding bone tissue. Therefore, the evolution towards peri-implant bone loss and fibrous tissue development at the bone-implant interface would be delayed, which could positively influence the THR outcome. Pre-clinical tests allowed us to verify that a partial proximal coating of the stem would result in a homogeneous bone remodeling, a situation biomechanically more favorable than the simulated situation obtained with a <b>full</b> <b>coating</b> of the stem. Despite a numerically observed positive concentration effect, it was noted that the decrease of peri-implant bone loss was most notably affected with the intermediate simulated bisphosphonate concentration. Based on these positive pre-clinical results, in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to further validate the concept of orthopedic implant used as drug delivery system. As bisphosphonates were developed for systemic delivery, little information was available regarding the bisphosphonate concentrations which could be safely used for a local delivery application. It was especially important to quantify the bisphosphonate concentration osteoblasts could be exposed to without harmful effect for the bone formation process. We challenged osteoblasts from human and murine origins to different concentrations of the choosen bisphosphonate (Zoledronate from Novartis). As wear particles are inevitably present in the peri-implant bone, we also added titanium particles to quantify the eventual synergetic negative effect between Zoledronate and particles on osteoblast behavior. In this in vitro study, we showed that Zoledronate did not impair proliferation of human osteoblasts when used at concentrations lower or equal to 1 µM, while murine cells could be exposed to concentrations up to 10 µM. A concentration of 0. 01 % of titanium particles did not impair proliferation of either cell line. Zoledronate affected, through a chelation phenomenon, ALP activity of murine osteoblasts, whereas the presence of titanium particles strongly decreased the ALP activity of murine osteoblasts. We did not detect any synergic effect of Zoledronate and titanium particles on neither human and murine osteoblast behavior. Those results allowed us to conclude that 1 µM and 10 µM Zoledronate concentrations for human and murine respectively, could be used in the proposed drug delivery system. The basic idea behind the drug delivery system is that the bisphosphonate will stay around the implant where its effect on bone resorption is needed. Since the drug is directly brought into contact with the endosteal bone, it was necessary to study the bisphosphonate diffusion in bone. The in vitro measured Zoledronate diffusion profile in the bone showed that the bisphosphonate entered the bone and diffused from the endosteal bone towards the periosteal bone. The drug accumulated in the first millimeter of the endosteal bone. This meant that the Zoledronate would stay in the peri-implant bone and would not reach regions which are not influenced by the presence of the implant. Based on the in vitro results for Zoledronate concentrations effect on osteoblast and diffusion in bone, an in vivo experiment was designed to demonstrate the proof of concept of orthopedic implant used as drug delivery system. Several Zoledronate quantites were grafted to hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings of titanium implants. The implants were inserted in rat condyles for 3 weeks. Bone density, histomorphometric and biomechanical measurements were performed on the collected rat femurs. A concentration-dependent effect was observed on the peri-implant bone density and on different histomorphometric parameters. The Zoledronate coated implant positively influenced the structure of the trabecular bone. Biomechanical pull-out tests confirmed the higher peri-implant bone quality of Zoledronate coated implant. Interestingly, this in vivo study highlighted the existence of a window of Zoledronate coating concentration in which the mechanical fixation of the implant was increased. A similar result was suggested with the pre-clinical testing. The in vivo study allowed the demonstration of proof-of-concept for orthopedic implant used as drug delivery system to control peri-implant bone remodeling. The results obtained in this thesis might then open the way of an easy transformation of currently existing HA coated implants. By grafting bisphosphonate onto the implant HA coating, the peri-implant bone loss might be reduced which would increase the service life of a THR. This approach is especially interesting for patient younger than 60 years...|$|E
40|$|Authors: Dimitrios Vlachakis, Andrea Brancale, Colin Berry & Sophia Kossida ### Abstract A new assay for the {{measurement}} of helicase enzyme activity was developed {{for the evaluation of}} the potency of potential inhibitors. This assay involves the use of a DNA or RNA duplex substrate and recombinant purified helicase. The DNA duplex consists of a pair of oligonucleotides, one of which is biotinylated and the other is digoxygenin (DIG) -labelled, both at their respective 5 ’ termini. This DNA duplex is immobilised, via the biotin molecule, on the surface of a neutravidin-coated 96 well plate. Helicase activity results in DNA unwinding upon activation by ATP, leading to the release of the DIG labelled oligonucleotides, which translates in signal (luminescence) reduction with respect to control wells. This signal can be produced and quantified {{with the aid of a}} chemiluminescence antibody. ### Introduction Other assay methods for this type of enzyme analyse ATPase activity but assessment of the effects on the helicase unwinding activity is considered the method of choice forevaluating inhibitors of this class of enzyme (1). Helicase activity assays rely on the ability of the enzyme to displace one strand (release strand) of DNA or RNA from another (template) strand. Many reports use displacement of radio-labelled release strands, detected either after gel electrophoresis (2), thin layer chromatography (3) or scintillation counting (4). The latter method may be amenable to high-throughput screening but carries the practical disadvantages of the use of radioactive materials. Further methods have incorporated DIG labelled release strands to allow detection by ELISA (5). We propose a new combined method that uses chemiluminescent antibody detection of the residual release strand to give a robust helicase assay, that does not employ radiolabelled compounds and gives a stable read-out that is well suited to high-throughput screening. As proof of concept, the HCV helicase was expressed and isolated using recombinant protein techniques and then used in our assay. We found this assay to be highly reproducible since only slight variation was observed when a total of 96 helicase reactions (including controls) were performed on a single plate. Therefore, our suggested rapid helicase assay is fast, convenient and highly reproducible while obviating the need to employ radiochemicals. These criteria make it suitable for high throughput screening of potential helicase inhibitors. ### Reagents 1. Oligonucleotide 1 : - 5 ’-biotin-GCTGACCCTGCTCCCAATCGTAATCTATAGTGTCACCTA- 3 ’ - Oligonucleotide 2 : - 5 ’-DIG-CGATTGGGAGCAGGGTCAGC- 3 ’ - Purified helicase - Neutravidin – (Pierce Protein Research Products) - CSPD – luminescence kit (Pierce Protein Research Products) - 96 well plates ### Equipment 1. Incubator (Bioline shaking floor incubator) - Luminometer (luci II, Anthos Labtec) - PCR block ### Procedure 1) Setup the annealing reaction - Oligonucleotides 1 : 1 Molar - HEPES 2 mM - NaCl 0. 05 M - EDTA 0. 1 mM - SDS 0. 01 % (w/v) - Prepare for annealing by heating the oligonucleotide mix at 100 °C for 5 min. - Incubate at 65 °C for 30 min. - Incubate at 22 °C for 4 h to allow gradual annealing. - Store the annealed NS 3 helicase substrate at 20 °C ^ Critical step 2) Neutravidin Coating of the 96 -well plates Prepare a stock solution of neutravidin at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/ml in phosphate buffered saline (1 M PBS - pH 7. 0) Each of the 96 wells is coated overnight at 4 °C with 100 μl/well of a 5 μg/ml neutravidin solution in 0. 5 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 9. 3. Plates are then washed three times with 100 μl/well of PBS and air-dried at room temperature. 3) Blocking with BSA Wells are subsequently blocked upon addition of 100 μl of a 0. 1 % (w/v) BSA solution followed by incubation at 22 °C for 2 h. Plates are then washed three times with 200 μl/well of PBS, air-dried at room temperature and stored at 4 °C with desiccant. ^ Critical step 4) Substrate Application in the 96 -well plate For standard assays, mix 75 μl of 1 M phosphate buffer (PBS) pH 7. 0, containing 1 M NaCl with 2. 5 ng of the partially annealed DNA duplex for each well. Then incubate at 22 °C for 4 h. Finally, wash each well twice with 200 μl PBS and once with 200 μl of 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7. 5, 50 mM NaCl. All solutions should be pre-warmed to 37 °C. ^ Critical step 5) Helicase Reaction Helicase reactions are initiated upon addition of 90 μl of the reaction mix consisting of 11 nM of puriﬁed full-length HCV NS 3 protein, 25 mM 4 -morpholine-propanesulphonic acid (MOPS) pH 7. 0, 5 mM ATP, 2 mM DTT, 3 mM MnCl 2, and 100 μg/ml of BSA to the wells in which 2. 5 ng of DNA substrate has been previously applied. For negative controls, the reaction mix is lacking ATP. Reactions should be carried out for 60 min at 37 °C. Wells should then be washed twice with 200 μl of 150 mM NaCl and dried at room temperature for 15 min. 6) Activity determination – chemiluminescence preparation The wells of the multi-well plate are washed for 5 min with detection washing buffer (0. 1 M maleic acid, 0. 15 M NaCl, 0. 3 %, Tween 20, pH 7. 5). Then each well is filled up with blocking solution (10 % BSA (w/v) 0. 1 M maleic acid, 0. 15 M NaCl, pH 7. 5) for 30 min followed by a 30 min incubation in 20 μl Antibody solution (anti-Dig, Roche, 1 : 10, 000 solution of the antibody - 75 mU/ml- in Blocking solution). The wells are washed twice with 100 μl of detection buffer (0. 1 M Tris-HCl, 0. 1 M NaCl, pH 9. 5). Then 20 μl of detection buffer is applied for equilibration. 1 μl of chemiluminescence substrate (CSPD – 0. 25 mM) working solution is applied to each well and the plates are incubated for 5 min at 17 oC. The wells are then drained and incubated at 37 oC for 30 min to allow for any remaining solution to evaporate. The luminescence continues for approximately 48 hours with a constant-intensity phase lasting 24 hours. The remaining DIG label in each well of the 96 well-plate is counted for 10 min against controls (one of which lacks protein and the other lacks ATP) in a luminescence multi-well plate reader. ^ Critical step CRITICAL STEPS: - Step 1 : Choice of oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides used in this protocol are those described by Hicham Alaoui-Ismaili et al. (4), modified by DIG labelling of the release strand. Other sequences are possible but a 3 ’ single stranded region in the substrate appears to be required to initiate strand displacement (6). - Step 3 : During the blocking step it is important to ensure that all potential binding sites are occupied, to prevent direct binding of the detection antibody to the well in step 6. The wells should be filled with blocking solution to achieve <b>full</b> <b>coating</b> of the plate. - Step 4 : Pre-warming the solutions allows reactions to proceed at their optimum temperatures and avoids rate changes due to temperature equilibration. - Step 6 : Reaction wells should be completely filled up with blocking solution in order to ensure that the whole well has been blocked, thus preventing non-specific binding of any components of the detection system. ### Anticipated Results PROOF OF PRINCIPLE: Expression, purification and biochemical characterization of HCV helicase activity. The full-length HCV helicase coding region was incorporated into the pET 28 a vector (Novagen, Madison, WI, USA), carrying an N’ terminal 6 xHis-Tag region. The nucleotide sequence was veriﬁed prior to protein production. The HCV helicase gene was generously provided by Dr K. Klump, Roche laboratories in Palo Alto, USA. The helicase plasmid was transformed into the E. coli strain C 41 (DE 3 – plysS, Novagen). Cultures were grown in 750 ml LB medium, containing chloramphenicol 34 μg/ml and kanamycin 25 μg/ml. Protein production was induced at an attenuance (600 nm) of 0. 45 with 0. 5 mM IPTG. The culture was allowed to grow for 3 hours at 18 oC following induction. The cell pellet from 4 × 750 ml cultures was resuspended in 30 ml of 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7. 5, 300 mM NaCl, before the addition of lysozyme to 100 μg/ml and Triton X- 100 to a ﬁnal concentration of 0. 1 %. Following a 30 min incubation on ice, the suspension was sonicated four times for 20 s with 15 s intervals (Branson soniﬁer). Then it was centrifuged at 15, 000 × g for 20 min. Clariﬁed homogenates were adjusted to 10 mM imidazole (Sigma), ﬁltered through a 0. 45 μm membrane and loaded twice on a nickel afﬁnity column. After washing the column with ﬁve column volumes of buffer S (20 mM sodium phosphate pH 7. 4, 500 mM NaCl) containing 10 mM imidazole, NS 3 was eluted with buffer S containing 300 mM imidazole. To avoid precipitation, immediately after elution, the buffer in the helicase-containing fractions was exchanged for 25 mM Tris–HCl pH 7. 5, 0. 05 % CHAPS (3 -[(3 -cholamidopropyl) -dimethylammonio]- 1 -propane sulphonate), 20 % glycerol, 5 mM DTT (dithiothreitol). Buffer exchange was performed by dialysis. Protein concentration was evaluated using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as standard. Puriﬁed NS 3 protein was aliquoted and stored at 80 °C. This protein preparation was estimated to be greater than 85 % pure by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie blue staining. The puriﬁcation procedure yields approximately 1. 6 mg of HCV NS 3 per 3 litres of E. coli cultures (figure 1). **Figure 1 : bands** ![Fig 1]([URL] "Fig 1 ") *Figure 1. The SDS (left) and western blot (right, anti-His-tag antibody, qiagen penta-His conjugated) for the HCV helicase protein*. Chemiluminesence readings were taken using all different control combinations (presence/absence of helicase, DNA substrate and ATP) of the experiment in order to ensure the reliability of {{the measurement}}s (table 1). ![Table 1]([URL] "Table 1 ") It was demonstrated that the NS 3 -mediated unwinding is proportional to both the amount of DNA substrate in the well, and to the HCV helicase concentration in the reaction.
