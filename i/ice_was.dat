5|$|Heavy ice amounts {{fell for}} {{locations}} along Interstate 95 from Maine to Virginia and west towards southern Ohio and Indiana. <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> expected for {{parts of the}} Canadian Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> also {{transported by}} {{railroad}} from 1841 onwards, the {{first use of}} the technique being on the track laid down between Fresh Pond and Charleston by the Charlestown Branch Railroad Company. A special railroad car was built to insulate the ice and equipment designed to allow the cars to be loaded. In 1842 a new railroad to Fitchburg was used to access the ice at Walden Pond. <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> not a popular cargo with railway employees, however, as {{it had to be}} moved promptly to avoid melting and was generally awkward to transport. By the 1880s <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> being shipped by rail across the North American continent.|$|E
50|$|Old sea <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> sea <b>ice</b> {{that has}} survived {{at least one}} melting season (i.e. one summer). For this reason, this <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} thicker than first-year sea <b>ice.</b> Old <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> commonly divided into two types: second-year ice, which has survived one melting season, and multiyear ice, which has survived more than one. (In some sources, old <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> more than 2-years old.) Multi-year <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> much {{more common in the}} Arctic {{than it is in the}} Antarctic. The reason for this <b>is</b> that sea <b>ice</b> in the south drifts into warmer waters where it melts. In the Arctic, much of the sea <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> land-locked.|$|R
50|$|Because Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> mainly first-year <b>ice,</b> which <b>is</b> not {{as thick}} as multiyear <b>ice,</b> it <b>is</b> {{generally}} less than a few meters thick. Snowfall and flooding of the ice can thicken it substantially, and the layer structure of Antarctic <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> often quite complex.|$|R
5000|$|Amorphous ice (non-crystalline ("vitreous") <b>ice)</b> <b>is</b> an {{amorphous}} solid form of water. Common <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> a crystalline material where the molecules are regularly {{arranged in a}} hexagonal lattice whereas amorphous <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> distinguished {{by a lack of}} long-range order in its molecular arrangement. Amorphous <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> produced either by rapid cooling of liquid water (so the molecules do not have enough time to form a crystal lattice) or by compressing ordinary ice at low temperatures.|$|R
5|$|In August 8, 1988, <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> {{arrested in}} South Dallas for illegal drag racing.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2008, <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> {{arrested in}} Palm Beach County on a battery charge for {{allegedly}} kicking and hitting his wife. He was released {{the following day}} after she declared {{that her husband had}} only pushed her. In court, the couple's neighbor, Frank Morales, stated that it was merely a verbal argument. <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> ordered by a Florida court to stay away from his wife following his arrest, and to communicate with his children only if Morales accompanied him. The judge told Ice that he could only contact his wife via telephone. On April 29, 2008, Ice's lawyers, Bradford Cohen and Joseph LoRusso, were able to get the case dropped after providing the state attorney with evidence that conflicted with what was originally reported.|$|E
5|$|On August 30, 2016, Vanilla <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> {{announced}} {{as one of}} the celebrities who will compete on season 23 of Dancing with the Stars. He was partnered with professional dancer Witney Carson. They were eliminated on October 4, 2016.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ice</b> {{climbing}} <b>is</b> {{the activity}} of ascending inclined ice formations. Usually, ice climbing refers to roped and protected climbing of features such as icefalls, frozen waterfalls, and cliffs and rock slabs covered with ice refrozen from flows of water. For the purposes of climbing, <b>ice</b> can <b>be</b> broadly divided into two spheres, alpine ice and water <b>ice.</b> Alpine <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> found in a mountain environment, usually requires an approach to reach, and is often climbed {{in an attempt to}} summit a mountain. Water <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> usually found on a cliff or other outcropping beneath water flows. Alpine <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> frozen precipitation whereas water <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> a frozen liquid flow of water. Most alpine <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> generally one component of a longer route and often less technical, having more in common with standard glacier travel, while water <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> selected largely for its technical challenge. Technical grade is, however, independent of ice type and both types of ice vary greatly in consistency according to weather conditions. <b>Ice</b> can <b>be</b> soft, hard, brittle or tough. Mixed climbing is ascent involving both ice climbing and rock climbing.|$|R
50|$|Strictly <b>Ice</b> Dancing <b>was</b> {{identical}} to the ITV format Dancing on Ice, although details of Dancing on <b>Ice</b> <b>were</b> revealed before Strictly <b>Ice</b> Dancing <b>was</b> commissioned.|$|R
50|$|These {{three types}} occur also when ice forms {{on the surface}} of an {{aircraft}} when it flies through a cloud made of supercooled water liquid droplets. Rime <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> the least dense, milky <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> intermediate and clear <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> the most dense. All forms of ice can spoil lift and may have a catastrophic effect on an airborne aircraft. <b>Ice</b> <b>is</b> hazardous to flight as it disrupts airflow, increases weight, and adds drag. Ice forming on propellors and/or engine inlets can cause severe vibration and/or damage if ingested.|$|R
5|$|On January 1, 2017, Vanilla <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> {{invited by}} Insane Clown Posse and Psychopathic Records {{to take part}} in the free concert (September 16, 2017), the Juggalo March On Washington (September 17, 2017) as well as feature in the Family Psypher.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. was {{expanding}} westwards and, in Ohio, Hiram Joy {{began to}} exploit Crystal Lake, near Chicago, which was soon {{linked to the}} city by the Chicago, St Paul and Fond du Lac Railroad company. The <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> used to allow goods {{to be brought to}} market. Cincinnati and Chicago began to use ice to help the packing of pork in the summer, John L. Schooley developing the first refrigerated packing room. Fruit began to be stored in the central Illinois using refrigerators, for consumption in later seasons. By the 1860s, <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> being used to allow the brewing of the increasingly popular lager beer all year round. Improved railroad links helped the growth in business across the region and to the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{expedition}} {{arrived at}} its final destination of Libreville on 21 March, after twenty-seven days. The block of <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> found to weigh 2,714kg; it had lost only 336kg along the way. Though {{it was unclear}} how much time the expedition would take, Klevan had initially estimated a loss of 10%; the end result was approximately 11%. A French representative of the company met the crew in Libreville. A personal friend of President Charles de Gaulle, he presented an offer to drive the ice back to Paris. If the crew accepted, the President himself would have received the crew under the Arc de Triomphe. The men, however, were too exhausted at that point to contemplate such an offer. Instead, arrangement were made for the vehicles to be brought back by freight, while the crew would fly home. The <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> cut up and divided between the citizens of Libreville, for whom this was a rare commodity. Klevan, always conscious of promotional opportunities, brought {{a portion of the}} ice back home with him. This <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> subsequently used in drinks served to journalists at the première of the expedition documentary back home in Oslo.|$|E
50|$|In winter, ice {{fishing for}} trout is permitted. The {{thickness}} of the <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> not monitored, but {{should be at least}} 4 in thick before venturing out on it. <b>Ice</b> skating <b>is</b> allowed when the <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> thick enough, but limited to the beach area.|$|R
50|$|In {{most cases}} of {{biosynthesis}} and chemosynthesis, flake <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> {{used to control}} the reaction rate and maintain the liveness. Flake <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> sanitary, clean with rapid temperature reduction effect.|$|R
50|$|There is {{evidence}} that meltwater discharges are episodic. This can result because as water continues to collect, more <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> lifted, and the water moves outward in a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> most easily lifted (i.e., areas with thinner overlying <b>ice</b> sheets) <b>are</b> lifted first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice. As water collects, additional <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> lifted until a release path is created.|$|R
5|$|The final part of {{the supply}} chain for {{domestic}} and smaller commercial customers involved the delivery of ice, typically using an ice wagon. In the U.S., <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> cut into 25-, 50- and 100-pound blocks (11, 23 and 45kg) then distributed by horse-drawn ice wagons. An iceman, driving the cart, would then deliver the ice to the household, using ice tongs to hold the cubes. Deliveries could occur either daily or twice daily. By the 1870s, various specialist distributors existed in the major cities, with local fuel dealers or other businesses selling and delivering ice in the smaller communities. In Britain, <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> rarely sold to domestic customers via specialist dealers during the 19th century, instead usually being sold through fishmongers, butchers and chemists, who kept ice on their premises for their own commercial use.|$|E
5|$|The {{understanding}} of thermodynamics was limited {{at the start}} of the 19th century, when it was believed that the key to the successful storage to <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> the construction of underground ice houses, where it was believed, incorrectly, that it would always be cool enough to store ice successfully. European ice houses were based on this theory, and used underground chambers, often built at considerable expense, to store the winter harvest. Some farmers in Virginia, however, had developed much cheaper icehouses, elevated off the ground, built from wood and insulated with hay. In addition to the temperature that <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> held at, there was also a need to efficiently drain off the melted water, as this water would further melt the remaining ice much faster than warm air would do.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{manufacture}} of artificial plant <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> still negligible in 1880, it began to grow in volume {{towards the end of}} the century as technological improvements finally allowed the production of plant ice at a competitive price. Typically ice plants first took hold in more distant locations where natural <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> at a cost disadvantage. The Australian and Indian markets were already dominated by plant ice, and ice plants began to be built in Brazil during the 1880s and 1890s, slowly coming to replace imported ice. In the U.S., plants began to become more numerous in the southern states. The long distance transportation companies continued to use cheap natural ice for the bulk of their refrigeration needs, but they now used purchased local plant ice at key points across the US, to allow for surge demand and to avoid the need to hold reserve stocks of natural ice. After 1898 the British fishing industry too began to turn to plant ice to refrigerate its catches.|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} {{modes of}} polycrystalline <b>ice</b> <b>are</b> reviewed. Whereas single crystals of ice deform easily by shear on the basal plane, the minimum creep rate of polycrystalline <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> largely controlled by processes occurring on non-basal planes. Three main models describing the transient behaviour of polycrystalline <b>ice</b> <b>are</b> presented and discussed. Evidence that {{the occurrence of}} the first cracks, in the ductile-brittle transition, is related to a critical delayed elastic strain is presented. The mechanical behaviour of damaged <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> discussed. It is shown that damage enhances the creep rate notably. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} the thermo-elastic {{behaviour}} of saline <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> formulated, and model solutions describing thermo-elastic waves propagating into a half-space of the <b>ice</b> <b>are</b> investigated. The model {{is based on a}} proposal that saline <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> a matrix which encompasses both closed brine pockets and permeable channels filled with brine. Experiments on the thermal expansion of saline ice samples, and on thermo-elastic waves in saline <b>ice,</b> have <b>been</b> performed in the cold laboratories of the University Centre in Svalbard and in University College London. The experimental data are compared with theoretical conclusions. The experimental data support our hypothesis that the brine in saline <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> divided between closed pockets and open, permeable channels...|$|R
25|$|Introduced in 2003, <b>ICE</b> <b>is</b> {{available}} on all new aircraft and features between 600 and 1200 channels to all passengers. <b>ICE</b> <b>is</b> {{found on the}} airline’s Airbus A380-800, Boeing 777-200LR, Boeing 777-300 and Boeing 777-300ER.|$|R
5|$|Danish workers {{involved}} in the clean-up operation claimed long-term health problems resulted from their exposure to the radiation. Although they did not work at Camp Hunziker, the Danes worked at the Tank Farm where the contaminated <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> collected, in the port where the contaminated debris was shipped from, and they also serviced the vehicles used in the clean-up. It {{is also possible that}} they were exposed to radiation in the local atmosphere. Many of the workers surveyed in the years following Project Crested Ice reported health problems. A 1995 survey found 410 deaths by cancers out of a sample of 1,500 workers.|$|E
5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the <b>ice</b> <b>was</b> first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> {{laid on the}} on 12 November 1992 and {{the arena}} was officially {{completed}} on 1 December. The opening show took place already on 25 November and the first official match, between Storhamar and Stjernen, took place on 8 December. The venue was the 26th indoor ice hockey arena in Norway. After the Olympic arena was built, Storhamar Ishall was renovated, and the spectator capacity reduced {{through the construction of}} storage facilities and VIP areas. The Olympic Amphitheatre later installed Norway's first media cube in 2004.|$|E
50|$|If meltwater accumulates, the {{discharges}} are episodic under continental ice sheets as well {{as under}} Alpine glaciers. The discharge results when water collects, the overlying <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> lifted, and the water moves outward in a pressurized layer or a growing under-ice lake. Areas where the <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> most easily lifted (i.e. areas with thinner overlying <b>ice</b> sheets) <b>are</b> lifted first. Hence the water may move up the terrain underlying the glacier if it moves toward areas of lower overlying ice. As water collects, additional <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> lifted until a release path is created.|$|R
50|$|Congelation <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> <b>ice</b> {{that forms}} {{on the bottom}} of an {{established}} ice cover.|$|R
50|$|<b>Ices</b> <b>is</b> {{the third}} studio album by American singer Lia <b>Ices.</b> It <b>was</b> {{released}} in September 2014 under Jagjaguwar Records.|$|R
5|$|In February 2015, <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> {{arrested and}} charged with {{burglary}} residence and grand theft after he allegedly stole furniture, a pool heater, bicycles and other items from a Florida home he believed to be vacant. He later accepted a plea deal which would result in the charges being dropped following his completion of 100 hours of community service and payment of restitution to the estate of the homeowner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} new {{insights}} into the nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water <b>ice,</b> <b>was</b> later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed {{for the first time that}} the occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E
5|$|On 18 August 2008, Columbia Records {{announced}} 18 October Australian release, and 20 October worldwide release, of {{the studio}} album Black Ice. The 15-track album was the band's first studio release in eight years, was produced by Brendan O'Brien and was mixed and engineered by Mike Fraser. Like Stiff Upper Lip, it was recorded at The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia. Black <b>Ice</b> <b>was</b> sold in the US exclusively at Walmart and Sam's Club and the band's official website.|$|E
50|$|Antarctic sea <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> the sea <b>ice</b> of the Southern Ocean. It extends {{far north}} {{in winter and}} retreats almost to the {{coastline}} each summer. Sea <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> frozen seawater that is usually less than a few meters thick. This {{is in contrast to}} <b>ice</b> shelves, which <b>are</b> formed by glaciers, float in the sea, and are up to a kilometer thick. There are two subdivisions of sea ice: fast <b>ice,</b> which <b>is</b> attached to land; and <b>ice</b> floes, which <b>are</b> not.|$|R
5000|$|A frost flower {{is formed}} when thin layers of <b>ice</b> <b>are</b> {{extruded}} from long-stemmed plants in autumn or early winter. The thin layers of <b>ice</b> <b>are</b> often formed into exquisite patterns that curl into [...] "petals" [...] that resemble flowers.|$|R
50|$|Synthetic <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> a solid polymer {{material}} {{designed for}} skating using normal metal-bladed <b>ice</b> skates. Rinks <b>are</b> constructed by interlocking panels. Synthetic <b>ice</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called artificial ice, but that term is ambiguous, {{as it is}} also used to mean the mechanically frozen skating surface created by freezing water with refrigeration equipment.|$|R
