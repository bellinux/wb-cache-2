5|$|Argon is {{produced}} industrially by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Argon is mostly {{used as an}} inert shielding gas in welding and other high-temperature industrial processes where ordinarily unreactive substances become reactive; for example, an argon atmosphere is used in graphite electric furnaces to prevent the graphite from burning. Argon is also used in incandescent, <b>fluorescent</b> lighting, and other gas-discharge tubes. Argon makes a distinctive blue-green gas laser. Argon is also used in <b>fluorescent</b> glow starters.|$|E
5|$|Barium {{oxide coating}} on the {{electrodes}} of <b>fluorescent</b> lamps facilitates {{the release of}} electrons.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium {{production}} saw a {{rapid increase}} during World War II, {{due to the}} rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for <b>fluorescent</b> lights. Most early <b>fluorescent</b> lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum to yield an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium {{was found to be}} toxic.|$|E

5|$|The {{puzzle of}} how {{embryonic}} development was controlled {{began to be}} solved using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism. The step-by-step control of its embryogenesis was visualized by attaching <b>fluorescent</b> dyes of different colours to specific types of protein made by genes expressed in the embryo. A dye such as green <b>fluorescent</b> protein, originally from a jellyfish, was typically attached to an antibody specific to a fruit fly protein, forming a precise indicator of where and when that protein appeared in the living embryo.|$|E

5|$|Electrical {{measurements}} do {{not provide}} an actual picture like imaging with a microscope can. Lipid bilayers cannot {{be seen in a}} traditional microscope because they are too thin. In order to see bilayers, researchers often use fluorescence microscopy. A sample is excited with one wavelength of light and observed in a different wavelength, so that only <b>fluorescent</b> molecules with a matching excitation and emission profile will be seen. Natural lipid bilayers are not <b>fluorescent,</b> so a dye is used that attaches to the desired molecules in the bilayer. Resolution is usually limited to a few hundred nanometers, much smaller than a typical cell but much larger than the thickness of a lipid bilayer.|$|E
5|$|Glow {{discharge}} plasmas: non-thermal plasmas {{generated by}} the application of DC or low frequency RF (<100 kHz) electric field to the gap between two metal electrodes. Probably the most common plasma; {{this is the type}} of plasma generated within <b>fluorescent</b> light tubes.|$|E
5|$|Labeling and {{inhibition}} of the proteasome is also {{of interest in}} laboratory settings for both in vitro and in vivo study of proteasomal activity in cells. The most commonly used laboratory inhibitors are lactacystin and the peptide aldehyde MG132 initially developed by Goldberg lab. <b>Fluorescent</b> inhibitors have also been developed to specifically label the active sites of the assembled proteasome.|$|E
2500|$|The punk {{movement}} {{that emerged in}} the late 1970s aimed to provoke rather than follow the trends of the day.

Black, <b>fluorescents,</b> and neo-tribalism were major aesthetic elements.|$|R
50|$|As of 2009, the Paramount {{has a new}} {{sign out}} front. The 1940s Paramount sign {{originally}} used 1,970 incandescent bulbs, which were eventually replaced by 11-watt <b>fluorescents.</b> The new sign is {{a replica of the}} original iconic sign, but uses LED lights. The Paramount Theatre was also used to hold auditions for the sixth season of America's Got Talent.|$|R
50|$|Another {{light source}} in reef aquariums today is metal halide lighting. These high output lights closely {{recreate}} the shimmering effect of bright tropical sun over {{a patch of}} coral reef. Metal halide bulbs {{come in a variety}} of spectra from 5000k on up to 20,000k and allow for a variety of light-hungry corals to survive under them. Many aquarists will use metal halide bulbs in conjunction with either power compact <b>fluorescents</b> or T5 <b>fluorescents</b> since halide lighting does not have the overall balanced effect of other light types. While very useful to reef aquarium keepers, halide lighting also uses a lot of electricity (150-400 watts being common) and produces copious amounts of heat. Most reef keepers mount halide bulbs at least one foot above their tank and some, due to the lights' heat output have had to add chillers to keep aquarium water cool.|$|R
5|$|Moreover, {{in living}} cells, the storage {{can be turned}} active by enzymes. Light-gated protein domains fused to DNA {{processing}} enzymes are suitable for that task in vitro. <b>Fluorescent</b> exonucleases can transmit the output according to the nucleotide they have read.|$|E
5|$|Other {{companies}} {{followed with}} their own bubble light versions and other lighting novelties. In 1946, Sylvania introduced <b>fluorescent</b> pastel lights. In 1955, NOMA manufactured flashing lights. In 1958, GE launched Lighted Ice Bulbs, blue bulbs covered with 'ice' crystals. Fairy Lights were imported from Europe in 1950 and eventually morphed into the inexpensive mini-lights popular in the last decades of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Post-crash {{analysis}} of the crack surfaces showed {{the presence of a}} penetrating <b>fluorescent</b> dye used to detect cracks during maintenance. The presence of the dye indicated that the crack was present and should have been detected at a prior inspection. The detection failure arose from poor attention to human factors in United Airlines' specification of maintenance processes.|$|E
50|$|CFL bulbs have {{revolutionized}} lighting to {{its most}} energy-efficient form. These miniature versions of full-sized <b>fluorescents</b> emit more light with less power; they use approximately one-third {{the energy of}} the average incandescent light bulb. Installation is no different from the average light bulb. They screw into the standard light socket to give off light similar to any average light bulb.|$|R
40|$|Because of {{the energy}} crisis and the low {{proportion}} of new buildings in Taiwan, rational use of electricity in existing buildings becomes very important for reducing carbon emissions and combating global climate change. The retrofitting of lighting systems {{is one of the}} most widely adopted energy saving measures. This study presents the potential energy saving and payback period of lighting system retrofit through replacing low performance T 8 <b>fluorescents</b> with T 5 <b>fluorescents</b> and LED indicator lights in the Green Building Renovation Plan. Based on the analysis, this study concludes that lighting system retrofit can achieve significant energy saving ratios of 10 - 17. 5 % in daily use. However, the average payback periods of GBRP investment and normal purchase investment are ten years and 7. 82 years, respectively. Both exceed the average lifetime of lighting equipment, suggesting that lighting system retrofit is slightly uneconomical because of the low electricity tariff in Taiwan...|$|R
40|$|Effect of Pseudomonas fluorescens P 60 on {{pathological}} {{and physiological}} quality {{and growth of}} rice IR 64   seedlings. The research objectives were (1) detection and identification of seed-borne pathogens of IR 64 rice, (2) testing Pseudomonas <b>fluorescents</b> P 60 in inhibiting the in vitro growth of seed-borne pathogens colonies, (3) testing P. <b>fluorescents</b> P 60 for pathological and physiological seed quality, and (4) testing P. <b>fluorescents</b> P 60 on the growth of seedlings in the greenhouse. The results showed that some seed-borne pathogens can be found both on farmers’ IR 64 rice and factory’s; they were Aspergillus flavus, Alternaria padwickii, Pseudomonas glumae, and P. syringae. Application of P. flourescens P 60 was able to inhibit the in vitrogrowth of colonies of all seed-borne pathogens, except P. syringae.   Related to pathological quality, the effect of P. flourescens P 60 on percentage of seed-borne pathogens attack did {{not significantly different from}} that of benomil but smaller than distilled water. On the physiological quality of seeds, treatment of P. flourescens P 60 has the same effect with benomil and distilled water, with  germination rate was more than 80 %.

50|$|Incandescent versus Compact Fluorescent-Incandescents pass {{electricity}} {{through a}} small filament (wire) causing it to glow hot and produce lumens (light). Up to 90 percent of the energy used in this process is for heat, not light, production. This wasted energy is far offset by Compact <b>Fluorescents</b> as they process lumens through a gas charged tube; electricity passes through the tube to create a chemical reaction that yields light. This cooler source focuses almost all its energy on light production, itself.|$|R
