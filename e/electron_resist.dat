The inductively coupled plasma reactive-ion etching technique is found to be very promising, however, more work need to be put into finding the right <b>electron</b> <b>resist</b> for the process. The resist used in this thesis, 950 PMMA A 2, proved to etch away too fast in the dry etching plasma. Using an aluminium hard mask in replacement for the <b>electron</b> <b>resist</b> mask was also investigated. The results were promising, but the aluminium mask should have been kept as thin as possible...|$|E
40|$|A {{process method}} that will produce ion milled bridges and {{trenches}} of ultra small dimensions in YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 (YBCO) thin films is presented. The method {{is based on}} electron beam lithography, reactive ion etching (RIE), ion milling and a multilayer mask, which consists of an <b>electron</b> <b>resist</b> and an amorphous carbon layer with intermediate niobium. Carbon has two unique properties {{that are used in}} the process. First, carbon can easily be reactive ion etched in an oxygen atmosphere, since the oxides of carbon are gases. Furthermore, carbon has an extremely low ion milling etching rate. The <b>electron</b> <b>resist</b> pattern is transferred to the niobium and the carbon layers by a reactive ion etching process with CF 4 and O 2 In such a way a durable carbon mask for ion milling is formed. When the ion milling is completed, the result of the process is 50 - 60 nm wide bridges and 30 - 60 nm wide trenches in 100 nm thick YBCO films...|$|E

40|$|Contrast in {{positive}} <b>electron</b> <b>resist</b> NPR can be en-hanced by introducing a surface-modified layer.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} nanostructure fabrication techniques {{based on}} electron beam lithography, {{which is the}} most widely employed nanofabrication techniques for R&D and for the prototyping or production of photo-mask or imprint mold. The focus is on the study of novel resist and development process, as well as pattern transfer procedure after lithography. Specifically, this thesis investigates the following topics that are related to either <b>electron</b> beam <b>resists,</b> their development, or pattern transfer process after electron beam lithography: (1) The dry thermal development (contrary to conventional solvent development) of negative <b>electron</b> beam <b>resists</b> polystyrene (PS) to achieve reasonably high contrast and resolution.

Au was deposited by physical vapor deposition to fabricate the Au nano-electrodes and the Au nanofilm in the pattern which was prepared by electron beam lithography.

30|$|Modification of the {{conjugate}} SAMs by {{electron beam}} allows fabrication of the crosslinked aromatic SAM [8, 9]. Low-energy electrons {{are necessary to}} create a crosslinked molecular network. The basic means to form molecular crosslinking is cleavage of the CH bond by {{the impact of the}} electrons on the molecular backbone. This phenomenon, for low-energy electrons, dissociative electron attachment (DEA), is generated by the attachment of electrons on the Rydberg states of the molecules, depending on the characteristics of the excitation states in which the electrons are located. This excitation can result in one of two dynamics: (i) simple electron relaxation or (ii) bond rupture that engenders crosslinking phenomena. Modern high-energy electron beam lithography allows the crosslinking of the aromatic molecules and the fabrication of sheets of nanometer size, which also provides evidence that the aromatic self-assembled monolayer acts as a negative <b>electron</b> <b>resist</b> with a high-energy electron beam [8, 9].|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The surface {{attachment}} {{properties of}} the Creutz-Taube ion, i. e., [(NH 3) 5 Ru(pyrazine) Ru(NH 3) 5] 5 +, on both hydrophilic and hydrophobic types of surfaces were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The {{results indicated that the}} Creutz-Taube ions only bound to hydrophilic surfaces, such as SiO 2 and –OH terminated organic SAMs on gold substrates. No attachment of the ions on hydrophobic surfaces such as –CH 3 terminated organic SAMs and poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) thin films covered gold or SiO 2 substrates was observed. Further ellipsometric, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and time-dependent XPS studies suggested that the attached cations could form an inorganic analog of the self-assembled monolayer on SiO 2 substrate with a “lying-down ” orientation. The strong electrostatic interaction between the highly charged cations and the anionic SiO 2 surface was believed to account for these observations. Based on its selective binding property, patterning of wide (~ 200 nm) and narrow (~ 35 nm) lines of the Creutz-Taube ions on SiO 2 surface were demonstrated through PMMA <b>electron</b> <b>resist</b> masks written by electron beam lithography (EBL) ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAromatic self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) {{can be used}} as {{negative}} tone <b>electron</b> <b>resists</b> in functional surface lithographic fabrication. A dense and resistant molecular network is obtained under electron irradiation through the formation of a cross-linked network. The elementary processes and possible mechanisms involved were investigated through the response of a model aromatic SAM, p-terphenylthiol SAM, to low-energy electron (0 - 10 eV) irradiation. Energy loss spectra as well as vibrational excitation functions were measured using High Resolution Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (HREELS). A resonant electron attachment process was identified around 6 eV through associated enhanced excitation probability of the CH stretching modes ν(CH) (ph) at 378 meV. Electron irradiation at 6 eV was observed to induce a peak around 367 meV in the energy loss spectra, attributed to the formation of sp(3) -hybridized CHx groups within the SAM. This partial loss of aromaticity is interpreted {{to be the result of}} resonance formation, which relaxes by reorganization and/or CH bond dissociation mechanisms followed by radical chain reactions. These processes may also account for cross-linking induced by electron irradiation of aromatic SAMs in general...|$|R

25|$|The {{process of}} {{electron}} penetration through a resist {{is essentially a}} stochastic process; there is a finite probability that resist exposure by released electrons can occur quite far {{from the point of}} photon absorption. Increasing the dose increases the number of far-reaching electrons, resulting in more extended resist loss. A leading EUV chemically amplified resist exposed to 80 eV electrons at a dose up to 80 uc/cm2 showed up to 7.5 nm resist thickness loss. For an open-source resist exposed near 200 uC/cm2 by 80 eV <b>electrons,</b> the <b>resist</b> thickness lost after post-exposure bake and development was around 13nm, while doubling the dose resulted in increasing the loss to 15nm.

Their NPs consisted of a polymer with a relatively low refractive index. In contrast, our Si NPs can exhibit Mie-like resonance in visible and near-infrared wavelength ranges because of the large refractive index of Si (see Fig.  4 a, b). Therefore, both the plasmonic effects in the metal layers and the geometric resonance in the Si NPs should be considered to explain the optical properties of our metal-coated Si NP arrays.|$|R
