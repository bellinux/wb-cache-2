5|$|Heian {{culture and}} court life reached a peak {{early in the}} 11th century. The {{population}} of Kyoto grew to around 100,000 as the nobility became increasingly isolated at the Heian Palace in government posts and court service. Courtiers became overly refined with little to do, insulated from reality, preoccupied with the minutiae of court life, turning to artistic endeavors. Emotions were commonly expressed through the artistic use of textiles, fragrances, calligraphy, colored paper, poetry, and layering of clothing in pleasing color combinations—according to mood and season. Those who showed an inability to <b>follow</b> <b>conventional</b> aesthetics quickly lost popularity, particularly at court. Popular pastimes for Heian noblewomen—who adhered to rigid fashions of floor-length hair, whitened skin and blackened teeth—included having love affairs, writing poetry and keeping diaries. The literature that Heian court women wrote is recognized {{as some of the}} earliest and among the best literature written in the Japanese canon.|$|E
25|$|Gömbös {{advocated}} {{a number of}} social reforms, one-party government, revision of the Treaty of Trianon, and Hungary's withdrawal from the League of Nations. Although he assembled a strong political machine, his efforts to achieve his vision and reforms were frustrated by a parliament composed mostly of István Bethlen's supporters and by Hungary's creditors, who forced Gömbös to <b>follow</b> <b>conventional</b> policies {{in dealing with the}} economic and financial crisis. The result of the 1935 elections gave Gömbös more solid support in parliament. He succeeded in gaining control of the ministries of finance, industry, and defense and in replacing several key military officers with his supporters. In October 1936, he died due to kidney problems without realizing his goals.|$|E

The studio also invites employees who are not involved in game design, such as artists and programmers, to provide creative input to their projects.

While the company developed an expertise in action games, Saito claimed that the studio learned from every project and will apply this knowledge to their new games and genres.

500|$|Maxwell {{bought the}} Mirror Group in 1986 and floated it in May 1991, {{appointing}} Clark {{to the board}} of directors. Maxwell claimed that the offer he made Clark would appeal to even a [...] "one-eyed Bulgarian peasant". Clark claimed that he tried to make Maxwell <b>follow</b> <b>conventional</b> business practices and remained convinced that [...] "until quite close to the end, he never did anything I asked him not to do". It was only after Maxwell's unusual death on 5 November 1991 that financial mismanagement of the Mirror Group came to light. There was evidence of 29 unusual payments of £230 million from Mirror to other Maxwell companies within one year in a fraud that eventually cost the company, and its pension fund, £492 million. Clark claimed that there had been no evidence for the directors to act on against Maxwell, telling the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM) that [...] "No system of internal control, however elaborate, can stop fraudulent collusion by a group of individuals holding authority and trust. None of us [...] would have taken on the job had we thought Maxwell was a crook. How many can stand up and say: 'We said he was a crook a year ago'?" [...] Clark's position was disputed by the Department of Trade and Industry, which determined that the two non-executive directors, Clark and Alan Clements, should have questioned the payments. At the EGM Clark almost lost his usual polite nature when he was accused of being a Maxwell [...] "crony" [...] by Rupert Allason and had to rule a no-confidence vote as out of order.|$|E

Some studies suggest that auditory weakness is only present for explicit memory (direct recall), rather than implicit memory.

Within auditory stimuli, semantic analysis produces {{the highest levels of}} recall ability for stimuli. Experiments suggest that levels-of-processing on the auditory level is directly correlated with neural activation.|$|E

50|$|Most of Vijayan's {{publications}} are compilations of his speeches. He {{is considered}} to be a powerful orator.

Sreejan criticizes Vijayan's style, arguing that it is densely figurative, hence vague and often meaningless. Vijayan was a pioneer of the use of psychological criticism in Malayalam literature, and influenced contemporary Kerala culture.|$|E

Enger states that pancake sentences are [...] "where the predicative adjective apparently disagrees with its subject".

The various styles are seen at their most fully developed in the cathedrals, abbey churches and collegiate buildings.

Swarup Sarkar, a spokesperson of SIFF, has said that men with low incomes are rarely targeted and most victims of misuse are well-off. He has claimed that these laws assume that women are always truthful, and don't place much importance on evidence. He has termed misuse of these laws, legal terrorism.|$|E

50|$|Ironically, Saunders-Roe had {{not been}} one of the {{companies}} who received the Specification; this is likely due to the Ministry of Supply not considering them to be relevant, as the firm had typically been involved in the production of flying boats. However, Saunders-Roe was in fact interested in the new requirement, having been already independently conducting studies into high-altitude and high-speed flight. Maurice Brennan, the company's chief designer, had already directed members of the design team to study the prospects of rocket-propelled aircraft capable of flying at altitudes of up to 100000 ft and had published a reported entitled 'Investigation of Problems of Pure Rocket Fighter Aircraft' {{at the same time that}} the Ministry had issued Specification F124T.

5000|$|The series Untitled Film Stills (1977-1980), {{with which}} Cindy Sherman {{achieved}} international recognition, consists of 69 black-and-white photographs. The artist poses in different roles (librarians, hillbillies, and seductresses), and settings (streets, yards, pools, beaches, and interiors), producing a result reminiscent of stills typical of Italian neorealism or American film noir of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. She avoided putting titles on the images {{to preserve their}} ambiguity. She would often pose her heroines as alone, expressionless, and in private. An overarching characteristic of her heroines were those that did not <b>follow</b> <b>conventional</b> ideas of marriage and family. They were rebellious women who either died as that or who were later tamed by society. Modest in scale compared to Sherman’s later cibachrome photographs, they are all 8 1/2 by 11 inches, each displayed in identical, simple black frames. Sherman used her own possessions as props, or sometimes borrowed, as in Untitled Film Still #11 in which the doggy pillow belongs to a friend. The shots were also largely taken in her own apartment.The Untitled Film Stills fall into several distinct groups: ...|$|E
