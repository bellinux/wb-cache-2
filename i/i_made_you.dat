500|$|Megan Fox was {{originally}} {{attached to the}} film, and Patrick Dempsey's role as Dylan Gould {{was to be the}} employer of Fox's character, Mikaela Banes. According to various published sources, Fox's absence from the film was due to Bay ultimately choosing not to renew her role in light of her comparing him and his work ethics to Adolf Hitler, although representatives for the actress said that it was her decision to leave the film franchise. Bay later claimed that Fox was fired by executive producer Steven Spielberg, a claim which Spielberg denied. [...] "I wasn't hurt", Bay stated, [...] "because I know that's just Megan. Megan loves to get a response. And she does it in kind of the wrong way. I'm sorry, Megan. I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> work twelve hours. I'm sorry that I'm making you show up on time. Movies are not always warm and fuzzy." ...|$|E
500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that I believe I know more of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow: Rightful {{captain of}} the Black Pearl, Jack fell victim of mutiny from his crew under the {{direction}} of his first-mate Hector Barbossa. Left for dead, marooned on a deserted island, Sparrow is back in search of his ship and those who betrayed him. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name [...] "Jack Sparrow"; however, he was not well known outside his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, [...] "a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate." [...] At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards, who would later appear as Jack's father in [...] Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, [...] "He's ruining the film!" [...] Depp answered back, [...] "Look, these are the choices <b>I</b> <b>made.</b> <b>You</b> know my work. So either trust me or give me the boot." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{friend of}} Peniston {{had brought the}} article to her {{attention}} later, and she responded to Monica via the social networking website MySpace.com, saying {{that she did not}} recall the event but wanted to apologize for it, saying she had always encouraged and supported children and speculating that she may have been distracted by her staff at the time. Peniston said [...] "At that time I was young and still pretty new to the industry myself, and so I hadn't learned how to balance everything just yet. It really hurts me that <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> feel like that." [...] Monica thanked her for the apology, and for caring [...] "after all the years have passed".|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophy}} of parkour {{has been compared}} to that of martial arts. In an interview with The New Yorker, David Belle acknowledges the influence: [...] "There's a quote by Bruce Lee that's my motto: 'There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. A man must constantly exceed his level.' If you're not better than you were the day before, then what are you doing—what's the point?". In an interview with the press, Belle explained that parkour is a training method for warriors. [...] "So many people try to train easy 'Come do parkour! It's really cool!' But if tomorrow <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> do real training, you would end up crying. That's what you need to know: you are going to cry, you are going to bleed {{and you are going to}} sweat like never before." [...] In his book, Belle also quotes his father Raymond: [...] "If two roads open up before you, always take the most difficult one. Because you know you can travel the easy one." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1945, {{his mother}} Martha married British army major Kenneth Stoppard, {{who gave the}} boys his English surname and, in 1946, after the war, moved the family to England. His {{stepfather}} believed strongly that [...] "to be born an Englishman was to have drawn first prize in the lottery of life"– a quote from Cecil Rhodes– telling his small stepson: [...] "Don't you realise that <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> British?" [...] setting up Stoppard's desire as a child to become [...] "an honorary Englishman". [...] "I fairly often find I'm with people who forget I don't quite belong in the world we're in", he says. [...] "I find I put a foot wrong– it could be pronunciation, an arcane bit of English history– and suddenly I'm there naked, as someone with a pass, a press ticket." [...] This is reflected in his characters, he notes, who are [...] "constantly being addressed by the wrong name, with jokes and false trails {{to do with the}} confusion of having two names". Stoppard attended the Dolphin School in Nottinghamshire, and later completed his education at Pocklington School in East Riding, Yorkshire, which he hated.|$|E

2500|$|Bernhardt had a {{remarkable}} ability to memorize a role quickly. She recounted in L'Art du Théâtre that [...] "I {{only have to}} read a role {{two or three times}} and I know it completely; but the day that I stop playing the piece the role escapes me entirely... My memory can't contain several parts at the same time, and it's impossible for me to recite off-hand a tirade from Phèdre or Hamlet. And yet I can remember the smallest events from my childhood." [...] She also suffered, particularly early in her career, bouts of memory loss and stage fright. Once, she was seriously ill before a performance of L'Etrangére at the Gaiety Theater in London, and the doctor gave her a dose of painkiller, either opium or morphine. During the performance, she went on stage, but could not remember what she was supposed to say. She turned to another actress, and announced, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>made</b> <b>you</b> come here, Madame, it is because I wanted to instruct you in what I want done... I have thought about it, and I do not want to tell you today", then walked offstage. The other actors, astonished, quickly improvised an ending to the scene. After a brief rest, her memory came back, and Bernhardt went back on stage, and completed the play.|$|E
