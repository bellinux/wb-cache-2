5|$|Balzac revised obsessively, {{covering}} printer's proofs {{with changes}} and additions to be reset. He sometimes repeated this process during {{the publication of}} a book, causing significant expense both <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> the publisher.

Although some of his books never reached completion, some — such as Les employés (The Government Clerks, 1841) — are nonetheless noted by critics.|$|E

Michael was, nevertheless, willing to acknowledge Habsburg overlordship.|$|E

5|$|A short interregnum followed, {{during which}} {{ownership}} {{was transferred to}} J.W. Skaggs. Skaggs continued to push Alexander's Democratic Party/states' rights agenda during his short five weeks at the helm. The poor economics of the weekly paper were unchanged, however, and Skaggs immediately moved to unload his newly acquired white elephant. He cut his losses and avoided the stigma of financial failure <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> the conservative political movement by giving away the paper outright to two men who worked for him as printers, William Thompson and William Victor. According to Thompson's later recollection, Skaggs sweetened the transfer of ownership by tossing in two bundles of paper and two cords of firewood for the new owners.|$|E
5|$|After two weeks, {{when the}} {{dealership}} had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In {{a letter to}} the editor of The New York Times, he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity <b>for</b> <b>himself,</b> <b>and</b> stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to September Morn status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in American Heritage, attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.|$|E

It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed to buy <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E

Experts said some of the animals would require special care {{for the rest of their}} lives. During the administration of his bankruptcy case, the U.S. Department of Labor complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies that Vick held in trust <b>for</b> <b>himself</b> <b>and</b> eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owned.|$|E
