Following Labour's {{victory in the}} election, Howard stood down as Conservative leader, with Johnson backing David Cameron as his successor. After being successfully selected, Cameron appointed Johnson as the shadow <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>minister,</b> acknowledging his popularity among students. Johnson's main interest was in streamlining university funding, as part of which he supported Labour's proposed top-up fees. In September 2006, his image was used in 'Boris needs you' and 'I Love Boris' material to promote the Conservative Party's image during Freshers' Week in universities. In 2006, Johnson campaigned to become the Rector of the University of Edinburgh, but his support for top-up fees damaged his campaign and he ultimately came third, losing to Mark Ballard.|$|E

500|$|On 20 February 2011, {{following}} {{the publication of}} Saldanha's and Somasekhara's contradictory reports on the attacks on churches, more than 100,000 Christians representing some 45 Christian denominations and secular organisations gathered in Mangalore to protest. Present was Bishop Aloysius Paul D'Souza of Mangalore Diocese, Bishop Emeritus C. L. Furtado and Bishop John S. Sadananda of the CSI Karnataka Southern Diocese, AICC general secretary Oscar Fernandes, Bishop Lawrence Mukkuzhy of the Catholic Syro-Malabar Diocese of Belthangady, Geevarghese Mar Divannasious of the Syro-Malankara Diocese of Puttur, Diocesan Vicar-General Msgr Denis M. Prabhu; and some 24 new-generation churches united under the Karnataka Missions Network (KMN) including the Campus Crusade for Christ (CCC), Operation Mobilization Bookstall (OMB), Good News Book Centre (GNBC), All India Catholic Union (AICU), Catholic Association of South Kanara (CASK), and International Federation of Karnataka Christian Associations (IFKCA). Secular organisations participating in the protest included Udupi Jilla Alpasankhyatara Vedike (UJAV), the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), the DK District Committee, the local unit of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), and the Muslim Vartakara Sangha (VS) and Muslim Okkoota groups. The protest rally was [...] "organised {{against a backdrop of}} an apparent whitewash by the B. K. Somasekhara Commission concerning Hindu radicals and government agencies." [...] The protesters tied black cloths over their mouths and carried black flags as they walked silently for about a kilometre in one of the strongest Christian areas of the city. George Castelino, a Catholic lay leader who guided the march, stated that the black [...] "symbolised that the action of the government and its commission have silenced Christians." [...] Rev. Alwyn Culaso of the Full Gospel Church said that [...] "This is a sea of Christianity that is wounded by the attacks on the churches by the fundamental groups. The government should look at the faith and patience of these people and give justice." [...] On 17 February 2011, Ronald Colaco, Chairman of IFKCA and <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Minister</b> V. S. Acharya submitted a memorandum to Yeddyurappa, demanding that the cases filed against Christian youths be dropped. Following the publications of the reports and subsequent protests, the government of Karnataka announced that it would drop 338 cases against Christians who had protested in the attacks. In December 2011, 23 cases against Christians were dropped upon request by the Karnataka Christians International and the Mangalore Diocese.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} the {{relationship}} between <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>ministers</b> {{and the performance of}} the sector that they govern. Using an original panel dataset with the characteristics of European <b>higher</b> <b>education</b> <b>ministers,</b> we find that having a past experience in the sector leads to a higher level of performance, as measured by ranking data. Making a parallel with the literature about the impact of education on the educated, we discuss potential explanations behind the impact of this on-the-job learning experience. As we find that this characteristic has no impact on the spendings of the sector, we argue that this academic experience makes them more prone to introduce adequate reforms that makes the sector more attractive for top-researchers. Furthermore, we find that this result is driven by ministers with both sector-specific and electoral experience, the latter measured by a successful election at the regional or national level. This tends to show that political credibility should not be overshadowed by the importance of the sector-specific experience of ministers. Peer reviewe...|$|R

2500|$|Although the {{government}} announced a reduction of reliance of racial quotas in 2002, instead leaning more towards meritocracy. Before 2004, all lecturers in public tertiary institutions were required to have some post-graduate award as a qualification. In October 2004, this requirement was removed and the Higher Education Ministry announced that industry professionals who added value to a course could apply for lecturing positions directly to universities {{even if they did}} not have postgraduate qualifications. To head off possible allegations that the universities faced a shortage of lecturers, Deputy <b>Higher</b> <b>Education</b> <b>Minister</b> Datuk Fu Ah Kiow said [...] "This is not because we are facing a shortage of lecturers, but because this move will add value to our courses and enhance the name of our universities... Let's say Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg, both [...] well known and outstanding in their fields, want to be teaching professors. Of course, we would {{be more than happy to}} take them in."
