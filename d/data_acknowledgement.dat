40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} how SCTP can stall in multihomed scenarios during failover {{and under}} certain circumstances. A stall is where an SCTP end-point ceases to communicate {{for an extended}} period of time, but does not report any error to the upper layer. This paper presents two different sets of circumstances where a stall can occur: firstly when there is an underestimation of the Retransmission Time-Out (RTO) value for a redundant network path; and secondly when a network error occurs that causes only SACKs to be lost, which confuses the SCTP sender about which network path is operational. Solutions to both of these stalls are presented that include modifying the RTO value, applying Karn’s algorithm to path monitoring and ensuring the destination address selection policy for SACKs is changed. This paper also presents a mechanism to de-couple <b>data</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> and path monitoring when using multi-homed transport protocols, which should remove the ambiguity about path monitoring and offers a universal solution to the stall.

30|$|Recently, {{more and}} more attentions have focused on Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The {{coexistence}} of a massive number of IoT devices poses a challenge in maximizing the successful transmission capacity of the overall network alongside reducing the multi-hop transmission delay {{in order to support}} mission critical applications [1, 2]. As {{one of the most important}} and critical part of the IoTs, considerable progress has been made in the field of wireless ad hoc networks, particularly with respect to improving their transmission performance [3]. Two-way communication is one of the fundamental communication methods, such as state feedback among IoT devices, <b>data</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> or route initiation, and update requests. Two-way transmission capacity of a wireless ad hoc network refers to the maximum number of successful transmissions existing per unit network area, constrained by two-way outage probability. The transmission capacity provides a framework to derive closed-form bounds for the interference distribution by using stochastic geometry when the locations of nodes form a Poisson point process (PPP). Most of the previous works on deriving transmission capacity only focused on one-way transmission capacity (reverse communication from the destination to the source is ignored), which considered the effect of various physical and medium access layer techniques such as successive interference cancellation [4], multiple antennas [5 – 8], guard zone-based scheduling [9], and cooperative relaying [10, 11].|$|E

40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} (PSD) {{is an essential}} property of cement. The only standard method to measure the PSD of cement, namely ASTM C 115 [1] is limited in scope; this standard describes a method for determining “fineness ” with a lower size detection limit of 7. 5 µm. As there is no standard procedure covering {{the whole range of}} cement PSD, the implementation of different measurement methods varies widely within the industry. In general, the round-robin results summarized here have demonstrated the high variability between participants using instruments based on the same physical principles. ASTM committee C 01. 25. 01 sponsored a round-robin test to measure the PSD of cement. The aim of the current report is to analyze the data generated during those tests and to summarize the various approaches available to measure the PSD of cement. The analysis of the data is conducted in two parts. In the first part, an attempt is made to establish a reference distribution using a standard cement powder (SRM 114 p). This is followed up by a comparison of the roundrobin data in order to initiate discussion on developing a standard test method for cement PSD to be submitted for ASTM consideration. The report provides all raw data collected during the round robin tests, and the results of a statistical analysis of the collected <b>data.</b> <b>Acknowledgement...</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{the context}} of the road traffic {{collecting}} problem, the major issue that has not been sufficiently addressed by existing broadcasting and geocasting protocols is the reliable delivery of a message. Even though most of them are designed to avoid simultaneous broadcast transmissions by applying the waiting delay before rebroadcasting, the broadcast message reception can fail due to the hidden node problem. The sender can repeat its broadcast message if it does not hear a rebroadcast by another node as in IVG [9] and DRG [10], or if it does not receive an acknowledgement as in EDB [6], Geocache [16], and the work in [17]. UMB [4] and SB [5] use four messages in each hop, including the probe message, the probe acknowledgement, the data message, and the <b>data</b> <b>acknowledgement,</b> all of which are broadcast. Nevertheless, the broadcast sender may not hear the rebroadcast message or the acknowledgement because of a collision such that it could end up repeating the broadcast of the same message many times. Also, the larger the broadcast message, the more collisions it suffers when the network load increases. Our proposed protocol in the next section is designed to effectively disseminate a query message in a road network with intersections and in the presence of collisions. The proposed protocol broadcasts only a small probe message to increase the chance of successful reception of potential next rebroadcast nodes and a data message is then unicast. The protocol uses unicasting based on the RTS/CTS mechanism so that message collisions from the hidden node problem are alleviated.|$|E
40|$|Various {{applications}} {{for the purposes of}} event detection, localization, and monitoring can benefit from the use of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Wireless sensor networks are generally easy to deploy, with flexible topology and can support diversity of tasks thanks to the large variety of sensors that can be attached to the wireless sensor nodes. To guarantee the efficient operation of such a heterogeneous wireless sensor networks during its lifetime an appropriate management is necessary. Typically, there are three management tasks, namely monitoring, (re) configuration, and code updating. On the one hand, status information, such as battery state and node connectivity, of both the wireless sensor network and the sensor nodes has to be monitored. And on the other hand, sensor nodes have to be (re) configured, e. g., setting the sensing interval. Most importantly, new applications have to be deployed as well as bug fixes have to be applied during the network lifetime. All management tasks have to be performed in a reliable, time- and energy-efficient manner. The ability to disseminate data from one sender to multiple receivers in a reliable, time- and energy-efficient manner is critical for the execution of the management tasks, especially for code updating. Using multicast communication in wireless sensor networks is an efficient way to handle such traffic pattern. Due to the nature of code updates a multicast protocol has to support bulky traffic and endto-end reliability. Further, the limited resources of wireless sensor nodes demand an energy-efficient operation of the multicast protocol. Current data dissemination schemes do not fulfil all of the above requirements. In order to close the gap, we designed the Sensor Node Overlay Multicast (SNOMC) protocol such that to support a reliable, time-efficient and energy-efficient dissemination of data from one sender node to multiple receivers. In contrast to other multicast transport protocols, which do not support reliability mechanisms, SNOMC supports end-to-end reliability using a NACK-based reliability mechanism. The mechanism is simple and easy to implement and can significantly reduce the number of transmissions. It is complemented by a <b>data</b> <b>acknowledgement</b> after successful reception of all data fragments by the receiver nodes. In SNOMC three different caching strategies are integrated for an efficient handling of necessary retransmissions, namely, caching on each intermediate node, caching on branching nodes, or caching only on the sender node. Moreover, an option was included to pro-actively request missing fragments. SNOMC was evaluated both in the OMNeT++ simulator and in our in-house real-world testbed and compared to a number of common data dissemination protocols, such as Flooding, MPR, TinyCubus, PSFQ, and both UDP and TCP. The results showed that SNOMC outperforms the selected protocols in terms of transmission time, number of transmitted packets, and energy-consumption. Moreover, we showed that SNOMC performs well with different underlying MAC protocols, which support different levels of reliability and energy-efficiency. Thus, SNOMC can offer a robust, high-performing solution for the efficient distribution of code updates and management information in a wireless sensor network. To address the three management tasks, in this thesis we developed the Management Architecture for Wireless Sensor Networks (MARWIS). MARWIS is specifically designed for the management of heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. A distinguished feature of its design is the use of wireless mesh nodes as backbone, which enables diverse communication platforms and offloading functionality from the sensor nodes to the mesh nodes. This hierarchical architecture allows for efficient operation of the management tasks, due to the organisation of the sensor nodes into small sub-networks each managed by a mesh node. Furthermore, we developed a intuitive -based graphical user interface, which allows non-expert users to easily perform management tasks in the network. In contrast to other management frameworks, such as Mate, MANNA, TinyCubus, or code dissemination protocols, such as Impala, Trickle, and Deluge, MARWIS offers an integrated solution monitoring, configuration and code updating of sensor nodes. Integration of SNOMC into MARWIS further increases performance efficiency of the management tasks. To our knowledge, our approach is the first one, which offers a combination of a management architecture with an efficient overlay multicast transport protocol. This combination of SNOMC and MARWIS supports reliably, time- and energy-efficient operation of a heterogeneous wireless sensor network...|$|E

40|$|On Demand Multicast Routing Protocol (ODMRP) is a {{multicast}} {{routing protocol}} for mobile ad hoc networks. Although its simplicity and robustness to mobility, render {{it one of}} the most widely used MANET multicast protocols, it suffers from excessive control overhead and redundant data transmissions as the network size and the number of sources increase.

In this paper, we present a new method for reducing control overhead of ODMRP and called the new protocol LFPA_ODMRP (Limited Flooding by Passive <b>data</b> <b>Acknowledgements).</b> LFPA_ODMRP restricts some nodes to flood Join-Query packets by using passive data acknowledgments.

40|$|While {{much work}} has been done in mining nominal {{sequential}} data much less has been done on mining numeric time series data. This stems primarily from the problems of relating numeric data, which likely contains error or other variations which make directly relating values difficult. To handle this problem, many algo-rithms first convert data into a sequence of events. In some cases these events are known a priori, but in others they are not. Our work evaluates a set of time se-ries data instances in order to determine likely candidates for unknown underlying events. We use the concept of bounding envelopes to represent the area around a numeric time series in which the unknown noise-free points could exist.

40|$|Cursor {{model is}} a {{relatively}} new approach for XML processing. In this model, a cursor acts like a lens that focuses on one node. You can freely move the cursor back and forth in an XML document, and edit the node it indicates. This model can be easily implemented in imperative language like C or Java, by using a pointer to subtree in the XML tree as the cursor. In a fully applicative setting, however, this simple scheme does not work since subtree modification through pointers breaks the principle of referential transparency. We propose a purely functional data structure named “Slit ” to realize a cursor on a tree efficiently in applicative manner. Slit is similar to the zipper data structure introduced by Huet, but has some improvements compared to the zipper in terms of efficiency and expressiveness while handling a tree with variadic child nodes. Using the slit, we implement an XML processing framework based on the cursor model. We also show a generalization of this framework to give an XML view for non XML <b>data.</b> <b>Acknowledgements</b> I would like to thank Professor Akihiko Takano for his invaluable comments and suggestions.

40|$|Mathematical {{modelling}} of epidemics is {{very important}} in gaining an understanding of the spread of infections. Recently, there has been interest in stochastic models for epidemics. We analyse two epidemic models- the Susceptible-Infective-Recovered (SIR) model and the Reed-Frost Epidemic Model. We try to estimate the infection rate for the Reed-Frost Epidemic model using both classical maximum likelihood methods and Gibbs Sampling. We also use Approximate Bayesian Computation to estimate the rate of infection and recovery for the SIR model. We cannot apply maximum likelihood and Gibbs Sampling methods to the SIR model as its likelihood is not readily computed. The results for the maximum likelihood and Gibbs Sampling methods for the Reed-Frost model agree, but the model does not appear to fit the data well. When considering the SIR model Approximate Bayesian Computation accurately returns parameter values when we have complete data. It performs less well when we have incomplete data. Further work needs to be carried out before we can say whether Approximate Bayesian Computation is useful when considering real-life data sets, which often have incomplete <b>data.</b> <b>Acknowledgements</b> Many thanks to Jotun Hein for his guidance.

40|$|The {{iterative}} {{modeling and}} imaging in depth procedure {{were applied to}} a 3 D high-resolution seismic survey {{in order to improve}} the knowledge about the multilayered aquifer. The 3 D cubes detected with high accuracy the vertical sequence and the lateral variations of the layers, extending so the well information to the surrounding area. This information are very useful, because it allow us to optimise the location of new wells, or to detect deeper sources, with a lower pollution hazard. The more significant result of this work, which proves the effectiveness of the seismic method in aquifer exploration, is the discovery of two new aquifers located at about 270 m and 480 m. In fact, a new 510 m deep well was drilled by the water-supply company “Acque del Basso Livenza s. p. a. ” at about 200 m from the seismic survey {{on the basis of the}} seismic results which suggested the pos-sible presence of a deeper aquifer.
