40|$|Scholarly expositions of {{the sermon}} in Luke 12 : 1 - 13 : 9 tend {{to divide the}} {{discourse}} into two thematically distinct sections: Luke 12 : 1 - 34 is exposited in terms of wealth ethics, while the eschatological comments of 12 : 35 - 13 : 9 {{are said to be}} spiritual in their focus. The present article argues that the two halves of the sermon cannot be separated in this manner, and shows that the eschatological paraenesis of 12 : 35 - 13 : 9 is especially concerned to stimulate the proper use of wealth. To substantiate this reading, the essay proceeds sequentially through the constituent pericopae of 12 : 35 - 13 : 9. Supplementing conventional historico-linguistic exegesis with narrative criticism and occasional attention to patristic interpretation, the article shows how Luke 12 : 35 - 13 : 9 contributes to the wealth-ethical comments which feature so prominently in 12 : 1 - 34, and thus underscores how tightly <b>eschatology</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethics</b> are interwoven in Lukan soteriology.

40|$|My {{study is}} a first step toward {{understanding}} the lived experience of the earliest followers of Christ. Restricting my study to Paul’s portrayal of believers in 1 Corinthians, I focus where Paul’s anthropology, <b>eschatology,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethics</b> converge, asking: How does Paul propose believers live as bodies in the eschatological tension that comprises Christ’s resurrection and return – believers belonging still to the κόσμος, already to Christ? My primary aim is to establish the premises that in 1 Corinthians believers are indistinguishable from bodies: believers are bodies. I establish my premiss by closely examining Paul’s concept of death as he argues it in 1 Corinthians 15. I argue that there Paul portrays believers consistently as bodies: whether bodies dead or bodies alive, believers are bodies. My aim, secondarily, is to relate that premiss to the believer’s lived experience as Paul portrays it. If Paul portrays believers always as bodies, how does he expect believers-as-bodies to live in the world as he conceives it? I apply my premiss to Paul’s contention in 1 Corinthians 6 that πορνεία uniquely violates the body. Before unpacking Paul’s argument about πορνεία and the body, however, I first address the question: What is πορνεία? After reviewing competing proposals on πορνεία’s meaning, I examine primary Second Temple sources on πορνεία before proposing that πορνεία functions in the Second Temple period chiefly as an othering term, distinguishing the faithful from ‘Others’. I then turn to 1 Corinthians 6. 12 - 20 and Paul’s argument concerning believers-as-bodies and πορνεία. I conclude that Paul there presents believers as bodies that belong already materially to the Lord, though they belong still to the κόσμος that contests the Lord. Believers are bodies ‘in Christ’, in the κόσμος, constituent of each. I approach Paul exegetically and ideationally. I read Paul’s arguments and their inherent logics as they present themselves to me and I defend my reading of them. I make no claims about the social reality Paul’s arguments represent, nor do I claim either a foundational or a final reading of 1 Corinthians, Paul, or Paul’s followers. I offer in the end the barest beginning of an examination of the lived experience of the earliest recorded followers of Christ – a platform from which to consider more broadly lived experiences in Christian origins. I achieve a perspective from which to assess Paul’s followers, concluding with some ideas for further study. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|M. Litt. et Phil. The {{role of the}} Spirit in the Eschatological Ethics of Revelation was a {{topic that}} has given me Great Joy to learn {{in the book of}} Revelation the role of the Spirit, <b>Eschatology</b> <b>and</b> <b>Ethics.</b> In this book I have {{discovered}} the plan of Salvation which was laid before the foundation of the World in a very clear manner. God, The Master of the universe, revealed to John the final story of this world's history, at the Isles of Patmos. The Trinity is well explained and even their duties as the God Head. God The Father, God The Son and God The Holy Ghost of which my dissertation is looking at the office or the role of the Spirit in the Second Coming of Christ. From Genesis to Malachi, it is God the Father who revealed himself to mankind, and from Matthew to Acts 1 : 8., It is God the Son who came in person to reveal God the Father and from Acts 1 : 9 to Revelation it is God the Holy Spirit who will teach us all that God the son could not finish teaching us. The Script is divided into Five Chapters which are the orientation into the book of Revelation, the theology and the ethics of the book of Revelation, the Eschatological Ethics in Revelation, the Holy Spirit in Revelation {{and the role of the}} Spirit and the Eschatological Ethics of Revelation, which is the theme of this script. Then we have the conclusion of the script. There are very few books written on Revelation and let alone on the Spirit but I have tried to outline the role of the spirit in this great book of the Bible and I hope to research further on some issues that are hard in Revelation. It is the book that summarises the history of the World Kingdoms in only 22 Chapters and I have limited mine to only Five Chapters. The Spirit has played the greatest role in Revelation because according to plan it is the time for it to play its role. The last events of this world will be shocking, the devil is angry. In the book of Revelation God calls Himself as the King of kings and Lord of Lords. He is the Almighty God. All creation own their existence to Him. It was one book of the Bible I did not like reading, but the research has helped me to develop some liking for the book. It is the book for our modern generation and unlike the book of Daniel which was to be put away until the end times, this one is to be read and a blessing is pronounce to the one who will read the book. We need to read this book very much and books that are in context should be written about the book. The few books that have been written on Revelation are not all very relevant. They miss the point. Most of them need well researched books to make clear the mysteries that are in Revelation and the Bible explains itself even in other books of the Bible which can also be used to explain the book of Revelation. The book of Daniel even though its in the old Testament, it has a lot in common with the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation opens for the reading of the book of Daniel in the old Testament and for one to understand Revelation well, one needs to read the book of Daniel together with Revelation. The beasts in Daniel are the beasts in Revelation. Even though some people would want to divide the old and the new Testament, they are the same and they interpret each other very well. The new testament has a lot of old testament quotations. I am trying to correct some misinterpretation of some verses found in the Book of Revelation and It will be good for any one who will read this script to read it carefully and critically because in the field of learning we learn by making mistakes and your input will be appreciated. In Revelation the devil is being given the last warning and all those that need life are called to come out of Babylon the Mother of all Harlots because if we do not come out of her and keep the commandments of God, then we will drink of the wrath of God which will be poured without a mixture for all those that worship the beast and its image...|$|E

40|$|Although {{we live in}} a post-metaphysical age, {{there is}} a renewed {{interest}} in transcendence, especially at the intersection of philosophy, religion, and theology. There are several reasons for this: among others, the important link that the future (eschatology) has with the unknown or that which lies beyond (transcendence). In this article, this relation between <b>eschatology</b> <b>and</b> transcendence is explored by analysing different concepts of transcendence and their possible relations to the future. Jacques Derrida and Catharine Malabou’s concepts of the future are used to shed light on the link between <b>eschatology</b> <b>and</b> transcendence as “impossible”. Secondly, Jean-Luc Nancy’s concept of transimmanence is introduced, in an attempt to find such a possible link. A reconceptualisation of transcendence as transimmanence and a reconceptualisation of the future of eschatology as something “outside within”, facilitate a link between these terms, but the original or general meanings of these terms then become impossible. This outcome urges a rethinking of the meaning and role of transcendence, <b>eschatology,</b> <b>and</b> the future in our post-metaphysical age...|$|R
