5|$|In New York, Michael {{manages to}} talk to Wallace, who has {{seemingly}} been avoiding him, and complains that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> {{that he has to}} drive to New York in order {{to talk to}} him instead of on the phone, and that he deserves more respect after being at Dunder Mifflin for fifteen years. David agrees to fund an anniversary party for him and attend, but Michael abruptly announces his resignation from the company and walks out.|$|E
5|$|In {{a number}} of countries, mainly in Asia, {{legislation}} or corporate practice has introduced formal menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid {{leave of absence from}} their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> to men.|$|E
5|$|Steph is {{diagnosed}} with cervical cancer {{and does not}} tell Gilly, who later finds out from Cheryl. Gilly is angry at Steph for keeping this from him. Steph undergoes a hysterectomy to remove the cancer. However, doctors tell her and Gilly it failed. She is soon told her cancer is terminal. Gilly takes the news bad. The pair split up when Steph feels <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> on Gilly, but they get back together and start to plan their wedding. Gilly and Steph eventually get married beside the village river.|$|E

25|$|The party {{opposes the}} government's {{naturalisation}} policies, and contends that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> for ethnic Bahrainis to compete equally with foreign workers for jobs. The Nationalist Democratic Assembly remains pro-Saddam Hussein and, {{according to its}} webpage, supports the Arab Spring. It opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, considering it an act of brutality against the Iraqi people.

25|$|A bowler may {{attempt to}} run out a batsman who leaves his ground before he {{delivers}} the ball, but must do so before he reaches the point in his action when he would normally release the ball. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> for batsmen to attempt to steal runs during the bowler's run-up. If they try the umpires will allow the bowler to attempt a run out. Should the bowler not attempt a run out then the umpires will call dead ball, return the batsmen to their previous ends and award a 5 run penalty to the fielding side.|$|E

As per estimates by the National Wages and Productivity Board, there are 7 million workers earning the minimum wage and even below.

25|$|A {{particularly}} prominent {{criticism of}} strong reciprocity {{theory is that}} it does not correspond to behavior found in the actual environment. In particular, the existence of third party punishment in the field is called into question. Some have responded to this criticism by pointing out that if effective, third party punishment will rarely be used, and will therefore be difficult to observe. Others have suggested that there is evidence of third party costly punishment in the field. Critics have responded to these claims by arguing that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> for proponents to argue that both a demonstration of costly third party punishment as well as a lack of costly third party punishment are both evidence of its existence. They also question whether the ethnographic evidence presented is costly third party punishment, and call for additional analysis of the costs and benefits of the punishment. Other research has shown that different types of strong reciprocity do not predict other types of strong reciprocity within individuals.|$|E
500|$|The {{project is}} widely opposed in Nevada {{and is a}} hotly debated {{national}} topic. A two-thirds majority of Nevadans feel <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> for their state to have to store nuclear waste {{when there are no}} nuclear power plants in Nevada Many Nevadans' opposition stemmed from the so-called [...] "Screw Nevada Bill," [...] the 1987 legislation halting study of Hanford and Texas as potential sites for the waste before conclusions could be made. The local county in which the proposed facility is located, Nye County, supports the development of the repository as do six adjoining counties.|$|E
500|$|In Coughlan {{the view}} was {{expressed}} that the court will assess whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> for an authority to frustrate a legitimate expectation when the expectation is [...] "confined to one person or a few people, giving the promise or representation {{the character of a}} contract". In R. (Bancoult) v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No. 2) (2007), it was accepted that members of a group of close to a thousand or even up to several thousand people could have a legitimate expectation of a substantive benefit following the government's announcement of its intentions.|$|E

500|$|In 1960, the London cast {{recording}} was released. [...] According to Hischak, {{the individual}} performers do not sing {{as well as}} the New York cast; the London recording's strong points are the nightclub numbers. [...] The 1961 album from the film uses a larger orchestra and, according to Hischak, has a fuller sound than the Broadway recording. [...] It features dubbing by the opera singer Marilyn Horne ("Love, Look Away") and band singer B. J. Baker (for Linda Low's songs). [...] A cast album for Hwang's revision was released in 2002 featuring strong performances from Lea Salonga as Mei-li and Jose Llana as Wang Ta. [...] This was nominated for a Grammy, though it did not win. [...] Hischak notes that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> to compare the later version with its earlier predecessors, as Hwang's version [...] "has some of the dark corners and richness of a musical play".|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{the boycott}} had {{attracted}} support from Sir Richard Branson of Virgin Group, {{as well as}} numerous Hollywood executives and stars, including Jay Leno and Ellen DeGeneres. In addition, a string of organizations joined the boycott, cancelling reservations to hold conferences and other high-profile events at the establishment; travel industry firms likewise signed on to a boycott of all Dorchester Collection hotels. Others, including Russell Crowe and Kim Kardashian, have spoken out against the boycott. Crowe stated that despite his disapproval of the new laws in Brunei, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> to punish the hardworking employees of the hotel. Similarly, Kardashian published a blog post voicing her criticism of the boycott and expressing her sympathies for the hotel workers. HR Magazine said that the protests are [...] "misguided" [...] and will not affect the government policy of Brunei when the Dorchester Collection's annual revenue is $300 million while the BIA has over $30 billion in assets from oil and gas.|$|E
500|$|The {{arguments}} for light rail were mainly {{related to the}} environment, urban development and reduction in road congestion. Light rail is estimated to increase {{the use of public}} transport from Fana, reducing both local and global pollution. The roads do not have capacity for further growth, and any increase in public transport would need to be taken along the light rail routes on buses—this would give higher operating costs for public transport or higher investment costs for roads. Around the stations, high-density commercial and residential centers can be established. Opponents of the project argued that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> that public transport be funded by car drivers through toll roads. Protests from people in northern and western areas of the city have risen, since they are paying for the system but will not receive the benefits. Another issue has been speed: the line to Nesttun has 15 stops in , giving an average speed of [...] For people living south of Nesttun, this will give a longer travel time to the city center than with direct buses that do not make intermediate stops.|$|E

500|$|Bret Fetzer of Amazon.com {{wrote that}} [...] "it's best to {{approach}} this season {{as if it were}} a completely new series". He felt that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unfair</b> to compare the quality of this season to that of past seasons because [...] "the series' previous heights were so very high". However, he called the year [...] "uneven", because episodes would range from putting [...] "Andy into Michael Scott-ish situations" [...] to [...] "seek out new angles on the well-established web of interpersonal conflicts". This vacillation between extremes meant that the episodes [...] "sometimes" [...] work. Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon considered the post-Michael Scott era of The Office [...] "warmer and more reflective". He also praised the decision of Andy as a manager, and he highlighted Ed Helms and Craig Robinson's performances in [...] "Lotto", arguing that they represented the [...] "subtlest, deepest acting to date [...] ". He also selected [...] "Lotto" [...] as the best episode of the season. Hank Stuever of The Washington Post named the series the tenth best series of 2011, specifically praising the actors' ability in [...] "Mrs. California" [...] to deliver cringe humor without Carell. TV Guide named it an honorable mention on their list of the best TV shows of 2011. Price Peterson from TV.com called the series [...] "still one of the best shows on TV" [...] and argued that, while [...] "Season 8 definitely wasn't the show's best", the season [...] "sneaked in some genuinely great jokes, new characters, and affecting plotlines." [...] Despite the lackluster reviews many of the episodes received, many critics praised Ellie Kemper's performance as Erin Hannon. McNutt noted that [...] "regardless of how down I was on this or any other episode, Ellie Kemper really has been tremendous all season." [...] In addition, Kemper's performance in the episodes [...] "Spooked," [...] "Christmas Wishes," [...] "Pool Party," [...] and [...] "Special Project," [...] in particular, were praised by critics.|$|E

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has proposed educational reform in New Jersey that pressures teachers not only to [...] "teach to the test," [...] but also have their students perform at the potential cost of their salary and job security. The reform calls for performance-based pay that depends on students' performances on standardized tests and their educational gains.
