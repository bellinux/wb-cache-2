25|$|The {{general rule}} is that arteries from the heart branch out into capillaries, which collect into veins leading back to the heart. Portal veins are a slight {{exception}} to this. In humans the only significant example is the <b>hepatic</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> which combines from capillaries around the gastrointestinal tract where the blood absorbs the various products of digestion; rather than leading directly back to the heart, the <b>hepatic</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> branches into a second capillary system in the liver.|$|E

25|$|Portal vein {{thrombosis}} affects the <b>hepatic</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein,</b> {{which can lead}} to portal hypertension and reduction of the blood supply to the liver. It usually happens in the setting of another disease such as pancreatitis, cirrhosis, diverticulitis or cholangiocarcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Complications involve {{portal vein}} {{thrombosis}} and splenic vein thrombosis: clotting of blood affects the <b>hepatic</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> or varices associated with splenic vein. This {{can lead to}} portal hypertension and reduction in blood flow. When a liver cirrhosis patient is suffering from thrombosis, {{it is not possible}} to perform a liver transplant, unless the thrombosis is very minor.

25|$|The {{first pass}} through the <b>hepatic</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> results {{in some of the}} drug being metabolized by O-demethylation into an active {{metabolite}} of dextromethorphan called dextrorphan (DXO). DXO is the 3-hydroxy derivative of dextromethorphan. The therapeutic activity of dextromethorphan is believed to be caused by both the drug and this metabolite. Dextromethorphan also undergoes N-demethylation (to 3-methoxymorphinan or MEM), and partial conjugation with glucuronic acid and sulfate ions. Hours after dextromethorphan therapy, (in humans) the metabolites (+)-3-hydroxy-N-methylmorphinan, (+)-3-morphinan, and traces of the unchanged drug are detectable in the urine.|$|E

40|$|A {{method for}} {{systematic}} {{examination of the}} livers was developed, based on identification of the <b>hepatic</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> in sixteen dogs. The right medial, quadrate, left medial and lateral hepatic veins and the hepatic branches of the <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> were easily located with the dog in dorsal recumbency. The right lateral and caudate hepatic veins were identified more easily from the right side with the transducer positioned between the ninth to the eleventh intercostal spaces. Visibility was affected by the fullness of the stomach but this effect could be minimized by changing {{the position of the}} transducer to select a more suitable anatomical approach. Identification of the two systems depended on their echogenicity, the anatomical position of the main branches and their pattern of distribution. As in humans, the <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> were in general, more echogenic than the hepatic veins and the hepatic veins could be traced from their junctions with the caudal vena cava. Identification of the branches of the <b>hepatic</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> was complicated by the anatomical shape, the nutritional status and respiratory stage of the animal. A systemic approach based on a knowledge of the distribution patterns produced by the <b>hepatic</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> ensures that all liver lobes are identified and all important structures are assessed.

25|$|Roughly, transudates are {{a result}} of {{increased}} pressure in the <b>hepatic</b> <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> (>8 mmHg, usually around 20 mmHg), e.g. due to cirrhosis, while exudates are actively secreted fluid due to inflammation or malignancy. As a result, exudates are high in protein and lactate dehydrogenase and have a low pH (<7.30), a low glucose level, and more white blood cells. Transudates have low protein (<30 g/L), low LDH, high pH, normal glucose, and fewer than 1 white cell per 1000nbsp&mm³. Clinically, the most useful measure is the difference between ascitic and serum albumin concentrations. A difference of less than 1 g/dl (10 g/L) implies an exudate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{umbilical}} cord enters the fetus via the abdomen, {{at the point}} which (after separation) will become the umbilicus (or navel).

40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{investigate}} the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with the doppler waveform pattern of <b>hepatic</b> <b>veins</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> doppler indices. Objectives: This assay may be useful in evaluating the natural course of NAFLD and monitor treatment efficacy on follow-up. Patients and Methods: This case control study was performed in 31 patients with NAFLD and 31 normal healthy adults who served as the control group. The patients presented with elevated liver enzymes levels (ALT/AST) and hyperechogenic livers in the B-mode ultrasonography examination. Eleven patients had a liver biopsy.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of software {{for a personal}} computer in the interactive generation of three-dimensional (3 D) images from computer tomography was studied in six pig livers after hepatic resection and catheterization of the <b>hepatic</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>veins.</b> After perfusion the livers were submitted to computed tomography angiography, volumetric measurement by water displacement, and production of an acrylic model of the veins by the injection and corrosion method, by which the lengths of the <b>hepatic</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> were measured. From the angiogram, the software generated a 3 D image that allowed measurement of the vein lengths. the identified branches of the <b>hepatic</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> were correlated with the hepatic sectors and segments, respectively. the virtual measures from the 3 D images were compared with the real measures. There {{were no significant differences}} between the topography and the vessel length. the mean difference between the volumes calculated from software and those measured by water displacement corresponded to 1. 2 %, and between the vessel lengths, 0. 2 %. in conclusion, the software for personal computer (named LIVFER 3 D) is efficient, allowing interactive inspection of 3 D images.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{reconstruction}} of the biliary tree, <b>hepatic</b> artery, and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> in normal rats and rats fed α-naphthylisothiocyanate (ANIT), a compound that causes selective proliferation of epithelial cells (ie, cholangiocytes) that line the bile ducts, was performed. All hepatic structures in ANIT-fed rats branched 1. 5 times more often than in normal rats, reflecting an increased number of segments, whereas {{the length of the}} biliary tree, <b>hepatic</b> artery, and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> remain unchanged. The length of the proximal vessel segments was uniform in both groups of rats whereas the length of distal segments decreased twofold in ANIT-fed rats, suggesting that small vessels preferentially undergo proliferation. In contrast, the length of all bile duct segments decreased twofold, suggesting that ANIT induced proliferation of all compartments of the biliary tree. The total volume of the biliary tree, <b>hepatic</b> artery, and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> was increased 18, 4, and 3 times, respectively, after ANIT feeding. The diameters of the bile ducts (range, 20 to 259 μm) and arterial (range, 21 to 276 μm) segments in ANIT-fed rats did not differ from normal rats (range, 21 to 245 μm and 20 to 265 μm, respectively). In contrast, the diameters of proximal venous segments in ANIT-fed rats were significantly less (316 ± 68 μm versus 488 ± 89 μm, P < 0. 001). The data suggest that after experimentally induced cholangiocyte proliferation, the <b>hepatic</b> artery and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> also undergo marked proliferation, presumably to support the increased nutritional and functional demands of the proliferated bile ducts.

40|$|Abstract Background Hepatic {{resection}} is {{the only}} effective treatment for combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Case presentation A 52 -year-old man was preoperatively diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in segment 2 with tumor thrombus in the segment 2 portal branch. Anatomical liver segmentectomy 2, including separation of the <b>hepatic</b> arteries, <b>portal</b> <b>veins,</b> and bile duct, enabled us to remove the tumor and portal thrombus completely. Modified selective hepatic vascular exclusion, which combines extrahepatic control of the left and middle hepatic veins with occlusion of left hemihepatic inflow, was used to reduce blood loss. A pathological examination revealed combined hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma with tumor thrombus in the segment 2 portal branch. No postoperative liver failure occurred, and remnant liver function was adequate. Conclusion The separation method of the <b>hepatic</b> arteries, <b>portal</b> <b>veins,</b> and bile duct is safe and feasible for a liver cancer patient with <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> tumor thrombus. Modified selective hepatic vascular exclusion was useful to control bleeding during liver transection. Anatomical liver segmentectomy 2 using these procedures should be considered for a patient with a liver tumor located at segment 2 arising from a damaged liver. </p...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to provide a {{description}} of the ultrasonographic and angiographic anatomy of the <b>hepatic</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> in normal dogs. Knowledge of this anatomy is essential for the proper diagnosis and correction of hepatic vessel anomalies like portal systemic shunts. Cranial mesenteric portography was done in 10 adult mongrel dogs to visualize the <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> and its branches while the hepatic veins were visualized using the transvenous retrograde angiography method. Longitudinal and transverse ultrasound scans of the liver were done in the same dogs in left and right lateral positions in order to determine the best positions for imaging the different liver vessels. The distribution pattern of the <b>hepatic</b> and <b>portal</b> <b>veins</b> could be demonstrated by both ultrasonography and contrast angiography. Hepatic arteries are not usually visualized ultrasonographically. Ultrasound provided dynamic information that could not be obtained by contrast radiography. Super imposition of all vessels in the angiographic studies made the description of the branches of the liver vessels difficult. The results of the present study suggest that both methods may provide important complementary information in the diagnosis and planning of surgical procedures for the correction of vessel anomalies in the canine liver...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{clarify the}} {{variations}} of the intrahepatic artery and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> and to verify the proper segmentation for the right anterior section of the liver. Materials and methods: CT during arterial portography and CT angiography were performed on 64 -slice multi detector row CT in 147 patients. All images were transferred to a workstation for analysis using multi-image-fusion mode. We investigated the spatial relationship between <b>hepatic</b> artery and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> in the right hemiliver and the segmentation of the right anterior <b>hepatic</b> artery and <b>portal</b> <b>vein.</b> Results: The spatial anatomy of right <b>hepatic</b> arteries and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> was (1) anterior and posterior hepatic artery run superior and inferior to anterior <b>portal</b> <b>vein,</b> respectively (47. 6 %), (2) one anterior hepatic artery runs superior to and another one runs inferior to anterior <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> (15 %), (3) anterior and posterior hepatic arteries run superior to anterior <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> (11. 6 %), (4) anterior and posterior hepatic arteries run inferior to anterior <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> (7. 5 %), and (5) one posterior hepatic artery runs superior to and another one runs inferior to anterior <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> (6. 8 %). The combined anatomy of right anterior artery and <b>portal</b> <b>vein</b> with regard to segmentation was classified as (1) dorso-ventral (26. 5 %), (2) dorso-ventral and inferior (10. 9 %), (3) multiple (18. 4 %), and (4) superior and inferior segments (1. 4 %).
