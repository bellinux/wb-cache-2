25|$|An <b>electret</b> <b>microphone</b> {{is a type}} of {{condenser}} microphone, which {{eliminates the}} need for a power supply by using a permanently charged material. Electret materials have been known since the 1920s, and were proposed as condenser microphone elements several times, but were considered impractical until the foil electret type was invented at Bell Laboratories in 1962 by Jim West, using a thin metallized Teflon foil. This became the most common type, used in many applications from high-quality recording and lavalier use to built-in microphones in small sound recording devices and telephones.|$|E

40|$|For a {{connected}} digits {{speech recognition}} task, we have compared {{the performance of}} two inexpensive <b>electret</b> <b>microphones</b> {{with that of a}} single high quality PZM microphone. Recognition error rates were measured both with and without compensation techniques, where both single-channel and two-channel approaches were used. In all cases the task was recognition at a significant distance (2 [...] 6 feet) from the talker's mouth. The results suggest that the wide variability in characteristics among inexpensive <b>electret</b> <b>microphones</b> can be compensated for without explicit quality control, and that this is particularly effective when both single-channel and two-channel techniques are used. In particular, the resulting performance for the inexpensive microphones used together is essentially equivalent to the expensive microphone, and better than for either inexpensive microphone used alone...|$|R

50|$|The {{transducers}} in {{most common}} loudspeakers (e.g. woofers and tweeters), are electromagnetic devices that generate waves using a suspended diaphragm {{driven by an}} electromagnetic voice coil, sending off pressure waves. <b>Electret</b> <b>microphones</b> and condenser microphones employ electrostatics—as the sound wave strikes the microphone's diaphragm, it moves and induces a voltage change. The ultrasonic systems used in medical ultrasonography employ piezoelectric transducers. These are made from special ceramics in which mechanical vibrations and electrical fields are interlinked through a property of the material itself.|$|R

40|$|Wake-airfoil {{interaction}} {{noise is}} a concern for many applications such as contra-rotating open rotors, aeroengine rotor-stator interaction and high density wind-farms. In this study we propose a measurement procedure, based on the implementation of low-cost <b>electret</b> <b>microphones</b> flush-mounted {{on the surface of}} an airfoil subjected to incoming rotating wakes. This methodology is applied on the characterization of the chord-wise distribution of unsteady pressure jump. This paper demonstrates that the <b>electret</b> <b>microphones</b> can provide high measurement repeatability on a broad range of frequencies and that they can be applied to engineering measurements. The electrets are applied to a rotor-wake- airfoil interaction case, where aerodynamic quantities, e. g. wall-pressure fluctuation and propagation velocity are compared with results from linearized airfoil theory. It is shown that he correct electrets phase calibration allows the computation of the perturbation propagation velocity along the airfoil chord. Correlation levels between the wall pressure jump and the far-field noise are established for different frequencies and regions of the airfoil. The measured wall pressure fluctuations were used as input for Curle’s analogy for far-field noise prediction, and the results were compared with measurements, showing good agreement. Finally, the upstream wake flow velocity was measured by means of hot-wire anemometry and the resulting space-averaged incoming flow velocity fluctuation were used as input for an unsteady panel code. In this case, the predicted wall pressure fluctuation and the far-field noise are compared showing both also good agreement. status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|An {{electret}} is {{a stable}} dielectric material with a permanently embedded static {{electric dipole moment}} (which, due to the high resistance and chemical stability of the material, will not decay for hundreds of years).

Electrets are commonly made by first melting a suitable dielectric material such as a plastic or wax that contains polar molecules, and then allowing it to re-solidify in a powerful electrostatic field.
