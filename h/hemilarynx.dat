40|$|BACKGROUND: Organ-preservation {{approaches}} are frequently favored {{in the treatment}} of advanced pyriform sinus carcinoma. In selected cases, use of free flaps allows voice-sparing surgery. METHODS:Thirteen patients underwent conservative extended laryngopharyngectomy. In 11 patients, the resection included the supraglottic larynx, whereas the whole <b>hemilarynx</b> was resected in 2. Reconstruction was achieved with a radial forearm free flap with the palmaris longus tendon. In <b>hemilarynx</b> resection, a costal graft was also used. Functional results were assessed by nasofibroscopy and swallowing videofluoroscopic tests. RESULTS: At 12 months, no patient was gastrostomy dependent, whereas 1 patient remained tracheostomy dependent. At 1, 3, and 5 years, the locoregional control was 100 %, 100 %, and 83 %; overall survival was 69. 4 %, 46. 3 %, and 30. 8 %; and disease-specific survival was 81. 2 %, 54. 5 %, and 36. 4 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients, extended conservative laryngopharyngectomy challenges the oncologic results of organ-preservation protocols and allows a good quality of life...|$|E
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{malignant}} laryngeal tumours can extend from their site of origin into tributary lymph nodes, depending on their location and size. Management protocols almost always include concomitant surgical treatment of both the tumour and cervical nodes. When palpable lymph nodes are present, dissection is mandatory but there is no general agreement on the option of choice in clinically N 0 patients. Elective neck dissection, following the current indications, is necessary in most cases of N 0 laryngeal cancer, but the number of bilateral dissections may be limited. In tumours of only one <b>hemilarynx</b> or extending slightly beyond it, metastatic involvement {{is more likely to be}} on the same side as the lesion although there is no absolute certainty that it will be. In these cases, and especially in supraglottic tumours, occult metastatic spread may also penetrate into the contralateral lymph nodes of the neck. The present report deals with the results of a surgical strategy to limit bilateral elective dissection, based on the following criteria. In supraglottic tumours of only one <b>hemilarynx</b> or extending slightly beyond it, the presence of ipsilateral node metastases is highly predictive of a concomitant involvement of the contralateral nodes. In these supraglottic tumours, only in cases with post-operative serial positive histology of the uni-ipsilateral dissected cervical lymph nodes, has contralateral elective neck dissection (“conditional dissection”) been performed. “Conditional dissections” led to a reduction of approximately 70 % of elective bilateral neck dissections...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{laryngeal}} tuberculosis is rare. It can manifest as a malignancy {{delaying the}} diagnosis and the therapeutic management. We report {{the case of a}} 34 -year-old immunocompetent man whose plaints were fever, sweat and dysphonia. There were no adenopathy, nor hepatosplenomegaly. Several blood cultures were negative. Laboratory studies showed an inflammatory syndrome. In addition, the bacteriological examinations of sputum and urine in search of Mycobacterium tuber-culosis were negative. Laryngoscopy confirmed the presence of a thickness of the right vocal cord and an ulcer in the <b>hemilarynx.</b> The histological examination revealed tuberculoid granulomas suggestive of tuberculosis.

40|$|AbstractIntroductionLymphoepithelial {{carcinoma}} {{is a rare}} tumour, {{named after}} its histological resemblance to undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The pathogenesis of lymphoepithelial carcinoma remains unknown. This tumour has been described in several organs, but the larynx remains an exceptional site. Case reportThe authors report {{the case of a}} 73 -year-old man who consulted for longstanding dysphonia and rapidly deteriorating dyspnoea requiring emergency tracheotomy. Endoscopic examination demonstrated a tumour of the left <b>hemilarynx</b> with fixed vocal cords. Histological examination and immunohistochemistry demonstrated lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the larynx. Screening for Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization was positive. Treatment consisting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection and then external beam radiotherapy achieved cure with a follow-up of 18 months since completion of treatment. DiscussionLymphoepithelial carcinoma of the larynx is rare. Immunohistochemical examination is essential for the positive diagnosis. Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoepithelial carcinoma has been exceptionally reported. The radiosensitivity of this tumour allows conservative first-line treatment...|$|E
40|$|Acinic cell {{carcinoma}} (ACC) {{is a rare}} tumor generally involving the parotid gland and infrequently the minor salivary glands {{with the potential for}} both local recurrence and metastatic spread when tracked for decades. The biological behavior of ACC cannot be predicted on the basis of histological features, and surgical stage is still the best predictor of clinical outcome. Only 5 cases of ACC of the larynx {{have been reported in the}} English literature. The authors present a case of a rare transglottic ACC in a 74 -year-old woman. At admission, a submucosal mass involving the left arytenoid and adjacent aryepiglottic fold was noted. A CT scan of the head and neck region showed a mass of the left <b>hemilarynx</b> involving the paraglottic space and extending from the aryepiglottic fold to the sinus piriformis. Definitive histopathological examination showed an ACC with a large amount of clear cells. The patient was treated by radiotherapy alone (66 Gy in 7 weeks) with complete remission...|$|E
40|$|Patients with {{laryngeal}} disorders {{may have}} severe morbidity relating to swallowing, vocalization, and respiratory function, for which conventional therapies are suboptimal. A tissue-engineered approach would aim {{to restore the}} vocal folds and maintain respiratory function while limiting the extent of scarring in the regenerated tissue. Under Good Laboratory Practice conditions, we decellularized porcine larynges, using detergents and enzymes under negative pressure to produce an acellular scaffold comprising cartilage, muscle, and mucosa. To assess safety and functionality before clinical trials, a decellularized <b>hemilarynx</b> seeded with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and a tissue-engineered oral mucosal sheet was implanted orthotopically into six pigs. The seeded grafts were left in situ for 6 months and assessed using computed tomography imaging, bronchoscopy, and mucosal brushings, together with vocal recording and histological analysis on explantation. The graft caused no adverse respiratory function, nor did it impact swallowing or vocalization. Rudimentary vocal folds covered by contiguous epithelium were easily identifiable. In conclusion, the proposed tissue-engineered approach represents a viable alternative treatment for laryngeal defects. Stem Cells Translational Medicine 2017; 6 : 677 - 687...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionThe {{association}} of {{squamous cell carcinoma}} of the larynx and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is exceptional. We report an observation of this association and present the therapeutic problems {{as well as the}} effects on prognosis. ObservationDirect laryngoscopy showed a tumor of the right <b>hemilarynx,</b> with the biopsy concluding in moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. The patient had a total laryngectomy, with bilateral lymph node evidement. The anatomopathological examination of the operative specimen demonstrated infiltration of the larynx and squamous cell carcinoma adenopathies and CLL. It was decided to monitor the chronic lymphoid leukemia, classified as Binet stage B. The synchronous or metachronous onset of a second cancer in a patient with CLL is more frequent than in the general population. The synchronous {{association of}} squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx and CLL has been described only rarely. The therapeutic strategy should focus first on the cancer with the shortest survival rate. The prognosis is more negative in an association of cervicofacial squamous cell carcinoma and leukemia than in a single cervicofacial cancer...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} of tissue cutting effects in excised cadaver human vocal folds after incisions {{with three different}} instruments [scalpel, CO 2 laser and the picosecond infrared laser—(PIRL) ] was performed. In total, 15 larynges were taken from human cadavers shortly after death. After deep freezing and thawing for the experiment, the vocal folds suspended in the <b>hemilarynx</b> were incised. Histology and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) analyses were performed. Damage zones after cold instrument cuts ranged from 51 to 135 μm, as compared to 9 – 28 μm after cutting with the PIRL. It was shown that PIRL incision had smaller zones of tissue coagulation and tissue destruction, when compared with scalpel and CO 2 laser cuts. The PIRL technology provides an (almost) atraumatic laser, which offers a quantum jump towards realistic ‘micro’-phonosurgery on a factual cellular dimension, almost entirely avoiding coagulation, carbonization, or other ways of major tissue destruction {{in the vicinity of}} the intervention area. Although not available for clinical use yet, the new technique appears promising for future clinical applications, so that technical and methodological characteristics as well as tissue experiments seem worthwhile to be communicated at this stage of development...|$|E
40|$|The current {{surgical}} treatment for unilateral, advanced glottic {{cancer is a}} total laryngectomy. Usually, the noninvolved <b>hemilarynx</b> needs resection because the resulting laryngeal defect cannot be reconstructed after adequate tumor resection. Experimental findings suggest that segments of autologous trachea may restore extended laryngeal defects. The authors used tracheal transplantation to save laryngeal function after the removal of advanced glottic cancer. In this case series review, 10 patients were treated during a 1. 5 -year period, with an average follow-up of 8 months. Evaluated factors included survival of the tracheal transplant and functional outcome {{with regard to the}} onset and quality of the airway, speech, and deglutition. The authors showed that segments of cervical trachea may restore extended laryngeal defects after initial revascularization by a radial forearm fascial flap. The fascial flap served as a vascular carrier for the transplanted trachea. Follow-up showed the stability of the reconstruction. Compared with a total laryngectomy, a striking improvement in patient comfort and function was noticed. Transplantation of the trachea is a technique that may save laryngeal function after the treatment of advanced-stage glottic cancer. These findings may improve laryngeal preservation strategies in treating laryngeal cancer. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Current {{surgical}} {{techniques for}} laryngeal exposure pose distinct limitations. To address these issues, {{this article describes}} a novel surgical technique. Our technique, termed Transventricular Chondroplastic Laryngotomy, allows for extensive and direct external access to the endolarynx. This procedure is described in both a cadaver and animal models. Three pigs were submitted to thyroid cartilage window opening without touching the laryngeal ventricle, and seven animals were submitted to the full procedure, opening a thyroid cartilage window with wide ventricular opening. the animals were sacrificed 20 days following the procedure. Prior to sacrifice, all animals underwent laryngoscopic examination and following euthanasia, the larynx and cervical regions were examined grossly, in addition to histologically. This surgery allowed for extensive exposure of the ipsilateral vocal fold and the contralateral <b>hemilarynx,</b> through the laryngeal ventricle, and thus enabled bi-instrumental handling of the vestibular fold, laryngeal ventricle, and from the anterior commissure to the arytenoids, bilaterally. No postoperative complications were observed. Access to the ventricle was easily and directly achieved through the thyroarytenoid muscle. We hypothesize that transventricular chondroplastic laryngotomy will emerge as the surgical technique of choice in patients presenting with difficult exposure and/or traditional surgical instruments are not feasible. Future transventricular chondroplastic laryngotomy clinical applications of the procedure are discussed including the resection of lesions and more complex reconstruction of vocal folds.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveElectroglottography (EGG) is {{a widely}} used noninvasive method that purports to measure changes in {{relative}} vocal fold contact area (VFCA) during phonation. Despite its broad application, the putative direct relation between the EGG waveform and VFCA has to date only been formally tested in a single study, suggesting an approximately linear relationship. However, in that study, flow-induced vocal fold (VF) vibration was not investigated. A rigorous empirical evaluation of EGG {{as a measure of}} VFCA under proper physiological conditions is therefore still needed. Methods/designThree red deer larynges were phonated in an excised <b>hemilarynx</b> preparation using a conducting glass plate. The time-varying contact between the VF and the glass plate was assessed by high-speed video recordings at 6000 fps, synchronized to the EGG signal. ResultsThe average differences between the normalized [0, 1] VFCA and EGG waveforms for the three larynges were 0. 180 (± 0. 156), 0. 075 (± 0. 115), and 0. 168 (± 0. 184) in the contacting phase and 0. 159 (± 0. 112), − 0. 003 (± 0. 029), and 0. 004 (± 0. 032) in the decontacting phase. Discussions and conclusionsOverall, there was a better agreement between VFCA and the EGG waveform in the decontacting phase than in the contacting phase. Disagreements may be caused by nonuniform tissue conductance properties, electrode placement, and electroglottograph hardware circuitry. Pending further research, the EGG waveform may be a reasonable first approximation to change in medial contact area between the VFs during phonation. However, any quantitative and statistical data derived from EGG should be interpreted cautiously, allowing for potential deviations from true VFCA...|$|E
40|$|International audienceObjective : To {{document}} the symptoms, evolution, treatment decision and outcome {{in a large}} series of patients with unilateral laryngeal paralysis after mediastinal lymph node dissection and pulmonary resection for cancer. Methods : Retrospective series based on an inception cohort of 122 patients consecutively managed at a single institution. Treatement of the ULNP relied on isolated speech therapy in 38 patients and surgical medialisation of the paralysed vocal cord in 83 patients (37 intracordal injection of autologous fat and 46 type I thyroplasty with implant insertion). In one patient a total laryngectomy was performed. Duration of follow varied from 1 - 118 month. 94 patients had a minimum of 6 months of follow or were followed until either death or recovery of motion of the paralysed vocal cord occured. Results : Symptoms included swallowing impairment and dysphonia noted in 54. 4 % and 99. 2 % of patients, respectively. Recovery of motion of the paralysed vocal cord, noted in 25. 9 % of patients referred before the sixth month after lung surgery, never occurred past this month and/or if the inferior laryngeal or Xth cranial nerves had been transected at time of lung surgery. In univariate analysis, a surgical medialisation of the paralysed vocal cord was statistically {{more likely to be}} performed in patients with swallowing impairment, severe dysphonia or paralysis of the left <b>hemilarynx.</b> When performed, medialisation of the paralysed larynx, resulted in an overall 96. 3 % and 98, 4 % improvement rate for dysphonia and swallowing impairment, repectively. Conclusions : Such results pledge for a close relationship between the thoracic and head and neck surgeon in patients with cancer amenable to lung resection with mediastinal lymph node dissection in an attempt to avoid the major complications related to aspiration and {{to improve the quality of}} life of this population...|$|E
40|$|Várias técnicas para a reconstrução da laringe, pós laringectomias parciais verticais, são citadas na literatura, algumas utilizando estruturas da própria laringe, como a prega {{vestibular}}, porém, poucas dão destaque à análise das funções laríngeas após estas reconstruções. Este estudo teve como objetivo avaliar as funções laríngeas em pacientes submetidos à cordectomia completa (tipo IV), reconstruídos com retalho de prega vestibular. FORMA DE ESTUDO: Estudo de coorte transversal. MATERIAL E MÉTODO: Dez pacientes, nove do sexo masculino e um do sexo feminino, com idades entre 45 e 75 anos, e média de 64, 5, com carcinomas glóticos tratados por cordectomias totais ou completas (tipo IV) e reconstruídos com retalho de prega vestibular, foram submetidos a videolaringoestroboscopia, onde se avaliou a permeabilidade laríngea, o posicionamento do retalho, o fechamento laríngeo, a movimentação das aritenóides e a característica da fonte sonora: vibrátil ou friccional, e quando vibrátil, a localização e as estruturas que a compunham. A qualidade vocal foi analisada por avaliação perceptiva auditiva e objetiva computadorizada. A função de proteção das vias aéreas durante a deglutição foi realizada pela avaliação endoscópica da deglutição. RESULTADOS: Os resultados evidenciaram que não houve necessidade de manter a traqueostomia no pós-operatório tardio, pois a luz laríngea reconstruída mantinha-se pérvia. A função de proteção estava mantida em todos os casos, a coaptação completa em 30 % e somente um paciente teve a movimentação da aritenóide limitada devido à imobilidade do lado operado. Evidenciaram, também, que havia fonte sonora vibrátil em 90 % dos casos e que em todos a prega vestibular participava da sua composição. Em sete pacientes a fonte sonora vibrátil se localizava na região glótica. A análise computadorizada revelou freqüência fundamental média de 177, 5 Hz, jitter médio de 1, 11 % e shimmer de 7, 04 %. Pela escala GRBAS, um paciente apresentou voz normal e 4 tiveram disfonia discreta. CONCLUSÕES: A reconstrução laríngea pós-cordectomia realizada com o retalho da prega vestibular tornou possível emissão de voz normal (freqüência fundamental 205 Hz, jitter 0, 13 %, shimmer 1, 16 %), proporcionando coaptação completa em 30 % dos casos, fonte sonora vibrátil na região glótica em 70 % e participação do retalho como estrutura vibrátil em 90 %, além de preservar as funções laríngeas de respiração e proteção das vias aéreas durante a deglutição. Several {{reports of}} techniques for larynx reconstruction after partial vertical laryngectomy {{are available in}} the literature, some of them using structures of the larynx itself such as the vestibular fold, but few have emphasized analysis of laryngeal function after reconstruction. Thus, the objective {{of the present study was}} to assess laryngeal function in patients submitted to total or complete cordectomy (type IV) followed by reconstruction with vestibular fold flap. STUDY DESIGN: Cohort transversal. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten patients, nine males and one female aged 45 to 75 years (mean age: 64. 5 years), with glottis carcinomas treated by total or complete cordectomy (type IV) and reconstructed with vestibular fold flap were submitted to videolaryngostroboscopy for assessment of laryngeal permeability, flap positioning, laryngeal closure, arytenoid movement, characteristics of speech sound source (vibrating or frictional) and, when the source was vibrating, location and structures of the sound source. Voice quality was evaluated by perceptual acoustic assessment and by objective computer analysis. The function of lower airway protection during swallowing was analyzed by endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. RESULTS: There was no need to maintain tracheostomy during the late postoperative period since the reconstructed laryngeal lumen remained pervious. The function of airway protection during swallowing was preserved in all patients, with full coaptation of laryngeal structures in 30 % of the cases and one patient presented immobility of the operated <b>hemilarynx</b> in midline position. Vibrating sound source was detected in 90 % of the cases and was located in the glottic region in seven patients. The vestibular fold flap participated in the composition of the vibrating sound source in all cases. Computerized analysis revealed the following mean values: fundamental frequency, 177. 5 Hz, jitter 1. 11 % and shimmer 7. 04 %. Using GRBAS scale we observed normal voice in one patient and four patients with discrete dysphonia. CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal reconstruction with vestibular fold flap after cordectomy was able to maintain laryngeal function, providing normal voice according to perceptive auditory or acoustic analysis (fundamental frequency, 205 Hz, jitter 0. 13 % and shimmer 1. 16 %), with full coaptation of laryngeal structures in 30 % of the cases, vibrating sound source in the glottic region in 70 % and participation of the flap as a vibrating structure in 90 %, as well as the maintenance of the laryngeal functions of breathing and airway protection during swallowing...|$|E
