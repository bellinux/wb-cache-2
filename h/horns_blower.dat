50|$|The {{battle for}} Vikingland's freedom begins in earnest, with Sir Gareth and Freia {{fighting}} side-by-side {{in an effort}} to liberate the Viking territories. Though his new troops, weaponry and spells that are at hand aren't the same as back home, Gareth begins to get the hang of them. Reinforcements of the local musicians— <b>Horn</b> <b>Blowers</b> -and the local Druids helps to bolster the rebel forces. After a few fights, the border guard is smashed and the Viking Resistance begins their assault on the Viking heartlands. Their next stop is Norsheim—center of command for the Viking Resistance and the former village of Freia's father.|$|R
30|$|Examining {{the format}} of {{traditional}} processions revealed that it portrays {{the hierarchy of the}} traditional-state security apparatus in that, the chief/king is interposed among the sub-chiefs in charge of military wing, wellbeing and protocols. This is to ensure maximum protection of the chief/king in the procession. Communicated by their costuming, the procession shows the rank of the entourage from court attendants to the chief/king. Recessions take the same order of arrangement. Both the procession and recession of a chief’s entourage is a performance art. The mannerisms of the drummers, <b>horn</b> <b>blowers,</b> stool carriers, and sword bearers announce to the audience the presence and leadership of the chief/king.|$|R
30|$|Decorated in {{traditional}} ceremonial costumes, each participating court attendant {{contributes to the}} outward beauty of the processional pomp and pageantry. Carrying the swords in their hands in a stylistic manner, the sword bearers expose to viewers the governing power and the authoritative presence of the chiefs. Stool carriers display the stools as symbolic soul of the society representing the linkage between the traditional leadership and its people. Drummers provide meaningful drum language whilst <b>horn</b> <b>blowers</b> articulate their sonic poetic message befitting {{the mission of the}} day. Depending on the occasion, traditional dancers may precede the linguist (mace bearer). They dance to lead the procession to the durbar grounds.|$|R
5000|$|The 1928 Olympics {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} the Olympic Flame. The flame burned {{for the first time ever}} in a tall tower, known as the Marathon tower, adjacent to the Olympic Stadium. In the top of the Marathon tower, four balconies are situated which were used during the Games by <b>horn</b> <b>blowers.</b> Above these balconies four speakers from Philips were attached, from which results and messages were broadcast into the Olympic area, a novelty at the time. The bowl on top which carried the Olympic flame was known to Amsterdammers as [...] "the ashtray of KLM pilots". A permanent Olympic flame burning during the tournament was also an Olympic first.|$|R
5000|$|Their {{first full}} album, Brewed in Belgium, was {{released}} in 2000. Brewed in Belgium contains seventeen old school punk rock tracks and was recorded live on tape. Three years later the band released their first studio album, called Ten Years of Bear Boots and Punk Rock. Lunatic Society started to work with The Horny Horns on the third album Punx go All the Way in 2005. The album contained subtle ska influences and enlarged the music range of Lunatic Society with a trumpeter and a saxophonist. Lunatic Society extended their work with <b>horn</b> <b>blowers</b> on Answers, their fourth full album. Answers contained songs like [...] "Strike", [...] "Disabled", [...] "Moonshine" [...] and [...] "Pendecho".|$|R
30|$|It is {{a common}} {{knowledge}} that dress is a symbolic visual pointer (Roach-Higgins and Eicher 1992) of conceptual and contextual identities. At {{the southern part of}} Ghana, the entry of chiefs and their entourage to durbar grounds is theatrically done in courtly majestic procession in order of royalty. Usually, such processions are led by drummers, mmε nsoun (<b>horn</b> <b>blowers),</b> stool carriers and sword bearers. The constituents of the processions are determined by the type of occasion, its purpose and location. Sometimes stool carriers and sword bearers are not included in the procession. Irrespective of the occasion, sub-chiefs and linguists invariably form part of a chief’s entourage. Customarily, the order of procession is done according to the traditional role of the sub-chiefs in the traditional-state. For instance the Kyidͻmhen (auxiliary sub-chief) and the Kontihen (guardian chief) directly follow a chief/king in any formal courtly procession.|$|R
50|$|Bobby J {{was born}} on June 24th in San Diego, California. He was raised Catholic-Christian and {{attended}} St. John of the Cross parochial school. He began singing for his church choir {{and was the first}} to start a band at the church. He was also the first to drum at their services. He was quickly encouraged to audition for local and touring performers by his father, family and friends. With musical talents fueling his endless abilities, Bobby J became a professional DJ at the age of 12 performing for school dances, corporate events, private clients and business like Walmart, Supercuts, <b>Horn</b> <b>Blower</b> Cruises MDR, and Jr. Seau of the San Diego Chargers. He is a Helix Charter High School alumni and was section leader of Helix's drum line, symphony, orchestra and marching band. Bobby J played football and golf alongside Heisman Trophy winners Reggie Bush and Alex Smith. He attended college for administration of justice and business.|$|R
50|$|Staff {{inherited}} many of Hugh Laing's {{roles in}} the Rambert repertory, including The Lover in Jardin aux Lilas and Mercury in The Planets, both works by Antony Tudor. He also danced in several ballets by Frederick Ashton, among them Recamier, Façade, and Mephisto Valse. For the Vic-Wells company, he appeared as <b>Horn</b> <b>Blower</b> in The Rake's Progress by Ninette de Valois and created the role of Cupid in Ashton's Cupid and Psyche (1939). For the London Ballet, he created the role of The Boy, Julien, in La Fête Ėtrange (1940), set to music of Gabriel Fauré by Andrée Howard. Other roles in his varied repertory included The Poet in Les Sylphides, the Spectre in Le Spectre de la Rose, and Harlequin in Le Carnaval, all choreographed by Michel Fokine. He also danced such different roles as Bluebird in The Sleeping Beauty, by Petipa; the Faun in Afternoon of a Faun, by Nijinsky; and Death in Death and the Maiden, by Howard.|$|R
5000|$|An early trial {{impression}} was missing the church steeple, cats, the man blowing the horn and the play-bill. In this version the dustman was missing his nose (a {{sign that he}} was syphilitic), a doll {{was placed in the}} model brick house in the foreground, and the drummer boy sported a Grenadier's cap. The drummer was handsome and had turned to look towards the little girl. By the time the print was issued this suggestion of a domestic theme with the boy, girl, and house with [...] "child" [...] had been removed. The boy had his cap removed and his handsome face turned away from the girl and replaced by features which Charles Lamb described as [...] "idiotic". The doll was removed and the girl given a rattle to add to the image of pure noise. Later copies featured a black horse in place of the white horse ridden by the <b>horn</b> <b>blower</b> and showed cross-hatching on the sleeves of the ballad-seller and the play-bill. Later impressions also made the dog and grinder darker, while lightening the cap of the sow-gelder.|$|R
30|$|Similar {{traditional}} processional format {{was employed}} {{in the design and}} execution of freestanding sculptures at the Kwame Nkrumah Memorial Park (Essel and Opoku-Mensah 2014). From the main entrance of the park, the procession starts with traditional instrumentalists (a drummer and gogi player), squatted paragon of 14 <b>horn</b> <b>blowers</b> (seven in each of the two queues) in that order before the placement of the statuesque of Nkrumah, the man at the centre of the action. Nkrumah’s coming into the top hierarchy of Ghana’s body politic at his time saw the keen incorporation of aspects of traditional stateliness such as donning of traditional costumes, drumming and dancing and other performing art in national functions. These statecrafts are part of the non-statutory cultural policy he put in place, some of which have been maintained till date. Fusing aspects of traditional cultural display in academic ceremonies is therefore a way of projecting Ghana’s cultural heritage as against the times where her artistic culture was “studied {{in such a way as}} to reinforce the picture of African society as something grotesque, as a curious, mysterious human backwater” which in the mind of Nkrumah “helped to retard social progress in Africa and to prolong colonial domination over its peoples” (Nkrumah 1961, p. 2).|$|R
2500|$|The 193 Centuries in the {{assembly}} under the Servian Organization were each divided into one of three different grades: the officer class (the cavalry or equites), the enlisted class (infantry or pedites) and the miscellaneous class (mostly unarmed adjuncts). The officer class was grouped into eighteen Centuries, six of which (the sex suffragia) were composed exclusively of Patricians. The enlisted class was grouped into 170 Centuries. Most enlisted individuals (those aged seventeen to forty-six) were grouped into eighty-five Centuries of [...] "junior soldiers" [...] (iuniores or [...] "young men"). The relatively limited number of enlisted soldiers who were aged forty-six to sixty were grouped into eighty-five Centuries of [...] "senior soldiers" [...] (seniores or [...] "old men"). The result of this arrangement was that the votes of the older soldiers carried more weight than did the votes of the numerically greater younger soldiers. According to Cicero, the Consul of 63 BC, this design was intentional so that the decisions of {{the assembly}} were more in line with the will of the more experienced soldiers who arguably had more to lose. The 170 Centuries of enlisted soldiers were divided into five classes, each with a separate property requirement: The first class consisted of soldiers with heavy armor, the lower classes had successively less armor, and the soldiers of the fifth class had nothing more than slings and stones. Each of the five property classes were divided equally between Centuries of younger soldiers and Centuries of older soldiers. The first class of enlisted soldiers consisted of eighty Centuries, classes two through four consisted of twenty Centuries each, and class five consisted of thirty Centuries. The unarmed soldiers were divided into the final five Centuries: four of these Centuries were composed of artisans and musicians (such as trumpeters and <b>horn</b> <b>blowers),</b> while the fifth Century (the proletarii) consisted of people with little or no property.|$|R

60|$|It is {{not from}} any idle wish to obtrude my humble person with undue {{prominence}} upon the publick view that I resume my pen upon the present occasion. Juniores ad labores. But having been a main instrument in rescuing the talent of my young parishioner from being buried in the ground, by giving it such warrant with the world as could be derived from a name already widely known by several printed discourses (all of which I may be permitted without immodesty to state have been deemed worthy of preservation in the Library of Harvard College by my esteemed friend Mr. Sibley), it seemed becoming that I should not only testify to the genuineness of the following production, but call attention to it, the more as Mr. Biglow had so long been silent as to be in danger of absolute oblivion. I insinuate no claim to any share in the authorship (vix ea nostra voco) of the works already published by Mr. Biglow, but merely take to myself the credit of having fulfilled toward them the office of taster (experto crede), who, having first tried, could afterward bear witness (credenzen it was aptly named by the Germans), an office always arduous, and sometimes even dangerous, {{as in the case}} of those devoted persons who venture their lives in the deglutition of patent medicines (dolus latet in generalibus, there is deceit in the most of them) and thereafter are wonderfully preserved long enough to append their signatures to testimonials in the diurnal and hebdomadal prints. I say not this as covertly glancing at the authors of certain manuscripts which have been submitted to my literary judgment (though an epick in twenty-four books on the 'Taking of Jericho' might, save for the prudent forethought of Mrs. Wilbur in secreting the same just as I had arrived beneath the walls and was beginning a catalogue of the various <b>horns</b> and their <b>blowers,</b> too ambitiously emulous in longanimity of Homer's list of ships, might, I say, have rendered frustrate any hope I could entertain vacare Musis for the small remainder of my days), but only the further to secure myself against any imputation of unseemly forthputting. I will barely subjoin, in this connexion, that, whereas Job was left to desire, in the soreness of his heart, that his adversary had written a book, as perchance misanthropically wishing to indite a review thereof, yet was not Satan allowed so far to tempt him as to send Bildad, Eliphaz, and Zophar each with an unprinted work in his wallet to be submitted to his censure. But of this enough. Were I in need of other excuse, I might add that I write by the express desire of Mr. Biglow himself, whose entire winter leisure is occupied, as he assures me, in answering demands for autographs, a labor exacting enough in itself, and egregiously so to him, who, being no ready penman, cannot sign so much as his name without strange contortions of the face (his nose, even, being essential to complete success) and painfully suppressed Saint-Vitus-dance of every muscle in his body. This, with his having been put in the Commission of the Peace by our excellent Governor (O, si sic omnes!) immediately on his accession to office, keeps him continually employed. Haud inexpertus loquor, having for many years written myself J.P., and being not seldom applied to for specimens of my chirography, a request to which I have sometimes over weakly assented, believing as I do that nothing written of set purpose can properly be called an autograph, but only those unpremeditated sallies and lively runnings which betray the fireside Man instead of the hunted Notoriety doubling on his pursuers. But it is time that I should bethink me of St. Austin's prayer, libera me a meipso, if I would arrive at the matter in hand.|$|R
