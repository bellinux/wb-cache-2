A hybrid Hessian-based and morphological linear filtering method is proposed within the framework of scale space theory. For each pixel the second- <b>derivative</b> <b>response</b> kernel is collected and formed into a Hessian matrix which undergoes eigen analysis. From there, the best eigenvalue response along with the corresponding eigenvector is chosen on different scales. Using the resulting principal directions of linear segment pixels, morphological filters are used to track and connect the linears...|$|E
30|$|With {{synthetic}} {{and field}} data, the numerical density and statistical derivatives yield a clearer reservoir radial flow regime and therefore estimate formation permeability with {{higher level of}} confidence. Additionally, there was a better estimation of individual fluid phase permeability, reflecting the contribution of each phase to flow at a given point; therefore, the formation effective and phase permeabilities can be derived with confidence. Summarily, the numerical density transient analysis DTA solution is a robust approach for interpreting multiphase flow condition which is presently limited to only numerical well testing approach. The pressure–density equivalent and numerical density derivatives can derive individual phase permeability along with good visualisation of each phase <b>derivative</b> <b>response</b> which gives the true picture of the reservoir response, and this ensures that the derived permeability is right from the formation radial flow.|$|E
40|$|At early time, {{the time}} {{derivative}} {{of the response}} of isolated conductive bodies to step function excitation decays as t- 1 / 2 (under a quasi-static approximation). One simple parametric form for the response with correct early time behavior is k'(1 + t 1 / 2 /a 1 / 2) -beta e-t/gamma. For a conducting magnetic sphere, parameter values are determined from {{the high and low}} frequency limit responses, together with two time scales taken from the form of the analytic solution. Parameters alpha and gamma correspond to transition times, for transition from an early time t- 1 / 2 <b>derivative</b> <b>response,</b> and to late time exponential decay. For conducting spheres with high permeability, increasing the permeability moves the transition from early time behavior earlier in inverse proportion to the relative permeability mu r, and increases the time constant of the late time decay in proportion to mu r. Magnitude parameter k' corresponds to the difference between high frequency and low frequency limit responses...|$|E

40|$|Injection/fall-off {{tests are}} one of the most {{promising}} alternatives to the conventional production/build-up sequence because they eliminate surface emissions and can significantly reduce testing costs. This kind of test is characterized by the presence of two mobile phases, the fluid originally in place (hydrocarbon) and the injected fluid (diesel, brine or nitrogen). The conventional analytical approach used to describe the transient pressure behavior is no longer suitable due to the variations in fluid saturations during the test. Although applicable in theory, the analytical approach often implies excessive simplifications of the real system behavior, such as piston-like displacement. Thus only numerical simulations can thoroughly describe the phenomena occurring during the injection process. However, the pressure and pressure <b>derivative</b> <b>response</b> calculated numerically often show non-physical oscillations during the radial flow phase, when the pressure derivative is expected to be horizontal. It was found that these spurious oscillations arise in convection-dominated problems and are associated with sharp saturation fronts. In this paper an effective methodology, based on an adaptive time-step calculation, is presented so as to avoid pressure oscillations. The proposed time-step selection is both computationally efficient and suitable to capture the physics of the syste...|$|E

30|$|Presented in {{this paper}} are three {{analytical}} approaches. (1) Statistical pressure derivative utilises the 2 nd differencing of pressure and time series since pressure change and subsurface flow rate are nonstationary series and then integrates the residual of its 1 st differences using simple statistical functions such as sum of square error SSE, standard deviation, moving average MA and covariance of these series to formulate the model. (2) Pressure–density equivalent algorithm for each fluid phase {{is derived from the}} fundamental pressure–density relationship and its derivatives used for diagnosing flow regimes and calculating permeability. (3) Density transient analytical DTA solution is derived with the same assumptions as (2) above, but the density derivatives for each fluid phase are used along with the semi-log density versus time plot to derive permeability for each fluid phase. (2) and (3) are solutions for multiphase flow problems when the fluid density is treated as a function of pressure with slight change in density. The first method demonstrated that for field and design data tested, a good radial stabilisation can be identified with good permeability estimation without smoothing the data. Also it showed that in cases investigated, near and far reservoir features can be diagnosed with clarity. However, the second and third methods can not only derived each individual phase permeability, the <b>derivative</b> <b>response</b> from each phase is visualised to give much clearer picture of the true reservoir response as seen in the synthetic data analysed which in return ensures that the derived permeability originates from the formation radial flow. Summarily, the three methods: statistical pressure, fluid-phase numerical density and pressure–density equivalent derivatives gave very clear radial flow stabilisations on the diagnostic plot, from which the reservoir permeability was derived.|$|E

40|$|The study expounds {{the views}} of Macmurray, Baillie and Oman on {{religious}} belief {{in the context of}} their other epistemological, anthropological and theological convictions. It is shown that each of the writers argues that religious belief is a response to a feature of everyday experience (human alienation, moral intuition and the sense of the holy respectively), that each of them takes the view that religious belief functions in order to achieve a valued end (community, willing obedience to divinely ordained duties and the on-going development of moral personality) which is regarded as both the will of God and essential to human flourishing, and that they also hold that religious beliefs may be confirmed in relation to the valued end which they aim to promote. I argue that whilst each is not without their lacunas and inadequacies, the three writers provide insights which may be useful in understanding religious belief in a Christian context. I maintain, for instance, that Macmurray's argument that religion is a <b>derivative</b> <b>response</b> to a critical dimension of ordinary experience is an illuminating perspective. Again, it is argued that there are resources in Baillie's work to help in the articulation of the view that Christian belief is a response to an a priori encounter with the divine presence in experience. Again, Oman's emphasis on the role of feeling in the disclosure of the divine is plausible, and his analysis of the nature of religious belief is particularly rich in illuminating insights. An important argument that runs through the thesis is that it is plausible to think that there are preconceptual experiences that are cognitively important. In this sense, the study aims to help underpin an experiential approach in the face of those critics who deny the conceptual possibility of such primal experiences. </p...|$|E

We demonstrate that steering the random field to the local image structure improves image denoising and inpainting performance compared with traditional pairwise MRFs. 1...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax are co-endemic in the Asia-Pacific region. Their {{capacity}} to induce and sustain diverse T-cell responses underpins protective immunity. We compared T-cell {{responses to the}} largely conserved merozoite surface protein- 5 (PfMSP 5) during acute and convalescent falciparum and vivax malaria. METHODS: Lymphoproliferation and IFN [...] γ secretion to PfMSP 5 and purified protein derivate were quantified in adults with falciparum (n= 34), and vivax malaria (n= 12) or asymptomatic residents (n= 10) of Papua, Indonesia. Responses were reassessed 7 - 28 days following treatment. RESULTS: The frequency of IFN-γ responders to PfMSP 5 was similar in acute falciparum (63 %) or vivax (67 %) malaria. However, significantly more IFN-γ-secreting cells were detectable during vivax compared with falciparum infection. Purified protein <b>derivative</b> <b>responses</b> showed a similarly enhanced pattern. While rapidly lost in vivax patients, PfMSP 5 -specific responses in falciparum malaria remained to day 28. By contrast, frequency and magnitude of lymphoproliferation to PfMSP 5 were similar for falciparum and vivax infections. CONCLUSION: Cellular PfMSP 5 -specific responses are most frequent during either acute falciparum or vivax malaria, indicating functional T-cell responses to conserved antigens. Both effector and central memory T-cell functions are increased. Greater IFN-γ responses in acute P. vivax, suggest enhancement of pre-existing effector T-cells during acute vivax infection...|$|R

Specifically, we show that for this temporal scale-space concept, it is possible to achieve true temporal scale invariance although the temporal scale levels have to be discrete, which is a novel theoretical construction. The analysis starts from a detailed comparison of different temporal scale-space concepts and their relative advantages and disadvantages, leading the focus to a class of recently extended time-causal and time-recursive temporal scale-space concepts based on first-order integrators or equivalently truncated exponential kernels coupled in cascade. Specifically, by the discrete nature of the temporal scale levels in this class of time-causal scale-space concepts, we study two special cases of distributing the intermediate temporal scale levels, by using either a uniform distribution in terms of the variance of the composed temporal scale-space kernel or a logarithmic distribution. In the case of a uniform distribution of the temporal scale levels, we show that scale selection based on local extrema of scale-normalized derivatives over temporal scales makes it possible to estimate the temporal duration of sparse local features defined in terms of temporal extrema of first- or second-order temporal <b>derivative</b> <b>responses.</b> For dense features modelled as a sine wave, the lack of temporal scale invariance does, however, constitute a major limitation for handling dense temporal structures of different temporal duration in a uniform manner. In the case of a logarithmic distribution of the temporal scale levels, specifically taken to the limit of a time-causal limit kernel with an infinitely dense distribution of the temporal scale levels towards zero temporal scale, we show that it is possible to achieve true temporal scale invariance to handle dense features modelled as a sine wave in a uniform manner over different temporal durations of the temporal structures as well to achieve more general temporal scale invariance for any signal over any temporal scaling transformation with a temporal scaling factor that is an integer power of the distribution parameter of the time-causal limit kernel. It is shown how these temporal scale selection properties developed for a pure temporal domain carry over to feature detectors defined over time-causal spatio-temporal and spectro-temporal domains.
