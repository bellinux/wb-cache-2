5|$|Biomedical {{researchers}} {{have examined the}} applications of rhodium compounds and their derivatives <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> reported one potential application for a rhodocene derivative as a radiopharmaceutical to treat small cancers. Rhodocene derivatives are used to synthesise linked metallocenes so that metal–metal interactions can be studied; potential applications of these derivatives include molecular electronics and research into the mechanisms of catalysis. The value of rhodocenes tends {{to be in the}} insights they provide into the bonding and dynamics of novel chemical systems, rather than their applications.|$|E
5|$|Cryptum {{takes place}} {{approximately}} 100,000 {{years before the}} present day in the Halo universe, {{telling the story of}} the Forerunners before their disappearance. It revolves around the journey of a young Forerunner, Bornstellar, and two humans, Chakas and Morning Riser, and how their lives change when they meet a Forerunner warrior, the Didact. The Forerunners are a type-three civilization on the Kardashev scale; they can build artificial planets and control stars. Forerunners are divided into classes by occupation, they are (in order of rank): Builders, the architects of the Forerunners' megastructures, Miners, Lifeworkers, experts <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> biology, and Warriors. Bornstellar's family are politically important Builders and particularly wealthy, enabling them to own an entire planet. Warriors introduced in this book called Prometheans were later featured as antagonists in the video game Halo 4.|$|E
5|$|Ephemerides {{with complex}} astrological calculations, and almanacs {{interpreting}} celestial events for use <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> for choosing times to plant crops, were popular in Elizabethan England. In 1597, the English mathematician and physician Thomas Hood made {{a set of}} paper instruments that used revolving overlays to help students work out relationships between fixed stars or constellations, the midheaven, and the twelve astrological houses. Hood's instruments also illustrated, for pedagogical purposes, the supposed relationships between {{the signs of the}} zodiac, the planets, and the parts of the human body adherents believed were governed by the planets and signs. While Hood's presentation was innovative, his astrological information was largely standard and was taken from Gerard Mercator's astrological disc made in 1551, or a source used by Mercator.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to practicing {{as a doctor}} for nearly 20 years at the Colored Orphan Asylum in Manhattan, Smith was a public intellectual: he contributed articles to medical journals, participated in learned societies, and wrote numerous essays and articles drawing from his medical and statistical training. He used his training <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> statistics to refute common misconceptions about race, intelligence, medicine, and society in general. Invited as {{a founding member of}} the New York Statistics Society in 1852, which promoted a new science, he was elected as a member in 1854 of the recently founded American Geographic Society. But he was never admitted to the American Medical Association or local medical associations.|$|E

The series ends in a cliffhanger, with Janie, Rita, and Nick arrested for illegally selling BOTOX at DivaStyle.|$|E

5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

5|$|While {{the venom}} {{of a few}} species is {{dangerous}} to humans, scientists are now researching the use of spider venom <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> as non-polluting pesticides. Spider silk provides a combination of lightness, strength and elasticity that is superior to that of synthetic materials, and spider silk genes have been inserted into mammals and plants to see if these {{can be used as}} silk factories. As a result of their wide range of behaviors, spiders have become common symbols in art and mythology symbolizing various combinations of patience, cruelty and creative powers. An abnormal fear of spiders is called arachnophobia.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{was born}} in Missouri and trained for {{a career as a}} printworker. He moved to Montana because he wanted an {{adventure}} in the West, but ended up staying there for the remainder of his life. At first he worked as an itinerant printer, but after getting married he trained <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> became a physician. The idea was to have a more settled lifestyle, especially after his first daughter was born, but Marquis seemed to have a wanderlust, frequently changing location and often considering a change of career (he qualified as an attorney at one point). This became especially apparent after his military service in World War I and the failure of his marriage. These moves were always within Montana, and his final location was in Hardin on the Crow Reservation close to the Custer battle site. He founded a museum there that has now been incorporated into the Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument.|$|E
5|$|On May 27, {{the governments}} of both Honduras and Nicaragua appealed for {{international}} aid. Soldiers quickly sent food and medical to at least 50 communities in both countries. A second appeal was made shortly afterwards, which proposed for $5.1million <b>in</b> <b>medicine</b> <b>and</b> other supplies. The red cross and United Nations (UN) appealed for $3million in international relief. The UN granted Nicaragua a month's worth of food supply, but officials feared that {{this would not be}} enough. The government of Cuba announced that they would send 12,000 construction workers as well as 2,000 teachers, doctors, and officials to Nicaragua. Canada donated $220,000via the League of Red Cross Societies. To prevent an epidemic of diseases such as typhoid fever, the Health Ministry started a program to give out vaccines which costs $5.1million. The U.S. Embassy in Managua provided $25,000in donations. The U.S. Embassy in Honduras attempted to outline a fact-fining mission to assess the damage and provide relief.|$|E
