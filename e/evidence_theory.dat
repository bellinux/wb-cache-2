50|$|The {{theory of}} belief functions, also {{referred}} to as <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> or Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and imprecise probability theories. First introduced by Arthur P. Dempster in the context of statistical inference, the theory was later developed by Glenn Shafer into a general framework for modeling epistemic uncertainty—a mathematical theory of evidence. The theory allows one to combine evidence from different sources and arrive at a degree of belief (represented by a mathematical object called belief function) that takes into account all the available evidence.|$|E

50|$|In {{real life}} applications, {{both kinds of}} {{uncertainties}} are present. Uncertainty quantification intends to work toward reducing epistemic uncertainties to aleatoric uncertainties. The quantification for the aleatoric uncertainties can be relatively straightforward to perform, depending on the application. Techniques such as the Monte Carlo method are frequently used. A probability distribution can be represented by its moments (in the Gaussian case, the mean and covariance suffice, although {{it should be noted}} that, in general, even knowledge of all moments to arbitrarily high order still does not specify the distribution function uniquely), or more recently, by techniques such as Karhunen-Loève and polynomial chaos expansions. To evaluate epistemic uncertainties, the efforts are made to gain better knowledge of the system, process or mechanism. Methods such as fuzzy logic or <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> (Dempster-Shafer theory - a generalization of the Bayesian theory of subjective probability) are used.|$|E

Besides, it has been proven that the quantum theory has {{powerful}} capabilities of solving the decision making problems.

When the complex mass function is degenerated from complex numbers to real numbers, the generalized Dempster's combination rule degenerates to the classical <b>evidence</b> <b>theory.</b> This generalized Dempster-Shafer <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> provides a promising way to model and handle more uncertain information.

40|$|Intuitionistic fuzzy (IF) <b>evidence</b> <b>theory,</b> as an {{extension}} of Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence to the intuitionistic fuzzy environment, is exploited to process imprecise and vague information. Since its inception, much interest has been concentrated on IF <b>evidence</b> <b>theory.</b> Many works on the belief functions in IF information systems have appeared. Although belief functions on the IF sets can deal with uncertainty and vagueness well, it is not convenient for decision making. This paper addresses the issue of probability estimation in the framework of IF <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> with the hope of making rational decision. Background knowledge about <b>evidence</b> <b>theory,</b> fuzzy set, and IF set is firstly reviewed, followed by introduction of IF <b>evidence</b> <b>theory.</b> Axiomatic properties of probability distribution are then proposed to assist our interpretation. Finally, probability estimations based on fuzzy and IF belief functions together with their proofs are presented. It is verified that the probability estimation method based on IF belief functions is also potentially applicable to classical <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> and fuzzy <b>evidence</b> <b>theory.</b> Moreover, IF belief functions can be combined in a convenient way once they are transformed to interval-valued possibilities...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Dempster-Shafer <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> is an {{efficient}} method to process uncertain, incomplete and vague information in data fusion. The combination of conflicting bodies of {{evidence has been}} one of the most important issues in Dempster-Shafer <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> since the example of counter-intuitive results produced by Dempster’s rule was found. Based on the framework of the Dempster-Shafer <b>evidence</b> <b>theory,</b> this paper provides a novel approach to handling this problem. The proposed method reapportions the mass in the null set among the other subsets that is originally assigned to the null set. Our simulations show that the proposed conflicting evidence combination method can effectively solve thorny problems such as military target identification of multisensor.

40|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>theory</b> {{provides}} {{an alternative to}} probability theory for the representation of epistemic uncertainty in model predictions that derives from epistemic uncertainty in model inputs, where the descriptor epistemic is used to indicate uncertainty that derives {{from a lack of}} knowledge with respect to the appropriate values to use for various inputs to the model. The potential benefit, and hence appeal, of <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> is that it allows a less restrictive specification of uncertainty than is possible within the axiomatic structure on which probability theory is based. Unfortunately, the propagation of an <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> representation for uncertainty through a model is more computationally demanding than the propagation of a probabilistic representation for uncertainty, with this difficulty constituting a serious obstacle to the use of <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> in the representation of uncertainty in predictions obtained from computationally intensive models. This presentation describes and illustrates a sampling-based computational strategy for the representation of epistemic uncertainty in model predictions with <b>evidence</b> <b>theory.</b> Preliminary trials indicate that the presented strategy can be used to propagate uncertainty representations based on <b>evidence</b> <b>theory</b> in analysis situations where naive sampling-based (i. e., unsophisticated Monte Carlo) procedures are impracticable due to computational cost...|$|E

40|$|<b>Evidence</b> <b>Theory</b> is {{a branch}} of the {{mathematics}} of uncertain reasoning that entails profound epistemological differences with respect to Probability Theory. In fact, its paradigmatic situation is the judge who must evaluate testimonies, rather than the gambler who must evaluates odds.

In this sense, <b>Evidence</b> <b>Theory</b> provides a formalization of some among Shackles intuitions.
