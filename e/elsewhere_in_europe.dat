5|$|Columns {{that are}} often {{deployed}} singularly, supporting plain arches and thus displaying {{the influence of the}} earlier and much plainer Norman period (Illustration 3). Columns are rarely encountered, as <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> in clustered groups acting as piers, especially in examples of early Sicilian Baroque.|$|E
5|$|During the Middle Ages, the {{geography}} dictated a dispersed economy and population. As a result, the traditional Norwegian farm culture remained strong, and Norway differed from most European countries in never adopting feudalism. This, {{combined with the}} ready availability of wood as a building material, ensured that relatively few examples of the Baroque, Renaissance, and Rococo architecture styles so often built by the ruling classes <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> were constructed in Norway.|$|E
50|$|Besides native Burundians, {{other ethnic}} groups from <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Africa, <b>Europe,</b> and Asia are also {{represented}} in Burundi {{as a result of}} immigration.|$|R

5|$|In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won {{numerous}} victories {{early on}} and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted {{the principles of the}} Congress of Vienna and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast to what happened <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.|$|E
5|$|Of the island's 300 {{inhabitants}} {{recorded in}} 2001, 283 {{were born in}} the United Kingdom (227 in Scotland and 56 in England). Seventeen were born outside the United Kingdom (four <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> four in Asia, four in North America, one in South America and four in Oceania). By age group, 85 of the inhabitants were under 30 years of age, 134 were aged between 30 and 59, and 71 were age 60 and over.|$|E
5|$|The Bronze Age {{began in}} Scotland about 2000 BCE as new {{techniques}} of metalworking began to reach northern Britain. The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued. There {{was probably a}} fall in population in this period. There is evidence of cellular round houses of stone on Shetland and wooden crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on artificial islands. As <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> hill forts were first introduced in this period.|$|E
50|$|Following Marsaxlokk's {{triumph in}} the Maltese Premier League, {{and the end}} of the player's one-year contract, Bogdanović decided not to renew and instead decided to search for a club <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> {{continental}} <b>Europe.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The stater ( [...] or στατήρ , {{literally}} [...] "weight") was {{an ancient}} coin used in various regions of Greece. The term {{is also used}} for similar coins, imitating Greek staters, minted <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> ancient <b>Europe.</b>|$|R
25|$|Heraldry in Scotland, while broadly {{similar to}} that practised <b>in</b> England and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> western <b>Europe,</b> has its own {{distinctive}} features. Its heraldic executive is separate {{from that of the}} rest of the United Kingdom.|$|R
5|$|Gilbert died in 1911, and Richard's son, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, {{took over}} the opera company upon his step-mother's death in 1913. His daughter, Bridget, {{inherited}} the company upon his death in 1948. The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company toured nearly year-round, except for its many London seasons and foreign tours, performing exclusively the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, until it closed in 1982. During the 20th century, the company gave well over 35,000 performances. The Savoy operas, from the beginning, were produced extensively in North America and Australasia, and soon afterwards in Germany, Russia, and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> and around the world.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Offenbach {{produced}} {{his first}} full-length operetta, Orphée aux enfers ("Orpheus in the Underworld"), which was exceptionally well received and has remained {{one of his}} most played works. During the 1860s, he produced at least 18 full-length operettas, as well as more one-act pieces. His works from this period included La belle Hélène (1864), La Vie parisienne (1866), La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein (1867) and La Périchole (1868). The risqué humour (often about sexual intrigue) and mostly gentle satiric barbs in these pieces, together with Offenbach's facility for melody, made them internationally known, and translated versions were successful in Vienna, London and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the album}} debuted at number one. FutureSex/LoveSounds became the biggest pre-order album in iTunes history, {{breaking}} the all-time record {{for one week}} digital sales previously held by the English alternative rock band Coldplay. <b>Elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> the album debuted at number one in Ireland, and opened at number two in Sweden and Switzerland. In Australia, the album peaked at number one and has since been certified five-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association, denoting shipments of over 350,000 units. FutureSex/LoveSounds was the thirty-fourth best-selling album of 2006 in Australia, and third in the following year.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to these seven basic tinctures, which were standard in English heraldry and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> western <b>Europe,</b> many more tinctures were used in Poland and (after the union with Poland) Lithuania, including grey, steel, brunatre, weasel and carnation.|$|R
50|$|Animalier as a {{collective}} plural noun, or animalier bronzes, is also a term in antiques for small-scale sculptures of animals, of which large numbers were produced, often mass-produced, primarily in 19th-century France {{and to a lesser}} extent <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> continental <b>Europe.</b>|$|R
5000|$|As <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Western <b>Europe,</b> {{the rapid}} growth of the Muslim {{community}} in Germany has led to social tensions and political controversy, partly connected to Islamic extremism, and more generally due to the difficulties of multiculturalism and fears of Überfremdung.|$|R
5|$|Other Italian {{folk song}} traditions are less common than ballads and lyric songs. Strophic, {{religious}} laude, sometimes in Latin, are still occasionally performed, and epic songs are also known, {{especially those of}} the maggio celebration. Professional female singers perform dirges similar in style to those <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe.</b> Yodeling exists in northern Italy, though it is most commonly associated with the folk musics of other Alpine nations. The Italian Carnival is associated with several song types, especially the Carnival of Bagolino, Brescia. Choirs and brass bands {{are a part of}} the mid-Lenten holiday, while the begging song tradition extends through many holidays throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|Ruby Blue was {{released}} in Europe on 13 June 2005 and was less successful than Murphy's work with Moloko. The album reached number eighty on the Billboard European Top 100 Albums, dropping off the chart the next week, and charted at number eighty-eight on the UK Albums Chart. It had the most success in Belgium, where it reached number seven and remained on the albums chart for twelve weeks. <b>Elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> it reached the top forty in Finland and the top fifty in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland. Echo released the album in the United States on 25 April 2006, {{but it did not}} chart on the Billboard 200.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} been found only on coastal sand dunes near Olbia, in Sardinia, where it was {{observed}} growing {{at the base of}} Juncus maritimus (the sea rush), between the winter months of October and January. However, there is speculation that it may also grow <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe.</b> Mushrooms were seen growing from both the sandy soil and decaying plants; however, as a saprotrophic feeder, {{it is possible that the}} species would be able to grow on other substrates. The mushrooms grow in close groups or tight tufts.|$|E

5|$|The vast {{majority}} of the players who have played a hundred times or more for QPR are from England, with 35 players either coming from or played internationally for other countries. Seventeen of those foreign players come from one of the other Home Nations of the UK, seven players come from <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> two from South America, two from Africa, five from the Caribbean islands, and two from North America. There are no players in the list from either Asia or Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Unlike <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> {{there is}} a {{relatively}} high proportion of semi-automatic firearms in the country, which are generally considered better suited for self-defense. The most owned firearms {{in the country are}} CZ 75 Compact and Glock 17. Other popular guns include 1911 clones and semi-automatic rifles made by Czech manufacturers, especially vz. 58 and AR 15 (of which there are 3 manufacturers). There are relatively fewer revolvers, mostly from US manufacturers such as Smith & Wesson and Colt, or Czech producers ALFA and Kora.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the early}} 16th {{and the late}} 17th centuries, an {{original}} tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed in Russia. It was quite unique and different from the contemporary Renaissance architecture <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> though some research terms the style 'Russian Gothic' and compares it with the European Gothic architecture of the earlier period. The Italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced {{the invention of the}} stone tented roof (the wooden tents were known in Russia and Europe long before). According to one hypothesis, an Italian architect called Petrok Maly may have been an author of the Ascension Church in Kolomenskoye, one of the earliest and most prominent tented roof churches.|$|E
50|$|Saint Louis IX, King of France 1226-70, is {{the patron}} saint of French haberdashers. <b>In</b> Belgium and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Continental <b>Europe,</b> Saint Nicholas remains their patron saint, while Saint Catherine was adopted by the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers in the City of London.|$|R
50|$|Sitronics (Ситро́никс) is a {{microelectronics}} {{company based}} in Moscow, Russia and controlled by Sistema holding, that also manufactures mobile phones.

50|$|The cave also yielded {{an unusual}} set of {{portable}} art on pebbles, with abstract forms that, in one case, suggested {{to the researchers}} resembled the Venus figurines found <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Paleolithic <b>Europe.</b> It was dated to the Lower Magdalenian period of the Cro-Magnon people.|$|R
5|$|Contrary to its {{misleading}} title, the Manifesto of the Sixteen {{had originally}} fifteen signatories—among them {{some of the}} most eminent anarchists in Europe—and was later countersigned by another hundred. The position of the Manifesto was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and accused them of betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout over the war, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. <b>Elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe,</b> including in the Spanish and Swiss anarchist movements, the dismissal of the Manifesto was overwhelming, with supporters being angrily denounced and marginalized.|$|E
5|$|Frederick grew {{up during}} a tumultuous {{political}} period as {{the concept of}} liberalism in Germany, which evolved during the 1840s, was gaining widespread and enthusiastic support. The liberals sought a unified Germany and were constitutional monarchists who desired a constitution to ensure equal protection under the law, the protection of property, and the safeguarding of basic civil rights. Overall, the liberals desired a government ruled by popular representation. When Frederick was 17, these emergent nationalistic and liberal sentiments sparked a series of political uprisings across the German states and <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe.</b> In Germany, their goal was to protect freedoms, such as the freedom of assembly and freedom of the press, {{and to create a}} German parliament and constitution. Although the uprisings ultimately brought about no lasting changes, liberal sentiments remained an influential force in German politics throughout Frederick's life.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue {{was not available}} in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> <b>Europe</b> asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected {{to use it to}} study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently did not agree with the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the term are unclear. In spite of the name Swiss roll, the cake is {{believed}} to have originated <b>elsewhere</b> <b>in</b> Central <b>Europe,</b> likely Austria.
