The heat loss can be estimated by various theoretical equations provided the thermal conductivity of the soil (k) and a temperature difference (Äè) between the pipes and the surrounding soil are known.

40|$|Observations {{on which}} this report is based {{were made in the}} period 1962 - 66. They were made in natural soil and water- main {{trenches}} and were done to establish methods of determining <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> penetration, paying special attention to the question of depth, of soil cover over water and sewer mains to prevent freezing. Observations were carried out at 21 stations using special probes at different depths to measure temperature and thermal conductivity, both in bare and snow covered areas. Field observations were used to verify calculation methods. A calculation method was used to determine the frost penetration for five different types of soil at varying mean annual temperatures and minimum winter temperatures. Observations showed that the heat insulating capacity of snow is less than could be expected from its thermal conductivity, mostly because the structure of the snow is continually changing. Therefore an equivalent conductivity was used which depends on the mean annual temperature. Special treatment was given to the depth of soil required over water-mains, which allows for the heating effect of the water carried in the pipes. For the frost protection of service pipes to buildings a practical method suggested is to use electrical heating to compensate for heat losses. The calculated frost penetration method compared well with actual measurements. SOMMAIRE FRANCAIS A SUIVREPeer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

Frozen ground {{observations}} {{showed that}} deep seasonal ground freeze {{has become a}} rare phenomenon in Lithuania. Since 1948, frozen ground depth has never reached more than 150 cm though according to literary data, in earlier years this <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> ground <b>frost</b> would occur from time to time. Recently, winters with short-lasting and small depth frozen ground have become more frequent. Comparison of the data obtained in the last decades with {{the data from the}} 60 ties– 70 ties of the 20 th century (when the seasonal frozen ground depths were greatest during the history of measuring) shows that <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> ground <b>frost</b> is markedly reducing. This {{can be explained by the}} impacts of global climate warming. In order to test the presumption that the reducing <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> seasonally frozen ground is related with the cycles of warm years and is a periodically recurring phenomenon we analysed the changes of the seasonally frozen ground depth since the end of the 18 th until the beginning of the 21 st century. According to the obtained results, the reduction <b>of</b> the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> seasonally frozen ground has been lasting for more than 200 years. The data also prove a cyclical character <b>of</b> <b>depth</b> variations <b>of</b> seasonally frozen ground (cycles of 90 – 100 years). However,the amplitudes of these variations have been slackening. The greatest reduction of the frozen ground depth was taking place at the end of the 20 th–the beginning of the 21 st centuries.

It was determined that the maximal <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> seasonally frozen ground varies from region to region of the country.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Subsurface {{profiles}} {{were obtained}} during airborne and surface short-pulse radar surveys along a winter roadway over the k a n a River near Fairbanks, Alaska. The roadway crossed ice-covered channels and intervening frozen channel bars. The airborne profiles were intended for ice thickness profiling but also revealed sporadic reflections from a deeper horizon beneath the bars. Later profiling {{from the surface}} recorded these deeper reflecting horizons in detail, and they were found to correspond with the base of seasonal frost, measured in drill holes. The sediments immediately beneath e frozen material were saturated and represented {{the top of a}} seasonally variable groundwater table confined and controlled by frost penetration. The profiles made from the surface also revealed reflections {{from the bottom of the}} ice and the channel bottom. However, no significant reflections were observed beneath the channel bottom; reflections from sloping horizons above and below the base of the frost in the bar may indicate alluvial bedding patterns in these deposits. Eleven holes were drilled along the roadway to determine ice thickness, water depth, frost depth and the depth to the river ice-alluvium contact. Wide-angle reflection and refraction soundings were also made to determine electrical properties of materials and to verify our depth interpretations from echo times.

To this end, the daily data of air temperature, soil temperatures at different depths, duration of bright sunshine, and air humidity were collected for the period of 1992 - 2003 for four meteorological stations of Iran including Shahr-e- Kord, Urumia, Sanandaj, and Yazd. Then, the maximum soil frost penetration depth (SFPD) for each year in the above mentioned stations was determined based on both the measured temperatures at different layers of soil and the calculated values using SHAW Model. Results of the analyses indicated that there was a significant linear relationship between the observed and the calculated values of maximum SFPD. The obtained coefficients of linear correlation between the observed and the calculated values for meteorological stations of Shahr-e-Kord, Urumia, Sanandaj and Yazd were 0. 90, 0. 77, 0. 84 and 0. 94, respectively, all being significant at one percent level.

The construction of a new structure, such and road or and airfield, changes the thermal regime of the ground leading to a faster degradation <b>of</b> the <b>frost</b> table. The heat caused by the new structure speeds the thawing process of permafrost giving place to differential settlements on the surface and longitudinal cracks along the edges of roads and highways. One of the techniques to mitigate those effects is the use of reflective surfaces.

The purpose of this Thesis has been carrying out Ground Penetrating Radar investigations in different test areas of Kangerlussuaq airport in order to evaluate the changes that the frost table is experiencing underneath a white painted surface and black asphalt.

40|$|Agricultural {{soils are}} the most {{important}} sources for the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N 2 O), which is produced and emitted from soil also at low temperatures. The processes behind emissions at low temperatures are still poorly known. To simulate the effects of a reduction in snow depth on N 2 O emission in warming climate, snow pack was removed from three different agricultural soils (sand, mull, peat). Removal of snow lowered soil temperature and increased the extent and duration of soil frost which led to enhanced N 2 O emissions during freezing and thawing events in sand and mull soils. The cumulative emissions during the first year when snow was removed over the whole winter were 0. 25, 0. 66 and 3. 0 g N 2 O-N m&minus; 2 yr&minus; 1 in control plots of sand, mull and peat soils, respectively. Without snow cover the respectively cumulative emissions were 0. 37, 1. 3 and 3. 3 g N 2 O-N m&minus; 2 yr&minus; 1 . Shorter snow manipulation during the second year did not increase the annual emissions. Only 20 % of the N 2 O emission occurred during the growing season. Thus, highlighting the importance of the winter season for this exchange and that the year-round measurements of N 2 O emissions from boreal soils are integral for estimating their N 2 O source strength. N 2 O accumulated in the frozen soil during winter and the soil N 2 O concentration correlated with the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> but not with the winter N 2 O emission rates per se.

40|$|In the Southern Alps, New Zealand, large {{gradients}} in precipitation (< 1 to 12 m year− 1) {{and rock}} uplift (< 1 to 10 mm year− 1) produce distinct post-glacial geomorphic domains in which landslide-driven sediment production dominates in the wet, rapid-uplift western region, and rockfall controls erosion in the drier, low-uplift eastern region. Because the western region accounts for < 25 % {{of the active}} orogen, the dynamics of erosion in the extensive eastern region are of equal importance in estimating the relative balance of uplift and erosion across the Southern Alps. Here, we assess the efficacy of frost cracking as the primary rockfall mechanism in the eastern Southern Alps using air photo and topographic analysis of scree slopes, cosmogenic radionuclide dating of headwalls, paleo-climate data, and a numerical model of headwall temperature. Currently, active scree slopes occur at a relatively uniform mean elevation (1450 m) and their distribution is independent of hillslope aspect and rock type, consistent {{with the notion that}} frost cracking (which is maximized between − 3 and − 8 °C) may control rockfall erosion. Headwall erosion rates of 0. 3 to 0. 9 mm year− 1, measured using in-situ 10 Be and 26 Al in the Cragieburn Range, confirm that rockfall erosion is active in the late Holocene at rates that roughly balance rock uplift. Models of the predicted <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> activity are consistent with the scale of fractures and scree blocks in our field sites. Also, vegetated, paleo-scree slopes are ubiquitous at elevations lower than active scree slopes, consistent with the notion that lower temperatures during the last glacial advance induced pervasive rockfall erosion due to frost cracking. Our modeling suggests temporally-averaged peak frost cracking intensity occurs at 2300 m a. s. l., the approximate elevation of the highest peaks in the central Southern Alps, suggesting that the height of these peaks may be limited by a “frost buzzsaw. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a description of}} the periglacial environment and features in the vicinity of Tiffindell Ski resort, on the slopes of Ben MacDhui (3001. 2 m.), the highest point of the East Cape Drakensberg, South Africa. Active and inactive periglacial features were located, mapped and described. Of particular interest were periglaciar slope deposits including gelifluction turf-banked lobes and stone lobes, and cryoturbation features including polygons and thufur. Local environmental factors, such as aspect, moisture, topography, soil texture and depth of freezing, appear to act as important controls on the spatial distribution of the periglacial features. Identification and quantification of periglacial processes in the regolith was investigated using temperature and soil moisture sensors coupled to dataloggers. Research was undertaken over a 16 month period from June 1995 to September 1996 so that comparisons between the winter conditions of 1995 and 1996 could be drawn. The Tiffindell area was observed to be characterised in the winter months by 'diurnal freezethaw days', as well as by 'ice days', 1996 experiencing colder temperatures than 1995. With more than 78 % of the days from May to September 1996 being 'ice days', and simultaneously experiencing high soil moisture contents, freezing penetration to a depth of greater than 0. 2 m was observed to occur in the Tiffindell area, causing frost heave and gelifluction. The summer thaw of ice lenses that developed in the cold winter months caused surface movement downslope of gelifluction lobes of up to 39 mm over an 18 month period, although movement declined rapidly with depth and was essentially restricted to the uppermost 130 mm of the regolith.

Spectrophotometry of Pluto in the wavelength range of 5600 to 10500 Å was obtained on four nights covering lightcurve phases of 0. 18, 0. 35, 0. 49, and 0. 98. The four phases included minimum light (0. 98) and one near maximum light (0. 49). The spectra reveal variations in the adsorption <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> the methane bands at 6200, 7200, 7900, 8400, 8600, 8900, and 10000 Å. The minimum amount of adsorption was found to occur at minimum light. A model for the surface and atmosphere of Pluto was constructed {{in an attempt to}} explain the phase variation observed. The model is based upon a previous photometric two-spot model which was constructed to explain the variations in the lightcurve from 1950 to 1982. Two dark circular spots (46 ° and 28 ° in radius, both at latitude - 23 °, separated by 134 ° in longitude) were used to constrain the surface distribution <b>of</b> methane <b>frost</b> on the surface of Pluto. The reflectance properties of the two terrains were modelled with a theory by B. Hapke (J. G. R., v. 86, p. 3039, 1981) which includes the effects of multiple scattering in the surface frost. The particle size and continuum optical <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>frost</b> particles were allowed to vary between the dark regions inside the spot boundaries and the brighter regions surrounding the spots. The transmission of the atmosphere was calculated using the Mayer-Goody band model. The model fit to the spectrum required the presence <b>of</b> a <b>frost</b> with particle sizes on the order of 1 - 20 mm in order to explain the observed phase dependence of the methane bands. Using only the atmosphere and no surface frost implies a variation in column abundance of 30 % within three days. From energy balance considerations this variation in column abundance is not possible. By including the absorption <b>of</b> methane <b>frost</b> on the surface a range of model solutions was obtained. This range yields an approximate limit of 5. 5 m-amagats to the amount of gas that can be present and still achieve a good fit to the phase variation of the 7200 Å band. If the atmosphere is removed from the model an equally good fit to the 7200 Å band is obtained. A major problem with the model is its failure to reproduce the relative absorption band depths. The gaseous atmospheric calculation on the other hand can fit the spectrum quite well. Possible explanations include a particle size distribution within a given terrain...|$|R

Potential loss of soil by erosion is high whenever a soil thaws {{from the surface}} creating a saturated soil overlying an impermeable frozen layer. Field studies were conducted to investigate the effect of surface residue on soil freezing. Residue treatments were: 1) bare surface, B; 2) standing stubble with no straw mulch between the rows, SSNM; and 3) standing stubble with straw mulch between the rows, SSM. Water migration to the freezing surface and freezing depth were partially controlled through the mulch cover which thermally insulated the soil. The SSM and SSNM treatments reduced the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> penetration {{by an average of}} 35 % compared to the B treatment, {{even in the absence of}} snow cover. During one diurnal freeze/thaw cycle the soil froze to 1. 5 cm on the B treatment; the soil on the SSM treatment did not freeze. Water content of the 0 - to 0. 5 -cm layer increased from 0. 31 at 1800 hours to 0. 57 cm³ /cm³ at 0600 hours on the B treatment. On the unfrozen SSM treatment, water content increased from 0. 34 to 0. 40 cm³ /cm³ during this same time. Soil heat and water flux during a 19 -hour freezing and thawing cycle was numerically simulated using finite differences. The model couples the heat and water flux equations at sub-zero temperatures by the change in soil ice content. An experimental relationship between unfrozen water and sub-zero temperature was used to couple the heat and water flow equations and estimate the change in soil ice content. Field measurements of soil temperature, water content and frost depth were used to validate the model. Measured versus simulated soil temperature at the 1 -cm depth resulted in an r² =. 995.

40|$|A {{physical}} {{model for the}} effective thermal conductivity <b>of</b> water <b>frost</b> is proposed for application to the full range <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> density. The proposed model builds on the Zehner-Schlunder one-dimensional formulation for porous media appropriate for solid-to-fluid thermal conductivity ratios less than about 1000. By superposing the effects of mass diffusion and eddy convection on stagnant conduction in the fluid, the total effective thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> is shown to be satisfactorily described. It is shown {{that the effects of}} vapor diffusion and eddy convection on the <b>frost</b> conductivity are <b>of</b> the same order. The results also point out that idealization <b>of</b> the <b>frost</b> structure by cylindrical inclusions offers a better representation of the effective conductivity <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> as compared to spherical inclusions. Satisfactory agreement between the theory and the measurements for the effective thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> is demonstrated for a wide range <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> density and frost temperature...|$|R
40|$|In general, frost {{generation}} on cooled surfaces have a harmful {{influence on}} prevention of heat exchange as wellas falling frosts can cause contamination of some medical or daily products. The countermeasure <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> growth onthe surfaces achieve by heating those surface by electronic heaters {{even if it}} is refrigerator. To enhance eco-friendlyelectronic devices which have heat exchanger, the surface design to prevent or detach frost from itself is highlyrequired. In the current study, micro-texturing and wettability of the surface were hypothesized to have significantinfluence on growth process <b>of</b> <b>frost.</b> Several surfaces were prepared such as a lotus leaf which is famous materialfor natural texturing, and line and space type texturing which was manufactured on the silicon wafers. In theenvironmental scanning electron microscope equipped peltier device behind of sample can generate frost on thespecimen surface, hence, in-situ SEM observation <b>of</b> micro <b>frost</b> was conducted. In the case of hydrophilic surface,frost quickly grew on everywhere with low contact angle to the surface, and then the observation area was coveredby frost. On the other hand, if we conducted same procedure to obtain frost on hydrophobic surface, the contact angletoward the surface was higher than hydrophilic one and growth speed <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> was lower than hydrophilic surface. From the observation, the frost on hydrophobic surface grew without enhancing their contact area between frost andthe lotus surface. In the case <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> grew on hydrophobic surface, the frost did not grow with widen the contact areabetween lotus leaf. To determine the accommodate micro-texture design, different width and <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> texturing wasapplied to observe, then the appropriate gap was determined between 2 to 8 m. The gap could minimize a contactarea between frost and cooled surface which could decrease adhesion force...|$|R

40|$|Frost {{formation}} {{is a common}} phenomenon under cryogenic conditions. Without effective control, frost deposition may result in serious malfunction of cryogenic equipment and systems. In this paper, an experimental study on the initial period <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> deposition and the crystal morphology and its variation with time <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> ice are carried out <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> formation on a vertical plate by microphotographics. The phase change, the initiation <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> formation and the different shapes <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> crystal at various time stages are described. It is proved {{from the present study}} that the main factors that affect frost formation in natural convection are plate temperature, air humidity and air temperature. In order to explain the frost thickness difference under various conditions, a frost thickness growth driving force is defined and compared with the experimental results. Hydrophobic surfaces are used to release frost formation on cold surfaces and the results show that these surfaces can retard the formation and growth <b>of</b> <b>frost</b> significantly...|$|R
