500|$|Morgan {{summoned the}} presidents of the city's banks to his office. They started to arrive at 2p.m.; Morgan {{informed}} them that as many as 50 stock exchange houses would fail unless $25 million was raised in 10 minutes. By 2:16p.m., 14 bank presidents had pledged $23.6 million to keep the stock exchange afloat. The money reached the market at 2:30p.m., in time to finish the day's trading, and by the 3o'clock market close, $19 million had been loaned out. Disaster was averted. Morgan usually eschewed the press, but as he left his offices that night he made a statement to reporters: [...] "If people will keep their money in the banks, <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right".|$|E
500|$|The afterlife {{experienced}} by the survivors is shown during season six. In [...] "The Substitute", Ben Linus is shown as a teacher of European History. In [...] "Dr. Linus", Ben laments his life in general, frustrated with the school bureaucracy and particularly due to Reynolds, the principal who does not care for the school. He is living with his father, Roger (Jon Gries), who is on life support. At school, he is shown to have {{a close relationship with}} his star pupil, Alex, and befriends a substitute teacher, John Locke. While studying together, Alex tells Ben that Principal Reynolds is having a sexual affair with one of the school nurses on campus. [...] Ben attempts to blackmail Reynolds, threatening to reveal his affair and citing his position as principal as the demand. However, Reynolds swiftly retaliates by saying if he makes good on his threats, Alex's chances of going to Yale University will decrease substantially, as he is requested to write her a recommendation letter. Wanting to save Alex's educational future, Ben backs down. Days later, Ben notices Desmond Hume waiting outside the school in his car for an extended amount of time. Desmond runs over Locke, and swiftly drives off. As soon as the ambulance arrives, Ben gets in and sits next to the critically injured Locke, assuring him <b>everything</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>all</b> right. When Locke returns to the school, Desmond does as well, and Ben catches him. Desmond beats Ben severely saying he was only trying to help Locke let go. Ben has a vision from his previous life during Desmond's beating. Ben believes him and relays Locke this information. When Alex sees how badly Ben was beaten, she invites him to her house where her mother, Danielle, fixes him supper. Danielle tells Ben that Alex views him as a father, and Ben begins to cry. Ben waits outside the chapel where the Oceanic survivors plan to move on together, and he sees Locke for the last time. Ben sincerely apologizes to Locke for killing him, and Locke forgives him. Hurley later comes out of the chapel and invites Ben in, but Ben politely declines saying he is not ready to move on, saying he [...] "has a few things to work out". Hurley accepts this, and tells Ben that he was a [...] "real good number two", thanking him for his help in protecting the island. Ben, touched by this, responds [...] "And you were a great number one, Hugo." ...|$|E

The English should therefore take all the money they can find and give it to the Germans.
