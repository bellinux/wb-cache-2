40|$|A {{topic of}} this {{bachelor}} thesis is "Leisure activities in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> {{the elderly in}} the city compared with the village". A theoretical part of the bachelor thesis {{is divided into three}} circuits, in the first one there are explained conceptions of an old age, ageing process and changes associated with it. The second circuit is devoted to a leisure time of the elderly and an introduction of possible activities. Last, but not least, there is mentioned a social work with seniors. A practical part is focused on achieving the defined objectives. The fist goal was to compare leisure activities in chosen <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly in cities and villages {{with the help of a}} secondary data analysis. Activity plans and their websites underwent the secondary data analysis in the chosen <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly. The second goal was to find out seniors´ satisfaction with provided leisure time activities. The satisfaction was measured through a questionnaire. The research showed that the seniors are satisfied with the leisure activities in all the chosen homes both in the cities and in the villages. Following hypotheses were established before an implementation of the research: Hypothesis No. 1 : Leisure activities in <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly in cities are comparable with leisure activities in the <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly in the villages. This hypothesis was confirmed by the research. In all selected <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly there is an emphasis on leisure activities, all <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly hold similar (comparable) leisure activities for their clients. Hypothesis No. 2 : There are no differences between an organization of leisure activities in the <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly in cities and villages, was not confirmed. The secondary analysis revealed that the <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly in the cities have more employees engaged in the leisure activities. Therefore they can devote more attention to immobile clients. Additionally there still come volunteers to those homes, who individually attend to the single clients of the homes. The thesis can be used by both by professionals and the general public to obtain information about leisure activities in the <b>homes</b> <b>for</b> the elderly in the cities and villages and a possibility to assess any differences in an offer of the leisure time activities...|$|R
