40|$|All {{users of}} the NAVSTAR Global Positioning System (GPS) located within a rather large {{geographical}} area are currently required to perform a number of identical, common operations {{in order to accomplish}} a navigation "fix" (additional "location dependent" operations are also required). Under the REFSAT concept, the common operations are performed at a central location and results broadcast via a geostationary reference satellite (REFSAT). This concept allows a considerable reduction in the cost and complexity of individual civil user terminals. The hardware design of a REFSAT/GPS receiver terminal and the REFSAT transmitter simulator is described. Since six of the Phase 1 NAVSTAR GPS satellites are now operational a demonstration test plan utilizing the one-to-two hour per day viewing window is also described. <b>Equipment</b> <b>check-out</b> preliminary test results are presented...|$|R
40|$|Payload and {{spacecraft}} <b>check-out</b> <b>procedures</b> {{followed at}} Kennedy Space Center (KSC) are described, and examples are furnished of Shuttle missions STS- 5 and - 6. Reliability must be assured {{in order to}} account for isolated operation in GEO once the satellites are released from the Orbiter. The spacecraft processing is handled in distinct flows that depend {{on the type of}} boost engine attached, e. g., the PAM-A, -D, or the IUS. Interface verification occurs in the Vehicle Processing Facility (VPF), which is equipped to store the payloads until an Orbiter is ready. Spacecraft are assigned to their respective processing lines by the Launch Site Support Manager. The STS- 5 Orbiter was fitted with Getaway Specials, the SBS-C satellite, and the Anik-C spacecraft, and STS- 6 carried the TDRSS-A spacecraft, which was mated to an IUS, three Getaway Specials, and two experiments for the pressurized cabin. The time necessary for preparing payloads is intended eventually to be reduced to 3 weeks...|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} launch a corner cube retroreflector array {{on one of the}} Global Positioning Satellites (GPS). The launch on Aug. 31, 1993 ushered in the era of SLR tracking of GPS spacecraft. Once the space operations group finished the <b>check-out</b> <b>procedures</b> for the new satellite, the agreed upon SLR sites were allowed to track it. The first site to acquire GPS- 35 was the Russian system at Maidanak and closely after the MLRS system at McDonald Observatory, Texas. The laser tracking network is currently tracking the GPS spacecraft known as GPS- 35 or PRN 5 with great success. From the NASA side there are five stations that contribute data regularly and nearly as many from the international partners. Upcoming modifications to the ground receivers will allow for a further increase in the tracking capabilities of several additional sites and add some desperately needed southern hemisphere tracking. We are analyzing the data and are comparing SLR-derived orbits to those determined on the basis of GPS radiometric data...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of a reading {{program should be}} based on objectives rather than on tasks. There are eight functions that apply to successful management: planning, organization, staffing, direction, control, innovation, representation, and communication. The R 3 C concept (reading coordinator, reading committee, reading center) is helpful to delegate the responsibilities for the reading program to individuals or smaller groups. The principal of the school should assign someone vho would have intelligence, confidence, and dedication to be the reading coordinator. The coordinator would act {{as the leader of the}} reading program. Teachers from different grade levels should be put on the reading committee to help and advise the coordinator. The school reading center would contain materials available to all teachers in the school. Its function would be to help the teachers achieve the goals of the reading program by making them aware of what resources are available, improving the center environment, and simplifying <b>check-out</b> <b>procedure.</b> The principal would meet with the reading committee to analyze needs and agree on goals, then the coordinator might begin detailed planning and other functions with the reading committee.

40|$|Check, Connect, Expect (CCE) is a {{secondary}} tier behavioral intervention for at-risk students who require targeted behavioral support {{in addition to}} school-wide positive behavioral interventions and supports. A full-time coach in the CCE intervention provided behavioral supports including daily check-in and <b>check-out</b> <b>procedures,</b> as well as targeted social skills instruction. This study extended CCE to a self-contained elementary school for students with emotional and behavioral disorders. Twenty-two students participated in the 17 -week study that involved a four week baseline phase, followed by a 13 -week intervention phase. The following research questions were addressed: (a) How did CCE affect student behavior?; (b) How did CCE affect student weekly academic engagement?; (c) How did CCE affect student weekly math calculation and oral reading fluency growth?; (d) How did severity of behavior predict student response to CCE?; (e) How did function maintaining the behavior predict student response to CCE?; (f) How did relationship strength with the coach predict student response to CCE?; and (g) How socially valid was CCE for teachers, paraprofessionals, and students? Two growth curve models were {{used to analyze the}} academic and behavioral data. Overall, students displayed significant behavioral growth during the intervention phase and positive growth in the areas of academic engagement and achievement. Severity of behavior, function, and relationship strength were not significant predictors of student response to the CCE intervention. Future directions, limitations, and implications for practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, we have {{witnessed}} great advances in {{information and communication technologies}} (ICT) and increasingly positive attitudes among consumers to embrace the Internet as an advanced commercial medium, a fact which has spurred the emergence of many innovative and interesting business models- even in the traditional sectors such as travel and tourism. This case study portrays the unique and novel accommodation concept launched by Omenahotellit (Omena Hotels), a new Finnish hotel chain which offers high-class accommodation at a rate that is significantly lower than the general price level. The company challenges the conventional- or conservative- service concept used by most other players in the field by fully exploiting the Internet and other forms of ICT in its operations. The customer books and pays for the room using the company’s proprietary online reservation system at www. omena. com, after which the room key- a 5 -digit numerical code-is delivered to the customer electronically. All doors are equipped with code locks, and all possible work tasks, including the reservation and cancellation process, are completely automated. The hotels have neither reception personnel nor a reception desk, and {{there is no need for}} check-in or <b>check-out</b> <b>procedures.</b> The business model of Omenahotellit excels in cost-efficiency by offering the core product of hotel operations without expensive built-in auxiliary services. Nearly all tasks (housekeeping, security) are outsourced, and no intermediaries are used in the distribution channel...|$|R
40|$|Work {{supported}} by the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission. ABSTR!ICT The two-mile accelerator at SLAC is an electron linac capable of producing a beam power of 500 kW at an energy as high as 20 GeV. When a high power electron beam interacts with matter, lethal dose levels can be created {{in a short period}} of time. For example, when one kilowatt of electrons produces an electromagnetic shower in 15 radiation lengths of iron, the bremsstrahlung dose rate at one meter in the forward direction is about lo 5 rad/hr. The Health Physics group at SLAC actively participates with the Research Area Department (RAD) in problems related to safe beam transport and shielding. The result of such planning and design is set forth in an operational document known as the Beam Authorization Sheet (BAS), which, along with the SLAC Radiation Rule Book, provides the guidelines through which the accelerator, beam switchyard, and research area safely operate, The purpose of this paper is to describe the planning and operational phases of radiation protection at SLAC with regards to: 1. primary electron and positron beam containment; 2. control of dangerous secondary beam areas, or ones that are potentially dangerous; 3. radiation and shielding calculations; 4. beam <b>check-out</b> <b>procedures</b> and measurements; 5. routine monitoring. Several classic examples will illustrate the ingenuity required in order to, satisfy the safety criteria established at SLAC. The information that will be presented should be of particular interest to those who are planning new accelerators,- 2...|$|R

40|$|Several {{research}} {{studies have been}} conducted on the effectiveness of check-in/ <b>check-out</b> (CICO) <b>procedures</b> in behavior education programs (BEPs). However, little research has been conducted on implementing CICO procedures specifically for special education students. This study examined the effects of CICO procedures on six junior high students receiving special education services. Baseline data of targeted behaviors were collected during {{the first two weeks of}} the third six weeks grading period. The participants were receiving special education services due to a previous Admission, Review, and Dismissal (ARD) committee decision. CICO procedures are part of a secondary level behavior support system typically found in the BEP. The CICO procedures include a morning check-in, teacher feedback on a daily behavior report card (DBRC), an afternoon check-out, and weekly parent notification of student performance. A token economy system and behavior team meetings are two components also involved in implementing the CICO procedures. Intervention data were collected during implementation of the CICO procedures during the remaining three weeks of the third six weeks grading period. The intervention was not implemented the last week of the grading period due to final exams. The CICO procedures had high social validity ratings. Reliability, limitations and implications for future research on the current study are discussed...|$|R
