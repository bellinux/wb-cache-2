5000|$|The term {{is often}} used when {{describing}} field effect transistors which rely on an electrically <b>insulating</b> <b>pad</b> of material between a gate and a doped semiconducting region. Device performance has typically been improved by reducing the thickness of a silicon oxide <b>insulating</b> <b>pad.</b> As the thickness approached 5-10 nm, leakage became a problem and alternate materials were necessary to increase the thickness while retaining the switching speed. Materials having larger dielectric constants enable thicker films {{to be used for}} this purpose while retaining fast reaction of the transistor. For example, a high-k material with dielectric constant of 39 (compared to 3.9 for silicon oxide) can be made ten times thicker than silicon oxide which helps to reduce the leakage of electrons across the dielectric pad, while achieving the same capacitance. Commonly used high-k gate dielectrics include hafnium oxide and more recently aluminum oxide for Gate-all-around devices.|$|E

The undulating back walls of the venue, which diffuse the sound throughout the auditorium by reflecting the sound waves back to the stage, account for about 90 percent of the audible sound for the audience. To prevent audience members from detecting specific sounds and vibrations including traffic noise, the rumble from the adjacent subway line and streetcar line, and even the sirens of the emergency vehicles rushing to the nearby hospitals, the theatre sits on 489 rubber <b>insulating</b> <b>pads.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractEquipment used in {{intensive}} aquaculture systems, such as pumps and blowers can produce underwater sound levels and frequencies {{within the range}} of fish hearing. The impacts of underwater noise on fish are not well known, but limited research suggests that subjecting fish to noise could result in impairment of the auditory system, reduced growth rates, and increased stress. Consequently, reducing sound in fish tanks could result in advantages for cultured species and increased productivity for the aquaculture industry. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the noise reduction potential of various retrofits to fiberglass fish culture tanks. The following structural changes were applied to tanks to reduce underwater noise: (1) inlet piping was suspended to avoid contact with the tank, (2) effluent piping was disconnected from a common drain line, (3) effluent piping was insulated beneath tanks, and (4) tanks were elevated on cement blocks and seated on <b>insulated</b> <b>padding.</b> Four combinations of the aforementioned structural changes were evaluated in duplicate and two tanks were left unchanged as controls. Control tanks had sound levels of 120. 6 dB re 1 μPa. Each retrofit contributed to a reduction of underwater sound. As structural changes were combined, a cumulative reduction in sound level was observed. Tanks designed with a combination of retrofits had sound levels of 108. 6 dB re 1 μPa, a four-fold reduction in sound pressure level. Sound frequency spectra indicated that the greatest sound reductions occurred between 2 and 100 Hz and demonstrated that nearby pumps and blowers created tonal frequencies that were transmitted into the tanks. The tank modifications used during this study were simple and inexpensive and could be applied to existing systems or considered when designing aquaculture facilities...|$|R

40|$|A simple {{alternative}} {{technique has}} been devised protecting delicate equipment against electrostatic discharge (ESD) in settings in which workers wear communication headsets. In the original {{setting in which}} the technique was devised, the workers who wear the headsets also wear anti-ESD grounding straps on their wrists. The alternative technique {{eliminates the need for}} the wrist grounding straps by providing for grounding through the headsets. In place of the electrically <b>insulating</b> foam <b>pads</b> on the headsets, one installs pads made of electrically conductive foam like that commonly used to protect electronic components. Grounding wires are attached to the conductive foam pads, then possibly to the shielding cable which may be grounded to the backshell on the connector. The efficacy of this technique in protecting against ESD has been verified in experiments. The electrical resistance of the pads is a few megohms - about {{the same as that of}} a human body between the fingers of opposite hands and, hence, low enough for grounding. The only drawback of the technique is that care must be taken to place the foam pads in contact with the user s skin: any hair that comes between the foam pads and the skin must be pushed aside because hair is electrically insulating and thus prevents adequate grounding...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} fabrication of a CMOS-compatible micro-machined Epoclad polymer on silicon (EPOS) accelerometer. The accelerometer is a grating polymer structure with a 45 μm thick Epoclad polymer proof mass and a 3 μm freestanding gap below, integrated with a silicon substrate. It is fabricated using a simple 3 -mask, low thermal budget process and features full CMOS compatibility. The device features self-aligning for the metallization step of the polymer seismic mass. It allows the accurate alignment of the moving electrodes on the seismic mass with the counter electrodes on the substrate. A post-process shadow mask metallization technique is used to define these self-aligning electrodes and <b>insulate</b> the bond <b>pad</b> connection lines. The probe station test along with the SEM inspection shows that fully free-standing devices are successfully achieved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Polymeric foams {{are widely}} used as core {{materials}} in various applications such as in cushioning, <b>padding,</b> <b>insulating,</b> structural use and buoyancy. This is because {{of its ability to}} provide high bending stiffness tied with lightweight in sandwich construction. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to investigate the strain rate effects to the polymeric foam cores under compression load. The case study included rigid polyurethane (PUR), low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polystyrene (PS) foam cores. In order to study the strain-rate dependence for these three different foams, compression tests based on the ASTM D 1621 were conducted over a range in strain rates of 0. 0001 s- 1 to 0. 01 s- 1 under the 50 kN-Instron universal testing machine. From the compression data, the stress-strain curves were produced. The results from the tests show that when the strain rate is higher, the area under the plateau region increases and higher amount of energy can be absorbed. The results also shows that the collapse stresses of the foams increased linearly with the logarithm of the strain rate...|$|R

This is because {{of its ability to}} provide high bending stiffness tied with lightweight in composite sandwich construction. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the behaviour of polyurethane (PU) foam, which is fabricated in various orientation angles. There were five different orientation angles have been studied i. e. 0 o, 30 o, 45 o, 60 o and 90 o. Three mechanical tests were performed under tension, compression and shear loads to investigate the polyurethane foam behaviour. Electron microscope was used to capture the microstructure of the specimens before and after the tests. Comparisons have been made between different orientation angles in fracture modes and mechanical properties. Deformation and failure occur during foam crushing are discussed according to experimental evidence. Since the main application of foam materials are for energy absorption, foam response under considerable compression has been studied intensively. At angle of 90 o, it permits more localised failure with high energy absorption and in contrary, 0 o which posses the lowest of energy absorption. Energy absorption for PU foam material tends to increase when the orientation of angle is increased...|$|R
