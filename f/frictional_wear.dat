50|$|The {{disadvantage}} {{of this method}} was that the chain frequently broke. This did not simply occur due to the overloading of the chain by {{the length of the}} barge train. It has been calculated that even if the chain links wore down to half their original cross-section, this force would not have led to a break. Rather the problem lay in the fact that <b>frictional</b> <b>wear</b> on the forward traction drum was much heavier than on the rear. And once the diameters of the two drums became unequal, more chain wrapped around the after drum than could be handled by the forward one. This could produce tensions both on the drums and between them that were so large that the chain links could not withstand the tensile load and their fracture limit was exceeded.|$|E

The two iterative algorithms differ in which order the parts are solved. The numerical performance of the algorithms are investigated for two two-dimensional examples. Based on these numerical results, the behaviour of the model is also discussed. It is found that the iterative approach where the thermal subproblem is solved first is slightly more efficient for both examples.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new method for measuring a two degree-of-freedom (DOF) orientation {{of a permanent}} magnet (PM) based system using magnetic field measurements. The method exploits distributed multipole (DMP) modeling method to accurately predict a magnetic field, and provides a rational basis to inversely solve for {{the orientation of the}} PM from measured data. The PM-based magnetic sensor along with the ability to characterize the magnetic field in real-time offers advantages in sensing and control such as contact-free measurements eliminating <b>frictional</b> <b>wears</b> commonly encountered in existing designs with a combination of single-axis encoders, and high-speed sampling rate thus offering a higher bandwidth than methods based on imaging sensors. This paper demonstrates the efficient method capable of measuring the orientation of the PM by implementing it on a spherical wheel motor (SWM), where the two-DOF orientation is measured. Sensor performance has been studied both analytically and experimentally to validate the DMP-based sensor model. The results can offer valuable insights for optimizing contact-free sensor designs.

The experiments were conducted using pin on disc machine at different sliding distances (0 – 40. 32 km), 15 N applied load and 2 ? 8 m s 21 sliding velocity. Interface temperatures and frictional forces were measured simultaneously during the sliding, while specific wear rates were determined for every 1. 68 km sliding distance.

40|$|Purpose: The {{main goal}} of {{research}} is determination {{of the influence of}} frictional pair „endoprosthesis head - acetabular cup” material on frictional resistance and endoprostheses wear, and the stress distribution in the elements of “bone-cement-implant” system. Design/methodology/approach: In the paper new development directions in endoprostheses are discussed with respect to construction of “head-acetabular cup” system and endoprosthesis stem, and proper material selection. The tests were carried out using dedicated simulator of the hip endoprosthesis. A quantitative and qualitative analysis of wear products was carried out. The numerical calculations of stress state in “bone-cement-implant” system were performed using ADINA System. Additionally the impact of incorrect endoprosthesis setting (jaw angle of the stem and cup) on frictional moment was determined experimentally. The stress distribution, in particular parts of “bone-cement-implant” system for selected endoprosthesis stem constructions, was presented. Findings: Both the numerical calculations and tests carried out on the hip endoprosthesis simulator gave us many valuable information on <b>frictional</b> resistance value, <b>wear</b> mechanism and durability of new endoprostheses constructions. Research limitations/implications: Preservation of geometrical, material and tribological similarity to the natural joints is of great significance in design of hip endoprostheses. Despite significant progress in material engineering not all similarity conditions were achieved. The replacement of a specific bone structure and natural joint with polyurethane insert and metal elements (stem, head of endoprosthesis), i. e. materials with much higher modulus of elasticity, cause the significant increase of the “bone-cement-implant” system rigidity. <b>Frictional</b> and <b>wear</b> processes occurring in the moveable system: “head-acetabular cup” and the resulting low endoprosthesis durability pose a serious problem. Practical implications: Future development of endoprostheses alloplasty is determined by the progress in biotribology, especially <b>frictional</b> and <b>wear</b> tests of endoprostheses.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} the <b>frictional</b> and <b>wear</b> behaviour of AlCrN, TiN, TiAlN single-layer coatings, and TiAlN/AlCrN, AlN/TiN nano-multilayer coatings in dry sliding. Comparative {{studies on the}} coatings sliding in air and vacuum environment at different speeds provided important insight {{on the effect of}} oxidation and temperature on the <b>frictional</b> and <b>wear</b> behaviour of the coatings. Among all the single-layer coatings tested in vacuum, TiN gave the lowest coefficient of friction (COF), followed by TiAlN and AlCrN. This indicated that TiN was the most lubricous coating. At 10 m/min in ambient air in which oxidation took place, AlCrN gave the lowest COF, followed by TiN and TiAlN. Among the two types of nano-multilayer coatings tested in vacuum and air, the AlCrN/TiAlN produced lower COF. The characteristics of the COF produced by AlCrN/TiAlN and AlN/TiN in vacuum and air was similar to those produced by TiAlN and TiN, respectively. This showed that the COF of these nano-multilayer coatings was governed by TiAlN and TiN. AlCrN exhibited the highest wear resistance. TiAlN had the lowest wear resistance. TiN, TiAlN/AlCrN and AlN/TiN which exhibited similar wear resistance, had lower wear resistance than AlCrN but higher wear resistance than TiAlN. In air, increasing the speed from 10 m/min to 100 m/min resulted in a reduction in COF for all coatings, except AlCrN...|$|R

One of the most common techniques to overcome this is to lubricate the surfaces in contact using an optimum amount of appropriate lubricant. Same technique is utilized in the present case to overcome the problem of <b>frictional</b> <b>wear</b> between two parallel surfaces subjected to high acceleration. The lubrication solution proposed is a modification of “Numerical model for mixed lubrication” presented in 1990 s. Present research is an extension of author’s previous work in the same.

Also in order to study the effect of temperature the viscosity of lubricant is taken for different temperatures.
