50|$|This phosphonic acid {{derivative}} (marketed by Clinigen as <b>foscarnet</b> <b>sodium</b> {{under the}} trade name Foscavir) is an antiviral medication {{used to treat}} herpes viruses, including drug-resistant cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex viruses types 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and HSV-2).

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} <b>foscarnet</b> <b>sodium</b> {{in treating}} cytomegalovirus retinitis {{in patients with}} AIDS. • Patients: Twenty-four previously untreated persons with AIDS and cytomegalovirus retinitis who were at low risk for loss of their visual acuity. • Intervention: Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either no therapy (delayed treatment, control group) or immediate treatment with intravenous foscar-net at a dose of 60 mg/kg body weight three times a day for 3 weeks (induction regimen) followed by a mainte-nance regimen of 90 mg/kg once a day. • Measurements: Patients were examined weekly until they reached the primary clinical end point, defined as progression of their retinitis border by 750 jjim or {{the development of a new}} retinal lesion due to cytomega...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2014. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract A 64 -year-old man underwent radical esopha-gectomy for cancer and simultaneous reconstruction using the gastric conduit through the posterior mediastinum. Two courses of adjuvant chemotherapy were performed. Twenty-eight months postoperatively, recurrence {{of the cancer}} was detected in the mediastinal lymph nodes, and he underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy and boost che-motherapy. Endoscopy was then performed to investigate the cause of epigastralgia, and multiple ulcerations {{were found in the}} lesser curvature of the gastric conduit. Although a proton-pump inhibitor was orally administered, the ulceration was intractable. Re-examination of the ori-ginal biopsy specimens and serological testing revealed positivity for cytomegalovirus. The ulcers began to heal after administration of <b>foscarnet</b> <b>sodium.</b> After the treat-ment, no signs of exacerbation associated with reinstitution of chemotherapy were observed...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} in vitro inhibition of hepatitis B virus DNA polymerase by trisodium phosphonoformate (PFA, INN: <b>foscarnet</b> <b>sodium)</b> and its low toxicity suggested that PFA {{could be used}} as a therapeutic agent for hepatitis B infection. PFA was also found to inhibit woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) DNA polymerase in vitro. As a model to test PFA's eventual effect, chronically WHV infected woodchucks were treated with PFA. The animals were treated twice daily in a dosage which gave a minimum serum level of PFA corresponding to an in vitro inhibiting effect on WHV DNA polymerase of about 40 %. The concentration in liver tissue was found to be 15 % below serum level. The amount of WHV particles in serum was followed by DNA polymerase assay. No effect on WHV production could be seen during 2 weeks' treatment. No change of the in vitro sensitivity to PFA of the WHV DNA polymerase was seen. These results indicate that the WHV associated DNA polymerase has no role in the production of viral particles...|$|E
40|$|Human herpesvirus- 6 (HHV- 6) is a {{major cause}} of limbic {{encephalitis}} with a dismal prognosis after allogeneic hematopoietic SCT (HSCT). A prospective, multicenter study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of preemptive therapy with <b>foscarnet</b> <b>sodium</b> (PFA) for the prevention of HHV- 6 encephalitis. Plasma HHV- 6 DNA was measured thrice weekly from day 7 until day 36 after umbilical cord blood transplantation (UCBT) or HSCT from HLA-haploidentical relatives. PFA, 90 mg/kg/day, was started when HHV- 6 DNA exceeded 5 × 102 copies/mL. Mild and transient adverse events were associated with PFA in 7 of 8 patients. Twelve of 15 UCBT recipients became positive for HHV- 6 DNAemia, defined by greater than 1 × 102 copies/mL of HHV- 6 DNA in plasma. The virus exceeded 5 × 102 copies/mL in seven patients, whereas none of the five HLA-haploidentical HSCT recipients became positive. One patient developed mild limbic encephalitis just after initial PFA administration. Preemptive PFA therapy is safe, but as HHV- 6 DNAemia can abruptly develop before neutrophil engraftment in UCBT recipients, prophylactic PFA administration from day 7 or earlier after UCBT may be needed. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|<b>Foscarnet</b> <b>sodium</b> (trisodium {{phosphonoformate}} hexahydrate) {{has been}} shown to inhibit herpes simplex virus (HSV) in vitro and to be efficacious for topical treatment of experimental HSV infection in animals. To assess its clinical efficacy in the treatment of recurrent orolabial herpes a multicentre collaborative, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. The study patients were randomly assigned to receive either 3 % foscarnet cream (78 patients) or placebo (cream vehicle) (75 patients) and were asked to start treatment at the earliest indication of a recurrence. Efficacy was evaluated in 143 patients (74 in the foscarnet group and 69 in the placebo group). There {{was no significant difference in}} time to healing or duration of virus shedding between the two groups. However, in the subgroup of patients who started treatment before vesicles appeared, the duration of virus shedding was shorter in the foscarnet group than in the placebo group (p = 0. 04), and the proportion of lesions that evolved to the vesicular stage was smaller (p = 0. 03). No significant difference in the incidence of local or systemic adverse effects was noted between the two groups. We conclude that the beneficial effect of foscarnet was limited to a subgroup of patients who started treatment in the prevesicular stage...|$|E
40|$|Human herpesvirus- 6 (HHV- 6) is a {{major cause}} of limbic {{encephalitis}} with a dismal prognosis after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT). Because our previous trial of preemptive therapy with <b>foscarnet</b> <b>sodium</b> (phosphonoformic acid; PFA) failed to prevent HHV- 6 encephalitis, we conducted a prospective study to examine the safety of prophylactic PFA administration and elucidate the changes in the plasma HHV- 6 DNA levels in the early post-SCT period. Plasma HHV- 6 DNA was measured thrice weekly from day 6. PFA, 90 mg/kg/day, was administered from days 7 to 21 after bone marrow or peripheral blood SCT and to day 25 after umbilical cord blood transplantation. Of the 10 patients enrolled, 2 dropped out of the study, 1 because of early death, and 1 with a low glomerular filtration rate. Grade 3 or greater adverse events occurred in 9 of the 10 prophylactic PFA patients and in 7 of the 10 control patients who had clinical backgrounds similar to the study subjects and underwent SCT during the same period. Neurological disorders developed in none of the study subjects but in 4 of the 10 control patients, including 2 with HHV- 6 encephalitis. HHV- 6 reactivation occurred in 3 of the 10 study subjects. The prophylactic PFA regimen was thus safe and it may reduce the risk of limbic encephalitis, but is not considered to be potent enough to prevent HHV- 6 reactivation.
