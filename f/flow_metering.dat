When changing oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> we have observed that sometimes, even with the same oxygen flow setting as before, a different S-pO 2 is obtained. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the precision and accuracy of <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> used in hospital settings. METHODS: An experimental study was performed to test oxygen <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> from a tertiary hospital, by using a calibrated flow analyzer. Used and new <b>flow</b> <b>meter</b> accuracy was tested by reading in the gas analyzer a single measurement at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 91 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and they were compared using the Student t test or Mann-Whitney U test. <b>Flow</b> <b>meter</b> precision was tested by reading in the flow analyzer 3 repetitive measurements set at flow rates of 1, 3, 5, and 10 L/min in 11 <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> and the reproducibility of these measurements was conducted by using the intraclass correlation coefficient and the Friedman test. RESULTS: the mean measured flow rates were slightly lower than the stipulated flow rate at 1 L/min, very close for 3 L/min, and higher for the 5 and 10 L/min flow rates. There was a large variability among the measurements from different <b>flow</b> <b>meters,</b> mainly at low flow rates (1 and 3 L/min). There {{was no difference between}} new and used <b>flow</b> <b>meters</b> at the <b>flow</b> rates measured, except at 10 L/min. <b>Flow</b> <b>meters</b> precision analysis showed a good reproducibility in 3 repetitive measurements for each flow rate (minimum 0. 95, maximum 0. 99 intraclass correlations).
