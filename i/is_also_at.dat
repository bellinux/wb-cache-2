5|$|Flowering {{begins in}} February {{and is usually}} {{finished}} {{by the end of}} June. The species has an unusually low rate of flowering: even at the peak of its flowering season, it averages less than seven inflorescences per plant flowering at any one time. Individual flowers open sequentially from bottom to top within each inflorescence, the rate varying with the time of day: more flowers open during the day than at night, with a peak rate of around two to three florets per hour during the first few hours of daylight, when honeyeater foraging <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>at</b> its peak.|$|E
5|$|Following work by {{the breed}} clubs to ensure that any reoccurring health {{problems}} are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>at</b> slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E
5|$|On an {{examining}} table, {{one of the}} kidnappers, Eric Swan (James Marsters), strips Taylor, harshly washes {{her with}} a course brush, and photographs her. The picture is sent to Watts, who is seen looking at it while supervising the crime scene. Black <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>at</b> the scene, and experiences a vision of Operation Desert Storm. Evidence is found of military-style tyre and boot tracks; these lead the FBI to an address where they find the second kidnapper murdered—Black and Watts clash over whether the Group or Swan are responsible. Back in the examination room, Swan exposes Taylor to a substance contained in a canister.|$|E

5|$|Points {{and lines}} {{may be viewed}} as special cases of circles; a point can be {{considered}} as a circle of infinitely small radius, and a line may be thought of an infinitely large circle whose center <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>at</b> infinity. From this perspective, the general Apollonius problem is that of constructing circles tangent to three given circles. The nine other cases involving points and lines {{may be viewed as}} limiting cases of the general problem. These limiting cases often have fewer solutions than the general problem; for example, the replacement of a given circle by a given point halves the number of solutions, since a point can be construed as an infinitesimal circle that is either internally or externally tangent.|$|E

The Coast Guard picks up an unidentified man floating in the Bermuda Triangle and pleading to warn Orin. Lt. Torres is sent to investigate the area.
