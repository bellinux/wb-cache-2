5|$|Insurance {{coverage}} helps save lives, {{by encouraging}} <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> {{and prevention of}} dangerous medical conditions. According to a 2014 study, the ACA likely prevented an estimated 50,000 preventable patient deaths from 2010 to 2013. City University public health professors David Himmelstein and Steffie Woolhandler wrote in January 2017 that a rollback of the ACA's Medicaid expansion alone would cause an estimated 43,956 deaths annually.|$|E

5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening {{those at}} high risk, <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> {{and treatment of}} cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine.

5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a genetic disease that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a genetic disease such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. It is hoped that vaccination efforts and <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E
5|$|Research on <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> is ongoing. For instance, the European Registry of Hereditary Pancreatitis and Familial Pancreatic Cancer (EUROPAC) {{trial is}} aiming to {{determine}} whether regular screening is appropriate for people with {{a family history of}} the disease, or who have hereditary pancreatitis. The knowledge that new onset of diabetes can be an early sign of the disease could facilitate timely diagnosis and prevention if a workable screening strategy can be developed.|$|E

5|$|Long-term use of {{linezolid}} {{has also}} been associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include thalidomide, the epothilones such as ixabepilone, the vinca alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine, the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel, the proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib, and the platinum-based drugs cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin. and optic neuropathy, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, mitochondrial toxicity has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to mitochondria, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial ribosomes. Lactic acidosis, a potentially life-threatening buildup of lactic acid in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly complete blood counts during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed {{by a team of}} researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and liver function tests; measurement of serum lactate levels, for <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may interact with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} change detectable on laboratory investigations {{is a low}} {{white blood}} cell count, which may then be followed by low platelets and metabolic acidosis. A moderately elevated level of aminotransferase (AST and ALT) from the liver is commonly associated with low platelets and white blood cells. In severe disease, plasma leakage results in hemoconcentration (as indicated by a rising hematocrit) and hypoalbuminemia. Pleural effusions or ascites can be detected by physical examination when large, but the demonstration of fluid on ultrasound may assist in the early identification of dengue shock syndrome. The use of ultrasound is limited by lack of availability in many settings. Dengue shock syndrome is present if pulse pressure drops to ≤20mmHg along with peripheral vascular collapse. Peripheral vascular collapse is determined in children via delayed capillary refill, rapid heart rate, or cold extremities. While warning signs are an important aspect for <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> of potential serious disease, the evidence for any specific clinical or laboratory marker is weak.|$|E

30|$|We {{incorporate}} the <b>early</b> zero-block <b>detection</b> technique into the UMHexagonS algorithm, {{which has already}} been adopted in H. 264 /AVC JM reference software, {{to speed up the}} motion estimation process. A nearly sufficient condition is derived for <b>early</b> zero-block <b>detection.</b> Although the conventional <b>early</b> zero-block <b>detection</b> method can achieve significant improvement in computation reduction, the PSNR loss, to whatever extent, is not negligible especially for high quantization parameter (QP) or low bit-rate coding. This paper modifies the UMHexagonS algorithm with the <b>early</b> zero-block <b>detection</b> technique to improve its coding performance. The experimental results reveal that the improved UMHexagonS algorithm greatly reduces computation while maintaining very high coding efficiency.|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of the 2012 {{outbreak}} of meningitis in the U.S, very little was known about E. rostratum including methods for diagnosing and treating infected individuals. Only 30% of 372 patient specimens sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed PCR evidence of the fungal infection. β-D-glucan assays were suggested as a potential method for <b>early</b> <b>detection.</b> The β-D-glucan assay detects (1,3)-β-D-glucan, a major component of many fungal cell walls released during cell growth. In the case of a 44-year-old man, the galactomamman assay successfully facilitated <b>early</b> <b>detection</b> of E. rostratum.

In this study, {{the impact of}} RNA integrity, gene-specific reverse transcription and targeted cDNA preamplification was quantified in terms of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) sensitivity by measuring 48 protein coding genes on eight duplicate cultured cancer cell pellet FFPE samples and twenty cancer tissue FFPE samples. More intact RNA modestly increased gene detection sensitivity by 1. 6 fold (<b>earlier</b> <b>detection</b> by 0. 7 PCR cycles, 95 % CI = 0. 593 - 0. 850). Application of gene-specific priming instead of whole transcriptome priming during reverse transcription further improved RT-qPCR sensitivity by a considerable 4. 0 fold increase (<b>earlier</b> <b>detection</b> by 2. 0 PCR cycles, 95 % CI = 1. 73 - 2. 32). Targeted cDNA preamplification resulted in the strongest increase of RT-qPCR sensitivity and enabled <b>earlier</b> <b>detection</b> {{by an average of}} 172. 4 fold (7. 43 PCR cycles, 95 % CI = 6. 83 - 7. 05). We conclude that gene-specific reverse transcription and targeted cDNA preamplification are adequate methods for accurate and sensitive RT-qPCR based gene expression analysis of FFPE material.
