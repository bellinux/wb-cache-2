40|$|After an {{introductory}} chapter come twelve chapters, multi-authored, {{divided into three}} sections: Pedagogy as Authorship, <b>emphasising</b> the pupils/students as authors of their new understanding; Pedagogy as Answerability, <b>emphasising</b> the exchange of ideas through dialogue; and Pedagogy as Chronotope, <b>emphasising</b> real/fictional time-place relationships. The chapters will be described {{in the second half}} of this review. It is a useful book, which I recommend...|$|R

5|$|Also {{like her}} mother, whose Letters from Sweden was {{foundational}} {{to the writing}} of both History of a Six Weeks' Tour and Rambles, Shelley <b>emphasised</b> her maternal role in the text. She describes herself as a conventional figure, worrying about her son. Rather than the scandal-ridden young woman of her youth, which she wrote about in the Tour, she is now a demure, respectable, middle-aged woman.|$|E
5|$|Amis drew upon {{a holiday}} {{he had taken}} in the Greek islands to create a {{realistic}} Greek setting and characters. He <b>emphasised</b> political intrigue in the plot more than Fleming had done in the canonical Bond novels, also adding revenge to Bond's motivations by including M's kidnapping. Despite keeping a format and structure similar to Fleming's Bond novels, Colonel Sun was given mixed reviews.|$|E
40|$|We find UK {{investors and}} {{entrepreneurs}} are significantly concordant in rankings of investments and key factors for risk but significantly discordant on risk classes. Investors <b>emphasise</b> agency risk (e. g., motivation, empowerment, alignment), and entrepreneurs <b>emphasise</b> business risk (e. g., market opportunities) ...|$|R
40|$|Internationally {{literature}} <b>emphasises</b> concern {{regarding the}} phenomenon of violence and aggression within the emergency field. This paper <b>emphasises</b> the important role education and training may play in {{reducing the risk of}} staff being exposed to violent or aggressive experiences. Furthermore, the paper <b>emphasises,</b> explores and discusses well recognised theories relating to aggression development. These theories can be used to explain both organisational strategies designed to minimise aggression in the emergency department and situational factors contributing to the development of aggressive interactions...|$|R

5|$|Blackstone's Ratio is a maxim of English law, {{having been}} {{established}} as such {{within a few}} decades of Blackstone's work being published. It is also cited in courts and law in the US, and is strongly <b>emphasised</b> to American law students.|$|E
5|$|Her {{approach}} to religious piety {{differed from the}} approach of her predecessors, as she was influenced by Jansenist ideas. The empress actively supported conversion to Roman Catholicism by securing pensions for converts. She tolerated Greek Catholics and <b>emphasised</b> their equal status with Roman Catholics.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{of science}} have noted that, while Darwin {{considered}} the ideas in Wallace's paper to be {{essentially the same}} as his own, there were differences. Darwin <b>emphasised</b> competition between individuals of the same species to survive and reproduce, whereas Wallace <b>emphasised</b> environmental pressures on varieties and species forcing them to become adapted to their local conditions, leading populations in different locations to diverge. Some historians, notably Peter J. Bowler, have suggested the possibility that in the paper he mailed to Darwin, Wallace was not discussing selection of individual variations at all but rather group selection. However, Malcolm Kottler has shown that this notion is incorrect and Wallace was indeed discussing individual variations.|$|E

50|$|People {{change their}} {{stereotype}} of their ingroups and outgroups to suit context. People {{are likely to}} self-stereotype their ingroup as homogenous in an intergroup context, and {{they are less likely}} to do so in an intragroup context where the need to <b>emphasise</b> their group membership is not as great. Stereotypes can <b>emphasise</b> a person’s group membership in two steps: First, stereotypes <b>emphasise</b> the person’s similarities with ingroup members on relevant dimensions, and also the person’s differences from outgroup members on relevant dimensions. Second, the more the stereotypes <b>emphasise</b> within-group similarities and between-group differences, the more salient the person’s social identity becomes, and the more depersonalised that person is. A depersonalised person abandons individual differences and embraces the stereotypes associated with their relevant group membership.|$|R

5|$|In the Vaikom Satyagraha of 1924, Periyar and Gandhi both cooperated and confronted {{each other}} in socio-political action. Periyar and his {{followers}} <b>emphasised</b> the difference in point of view between Gandhi and himself on the social issues, such as fighting the Untouchability Laws and eradication of the caste system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the {{dismissal}} of Lieutenant General Sydney Rowell for insubordination, Blamey ordered Herring to join him in Port Moresby as the new commander of I Corps. Before departing, Herring met with General Douglas MacArthur, who <b>emphasised</b> that the first duty of a soldier was obedience to his superiors.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse <b>emphasised</b> that Keynesian theory shouldn't {{be applied}} to {{underdeveloped}} countries because they don't face a lack of effective demand {{in the way that}} developed countries do. Their problem is to do with a lack of real purchasing power due to low productivity levels. Thus, merely increasing the supply of money will not expand the market but will in fact cause inflationary pressure.|$|E

Tapestry shows its threads as part of its beauty: a picture annihilates its canvas: it shows nothing of it. Porcelain <b>emphasises</b> its glaze: water-colours reject the paper.|$|R

5|$|One of {{the primary}} morals of Barbauld's lessons is that {{individuals}} {{are part of a}} community; in this she was part of a tradition of female writing that <b>emphasised</b> the interconnectedness of society. Charles, the hero of the texts, explores his relationship to nature, to animals, to people, and finally to God.|$|E
5|$|Periyar {{felt that}} {{a small number of}} cunning people created caste distinctions to {{dominate}} over society, so he <b>emphasised</b> that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that caste system had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive {{to get rid of this}} menace.|$|E

In late 1999, Zamfara <b>emphasised</b> its use, with eleven other northern states following suit. These states are Kano, Katsina, Niger, Bauchi, Borno, Kaduna, Gombe, Sokoto, Jigawa, Yobe, and Kebbi.|$|E

5|$|State Shinto {{was heavily}} <b>emphasised</b> in the 1930s {{as a means}} to promote Japanese {{nationalism}} and acculturalisation of Palauans to Japanese norms. A few shrines were built around Palau during the 1930s. Of particular note was the completion of the Taisha Nanyo Jinja (transliterally the Great Southern Shrine) in November 1940 at Koror, which subsequently served as the central shrine in Micronesia. Civilian participation of Shinto rituals was heavily <b>emphasised,</b> which focused on Japanese cultural ideals and worship of the Japanese emperor. Shinto, Zen Buddhist and Tenrikyo missions were also encouraged to establish religious missions, and the first Buddhist temple in Palau was erected in 1926, mainly to cater to the spiritual needs of the Japanese settlers. Early Japanese settlers reportedly built small Shinto shrines in agricultural colonies before the civilian government actively encouraged religious missionary activities in Palau.|$|E
5|$|The Germans <b>emphasised</b> that al-Husayni {{had flown}} from Berlin to Sarajevo {{in order to}} bless and inspect the division. During his visit to Bosnia al-Husayni also {{convinced}} some important Muslim leaders that {{the formation of the}} division was in the interests of Islam.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial {{government}} {{wanted to}} reform the church and appointed a series of well educated, reforming bishops. Although these bishops agreed with the government {{on the need to}} reform, they did not share Pedro II's views on the subservience of the Church to government and tended to be influenced by Ultramontanism which <b>emphasised</b> loyalty to the Papacy over loyalty to the civil powers.|$|E
