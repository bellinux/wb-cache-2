As president of the newly formed Elizabethtown, Lexington, and Big Sandy Railroad company, he secured financial backing from Collis Potter Huntington for a railroad connecting Elizabethtown and Lexington to the Big Sandy River as part of a route linking those cities with the Atlantic Ocean. When Huntington invested in June 1871, he became president of the company, and Breckinridge became vice-president.

5|$|Much of Van Rensselaer's {{early life}} is unknown to today's historians, though in March 1608 {{it has been}} {{recorded}} that he {{was taking care of}} some business of Van Bijler in Prague. It seems Van Bijler gradually retired from his business, leaving it in the control of Van Rensselaer. During his tenure at the helm of his uncle's business, Van Rensselaer proposed a merger with the firm of Jan van Wely, son of one of Van Bijler's sisters, who had an equally successful jewelry business. The firms combined under the name of Jan van Wely & Co. in February 1614. Van Rensselaer's name {{was not included in the}} name of the new company, since he contributed only one eighth of the <b>investment</b> <b>capital,</b> whereas van Wely contributed half (192,000 guilders). In 1616, van Wely was called on by Prince Maurice to meet at the Hague for a sale in jewels. He was murdered while waiting to meet with the Prince. The firm's contract stipulated that at the death of Jan van Wely, the remaining members of the firm should continue the partnership for another six years. Van Wely's murder, therefore, caused no change in the business, but it seems that at the expiration of that time, Van Rensselaer began again on his own account, founding Kiliaen van Rensselaer & Co. with partner Jacques I'Hermite.|$|E
40|$|Various {{authors have}} scrutinised the sole {{utilisation}} of quantifiable (financial) appraisal criteria in <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> appraisal.

Semi-structured interviews were held with strategic <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> decision-makers within a major role player in the platinum industry. Respondents were selected according to the snowball sampling method. An analysis of the results indicates that competitive strategy does influence the <b>capital</b> <b>investment</b> process.

Following the underlying assumptions of the endogenous growth model, real output is regressed on private <b>capital</b> <b>investment,</b> government human <b>capital</b> <b>investment,</b> human <b>capital</b> consumption, and openness to trade.
