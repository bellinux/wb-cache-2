40|$|To {{reduce costs}} and limit {{pollution}} from {{transportation of goods}} by sea, a method for optimization of the propulsive efficiency of an 8000 dead weight tonnage tanker is investigated. Emphasis is put on {{the interaction between the}} propulsion system and the hull. The optimum combination of pitch and propeller rate of revolutions is sought for a controllable pitch propeller, working behind a tanker. Two stern shapes have been examined at the vessel&# 146;s design speed, and in bollard pull condition. The optimization study was carried out on the hull with lowest resistance. All investigations are done in model scale. The optimization is done both numerically and experimentally. In the software SHIPFLOW, a zonal approach is used to simulate the flow around the ship. That is, the flow regime is divided into a potential-, a boundary layer- and a complete viscous-region. A lifting line propeller model is iteratively coupled to the viscous flow solver, for the self-propulsion simulation. Resistance-, propeller open water- and propulsion- tests are carried through in MARINTEKs towing tank, in Trondheim. The resistance test for one stern shape was repeated four times to determine the uncertainty in the measurements. All the tests were done at <b>design</b> <b>draught</b> in calm water. Five propeller pitch settings was tested around the design pitch, at three propeller loadings. The experimental results in terms of power, shows some degree of scatter. The lack of repeated tests for the propulsion case makes the uncertainty unquantifiable. There seems to be a trend that the higher pitch ratios perform better than the low pitch settings, for all propeller loadings tested. From the SHIPFLOW simulations it is found that the pitch/diameter= 0. 77 (P/D= 0. 77) (design P/D= 0. 87) performs best, by 0. 5 % better than P/D= 0. 67. It is seen that the thrust deduction increases with increasing P/D. This opposes the trends from the experiment. The maximum number of iterations was reached for the viscous flow solver, so the solution is not fully converged. The validation of the simulated results against the experiment is inconclusive. To limit and quantify the uncertainty, repeated propulsion tests is recommended. The simulation method used in this thesis looks promising, but further verification is needed. An interesting continuation of the work done in this project, would be to do the simulations in full scale, with a corresponding full scale validation trial. </p...|$|E
40|$|When a {{ship-owner}} {{orders a}} vessel from a shipyard, a contract is written to confirm and guarantee the agreement for both parts. An important {{requirement of the}} contract is the vessel's speed at a given engine power, RPM and draught, in "ideal" conditions (i. e. calm, infinitely deep and current free water, with smooth hull and propeller surfaces at with no wind and zero drift and rudder angle). The speed capacity of the recently built ship is measured carrying out a speed trial. It is rarely possible to perform the trial under ideal, contractual conditions, and the speed will normally be reduced by environmental factors. Whenever the test is carried out in conditions deviating from those contractually specified, the speed must be corrected for, to best coincide with the contractual stipulations. These corrections can be of significant magnitude and are of great economic importance. Penalties of considerable size are given to shipyards that fail to deliver {{in accordance with the}} contract. There are various standards published providing guidelines regarding the execution of speed trials, the measurements that are to be performed during the trials and corrections for environmental factors that are to be made in retrospect. ISO (2002), Perdon (2002), Bose (2005) and B. Henk (2006) were chosen for evaluation and comparison in this thesis. The recommendations of the standards are occasionally disagreeing. The main resistance contribution is claimed to be wind and wave (Bose (2005) and B. Henk (2006)). B. Henk (2006)) states; "these corrections (small displacement deviations, shallow water, and salinity deviations) are relatively small compared to wind and wave directions". Reinertsen (2011) suspects that the added wave resistances calculated by the Hyundai shipyard are too large. This assumption is based on Haugan (2011) 's (employee of KGJS) mean wave load calculations that generally gave results 30 % lower than those found by Hyundai. An unrealistically large correction factor for wave resistance is most definitely advantageous for the shipyard. This will give a higher calculated contractual speed, and the shipyard is consequently more likely to meet the contractual requirements. The Hyundai shipyard's correction procedures were evaluated based on the relevant standards. The shipyard neglects all resistance components, but the added resistance due to wind and waves (they also correct for large discrepancies between the trim/draught obtained at speed trial and that contractually stipulated. This is however not relevant for tankers, as these generally are capable of achieving <b>design</b> <b>draught</b> at the sea trial). This is consistent with the recommendations of Perdon (2002) and B. Henk (2006). The shipyard does not have the speed trials conducted in head - or following waves, nor head - or following wind. B. Henk (2006) and Perdon (2002) underline the importance of executing the speed trials in head - or following waves. Perdon (2002) argues; "in the case when the waves do not come from the bow or the stern the correction methods are not sufficiently reliable and the effects of steering and drift on the ship's performance may be underestimated". ISO (2002) recommends performing the trials in head and following wind (note that there usually is a correlation between true wind - and wave direction). The Hyundai shipyard assumes that the wave direction with respect to the ship's centerline equals the relative wind angle. This conflicts with the recommendations of the standards. They advise to obtain the wave direction by visual observations or instruments such as buoys or sea wave analysis radars. Furthermore, Hyundai's assumption is highly illogical from a scientific standpoint. In this thesis, the added wave resistance (due to diffraction) was computed by a handful of methods proposed in the literature. The computed values obtained in this report were all substantially larger than those found by Hyundai. This denies Reinertsen (2011) 's suspicion of Hyundai's correction factors for wave resistance being unrealistically high. B. Henk (2006) emphasizes the importance of accounting for the location of the anemometer in the computations of added resistance due to wind. This is not done by the shipyard. B. Henk (2006) proposes a formula for correction of improper placements of the anemometer. In this thesis, the added wind resistance was calculated, including this correction. The added resistance found was 28 % smaller than the value obtained by Hyundai. This is relevant as the wind tends to be a key resistance contribution. Finally, the Energy Efficiency Design Index (EEDI) has been described. The EEDI estimates a ship's CO 2 emission per ton-mile of goods transported; put differently, the vessel's impact on the environment in relation to its benefit for society. The EEDI is to be implemented for all new ships, 1 st of January 2013. The value of this index will be determined based on results from speed trials. </p...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to determine the design of an autonomous ferry to transport people between Ravnkloa and Fosenkaia in Trondheim. It will also be considered whether or not it will be a better solution than a bridge. The operational area of the ferry is limited to the 100 metres stretch between the two docks. The ferry should not require any personnel on board to operate, but it is assumed that a supervisor can oversee the operations from a land base. The surrounding elements of the system was outlined for easy adaptation, but not designed to full detail due to time limitations. The autonomous system itself was not considered directly as it is outside the team members area of expertise. The work in this thesis follows the System Based Ship Design (SBSD) methodology, combined with the Risk Based Ship Design (RBSD) method. In order to apply both methods simultaneously, they were slightly adapted to fit the design study. A bigger emphasis has been put on the functional analysis in the SBSD approach. This makes it easier to determine a good solution for the design. The design study initiates with the mission statement, and sets the main functional requirements for the design based on this. Both relevant generic- and safety related functional requirements were set according to the main functions. The safety related functions were determined by performing a formal safety assessment. To reveal all possible solutions to the functional requirements, a brainstorming session was performed. The alternatives were continuously evaluated against relevant framework conditions and the least relevant ones excluded, thus limiting the final solution throughout the design process. The required area and volume on board, determined using model- and life size test, determined the initial main dimensions. The final design was evaluated on technical performance, economy and safety performance. Stability- strength- and resistance calculations were used to verify the design, in addition to determining the life cycle costs (LCC). The result of this study is the design of an autonomous ferry with electrical power supply and a ramp used for mooring and entrance. The ferry is 9 m long with a beam of 4 m. The <b>design</b> <b>draught</b> of the vessel is 0. 515 m. The ferry can transport up to 12 passengers, including three wheelchairs, and 30 kg luggage per person. There is also room for twelve bicycles on board. The building material is aluminium. The ferry superstructure is semi - open with two broad pillars supporting the roof. The ferry will dock at piers separated from other docks in the area. An information poster is located at the dock to inform passengers on relevant safety issues. The registration gates lock of the docking area to the people on the dock. Entry to the dock is done using a gangway. The design ensures that the passenger comfort is sufficiently good. The ferry is able to transport all types of pedestrians, and is thus able to substitute a bridge. The weakness of the ferry option is that passengers may need to wait a few minutes to use the ferry. The ferry's life cycle costs were estimated at approximately NOK 2. 4 million over 15 years. This is significantly lower than the price tag for the bridge, estimated at NOK 42 million. Thus, the the ferry is considered a good alternative. All functional requirements set to the design are considered fulfilled to a reasonable degree. The methods applied for the design have weaknesses. Flaws in the RBSD methodology include a lack of accurate statistical information, the fact that the method is based on analysis of existing vessels, and that it is dependent on predetermined risk acceptance criteria. Flaws in the SBSD methodology include non existing statistical information on small and/or autonomous vessels. Required space for all systems was therefore set using existing equipment. Another flaw is that functional requirements may not cover all actual requirements for the vessel. For instance, bollards and ropes are required on board in case towing is necessary, but is not covered by any functional requirements. The iterative nature of the design process indicate several relevant tasks for the further project work. It will be relevant to consider all aspects set by regulations. New aspects for consideration include design of land based dock systems and determination of access restrictions, required safety level, disclaimer of liability and technical requirements for autonomous vessels. Several aspects on board the vessel are also relevant. This includes heating cables in the ferry roof and main deck, verification of plate thickness, hull adaptation for welding and design of bicycle racks. The operational plan for the battery systems should be determined for the ferry operation to run as smoothly as possible. Finally, the damage stability for the vessel should be verified...|$|E

The empirical findings in this thesis support the view that technical workers in Australia using CADCAM are engineering and trades people who have used their knowledge and skills to become CADCAM users. The data also supports the view that in the main technical workers have relatively secure jobs with good status and prestige. Technical workers have used their knowledge of the design and production processes to ensure that their jobs are located in a secure tier of the primary segment of an internal labour market..

25|$|Within a {{few years}} of the {{introduction}} of the A2 class 4-6-0 in 1907, it was clear that increasingly heavy train loads would require a more powerful locomotive on principal main lines. From as early as 1918, a series of drawings for potential 4-6-2 'Pacific' type locomotives began to emerge from the VR's Locomotive Design Section, some of which were ultimately developed into the 3 cylinder S class heavy Pacific of 1928. However, plans for a smaller 2 cylinder Pacific, with an axle load below 20 tons to allow operation across the VR mainline network, were put on hold during the 1930s.

A painter judging of some admirable piece may affirm with certainty that it was of Holbein or Vandyck; but vulgar <b>designs</b> and common <b>draughts</b> are easily mistaken and misapplied. Thus, by my long study of your lordship, I am arrived at the knowledge of your particular manner. In the good poems of other men, like those artists, I can only say, [...] "This is like the draught of such a one, or like the colouring of another;" [...] in short, I can only be sure that it is the hand of a good master: but in your performances it is scarcely possible for me to be deceived. If you write in your strength, you stand revealed at the first view, and should you write under it, you cannot avoid some peculiar graces which only cost me a second consideration to discover you: for I may say it with all the severity of truth, that every line of yours is precious. Your lordship's only fault is that you have not written more, unless I could add another, and that yet greater, but I fear for the public the accusation would not be true--that you have written, and out of a vicious modesty will not publish.|$|R
40|$|People {{have used}} animals as beasts of burden and of {{cultivation}} {{since the early}} days of agriculture. Buffalo, cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, camels, elephants and even dogs have played crucial roles in food production and transportation in a variety of environments. Increasingly, they have been replaced by motors but, with the costs rising for machines, spare parts, and fuel, the potential of animal power must be re-examined Draught animals are still in use in most ACP countries even though in reduced numbers. Could numbers be increased and could draught animals be introduced into areas where they were previously unknown, now that factors that prevented their use in the past have changed? Until recently, for example, Africa had a low population density that enabled slash and burn agriculture which was not suited to animal drawn implements which would constantly snag on tree roots. Also, in many parts of Africa the tsetse fly and trypanosomiasis precluded the use of draught animals. However now that the tsetse fly has been cleared from parts of its previous range, cattle, horses, donkeys and mules can play a major role in relieving farmers of the drudgery of hand cultivation and even seeding and weeding. For instance, in West Africa, where more than 90 % of food is still produced by small farmers, production is still from small plots of land using such simple tools as the axe, machete and hoe. Using these traditional implements, and a great deal of human energy, a farmer can cultivate up to two hectares of savanna land or half this amount in forest areas. The use of draught animals can dramatically increase the area under cultivation. In some savanna sites in West Africa, where the oxplough has been successfully introduced over the last 30 years, a team of two oxen can cultivate up to 15 ha although 6 ha is the usual average. Importance of tradition Significantly, the greatest level of success with draught animals occurs where the people have a tradition of both animal husbandry and cultivation, such as among the Fulani in the Gomba district of Nigeria. Pastoralists take readily to using animal power because of their understanding of both nutrition and disease and because they are used to handling animals, which is a small step to harnessing, training and controlling them in work. In Burkina Faso, oxen were introduced in an area where 95 % of farmers had only hand tools. The use of the animals resulted in increased food production, reduced waste and improved soil fertility. In addition, farmers' incomes were raised, jobs were provided for local craftsmen (making harnesses, ploughs and harrows) and the quality of life for many people in these rural communities was improved. Traditionally, men have been responsible for most of the land clearance and cultivation and women have been the seeders and weeders. So, it is important that where draught power is introduced for cultivation its impact on women's workload in seeding and weeding is anticipated. Now that ox-drawn seeders and weeding tools are available, it is essential that they too are introduced or the greater amount of cultivated land will overwhelm the available female labour force, and potential increases in productivity will be lost through late planting and uncontrolled weed competition. This may require some adjustment of attitudes to male and female roles since it is usual for men and boys to work draught animals and women to hand labour, and both sexes need to see the advantages of redistribution of responsibilities and workload Where there is no tradition of animal husbandry, for instance in previously forested areas, the successful introduction of draught animals can take longer and succeeds only if it is complemented by introducing farming families to animal nutrition, forage production, and animal health and handling. Any natural reluctance towards, and even fear of, livestock must be overcome by building up the knowledge and confidence which lead to competence. Alternative to mechanization Despite the apparent advantages and attraction of mechanized equipment, under the conditions found in most ACP countries draught animals often prove to be a better option. A World Bank report which examined tractor-hire projects in sub-Saharan Africa found that animals were better suited to Africa's unique conditions. Its relatively thin soil is easily damaged by tractors and all tree stumps in cleared areas have to be removed for tractors to operate satisfactorily -thus increasing the risk of soil erosion [...] whereas animals can work even if a few stumps remain. The Bank report also concluded that mechanization in Africa merelysaves labour and, in a finding that could have considerable repercussions in developing countries in general, the report states that changing from hoes to tractor ploughs 'hardly affects yields at all'. Consequently, the introduction of mechanized equipment simply causes a loss of jobs. 'As long as wages are low, draught animals are more costeffective than tractors,' was the conclusion of the report. The running and replacement cost of mechanized equipment is proving increasingly unaffordable for small and even medium-sized farmers in ACP countries and breakdowns or fuel shortages at critical times of the year can jeopardize a harvest. In contrast, draught animals can be bred locally and feed can also be produced on the farm. Draught animals also produce significant quantities of dung, which is valuable for maintaining soil fertility, and the animals can be consumed at the end of their working life. In some situations, animals actually increase in value as they mature and put on weight. For example, in Togo, a two-year old bull calf weighing 200 kg and costing about 40, 000 CFA, five years later would be worth 80, 000 CFA (based on 1985 prices). However, keeping draught animals is not without cost, and for subsistence farmers who cultivate one or two hectares there are economic risks. In many seasonally arid regions, draught animals are needed for cultivation for only a few weeks of the year and trained oxen may spend ten months each year doing little or no work. Using cows for draught as well as for milk and calf production offers a way of reducing the cost disadvantage of oxen. In a number of countries in Asia, cows are commonly used for draught where feed for livestock is scarce. The use of cows for draught has also been reported in Egypt, Ethiopia, Senegal, Tanzania and Zambia Oxen have the advantage of greater size and strength to provide a greater work output than cows, but a two draught cow system can produce approximately the same work output as an ox plus two non-draught cow system and yet uses 28 % less energy input. This represents a considerable annual saving of fodder. If cows are well fed, the effects of work may be negligible. Obviously, cows cannot be used for draught for about two months when they calve but the timing of matings can ensure that parturition and peak work demand do not coincide. It is noteworthy that the small N'Dama cattle of Sierra Leone have proved useful draught animals despite their size Draught animals for forestry The elephant has long been associated with timber extraction in the forests of southeast Asia but oxen, horses and mules have also been used widely and successfully in many countries. Teak in Java is hauled from felling site to trucking point by teams of two oxen. In Zimbabwe, mules and oxen have been used for many years; and in Malawi trials have shown that trained pairs of oxen are an alternative to tractor skidding. By 1985, there were 230 skidding oxen engaged in logging operations at five major government-owned plantations in Malawi and a study was carried out to establish the relative benefits of ox and tractor skidding. In forest thinnings, the cost of skidding logs using an agricultural tractor proved to be 3. 5 times greater for downhill skidding than oxen; and on flat terrain tractors were 7. 6 times more costly than oxen. Of these costs, expenditure on imported goods was 59 - 99 times greater for tractors than for oxen skidding. The same trend was apparent for clearfelling as for thinnings and the overall financial advantage of using oxen rather than tractors was found to be twice as great in three-row thinning as in clearfelling and to be greater on flat than on steep terrain. Although it is often considered more prestigious to work with tractors, this study revealed that a worker using oxen is likely to be more selfreliant The future If draught animals are to be used more widely they must be used more effectively. However, despite their widespread use less is known about the draught capabilities and feed requirements of the various species used than about livestock kept for meat and milk. Several research centres are now making up this 'lost ground' including the International Livestock Centre for Africa (ILCA) the Centre for Tropical Veterinary Medicine (CTVM) in Edinburgh, Scotland, and the Central American School of Animal Husbandrv in Costa Rica. ILCA is appropriately based in Ethiopia, a country having the largest draught animal population in Africa [...] perhaps 50 % of the continent's draught animals. Research has included nutrition studies and has led to the development of improved harnesses and new designs of cultivating implements and soil scrapers for small dam construction. CTVM staff have served in a wide range of countries throughout the tropics and their studies have provided useful information on metabolic rates and energy demand under varying work conditions and the benefits of using new harness designs which are less restricting than traditional <b>designs</b> and transfer <b>draught</b> power more efficiently. At the Central American School of Animal Husbandry in Costa Rice, a two-year study recently concluded that oxen use less energy and may be more efficient work animals than previously accepted. FAO figures show that oxen use 2. 5 times their basic energy requirements when they are being worked but the new study suggests a figure 33 % less than this. The Costa Rica study also found that the type of work done by an ox has little effect on its energy expenditure. Light work, such as pulling a cart, used up the same amount of energy as ploughing. This also contradicts past research The quality of fodder as well as food consumption have a critical effect; oxen on poor diets could not increase their consumption of food to match the energy expended when working. Only by increasing the quality of food eaten could animals maintain bodyweights and keep up the workload. Where food quality is poor, therefore, it is better to have two oxen (or cows) doing what work they can rather than use one animal which is soon exhausted. This is an important finding which could have a significant impact in the tropics. The failure of the single-ox cultivation programme in Ethiopia may be partly a result of this factor. Overall, the potential of draught animals in Africa is considerable and this may also be the case in the Caribbean and Pacific. Now that research is providing new information, extension services may develop soundly-based programmes for the introduction or further development of draught animal power in areas where the demands for greater productivity cannot be met by hand labour and where mechanization is neither available nor economic.
