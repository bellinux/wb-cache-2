This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding. These conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. Conformational changes can be measured using circular dichroism or <b>dual</b> <b>polarisation</b> interferometry. After binding takes place, one or more mechanisms of catalysis lower {{the energy of the}} reaction's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction.

5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. <b>Dual</b> <b>polarisation</b> interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.|$|E

25|$|The {{modes of}} action by which {{antimicrobial}} peptides kill microbes are varied, and may differ for different bacterial species. Some antimicrobial peptides kill both bacteria and fungi, e.g., psoriasin kills E. coli and several filamentous fungi. The cytoplasmic membrane {{is a frequent}} target, but peptides may also interfere with DNA and protein synthesis, protein folding, and cell wall synthesis. The initial contact between the peptide and the target organism is electrostatic, as most bacterial surfaces are anionic, or hydrophobic, {{such as in the}} antimicrobial peptide Piscidin. Their amino acid composition, amphipathicity, cationic charge and size allow them to attach to and insert into membrane bilayers to form pores by ‘barrel-stave’, ‘carpet’ or ‘toroidal-pore’ mechanisms. Alternately, they may penetrate into the cell to bind intracellular molecules which are crucial to cell living. Intracellular binding models includes inhibition of cell wall synthesis, alteration of the cytoplasmic membrane, activation of autolysin, inhibition of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and inhibition of certain enzymes. However, in many cases, the exact mechanism of killing is not known. One emerging technique for the study of such mechanisms is <b>dual</b> <b>polarisation</b> interferometry. In contrast to many conventional antibiotics these peptides appear to be bactericidal instead of bacteriostatic.

Scenarios that cause significant system performance degradation are analysed, including the effects of signal frequency, antenna size, and regional rainfall rate.

Multi polarised antennas with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiplexing can be employed to greatly enhance the capacity of a mobile system, especially at frequencies lower than 6 GHz, using their compact size. A practical antenna inherently exhibits elliptical polarisation though it may be designed to form linear or circular polarisation. Little attention has been given to this aspect of polarised waves as they have always been deemed as unwanted polarisation, although in practice, any antenna is elliptically polarised as it can never be perfectly circularly or linearly polarised. This work therefore aims to deliberately exploit this opportunity by forming antennas with elliptical polarisation to identify the advantages of doing so in order to improve orthogonality in comparison with linear polarisation. It was found that in order to achieve perfect orthogonality, it was more practical to set the magnitudes and phases of the co-polar and cross-polar linear components, which resulted in an improved co to cross polar ratio more than 20 dB better than linear polarisation in free space. A dual elliptically polarised antenna prototype was designed and evaluated in this work, which was evaluated both in free space and within an indoor measurement campaign.

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for terrestrial and satellite delivered digital multimedia services has precipitated {{the problem of}} spectrum scarcity in recent years. This has resulted in deployment of spectral efficient technologies such as MIMO for terrestrial systems. However, MIMO cannot be easily deployed for the satellite channel using conventional spatial multiplexing as the channel conditions here {{are very different from}} the terrestrial case, and it is often dominated by line of sight fading. Orthogonal circular polarization, which has long been used for increasing both frequency reuse and the power spectral density available to earth-bound satellite terminals, has recently been recommended for directly increasing the throughput available to such devices. Following that theme, this thesis proposes a novel <b>dual</b> circular <b>polarisation</b> multiplexing (DCPM) technique, which is aimed at the burgeoning area of throughput-hungry digital video broadcasting via satellite to handheld devices (DVB-SH) and digital video broadcast to the next generation of hand held (DVB-NGH) systems. In determining the working limits of DCPM, a series of measurement campaigns have been performed, from which extensive dual circular polarised land mobile satellite (LMS) channel data has been derived. Using the newly available channel data and with the aid of statistical channel modelling tools found in literature, a new dual circular polarised LMS MIMO channel model has been developed. This model, in contrast with previously available LMS MIMO channel models, is simpler to implement since it uses a distinct state-based empirical-stochastic approach. The model {{has been found to be}} robust and it easily lends itself to rapid implementation for system level MIMO and DCPM analysis. Finally, by way of bit error rate (BER) analysis in different channel fading conditions, it has been determined when best to implement polarisation multiplexing or conventional. MIMO techniques for DVB-type land mobile receivers. It is recommended that DCPM be used when the channel in predominantly Ricean, with eo-polar channel Rice factors and sub-channel cross correlation values greater than 1 dB and 0. 40 respectively. The recommendations provided by this research are valuable contributions, which may help shape the evolving DVB-NGH standardisation process.
