5000|$|Another {{especially}} controversial {{aspect of}} female perpetrated IPV is {{the theory of}} [...] "battered husband syndrome." [...] In light {{of the findings of}} the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975, Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to [...] "battered wife syndrome." [...] Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% of husbands had thrown objects, 31% of wives had done likewise; 31% of husbands had pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives, 20% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands; 10% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives with an object, 10% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands with an object. In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both husbands and wives had thrown objects; 17% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives, 13% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands; 10% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives with an object, 12% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands with an object. In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% of husbands had thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% of husbands had pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives, 12% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands; 12% of husbands <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their wives with an object, 14% of wives <b>had</b> <b>hit</b> their husbands with an object.|$|R

5|$|North American (gridiron) {{football}} traces {{its very}} origin to the University of Toronto, {{with the first}} documented football game played at University College on November 9, 1861. The Blues played their first intercollegiate football match in 1877 against the University of Michigan, {{in a game that}} ended with a scoreless draw. Since intercollegiate seasons began in 1898, the Blues have won four Grey Cup, two Vanier Cup and 25 Yates Cup championships, including the inaugural championships for all three trophies. However, the football team <b>has</b> <b>hit</b> a rough patch following its last championship in 1993. From 2001 until 2008, the Blues suffered the longest losing streak in Canadian collegiate history, recording 49 consecutive winless games. This was preceded by a single victory in 2001 that ended a run of 18 straight losses. The site of Varsity Stadium has served as the primary playing grounds of the Varsity Blues football and soccer programs since 1898. It also served as the venue for archery during the 2015 Pan American Games.|$|E

5|$|Ruth set the Major League Baseball single-season {{home run}} record four times, first at 29 (1919), then 54 (1920), 59 (1921), and finally 60 (1927). Ruth's 1920 and 1921 seasons are {{tied for the}} widest margin of victory for a home run {{champion}} as he topped the next highest total by 35 home runs in each season. The single season mark of 60 stood for 34 years until Roger Maris hit 61 home runs in 1961. Maris' mark was broken 37 years later by both Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa during the 1998 home run record chase, with McGwire ultimately setting the mark at 70. Barry Bonds, who also has the most career home runs, set the current single season record of 73 in 2001. The 1998 and 2001 seasons each had 4 players hit 50 or more home runs – Greg Vaughn, Ken Griffey, Jr., Sosa, and McGwire in 1998 and Alex Rodriguez, Luis Gonzalez, Sosa, and Bonds in 2001. A player <b>has</b> <b>hit</b> 50 or more home runs 42 times, 25 times since 1990. The lowest home run total to lead a major league was four, recorded in the NL by Lip Pike in 1877 and Paul Hines in 1878.|$|E
