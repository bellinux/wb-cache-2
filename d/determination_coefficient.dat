In this essay several sensors were installed for the use of phytomonitorization as a tool to monitor two types of deficit irrigation, RDI – Regulated Deficit Irrigation; SDI – Sustainable Deficit Irrigation. This phytomonitorization will be important in order to understand some determining physiological parameters of a vineyard in response to water stress, using the variety “Touriga Nacional”. For both types of deficit irrigation a representative grapevine was selected, on which the following phytomonitoring sensors were installed - sap flow, leaf and berry temperature and trunk diameter, canopy humidity). Leaf temperatures ranged from 6, 1 ºC to 48, 7 ºC in RDI and from 9, 2 ºC to 47, 3 ºC in SDI. For the berry temperatures the temperature ranged from 6, 1 ºC to 49 ºC in both modalities.
