I argue that neither Foot not Quinn provides a satisfactory justification of the Doctrine of <b>Doing</b> <b>and</b> Allowing, but that the idea of self-ownership discussed by Quinn can be developed to provide a justification of the doctrine...|$|R

5|$|After the {{different}} {{components of a}} scene were finished, the team at Bones created its layout art; this included things such as determining the camera position throughout the scene and how movements would be done.

These changes included corrections to off-model drawings, facial expressions, body postures, and character acting. Once the layouts had been approved, the animators drew the key animation, after which the in-between frames were drawn. Once the animated footage was completed, it was put together and rendered in stereoscopic 3D. Voice acting, music, sound effects, sound leveling and remixing was then <b>done,</b> <b>and</b> added to the cutscene.|$|E
