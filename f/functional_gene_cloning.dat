40|$|The Chinese giant {{salamander}} (Andrias davidianus) is an economically important animal on academic value. However, the genomic information {{of this species}} has been less studied. In our study, the transcripts of A. davidianus were obtained by RNA-seq to conduct a transcriptomic analysis. In total 132, 912 unigenes were generated with an average length of 690  bp and N 50 of 1263  bp by de novo assembly using Trinity software. Using a sequence similarity search against the nine public databases (CDD, KOG, NR, NT, PFAM, Swiss-prot, TrEMBL, GO and KEGG databases), a total of 24, 049, 18, 406, 36, 711, 15, 858, 20, 500, 27, 515, 36, 705, 28, 879 and 10, 958 unigenes were annotated in databases, respectively. Of these, 6323 unigenes were annotated in all database and 39, 672 unigenes were annotated {{in at least one}} database. Blasted with KEGG pathway, 10, 958 unigenes were annotated, and it was divided into 343 categories according to different pathways. In addition, we also identified 29, 790 SSRs. This study provided a valuable resource for understanding transcriptomic information of A. davidianus and laid a foundation for further research on <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>cloning,</b> genomics, genetic diversity analysis and molecular marker exploitation in A. davidianus...|$|E

In order to identify the metabolically active methane-oxidizing bacteria from this alkaline environment, DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) experiments using (CH 4) -C- 13 were carried out. This showed that both type I and type II methanotrophs were active, together with methanotrophs related to Methylocella, which had previously been found only in acidic environments. Methylotrophs, including Methylopila and Hyphomicrobium, were also detected in soil DNA and after DNA-SIP experiments. DNA sequence information on the most abundant, active methanotrophs in this alkaline soil will facilitate the design of oligonucleotide probes to monitor enrichment cultures when isolating key alkaliphilic methanotrophs from such environments...|$|R

This methanotrophic metabolism {{has been linked to}} consortia of anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). These two groups are the focus of numerous studies; however, less is known about the wide diversity of other seep associated microorganisms. We selected a hierarchical set of FISH probes targeting a range of Deltaproteobacteria diversity. Using the Magneto-FISH enrichment technique, we then magnetically captured CARD-FISH hybridized cells and their physically associated microorganisms from a methane seep sediment incubation. DNA from nested Magneto-FISH experiments was analyzed using Illumina tag 16 S rRNA gene sequencing (iTag). Enrichment success and potential bias with iTag was evaluated in the context of full-length 16 S rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>clone</b> libraries, CARD-FISH, <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>clone</b> libraries, and iTag mock communities. We determined commonly used Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) iTAG primers introduced bias in some common methane seep microbial taxa that reduced the ability to directly compare OTU relative abundances within a sample, but comparison of relative abundances between samples (in nearly all cases) and whole community-based analyses were robust. The iTag dataset was subjected to statistical co-occurrence measures of the most abundant OTUs to determine which taxa in this dataset were most correlated across all samples. Many non-canonical microbial partnerships were statistically significant in our co-occurrence network analysis, most of which were not recovered with conventional clone library sequencing, demonstrating the utility of combining Magneto-FISH and iTag sequencing methods for hypothesis generation of associations within complex microbial communities. Network analysis pointed to many co-occurrences containing putatively heterotrophic, candidate phyla such as OD 1, Atribacteria, MBG-B, and Hyd 24 - 12 and the potential for complex sulfur cycling involving Epsilon-, Delta-, and Gammaproteobacteria in methane seep ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Bacteria in soil {{microcosm}} experiments oxidized {{elevated levels}} of methyl chloride (MeCl) and methyl bromide (MeBr), the former compound more rapidly than the latter. MeBr was also removed by chemical reactions while MeCl was not. Chemical degradation dominated the early removal of MeBr and {{accounted for more than}} half of its total loss. Fractionation of stable carbon isotopes during chemical degradation of MeBr resulted in a kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 59 +/- 7 parts per thousand. Soil bacterial oxidation dominated the later removal of MeBr and MeCl and was characterized by different KIEs for each compound. The KIE for MeBr oxidation was 69 +/- 9 parts per thousand and the KIE for MeCl oxidation was 49 +/- 3 parts per thousand. Stable isotope probing revealed that different populations of soil bacteria assimilated added C- 13 -labeled MeBr and MeCl. The identity of the active MeBr and MeCl degrading bacteria in soil was determined by analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences amplified from C- 13 -DNA fractions, which identified a number of sequences from organisms not previously thought to be involved in methyl halide degradation. These included Burkholderia, the major clone type in the C- 13 -MeBr fraction, and Rhodobacter, Lysobacter and Nocardioides the major clone types in the C- 13 -MeCl fraction. None of the 16 S IRNA gene sequences for methyl halide oxidizing bacteria currently in culture (including Aminobacter strain IMB- 1 isolated from fumigated soil) were identified. <b>Functional</b> <b>gene</b> <b>clone</b> types closely related to Aminobacter spp. were identified in libraries containing the sequences for the cmuA gene, which codes for the enzyme known to catalyze the initial step in the oxidation of MeBr and MeCl. The cmuA gene was limited to members of the alpha-Proteobacteria whereas the greater diversity demonstrated by the 16 S IRNA gene may indicate that other enzymes catalyze methyl halide oxidation in different groups of bacteria.

40|$|A <b>functional</b> {{approach}} of <b>gene</b> <b>cloning</b> {{was applied to}} HeLa cells {{in an attempt to}} isolate positive mediators of programmed cell death. The approach was based on random inactivation of genes by transfections with antisense cDNA expression libraries, followed by the selection of cells that survived {{in the presence of the}} external apoptotic stimulus. An antisense cDNA fragment identical to human cathepsin D aspartic protease was rescued by this positive selection. The high cathepsin D antisense RNA levels protected the HeLa cells from interferon-gamma- and Fas/APO- 1 -induced death. Pepstatin A, an inhibitor of cathepsin D, suppressed cell death in these systems and interfered with the TNF-alpha-induced programmed cell death of U 937 cells as well. During cell death, expression of cathepsin D was elevated and processing of the protein was affected, which resulted in high steady-state levels of an intermediate, proteolytically active, single chain form of this protease. Overexpression of cathepsin D by ectopic expression induced cell death in the absence of any external stimulus. Altogether, these results suggest that this well-known endoprotease plays an active role in cytokine-induced programmed cell death, thus adding cathepsin D to the growing list of proteases that function as positive mediators of apoptosis...|$|R

However, information is limited about the bacterial nitrifiers and denitrifiers and their <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> in tannery wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) due to the low-throughput of the previously used methods. In this study, 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina high-throughput sequencing, combined with molecular methods, were used to comprehensively characterize structures and functions of nitrification and denitrification bacterial communities in aerobic and anaerobic sludge of two full-scale tannery WWTPs. Pyrosequencing of 16 S rRNA genes showed that Proteobacteria and Synergistetes dominated in the aerobic and anaerobic sludge, respectively. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA <b>gene</b> <b>cloning</b> revealed that Nitrosomonas europaea dominated the ammonia-oxidizing community in the WWTPs. Metagenomic analysis showed that the denitrifiers mainly included the genera of Thauera, Paracoccus, Hyphomicrobium, Comamonas and Azoarcus, which may greatly contribute to the nitrogen removal in the two WWTPs. It is interesting that AOB and ammonia-oxidizing archaea had low abundance although both WWTPs demonstrated high ammonium removal efficiency.

40|$|The {{proper use}} of {{resistance}} genes (R genes) requires a comprehensive understanding of their genomics and evolution. We analyzed genes encoding nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeats in the genomes of rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and Brachypodium distachyon. Frequent deletions and translocations of R genes generated prevalent presence/absence polymorphism between different accessions/species. The deletions were caused by unequal crossover, homologous repair, nonhomologous repair, or other unknown mechanisms. R gene loci identified from different genomes were mapped onto the chromosomes of rice cv Nipponbare using comparative genomics, resulting in an integrated map of 495 R loci. Sequence analysis of R genes from the partially sequenced genomes of an African rice cultivar and 10 wild accessions suggested {{that there are many}} additional R gene lineages in the AA genome of Oryza. The R genes with chimeric structures (termed type I R genes) are diverse in different rice accessions but only account for 5. 8 % of all R genes in the Nipponbare genome. In contrast, the vast majority of R genes in the rice genome are type II R genes, which are highly conserved in different accessions. Surprisingly, pseudogene-causing mutations in some type II lineages are often conserved, indicating that their conservations were not due to their functions. <b>Functional</b> R <b>genes</b> <b>cloned</b> from rice so far have more type II R genes than type I R genes, but type I R genes are predicted to contribute considerable diversity in wild species.

Both Methanosaetaceae and Methanosarcinaceae were acetoclastic methanogens which take part in converting acetate into methane and carbon dioxide directly (Ferry 1993), Methanosarcinaceae could also generate methane by utilizing methyl, hydrogen, carbon dioxide and formic acid. Detection of mcrA <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> suggests Methanosaeta (64 %) was still the dominant organism. mcrA gene affiliated with Methanomicrobiales was detected but not in 16 S rRNA <b>gene</b> <b>clone</b> library. This {{may be due to}} the too little of Methanomicrobiales in the system. In addition to that, since the acetogens of Anaerolineaceae detected as the most dominant bacteria, plenty of acetate should have generated during the intermediate metabolites. However, the acetate was detected in trace amount. Methanosaeta could have consumed acetate once it was generated and this may lead to the minimal residual of acetate. All of the evidence presented above shows that aceticlastic methanogenesis becomes the most predominant methanogenic pathway.|$|R

Results We cloned and sequenced RsaI repeat fragments pDp 1, pDp 2, pDp 3, pDp 4 of 1331, 651, 603 and 339 base pairs, respectively from the buffalo, Bubalus bubalis. Upon characterization, these fragments were found to represent retrotransposons and part of some <b>functional</b> <b>genes.</b> The resultant <b>clones</b> showed cross hybridization only with buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomic DNA. Real Time PCR, detected ~ 2 × 10 4 copies of pDp 1, ~ 3000 copies of pDp 2 and pDp 3 and ~ 1000 of pDp 4 in buffalo, cattle, goat and sheep genomes, respectively. RsaI repeats are transcriptionally active in somatic tissues and spermatozoa. Accordingly, pDp 1 showed maximum expression in lung, pDp 2 and pDp 3 both in Kidney, and pDp 4 in ovary. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed repeats to be distributed all across the chromosomes.

We used molecular approaches to evaluate the response of two bacterial terminal metabolizer groups from a coastal tidal creek sediments, sulfate reducers and methanogens, to controlled changes in carbon resource supply. Tidal creek sediment bioreactors were established in April and August 2004. For each date, intact sediment sections were continuously supplied with flowthrough seawater that was either unamended or amended with the high-molecular-weight polysaccharide dextran. Biogeochemical data indicate that the activity of fermenting bacteria and the terminal metabolizers was limited by organic carbon supply during both experiments, with {{a significant increase in}} net volatile fatty acid (VFA) production and rates of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis following dextran addition. Community composition (measured by using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, and <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> [dsrA, mcrA] <b>clone</b> libraries) changed from April to August. However, community composition was not different between amended and unamended cores within each month, despite the change in resource level. Moreover, there was no relationship between community richness and evenness with resource level. This lack of variation in community composition with C addition could be attributed to the dynamic environment these sediment communities experience in situ.

One of the rescued cDNAs, described in this work, was a fragment of a novel gene, named DAP- 5. Analysis of a DAP- 5 full-length cDNA clone revealed that it codes for a 97 -kDa protein that is highly homologous to eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 G (eIF 4 G, also known as p 220). According to its deduced amino acid sequence, this novel protein lacks the N-terminal region of eIF 4 G responsible for association with the cap binding protein eIF 4 E. The N-terminal part of DAP- 5 has 39 % identity and 63 % similarity to the central region of mammalian p 220. Its C-terminal part is less homologous to the corresponding region of p 220, suggesting that it may possess unique functional properties. The rescued DAP- 5 cDNA fragment which conveyed resistance to IFN-gamma-induced cell death was expressed from the vector in the sense orientation. Intriguingly, it comprised part of the coding region which corresponds to the less conserved C-terminal part of DAP- 5 and directed the synthesis of a 28 -kDa miniprotein. The miniprotein exerted a dual effect on HeLa cells.

40|$|The <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> {{and three}} intronless pseudogenes for human triosephosphate {{isomerase}} were isolated from a recombinant DNA library and characterized in detail. The <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> spans 3. 5 kilobase pairs and is split into seven exons. Its promoter contains putative TATA and CCAAT boxes and is extremely rich in G and C residues (76 %). The pseudogenes share {{a high degree}} of homology with the <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> but contain mutations that preclude the synthesis of an active triosephosphate isomerase enzyme. Sequence divergence calculations indicate that these pseudogenes arose approximately 18 million years ago. We present evidence that there is a single <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> in the human triosephosphate isomerase gene family...|$|R

40|$|The phylogenetic {{diversity}} of oligotrophic bacterioplankton communities was compared with 16 s ribosomal RNA <b>genes</b> <b>cloned</b> from natural populations. The data reported here extend a previous {{analysis of a}} bacterioplankton 16 s rRNA clone library with 15 additional nucleic acid clone sequences, to provide information on 60 16 s rDNA clones from hydrostation S in the Sargasso Sea. The data were compared to partial sequences of 37 Bacterial 16 s rDNA clones reported from a surface picoplankton population collected at the Aloha station in the North Pacific gyre, and partial sequences of 29 Bacterial 16 s rRNA clones obtained from sites near Bermuda and the western California Current. The results support reports of diverse groups of previously unknown a-proteobacteria, y-proteobacteria, and cyanobacteria in oceanic surface samples. Three novel lineages (SAR 12 1, 125, 145) of proteobacteria were found. Several <b>genes</b> <b>cloned</b> from the Sargasso Sea were nearly identical to <b>genes</b> <b>cloned</b> from the Pacific samples, suggesting that these previously unrecognized bacteria groups (SAR 11, SAR 122, SAR 86) are distributed widely in the surface waters of subtropical oceans. Two <b>gene</b> <b>clones</b> closely matched nucleotide sequences from the cultivated bacterial species Photobgxterium phosphoreum and Alteromonas haloplanktis.

40|$|We have {{characterized}} thymocyte circular DNA excised {{from the}} T cell receptor alpha-delta gene complex. Some delta <b>gene</b> <b>clones</b> contained unusual recombinant structures derived from V-(D) -J joining: (i) a reciprocal joint of direct V to J delta joining, skipping the D delta segment; (ii) a V-D delta coding joint lacking an adjacent D delta-J delta coding joint; (iii) a V- D structure containing two D delta segments. Many of the alpha gen clones contained both coding and reciprocal joints of V alpha-to-J alpha joining {{on the same}} structure. Most of these coding joints were out of phase; however, in one clone there was an in-phase V-J alpha structure. Interestingly, some alpha <b>gene</b> <b>clones</b> contained the same V gene sequence as rearranged in the delta <b>gene</b> <b>clone,</b> indicating that the same V gene family, at least in part, could be utilized for both the alpha and delta gene systems...|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} whether the protein encoded by agaB- 4 exhibits the enzymatic activity of β-agarase, we conducted <b>gene</b> <b>cloning,</b> expression, and purification of rAgaB- 4; and subsequently analyzed the enzyme properties. For <b>gene</b> <b>cloning,</b> specific primers were designed {{and used to}} amplify the DNA fragment encoding the mature AgaB- 4 through PCR. The PCR product was then cloned into pJET 1.2 to yield pJET-AGAB- 4. Subsequently, the agarase DNA fragment was excised from pJET-AGAB- 4 and inserted into pET- 29 a(+) to yield the agarase expression vector pET-AGAB- 4.|$|R

40|$|The {{elevational}} and latitudinal diversity {{patterns of}} microbial taxa have attracted great {{attention in the}} past decade. Recently, the distribution of functional attributes {{has been in the}} spotlight. Here, we report a study profiling soil microbial communities along an elevation gradient (500 to 2200 m) on Changbai Mountain. Using a comprehensive <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> microarray (GeoChip 5. 0), we found that microbial <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> richness exhibited a dramatic increase at the treeline ecotone, but the bacterial taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity based on 16 S rRNA gene sequencing did not exhibit such a similar trend. However, the β-diversity (compositional dissimilarity among sites) for both bacterial taxa and <b>functional</b> <b>genes</b> was similar, showing significant elevational distance-decay patterns which presented increased dissimilarity with elevation. The bacterial taxonomic diversity/structure was strongly influenced by soil pH, while the <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> diversity/structure was significantly correlated with soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC). This finding highlights that soil DOC may be a good predictor in determining the elevational distribution of microbial <b>functional</b> <b>genes.</b> The finding of significant shifts in <b>functional</b> <b>gene</b> diversity at the treeline ecotone could also provide valuable information for predicting the responses of microbial functions to climate change...|$|R
