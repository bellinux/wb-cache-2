The article argues that in Lindsey, the Ninth Circuit misconstrued the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s discussion of the preemptive scope of the FCLAA by failing to read it in the proper contex and that the FCLAA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preemption</b> provision was not intended to prevent the particular types of regulations involved in Lindsey and these other cases. It argues that the preemption provision was only meant to preempt health-risk or health-related requirements or prohibitions with respect to the advertising or promotion of cigarettes, which these regulations do not involve. The article also revisits Cipollone, examines the different positions taken with respect to the issue of whether the FCLAA preempts state law tort claims, and concludes that the decision that the FCLAA 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preemption</b> provision does preempt certain state law tort damages claims is probably not the best result. The article contends that Congress never intended this provision to be used to 2 ̆ 2 immunize 2 ̆ 2 cigarette manufacturers from such claims; in addition, state law tort damages claims serve important functions. It concludes with an argument that Cipollone prevents any regulation of cigarette manufacturers 2 ̆ 7 behavior and any state imposed obligations manufacturers owe to their customers, and that this result is undesirable...|$|R

40|$|Daily front-page stories {{recounting the}} failure of defibrillators, pacemakers, heart stents and {{infusion}} pumps have {{raised questions about the}} adequacy of FDA regulation of medical devices. At the same time, lower courts are struggling to apply the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s ruling in Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr to determine the preemptive reach of the Medical Device Amendments (2 ̆ 2 MDA 2 ̆ 2). This article explores the repercussions of Medtronic and argues that Congress 2 ̆ 7 use of words like 2 ̆ 2 requirements 2 ̆ 2 in regulatory statutes should be seen as references to positive state law only, and should not be read, absent an explicit command by Congress, to subsume state law damage actions. The lower courts 2 ̆ 7 confusion over Medtronic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preemption</b> rule may have been sown by the complexity of the opinion itself. Fairly read, Medtronic 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preemption</b> rule is narrow, requiring specific and conflicting requirements for a device imposed by both state and federal law. General tort duties do not trigger preemption because they do not impose requirements specific to a given device. The article also explores the Executive Branch 2 ̆ 7 s current efforts to push its tort reform agenda by pressing broad preemption arguments in private tort litigation. The article argues that courts should be wary of such efforts and suggests that, by working to shield industry from tort liability, the Administration has given the public reason to question whether the FDA is serving the interests of the public or the industry it regulates. Finally, the article argues that preemption claims are an effort to shed an important source of market discipline - the threat of liability for visiting unjustifiable harm on others - a discipline that regulation cannot itself provide. Judges reviewing preemption claims should evaluate industry 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preemption</b> claims in light of the overall regulatory and liability context. Medical devices are an illustration of the inadequacy of relying on regulation alone. The MDA was passed in response to several notorious medical device failures, failures which were brought to light through product liability litigation.

40|$|Starting in 1995 and {{throughout}} the subprime boom during the next decade, Congress failed {{to take action to}} curb predatory mortgage lending. Many states and cities filled the void by passing anti-predatory lending laws of their own. Lenders, worried about potential liability, quickly organized a full-scale attack on the state and local initiatives. Their most potent strategy lay in challenging the laws and ordinances under federal preemption rules for national banks and federal savings associations that precluded states from enforcing their anti-predatory lending laws. The Dodd-Frank Act curtailed the preemption rules by establishing that state consumer financial laws can only be preempted if they discriminate against state-chartered depository institutions relative to, or prevent or significantly interfere with the powers of, national banks or federal savings associations.

A definition of judicial corruption in social terms is found only in the Ecloga of Leo III the Isaurian : bribery; favour to friends; protection from hostile acts; fear of the dynatoi. But the legislator placed the problem at the level of Christian morality. Later Leo VI tried to secure the good function of the Byzantine judicial system by imposing temporal and even spiritual punishment. The measures of the emperors of the following centuries were inspired either by Justinian's approach or by that of Leo III. In the Novels of the emperors of the Macedonian dynasty on the <b>preemption</b> <b>right</b> of the poor, judicial corruption is denounced again as a cause of social injustice.

40|$|The author argues {{here that}} a {{declaration}} of victory by the critics of the dormant foreign affairs doctrine would be premature. Notwithstanding the Court 2 ̆ 7 s citation of Ashwander v. TVA, the actual grounds of the decision in Crosby were in no meaningful sense less 2 ̆ 2 constitutional 2 ̆ 2 in nature than a decision based on the dormant foreign affairs power would have been. Moreover, even though the Court said that its decision {{was based on a}} straightforward application of 2 ̆ 2 settled [...] . implied preemption doctrine, 2 ̆ 2 the Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preemption</b> analysis was anything but ordinary. Indeed, Crosby 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> version of <b>preemption</b> analysis is subject to the same sorts of objections that Zschernig 2 ̆ 7 s critics have directed at the dormant foreign affairs doctrine. Moreover, if the case were taken as a model for deciding issues of preemption in purely domestic cases, it would be anything but narrow. The decision would be narrow only if its approach to preemption were confined to suits implicating foreign relations. But then the decision would be exceptionalist, and the Court 2 ̆ 7 s holding would begin to resemble a decision on dormant foreign affairs grounds. The author suggests here that Crosby 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> approach to <b>preemption</b> was so extraordinary that it would have yielded the same conclusion with respect to the Massachusetts Burma Law even if there had been no Federal Burma Law. Crosby thus offers little cause for celebration to the critics of dormant foreign affairs doctrine. Part I of this article describes the Zschernig decision and explains how the lower courts in Crosby relied on it in striking down the Massachusetts Burma Law. Although the Supreme Court in Crosby avoided that seemingly constitutional issue in favor of a purportedly sub-constitutional preemption holding, Part II of this article argues that there is less of a difference than may at first appear between a holding based on the dormant foreign affairs doctrine and one based on obstacle preemption. Both are sub-constitutional in all relevant respects, and obstacle preemption is in any event vulnerable to the same criticisms that have been leveled at the dormant foreign affairs doctrine. Part III argues that Crosby perpetuates foreign affairs exceptionalism. Part III(A) contrasts the Crosby decision with the Court 2 ̆ 7 s recent constitutional federalism decisions and speculates that the implications of the latter cases may have been overlooked in Crosby because the case was perceived primarily as a foreign affairs case. Part III(B) looks more closely at the reasons the Court gave in Crosby to justify its preemption holding and argues that they were so extraordinarily conducive to a finding of preemption that they would have yielded the invalidation of the Massachusetts Burma Law even if there had been no Federal Burma Law. Part IV considers the recent academic critiques of the Zschernig doctrine and concludes that they justify at most a modest reformulation, but not the abandonment, of the dormant foreign affairs doctrine. The author suggests that the Crosby decision would have rested on sounder, and narrower, grounds if the Court had interpreted Zschernig to stand for the proposition that state laws are invalid if they single out a state or a group of states, or their nationals or those who deal with them, for unfavorable treatment...|$|R

This “intersectionality” problem leads to a state of affairs that is contrary to ERISA 2 ̆ 7 s purpose of protecting the interests of participants and beneficiaries by 2 ̆ 2 providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts. 2 ̆ 2 To cure what currently ails ERISA, this article proposes three alternative reforms - one judicial and two legislative. The judicial approach would call for the Court to adopt a remedialist approach, which would be in line both with Congress 2 ̆ 7 s intent to incorporate most of the common law of trusts into ERISA, and also consistent with a modern interpretation of a remedial statute. Additionally, Congress should re-examine and reject the far-fetched analogy between ERISA, enacted in 1974, and the 2 ̆ 2 days of the divided bench 2 ̆ 2 analysis and provide an express and expansive definition for 2 ̆ 2 appropriate equitable relief 2 ̆ 2 under proposed Section 3 (43). Finally, Congress should pass an ERISA Civil Rights Act under proposed Section 502 (a) (11), which, like the Civil Rights Act of 1991 in the Title VII context, would permit capped, compensatory and punitive damage awards in appropriate cases...|$|R
40|$|This {{is a short}} response, {{published}} in Pennumbra (the online companion to the University of Pennsylvania Law Review), to Gil Seinfeld 2 ̆ 7 s recent article, 2 ̆ 2 The Puzzle of Complete Preemption. 2 ̆ 2 I first sound some notes of agreement with Professor Seinfeld 2 ̆ 7 s critique of the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> complete <b>preemption</b> doctrine. I then turn to his proposed reshaping of the doctrine around the interest in federal legal uniformity. Although certainly more satisfying than the Court 2 ̆ 7 s account, Professor Seinfeld 2 ̆ 7 s refashioning of the doctrine raises {{a number of new}} difficulties. In particular, it invites the federal courts to engage in a range of line-drawing exercises to which they may not be especially well suited. I conclude by suggesting that the difficulties raised by Professor Seinfeld 2 ̆ 7 s refashioning support the view that complete preemption should depend on congressional intent, not judicial invention...|$|R
40|$|Presently, {{broadcasters}} {{and cable}} television companies {{deal directly with}} the two baseball leagues and the individual clubs, which in turn purport to sell all of the rights regarding the televising of the games. The players {{wanted to be a}} part of those contracts to get a bigger share of the television revenues. In the Baltimore Orioles case both sides sought a judicial resolution of their rights in the telecasts. The baseball players 2 ̆ 7 demand was based on their rights of publicity in their performances. This common law right allegedly precluded the clubs and the leagues from contracting with the broadcasters for televising the players 2 ̆ 7 performances without first obtaining their express consent. Thus, the players asserted that the telecasts of major league games were unauthorized and, therefore, infringed their property rights. In response, the clubs alleged that they owned the exclusive right to broadcast the games as well as all rights in the telecasts. The opinions in the Baltimore Orioles litigation are seriously flawed. The courts did not correctly analyze what protection the Copyright Act extends to the telecast of a live event and both courts erroneously applied the Act 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preemption</b> provision so expansively that right of publicity claims appear to be extinguished whenever the exploited aspect of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s persona is contained in a copyrighted work. This article discusses the opinions in Baltimore Orioles, Inc., v. Major League Baseball Players Association and analyzes the nature and scope of the protection copyright grants to the telecast of a live event such as a baseball game. It points out the flaws in the opinions and demonstrates why the rights of publicity which professional athletes have in their performances should not be preempted whenever those performances are embodied in copyrighted audiovisual works. The last section explains why this article 2 ̆ 7 s arguments against federal preemption should also preserve the publicity interests that actors, singers, and other entertainers have in their acts, routines, and performing styles whether or not their performances are fixed in copyrighted works...|$|R
40|$|The federal {{preemption}} {{of state}} law {{has emerged as}} a prominent field of study for legal scholars and political scientists. This rise to prominence of a technical and often dull field of jurisprudence is due to a number of developments-increasingly frequent federal statutory preemptions; the states 2 ̆ 7 unprecedented aggressiveness in regulating business transactions, the expansion of corporate liability under state common law and the increased resort of corporate defendants to federal preemption defenses; and, not least, the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s discovery of federalism and states 2 ̆ 7 <b>rights.</b> Unfortunately, the <b>preemption</b> debate has been marred by misperceptions and a lack of reliable data. Extravagant attention has been lavished on a few landmark cases, which may not be a reliable guide to the preemption universe. Studies of judicial behavior in this area have relied on an inadequate empirical foundation. This Article presents an empirical overview and a preliminary analysis of the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>preemption</b> decisions. Part II describes the case universe and the outcomes. Part III discusses the role of the Supreme Court-more precisely, the Court 2 ̆ 7 s perception of its own role-in preemption litigation. Part IV suggests that outcomes in preemption cases may be most readily explained as judicial responses to certain signals or 2 ̆ 2 cues. 2 ̆ 2 Two signals in particular prove significant: the presence of a state as a party to a preemption dispute, and the position of the Solicitor General. State amicus briefs and the partisan affiliation of the Solicitor General (Democrat or Republican) may also affect preemption case outcomes; however, we cannot show either variable to be statistically significant Part V examines the justices 2 ̆ 7 votes in preemption cases and addresses the discontinuity between the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism cases and its preemption decisions. The Court 2 ̆ 7 s federalism decisions have, until very recently, worked a major doctrinal shift in federal-state relations, in favor of the states. That shift has been the work of a stable bloc of five conservative justices, who have carried the federalism banner against a bloc of four liberal justices. In preemption cases, in contrast, liberals often vote against preemption (and thus 2 ̆ 2 for the states 2 ̆ 2), whereas conservative justices often flip-flop in the opposite direction. We find substantial evidence to buttress the impression of preemption cases as a mirror image of pure federalism cases. Unlike federalism law, however, preemption law shows no clear decisional trend. Moreover, we find no firm voting blocs and no swing vote. The concluding Part VI re-examines the perceived discontinuity between the Rehnquist Court 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> federalism and <b>preemption</b> decisions in light of the evidence and argues that a satisfactory explanation of that phenomenon is bound to be more complicated than a simple 2 ̆ 2 attitudinal 2 ̆ 2 model of judicial behavior would suggest...|$|R
