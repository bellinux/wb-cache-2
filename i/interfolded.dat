40|$|Complex {{microbial}} {{populations are}} organized {{in relation to}} their environment. In the intestine, the inner lining (mucosa) is a potential focal point for such organization. The proximal murine colon contains mucosal folds that are known to be associated with morphologically distinct microbes. To identify these microbes, we used the technique of laser capture microdissection (LCM) to sample microbes associated with these folds (<b>interfold</b> region) and within the central lumen (digesta region). Using 16 S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing, we found that microbes in the <b>interfold</b> region were highly enriched for the phylum Firmicutes and, more specifically, for the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae. Other families such as Bacteroidaceae, Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae were all enriched in the digesta region.

40|$|SummaryThe {{quest to}} order and {{classify}} protein structures has lead to various classification schemes, focusing mostly on hierarchical relationships between structural domains. At the coarsest classification level, such schemes typically identify hundreds {{of types of}} fundamental units called folds. As a result, we picture protein structure space {{as a collection of}} isolated fold islands. It is obvious, however, that many protein folds share structural and functional commonalities. Locating those commonalities is important for our understanding of protein structure, function, and evolution. Here, we present an alternative view of the protein fold space, based on an <b>interfold</b> similarity measure that is related to the frequency of fragments shared between folds. In this view, protein structures form a complicated, crossconnected network with very interesting topology. We show that <b>interfold</b> similarity based on sequence/structure fragments correlates well with similarities of functions between protein populations in different folds...|$|R

The Garub {{sequence}} represents the oldest rocks in the Aus area and comprises a diverse group of layered rocks of mainly semi-pelitic, pelitic, mafic, calcareous and quartzose composition. These rocks have been metamorphosed to form marbles, calcitic gneisses, metaquartzites, biotite schists, sillimanitecordierite garnet gneisses, amphibolites and granolites with minor amounts of iron formation and magnesian rocks. The principal metasediments are concentrated in west-trending zones. A central zone of calcareous rocks broadens westwards and contains the largest known bodies of carbonate rocks in the Namaqua Metamorphic Complex. The calcareous zone is bounded in the north by a narrow beit of quartzose rocks and in the south, by a broad zone of aluminous rocks. Gradational rock types between these zones are compatible with original sedimentary lithofacies changes.

The superficial beds (for I nowhere obtained sections more than twenty feet deep) retain, even close to the mountains, their usual character: the uppermost layer, however, in one place included pebbles of quartz, and rested on a mass of detritus of the same rock. At the very foot of the mountains, there were some few piles of quartz and tosca-rock detritus, including land-shells; but at the distance of only half a mile from these lofty, jagged, and battered mountains, I could not, to my great surprise, find on the boundless surface of the calcareous plain even a single pebble. Quartz- pebbles, however, of considerable size have at some period been transported to a distance of between forty and fifty miles to the shores of Bahia Blanca.

40|$|The Noggin Cove Formation {{consists}} {{mainly of}} fragmental mafic volcanic rocks with subordinate pillowed basalt and black shale. Massive volcanic conglomerates and coarse sandstones, with lesser amounts of medium-bedded tuffs and lapilli breccias, dominate the fragmental rocks. Volcanic conglomerates and coarse-grained sandstones were predominantly deposited as subaqueous debris flows, {{some of which}} are spectacular in terms of their thickness and clast size. [...] The volume of fragmental rocks relative to basaltic lavas indicates an explosive volcanic source; ubiquitous vesicular clasts indicate shallow marine to subareal eruption. Debris flow conglomerates and sandstones dominate southern exposures but in the north they are subordinate to basaltic lavas and shallow marine deposits (highly calcareous tuffs and breccias). This distribution implies fragmental rocks were transported southward to form a marine volcaniclastic apron over pillow lavas, lava flows and basaltic dykes. [...] The Carmanville Melange consists mainly of sandstone, siltstone and mafic volcanic clasts and blocks in a black shale matrix. Melange is interbedded and <b>interfolded</b> with volcanic rocks of the underlying Noggin Cove Formation and with siltstones and sandstones of the overlying Woody Island Siltstone. In many cases, folded beds of siltstone can be seen within the black shale matrix. The melange is interpreted as olistostromal. [...] The Noggin Cove Formation and Carmanville Melange have undergone at least three stages of folding. D₂ deformation is the most intense, resulting in a very strong northeast trending cleavage which is axial planar to tight to isoclinal folds. Microprobe, SEM and textural analyses show that greenschist facies metamorphism and subsequent contact metamorphism have extensively altered the volcanic rocks of the Noggin Cove Formation.

40|$|The Pelican thrust {{is a major}} ductile high-strain zone in the Reindeer Zone, Trans-Hudson Orogen, {{northern}} Saskatchewan. It {{is interpreted}} as the main sole thrust separating stacked juvenile Paleoproterozoic allochthons and underlying Archean microcontinental crust in this {{central part of the}} orogen. Exposed nonmylonitic rocks in the footwall of the thrust consist of the Sahli monzocharnockite and the smaller, more highly retrograded MacMillan Point granite. Protomylonitic to ultramylonitic gneisses in the thrust zone derive from a variety of prethrust protoliths. A footwall "internal suite" mainly comprises quartzofeldspathic orthogneisses ("Q" gneisses) and high-grade migmatitic paragneisses. Hanging-wall "external suite" mylonitic gneisses include feldspar-porphyroclastic hornblendic grey gneisses probably derived from arc plutons, and laminated amphibolites derived from volcanic rocks. The overlying allochthon mainly comprises protoliths equivalent to those of the porphyroclastic orthogneisses and laminated amphibolites, together with <b>interfolded</b> and overlying Paleoproterozoic paragneisses of the Kisseynew domain. The Sahli monzocharnockite yields 207 Pb/ 206 Pb zircon and whole-rock Rb-Sr ages of ca. 2500 Ma, and the "Q" gneisses give 207 Pb/ 206 Pb zircon ages of up to ca. 2900 Ma, implying that most of the internal suite (footwall) mylonite protoliths are Archean. In contrast, external suite (hanging wall) porphyroclastic orthogneisses yield ca. 1880 - 1840 Ma 207 Pb/ 206 Pb zircon ages. Main, peak-metamorphic displacement on the Pelican thrust is interpreted to have occurred mainly between 1840 and 1820 Ma, as indicated by 207 Pb/ 206 Pb zircon ages from small, highly deformed synthrusting granite-pegmatite neosomal bodies in the thrust zone. Undeformed postcollisional granites and pegmatites were emplaced ∼ 1789 Ma. Total duration from arc development to completion of arc-continent collision was ∼ 100 Ma. The Pelican thrust zone may be similar in significance and style to younger, major, ocean closure related thrusts such as the Frontal Pennine thrust of the western Alps and the Main Mantle, Main Boundary, and Main Central thrusts of the Himalayas.

40|$|The Mesoarchaean Kapisilik and Eoarchaean Isukasia terranes in the Nuuk {{region of}} {{southern}} West Greenland were tectonically juxtaposed in the Archaean. The {{north of the}} Isukasia terrane is distal from the Kapisilik terrane and has only rare growth of 2690 Ma metamorphic zircon and no 2980 - 2950 Ma metamorphic zircon. The {{southern part of the}} Isukasia terrane lies between two 2690 Ma shear zones, and has locally preserved high pressure granulite facies assemblages and widespread growth of 2980 - 2950 Ma metamorphic zircon and also sporadic growth of 2690 Ma metamorphic zircon. Within this southern part of the Isukasia terrane there is a folded klippe of mylonitised Mesoarchaean detrital meta-sedimentary rocks (carrying 3 ̆e 3600 and 3070 Ma detrital zircons), mafic and ultramafic rocks, with 2970 Ma metamorphic zircon overgrowths. South of the Isukasia terrane is the Kapisilik terrane, containing 3070 Ma arc-related volcanic rocks, gabbro-anorthosites and meta-tonalites, intruded by 2970 - 2960 Ma granites. Zircons of an Ivisârtoq supracrustal belt 3075 Ma intermediate volcanic rock have initial eopenHf values of + 2 to + 5 thus are juvenile crustal additions. 3070 Ma tonalites along the northern edge of the Kapisilik terrane have whole rock positive initial eopenNd values and thus are also juvenile crustal additions. In contrast, igneous zircons in 2960 Ma granites intruded into juvenile 3075 Ma supracrustal rocks of the Kapisilik terrane have initial eopenHf values of - 5 to - 10, and must have involved the partial melting of 3 ̆e 3600 Ma Isukasia terrane rocks. The integrated structural and zircon U-Th-Pb-Hf isotopic data show that at 2980 - 2950. Ma the Kapisilik terrane juvenile arc components collided with, and over-rid, the Isukasia terrane. The southern edge of the Isukasia terrane came to lie in the deep crust under the Ivisârtoq supracrustal belt and melted at 2970 - 2960. Ma to produce granites. These granites derived from ancient crust rose into the upper crust, where they intruded the overlying allochthonous juvenile 3075. Ma Ivisârtoq supracrustal belt arc assemblages.

Ma metamorphism. The mixed Eoarchaean-Mesoarchaean detrital provenance suggests that the klippe could be dismembered components of an accretionary prism or forearc crust. The northern part of the Isukasia terrane is interpreted as foreland, free of 2980 - 2950. Ma high-grade metamorphic overprint. This shows that the Isukasia terrane is not a coherent block, but contains ancient rocks that are parautochthonous or allochthonous to each other, with contrasting later metamorphic history. At 2690.

40|$|We present {{new field}} and geochronological data for two newly {{identified}} sequences of Neoproterozoic metasedimentary rocks, the Mecubúri and Alto Benfica Groups, <b>interfolded</b> with the Nampula Complex, NE Mozambique. Both groups comprise clastic sequences of meta-psammites and meta-conglomerates, which were strongly deformed, metamorphosed to sillimanite grade and locally migmatised. The relatively unsheared {{contacts with the}} surrounding Mesoproterozoic gneisses suggest that both groups are largely autochthonous. The depositional environment of the sequences is interpreted as a proximal, continental-fluvial environment in small depositional, possibly inter-montane, fault-controlled basins. Evidence of post-Mesoproterozoic exposure to the surface is provided by secondary nodular sillimanite growth in the Mecubúri Group and the underlying high-grade basement, pointing to weathering and/or epigenetic hydrothermal alteration to clays prior to burial, deformation and metamorphism. U–Pb analyses of detrital zircons constrain maximum depositional ages of 530 ± 18 and 938 ± 32 Ma for the Mecubúri and Alto Benfica Groups, respectively. The two groups have different provenances as shown by their detrital zircon age-frequency distributions. The Mecubúri Group {{was derived from the}} adjacent eastern Nampula Complex basement (ca. 1100 Ma), with minor early and mid-Neoproterozoic (950 – 700 Ma) and abundant late Neoproterozoic components (650 – 550 Ma). The latter were probably derived from Neoproterozoic terranes north of the Lurio belt, such as the Cabo Delgado Nappe Complex (CDNC). Hf isotope data indicate a juvenile origin to the Nampula Complex basement (Hf ca. + 4 to 8) which was then re-worked as the source for the late Neoproterozoic melts (Hf ca. 0 to + 5). Juvenile magmatic input also continued in the late Neoproterozoic (Hf ca. + 11). In addition to the dominant ca. 1100 Ma local source rocks, the Alto Benfica Group, in the western Nampula Complex, records input from older Mesoproterozoic (1200 – 1400 Ma), Palaeoproterozoic (1600 – 2000 Ma) and rare Archaean sources, with scant evidence of Neoproterozoic provenance. These sources themselves reflect re-working of older pre-existing crustal components with crustal separation ages up to 3000 Ma. Zircon rims to detrital grains and metamorphic monazite from both groups date high-grade metamorphism at 500 ± 10 Ma, within uncertainty of the age for late to post-tectonic granitoids of the Nampula Complex and the Lurio belt. This suggests an intimate genetic relationship between the metamorphism and migmatisation of the two metasedimentary sequences and granite emplacement at that time. The detrital zircon data from the Alto Benfica Group suggest that the Nampula Complex was juxtaposed with the adjacent terranes of northern Mozambique and SE Africa, which were uplifted, exposed to sub-aerial weathering and locally lateritised at the time of deposition. The terrane juxtaposition event can be equated with the main, NW–SE-directed collision phase of the East African Orogeny at ca. 550 Ma. The resulting mountain belt was rapidly eroding and providing detritus for the two clastic sequences at ca. 530 Ma, probably during the early phases of extensional orogenic collapse. Later in the extensional phase, local SW–NE oriented compression deformed the Mecubúri and Alto Benfica Groups, along with the basement, into tight upright folds, with associated axial planar foliation. Sillimanite-grade metamorphism and migmatisation, associated with the emplacement of late-tectonic granites took place at ca. 500 Ma. It follows that none of the regional fabrics and large-scale structures in the Nampula Complex are Mesoproterozoic in age; the present distribution of lithological units and structures are almost entirely the result of the East African collisional orogeny at ca. 550 Ma and its subsequent extension and collapse...|$|E
40|$|The Vestfold Hills, Antarctica, an {{ice-free}} {{region of}} ea. 400 km 2, {{is a well}} exposed terrane of deep Archaean and Proterozoic crust which has been strongly <b>interfolded</b> and transposed. Between 2350 and 1100 Ma a dense network of mafic dykes intruded at mid- to upper crustal depths. Crosscutting relationships distinguish 9 different dyke sets intruded in three magmatic episodes. These three episodes exhibit distinct directional trends suggesting rotation of the regional crustal stress field over the period 2350 to 1150 Ma. During the first magmatic episode high-Mg tholeiites were emplaced at about 2350 Ma together with Fe-rich tholeiites. A second magmatic period has been inferred at 1800 Ma in which a further set of Fe-rich tholeiites was emplaced. Radiogenic dating of the 1800 Ma dykes is not well constrained and field observations from {{this study did not}} clarify the relationship of these dykes to the older (2350 Ma) Fe-rich tholeiites. A third magmatic episode, which occurred between 1350 and 1150 Ma, emplaced two sets of lamprophyric dykes and Fe-rich tholeiites, in at least four separate events. Previous studies have concluded that the 2350 Ma old high-Mg tholeiites were emplaced at deep crustal levels (7 - 8 kbar). New pressure estimates based on aluminium exchange between clinopyroxene and plagioclase and on pressure dependent trends of magmatic evolution reveal that these dykes were more likely emplaced at considerably lower levels (< 5 kb), possibly as low as 1 - 2 kbar. This requires much faster uplift of the Vestfold Hills block, during the late Archaean and early Proterozoic, than previously thought The 2350 Ma high-Mg tholeiites can be divided into 3 geochemically distinct groups which are not related by simple crystal fractionation processes. The high Si 02 and MgO, and low Ti 02 magmas and are enriched in platinum group elements and gold: all characteristic of siliceous high magnesian basalts (SHMB). A fundamental question arises as to whether these geochemical characteristics are primary features inherited from the mantle or whether the magmas have been modified through assimilation of continental crust. This has been assessed by evaluating the extent to which differentiation processes are able to account for geochemical variations within one of the largest dykes in the Vestfold Hills has been studied in detail. This dyke is found to be of virtual homogeneous composition, apart from some minor variations in major- and trace elements which are consistent with limited in situ differentiation. Major and minor element geochemistry shows no evidence exists for crustal contamination in this dyke. A large noritic ring complex (ea. 7 - 8 km in diameter) is associated with the intrusion of the 2350 Ma high-Mg tholeiite suite. It consists of several partly isolated bodies which vary in width from 70 to 400 m. This complex comprises three lithological units: (1) Homogeneous Norite, the most uniform and voluminous unit, containing cumulus orthopyroxene with clinopyroxene and plagioclase as intercumulus phases, (2) the Mottled Norite, a unit characterized by large 1 - 2 cm plagioclase - alkali-feldspar aggregates, and (3) the Rubbly Norite, a less common variant, distinguished by patches of bronzitic orthopyroxene, cognate and inherited xenoliths, and globules of sulphide. The xenoliths are mostly orthopyroxenites but also include websterites, sapphirine-bearing fine-grained quartzite, and feldspathic gneiss. The sulphide-rich zones range in size from 4 to 30 m in width, with extensions up to 400 m in length {{in the southern part of}} the complex. Evidence for multiple intrusion suggests the Rubbly Norite was subsequently emptaced into the the Homogeneous and Mottled Norite units...|$|E
