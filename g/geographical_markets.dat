5000|$|The Ansoff Matrix model {{invented by}} H. Igor Ansoff; {{is a model}} that focuses on four main areas; Market penetration, Product {{development}}, Market development and Market Diversification. These are further split into two areas known as the ‘New’ and ‘Present’. From this strategy, businesses are able to determine the product and market growth. This is done by focusing on whether the market is a new market or an already existing one, and whether the products are new or not. Market penetration covers products that are familiar to the consumers, this creates a low risk as the product is already on the established market. Product development is {{the introduction of a}} new product into an existing market. This can include modifications to an already existing market which can create a product that has more appeal. Market development, also known as market extension, is when an already existing product is introduced to a new market in order to identify and build a new clientele base. This can include new <b>geographical</b> <b>markets,</b> new distribution channels, and different pricing policies. Diversification, is the riskiest area for a business. This is where a new product is sold to a new market. There are two type of Diversification [...] "Related" [...] which means the business remains in the same industry that they are familiar with. The other is [...] "Unrelated" [...] which is when there are no previous relations or market experiences for the business.|$|E

In this paper, we propose a spatial multinomial model of customer choice and illustrate how spatial modeling of choices of online customers across <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> provides useful insights {{in the context of a}} product mix and pricing decision of an online book publisher. The spatial multinomial model specifically accounts for the spatial correlations among customer choices among different product forms—print and PDF. The estimation results obtained using data generated from an online experiment show that the spatial model accounts for the geographical variation in many of the unobserved effects possibly due to locational differences and price sensitivities. The resultant spatial decision maps provide useful predictions as to how purchase rates vary across <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> as a function of the price differential between product forms, with implications for targeting customers through local market advertising, direct marketing, and cross-channel promotion. spatial model, mixed multinomial logit, pricing, digital products, Internet...|$|E

We show that if we currently take the traditional approach by considering for each member state whether there is one single other country that provides a substitute for domestic production, the market in each separate member state has still to be considered a separate market. However, if we allow for the possibility that at different moments in time there is another country that provides a substitute for domestic production, then the conclusion should be that certain member states do not constitute a separate <b>geographical</b> <b>market.</b> This is in particular true for Belgium, but also for The Netherlands, France, and to some extent also for Germany and Austria.

40|$|Economic {{globalization}} {{has created an}} interdependent market that allows companies to transcend traditional national boundaries to conduct business overseas. In the international construction market, companies often adopt diversification as a strategy for growth, for risk management or for both. However, the diversification patterns of international construction companies (ICCs) as a group are barely clear. The primary aim {{of this research is}} to cover this knowledge void by mapping ICCs’ diversification patterns in both business sectors and geographical dispersal. It starts from a literature review of diversification theories. Based on the review, a series of hypotheses relating to ICCs’ diversification are proposed. Data are gleaned from Engineering News-Record, i. e. Bloomberg and Capital IQ, ranging from 2001 to 2015. By testing the hypotheses, it is found that larger ICCs prefer to diversify than their smaller counterparts. Most of the ICCs tend to diversify to <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> with similar cultural or institutional environment. Market demands drive ICCs to diversify to different <b>geographical</b> <b>markets</b> while they are more prudential in venturing into new business sectors. The research provides not only valuable insights into diversification patterns of ICCs, but also a solid point of departure for future theoretical and empirical studies...|$|E
