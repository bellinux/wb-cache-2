5|$|The {{use of an}} {{aluminium}} {{body was}} controversial, and international experts recommended that the tram company should not choose that solution. The goal was to decrease the weight so the trams could operate with less-powerful motors, giving a lower cost. The first prototype was a <b>full-scale</b> <b>model</b> of a tram, built at Homansbyen Depot in 1935, using an undercarriage from disused horsecars.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Nakashima, Francois Sammer (a Czech {{architect}} {{who had worked}} for Le Corbusier in Russia) and Chandulal (a devotee who had trained as an engineer), built a <b>full-scale</b> <b>model</b> of the dormitory in order to test the feasibility of the design, and then used it as a laboratory to further refine the construction methods. Nakashima's duties included doing very explicit detail drawings showing, for example, the design of the concrete formwork. Devotees even donated brass utensils so that they could be melted down to make door handles and hinges.|$|E

5|$|In February 1917, the British General Staff {{released}} a training pamphlet titled SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, espousing {{the return to}} the pre-war emphasis on fire and movement tactics {{and the use of}} the platoon as a self-contained tactical unit. The short pamphlet noted the importance of dedicated hand grenade, rifle grenade and machine gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points with an appropriate level of fire to permit other military units to advance. Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures, the Canadian Corps instilled the tactical change with vigour. The corps instilled the tactical doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to the platoon level. Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as <b>full-scale</b> <b>model</b> representations of the battlefield. Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{was scheduled}} to take up to 133 days, although the actual filming took 128. Filming began on 7 November 2011 in and around London, with the cinematographer Roger Deakins using Arri Alexa digital cameras to shoot the entire film. Scenes were shot in London Underground stations, Smithfield car park in West Smithfield, the National Gallery, Southwark, Whitehall, Parliament Square, Charing Cross station the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich, Cadogan Square and Tower Hill. St Bartholomew's Hospital {{was used as the}} filming location for the scene in which Bond enters MI6's underground headquarters, while the Old Vic Tunnels underneath Waterloo Station in London served as the MI6 training grounds. For the meeting between Q and Bond, production worked during the National Gallery's closing hours at night. The Department of Energy and Climate Change was used in the scene when Bond stood on the roof {{near the end of the}} film. The Vauxhall Bridge and Millbank was closed to traffic for filming the explosion at the MI6 headquarters at Vauxhall Cross. Unlike The World Is Not Enough, which also featured an explosion at the building—which was filmed at a large-scale replica—the explosion in Skyfall was added digitally in post-production. Shooting of the finale was planned to take place at Duntrune Castle in Argyll, but was cancelled shortly after filming began. Glencoe was instead chosen for filming of these scenes. Although supposedly based in Scotland, Bond's family home of Skyfall was constructed on Hankley Common in Surrey using plywood and plaster to build a <b>full-scale</b> <b>model</b> of the building.|$|E

It deals with two main questions: 1) Is the application of <b>full-scale</b> <b>modelling</b> to be restricted to the West only? 2) what are the possibilities, constraints and fields of application - with attention to the methodological validity and technical solution for <b>full-scale</b> <b>modelling</b> in Vietnam? It is argued that since <b>full-scale</b> <b>modelling</b> is based on people-environment interaction, it should, in principle, apply to studies about people-environment relation anywhere on earth. On the methodological validity, it is discussed that application of <b>full-scale</b> <b>modelling</b> in Vietnam faces similar methodological problems as encountered in European applications (such as people's behaviour in experiment, ability to understand the abstraction of models, etc.) although at another level as this paper will make clear. However, it {{would be needed to}} design a modelling kit that is of low costs and adapted to the availability of local materials and suitable for the climatic condition of Vietnam.   Two fields of application are projected as most applicable in Vietnam: modelling in architectural education and research investigation. Application for user's participation in the design process will depend on the development of building policy in the country. ...|$|R

Brittle fracture occurred from weld defects (lack of fusion or weld crack) or artificial defects in beam-to-column connections. In accordance with WES 2808, the fracture strain at the beam end in the connection was evaluated.

The equivalent CTOD ratio β was employed to correct the constraint loss in structural components {{on the basis of the}} Weibull stress criterion.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} the {{relationship}} between Virtual and <b>Full-scale</b> <b>Modeling</b> will be traced back. A number of publications supports the dissemination of existing knowledge resp. experiences. Although a se-ries of biannual EFA-Conferences (European <b>Full-scale</b> <b>Modeling</b> As-sociation) produced a remarkable number of useful papers, the "scientific output " beyond this platform remained to be {{so far in the}} dust of gray literature. On the other hand the rapid growing interest for computer applications and tools rediscovered the working area of 1 : 1 simulation more or less the other way around. Although the term VR in the nineties was strongly occupied by computer-interfaces resp. -representations, soon the insight gained in importance that reality is by far more complex than some 10. 000 polygons. Furthermore, some kind of unproductive competition resp. defense of good old modeling tra-ditions versus promising computer technology seemed to act as the main activity. However, the fusion of Virtual and <b>Full-Scale</b> <b>Modeling</b> could indefinitely serve as a promising field of research. 1...|$|R

We are currently participating in an interdisciplinary research project which aims to combine and compare various visualization methods and techniques, among others, <b>full-scale</b> <b>modelling</b> and virtual reality, in design processes with users. In this paper, we will discuss virtual reality as a design tool in light of previous experience with <b>full-scale</b> <b>modelling</b> and literature on cognitive psychology. We describe a minor explorative study, which was carried out to elucidate the answers to several crucial questions: Is realism in movement a condition for the perception of space or can it be achieved while moving through walls, floors and so forth? Does velocity of movement and reduced visual field {{have an impact on the}} perception of space? Are landmarks vital clues for spatial navigation and how do we reproduce them in virtual environments? Can “daylight”, color, material and texture facilitate navigation and are details, furnishings and people important objects of reference? How could contextual information clues, like views and surroundings, be added to facilitate orientation? Do we need our other senses to supplement the visual experience in virtual reality and what is the role of mental maps in spatial navigation?...|$|R

Rigid, reductivist and confrontational methods based on static geometry, prejudice and competition are to be replaced by dynamic, interdisciplinary and integrative models. In his current art practice the author simulates existing architectural spaces whose interior are re-designed into sculpted environments, based on creative irregularity rather than idealised geometry. All the computer simulated “soft” environments can be realised on an architectural scale as temporary installations with the curved surfaces approximated through planar polygons cut from sheet materials.
