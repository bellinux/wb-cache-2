The maximum safe dose of protactinium {{in the human body}} is 0.03 ÂµCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231Pa.

5|$|In {{the years}} after the fire One Meridian Plaza {{stood in the middle}} of Philadelphia vacant. The fate of the {{building}} was up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>as</b> the building's owners and the insurance company prepared for ligation on how to proceed with repairs, who would control those repairs, and at what cost. E/R Partners were proposing deconstructing the building down to the 19th floor and rebuilding from there. Aetna Corporation, the fire insurer, claimed that girders above the 19th level could be repaired and used cutting $115 million in repair costs from the owner's $250 million estimate. Aetna also proposed taking over the reconstruction. E/R Partners spent $50 million securing One Meridian Plaza and spent up to $500,000 a month on security guards, utilities and inspections by engineers as the building stood empty.|$|E
5|$|On the {{edition of}} SmackDown! {{following}} The Great American Bash, Eddie Guerrero revealed the secret {{he had been}} keeping; he was Dominick's real father, not Rey Mysterio (was thought to be). At SummerSlam, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a ladder match, where {{the goal is to}} climb a ladder to retrieve an object that is suspended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>As</b> per pre-match stipulations, Mysterio gained complete custody of Dominick. On the September 9 edition of SmackDown!, Guerrero defeated Mysterio in a steel cage match to end the feud. Guerrero then began a feud with Batista when Guerrero was given a title match at No Mercy. Guerrero, however, died unexpectedly of heart failure on November 13, 2005. In 2006 Guerrero was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Mysterio, his nephew Chavo Guerrero, and Chris Benoit.|$|E
5|$|Rebirth and {{realms of}} {{existence}} are foundational teachings of Mahavira. According to the Acaranga Sutra, Mahavira comprehended life {{to exist in}} myriad forms, such as animals, plants, insects, water bodies, fire bodies, wind bodies, elemental forms, and others. He taught that a monk should avoid touching or disturbing {{any one of them}} including plants, never swim in water, nor light a fire or extinguish it, nor thrash their arms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>as</b> such actions can torment or hurt other beings that live in those states of matter.|$|E

5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>as</b> much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches {{for the same reasons}} as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
5|$|Water is a {{chemical}} substance that {{is composed of}} hydrogen and oxygen and is vital for all known forms of life. In typical usage, water refers only to its liquid form or state, but the substance also has a solid state, ice, and a gaseous state, water vapor, or steam. Water covers 71% of the Earth's surface. On Earth, it is found mostly in oceans and other large water bodies, with 1.6% of water below ground in aquifers and 0.001% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>as</b> vapor, clouds, and precipitation. Oceans hold 97% of surface water, glaciers, and polar ice caps 2.4%, and other land surface water such as rivers, lakes, and ponds 0.6%. Additionally, a minute amount of the Earth's water is contained within biological bodies and manufactured products.|$|E
5|$|Whitehead assumed {{command of}} the Fifth Air Force in June 1944, {{although}} he remained subordinate to Kenney. In the Battle of Leyte, MacArthur attempted to move forward beyond the range of land-based aircraft. A long battle of attrition then began {{on the ground and}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air,</b> <b>as</b> the Fifth Air Force struggled to gain the upper hand with inadequate numbers of aircraft that could be based on Leyte. Gradually, Whitehead gained the upper hand. He was promoted to lieutenant general on 5 June 1945.|$|E

5|$|The Victor B.2 {{featured}} a distinct {{change in the}} aircraft's engine arrangements; incorporated into the right wing root was a Blackburn Artouste airborne auxiliary power unit (AAPU), effectively a small fifth engine. The AAPU was capable of providing high-pressure air for starting the main engines, and also providing electrical power {{on the ground or}} alternatively <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>as</b> an emergency back-up in the event of main engine failures. The AAPU also acted to reduce the need for external specialist support equipment. Turbine-driven alternators, otherwise known as ram air turbines (RATs), had been introduced on the B.2 to provide emergency power in the event of electrical or hydraulic power being lost. Retractable scoops in the rear fuselage would open to feed ram air into the RATs, which would provide sufficient electrical power to operate the flight controls. In the event of engine flameout RATs would assist the crew in maintaining control of the aircraft until the main engines could be relit.|$|E
5|$|The earguards are in {{the shape}} of silver ears, and the neckguard is {{decorated}} with a scrolling leaf pattern. Six detached cheekpieces were found within the helmet bowl along with the disintegrated remains of a seventh, although only two would have been needed. Hinges were also found, as was the pin of one cheekpiece, which had been bent. It may have been forcibly removed or possibly sustained damage at a later date, perhaps from a plough. It is unclear why there were so many cheekpieces accompanying the helmet; it is possible that they may all have been used on the same helmet to customise its appearance on different occasions, or alternatively they may have been intended as spares in the event of damage. The surviving cheekpieces are very elaborate. Five of the cheekpieces show equestrian scenes; one depicts the triumph of a Roman emperor on horseback, holding his arm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>as</b> he is crowned with a laurel wreath by the goddess Victoria (Victory). A cowering barbarian is depicted below being trampled by the hooves of the emperor's horse. Another less well-preserved cheekpiece depicts a possibly Middle Eastern figure holding a large cornucopia, and a Roman helmet and shield below.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins on}} a city {{sidewalk}} where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth. As Scherzinger begins to undress, the men stop to stare as she begins taking off her glasses and shaking her hair back. The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later, {{dressed in a black}} body suit with a cape. As the chorus begins, the situation rapidly switches back-and-forth from Scherzinger in her good-girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits (and Beagle Boys masks) to Scherzinger in her bad-girl persona fighting with police. As the song progresses, Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle, with a streaking white and black background. Several shots of her bad-girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown. As the bridge begins, she is shown in her good-girl ego standing by a podium, talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> <b>As</b> the bridge ends, she brings her hands down, blowing back all of the reporters, who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song. The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away.|$|E

25|$|Pesticide use {{raises a}} number of {{environmental}} concerns. Over 98% of sprayed insecticides and 95% of herbicides reach a destination other than their target species, including non-target species, air, water and soil. Pesticide drift occurs when pesticides suspended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> <b>as</b> particles are carried by wind to other areas, potentially contaminating them. Pesticides {{are one of the}} causes of water pollution, and some pesticides are persistent organic pollutants and contribute to soil contamination.|$|E
