40|$|Abstract. Interest in {{dependency}} parsing increased {{because of}} its efficiency to represent languages with flexible word order. Many research have applied dependency-based syntactic analysis to different languages and results {{vary depending on the}} nature of the language. Languages with more flexible word order structure tend to have lower performances compared to more fixed word order languages. This work presents, for the first time, a dependencybased parsing for Tagalog language, a free word order language. The parser is tested using manually assigned POS and auto-assigned POS data. Experiment results show an average of about 78 % accuracy on unlabeled attachment scores, and about 24 % on complete dependency scores. As the position of the sentence head is not fixed, we look into sentence <b>head</b> <b>accuracy</b> as assigned by the parser. Results show that around 83 %- 84 % of the sentence head are assigned correctly...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} effects of 2 manual therapy interventions on cervical spine range of motion (ROM), <b>head</b> repositioning <b>accuracy,</b> and balance in patients with chronic cervicogenic dizziness. Design: Randomized controlled trial with 12 -week follow-up using blinded outcome assessment. Setting: University School of Health Sciences. Participants: Participants (N= 86; mean age ± SD, 62. 0 ± 12. 7 y; 50 % women) with chronic cervicogenic dizziness. Interventions: Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of 3 groups: sustained natural apophyseal glides (SNAGs) with self-SNAG exercises, passive joint mobilization (PJM) with ROM exercises, or a placebo. Participants each received 2 to 6 treatments over 6 weeks. Main Outcome Measures: Cervical ROM, <b>head</b> repositioning <b>accuracy,</b> and balance. Results: SNAG therapy resulted in improved (P≤. 05) cervical spine ROM in all 6 physiological cervical spine movement directions immediately posttreatment and at 12 weeks. Treatment with PJM resulted in improvement in 1 of the 6 cervical movement directions posttreatment and 1 movement direction at 12 weeks. There was a greater improvement (P<. 01) after SNAGs than PJM in extension (mean difference, - 7. 5 °; 95 % confidence interval [CI], - 13 ° to - 2. 0 °) and right rotation (mean difference, - 6. 8 °; 95 % CI, - 11. 5 ° to - 2. 1 =) posttreatment. Manual therapy had no effect on balance or <b>head</b> repositioning <b>accuracy.</b> Conclusions: SNAG treatment improved cervical ROM, and the effects were maintained for 12 weeks after treatment. PJM had very limited impact on cervical ROM. There was no conclusive effect of SNAGs or PJMs on joint repositioning accuracy or balance in people with cervicogenic dizziness...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of co-ingesting carbohydrate and caffeine (CHO+CAF) in comparison to carbohydrate (CHO) and placebo (PLA), during a reliable soccer-specific test (Currell et al, 2009). 8 university-standard soccer players ingested a PLA, a 6. 4 % CHO or 6. 4 % CHO and 160 mg CAF (CHO+CAF) solution on three occasions, in a double-blind randomised cross-over design, with each trial separated by 7 days. The protocol was 90 min in duration, made up of ten 6 min exercise blocks, each followed by soccer-specific skills tests (agility, dribbling, <b>heading</b> and kicking <b>accuracy).</b> Dependant variables (Agility, dribbling, <b>heading,</b> kicking <b>accuracy,</b> glucose, lactate, HR and RPE) were analysed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA.

Blood glucose increased (p= 0. 01) in the CHO trial compared to PLA, with no difference (p> 0. 05) between CHO+CAF and CHO. No significant difference (p> 0. 05) was reported for HR and RPE values across all trial conditions. Skill performance during simulated soccer activity improved with CHO+CAF supplementation in comparison to both CHO and PLA.

40|$|Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) {{inertial}} sensors {{are commonly}} used in applications such as inertial navigation or human motion tracking.

The dynamic accuracy {{is in the form}} of a root-mean-square (RMS) error and is only valid for certain motions, which are not specified.

40|$|Abstract Background Although {{cervical}} pain is widespread, most {{victims are}} only mildly and occasionally affected. A minority, however, suffer chronic pain and/or functional impairments. Although there is abundant literature regarding nontraumatic neck pain, little focuses on diagnostic criteria. During the last decade, research on neck pain {{has been designed}} to evaluate underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, without noteworthy success. Independent researchers have investigated postural balance and cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility among patients with chronic neck pain, and have (in most cases) concluded the source of the problem is a reduced ability in the neck's proprioceptive system. Here, we investigated cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility and postural balance among patients with nontraumatic chronic neck pain. Methods Ours was a two-group, observational pilot study of patients with complaints of continuous neck pain during the 3 months prior to recruitment. Thirteen patients with chronic neck pain of nontraumatic origin were recruited from an institutional outpatient clinic. Sixteen healthy persons were recruited as a control group. Cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility was assessed by exploring <b>head</b> repositioning <b>accuracy</b> and postural balance was measured with computerized static posturography. Results Parameters of cervicocephalic kinesthetic sensibility were not reduced. However, in one of six test movements (flexion), global repositioning errors were significantly larger in the experimental group than in the control group (p Conclusion In patients with nontraumatic chronic neck pain, we found statistically significant global repositioning errors in only one of six test movements. In this cohort, we found no evidence of impaired postural balance. <b>Head</b> repositioning <b>accuracy</b> and computerized static posturography are imperfect measures of functional proprioceptive impairments.

30|$|The {{proposed}} landmark-aided approach {{improves the}} <b>heading</b> estimation <b>accuracy</b> from two aspects. First, the improved RMPCA {{approach is developed}} for user heading estimation without landmarks.

This aspect can also be verified by the heading estimation result comparisons between the improved RMPCA and RMPCA approaches. Second, we not only deploy landmarks for direct user heading recalibrations, but also for device attitude estimation recalibrations, which may render more accurate extraction of the horizontal accelerations. This is also {{the reason why the}} proposed landmark-aided approach performs better than that of landmark-aided improved RMPCA without device attitude recalibration.|$|R
