40|$|Abstract — Microalgal {{culture may}} have the {{potential}} {{as a source of}} raw materials for biodiesel to provide renewable energy services for regional and remote communities. However, current culturing systems face many technical hurdles to be economically feasible, such as high costs for microalgae harvesting and difficulties to make algal cell accumulating lipids. Biochar is an inherent product of biomass pyrolysis; it is a carbon rich and porous substance with high surface area and many surface charges. Biochar could thus be utilised to absorb nutrients and attract and immobilise algae to its surfaces, providing an effective method to alleviate the algae harvesting challenge. In this study, an Oil Mallee biochar of varying particle sizes were added to Chlorella vulgaris culture in a Tris-Acetate-Phosphate (TAP) medium to investigate the biochar – algae interaction. Algae growth were severely inhibited when biochar was added at inoculation phase, whereas, adding biochar at later stages of the exponential or stationary growth phase has less or no effect on the algal culture. Based on these observations biochar was tested as <b>filtration</b> <b>aid</b> for algae harvesting. When C. vulgaris was gravity-filtrated using a filter paper of 11 µm pore size, the algal mass on filter was increased from 4. 7 % of total biomass in the control sample to 8. 2 % in a 0. 2 g/ 100 mL biochar treated sample. Interestingly, the cellular lipids contents (determined in the form of fatty acid methyl ester) increased by 40 % in the biochar treated culture as compared to the control. The lipid accumulation was thought to have resulted from the stress induced by biochar stripping phosphorus from the medium. These findings provided a scientific basis for an innovative use of biochar to improve the efficiency of the algal culture system and further research to reveal the detailed mechanism of biochar – algae interaction was discussed.

40|$|The agro-industries {{generate}} {{thousands of}} tons of by-products, such as cereal bran or sugar beet pulps, each year. For instance, in the Walloon Region, wheat transformation industry produces about 200, 000 t of bran annually. Most of those by-products are, at best, used for cattle feeding. Through biocracking, this biomass may however constitute a renewable source for various value-added molecules of interest. These include dietary fiber, proteins, antioxidants, etc. The Feruzyme project focuses on ferulic acid, a major example of the hydroxycinnamic acids. These phenolic compounds show excellent antioxidant ability, and are found in relative abundance in cereal bran (about 6. 6 mg. g- 1, dry basis, in wheat bran). Ferulic acid (along with other hydroxycinnamic acids) is in majority (usually about 80 %) ester-linked to other constitutive elements of the cell wall, namely arabinoxylans. Its enzymatic release depends mainly on the breaking of its ester linkage by Ferulic Acid Esterases (FAE, EC 3. 1. 1. 73), which works in synergy with arabinoxylan-degrading enzymes (hemicellulase, including xylanase). Cellulase and even protease may also help by "unweaving" further the complex, cross-linked structure of bran cell-wall. The aim of our project is to design a process, starting from raw wheat bran to obtain purified ferulic acid, either crystallized or in concentrated solution. Furthermore, this process should be feasible at pilot scale, as it is meant to commercial application. Bran pre-treatment may impact the efficiency of the enzymatic action, by facilitating the access of the enzymes to their substrate (grinding, micronisation), or by modifying cell-wall structure (extrusion, steam-explosion, etc. processes involving non-enzymatic hydrolysis). The composition of the bran may also be altered, for instance by destarching, but also by pearling, this process being able to separate richer layers within the bran. Simpler process, like fine sieving of ground bran, is sufficient to eliminate part of the starch (wheat bran starch granules are usually about 20 µm). Purified FAE are still not commercially available. However, several enzyme complexes do present FAE activity: Depol™ 740 l (Biocatalysts), Pentopan™ 500 BG and Novo™ 188 (Novozymes), Pectinase™ PE (Catalysts), Grindamyl™ S 100 (Danisco), etc. These complexes are used as <b>filtration</b> <b>aid</b> or for bread making. FAE activity is usually a side activity, the major being hemicellulase and cellulase, except for Depol™ 740 l in which FAE activity is standardized (36 U. g- 1).

The aim of this work was to monitor the distribution of some toxic heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) zinc (Zn), iron (Fe) and arsenic (As) during craft beers production (three types of beer produced in four different breweries). The instrumental method adopted in this investigation was inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The collected results demonstrated how a very low (μg/L) heavy metal contamination (mainly Cr, Zn and Cu) was provided by raw materials (water, malt, hops and yeasts) and that these toxic metals mostly pass into the residuals (spent grains, hot trub and yeasts), so only a negligible fraction of them can be detected in beer. For example, treating hops with a high dose of pesticides containing Cu did not cause an increase in its content in final beer because a large part of copper remains in hot trub. Furthermore, the filtration phase caused the increase in the concentration of Cd, Zn, Fe and As, probably due to the use of <b>filtration</b> <b>aids.</b> These increases were insignificant healthwise [[URL] edqm. eu/en/Metals-and-alloys-used-in-food-contact-materials- and-articles- 1 st-Edition-(CouncilofEurope, 2002) ].

40|$|Membrane {{filtration}} is {{a popular}} solid/liquid (S/L) separation process used in water and wastewater treatment, since it {{plays a key role}} in removing from water complex components such as dissolved and particulate matter contaminants. Membrane filtration processes are used as an alternative to other more traditional separation methods, such as simple filtration, centrifugation, sedimentation etc., since they offer the advantages of a highly selective operation, separation with few auxiliary materials, ambient temperature operation, usually no phase changes; the process is also economical in small units, it is modular in construction and may be easily integrated in existing production processes, requiring relatively low capital and running costs. Fouling is the major factor limiting membrane lifetime. Fouling is a generic term, which describes the gradual deterioration of membrane performance in terms of permeation flux and selectivity, mainly due to the accumulation of solids on its surface and/or inside its pores. Several techniques have been implemented to prevent the particles reaching the membrane surface, which include the use of abrasives, <b>filtration</b> <b>aids,</b> and coagulants. On the other hand, feed pre-treatment, ultrasonic fields, periodic backflushing, and gas sparging are used to remove particles that already have been deposited in the membrane pores or on its surface. Flotation is another S/L separation process, in which the lifting force of bubbles (usually of air) is used for the removal of suspended matter from dispersions. The process is widely applied to the removal of organics from water, the removal of metal ions, oils, powders, and residual reagents from wastewater etc., as well as for the beneficiation of mineral particles in minerals processing. A combination of membrane filtration and air sparging integrated into a single unit could reduce fouling by removing a large part of the solid particles: the rising gas bubble swarm acts as a surface scrubber, preventing the solid particles from being deposited on the membrane surface and also scrubbing the membrane surface and removing the deposited cake. This combined process could be further improved if a surface-active agent was added to the suspension, making the solid particles hydrophobic: most of the solid particles would then be removed by flotation at the top of the cell by the rising bubbles. The innovative hybrid flotation/microfiltration system consists of a membrane module submerged inside a flotation column. A suspension of fine-sized adsorbent particles was fed into the hybrid cell, where the solid particles were partially removed by flotation, while clean water was obtained from the membrane module. Some of the solid particles remaining in the dispersion were deposited on the surface of the membrane, forming a cake that gradually caused membrane fouling. The rising gas bubbles were used for the flotation process, while at the same time acting as membrane-surface scrubbers, effectively removing the deposited cake and countering the fouling problem. Process parameters investigated were: the nature, size, and concentration of solid particles (zeolite, hydrotalcite, Zn(OH) 2 precipitate and iron colloidal particles), the type and concentration of selected ions (Zn 2 +, P-PO 4 3 -), the type and concentration of flotation reagents, the effect of gas flow rate and of solid-liquid dispersion flow rate, and the frequency and length of backflushing, which was required in order to reduce the fouling of membranes and to extend their useful working time, among others. ...|$|R

The results showed that PrekotAC presents a lower pressure drop across the P 84 compared to PTFE filter media under various material loadings. This is because of its different characteristics that effect the porosity of the filter media and allow a higher volumetric airflow passing through, resulting in lower pressure drop compared to PTFE filter media. In addition, the diversity in terms of particle size distribution of the formulated PrekotAC that increase its permeability property helps to reduce the pressure drop across the media and its filter cake.

40|$|Membrane fouling is a {{key factor}} that {{significantly}} contributes {{to the performance of}} membrane bioreactors (MBR). Aeration is commonly applied in MBRs to control the rate of fouling. In applications where aeration is not a feasible option, such as in anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs), limiting fouling could be a challenge. Transverse membrane vibration could potentially improve the performance of such systems by promoting shear enhancement at the membrane surface and reducing the rate of fouling. In this thesis, the impact of transverse vibration on fouling limitation was studied using model solutions (yeast, bentonite, alginate) and complex feed (secondary effluent) from an AnMBR. During the fundamental study of filtration with model solutions, it was found that transverse vibration has great potential in limiting cake formation. However, the impact of it on internal pore fouling was found to be limited. It was estimated that the power required for the membrane displacement was similar in magnitude to that utilized by aeration to limit fouling. Further improvement in the performance of the transverse vibration was studied by optimizing operating parameters (frequency and displacement). Although increasing both frequency and displacement further reduced the rate of fouling, {{it was found that the}} improvement was dependent on the resulting shear rate rather than the individual parameter. The impact of fiber arrangement and distance between fibers was also studied using a high concentration of yeast. It was found that during filtration with vibration, the performance of the system was not as sensitive to the close vicinity of the fibers, even at high feed concentrations. As reported in literature, the vortices generated by the fibers in close proximity interact, hence potentially increasing the shear rate and providing better fouling limitation. As reported in literature with MBR feed, a two stage fouling phenomenon has also been observed with transverse vibration <b>aided</b> <b>filtration</b> of supernatant from an AnMBR. Investigation into fouling mechanisms during vibration showed that the initial stage of a slow gradual increase in transmembrane pressure due to internal fouling was prolonged. Critical flux was also found to remain constant when the MLSS concentration of the feed was increased during filtration with transverse vibration. The performance of the system when using transverse vibration was found to be better than that observed with crossflow velocity (CFV) or gas sparging under similar flow conditions. It was also found that the fouling which occurred during filtration with vibration was more reversible than that incurred with CFV and gas sparging. Filtration performance with transverse vibration was further improved when coupled with either periodic backwash or relaxation. However, periodic backwash during transverse vibration <b>aided</b> <b>filtration</b> increased the irreversible fouling incurred. Structural loads imposed on the fiber due to vibration were also studied using simulations. It was found that the stresses imposed on the membrane based on the conditions used in this study, were much lower than that required for fiber failure...|$|R
50|$|To {{extract the}} alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred {{with a hot}} {{solution}} of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over {{a period of about}} two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a filter cloth in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the filter cloth. Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away {{from the surface of the}} filter cloth and facilitates <b>filtration.</b> However, filter <b>aid</b> is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of filter aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the bottom and pumped to the filter.|$|R
40|$|Bachelor?s {{thesis is}} divided into two parts, a {{theoretical}} part and a practical part. The theoretical part of this thesis covers; problems in the field of providing protective tools, employers responsibilities connected with providing these tools, knowledge about kinds and choices of <b>filtration</b> and isolation <b>aids</b> for airway protection and knowledge about aids for ear protection. The theoretical part is processed by a secondary analysis of technical literature, legal rules, technical articles and website resources. Quantitative research is used in the practical part of this thesis. Questioning is a chosen method and a questionnaire is a method for collecting data. The questionnaire was completed anonymously and was created only {{for the purpose of this}} thesis. At first, a pre-printed questionnaire was handed over for completion to employees of chosen companies via safe technicians. Employees had 7 days to complete the questionnaire. It consisted of 15 closed questions. The respondent could choose from two to three suggested answers and one answer where the respondent could answer by his or her own words. The criterion for the choice of companies for this research was a requirement that employees at workplaces had to use personal protective tools. Two companies were chosen of which one runs a foundry and the second deals with the production of building components. Both companies want to be presented anonymously. Workplaces of both companies indicate the risk of noise for our ears and chemical polutant nad dust in the air for our airways. The data are processed by means of computer programmes; Microsoft Office Word and Microsoft Office Excel. Statistical tables and graphical illustration are used to evaluate the data. The results are interpreted in absolute numbers and percents. The aim of the thesis is to create an overview of protective tools used for the protection of airways and ears within chosen worplaces, and to find out the convenience of used tools due to their efficiency which was set by a producer. Furthermore, the aim is also to find out whether protective tools are used during work, whether employees keep regular maintenance of protective tools and finally whether the breaks at work are observed. Four hypotheses are given: Hypothesis no. 1 : Employees in an observed group, who have to use personal protective working tools, use the right types of tools. The hypothesis no. 1 was confirmed after evaluation of used protective tools considering recorded levels of noise, dust and chemical substances at workplace and with taking professional structure and answers of the respondents into consideration. Hypothesis no. 2 : Employees in an observed group, who have to use personal protective working tools, really use these tools. The hypothesis no. 2 was also confirmed on the basis of the answers of employees. Hypothesis no. 3 : Employees in an observed group, who have to use personal protective working tools, carry out regular maintenance and change of these tools. According to all the respondents in the survey, 67 % of respondents do not make change of tools which protect their ears until the tool is damaged. Furhermore, 57 % of employees do not make change of tools which protect their airways until it is damaged. The hypothesis no. 3 was disproved Hypothesis no. 4 : Employees in an observed group,who have to use personal protective working tools, observe safety breaks at work. In the company B the safety breaks were not established. That is the reason why it was not possible to confirm or disprove the hypothesis no. 4. The results of this survey will be handed over to the employers of certain companies. On the basis of data gained in the survey,the heads of the companies have materials which they can use for change in scope and content of course trainings considering personal protective working tools and safety breaks...|$|R
40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} the {{understanding}} of the factors that determine the performance of baghouses used for milk powder collection. The research focuses specifically on the similarities and differences between milk powder collection and other common baghouse applications. The thesis also aims to demonstrate the value of recent developments in computational fluid dynamics in developing predictive models of baghouse performance. It is hoped that the findings of the thesis may find application in the New Zealand dairy industry, where such baghouses are commonly used to collect milk powder after spray drying. The effect of operating temperature and humidity on the performance of baghouses was investigated by examining both the forward filtration process and pulse cleaning process. Forward filtration was examined in a series of bench scale experiments, then scaled up to the pilot scale to confirm the findings. The effect of humidity on the pulsing performance was then investigated at the pilot scale. The importance of pulse system design was investigated at the pilot scale in a separate set of experiments. Pulse nozzle position, pulse pressure, and pulse duration were varied and the effect on the baghouse pressure differentials was measured. A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) filter model designed for membrane filtration was adapted with some success to simulate a milk powder baghouse. The model was successful in predicting the length of the low pressure zone {{at the top of the}} bag, and the general trends in overpressure associated with changes to the pulse system geometry. The model was not successful in predicting the acceleration of the filter bag during the pulse. The model was used to simulate both forward filtration and pulsing, to extend the results of the experimental investigation. The effects of changes in the pulse nozzle height, pulse nozzle diameter, and pulse pressure were simulated, as well as the effect of gravitational settling during forward filtration, to extend the results of the previous experiments. There is a clear opportunity remaining for further work to extend the basic model developed here and to adapt the model to simulate large industrial baghouses. Experiments on the bench scale and pilot scale indicated that increased cohesive forces between particles improve the performance of milk powder baghouses by lowering the resistance of the filter cake during forward <b>filtration</b> and <b>aiding</b> cake removal during pulse cleaning. Under the conditions typical of industrial milk powder baghouses, cohesive forces are governed primarily by liquid bridging between particles, due to melted fat (particularly at high temperatures) and softened lactose (at high humidity levels). As a range of milk powders with different compositions are produced commercially, the relative importance of lactose-based and fat-based cohesion differs between powder types. Cohesion promotes the formation of porous structures in the filter cake, improving the cake permeability. In skim milk powder (SMP), particle cohesion is dominated by softened lactose, and is highly moisture dependent. In the bench scale experiments conducted here, increasing the relative humidity from 6 % to 17 % decreased the specific cake resistance from 1. 69 x 10 ⁹ m. kg¯¹ to 8. 23 X 10 ⁸ m. kg¯¹, and decreased the proportion of powder adhering to the filter from 14 % of the total supplied powder to 3 %. The combination of these effects decreased the total resistance over the filter from 1. 09 X 10 ⁹m¯¹ to 1. 89 X 10 ⁸; m¯¹, an 83 % reduction. The low deposition at high humidity suggested that the porous cake structure formed at high humidity levels was fragile, so that deposited particles were prone to subsequent dislodgement, especially in areas where the shear velocity near the filter surface was high. In pilot scale experiments, the porous cake structure formed at high humidity was more easily removed from the filter bag, resulting in more effective pulse cleaning. It was concluded that particle cohesion promoted cake filtration over depth filtration, as particles tended to adhere to the cake surface immediately upon contact. As depth filtered particles are more difficult to remove, the shift toward cake filtration at high humidity improved the pulse cleaning performance. A high-fat milk protein concentrate (MPC) powder was also filtered on the bench scale apparatus. Particle cohesion in the MPC powder was dominated by liquid fat, and showed a clear dependence on temperature but not on humidity. Increasing the temperature from 30 °C to 90 °C caused the specific cake resistance of the MPC to decrease from 1. 06 x 10 ⁸ m⁻¹ to 3. 94 x 10 ⁷m⁻¹, a 63 % decrease. The deposition of MPC powder was unaffected by either temperature or humidity. Gravitational settling of particles in large baghouses was found to produce significant variations in the properties of the filter cake throughout the baghouse. Experimental results with the pilot scale baghouse found a strong decreasing trend in the particle size with increasing height in the baghouse, with the mean particle size decreasing from 117 μm at the bottom of the baghouse to only 31 μm near the top of the filter bag. The filter cake thickness also decreased sharply with height. Results from the CFD simulations indicated that in the pilot scale baghouse particles larger than 120 μm in diameter tend to fall out of the air flow and collect in the bottom of the baghouse, instead of depositing on the filter. While industrial baghouses tend to have a higher elutriation velocity than the pilot scale baghouse used in this study, the large size of industrial baghouses provides ample opportunity for particles to segregate on the basis of size. In addition, bench scale results indicated that high air velocities near the filter surface may cause particles to rebound from the filter. This may occur in industrial baghouses in the region near the inlet, where the air velocity is highest. The reverse pressure differential induced in the filter bag by a cleaning pulse was found to increase with distance from the cell plate. Positioning the nozzle too close to the bag opening created a low pressure zone just beneath the cell plate, where the pressure remained lower inside the bag than outside throughout the pulse. This may lead to poor cleaning at the top of the bag. In the pilot scale baghouse, positioning the nozzle at least 0. 7 m from the bag opening eliminated the low pressure zone. The optimum distance of 0. 7 m is is dependent on the nozzle type and bag diameter, but can be directly applied to recent industrial baghouse designs in the NZ dairy industry, which have the same nozzle type and bag diameter as the pilot scale baghouse. The design of the pulse cleaning system is important in achieving good baghouse performance. Increasing the pulse tank pressure on the pilot scale baghouse from 3. 5 bar to 6. 5 bar caused a 30 % reduction in the forward pressure differential after the pulse, while decreasing the pulse pressure below 3. 5 bar caused the pressure differentials to increase indefinitely. Altering the nozzle position had no effect on the overall pressure differentials, but did alter the local acceleration at different points on the filter bag during a pulse. CFD simulations indicated that decreasing the distance between the nozzle and the bag opening from 0. 7 m to 0. 1 m increased the overpressure at the bottom of the bag from 770 Pa to 3500 Pa, but this was offset by the appearance of the low pressure zone at the top of the bag as mentioned above. CFD simulations indicated that the diameter of the pulse nozzle altered both the mean bag overpressure generated by the pulse, and the distribution of the overpressure over the bag surface, with the low pressure zone at the top of the bag becoming longer at large nozzle diameters. The pulse duration was found to be unimportant, with experiments on the pilot scale baghouse finding that this had no effect on either the overall baghouse pressure differentials or the length of the low pressure zone at the top of the bag. The project has extended the understanding of milk powder baghouse performance by relating the moisture-dependent properties of lactose and the temperature-dependent melting of dairy fats to baghouse performance. The project has also provided a useful design tool in the form of the CFD model. The project demonstrates an opportunity for further CFD research into baghouse design, as the basic model developed here could now be modified to directly simulate large industrial baghouses. It is hoped that the results from this thesis will find application in the New Zealand Dairy Industry...|$|R
