5|$|In Grenland, the {{metropolitan}} area surrounding Skien, {{there was a lot}} of opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used the nearby Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible for them to make money on the Skien–Oslo route; despite that, it operated from Skien to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola. In 1993, Norsk Air announced that it would no longer fly from Skien, and would focus all their operations at Sandefjord. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. In 1994, the company had a revenue of NOK7.5 million, and a NOK1 million profit.|$|E
5|$|Bramblestar's Storm, {{the seventh}} volume in the Super Edition arc, {{features}} Bramblestar, {{the leader of}} ThunderClan. The book takes place after the Clans' victory over the Dark Forest cats. This book was released on 26 August 2014. All Clans are struggling due to the lake flooding; however, ThunderClan and ShadowClan appear to be suffering most. Deaths of Clanmates leads to tension and grief between those in ThunderClan as they simultaneously also try to survive outside of their usual territory, having been displaced by the flooding. On a border patrol, Bramblestar encounters some housecats that are taken into the Clan until they can return home. Bramblestar becomes close {{to one of the}} housecats, Jessy, which upsets Bramblestar's deputy (and former mate) Squirrelflight causing many quarrels between them. Ultimately, two of the housecats, Minty and Jessy, decide to leave, leaving only Frankie (later named Stormpaw) with ThunderClan. Jessy leaves because she feels that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> Bramblestar and herself do not become mates because Bramblestar’s heart belongs with Squirrelflight. In the short manga chapter included at the book's end, it is revealed that Squirrelflight is pregnant with Bramblestar's kits.|$|E
25|$|Teddy Air was {{established}} in 1989 and began services from Skien to Fornebu the following year, initially using a Britten-Norman Islander. There {{was a lot of}} local opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used Sandefjord Airport. Norsk Air stated {{that it would not be}} possible for them to make money on the Skien–Oslo route; Widerøe chose to operate out of Sandefjord and from 1993 closed its operations at Geiteryggen. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, using an Embraer 110, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. Coast Air was also awarded a concession on the route to Bergen.|$|E

25|$|Republican {{senators}} {{said they}} {{voted against it}} because it was unenforceable, a position also taken by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Obama administration. However, the DOD and the White House stated they agreed with the intent of the legislation and suggested <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> it was broadened to prohibit the use of arbitration in cases of sexual assault for any business contract, not just federal contractors. Senators explained their vote against the legislation by saying it was a political attack on Halliburton and that the Senate shouldn't regulate contracts. The latter argument is countered with many examples of similar restrictions on contractors such as discrimination, bonuses and health care. Others felt it was unconstitutional and that arbitration is useful in resolving disputes, often faster, privately and cheaper.|$|E
500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American R singer Mary J. Blige featuring Beyoncé from the former's tenth studio album My Life II... The Journey Continues (Act 1) (2011). It was written by Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Sean Garrett and Menardini Timothee while production was handled by Garrett, Team S. Dot and BridgeTown. Originally written for Beyoncé's fourth studio album 4 (2011), the singer felt {{that it did not}} fit with the sound she had created for her album, and she thought that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> she recorded it as a duet with Blige instead.|$|E
500|$|Approximately {{one year}} later, a rumor was {{circulated}} that Hugh Clark, a Kensington school director who was Catholic, was visiting a girls school, where he {{demanded that the}} principal stop Bible reading in school. The story also claimed that the principal refused {{and that she would}} rather lose her job. Clark denied this version of events and claimed that after finding out several students had left a Bible reading to read a different version of the Bible, he commented that if reading the Bible caused this kind of confusion, that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> it were not to be read in school. Protestants claimed that Catholics, with direct influence from the Pope, were trying to remove the Bible from schools.

500|$|During the {{recording}} process of Rebel Heart, Madonna enlisted several collaborators, including MoZella, Symbolyc One and Toby Gad. Madonna posted {{a photograph of}} the trio working with her in a recording studio on her Instagram account. She said on the photograph, [...] "Having an Iconic Moment in the studio with Toby-Mozilla and S1. My throat hurts from singing, laughing and crying." [...] Gad worked with Madonna on fourteen songs, twelve appeared on the album's multiple track lists, with one being [...] "Iconic". According to Gad, [...] "The first week she was quite intimidating. It was like a test phase. You have to criticize, but you can't really offend. But she also likes honest, harsh critics to say things as they are. It worked out really well and she got sweeter and sweeter." [...] For the track, she initially asked American rapper Jay Z to be featured on with verses about icons, however he called American rapper Chance the Rapper and said that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> somebody that was a new person and that he thought that could be a new icon got on the record. Chance and Madonna had met before through American recording artist Frank Ocean in a concert and became friends, prompting the singer to accept Jay Z's suggestion.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of 1994, the K Foundation {{attempted}} to interest galleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. The Tate, in Liverpool, {{wanted to be part of}} the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. [...] "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do." [...] Cauty: [...] "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare." ...|$|E

Eventually Glenn said to me, 'Ruud, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> you do these things in midfield.'"

2500|$|African delegates {{arrived in}} Yokohama {{with a number}} of their own well-thought out agendas.

[...] Drawing up a common agenda detailing the trade and investment issues would seem a plausible strategy because the nations of the continent are grappling with similar challenge which include poor infrastructure and trade terms that are weighted heavily against Africa. [...] In a sense, Thabo Mbeki embraced this continental strategy as he suggested that Africa's future economic growth should happen through trade and not aid. Mbeki said, [...] "Without discounting the importance of aid, improved terms of trade for Africa are critical to ensure its full integration into the global economy." [...] He also observed that [...] "market access alone does not always translate in the ability for the developing countries to penetrate competitive world markets." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his rescue, Jonah obeys {{the call}} to prophesy against Nineveh, causing {{the people of the}} city to repent and God to forgive them. Jonah is furious, however, and angrily tells God that this is the reason he tried to flee from Him, as he knew Him to be a just and merciful God. He then beseeches God to kill him, a request which is denied when God causes a tree to grow over him, giving him shade. Initially grateful, Jonah's anger returns the next day, when God sends a worm to eat the plant, {{withering}} it, and he tells God that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> he were dead. God then points out: [...] "You are concerned about the bush, for which you did not labour and which you did not grow; it came into being in a night and perished in a night.

2500|$|Almost immediately, Fripp, McDonald and Michael Giles {{formed the}} first lineup of King Crimson in mid-1968, {{recruiting}} Fripp's old Bournemouth College friend Greg Lake as lead singer and bass player, and McDonald's writing partner Peter Sinfield as lyricist, light show designer and general creative consultant. King Crimson's debut album, In the Court of the Crimson King, {{was released in}} late 1969 to great success: drawing on rock, jazz and European folk/classical music ideas, it is {{regarded as one of}} the most influential albums in the history of progressive rock. The band was tipped for stardom but (due to growing musical differences between Fripp on one side and Giles and McDonald on the other) broke up at the end of its first American tour in 1969. A despondent Fripp offered to leave the group if it would allow King Crimson to survive; however, Giles and McDonald had independently decided that the band's music was [...] "more Fripp's than theirs" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> they were the ones to leave.|$|E
2500|$|To {{prepare for}} the role, De Niro {{consulted}} with Pileggi, who had research material that had been discarded while writing the book. De Niro often called Hill {{several times a day}} to ask how Burke walked, held his cigarette, and so on. Driving to and from the set, Liotta listened to FBI audio cassette tapes of Hill, so he could practice speaking like his real-life counterpart. To research her role, Lorraine Bracco tried to get close to a mob wife but was unable to, because they exist in a very tight-knit community. She decided not to meet the real Karen, saying she [...] "thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> the creation came from me. I used her life with her parents as an emotional guideline for the role". Paul Sorvino had no problem finding the voice and walk of his character, but found it challenging finding what he called [...] "that kernel of coldness and absolute hardness that is antithetical to my nature except when my family is threatened".|$|E
2500|$|Barton started {{mixing the}} album in mid-April 2013, after the {{recording}} {{had just been}} finalized, and mixing was finished {{by the end of}} the month. It was then, that the album's short length, just 35 minutes and 3 seconds, surprised even the band: [...] "It wasn't until we got the masters sessions that we realized, 'Wow, this is like an old Van Halen record'..." [...] Wilton says that it wasn't possible for them to deliver more within the time frame they had, adding: [...] "To tell you the truth, we were at one point considering just doing 5 songs and doing an EP. But, basically, Century Media said <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> we could do an album." [...] Its length would later become a point of criticism, but Wilton has explained that the band prefers to choose quality over quantity: [...] "we don't want to have an album with filler songs. We want every song to be quality. I'd rather have a 35 minute badass album, than a 50 minute long with a bunch of epic songs that really shouldn't have been on the CD." [...] La Torre has added: [...] "We tend to focus on good content, we didn't want to have ten more minutes or fifteen more minutes of music, just to say that we could." ...|$|E

I think their decision was a correct decision. I support their decision. I wish we {{could find a way to}} get money out of politics. I haven't found a way to do that." [...] In January 2012, in the midst of the Republican Party presidential nomination primaries battle, Romney criticized the existence of Super PACs that were playing a large role in the campaign, saying, [...] "I’ll tell you, there have been some—there have been some attacks on me that have just been outrageous and completely inaccurate and have been shown to be inaccurate. That’s the nature of the process. I hope it ends. ... We all would like to have super PACs disappear, to tell you the truth … I think this has to change." [...] A Romney spokesman added at the time that Romney viewed laws limiting regular donations to candidates' campaigns as too restrictive, which resulted in money going to Super PACs instead, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> candidates' campaigns could receive those monies directly and take responsibility for ads made with them.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, after a {{visit to}} a United Methodist Church in Highland Park, Texas, Keillor created a local {{controversy}} with his remarks about the event, including the rhetorical suggestion of a connection between event participants and supporters of torture and a statement creating an impression of political intimidation: [...] "I walked in, was met by two burly security men ... and within 10 minutes was told by three people that this was the Bushes' church and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> I didn't talk about politics." [...] In response, the lecture series coordinator said the two “burly security men” were a local policeman and the church’s own security supervisor, both present because the agreement with Keillor‘s publisher specified that the venue provide security. In addition the coordinator said Mr. Keillor arrived at the church, declined an introduction and took the stage without an opportunity to mingle with the audience, and so did not know when these warnings might have been dispensed. The publicist concurred, saying that Keillor did not have contact with any church members or people in the audience before he spoke. Supposedly, before Keillor's remarks, participants in the event had considered the visit to have been cordial and warm. Asked to respond, Keillor stuck to his story, describing the people who advised him not to discuss politics and saying {{that he did not have}} security guards at other stops on the tour.|$|E
2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> <b>if</b> we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so we were ready. Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once we were ready, it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
