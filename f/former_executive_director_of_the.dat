In March 2006, the UFC announced that it had hired Marc Ratner, <b>former</b> <b>Executive</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nevada Athletic Commission, as Vice President of Regulatory Affairs. Ratner, once an ally of Senator McCain's campaign against no holds barred fighting, became a catalyst {{for the emergence of}} sanctioned mixed martial arts in the United States. Ratner continues to lobby numerous athletic commissions to help raise the UFC's media profile in an attempt to legalize mixed martial arts in jurisdictions inside and outside the United States that have yet to sanction the sport.|$|E

500|$|Some sources {{published}} after Rockwell's death {{question whether}} the government was truly as discouraging as Rockwell claimed. [...] They cite an encouraging April 23, 1943 correspondence with Thomas D. Mabry of the OWI (a <b>former</b> <b>Executive</b> <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Museum of Modern Art). [...] At the time, the three government propaganda agencies were disjointed until they were unified under the OWI on June 13, 1942 by a Presidential Executive Order. Furthermore, the writers' division, led by MacLeish, was under pressure for failing to deliver a message intelligible to people of varying intelligence.|$|E
500|$|... {{he almost}} did win by default. On {{the last day}} for {{candidates}} to file petitions, city officials realized that there were fewer than five candidates running for the five open seats, which would have guaranteed Sarria a seat. By {{the end of the}} day, a total of 34candidates had filed. LCE co-founder Strait began printing the LCE News in part to support Sarria's candidacy. Sarria garnered some 6,000votes in the citywide race, finishing ninth. This was not enough to win a seat but was enough to shock political pundits and set in motion the idea that a gay voting bloc could wield real power in city politics. [...] " [...] put the gay vote on the map", said Terence Kissack, <b>former</b> <b>executive</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> GLBT Historical Society. [...] "He made it visible and showed there was a constituency." [...] As Sarria put it, [...] "From that day on, nobody ran for anything in San Francisco without knocking {{on the door of the}} gay community." ...|$|E
500|$|The April in Paris Ball was {{an annual}} gala event whose {{mission was to}} improve Franco–American relations, to share cultures, and to help provide {{assistance}} to US and French charities, aside from commemorating the 2000th anniversary {{of the founding of}} Paris. It was established by Claude Philippe, the hotel banquet manager, in 1952. While the hotel's management handled invitations and publicity, other details were coordinated by socialites. Elsa Maxwell was given the primary responsibility in organizing it. It was initially held annually in April, but according to Ann Vaccaro, <b>former</b> <b>executive</b> <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ball, it was changed to October because [...] "Mr. Philippe decided that {{because there are so many}} balls in the spring he would make it in October". After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues.|$|E

After being changed to October, it often marked the start of the US fall social season; the balls were major events in the socialite calendar, and raised millions of dollars for American and French charities over the 28 years of its existence. It was staged in the Grand Ballroom at the Waldorf for eight years before moving to the Hotel Astor in 1960, the Seventh Regiment Armory in 1961, and other venues. The ball was designed to cater for [...] "very, very high-class people" [...] according to Vaccaro. Raffle tickets cost US$100 per person and offered opulent prizes such as a US$5000 bracelet and other jewels, expensive furs, perfumes and even cars. It attracted many of the most famous people of the day, including Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich. By the mid 1970s his balls were charging $185 per person; the 1974 ball netted roughly $175,000. During his career at the Waldorf Astoria it has been estimated that Philippe was responsible for his clients spending $150 million alone on banquets.|$|E
