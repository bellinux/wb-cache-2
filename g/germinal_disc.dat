The total number of spermatozoa (trapped spermatozoa plus holes made by spermatozoa) varied between 29 and 164, 000 per egg among species and was significantly and positively correlated with size of the ovum. In most species, holes formed a 'halo' around the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc</b> area and the density of holes was much greater in this region than elsewhere, especially in passerine birds. In some species, a high proportion of holes occurred at some distance from the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc.</b> This seems to be an artefact {{due to the fact that}} some spermatozoa trapped in the outer perivitelline layer undergo proteolytic activity between fertilization and oviposition and create additional holes in the inner perivitelline layer both at and away from the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc.</b> Across all species and within most individual species, the number of trapped spermatozoa was positively correlated with the number of holes in the inner perivitelline layer.

The main differences concerned the granulosa cell layer and the surface layer of the oocyte. In the disc the granulosa cells were less regularly arranged and the spaces between them varied in width. Their mitotic rate was higher than that in the non-disc region, where cell division was seldom observed at maturity. The perivitelline layer was comparatively poorly developed at the periphery of the germinal vesicle in 15 mm follicles, but eventually attained a uniform thickness throughout the follicle. In the intercellular and perivitelline spaces there were smaller amounts of granular material. Marked differences were observed in the ooxyte surface layer. In 15 mm follicles the surface of the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc</b> was thrown into numerous microvilli and some narrow indentations containing macrovilli from the granulosa cells. Coated vesicles, 120 nm diameter, appeared to be invaginating from the oolemma, whereas 70 nm coated vesicles were present in the deeper cytoplasm. In follicles of more than 25 nm diameter these structural conformations were evident only at the periphery of the disc; {{for the most part the}} 120 nm coated vesicles were absent, and over the germinal vesicle microvilli were of rare occurrence. On the other hand, the bulk of the oocyte surface was highly convoluted throughout this period of growth, numerous granulosa cell macrovilli extended into deep pouches associated with 300 nm coated vesicles, and the oolemma possessed a coating of fuzzy material. These observations suggest that there is a restricted passage of yolk precursors to the surface of the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc,</b> and that the inability to transport yellow yolk into the disc is related to differences in the oolemmal surface coat and the population of coated vesicles.

Points of hydrolysis produced by chicken spermatozoa on the inner perivitelline layer of laid and freshly ovulated eggs were viewed as dark holes after staining with fluorescein-conjugated wheat-germ agglutinin. In laid eggs that had been fertilized in vivo, these holes appeared more frequently on the perivitelline layer overlying the blastodisc at the animal pole than on that overlying the vegetal pole. However, in an assay in which fragments of the inner perivitelline layer from freshly ovulated eggs were incubated with spermatozoa in vitro, points of hydrolysis appeared with similar frequency on the perivitelline layer from over the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc</b> at the animal pole or from that over the vegetal pole.

Granulosa cells proximal to the GD are more proliferative, whereas granulosa cells distal to the GD are more differentiated. Previously, we had found epidermal growth factor (EGF) was present in the GD. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that EGF is the GD-derived paracrine factor that stimulates prolif-eration of granulosa cells. Northern analysis, reverse transcrip-tion-polymerase chain reaction, and radioimmunoassay indicat-ed that the GD and granulosa cells but not theca cells are the sources of EGF in chicken preovulatory follicles. However, only the conditioned medium from the GD region (GDR 5 GD 1 overlying granulosa cells) but not the granulosa cell-conditioned medium stimulated proliferation of granulosa cells. Pretreatment of conditioned media with EGF antibody abolished the prolif-eration-stimulating effect of the GDR-conditioned medium. We conclude that EGF {{is one of the}} paracrine factors produced by the GD to stimulate proliferation of granulosa cells.

40|$|Hormones of {{maternal}} origin {{are known to}} be transferred to the egg yolks of oviparous species. Several studies have shown that within and between clutch variation {{of maternal}} androgens may be adaptively tuned. Moreover, it has recently been hypothesized that sex steroids of maternal origin {{may play a role in}} adaptive sex ratio manipulation. For sex determination the eggs have to be incubated to allow the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc</b> to grow and thus extract sufficient DNA. This means that yolk hormone levels are determined after a number of days of incubation and this may hamper interpretation of the data. If yolk utilization or embryonic hormone production are influenced by the sex of the embryo, differences in hormone content at a certain stage of incubation do not reflect the mother's initial allocation. In this experiment we show that testosterone levels in chicken eggs do not change with incubation period. A 4 levels decrease between 3 and 5 days of incubation, which we cannot explain. Male eggs did not contain higher levels of testosterone or androstenedione than female eggs, in contrast to the data reported for another galliform species, the peacock.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{blastoderm}} (fertilized ovum) and unfertilized <b>germinal</b> <b>disc</b> (UGD) {{of fresh}} laid eggs and eggs stored prior to incubation exhibit subtle but definable morphological variations. Such variations {{may lead to}} difficulty when attempting to determine true flock fertility based on {{the appearance of the}} blastoderm/UGD. The objectives of this study were to define and categorize such morphological variations and to determine whether sperm influence the frequency distribution of the different categories. Eleven categories of blastoderms were defined based on the relative density and appearance of the area alba, area pellucida, area opaca, and the periblast. The majority of the blastoderms were included in the first four categories. Unfertilized germinal discs were divided into six categories and were best differentiated from the blasto-derms by the presence of vacuoles around its central dense area. They were also discernible from blastoderms based on their overall denser appearance. Differences in the frequency distribution of some of the UGD categories between virgin and inseminated hens {{may be due to the}} effect that supernumary sperm may have on the organization of the UGD (no fertilization but supernumary sperm present) or blastoderm (fertilized but failed to develop). It is recommended that before starting true fertility determinations during fresh egg breakouts, one should study the appearance of the UGD from virgin hens and then the blastoderm from inseminated hens.

The aim {{was to investigate the}} influence of group size on quail production and reproductive variables. To this end, 360 quails (180 meat and 180 egg-type quails) were assigned in a completely randomized experimental design to one of three treatments with ten replicates each. The treatments consisted of groups with nine, six, or three quails per cage. Birds were observed for three cycles of 14 days. Daily feed intake and feed conversion ratio were influenced (p < 0. 05) by group size in both types of quails. Quail type influenced (p < 0. 05) daily feed intake, feed conversion, and egg weight due to the typical differences between meat and egg-type birds. Despite the observed differences in production parameters, the mean values observed were typical of meat- and egg-type quails. The number of hydrolysis points (holes) per mm² on the vitelline membrane on the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc</b> area was higher in meat quails (2. 89 ± 0. 21) than in egg quails (2. 15 ± 0. 13). This parameter was not influenced by the number of birds per cage, which suggests that the number of males inside the cage did not modify the spermatozoa pool inside the female oviduct.

Strain A comb area correlated with sample fertility (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), flock fertility (P 3 ̆c 0. 05), and relative testicular weight (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Conversely, Strain B relative testicular weight correlated with sample fertility (P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and flock fertility (P 3 ̆c 0. 001). Significant correlations were not found between testicular weight asymmetry and other reproductive traits. Results suggest comb area may be a reliable indicator of male fertility in Strain A...|$|E
40|$|The sperm-egg {{interaction}} was investigated during their reproductive life, in laying quails mated with males {{of different ages}} (Coturnix coturnix sp.). The experimental design was completely randomized in factorial scheme 4 x 4 (age of the females of age x male quail, 80, 160, 240 and 390 days), with 10 replicates and six birds each, in proportion to two females for a male. The results showed {{that there was a}} quadratic effect (P < 0. 05) the amount of sperm trapped in the vitelline membrane of the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc,</b> depending on the age of the females, with a reduction of this number over the old. The age of the females had no effect on egg weight, shell thickness, the percentage of shell and yolk and Haugh unit. As for the egg production was a quadratic effect. The incubation parameters evaluated chick weight, fertility, hatchability and mortality did not differ when analyzed in relation to age of males and females, as well as egg quality and performance of the of the resulting progenies. The chick weight, fertility, hatchability and mortality did not differ when analyzed in relation to age of males and females, as well as egg quality and performance of the of the resulting progenies. The morphology of the genital organs of males and females showed no difference {{in the age of the}} birds. Males and females of laying quails maintain reproductive ability up to 56 weeks. The age of the males had no effect on the reproductive performance and the use of younger males to older females did not result in improved reproductive health. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{initial stages}} of {{development}} depend on mRNA and proteins accumulated in the oocyte, and during these stages, certain genes are essential for fertilization, first cleavage and embryonic genome activation. The {{aim of this study}} was first to search for avian oocyte-specific genes using an in silico and a microarray approaches, then to investigate the temporal and spatial dynamics of the expression of some of these genes during follicular maturation and early embryogenesis. Results The in silico approach allowed us to identify 18 chicken homologs of mouse potential oocyte genes found by digital differential display. Using the chicken Affymetrix microarray, we identified 461 genes overexpressed in granulosa cells (GCs) and 250 genes overexpressed in the <b>germinal</b> <b>disc</b> (GD) of the hen oocyte. Six genes were identified using both in silico and microarray approaches. Based on GO annotations, GC and GD genes were differentially involved in biological processes, reflecting different physiological destinations of these two cell layers. Finally we studied the spatial and temporal dynamics of the expression of 21 chicken genes. According to their expression patterns all these genes are involved in different stages of final follicular maturation and/or early embryogenesis in the chicken. Among them, 8 genes (btg 4, chkmos, wee, zpA, dazL, cvh, zar 1 and ktfn) were preferentially expressed in the maturing occyte and cvh, zar 1 and ktfn were also highly expressed in the early embryo. Conclusion We showed that in silico and Affymetrix microarray approaches were relevant and complementary in order to find new avian genes potentially involved in oocyte maturation and/or early embryo development, and allowed the discovery of new potential chicken mature oocyte and chicken granulosa cell markers for future studies. Moreover, detailed study of the expression of some of these genes revealed promising candidates for maternal effect genes in the chicken. Finally, the finding concerning the different state of rRNA compared to that of mRNA during the postovulatory period shed light on some mechanisms through which oocyte to embryo transition occurs in the hen. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{hormonal}} {{and second}} messenger regulation of plasminogen activator (PA) activities in avian granulosa and theca cells has been documented. However, the physiological role(s) of PAs in the avian ovary remains poorly understood. The present studies {{were designed to}} evaluate PA activity in hen granulosa cells collected from the most mature (F,) preovulatory follicle at three discrete time points relative to a spontaneous ovulation and from follicles collected at various stages of fofficular de-velopment. Levels of PA activity in the granulosa layer of the F, follicle declined by greater than 90 % as follicles were collected closer to their anticipated time of ovulation (e. &, from 17 - 16 h to 0. 75 - 0. 15 h; p < 0. 05). Timing of tissue collection was conllrined by evaluation of serum progesterone levels, which peaked as expected at the 6 - 5 -h time point. During follicular development, PA activity was several times greater in rapidly growing fofficles (6 - 12 mm, 1 - 3 wk prior to ovulation) than in slowly growing (1 - 5 mm) or preovulatory (F 3 and F 1) follicles (p < 0. 05). Granulosa cells of these rapidly growing follicles also incorporated significantiy higher levels of #{ 176 }H-thymidine than did granulosa cells of mature follicles (p < 0. 05), suggesting {{a higher level of}} DNA synthesis. Similarly, granulosa cells of the mitotically active <b>germinal</b> <b>disc</b> region of the F, granulosa layer were found to possess at least 3 -fold higher (p < 0. 05) levels of PA activity and a 2 -fold greater level of 3 H-thymidine Incor-poration than the more mature granulosa cells isolated from the remaining F 1 granulosa layer. These data suggest that avian granulosa cell PA activity, which is predominantly similar to the urokinase form of PA activity, is associated with follicular growth and development. Furthermore, the data argue against a role for PA activity from the granulosa layer of the F, follicle in the process of follicular rupture at the time of ovulation...|$|E
