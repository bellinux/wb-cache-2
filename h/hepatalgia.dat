40|$|Abstract Background Outbreaks of {{hepatitis}} E frequently occur in tropical developing countries {{during the rainy}} season due to overflowing drains, short-circuiting of networks of clean water and use of contaminated water from wells. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) infections are usually accompanied by general symptoms of acute liver disease. This study was conducted to define the clinical and epidemiological aspects of the HEV outbreak that occurred in May 2004 in Bangui. Methods Blood samples were collected from 411 patients aged 1 - 87 years, most of whom presented with jaundice, asthenia or signs of uncomplicated malaria, for a transversal study from June 2004 to September 2005. Patients were recruited at 11 health care centres, including two referral hospitals, after they had given informed consent. The diagnosis of HEV was made with a commercial ELISA test to detect IgM and/or IgG antibodies. HEV RNA was amplified by RT-PCR to confirm the presence of the viral genome. Results The most frequent clinical signs found were jaundice (93. 4 %), vomiting (50. 7 %), <b>hepatalgia</b> (47. 4 %), hepatomegaly (30. 9 %) and asthenia (26. 8 %), which are the general clinical signs of hepatic disease. Acute hepatitis E was found in 213 patients (51. 8 %) who were positive for HEV IgM antibodies. The IgG anti-HEV seroprevalence during this outbreak was high (79. 5 %). The age group 18 - 34 years was more frequently infected (91. 2 %) than those aged 1 - 17 (78. 0 %) or over 34 (64. 9 %) (p - 6). RT-PCR performed on 127 sera from the 213 IgM-HEV-positive patients was amplified, and the presence of the viral genome was found in 65 samples. Conclusion Although no specific clinical signs exist for hepatitis E infection, people presenting with jaundice, vomiting, <b>hepatalgia,</b> asthenia, hepatomegaly or distended abdomen with no signs of uncomplicated malaria in tropical developing countries should be sent to a laboratory for testing for hepatitis E. </p...|$|E
40|$|Fascioliasis is {{a common}} {{parasitic}} disease in livestock in China. However, human fascioliasis is rarely reported in the country. Here we describe an outbreak of human fascioliasis in Yunnan province. We reviewed the complete clinical records of 29 patients and performed an epidemiological investigation on the general human population and animals in the outbreak locality. Our findings support an outbreak due to Fasciola gigantica with a peak in late November, 2011. The most common symptoms were remittent fever, epigastric tenderness, and <b>hepatalgia.</b> Eosinophilia and tunnel-like lesions in ultrasound imaging in the liver were also commonly seen. Significant improvement of patients ’ condition was achieved by administration of triclabendazoleH. Fasciola spp. were discovered in local cattle (28. 6 %) and goats (26. 0 %). Molecular evidence showed a coexistence of F. gigantica and F. hepatica. However, all eggs seen in humans were confirmed to be F. gigantica. Herb (Houttuynia cordata) was most likely the source of infections. Our findings indicate that human fascioliasis is a neglected disease in China. The distribution of triclabendazoleH, the only efficacious drug against human fascioliasis...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{summarize}} the clinical features, diagnosis, {{and treatment of}} sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) and review relevant literature and to improve the clinical diagnosis of this disease. MethodsA retrospective analysis {{was performed on the}} medical histories, clinical manifestations, laboratory results, imaging findings, liver histopathology, treatments, and prognosis of 35 patients with SOS who were hospitalized at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from August 2008 to May 2013. ResultsOf all patients, 31 (88. 6 %) had taken Gynura segetum, 2 had received other traditional Chinese medicines, and 2 had undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The main symptoms included abdominal distention (100 %), ascites (91. 4 %), <b>hepatalgia</b> (62. 9 %), and jaundice (48. 6 %), as well as varying degrees of liver function damage. Ultrasound examination revealed unclear or thinner hepatic veins and slower or no blood flow. CT scans showed map-like heterogeneous enhancement in the liver. Pathological examination demonstrated local sinusoidal congestion, steatosis of some hepatocytes, hemorrhage in some liver tissue, and massive chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in the liver tissue and portal area. After treatment, 15 cases (42. 9 %) showed improvement, and 20 cases (57. 1 %) showed no response and were discharged. ConclusionTaking Gynura segetum is still the main cause of SOS in China. Early diagnosis and timely use of drugs for improving hepatic microcirculation and glucocorticoids are effective in improving the prognosis of SOS...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{develop an}} effectual method for {{treating}} hepatic metas-tasis from rectal cancer. METHODS A randomized control study of celiac artery perfusion plus transcatheter hepatic arterial chemoembolization (TACE) (observation group) and intravenous chemotherapy (control group) for 99 cases with hepatic me-tastasis from rectal cancer was performed. The perfusion was repeated once at 4 {{weeks after the}} first treatment of 52 cases in the observation group, and it was subsequently repeated at an interval of 2 or 3 months. Using intrave-nous administration, the perfusion was repeated once every 3 weeks with 47 cases in the control group. RESULTS Three months after treatment, the patients in the observation group who showed a relief or elimination of a former superior abdominal pain amounted to 70. 6 %, and those with a diminution of their intrahepatic mass reached 55. 8 %. In the control group, the patients with a relief or disappear-ance of <b>hepatalgia</b> reached 20 %, and those with a diminution of their intrahe-patic mass reached 10. 6 %. The 1, 2 and 3 -year survival rates were 80. 8 %, 46. 2 % and 25. 0 % {{in the cases of}} the observation group and 61. 7 %, 19. 1 % and 4. 3 % in the control group, respectively. CONCLUSION For the patients who failed to receive a surgical opera-tion on their hepatic metastasis from rectal cancer, celiac artery perfusion plus TACE is a more effective regimen for improvement of the clinical symp-toms and extension of the survival time, compared to intravenous chemo-therapy, and is a better choice for palliative therapy...|$|E
40|$|Background: Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) is a Chinese patent {{medicine}} {{approved by}} the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration {{for the treatment of}} various types of solid tumors. CKI, combined with transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), is believed to increase the therapeutic efficacy of unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report an updated and extended meta-analysis with detailed outcomes of both the efficacy and adverse events of CKI combined with TACE therapy. Materials and methods: Electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, the Chinese Biomedical Database (CBM), Wanfang, the VIP medicine information system (VMIS) and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), were examined for relevant articles before November 13, 2015. An odds ratio (OR) was used to estimate tumor response, Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) improvement, Child-Pugh improvement, survival rate and adverse events. A publication bias and a subgroup analysis were also assessed. Results: Eighteen studies, with a total of 1, 338 HCC patients who met the criteria for the meta-analysis, were included. Tumor response, KPS improvement and Child-Pugh improvement were significantly enhanced for the combination therapy compared to TACE alone (OR= 1. 84, 95 % CI: [1. 46, 2. 33], P< 0. 00001; OR= 2. 37, 95 % CI: [1. 76, 3. 18], P< 0. 00001; OR= 1. 81, 95 % CI: [1. 08, 3. 03], P= 0. 02, respectively). The combination therapy was associated with an improvement in one-year and two-year survival rates but not an improved three-year survival rate (OR= 2. 40; 95 % CI: [1. 59, 3. 62], P< 0. 0001; OR= 2. 49, 95 % CI: [1. 24, 5. 00], P= 0. 01; OR= 2. 49, 95 % CI: [0. 94, 6. 61], P= 0. 07, respectively). A safety analysis indicated that adverse events (including nausea/vomiting, fever, <b>hepatalgia,</b> increased transaminase, increased bilirubin and leukopenia) were reduced for the combination treatment compared to TACE alone. Conclusion: The combination treatment of TACE and CKI was associated with improved tumor response, KPS and Child-Pugh improvement and improved one- and two-year survival rates in patients with unresectable HCC. The three-year survival rate was not improved. The combination therapy resulted in a reduction in adverse events. The findings of this study should be interpreted with caution because of the small sample size and study limitations...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveTo {{investigate}} the clinical effect {{and safety of}} hepatic arterial infusion of cinobufotalin injection combined with lipiodol chemoembolization (TACE) {{in the treatment of}} Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C primary liver cancer. MethodsA retrospective analysis was performed for the clinical data of 82 patients with BCLC stage C primary liver cancer who were admitted to Department of TCM Oncology in Changhai Hospital from December 2010 to October 2014. According to intraoperative medication, the patients were divided into two groups. The 40 patients in the cinobufotalin group were treated with hepatic arterial infusion with cinobufotalin combined with lipiodol embolism, and the 42 patients in the control group underwent TACE with epirubicin. The objective response rate, time to progression, median survival time, and acute adverse events were compared between the two groups after a single treatment. The t-test was used for comparison of continuous data between groups, the chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical data between groups, and the Kaplan-Meier method was used for the analysis of cumulative survival rate. ResultsAt 1. 5 months after surgery, the cinobufotalin group had a significantly higher objective response rate than the control group (27. 5 % vs 9. 52 %, χ 2 = 4. 429, P= 0. 035). The time to progression was 2. 4 months (95 %CI: 1. 978 - 2. 822) in the cinobufotalin group and 3. 0 months (95 %CI: 2. 260 - 3. 740) in the control group, and {{there was no significant difference}} between the two groups (P= 0. 344). The median survival time was 6. 6 months (95 %CI: 4. 131 - 9. 069) in the cinobufotalin group and 10. 3 months (95 % CI: 0. 089 - 20. 511) in the control group, and there was no significant difference between the two groups (P= 0. 132). At 5 days after surgery, the cinobufotalin group had significantly lower incidence rates of abnormal alanine aminotransferase level, white blood cell count, and platelet count, as well as adverse events including <b>hepatalgia,</b> abdominal distension, and nausea/vomiting than the control group (χ 2 = 6. 193, 5. 311, 6. 096, 5. 909, 4. 761, and 4. 173, all P＜ 0. 05). ConclusionAs for patients with BCLC stage C primary liver cancer, hepatic arterial infusion of cinobufotalin injection combined with lipiodol chemoembolization has a better short-term therapeutic effect, milder adverse effects, and a similar long-term therapeutic effect compared with TACE with conventional chemotherapeutic agents...|$|E
