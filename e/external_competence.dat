40|$|In {{this article}} we will present results from our ongoing {{evaluation}} {{of the central government}} program “The Knowledge Promotion Reform – from word to deed”. The aim of the program is to develop schools as organisations with the purpose of improving the learning environment in order to increase students’ social and intellectual development.   Schools apply to the program on their own initiative (open application) or after encouragement and guidance according to needs (guided application).      An important feature of the programme is the reliance of a cooperation model that involves three parties: one or more schools, school owners and <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> partners. On the basis of qualitative interviews with teachers, headmasters, school owners and <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> partners in two case projects involving several schools, we present findings of the effect of the program on schools improvement capacity and project targets. The schools’ initial improvement capacity and the kind of development support they receive are central groups of factors that influence the outcomes. For concepts and identification of relevant factors, we rely on the school development literature (for e. g. Ekholm, 1989; Hopkins, 2009; Miles, 1965 a). Furthermore we use our qualitative interviews to distinguish between various forms/roles of external support and develop concepts that may increase our understanding of how external support affect the school, particularly the role of the <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> partners. Tentatively we argue that goal-directed strategies intended to change activities directly related to pupils’ learning may lead to better results than means-directed strategies where the link to pupil-related activities is less clear...|$|E

We claim that this improvement effort process consists on sequentially: (1) investing internally, (2) imitating best practices, (3) obtaining <b>external</b> <b>competences,</b> and (4) outsourcing only if previous actions have not improved the activity performance to a satisfactory level.

Teece (2014) disaggregates dynamic capabilities into three core activities: (1) identification and assessment of technological opportunities in relation to customer needs (“sensing”); (2) mobilization of resources to address needs and opportunities, and to capture value from doing so (“seizing”); and (3) continued renewal (“transforming”).|$|R

40|$|The 'Open Skies' policy {{launched}} by the United States in 1992 gave birth to new bilateral agreements between them and most Member States of the European Union, as the latter were adopting a single aviation market. Nevertheless, the nationality clause the agreements included conflicted with the Community principle of freedom of establishment. On November 5, 2002, the European Court of Justice therefore ruled there was indeed violation. However, the true question raised by the agreements focused less on such violation, which was anterior to those agreements, than on their fragmentation and the inequality they created in the Europe/United States aviation relations. Indeed, the issue to be stressed in the judgments {{is linked to the}} building of the <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> of the Union with regards to aviation.

It first considers the status of existing bilateral investment treaties between Member States and third States and the transitional regime established by Regulation (EU) No 1219 / 2012. It then goes on to examine the developing EU policy in respect of investment protection agreements, including the relations between the competence of the EU and that of Member States and Regulation No. 912 / 2014 on Financial Responsibility linked to Investor-State Dispute Settlement, which implies that the EU accepts the principle that future investor protection agreements concluded by the EU will provide for investor-state arbitration. It then goes on the examine the substantive and procedural rules in the investment chapters of the agreements that the EU is negotiating with Canada, Singapore and the United States and the results of the European Commission’s public consultation on such provisions. In light of the current criticism against investor state investment protection and Investor State Dispute Settlement, the article considers the possible future evolution of investor state protection and arbitration, and foresees that the current regime might face considerable changes...|$|E

40|$|In {{the field}} of European Union (EU) {{migration}} policies, {{a large number of}} legal, administrative, and institutional tightening measures have been established in the name of domestic security since the early 1990 s. These measures have been criticized because they allegedly lower the democratic quality of EU migration governance. Yet, the EU seeks to export its rules and regulations beyond its borders to neighbouring third states through its association policies. This article argues that what may be seen as a step back in terms of democratic governance inside the EU may present a step forward in its authoritarian Southern neighbourhood. It explores whether the rules of EU migration can constitute a step toward democratization of migration governance in neighbouring countries, where provisions of transparent, participatory, or accountable decision-making cannot be taken for granted. Taking the example of the Moroccan 2003 law on migration, the paper demonstrates that the EU was fairly successful in inducing the adoption of legislation in line with provisions of democratic governance. The contribution concludes with a discussion of the prospect of implementation of these provisions, in particular, against the background of the EU's extended <b>external</b> <b>competences</b> under the Lisbon Treaty...|$|R
