In May 1893, George proposed, and May accepted. They were soon deeply in love, and their marriage was a success. George wrote to May every day they were apart and, unlike his father, never took a mistress.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his birth, Louis Stanislas was fourth <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the throne of France, behind his father and his two elder brothers: Louis Joseph Xavier, Duke of Burgundy, and Louis Auguste, Duke of Berry. The former died in 1761, leaving Louis Auguste as heir to their father until the Dauphin's own {{premature}} death in 1765. The two deaths elevated Louis Stanislas to second in the line of succession, while Louis Auguste acquired the title Dauphin.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} his elder brother {{effectively}} ended George's naval career, as he was now second <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> succeed to the throne, after his father. George was created Duke of York, Earl of Inverness and Baron Killarney by Queen Victoria on 24 May 1892, and received lessons in constitutional history from J. R. Tanner.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Henry, however, the {{political}} situation in England became less stable, with both Stephen of England and the Empress Matilda laying claim to the throne. Brien had originally been considered a supporter of Stephen, but in 1139 Matilda travelled to England and Brien announced his allegiance to her, joining forces with Miles of Gloucester and other supporters in the south-west. Wallingford Castle was now the most easterly stronghold of the Empress's faction – it was either the closest base to London, or the first <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> be attacked by Stephen's forces, depending on one's perspective.|$|E
5|$|After {{the revolt}} ended in 1174, {{relations}} between HenryII {{and his sons}} continued to be strained. By 1187 Henry the Young King was dead, Richard was <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> inherit, and HenryII {{was on the brink}} of war with PhilipII. In June that year Richard travelled to Paris with PhilipII and struck up a friendship with the French king. Concerned his son might turn against him, HenryII asked him to return. Richard went to Chinon and raided the castle's treasury so he could fund the repair of his own castles in Aquitaine. In 1189 Richard and Philip were wreaking havoc in Maine and Toulouse, capturing HenryII's castles; the king was ill and went to Château de Chinon. He left briefly in July to meet with Richard and PhilipII and agree a truce, and died at Chinon on 6July. The king's body was taken to Fontevraud Abbey and Richard became king.|$|E

5|$|As Mary was {{an infant}} when she {{inherited}} the throne, Scotland was ruled by regents until she became an adult. From the outset, there were two claims to the Regency: one from Catholic Cardinal Beaton, and the other from the Protestant Earl of Arran, who was next <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the throne. Beaton's claim {{was based on a}} version of the late king's will that his opponents dismissed as a forgery. Arran, with the support of his friends and relations, became the regent until 1554 when Mary's mother managed to remove and succeed him.|$|E
5|$|As his father's second son, Alexander {{was third}} <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the throne, {{after his father}} and elder brother, George. His {{education}} was expensive and carefully planned, but while George spent part of his military training in Germany, Alexander was educated in Greece. He joined the prestigious Hellenic Military Academy, where several of his uncles had previously studied and where he made himself known more for his mechanical skills than for his intellectual capacity. He was passionate about cars and motors, {{and was one of}} the first Greeks to acquire an automobile.|$|E
5|$|Charles faced a {{political}} storm over his brother James, a Catholic, being next <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the throne. The {{prospect of a}} Catholic monarch was vehemently opposed by Anthony Ashley Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury (previously Baron Ashley {{and a member of}} the Cabal, which had fallen apart in 1673). Shaftesbury's power base was strengthened when the House of Commons of 1679 introduced the Exclusion Bill, which sought to exclude the Duke of York from the line of succession. Some even sought to confer the Crown on the Protestant Duke of Monmouth, the eldest of Charles's illegitimate children. The Abhorrers—those who thought the Exclusion Bill was abhorrent—were named Tories (after a term for dispossessed Irish Catholic bandits), while the Petitioners—those who supported a petitioning campaign in favour of the Exclusion Bill—were called Whigs (after a term for rebellious Scottish Presbyterians).|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} last four decades of PedroII's reign were marked by {{continuous}} internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither PedroII nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire's political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the death}} of Mary II from {{smallpox}} in 1694, William III restored Anne’s honours, as she was then become next <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the throne, and provided her with apartments at St. James's Palace. He also restored the Earl of Marlborough to all his offices and honours, and exonerated him from any past accusations. However, fearing Sarah’s powerful influence, William kept Anne out of government affairs, {{and he did not}} make her regent in his absences though she was now his heir apparent.|$|E
5|$|George's {{second cousin}} once removed, Queen Anne, ascended the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1702. She had no {{surviving}} children, {{and by the}} Act of Settlement 1701 the English Parliament designated Anne's closest Protestant blood relations, George's grandmother Sophia and her descendants, as Anne's heirs in England and Ireland. Consequently, after his grandmother and father, George was third <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> succeed Anne in two of her three realms. He was naturalized as an English subject in 1705 by the Sophia Naturalization Act, and in 1706 he was made a Knight of the Garter and created Duke and Marquess of Cambridge, Earl of Milford Haven, Viscount Northallerton and Baron Tewkesbury in the Peerage of England. England and Scotland united in 1707 to form the Kingdom of Great Britain, and jointly accepted the succession as laid down by the English Act of Settlement.|$|E

5|$|Henry was by now fully {{determined}} {{to take the}} throne, but presenting a rationale for this action proved a dilemma. It was argued that Richard, through his tyranny and misgovernment, had rendered himself unworthy of being king. However, Henry was not next <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> the throne; the heir presumptive was Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March, who was descended from Edward III's third son, the second to survive to adulthood, Lionel of Antwerp. Bolingbroke's father, John of Gaunt, was Edward's fourth son, the third to survive to adulthood. The problem was solved by emphasising Henry's descent in a direct male line, whereas March's descent was through his grandmother.|$|E
5|$|Hess did {{not build}} a power base or develop a coterie of followers.

He lived in a modest house in Munich. Although Hess had less influence than other top NSDAP officials, he was popular with the masses. After the Invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>to</b> succeed him, after Hermann Göring. Around the same time, Hitler appointed Hess's chief of staff, Martin Bormann, as his personal secretary, a post formerly held by Hess.|$|E
