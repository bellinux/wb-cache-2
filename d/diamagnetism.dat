25|$|Deoxygenated {{hemoglobin}} is paramagnetic; it is weakly {{attracted to}} magnetic fields. In contrast, oxygenated hemoglobin exhibits <b>diamagnetism,</b> a weak repulsion from a magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{structures}} are paramagnetic (have unpaired electrons), not diamagnetic. Thus, a non-intuitive (e.g., a higher-energy {{for at least}} one species) distribution of electrons in the combination of iron and oxygen must exist, in order to explain the observed <b>diamagnetism</b> and no unpaired electrons.|$|E
25|$|The Bohr–van Leeuwen theorem {{proves that}} there cannot be any <b>diamagnetism</b> or {{paramagnetism}} in a purely classical system. The paramagnetic response has then two possible quantum origins, either coming from permanents magnetic {{moments of the}} ions or from the spatial motion of the conduction electrons inside the material. Both description are given below.|$|E
25|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} kind of <b>diamagnetism</b> one would expect in a perfect electrical conductor: according to Lenz's law, when a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. In a perfect conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.|$|E
25|$|John Tyndall FRS (2 August 1820 – 4 December 1893) was a {{prominent}} 19th-century Irish physicist. His initial scientific fame arose in the 1850s from his study of <b>diamagnetism.</b> Later he made discoveries in the realms of infrared radiation and the physical properties of air. Tyndall also published {{more than a dozen}} science books which brought state-of-the-art 19th century experimental physics to a wide audience. From 1853 to 1887 he was professor of physics at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in London.|$|E
25|$|Although Faraday {{received}} little formal education, {{he was one}} of the most influential scientists in history. It was by his research on the magnetic field around a conductor carrying a direct current that Faraday established the basis for the concept of the electromagnetic field in physics. Faraday also established that magnetism could affect rays of light and that there was an underlying relationship between the two phenomena. He similarly discovered the principles of electromagnetic induction and <b>diamagnetism,</b> and the laws of electrolysis. His inventions of electromagnetic rotary devices formed the foundation of electric motor technology, and it was largely due to his efforts that electricity became practical for use in technology.|$|E

The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, S=0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, S is {{on the order of}} 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase. The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, <b>diamagnetism,</b> birefringence, Raman scattering, NMR and EPR can be used to determine S.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Faraday [...] FRS ( [...] ; 22 September 1791– 25 August 1867) was an English {{scientist}} {{who contributed to}} the study of electromagnetism and electrochemistry. His main discoveries include the principles underlying electromagnetic induction, <b>diamagnetism</b> and electrolysis.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{the nearest}} formal {{oxidation}} state of iron in Hb-O2 is the +3 state, with {{oxygen in the}} −1 state (as superoxide [...]O2−). The <b>diamagnetism</b> in this configuration arises from the single unpaired electron on superoxide aligning antiferromagnetically with the single unpaired electron on iron (in a low-spin d5 state), to give no net spin to the entire configuration, in accordance with diamagnetic oxyhemoglobin from experiment.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diamagnetism</b> {{appears in}} all materials, {{and is the}} {{tendency}} of a material to oppose an applied magnetic field, and therefore, to be repelled by a magnetic field. However, in a material with paramagnetic properties (that is, with a tendency to enhance an external magnetic field), the paramagnetic behavior dominates. Thus, despite its universal occurrence, diamagnetic behavior is observed only in a purely diamagnetic material. In a diamagnetic material, there are no unpaired electrons, so the intrinsic electron magnetic moments cannot produce any bulk effect. In these cases, the magnetization arises from the electrons' orbital motions, which can be understood classically as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diamagnetism.</b> When {{placed in}} a {{magnetic}} field the atom becomes magnetically polarized, that is, it develops an induced magnetic moment. The force of the interaction tends to push the atom out of the magnetic field. By convention diamagnetic susceptibility is given a negative sign. Very frequently diamagnetic atoms have no unpaired electrons ie each electron is paired with another electron in the same atomic orbital. The moments of the two electrons cancel each other out, so the atom has no net magnetic moment. However, for the ion Eu3+ which has six unpaired electrons, the orbital angular momentum cancels out the electron angular momentum, and this ion is diamagnetic at zero Kelvin.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Diamagnetism</b> is a {{universal}} property of chemical compounds, because all chemical compounds contain electron pairs. A compound {{in which there are}} no unpaired electrons is said to be diamagnetic. The effect is weak because it depends on the magnitude of the induced magnetic moment. It depends on the number of electron pairs and the chemical nature of the atoms to which they belong. This means that the effects are additive, and a table of [...] "diamagnetic contributions", or Pascal's constants, can be put together. With paramagnetic compounds the observed susceptibility can be adjusted by adding to it the so-called diamagnetic correction, which is the diamagnetic susceptibility calculated with the values from the table.|$|E
2500|$|I.e., {{not only}} [...] and [...] must be {{substituted}} by α and β, respectively [...] (the first entity means [...] "spin up", {{the second one}} [...] "spin down"), but also the sign + by the − sign, and finally ri by the discrete values si (=±½); thereby we have [...] and [...] The [...] "singlet state", i.e. the − sign, means: the spins are [...] antiparallel, i.e. for the solid we have [...] antiferromagnetism, and for two-atomic molecules one has <b>diamagnetism.</b> The tendency to form a (homoeopolar) chemical bond (this means: {{the formation of a}} symmetric molecular orbital, i.e. with the + sign) results [...] through the Pauli principle automatically in an antisymmetric spin state (i.e. with the − sign). In contrast, the Coulomb repulsion of the electrons, i.e. the tendency [...] that they try to avoid each other by this repulsion, would lead to an antisymmetric orbital function (i.e. with the − sign) of these two particles, and complementary to a symmetric spin function (i.e. with the + sign, one of the so-called [...] "triplet functions"). Thus, now the spins would be parallel (ferromagnetism in a solid, paramagnetism in two-atomic gases).|$|E
2500|$|Tyndall's early {{original}} work in physics was his experiments on magnetism and diamagnetic polarity, {{on which he}} worked from 1850 to 1856. His two most influential reports were the first two, co-authored with Knoblauch. One of them was entitled [...] "The magneto-optic properties of crystals, and the relation of magnetism and <b>diamagnetism</b> to molecular arrangement", dated May 1850. The two described an inspired experiment, with an inspired interpretation. These and other magnetic investigations very soon made Tyndall known among the leading scientists of the day. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1852. In his search for a suitable research appointment, {{he was able to}} ask the longtime editor of the leading German physics journal (Poggendorff) and other prominent men to write testimonials on his behalf. In 1853, he attained the prestigious appointment of Professor of Natural Philosophy (Physics) at the Royal Institution in London, due in no small part to the esteem his work had garnered from Michael Faraday, the leader of magnetic investigations at the Royal Institution. About a decade later Tyndall was appointed the successor to the positions held by Michael Faraday at the Royal Institution on Faraday's retirement.|$|E

60|$|The {{mathematical}} {{and experimental}} elucidation of the phenomena of electricity, {{and the study}} of the relations of this form of energy with chemical and thermal action, had made extensive progress before 1837. But the determination of the influence of magnetism on light, the discovery of <b>diamagnetism,</b> of the influence of crystalline structure on magnetism, and the completion of the mathematical theory of electricity, all belong to the present epoch. To it also appertain the practical execution and the working out {{of the results of the}} great international system of observations on terrestrial magnetism, suggested by Humboldt in 1836; and the invention of instruments of infinite delicacy and precision for the quantitative determination of electrical phenomena. The voltaic battery has received vast improvements; while the invention of magneto-electric engines and of improved means of producing ordinary electricity has provided sources of electrical energy vastly superior to any before extant in power, and far more convenient for use.|$|E

50|$|As a {{researcher}} and {{teacher at the}} University of Marburg, 1849-53, he produced valuable experimental demonstrations {{about the nature of}} <b>diamagnetism.</b> Knoblauch's student and collaborator on the <b>diamagnetism</b> work was John Tyndall.

5000|$|The Langevin theory {{does not}} apply to metals because they have non-localized {{electron}}s. The theory for the <b>diamagnetism</b> of a free electron gas is called Landau <b>diamagnetism</b> and instead considers the weak counter-acting field that forms when their trajectories are curved due to the Lorentz force. Landau <b>diamagnetism,</b> however, should be contrasted with Pauli paramagnetism, an effect associated with the polarization of delocalized electrons' spins. For the bulk case of a 3D system and low magnetic fields it can be calculated using Landau quantization, in SI units is: ...|$|E
5000|$|Superconductors in the Meissner state exhibit perfect <b>diamagnetism,</b> or superdiamagnetism, {{meaning that}} the total {{magnetic}} field {{is very close to}} zero deep inside them (many penetration depths from the surface). This means that their magnetic susceptibility, [...] = −1. Diamagnetics are defined by the generation of a spontaneous magnetization of a material which directly opposes the direction of an applied field. However, the fundamental origins of <b>diamagnetism</b> in superconductors and normal materials are very different. In normal materials <b>diamagnetism</b> arises {{as a direct result of}} the orbital spin of electrons about the nuclei of an atom induced electromagnetically by the application of an applied field. In superconductors the illusion of perfect <b>diamagnetism</b> arises from persistent screening currents which flow to oppose the applied field (the Meissner effect); not solely the orbital spin.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diamagnetism</b> is a {{magnetic}} response {{shared by all}} substances. In response to an applied magnetic field, electrons precess (see Larmor precession), and by Lenz's law they act to shield {{the interior of a}} body from the magnetic field. Thus, the moment produced is in the opposite direction to the field and the susceptibility is negative. This effect is weak but independent of temperature. A substance whose only magnetic response is <b>diamagnetism</b> is called a diamagnet.|$|E

50|$|Articles on {{superconductivity}} use Hc2 or Bc2 interchangeably {{since the}} materials are often exhibit perfect <b>diamagnetism</b> (with susceptibility, χ = -1, hence giving equal magnitudes for |Hc2| and |Bc2|).|$|E
50|$|The {{electrons}} in a material generally circulate in orbitals, with effectively zero resistance {{and act like}} current loops. Thus it might be imagined that <b>diamagnetism</b> effects in general would be very, very common, since any applied magnetic field would generate currents in these loops that would oppose the change, {{in a similar way}} to superconductors, which are essentially perfect diamagnets. However, since the electrons are rigidly held in orbitals by the charge of the protons and are further constrained by the Pauli exclusion principle, many materials exhibit <b>diamagnetism,</b> but typically respond very little to the applied field.|$|E
50|$|Diamagnetic {{materials}} are excepted because they exhibit only repulsion against the magnetic field, whereas the theorem requires materials that have both repulsion and attraction. An {{example of this}} is the famous levitating frog (see <b>diamagnetism).</b>|$|E
50|$|With such {{extremely}} strong magnetic fields, {{safety for}} use with humans is unclear. In addition, it would involve avoiding any ferromagnetic or paramagnetic materials near the strong magnetic field required for <b>diamagnetism</b> to be evident.|$|E
