40|$|Introduction. The {{theoretical}} and practical aspects of teaching are generally defined by the curriculum, but professional experience {{plays an important role}} as well. The teaching experience of the faculty members is developed through health services, education and research. The Department of Histology and <b>Embriology.</b> This paper reviews the activities of the teaching staff of the Department of Histology and Embryology, pointing to the importance of pathologic diagnostics and research. It underlines the necessity of using some non-standard histologic staining methods on some tissues, organs and pathogens, as well as the results of experimental studies of the endocrine system. The experimental tumor models are used to demonstrate the interdependence of the endocrine and immune systems. Modalities and possibilities of regeneration of the digestive tract and connective tissue mucosa are explained. This paper also deals with histologic criteria used for assessment of fetal age and in the diagnosis of developmental malformations. Linear and stereologic methods, used in quantification of normal morphology, the degree of pathologic changes, and regeneration of normal structures in the courses of and after therapy, are given. The authors particularly emphasized the importance of abovementioned activities in the teaching of Histology and Embryology to undergraduate students...|$|E

40|$|Generally, {{descriptions}} of the pelvic floor are discordant, since its complex structures and the complexity of pathological disorders of such structures; commonly the descriptions are sectorial, concerning muscles, fascial developments, ligaments and so on. On the contrary to understand completely nature and function of the pelvic floor {{it is necessary to}} study it in the most unitary view and in the most global aspect, considering <b>embriology,</b> philogenesy, anthropologic development and its multiple activities others than urological, gynaecological and intestinal ones. Recent acquirements succeeded in clarifying many aspects of pelvic floor activity, whose musculature has been investigated through electromyography, sonography, magnetic resonance, histology, histochemistry, molecular research. Utilizing recent research concerning not only urinary and gynecologic aspects but also those regarding statics and dynamics of pelvis and its floor, it is now possible to study this important body part as a unit; that means to consider it in the whole body economy to which maintaining upright position, walking and behavior or physical conduct do not share less than urinary, genital, and intestinal functions. It is today possible to consider the pelvic floor as a musclefascial unit with synergic and antagonistic activity of muscular bundles, among them more or less interlaced, with multiple functions and not only the function of pelvic cup closure...|$|E

Uniterms: Cryptorchidism. Ectopic testis. Orchiopexy. Testicular ectopia. Testicular ectopia is an anomaly of testicular descentcharacterized by localization of the testis out of itsnormal migration pathway towards the scrotum. There are known five types of testicular ectopia: superficial inguinal (interstitial), femoral (crural), perineal, pubopenile, and crossed. In crossed testicular ectopia (CTE), the ectopic testis is found in the opposite groin or hemiscrotum, beside the other testis.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine levator palpebralis {{superior}} muscle histologically in patients with congenital blepharoptosis and to investigate the relationship between these findings and age, sex and degree of blefaroptosis in this patient group. Materials and methods: Levator muscle of 13 patients with congenital ptosis, who had applied to Dicle University Medical Faculty Ophthalmology Clinic and had undergone levator palpebralis superior muscle resection between january 2009 -january 2010, has been examined histopathologically in Histology and <b>Embriology</b> Deparment. During preoperative period, ptosis amount, levator function (LF), tear functions, Bell’s phenomenon and jaw-winking phenomenon were evaluated. All patients underwent resection of levator palpebralis superior muscle. Received postoperative levator muscle was examined by light microscopy. Results: The average age of 9 (69. 2 %) male and 4 (30. 8 %) female cases were 10. 61 ± 4. 77 (4 - 19) years. In histological examination, the quality and quantity of the levator muscle fibrils have been assessed. There was no relationship detected between histological features of levator palpebralis superior muscle and patient’s age and gender (p> 0. 05). Patients with weak levator palpebralis superior muscle were detected to have fatty degeneration histologically. The higher the levator palpebralis superior muscle function revealed decreased fatty degeneration and increased skeletal muscle fibrils. Conclusion: More ultrastructural studies in larger populations are needed to support the relationship between structure and function of levator palpebralis superior muscle in patients with congenital blepharoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Com o advento das técnicas de fertilização {{in vitro}} no final da década de 70, abriu-se um debate mundial sobre o estatuto do embrião produzido em laboratório, assim como sua manipulação {{experimental}} na pesquisa científica. O objetivo do artigo é analisar comparativamente dois destes debates no âmbito dos parlamentos britânico e brasileiro. O primeiro resultou na Human Fertilisation and <b>Embriology</b> Act de 1990, e o segundo, nas disposições da Lei de Biossegurança de 2005 relativas às células-tronco embrionárias. A análise, partindo da literatura antropológica sobre o tema, pretendeu demonstrar não só a abertura contemporânea das fronteiras do "humano" a uma negociação explicitamente política, como também os principais vetores que vêm conformando tais negociações no caso da pesquisa científica com embriões humanos. Following {{the arrival of}} in vitro fertilization techniques {{at the end of}} the seventies, a worldwide debate soon flourished on the status of the embryo produced within the laboratory and on its use in experimental scientific research. The purpose of this paper is to analyze and compare two of these debates as they unfolded in the British and Brazilian Parliaments. The former resulted in the 1990 Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act, while the latter led to the provisions of the 2005 Biosafety Law concerning embryonic stem cell research. Exploring the anthropological literature on the topic, the analysis aims to show not only the contemporary opening up of the borders of the 'human' to explicitly political forms of negotiation, but also the main vectors directing such negotiations in the case of scientific research using human embryos...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this review}} {{is to create a}} {{complete}} analysis about tongue-tie (or short lingual frenum or ankyloglossia) according to the most important works published in literature. The analysis allowed us to do a complete evaluation of this problem, from <b>embriology</b> to the therapeutic approach we could use today, focusing our attention on laser-assisted therapy. This review is based on the research on the PubMed Database (www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov) of studies about lingual frenum written in English between January 1980 and May 2014. The keywords inserted were “lingual frenum”, “frenectomy”, “laser therapy”. We have analyzed: case series, case reports, clinical studies, and also literature reviews in which embryology, physiology, diagnosis and treatment of ankyloglossia were described. We excluded laboratory studies, studies based on animal tests and studies about patients with particular syndromes in which we can also find tongue-tie. The selection criteria allowed us to select 42 articles. The treatment options for the releasing of the frenum are surgically represented by frenotomy (i. e. simple horizontal cut of this training) and frenectomy (i. e. removal). In both cases, the intervention on the short lingual frenum is simple, short-lasting, and without particular complications. Furthermore, this kind of treatment can be carried out with different devices: with the typical cold blade scalpel or by the use of laser, a new method that shows more advantages over the prior art. Laser-assisted therapy permits to intervene on newborns (from 0 to 20 days, when there are breastfeeding problems) without total anesthesia and suture. The Er:YAG, CO 2 laser (according to literature data) and Diode laser (according to our experience) are advantageous, safe and effective in tongue-tie treatment...|$|E

Materials and methods: A total of 28 female Wistar albino rats were randomized into four groups: G 1 (n= 7; abdomen was opened and closed), G 2 (n= 7; 0. 1  mL Lipiodol [ethiodized oil] was administered to each uterine horn in conjunction with X-ray irradiation), G 3 (n= 7; 50  mg/kg of intraperitoneal (ip) VC was administered, followed by the administration of 0. 1  mL of ethiodized oil into the uterine horns after  15 minutes), and G 4 (n= 7; 50  mg/kg of ip VE was administered, followed by the administration of 0. 1  mL of ethiodized oil into the uterine horns after 15  minutes). After abdominal closure, rats in G 2, G 3 and G 4 groups were exposed to whole-body X-irradiation three times with 2 -minute intervals at a total dose of 15 – 20  mrad. Three hours after exposure, abdominal cavities of all the rats were reopened and uterine horns were removed. The right uterine horns were embedded into paraffin blocks after fixing in 10 % formaldehyde for histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Uterine horns on the other side were rapidly excised and stored at - 80 °C for the examination of expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and oxidant, antioxidant, apoptotic and antiapoptotic gene expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method. Results: No differences were observed in terms of expression of miRNAs and oxidant, antioxidant, apoptotic and anti-apoptotic gene expression between the study groups. Congestion, epithelial degeneration and malondialdehyde immunoreactivity were significantly lower in G 3 and G 4 groups than in G 2 group; no differences were observed between G 1, G 3 and G 4 groups. Ki- 67 immunoreactivity score was significantly higher in G 2 group when compared with G 1, G 3 and G 4 groups. Caspase- 3 immunoreactivity was not statistically different between the groups.
