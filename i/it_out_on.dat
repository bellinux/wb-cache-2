5|$|Bethe {{managed to}} work <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the train from New York to Schenectady. He {{arrived at a}} value of 1040MHz, {{extremely}} close to that obtained experimentally by Lamb and Retherford. He did so by realising {{that it was a}} non-relativistic process, which greatly simplified the calculations. His paper, published in the Physical Review in August 1947 was only two pages long and contained just 12 mathematical equations, but was enormously influential. Hitherto, it had been assumed that the infinities meant that QED was fundamentally flawed, and that a new, radical theory was required. Bethe demonstrated that this was not necessary.|$|E
5|$|At the department, with April {{absent from}} work, Ron asks Andy {{to fill in}} as an {{assistant}} because the anti-government oriented Ron believes Andy will be ineffective. The two bond {{over the course of}} the day, and Andy begins to tell Ron about his problems with April, for whom he still harbors romantic feelings. Although initially not wishing to get involved, Ron reluctantly tells Andy she is at the hospital and he should visit her. Meanwhile, Ann remains pleasant throughout her nursing shift despite April's constant abuse. The second her shift ends, however, Ann immediately loses her temper and curses at April. Ann apologizes for kissing Andy, but insists it was a mistake and that April should stop taking <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Andy. Later, Andy visits April, who pretends to be asleep but smiles, revealing she is happy he came.|$|E
5|$|At this time, {{unhappy with}} the way his {{collection}} The Round Table, issued in the same year, was being promoted by its publisher, he began to promote his new book himself, partly {{by word of mouth}} and also by getting a friend to publish the chapter on Hamlet in The Times and requesting Francis Jeffrey, editor of the Edinburgh Review, to notice it in that periodical. He had already had it printed privately (instead of offering it directly to a publisher) by his friend the printer Carew Henry Reynell, who purchased the copyright for £100. As a publicity tactic, copies were circulated privately. Finally, Hazlitt got the book published, by Rowland Hunter and the brothers Charles and James Ollier in collaboration, who brought <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> 9 July 1817. It was extremely successful, this first edition selling out in six weeks. A second edition was issued by Taylor and Hessey in 1818, and later that year an unlicensed edition was brought out in Boston by Wells and Lilly. No further editions appeared in Hazlitt's lifetime.|$|E

5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective without a word being said.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{ended with}} an 11–3 record the {{following}} year and comfortably won the East {{for the second year}} in a row. That set up a second straight appearance in the NFL Championship game in Green Bay against the Packers. The teams battled <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> a slippery, mucky Lambeau Field on January 2, 1966. While score was close early on, Vince Lombardi's team held the Browns scoreless in the second half, winning 23–12 in an upset on a Paul Hornung touchdown. Despite Jim Brown's retirement after the 1965 season, the Browns had another four consecutive winning seasons and advanced to the NFL championship game in 1968 and 1969 under Collier, but lost both times.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlement}} at {{the mouth}} of the Plum River was established in 1827 when copper was discovered near the Mississippi River. When the Black Hawk War erupted in 1832, the settlement at Plum River consisted of 25 people. When the settlers were informed of Black Hawk's invasion they were undecided about whether or not to abandon their homes for safer grounds in Galena, Illinois. In the end, while nearby towns such as Hanover emptied of their residents, the citizens at Plum River decided to send the women and children to Galena and leave the men to stick <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the frontier. They partially disassembled two of the settlement's homes and constructed a blockhouse for protection. Left to defend the impromptu fortifications were Aaron Pierce, Vance Davidson, Robert Upton, William Blundell, Leonard Goss and a man known as Hays. On May 19 another group of militia volunteers were ambushed at Buffalo Grove and two days later the more famous Indian Creek massacre occurred (on the same day as the raid at Plum River).|$|E

25|$|On {{the night}} of November 24, Bragg asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat or to stand and fight. Cleburne, {{concerned}} about what Sherman had accomplished, expected Bragg to retreat.

Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the right wing to assist in repelling Sherman.|$|E
25|$|Slag {{may also}} form during smithing and refining. The {{product of the}} bloomer process is {{heterogeneous}} blooms of entrapped slag. Smithing is necessary to cut up and remove the trapped slag by reheating, softening the slag and then squeezing <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, refining is needed for the cast iron produced in the blast furnace. By re-melting the cast iron in an open hearth, the carbon is oxidized and removed from the iron. Liquid slag is formed and removed in this process.|$|E

Shortly after, the ice melted and no further attempts were made to fly the Oionus I.|$|E

25|$|By midnight, Lookout Mountain was quiet. Pettus and Holtzclaw {{received}} orders at 2 a.m. {{to march}} off the mountain. Postwar writings of both Union and Confederate veterans {{refer to a}} brilliant moon, which slipped into the blackness of a total lunar eclipse, screening the Confederate withdrawal. That night Bragg, stunned by the defeat on Lookout Mountain, asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat from Chattanooga or to stand and fight. Hardee counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the left flank of Bragg's army.|$|E
25|$|Although early polling in January had {{suggested}} {{that there was a}} reasonable possibility of a Liberal win should the party contest the seat, the party refused to speculate if they would nominate a candidate until mid-February, and finally ruled <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> 18 February. There had been some speculation that former rugby player Paul Langmack would nominate as a star candidate for the Liberals, but he had announced that he would not run on 7 February. The decision by the Liberal Party not to run changed the dynamics of the race significantly, as with the only threat now from minor parties and independents, Labor became the solid favourite to retain the seat.|$|E
25|$|The first {{definite}} {{mention of}} cricket {{in connection with}} the county is a highly controversial match in 1724 between Chingford and Edwin Stead's XI, which is recorded in The Dawn of Cricket by H. T. Waghorn. The venue is unknown but, if it were at Chingford, it is also the earliest reference to cricket being played in Essex as well as by an Essex team. The game echoed an earlier one in 1718 as the Chingford team refused to play to a finish when Stead's team had the advantage. A court case followed and, as in 1718, it was ordered to be played out presumably so that all wagers could be fulfilled. Lord Chief Justice Pratt presided over the case and he ordered them to play <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Dartford Brent, though it is not known if this was the original venue. The game was completed in 1726.|$|E

25|$|Eight years later, in 1823, Valjean {{has assumed}} a new {{identity}} as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter Cosette, who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labors in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers uses the incident as a pretense to fire Fantine ("At the End of the Day"). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both ("I Dreamed a Dream"). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute ("Lovely Ladies"). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realizes she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and take her to a hospital ("Fantine's Arrest").|$|E
25|$|Parma {{then slipped}} back to eighteenth {{position}} after an Edinson Cavani brace saw Napoli comfortably overcome a Parma side without a win since {{the opening day}} of the season, which led to president Tommaso Ghirardi demanding improvement. Parma then beat Sampdoria at home in thick fog and A.S. Bari away by a solitary goal to nil to shoot up to fourteenth position and ease pressure on Marino, the latter including a wonderful goal from Antonio Candreva. Parma secured a respectable draw at home to early season pace-setters Lazio the next week as ex-Lazio star Hernán Crespo opened the scoring for Parma, netting his 65th league goal for the club, before Luca Antonelli's own goal cancelled <b>it</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> the stroke of half-time. Next up were reigning champions Internazionale who beat Parma by five goals to two, overcoming an early Hernán Crespo brace, who was again scoring against former employers. The Argentinian striker was again on the scoresheet the following week as former manager Francesco Guidolin returned to Il Tardini {{for the first time since}} his summer departure, opening the scoring from the penalty spot with 24 minutes played before Udinese's Antonio Di Natale equalised 11 minutes later. Crespo then put his team back in front for good early in the second half as Parma won 2-1 and scoring his 150th Serie goal. The following week, Parma travelled to Palermo and took the lead inside ten minutes as Alessandro Lucarelli found the net. Parma then surrendered their lead and three second half goals from the Rosanero were enough to see Parma off and the match finished 3–1. The Ducali rounded off their pre-Christmas schedule with home match against rivals Bologna, who proved to be stubborn opposition in a goalless draw.|$|E
