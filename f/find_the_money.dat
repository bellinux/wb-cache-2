5|$|Violet {{explains}} to Corky that Caesar and Johnnie hate each other, and that Gino and Johnnie {{will be coming}} {{to pick up the}} money from Caesar. The plan is as follows: When Caesar has finished counting the money, Violet will get him a drink to relax him before he showers. Corky will be next-door, waiting until she hears Caesar turn on the shower. When he does, Violet will drop the bottle of Scotch that is for Gino and tell Caesar that she is going to buy more.

Corky and Violet think Caesar will be forced to skip town because Gino will assume he has been robbed by Caesar, not his son.|$|E
5|$|There was {{a lull in}} {{building}} after the First World War and social change undermined the construction of rural estate houses. Isolated examples included the houses designed by Basil Spence and built at Broughton Place (1936) and Gribloch (1937–39), which combined modern and traditional elements. The Second World War disrupted the occupation of estate houses, as they were used as wartime schools, barracks, evacuee housing and hospitals. After the war many were outdated, {{with a lack of}} electricity and modern plumbing. There was a shortage of live-in servants and the heavily taxed aristocracy were also unable to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to modernise and maintain large houses. The shortage of building materials in the post-war period also made estate houses valuable resources of stone. As a result, 200 of the 378 architecturally important estate houses have been demolished, were destroyed in the period after 1945, a higher proportion of the total than in England. Included in the destruction were works by Robert Adam, including Balbardie House and Hamilton Palace. One firm, Charles Brand of Dundee, demolished at least 56 country houses in Scotland in the 20 years between 1945 and 1965. The shortage of building materials further reduced the number of new large luxury houses. Isolated examples included Logan House, designed by David Style in the 1950s. In the 1960s there was Basil Hughes's design at Snaigow for the earl of Cadogan and the remodelling of Gask House by Claude Phillimore. This period also saw considerable restoration of existing houses.|$|E

25|$|The {{cost for}} the project is, however, over budget by at least C$35 million and the overall cost could be more than C$1.46 billion because of soaring costs of land used and the {{integration}} of public art into the project. The public art aspect {{of the project was}} neglected in its initial form. Because City Hall regulations for big construction projects require incorporation of public art, City Hall had to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Therefore, the West LRT project cost C$8.6 million more than expected.|$|E

25|$|After {{nearly two}} months, {{at the end}} of November, the kidnappers {{contacted}} Granger, promising that the hostages were alive and well and demanding a ransom of 10 million dollars. The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office had already announced that it was Her Majesty's Government's policy not to pay ransoms, but Granger agreed to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> According to the 2005 article in Kommersant, the management of state-owned telecommunications company Chechentelekom determined that the engineers were {{in the hands of the}} rogue Chechen commander and reputed organized crime figure Arbi Barayev; during the war with Russia, Barayev abducted a group of 29 Russian engineers near Grozny and later exchanged them for a large sum of money.

25|$|This section deals {{primarily}} with Dmitri's wild and distraught pursuit of money {{so he can}} run away with Grushenka. Dmitri owes money to his fiancée Katerina and will believe {{himself to be a}} thief if he does not <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to pay her back before embarking on his quest for Grushenka. This mad dash for money takes Dmitri from Grushenka's benefactor to a neighboring town on a fabricated promise of a business deal. All the while Dmitri is petrified that Grushenka may go to his father Fyodor and marry him because he already has the monetary means to satisfy her. When Dmitri returns from his failed dealing in the neighboring town, he escorts Grushenka to her benefactor's home, but quickly discovers she deceived him and left early. Furious, he runs to his father's home with a brass pestle in his hand, and spies on him from the window. He takes the pestle from his pocket. Then, there is a discontinuity in the action, and Dmitri is suddenly running away off his father's property, knocking the servant Gregory in the head with the pestle with seemingly fatal results.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, Edmonds {{proposed}} a {{volume on the}} occupation in the Rhine Province by British Army on the Rhine (BAOR), to counter a recent German book but the Treasury refused to pay. Edmonds hoped that the War Office would <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> began to collect information from former commanders and staffs of the BAOR and ensured the storage of BAOR records. By 1939, poor offices, lack of promotions and government parsimony, led him to complain that the official history, a national memorial, was being neglected. When Daniel retired in late 1939, Edmonds took on the duties of Secretary as well as Director and on 15 November, the Historical Section was evacuated to St. Anne's on Sea, Lancashire and thence to the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth in April 1942. In February, the Committee for the Control of Official Histories decided to let Edmonds write the volume. R. A. Butler, President of the Board of Education, said that the volume would be useful as a historical background for the Armistice and disarmament terms to be imposed on Germany. In 1987, Bayliss wrote that utility was the main criterion but that it also kept Edmonds busy, having been passed over for {{the writing of the}} official histories of the Second World War. Edmonds was pleased because he saw it as the final volume of his Western Front campaign history.|$|E
500|$|In a list {{compiled}} by the magazine New Statesman in 2006, he was voted twelfth {{in the list of}} [...] "Heroes of our Time". In September 2006, Benn joined the [...] "Time to Go" [...] demonstration in Manchester the day {{before the start of the}} final Labour Party Conference with Tony Blair as Party Leader, with the aim of persuading the Labour Government to withdraw troops from Iraq, to refrain from attacking Iran and to reject replacing the Trident missile and submarines with a new system. He spoke to the demonstrators in the rally afterwards. In 2007, he appeared in an extended segment in the Michael Moore film Sicko giving comments about democracy, social responsibility and health care, notably, [...] "If we can <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to kill people, we can <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to help people." ...|$|E
500|$|At a {{time when}} the most {{convenient}} way to arrive in the town was by sea, a pier was considered to be a necessity. Holdenhurst Parish Council was reluctant to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> and an attempt to raise funds privately in 1847 had only succeeded in financing a small [...] jetty. The Bournemouth Improvement Act of 1856 granted greater financial autonomy to the town and a pier was approved that year. A number of wooden structures were built before an [...] cast iron design by Eugenius Birch was completed in 1880. Under the Act, a board of 13 Commissioners was established to build and organise the expanding infrastructure of the town, such as paving, sewers, drainage, street lighting and street cleaning.|$|E

500|$|Constructing the {{machinery}} {{to realize this}} vision was complicated. Evans struggled to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to pay the highly skilled carpenters needed to construct his complex machines. The nearby flour milling industry on the Brandywine River was large, but dominated by the Quaker millers of Wilmington who saw little potential in Evans's designs. James Latimer, a Newport flour merchant upon hearing Evans's ideas exclaimed [...] "Ah! Oliver, you cannot make water run uphill, you cannot make wooden millers!" [...] Latimer's son, George, however once more saw the promise in Evans's ideas and helped him to secure patent protection over the inventions throughout 1787 and 1788. By this time Evans converted his brothers' mill at Red Clay Creek into a fully automated prototype based on his perfected designs, and the Evans brothers sent handbills and diagrams to the major milling centers of the United States offering free licensing of the designs for the first miller in each county who would commission Evans to refit their mills. Yet this campaign was to prove a major disappointment, and little commercial interest materialized.|$|E

In an attempt to save themselves, Shawn tells the men that David wants them to know where the money is and that they shouldn't harm Raylene; the robbers inform them that Raylene was actually the mastermind of the plan. Shawn and Gus rush back to the cemetery to find Raylene threatening to shoot David if she doesn't get the money. Shawn stalls long enough for the robbers, Juliet, and Lassiter to show up, and David and Raylene are arrested. Shawn then [...] "psychically" [...] locates the money.|$|E
