40|$|I {{formulate}} a phase theory of microcredit market dynamics. The theory is developed and validated using an in-depth multiple case study examining three mature microfinance markets: Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Morocco. I present a specific case study framework {{that is used}} to analyze each of the three markets separately. This framework combines qualitative and quantitative empirical analysis through the evaluation of 12 specific indicators. These indicators are chosen to represent four different market dynamics that are believed to affect microfinance institutions and their performance. A cross-case analysis is conducted to detect similar patterns across the three mature markets, and the findings are summarized into the phase theory. I present a theory of six different phases that a microfinance market goes through from its emergence until the crisis is resolved. Some of the important findings across the three cases are rapid growth, increased bargaining power of consumers and excessive funding to the microfinance institutions, all in the time period leading up to the repayment crisis. In essence, the phase theory predicts that a market that grows beyond what is sustainable and controllable will eventually crash when macroeconomic instability occurs. To make sure a market maintains a sustainable growth, <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>important</b> for the microfinance institutions to focus on long-term profitability over short-term growth. Mechanisms for information sharing are also essential to eliminate the new information asymmetries that arise from introducing competition in microcredit markets.

An innovator introduces something new; an inventor just thinks something up. Maybe you are both. The bridge from fantasy {{to the field}} can be straightforward. In the foreword to Enabling Innovation, the Dutch social scientist Niels Röling pithily observes that scientists see themselves as sources of innovation, {{but it is in}} the transfer and application that the real creativity and hard work lies. That argument is backed up by a fascinating ride through a brilliantly written, almost novel-like, landscape of tales of innovation. They bring together cases in wind energy, computer systems and a wide range of agricultural technologies (mainly on rice) all requiring the spark of human ingenuity. Without that, the author prods, how will the second Green Revolution ever happen? That spark is so often found {{in the hands of the}} small farmer, as Farmer innovation in Africa explains. There are dozens of meticulously detailed cases of how women and men producers have changed methods of plant breeding, soil conservation, cultivation, communication, marketing, you name it, all across the continent.

40|$|In his master's thesis, {{a concept}} within {{stormwater}} management, the green roof, will be examined. The {{first part of}} this thesis is a literature study on the hydrology of extensive green roofs and the factors influencing the hydrological performance of the roofs. This has been done in order to map existing literature and to gain knowledge for the residual work. There is an emphasis on evapotranspiration, which is important for regeneration of the green roofs in between storm events. By measuring soil moisture for the roof, one will gain knowledge on how well the roof release water through evapotranspiration. However, there are uncertainties regarding the sensors measuring soil moisture when used on green roofs. With this in mind, a huge part of this thesis has been to calibrate these sensors, in a laboratory environment. Existing models for evapotranspiration are used to calculate this based on local field data. The factors affecting the green roofs that are being discussed are substrate characteristics, roof geometry, vegetation and the age of the green roofs, as well as the dry weather period prior to a rainfall, seasonal variations and event characteristics. Various models for estimating so-called potential evapotranspiration are presented, and a select few models will be used to calculate this for the green roof field at Risvollan, Trondheim. Along with correct data for soil moisture, the actual evapotranspiration can be calculated. The calibration of the sensors are carried out under stable laboratory conditions. The sensors measure the dielectric permittivity of the material, and by the use of an equation providing the relationship between this and the volumetric water content, the water content is found. At first, a standard calibration were carried out for the two types of substrates that are to be found at Risvollan. It is established that the difference between the substrates are {{to such a degree that}} there s a need for equations specifically for each substrate. The substrates at Risvollan has a depth of 5 cm, and the field roof has additionally two plots without substrate. One plot has a thin felt mat, while the other one has a type of rockwool. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>important</b> to do a calibration specifically for the green roof build-up. This is done in the laboratory as well, in the scale of small boxes of 21 x 23 cm.

40|$|A dissertação pretende fazer uma experiência analítica da historiografia das ciências de Georges Canguilhem, norteada por algumas conclusões obtidas pelo pensador no artigo O Vivente e seu Meio (1946 - 1947). O artigo em questão narra a história de um conceito científico, ou mais precisamente, a composição histórica das variações de uso e sentido que caracterizaram o conceito de meio. Esse conceito inaugurou ao longo de suas reviravoltas e descaminhos entre os séculos XVII e XIX a possibilidade da explicação de uma reação orgânica pela ação de um meio. Estará em jogo, consequentemente, não só a fecundidade histórica do conceito, mas as relações filosóficas entre o meio, entendido como uma categoria historicamente inédita do pensamento, e a individualidade do ser vivo. A dissertação adota o eixo narrativo inicial do artigo de Canguilhem, que recupera a sequência de cinco obras: Princípios de Filosofia (1644), de Descartes; Princípios Matemáticos de Filosofia Natural (1686) e Óptica (1704) de Newton; Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière (1749 - 1788), de Buffon; e Philosophie Zoologique (1809), de Lamarck. Em O Vivente e seu Meio, Canguilhem estende seu recorte histórico até meados do século XX. Nossa análise, porém, concentra-se nas primeiras descontinuidades sofridas pelo conceito. Os desdobramentos do conceito posteriores ao início do século XIX não são objeto de análise na presente dissertaçãoThis work {{aimed to}} make an {{analytical}} experience of Georges Canguilhem s historiography of science, guided by some findings obtained by him in the article Le Vivant et son Milieu (1946 - 1947). Such article narrates {{the history of a}} scientific concept, in other words, the historical composition of the variations of use and meaning which characterize the concept of milieu. This concept inaugurated along its overturns and deviations between the XVII and XIX centuries the possibility of elucidation of an organic reaction by the action of a milieu. In consequence, <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>important</b> to elucidate not only the historical fecundity of the concept, but the relationships between the milieu, understood as a historically new category of reasoning, and the individuality of the living being. In the consecution of this research, the initial axis of Canguilhem s narrative will be adopted, which follows the sequence of five works: Principles of Philosophy (1644), by Descartes; Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy (1686) and Opticks (1704), by Newton; Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière (1749 - 1788), by Buffon and Philosophie Zoologique (1809), by Lamarck. The analysis will be concentrated in the first discontinuities of the concept. In Le Vivant et son Milieu, Canguilhem stretches the frame of his analysis until mid-twentieth.

40|$|The green {{movement}} {{has evolved over}} {{the last twenty years}} from various social, peace and ecology activist organizations into direct political participation in parliamentary institutions through the Green Party. Although there is no definable theory of green politics, the culmination of interacting social movements as well as feminist, decentralist and in many cases, left wing political ideology, has produced a specific kind of political direction for the Greens internationally. As a result of the increased a ttention and awareness given to ecological issues, combined with the heightened evidence of large scale environmental deterioration, public attitudes and government decisions on development and natural resource management have been significantly altered. The Green Party of Canada is still r elatively young in comparison to its European counterparts, although ecologica l awareness and interest in t he {{green movement}} in Canada is strong, as reflected not only in support on a political level for the Canadian Greens I but for environmental issues and a ctivism in general. For this reason <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>important</b> {{to determine whether or not}} the Green Party is a significant aspect of the Canadian green movement, and if in fact its representation is necessary as an active participant in the Canadian political system. The Green Party of Canada, as a vital aspect of the Canadian green movement, and its connection to international green organizations can be examined primarily through the examp l es of both the Canadian Greens and the Green party of Ontario, by using original party documents and literature, information gained through Green party meetings and discussions with members, and commentary by Green theorists where app licable. As well, the influence on the Canadian green movement by the German Green Party is outlined, again mainly through party literature, documents and critiques of the party's experiences. This study reveals several existing and potential problems fo r t he Green Party in Canada, and the political fut ure of the Canadian green movement in general. Some, such as the real i ties of the Canadian political system are external to the movement, and may be overcome with adjustments in goals and methods, and a realization of the changing attitude towards environmental issues in a political context. On the other hand, internal party disfunctions in both organization and direction, caused mainly by the indefinite parameters of green ideology, threaten to exploit the already problematic aspects evident in t he Green Party. Aside from its somewhat slow beginnings, the Green Party in Canada has developed into a strong grassroots social movement, not however from its political visibility but from the steady growth in the popul ari ty of ecological pol i t ics in Canada. Due to the seeming enormity of the obstacles facing the Greens in their effort 4 to achieve electoral success, it is doubtful that Parliamentary representation will be achieved without a major re-orientation of party organization and methods. UI timately the strength of the Green Party in Canada will be based upon its ability to survive as a significant movement, and its willingness to continue to challenge political thought and practice...|$|E

Durante essa fase do desenvolvimento humano ocorrem alterações físicas e cognitivas capazes de influenciar o desempenho funcional. Uma questão importante é diferenciar o limite entre o normal e o patológico, uma vez que além das mudanças comuns durante o envelhecimento, ocorrem mudanças da ritmicidade biológica, como alterações no ciclo vigília-sono, que podem influenciar no desempenho de determinadas tarefas. O objetivo deste estudo foi verificar a influência da idade, do sexo e da hora no desempenho em um teste de labirinto. Foram avaliados 80 indivíduos, 40 jovens (20 homens e 20 mulheres) e 40 idosos (20 homens e 20 mulheres), divididos em 2 grupos que foram testados as 9 : 00 horas e as 15 : 00 horas. Inicialmente foram submetidos à avaliação de saúde e cognitiva e avaliação da qualidade do sono e do cronotipo. Foram orientados a realizar o teste de labirinto cujo tempo de execução foi cronometrado e registrado. Foram observadas diferenças significativas de acordo com idade para o grupo masculino entre idosos na manhã e na tarde e no grupo feminino entre jovens e idosas no teste realizado pela manhã e na tarde. Não foram observadas diferenças significativas de acordo com o sexo e a hora do dia e entre as tentativas. Na comparação entre a 30 ª e a 31 ª, realizadas com intervalo de 15 minutos, foi observada diferença significativa apenas para o grupo de idosos na manhã e na tarde.

Destarte, ? preciso considerar que, al?m da influencia m?tua existente entre os estilos comunicativos dos adultos e o n?vel de desenvolvimento ling??stico infantil, outros fatores podem ter repercutido, como o n?vel socioecon?mico e educacional dos pais das crian?as e das pr?prias educadoras, bem como as suas concep??es sobre o cuidado e o desenvolvimento infantil. Basedon {{the perspective}} of social interaction scholars of language, studies try to analyze interactive contexts between children and adults, focusing the adult s communicative styles and {{its relations with the}} children s language development. Researches suggests that some communicative styles can promote this language development, such as: feedbacks, recasts, fine-tuning, responsivity and joint attention contexts, while others, as directives, are involved in controversies. On the interactive contexts between children and educators at public daycares, the educators linguistic styles are very importants, specially to children who interact with them around 24 months, because this is considered a critical period on language development. Another influence factor is the socioeconomic status, because it has relations with the teachers educational levels, and influence the educators communicative styles and the children s language development. Therefore, this study investigated the child-educator interaction, trying to verify the educator s language styles and the communication of children whose age was between 23 and 25 months, during the interaction. The data was collect at six daycares from Jo?o Pessoa, Para?ba, where six educators interacted with 12 children between 23 and 25 months. In the beginning, the educators were interviewed to establish rapport, to obtain sociodemographics informations and to apprehend their child development s conceptions. After that, the educator-child interactions were systematically observed on dyadic and polyadic contexts of book reading. The interviews data were examined based on the content analysis, proposed by Bardin, while the interactions transcriptions used the norms of the computational program CHILDES (Child Language Data Exchange System), that assisted on the frequencies and percentages calculations of the interactive behaviors. The interactional categories were elaborated considering the theoretical references and the communicative behaviors presented by the children and the educators. The two different interactive contexts implied in differences about the language usage of the teachers. On the dyadic contexts, the educators used almost the double of the utterances presented on the collective contexts, detaching the directives of attention, the assertives end the yes/no questions. Moreover, communicative styles related to the language development promotion, as: Wh questions, praises, recasts and affection s demonstrations, were more frequents on dialogical than collective contexts. On the collective contexts also prevailed the directives of attention and the assertives, however, the assertives were more frequents than the directives and the control directives presented a high incidence when compared with the dyadic contexts. About children communication, <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>important</b> to point out that they presented a language less developed than we expected to their age, as result of the few number of words and word combinations. Therefore, it is necessary to consider that, beyond the mutual influence between the adults communicative styles and the children s level of language development, others factors can have exerted influence on the results, such as the socioeconomic status and the educational level of the parents and the educators, beyond their conceptions about childhood and child development...|$|E

One hundred Mexican-American mothers of preschoolers who participated in the Texas Migrant Council’s Headstart Program were interviewed with regard to demographic information, social support, and problems in life conditions. The results supported the hypothesis that total social support accounts for more variation in maternal acceptancehejection than prob-lems in life conditions alone. Social support accounted for 75 % of the variance in maternal acceptancelrejection of preschool children, and accessibility to support predicted the largest proportion of the variance. The results suggest that <b>it</b> i <b>s</b> <b>important</b> to identify Mexican-American migrant farmworker mothers isolated from social support, since such isolation, in combination with problems in life conditions, places their children at higher risk for maternal rejection.

Safety is non-negotiable, so the balance must be an "and" with other requirements and needs. Pressure to deliver services faster at increasing levels of quality in under-maintained facilities is typical. A challenge for management is to balance the "need for speed" with safety and quality. <b>It</b> <b>s</b> especially <b>important</b> to communicate this balance across the organization - workers, {{with a desire to}} perform, can be tempted to cut corners on defined processes to increase speed. Having a lean staff can extend the time required for pre-test preparations, so providing a safe work environment for facility personnel and providing good stewardship for expensive National capabilities can be put at risk by one well-intending person using at-risk behavior. This paper documents a specific, though typical, operational environment and cites management and worker safety initiatives and tools used to provide a safe work environment. Results are presented and clearly show that the work environment is a relatively safe one, though still not good enough to keep from preventing injury.

Nesse modo de ver, a questão preliminar, ao abordar o tema proposto, refere-se à necessidade da sociedade global proteger juridicamente o Meio Ambiente em sua totalidade. Como conseqüência, constata-se que o campo de estudo do Direito Ambiental vem crescendo e se sofisticando com novos princípios e institutos, cedendo espaço para todos os elementos integrantes dos sistemas ecológicos, inclusive o humano. Aliás, possivelmente, a mais importante característica do Direito Ambiental é a de que seus princípios e normas possuem nítido caráter humanista do imperativo ético da dignidade da pessoa humana. A esse respeito, visando-se a promover um novo olhar sobre o Meio Ambiente é que caminha a presente dissertação de mestrado, ordenando reflexões dedutivas e históricas sobre o tema em sua inerente amplitude, integrando-se os conhecimentos da Ciência Ecológica, do Direito Ambiental e da Ética em torno de um conjunto de problemas e limitações humanas para que o maior bem estar possam vir a ser atingido por todos. De outra parte, torna-se igualmente importante à proteção do Meio Ambiente através do processo educativo.

Indeed, {{issues related}} to the Environment are endless and incredibly up to date, regarding the fact that environmental imbalance gets bigger day after day in a complex scene which is typical of a technological and scientific society that is being formed, threatening the quality of human life, not to mention its own survival. From that viewpoint, the preliminary issue, when approaching the proposed topic, refers to global society s need to juridically protect the Environment as a whole. As a consequence, <b>it</b> <b>s</b> been noticed that the field of study of Environmental Law has been growing and becoming more and more sophisticated with new principles and institutes; making room for every component of ecological systems, including the human one. Possibly, Environmental Law <b>s</b> most <b>important</b> characteristic is that its principles and rules have a sharp humanistic character of the ethic imperative of human dignity. With that respect, aiming at promoting a different look over the environment is the objective of this very master s degree essay, with deductive and historic reflection on the theme in its inherent amplitude, integrating knowledge of Ecological Science, Environmental Law, and Ethics related to a group of human problems and limitations so that all people are able to achieve major well being.
