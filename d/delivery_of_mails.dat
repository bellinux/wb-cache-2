5000|$|Meanwhile, {{there was}} disquiet in Carnarvon about the non-arrival of the mails being carried by Koombana. In a {{telegram}} to the Postmaster-General in Melbourne, Carnarvons town clerk {{complained that the}} monthly <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails</b> had been delayed by eight days. He pointed out that plenty of boats were available, {{at the scene of}} the stranding, to convey them the 70 mi to Carnarvon. Further north, the Port Hedland Advocate called for Shark Bay to be cut off the list of north-west trade calling places, due to its ever-shifting sand banks. [...] However, Koombana was largely forgiven when she arrived in Carnarvon a few days later, even though a quantity of Carnarvon cargo had to be overcarried. Residents and the local media marvelled at the comfort of her cabins, while passengers spoke highly of the efforts of the officers and crew to refloat the stricken vessel. Koombana then covered the 280 mi from Carnarvon to Onslow in the record time of 20 ½ hours.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePostal {{markets have}} been open to {{competition}} {{for a long}} time. But, with a few exceptions, the competitors of the incumbent postal operator are active on the upstream segments of the market-preparation, collection, outward sorting and transport of mail products. With the further steps planned in the liberalization process, there are new opportunities to extend competition to the downstream segments of the market - the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails.</b> In the future, two business models will be possible for the new postal operators: access: where the firm performs the upstream operations and uses the incumbent's delivery network and bypass where the competing firm controls the entire supply chain and delivers mails with its own delivery network. These two options have different impacts on welfare and the profit of the incumbent operator. The choice between access and bypass depends on the entrant's delivery cost relative {{to the cost of}} buying access to the incumbent operator (the access price). In this paper, we derive optimal - welfare maximizing - stamp and access prices for the incumbent operator when these prices {{have an impact on the}} delivery method chosen by the entrant. We show how prices should be re-balanced when the entry method is considered as endogenous i. e. affected by the incumbent's prices...|$|E
40|$|Time is an {{expensive}} resource {{and it is an}} asset to those who respect and use it efficiently. As regards information delivery services, there have been so much delay and loss of information packets in the process of delivery. In this study, we demonstrate the effect of a scheduling algorithm on the speed and reliability of information delivery. Anew decentralized scheduling algorithm and mail delivery and an example of manual mail delivery samples is presented to prove the effect of a proposed scheduling tool on information packets distribution. We useda set of mail information from a private mail bag as locations against some resource agents used in delivering the mail and we applied the algorithm on these locations to see its effects on the time of delivery. The time spam was studied from applying the algorithm and from manually sorting them. The comparism showed differences in the time duration. The research demonstrates the influence of scheduling algorithm on the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails.</b> We concluded that handling mail procedures using a decentralized scheduling algorithm would have great effects on information management and transfer. These effects should be considered in setting up any information services especially, one with many users. Key words:information delivery, mail, scheduling packets, algorithm data sorting...|$|E

But, with a few exceptions, the competitors of the incumbent postal operator are currently active on the upstream segments of the market -preparation, collection, outward sorting and transport of mail products.

40|$|In today’s work environment, {{people are}} {{increasingly}} available {{because of the}} vast distribution of smartphones. This leads {{to a lack of}} real leisure time without being disturbed by phone calls or e-Mail concerning job issues. In the last few years, several large companies in Germany addressed this issue using more or less successful methods like switching off mail servers after working hours or deleting mails received during holidays [Fa 14], [We 14]. Tough, these methods seems to be either too strict or do not provide an accurate solution for the different needs of the different roles in a company. In project SANDRA, we aim at the development of a smart assistant in order to provide non-disturbed leisure time for employees. The assistant will both delay the <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails</b> based on the content (e. g. natural language processing, deep learning) and on additional information such as roles, holiday, or location. In addition, phone calls can be rejected by the assistant. The project also has a focus on privacy aspects and several legal aspects such as labour management regulations and data protection laws. The development will include enterprises for gathering of requirements, continuous testing and optimisation {{as well as for the}} evaluation. For the evaluation of the system, stress levels will be measured based on the heart frequencies of the test users with and without using the system over a longer period of time...|$|E
40|$|The study {{examined}} the view of junior and senior staff of NIPOST regarding staff rationalisation in public service with special reference to Sokoto territory. To achieve this, the {{study examined}} the criteria and reason for staff rationalisation, identifies the category of {{people involved in the}} exercise, investigates whether staff rationalisation has instilled discipline and brought about efficiency and effectiveness in the organisation. This research is based on information obtained from available records, personal observation and interview conducted. The major conclusion drawn from this paper was the main reason for staff rationalisation is to cut down expenses and reduce redundancy of staff to source for money and to prepare the organisation towards commercialisation. Survey results revealed that 70 % of the respondents are of the view that there is improvement in the postal services in areas of <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>mails</b> by postmen. While 30 % agreed that there was no improvement. Available records have shown that 65 junior staff from Sokoto Territory lost their jobs either through retrenchment or dismissal, about 10 senior staff lost their jobs in the same form of termination. Senior Officers in managerial cadre are not affected in the exercise. Most of the respondents believe that there was politics in the whole exercise. Finally, efficiency and effectiveness have not been achieved in NIPOST Sokoto Territory because rationalisation was not properly carried out.
