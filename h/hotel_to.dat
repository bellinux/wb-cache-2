40|$|The {{proliferation}} of self service technologies {{has changed the}} way customers interact with service employees and technology. More consumers are now valuing the convenience, consistency, and the control they have over the self service technologies. However, despite {{the growing popularity of}} these technologies, hotel industries in Singapore have not embraced self service technologies in their day to day operations. Self service technologies present opportunities for <b>hotels</b> <b>to</b> improve on service standards, and the wide variety of technology applications available allow <b>hotels</b> <b>to</b> choose an application that suits the customers and the <b>hotels</b> needs. <b>To</b> enable <b>hotels</b> <b>to</b> seamlessly adopt self service technologies in the servicescape, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that systematically guides hoteliers through the decision process of implementing self service technologies...|$|R
