5|$|Morales' {{second term}} was heavily {{affected}} by infighting and dissent from {{within his own}} support base, as indigenous and leftist activists came to oppose {{a number of the}} governments' reforms. In May 2010, Morales' government announced a 5% rise <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> wage. The Bolivian Workers' Central (COB) felt this insufficient given the rise in the cost of living, and called a general strike. Protesters clashed with police, although the government refused to increase the rise, accusing protesters of being pawns of the right. In August 2010, violent protests then broke out in southern Potosí over widespread unemployment and a lack of investment in infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|This duality {{extends from}} {{individual}} cutsets and cycles to vector spaces defined from them. The cycle {{space of a}} graph {{is defined as the}} family of all subgraphs that have even degree at each vertex; it {{can be viewed as a}} vector space over the two-element finite field, with the symmetric difference of two sets of edges acting as the vector addition operation in the vector space. Similarly, the cut space of a graph is defined as the family of all cutsets, with vector addition defined in the same way. Then the cycle space of any planar graph and the cut space of its dual graph are isomorphic as vector spaces. Thus, the rank of a planar graph (the dimension of its cut space) equals the cyclotomic number of its dual (the dimension of its cycle space) and vice versa. A cycle basis of a graph is a set of simple cycles that form a basis of the cycle space (every even-degree subgraph can be formed in exactly one way as a symmetric difference of some of these cycles). For edge-weighted planar graphs (with sufficiently general weights that no two cycles have the same weight) the minimum-weight cycle basis of the graph is dual to the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph, a collection of nested cuts that together include a minimum cut separating each pair of vertices in the graph. Each cycle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> weight cycle basis has a set of edges that are dual to the edges of one of the cuts in the Gomory–Hu tree. When cycle weights may be tied, the minimum-weight cycle basis may not be unique, but in this case it is still true that the Gomory–Hu tree of the dual graph corresponds to one of the minimum weight cycle bases of the graph.|$|E

25|$|As {{governor}} of Massachusetts {{and as a}} candidate for president, Romney has called for tying raises in the national minimum wage to indicators of growth in the economy, such as increases in the inflation rate.

During late 2015, the House and Senate, in rare bipartisan form, passed the largest infrastructure package in a decade, costing $305 billion over five years, less than the $478 billion in Obama's initial request.
