5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An {{example of such}} a model is the chaotic inflation model of the early universe. Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} has a crystalline shape and illuminated façade with numerous LED lights. Its shape and façade are response to Azerbaijan's special {{request for the}} creation of a widely visible and visually effective landmark as a bridge between Asia and Europe that will be noticed in an international context. The LED lights were upgraded to allow different dynamic lighting scenarios to appear in order to highlight the membrane façade and create moods appropriate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> stages of the events.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} transit circle was a 3-inch Combined Transit and Zenith telescope {{designed by}} Warner & Swasey especially for Illinois. The objective, by John Brashear, {{was held in}} place by a special cell that compensated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> temperature conductivities of the brass and glass so that temperature had no effect on the location or separation of the lenses. Designated as model M-505, the transit included a handing level, micrometer and a built in reversing mechanism. This transit was located in the east-central transit room allowing direct access to the clock room through a small window. The instrument cost $1200 in 1896.|$|E

5|$|Winemakers in New Zealand and Chile {{harvest the}} grapes at various {{intervals}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> blending characteristics that the grape can impart depending on its ripeness levels. At its most unripe stage, the grape {{is high in}} malic acid. As it progresses further towards ripeness the grape develops red & green pepper flavors and eventually achieves a balance of sugars. The flavors characteristic of Sauvignon blanc come from the chemicals methoxypyrazines. Grapes grown in Marlborough's Wairau Valley may exhibit different levels of ripeness over the vineyard, caused by slight unevenness in the land and giving a similar flavor profile to the resulting wine.|$|E
5|$|Another key design {{decision}} {{was to develop}} the concept car based on a new family of common powertrain components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> sources of electricity, but later was renamed Voltec drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain {{is an attempt to}} standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple interchangeable electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric, to fuel cell-powered or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as engine-generator sets (genset) fueled by gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (E100), or flex-fuel (E85). Regenerative braking would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation. In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.|$|E
5|$|During the women's class F35/36 discus competition, {{an error}} in scoring caused the wrong medals to be presented. In this {{combined}} class event, final standings were determined based on a points calculation. The calculation converted distances thrown into points, to account <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> functional impairments of the participating athletes. Due to {{an error in}} the scoring system, {{the gold medal in}} the event was originally awarded to Ukrainian athlete Mariia Pomazan. When the mistake was discovered, the recalculated points showed that Chinese athlete Wu Qing had finished first, with Pomazan in second place. A second medal ceremony was held, which Pomazan did not attend in protest. She was eventually required to return her gold medal.|$|E

5|$|Extensively reared animals may subsist {{entirely on}} forage, but more intensively kept {{livestock}} will require energy and protein-rich foods in addition. Energy is mainly derived from cereals and cereal by-products, {{fats and oils}} and sugar-rich foods, while protein may come from fish or meat meal, milk products, legumes and other plant foods, often the by-products of vegetable oil extraction. Pigs and poultry are non-ruminants and unable to digest the cellulose in grass and other forages, so they are fed entirely on cereals and other high-energy foodstuffs. The ingredients for the animals' rations can be grown on the farm or can be bought, {{in the form of}} pelleted or cubed, compound foodstuffs specially formulated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> classes of livestock, their growth stages and their specific nutritional requirements. Vitamins and minerals are added to balance the diet. Farmed fish are usually fed pelleted food.|$|E
5|$|In its 2014 {{edition of}} the Technology Roadmap: Solar Photovoltaic Energy report, the International Energy Agency (IEA) {{published}} prices for residential, commercial and utility-scale PV systems for eight major markets as of 2013 (see table below). However, DOE's SunShot Initiative has reported much lower U.S. installation prices. In 2014, prices continued to decline. The SunShot Initiative modeled U.S. system prices {{to be in the}} range of $1.80 to $3.29 per watt. Other sources identify similar price ranges of $1.70 to $3.50 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> market segments in the U.S., and in the highly penetrated German market, prices for residential and small commercial rooftop systems of up to 100kW declined to $1.36 per watt (€1.24/W) by the end of 2014. In 2015, Deutsche Bank estimated costs for small residential rooftop systems in the U.S. around $2.90 per watt. Costs for utility-scale systems in China and India were estimated as low as $1.00 per watt.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{a unique}} case among English medieval monasteries that almost nothing has survived of {{what must have been}} a number of books owned by the house as such or in the keeping of {{individual}} monks. These would include at least a small library with biblical texts, spiritual works and perhaps some books on practical subjects, bearing in mind that the management of the abbey plant would have been a considerable challenge. Furthermore, the celebration of the liturgy for a large part of the day and night would necessitate texts <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> participants, who as monks were for the most part not spectators but active participants, some of them with particular roles.|$|E
