40|$|Ammonia and amines (including amino acids) {{were shown}} to {{catalyze}} the formation of sugars from formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde, and the subsequent conversion of sugars to carbonylcontaining products under the conditions studied (pH 5. 5 and 50 degrees C). Sterically unhindered primary amines were better catalysts than ammonia, secondary amines, and sterically hindered primary amines (i. e. alpha-aminoisobutyric acid). Reactions catalyzed by primary amines initially consumed formaldehyde and glycolaldehyde about 15 - 20 times faster than an uncatalyzed control reaction. The amine-catalyzed reactions yielded aldotriose (glyceraldehyde), ketotriose (dihydroxyacetone), aldotetroses (erythrose and threose), <b>ketotetrose</b> (erythrulose), pyruvaldehyde, acetaldehyde, glyoxal, pyruvate, glyoxylate, and several unindentified carbonyl products. The concentrations of the carbonyl products, except pyruvate and <b>ketotetrose,</b> initially increased and then declined during the reaction, indicating their ultimate conversion to other products (like larger sugars or pyruvate). The uncatalyzed control reaction yielded no pyruvate or glyoxylate, and only trace amounts of pyruvaldehyde, acetaldehyde and glyoxal. In the presence of 15 mM catalytic primary amine, such as alanine, the rates of triose and pyruvaldehyde of synthesis were about 15 -times and 1200 -times faster, respectively, than the uncatalyzed reaction. Since previous studies established that alanine is synthesized from glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde via pyruvaldehyde as its direct precursor, the demonstration that the alanine catalyzes the conversion of glycolaldehyde and formaldehyde to pyruvaldehyde indicates that this synthetic pathway is capable of autocatalysis. The relevance of this synthetic process, named the Sugar Model, to {{the origin of life}} is discussed...|$|E
50|$|A tetrose is a {{monosaccharide}} with 4 carbon atoms. They {{have either}} an aldehyde functional group in position 1 (aldotetroses) or a ketone functional group in position 2 (<b>ketotetroses).</b>|$|R
50|$|The aldotetroses {{have two}} chiral centers ("asymmetric carbon atoms") and so 4 {{different}} stereoisomers are possible. There are two naturally occurring stereoisomers, the enantiomers of erythrose and threose having the D configuration {{but not the}} L enantiomers. The <b>ketotetroses</b> have one chiral center and, therefore, two possible stereoisomers: erythrulose (L- and D-form). Again, only the D enantiomer is naturally occurring.|$|R
3000|$|In an {{overview}} published as a tutorial {{one of us}} {{stressed the importance of}} reaction networks close to equilibrium [28]. While oscillators [29, 30], replicators [31 – 33], and self-assembling systems [34 – 39] were seen as traditional ingredients in Systems Chemistry, the chemistry of Dynamic Combinatorial Libraries (DCLs) [40 – 42] offers many new opportunities especially if a coupling with nonlinear feedback elements is envisioned. DCLs are networks of reversible reactions often forming oligomers or cyclic oligomers varying in size and composition. When seeded with a template molecule such networks are adaptive {{in the sense that the}} equilibrium population shifts towards an increased concentration of molecules that bind to the template. While the behavior of such thermodynamically controlled networks may appear easily predictable, even these relatively simple networks already exhibit counterintuitive behavior that can only be rationalized by treating them at systems level. The increase of binder concentration upon addition of a template is often referred to as selection or amplification by supramolecular chemists sometimes causing confusion among theoretical biologists who see these terms intimately connected to a Darwinian process ("survival of the fittest"). Clearly, systems chemistry will need to develop a joint language if the mutually stimulating crosstalk between supramolecular and prebiotic chemistry, theoretical biology and complex systems research is about to create results at the interface between the fields. Indeed this has begun already. A DCL cannot only be harvested by approaching equilibrium but also by pushing into the other direction. Recent examples [43, 44] indicate that a merger between DCL- and replicator chemistry is a strong direction of research within systems chemistry. On the other side, a DCL cannot only be harvested by an autocatalytic reaction taking up one of its components and resulting in the narrowing of the population, it can also be generated by an autocatalytic reaction. Interestingly, an example for such a DCL, albeit never termed as such, is to be found in prebiotic chemistry. The formose reaction, discovered by Butlerow about 150 years ago [45] has been discussed for a very long time as a potential source for the generation of sugars. Under alkaline conditions and in the presence of minerals containing calcium, barium or other divalent ions, formaldehyde reacts to produce a interconverting [...] "sugar library" [...] containing glycol aldehyde, glycerine aldehyde, dihydroxyacetone, as well as aldo and <b>ketotetroses</b> to heptuloses. The library composition is strongly affected by mineral surfaces and additives such as borate as [...] "templates" [...] and/or catalysts [46, 47]. While the autocatalytic nature in the early stage of the reaction is reasonably understood, recipes for the selective harvesting of prebiotic [...] "target molecules" [...] such as ribose (needed for RNA, or perhaps not, see [48]) at the late [...] "library state" [...] of reaction, so far have not been based on autocatalysis. Here is where prebiotic chemistry can learn from the latest supramolecular chemistry.|$|R
