Brown was the co-author and sponsor of a bill that would officially declare China a currency manipulator and require the Department of Commerce to impose countervailing duties on Chinese imports.

He left the service as land inspector in September 1898 due to growing distaste for the British rule over the Lagos Colony and the position of Yorubaland and the Niger Coast Protectorate as British colonies in all but name. Other authors such as Patrick Dele-Cole have noted the abuse of office allegations (leveled by his British superiors) and pursuit of private gain controversy that clouded Macaulay's resignation as surveyor of Crown Grants.Kristin Mann, citing British Colonial Government <b>dispatches,</b> <b>notes</b> that Macaulay behaved dishonestly, by using [...] "his position as Surveyor of Crown Lands to help friends acquire crown grants and persecute enemies by granting their land to others". She further writes that Macaulay [...] "obtained crown grants under false names and then sold them at a profit". [...] In October 1898, he obtained a license to practice as a surveyor. As a surveyor, his plans and valuations included E.J. Alex Taylor's house on Victoria St, Henry Carr's residence in Tinubu, Akinola Maja's house and Doherty villa in Campos Square.|$|R

The next morning several boatloads of Raiders were able to fight the surf and reach the sub; but 72 men, along with just three rubber boats, were still on the island. At 23:30, the attempt by most of the Raiders to reach the submarines failed. Despite hours of heroic effort, 11 of 18 boats were unable to breach the unexpectedly strong surf. Having lost most of their weapons and equipment, the exhausted survivors struggled back to the beach to link up with 20 fully armed men who had been left on the island to cover their withdrawal.

The meaning of the policy, dubiously applied to specific incidents, evolved with the policy of neutrality, but ultimately formed the substance of U.S. responses over the next two years. The commercial British steamship Falaba was sunk in March 1915 by a German submarine with the loss of 111 lives, including one American in the Thrasher Incident. Wilson chose to avoid risking escalation of the war as a result of the loss of one American. In the spring of 1915 a German bomb struck an American ship, the Cushing and a German submarine torpedoed an American tanker, the Gulflight. Wilson took the view, based on some reasonable evidence, that both incidents were accidental, and that a settlement of claims could be postponed to the end of the war.|$|R

40|$|Digitized {{microfilm}} {{of correspondence}} and papers from the Andrew Dickson White collection. The unofficial duties of White's new post are detailed {{in the summer}} correspondence. There are petitions for assistance from stranded Americans, requests for invitations to court functions, and letters of introduction brought by young scholars and travelers who sought White's advice or sponsorship. Russel's reports to White reveal a growing misunderstanding between the two men. White's business activities in a rising stock market were discussed in letters to and from his brother and their associates in Syracuse. Mrs. White's letters from Paris and Homburg present an intimate view of the diplomatic household. Willard Fiske's tour of Iceland was reported in his letters through the autumn, and Jennie McGraw was a guest in the White home at the resort city of Homburg. There {{is a series of}} letters from George Walker, who had been sent by President Hayes to make a special inquiry into opinions in Paris, London, and Berlin on the silver question. Two prominent names that appear on this reel are Clarence King and Francis Parkman.

40|$|Digitized {{microfilm}} {{of correspondence}} and papers from the Andrew Dickson White collection. Though {{he continued to}} give advice, to make faculty recommendations {{to a number of}} educational institutions, and to write and speak on the increase of crime in the United States, White's attention was primarily directed toward diplomatic activity in 1892. His quiet negotiations through Senator Hiscock brought his appointment to St. Petersburg as United States Minister in late July. Much of the correspondence concerned arrangements for his residence in the Russian capital. George Van Ness Lothrop, Charles Emory Smith, and George W. Wurts wrote cordial letters of advice, and several shipping companies sent estimates covering the transfer of household goods. Some American Jewish leaders, who were working with Baron de Hirsch in Europe to help their Russian co-religionists, had supported White's appointment in a direct appeal to the President, and they urged White to look fully into the situation. The official documents of White's appointment were dated August 5. Among letters of congratulation and those dealing with selection of legation personnel are letters from John W. Foster and George Skiras, who had received appointments from President Harrison in recent weeks. There are also notable letters from Eliot, Holls, and Sanborn.
