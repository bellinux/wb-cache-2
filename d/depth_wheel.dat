The hitch is shown as an aftermarket attachment {{mounted on a}} Fordson tractor. It is a fully mechanical version with a <b>depth</b> <b>wheel</b> (small wheel that sets the plow depth). By 1926, Ferguson and colleagues had finished developing and had patented the modern hydraulic three-point hitch. Ferguson sold his hitches and implements during the 1920s and 1930s, and worked with David Brown to produce Ferguson-brand tractors. Not until 1938 would Ferguson finally strike an agreement with Henry Ford to put Ferguson hitches on Ford tractors at the factory—something he had first attempted in 1920 and 1921 at Cork and Dearborn.

40|$|International audienceSurface finish determines {{service life}} of glass workpieces. Therefore, an {{extensive}} polishing phase is usually performed {{to limit the}} local irregularities. In this paper, we propose to investigate {{the influence of the}} grinding parameters on the surface finish of glass samples in order to limit the damages at the earlier stage of the machining process. A central composite design of experiments has been used to define experimental tries that consist of up-grinding or down-grinding glass samples with various feed rate, depth of cut, and wheel speed values. Roughness parameters derived from the Abbott-Firestone curve R(k), R(vk), and the material ratio 100 -Mr 2 have been used to characterize the surface finishes of the ground glass samples. Using the design of experiments, surface responses have been modeled for each roughness parameter to investigate the influence of the cutting parameters. Abbott-Firestone parameters allow a relevant characterization of the glass samples surface finishes. Feed rate increase led to deeper valleys, thus providing a rough surface finish that could potentially shorten workpieces service life. On the contrary, increasing depth of cut tend to reduce valley <b>depth.</b> <b>Wheel</b> speed has shown minor influence on the surface finish. Up-grinding could help obtain less deep valleys than with a down-grinding. However, up-grinding also increases the cutting forces and induces vibrations that led to an increase of the core roughness and eventually to the fracture of the glass sample during the machining. In a material removal context-in opposition with polishing-feed rate should be carefully chosen since it is the most influential parameter on the surface finish. To maximize productivity while obtaining low-valleys surface finishes, an appropriate strategy would consist in down-grinding with a low feed rate, a high depth of cut, and a high wheel speed.

The performance model is one dimensional in the axial direction. It applies a lumped formulation in the thickness direction of the desiccant and the substrate.

The solutions of this model are iterated until the wheel reaches periodic steady state operation.

40|$|This {{study is}} aimed at {{experimentally}} investigating the effect of microgrinding on the integrity of thermally sprayed nanostructured WC/ 12 Co and Al 2 O 3 / 13 TiO 2 coatings and theoretically developing a mechanical model to simulate the machining process of ceramics. A comprehensive microgrinding experiment is designed to {{study the effects of}} the grinding process parameters, such as abrasive grit size, wheel bond type, <b>wheel</b> <b>depth</b> of cut, and workpiece feedrate, on surface finish, subsurface damage, and residual stresses of these coatings. The correlation between the grinding conditions and the integrity of ground samples helps provide an experimental basis for developing a viable microgrinding technique for nanostructured materials and coated samples. A simple X-ray diffraction technique, glancing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD), is introduced to measure the depth profiles of residual stresses in the coatings. The results of the experiment show that the effects of the microgrinding process are limited to the surface layer of ground coatings; the <b>wheel</b> <b>depth</b> of cut is the most influential parameter in the cup-type grinding; ductile flow is the dominant material removal mechanism in grinding n-WC/ 12 Co coatings under all conditions and in grinding n-A 1 2 O 3 / 13 TiO 2 at a low material removal rate, the residual stresses induced by the microgrinding process are compressive, strongly depend on the grinding direction, and show a strong gradient in the thickness direction for both coatings. ^ Based on continuum damage mechanics, a theoretical model is developed for predicting the behavior of ceramics under complex loadings. Unlike the linear elastic fracture mechanics, this damage model includes the effects of cracks, microcracks and inelastic deformation. The model is employed to simulate the damage development in ceramic samples during the machining process using a fourth order isotropic damage tensor. The simulated machining process is similar to the interaction between the abrasive grit and a ceramic sample in surface grinding. The final state of damage and residual stresses in the machined ceramic samples is calculated with this model. The simulation results agree well with the experimental results. ...|$|R
