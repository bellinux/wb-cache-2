The concept has been applied within the field of organisational behaviour to understand a wide variety of complex work contexts and the interaction between individual, group and organisational levels of analysis. More recently, researchers in human factors and ergonomics have similarly argued that there is a need for holistic, <b>integrated</b> <b>accounts</b> of the relationship between macro- and micro- system levels (Karsh, 2003). In order to go some way toward achieving this, we outline two case studies drawn from health care (infection control, electronic medical records) and analyze these using mesoergonomic constructs. The case studies are used to outline a set of steps towards a more general framework for mesoergonomic research...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} part of external or policy shocks is transmitted throughout the economy via various channels of transactions. To analyse such channels and to predict the impact of shocks, it is expedient to know who recently exchanged what with whom and for what purpose. The most appropriate format for presenting intersectoral linkages {{at the national level}} is in a National Accounting Matrix (NAM). A NAM is defined as the presentation of a sequence of <b>integrated</b> <b>accounts</b> and balancing items in a matrix that elaborates the linkages between a supply and use table and institutional sector accounts. This paper compiles the first pilot Euro Area Accounting Matrix (EAAM) and considers its usefulness for the euro area 2 ̆ 019 s economic analysis.

40|$|This chapter {{outlines}} {{the relationships between}} {{a number of key}} factors that influence learning and memory, and illustrates them by reference to studies on the foraging behaviour of fish. Learning can lead to significant improvements in foraging performance in only a few exposures, and at least some fish species are capable of adjusting their foraging strategy as patterns of patch profitability change. There is also evidence that the memory window for prey varies between fish species, and that this may be a function of environmental predictability. Convergence between behavioural ecology and comparative psychology offers promise in terms of developing more mechanistically realistic foraging models and explaining apparently 2 ̆ 7 suboptimal 2 ̆ 7 patterns of behaviour. Foraging decisions involve the interplay between several distinct systems of learning and memory, including those that relate to habitat, food patches, prey types, conspecifics and predators. Fish biologists, therefore, face an interesting challenge in developing <b>integrated</b> <b>accounts</b> of fish foraging that explain how cognitive sophistication can help individual animals to deal with the complexity of the ecological context...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} goals of agencies producing economic statistics is that those statistics be relevant and regularly used by public and private decision makers. Achieving this goal requires several elements including accuracy, timeliness, and sound concepts and methods. However, perhaps most important, in a world of constrained resources, it requires focusing on those statistics that are most important to decision makers in the public and private sector. And this may be the most difficult challenge. Statisticians are by nature perfectionists and most are data producers rather than data users. The result is a tendency to focus on a level of accuracy, conceptual consistency, or statistical integration that is too high relative the quality of the underlying source data or the needs of the users. A jewel-like set of <b>integrated</b> <b>accounts</b> that comes out so late as to be irrelevant to decision makers, or that is not benchmarked to comprehensive information, is of limited value. This short paper will discuss these and other issues important to developing and maintaining a set of economic statistics that are relevant to economic decision making. The focus will be on the U. S. experience and lessons that can be learned [...] positive and negative [...] from that experience. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} integrated macroeconomic {{accounts for}} the United States for the period 1985 to 2002 and discusses issues related to their construction and use. Specifically, it focuses on tying together the national income and product accounts (NIPAs) and international transaction accounts (ITA) published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the flow of funds accounts (FFA) published by the Federal Reserve Board. The paper provides <b>integrated</b> <b>accounts</b> for seven sectors: households and nonprofit organizations serving households, nonfinancial non-corporate businesses, nonfinancial corporate businesses, financial businesses, federal government, state and local governments, {{and the rest of}} the world. Each sector table has a full complement of accounts: current accounts (production and income accounts), accumulation accounts (capital account, financial account, and other changes in volume account), revaluation account, and balance sheet account. As a result, the sector statements trace the factors leading to changes in sector net worth. Relative to current publications of the two agencies, the tables go quite a bit further toward providing for the United States the sequence of accounts suggested in the System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA 93), the recognized international standard. The tables use official data as of June 10, 2004; however, a few series have been created by the authors, and they are unofficial preliminary estimates at this time. ...|$|E

40|$|The views {{expressed}} in this paper are solely those of the author and not necessarily those of the U. S. Bureau of Economic Analysis or the U. S. Department of Commerce. Also, special thanks to Susan McIntosh, Marco Cagetti and Elizabeth Holmquist of the Federal Reserve Board for their ongoing work on these accounts and their helpful comments. The integrated macroeconomic accounts (IMA), produced jointly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and the Federal Reserve Board (FRB), present a sequence of accounts that relate production, income and saving, capital formation, financial transactions, and asset revaluations to changes in net worth between balance sheets for major sectors of the U. S. economy. These <b>integrated</b> <b>accounts</b> are useful for analyzing sectoral developments in the U. S. economy, for both financial and nonfinancial assets. In this paper I will first provide some background information on the IMAs. Next, I’ll focus on the private sectors ’ nonfinancial assets, describing how the balance sheets positions (i. e. net stock), capital account flows, other changes in volume, and revaluation account estimates are prepared. I will also examine recent trends {{in some of the}} sectors and then conclude with a discussion on recent improvements and future plans for the IMAs...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of the annual I-O accounts with the GDP-by-industry accounts is the most recent {{in a series of}} improvements to the industry accounts provided by the BEA in recent years. BEA prepares two sets of national industry accounts: The I-O accounts, which consist of the benchmark I-O accounts and the annual I-O accounts, and the GDPby- industry accounts. Both the I-O accounts and the GDP-by-industry accounts present measures of gross output, intermediate inputs, and value added by industry. However, in the past, they were inconsistent because of the use of different methodologies, classification frameworks, and source data. The {{integration of}} these accounts eliminated these inconsistencies and improved the accuracy of both sets of accounts. The {{integration of the}} annual industry accounts represents a major advance in the timeliness, accuracy, and consistency of these accounts, and is a result of significant improvements in BEA's estimating methods. The paper describes the new methodology, and the future steps required to integrate the industry accounts with the NIPAs. The new methodology combines source data between the two industry accounts to improve accuracy; it prepares the newly <b>integrated</b> <b>accounts</b> within an I-O framework that balances and reconciles industry production with commodity usage. Moreover, the new methodology allows the acceleration of the release of the annual I-O accounts by 2 years and for the first time, provides a consistent time series of annual I-O accounts. Three appendices are provided: A description of the probability-based method to rank source data by quality; a description of the new balancing produced for producing the annual I-O accounts; and a description of the computation method used to estimate chaintype price and quantity indexes in the GDP-by-industry accounts. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{essence of}} the {{integrated}} reporting is described. Preconditions and problems when introducing the integrated reporting are presented. The information requests of integrated reporting users are described. The necessity of reflection {{of all types of}} capital, namely, natural, social, human and intellectual in the integrated reporting are revealed. The main advantages of compiling the <b>integrated</b> <b>accounts</b> for the enterprise are established: a broader perspective of consideration of the activity; the improvement of accounting policy as a result of integration of the principles of sustainable development into activity; increasing the trust of workers and consumers in the safety of technological processes and products for environment. For the wider introduction of the integrated reporting it is necessary to develop the methodological provision for accounting in accordance with the principles of sustainable development to ensure the reliability of the indices obtained; it is necessary to select the optimal list of indices that can meet the information needs of all users, in particular, investors, the state, auditors, society, creditors, consumers, employees, management personnel, academics, and the media. The main tasks and principles of compilation of the integrated reporting are presented. Orientation to the future, materiality, demand, integrity, reliability, completeness, periodicity, consistency, timeliness, interpretation, and comparability are suggested as the principles of integrated reporting. The issue of the necessity of conducting the external audit of the data verification of the integrity reporting is highlighted. The algorithm of profit distribution depending on the chosen strategy of enterprise development is proposed. When directing net profits for the development of production, the authors identify the following three strategies: insufficient upgrades, upgrades at the level of wear and the advanced renewal of non-current assets. It is proposed to choose the strategy for the extended renewal of non-current assets, which will increase the scope of activities and the net profit in the future. ...|$|E

40|$|To provide {{accounting}} information for management control purposes, two fundamental options exist: (a) The financial records {{can be used}} as a database for management <b>accounting</b> (<b>integrated</b> <b>accounting</b> system design), or (b) the management accounting system used by controllers can be based upon a so-called third set of books besides the financial and tax accounting records. Whereas the latter approach had been typical for firms in German-speaking countries until the 1980 s, since then an increasing number of them has been changing towards a (partially) <b>integrated</b> <b>accounting</b> system design. In accounting literature, a debate is still on whether this change is for the better or for the worse, especially as from a normative theory perspective no dominant standard exists that provides appropriate information for any given accounting problem which would support a separate accounting system design. Our paper adds to this debate by empirically analyzing the impact of an increasingly <b>integrated</b> <b>accounting</b> system design on controllership effectiveness. Our analysis is distinctive for two reasons. First, we use a dyadic research design surveying both controllers and representatives of general management which allows us to include managements perspective into our analysis in a valid fashion. Second, we do not restrict our model to the technical or supply-side characteristics of management accounting system design, but expand our approach to the user perspective of management {{accounting information}} as a financial language. By using structural equation modeling for a sample of 149 dyads surveyed from the German Top- 1500 firms in 2007, we identify no statistically significant direct effect of the technical accounting system design, but a fully mediating influence of a unified financial language on controllership effectiveness. Our results imply amongst others that consistency of management accounting with financial reporting, which results from an <b>integrated</b> <b>accounting</b> system design, is an important property of management accounting information. Especially in the context of a financially oriented management control system, controllers therefore should take special care to align their internal reporting with the financial accounting reports provided to investors...|$|R
