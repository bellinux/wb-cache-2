5|$|Crossing the Water {{is full of}} {{perfectly}} realised works. Its most striking <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> of a front-rank artist {{in the process of}} discovering her true power. Such is Plath's control that the book possesses a singularity and certainty which should make it as celebrated as The Colossus or Ariel.|$|E
5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, {{which is not the}} case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and have been described as resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|On the east, {{the first}} <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> all of rock. The long strath of Grisedale runs north-eastward to Ullswater, cutting off {{a series of}} hanging valleys which fall from the Helvellyn range. To the south east of Nethermost Pike, below the summit of High Crag, is Ruthwaite Cove. Surrounded by crag on three sides, this corrie {{contains}} Hard Tarn, a small pool on a rock shelf. This {{is one of the}} most difficult mountain tarns to locate, and its black algal bed and clear water combine to give the false impression of great depth. Ruthwaite Cove is now the site of Ruthwaite Lodge, a climbing hut. It was formerly the setting for more industrial activity, with the remains of several underground mines and some shallow open workings visible near the Lodge.|$|E
50|$|The {{very first}} <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> of poor quality {{and most of}} it had to be destroyed. Only a small {{quantity}} of this <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> released, in August 1873, and stamps of this <b>impression</b> <b>are</b> rare (2 kreuzer dark yellow).|$|R

25|$|Unlike other late self-portraits, in Self Portrait with Two Circles, Rembrandt, {{with one}} hand on his hip, appears confrontational and even defiant. The <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> that of a master solemnly asserting his genius.|$|E
5000|$|The {{book was}} {{originally}} published by Country Life in London. Second and third <b>impressions</b> <b>were</b> published in 1938 {{and a fourth}} <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> published in 1940. It was reprinted by Signal Books in 2001 (...) [...]|$|R
30|$|An <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> {{taken from}} each model, using {{condensation}} silicone (Zetaplus, Zhermack SpA, Italy). <b>Impressions</b> <b>were</b> boxed and poured with type IV dental stone (Elite® Stone, Zhermack GmbH Deutschland) {{in a vacuum}} device. The resulting three stone casts were used to fabricate the custom trays.|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of relined <b>impressions</b> <b>is</b> usually acceptable {{and in some}} cases is even more accurate than principal impression. Relined Polysulfide and condensational silicone <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> more accurate than polyether impressions. The reline method compared to retaking them is more economic and needs less chair time...|$|R
25|$|Since {{at least}} the 16th century {{there have also been}} pseudo-signet rings where the {{engraving}} is not reversed (mirror image), as it should be if the <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> to read correctly.|$|E
25|$|The carving is {{so perfect}} {{that the overall}} <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> that of {{openwork}} lace. The distinctiveness and richness of the church’s decoration evidence the artistic taste and consummate skill of the craftsmen who created it.|$|E
25|$|In psychology, a first <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> {{the event}} when one person first {{encounters}} another person and forms a mental image of that person. Impression accuracy {{varies depending on}} the observer and the target (person, object, scene, etc.) being observed.|$|E
50|$|The {{arms were}} short, with longer upper arms (humeri) than lower arms (ulna). The legs were long, {{and the upper}} leg (femur) was longer than the pelvic bones. The tail was {{relatively}} long and feather <b>impressions</b> <b>were</b> found near the tip. Additional feather <b>impressions</b> <b>were</b> identified along the neck.|$|R
50|$|Activity of wearer when <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> made: Plastic {{footwear}} impression left on soft surfaces {{can reveal}} {{whether a person}} was walking, running or carrying a heavy load when the <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> made. An <b>impression</b> made by person running will make <b>impressions</b> that <b>are</b> deeper in the heel and toe sections. A person carrying a heavy load such as a body will leave imprints that are deeper than when not carrying a heavy load.|$|R

25|$|Op art is {{a method}} of {{painting}} concerning the interaction between illusion and picture plane, between understanding and seeing. Op art works are abstract, {{with many of the}} better known pieces made in only black and white. When the viewer looks at them, the <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> given of movement, hidden images, flashing and vibration, patterns, or alternatively, of swelling or warping.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of surface variation {{as a means}} of illusionism--"kenlijkheyt", or perceptibility--was understood by some of Rembrandt's contemporaries. Even so, the dramatic differences between the paint application in the face and passages of the drapery and background are unusual for a late self-portrait. The overall <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> that of a complete work, one that presents the subject as marked by experience yet ultimately resolute in dignity.|$|E
25|$|The seal-making {{device is}} also {{referred}} to as the seal matrix or die; the imprint it creates as the seal impression (or, more rarely, the sealing). If the <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> made purely as a relief resulting from the greater pressure on the paper where the high parts of the matrix touch, the seal is known as a dry seal; in other cases ink or another liquid or liquefied medium is used, in another color than the paper.|$|E

30|$|Trackway XQ-S 1 {{consists}} of three successive pes tracks {{and appears to be}} narrow-gauge, with a (WAP/P’ML)-ratio of 0.9 (P’ML stands for the maximum length of pes, Table 2; Marty, 2008). No manus <b>impressions</b> <b>were</b> recognized. The average length of the pes <b>impressions</b> <b>is</b> 47.1  cm, and the average (length/width)-ratio is 1.4. The pes <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> oval and the metatarso−phalangeal region is smoothly curved. All tracks are poorly preserved without clear digit impression. The average pes pace angulation is 124 °, which is relatively high for sauropods. Trackway XQ-S 2 only preserves an incomplete single step and is morphologically similar to XQ-S 1.|$|R
50|$|An artist's {{impression}} or artist's {{interpretation is}} {{the representation of}} an object or a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot {{be seen by the}} naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract in other ways. For example, in architecture, artists' <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape. Artists' <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> particularly prominent in space art.|$|R
25|$|Although {{the dark}} {{passages}} of Kenton's figure are broadly painted and {{the contours of}} the suit blurred to suggest atmosphere, details like his head, watch chain and shoes are depicted with careful attention to their three-dimensional quality. This contrast of technique may have been intended to emphasize the solidly sculptural presence of the head. Furthering this <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> the delicate coloring of Kenton's face, seen against the hard edge of his starched white collar.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} are relatively soberly designed with few distinct details; the overall <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> monumental. The interior, however, has gradually been changed {{and very little}} remains from the original interior. An exception is the auditorium in the central courtyard, which keeps its original interior with ceiling paintings, as well as stage and balcony with classical decoration. This building along with the administration building are listed blue (class I) – as buildings of most historical importance. The remaining original {{buildings are}} listed green (class II) – important in a culture-historical perspective.|$|E
25|$|Self-efficacy is an individual's {{impression}} {{of their own}} ability to perform a demanding or challenging task such as facing an exam or undergoing surgery. This <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> based upon factors like the individual's prior success in the task or in related tasks, the individual's physiological state, and outside sources of persuasion. Self-efficacy {{is thought to be}} predictive of the amount of effort an individual will expend in initiating and maintaining a behavioural change, so although self-efficacy is not a behavioural change theory per se, it is an important element of many of the theories, including the health belief model, the theory of planned behaviour and the health action process approach.|$|E

40|$|This study aims at {{comparing}} {{the appearance of}} the finish line using the observational method, and a new method in taking the impression and displacement of the gingival tissue without the gingival cord. In this research, Twenty one (21) patients were chosen. Who did not suffer from any supportive tissue diseases (such as inflammation or gingival bleeding). The patients needed crowns for their molars. Three <b>impressions</b> <b>were</b> taken from each patient, and the total number of <b>impressions</b> <b>was</b> 63. After preparation, the first <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> handled with the traditional method (putty – wash) without the gingival retraction. The second <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> handled with the observational method. All the final <b>impressions</b> <b>were</b> filled by Acryl, either completely or only for the prepared tooth area. After that, the bases were filled with gypsum. Cochran and McNemar test were used to study the differences among the two groups’ averages. Results have shown that there are statistical differences {{between the first and second}} group. It was concluded that the Traditional Method is better than the other one. Although the observational method is good, the traditional one is much better...|$|R

25|$|The paste is kept covered {{after it}} has been used, in its {{original}} container (be it plastic or ceramic). It is kept in an environment away from direct sunlight and away from intense heat to prevent it from drying out. The paste for silk based pastes need to be stirred with a spatula every month or so to avoid the oil sinking down and drying out the paste as well as to prepare it for use. A good paste would produce a clear impression in one go; if the <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> not clear requiring further impressions then it indicates that the paste is either too dry or the cinnabar has been depleted.|$|E
25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass turned again to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E
25|$|Houghton Mifflin {{enlarged}} {{the book}} to 14.0 x 21.0cm commencing with the 15th printing, probably in 1964. At that point they abandoned importing sheets from George Allen and Unwin LTD. Parallel to the single British 15th printing, Houghton Mifflin reprinted The Hobbit nine times from their own plates until {{the advent of the}} third edition. They dropped the red color from the maps and removed the color frontispiece so that no color remained in the book's interior. The 15th and remaining printings of the second edition are bound in light green with lettering in dark blue. Beginning with the 18th impression the volumes state the printing number on the reverse of the title page, but the 15th, 16th, and 17th printings do not seem to have any unique marks to distinguish one from the other. The 23rd <b>impression</b> <b>is</b> the final impression of the second edition.|$|E

60|$|Thus {{our ideas}} of single complex <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> {{incomplete}} in one way, {{and those of}} numerous, more or less similar, complex <b>impressions</b> <b>are</b> incomplete in another way; that is to say, they are generic, not specific.

40|$|There is a {{very close}} {{relationship}} between the form {{and size of the}} anterior teeth and the patient's personality. In order to fulfill the patient's expectation to have his immediate complete denture with the same form and shape of his natural teeth, an <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> made before the teeth <b>were</b> extracted. This <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> poured with the same tooth colored self curing acrylic resin in the anterior teeth. After the resin set, the <b>impression</b> <b>was</b> fully poured with hard stone.
