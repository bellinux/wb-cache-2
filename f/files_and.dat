30|$|We created {{combined}} distance matrices for {{all possible}} combinations of distance matrices. In {{the case of}} the four input attributes considered in this paper, that means, we produced 11 combined matrices (sentences and DOM tags, sentences <b>and</b> <b>file</b> structures, sentences <b>and</b> images, DOM tags <b>and</b> <b>file</b> structures, DOM tags <b>and</b> images, <b>file</b> structure <b>and</b> images, sentences and DOM tags <b>and</b> <b>file</b> structure, sentences <b>and</b> DOM tags and images, sentences <b>and</b> <b>file</b> structures <b>and</b> images, DOM tags <b>and</b> <b>file</b> structures <b>and</b> images, and sentences and DOM tags <b>and</b> <b>file</b> structures <b>and</b> images).

5000|$|Due to {{encrypted}} {{tape drive}} solutions being a significant investment, smaller businesses, and especially [...] "startups", rely upon backup solutions that include cloud storage {{as well as}} writing files to removable disks.

5|$|A COBOL {{program is}} split into four divisions: the {{identification}} division, the environment division, the data division and the procedure division. The identification division specifies {{the name and}} type of the source element and is where classes and interfaces are specified. The environment division specifies any program features that depend on the system running it, such as <b>files</b> <b>and</b> character sets. The data division is used to declare variables and parameters. The procedure division contains the program's statements. Each division is sub-divided into sections, which {{are made up of}} paragraphs.|$|E
5|$|Chess {{strategy}} {{is concerned with}} evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term {{plans for the future}} play.

50|$|Though higher-end tape {{solutions}} {{have moved}} away from <b>file</b> <b>and</b> directory encryption to device-level encryption, the increase in cybercrime may be causing small to mid-size companies, {{as well as individual}} consumers, to increase the use of <b>file</b> <b>and</b> directory encryption.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, some {{manufacturers}} (notably Samsung) introduced SSD controllers that extended {{the concept of}} BGC to analyze the file system used on the SSD, to identify recently deleted <b>files</b> <b>and</b> unpartitioned space. Samsung claimed that this would ensure that even systems (operating systems and SATA controller hardware) which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance. The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume and require an NTFS file system. It is not clear if this feature is still available in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers. Systematic data corruption has been reported on these drives {{if they are not}} formatted properly using MBR and NTFS.|$|E

5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton {{completely}} detected {{most of the}} malware samples. For {{two-thirds of}} the samples, all traces were removed. Norton found and removed all the commercial keyloggers. A full scan took nearly an hour to complete though, {{twice as long as}} the 2007 version. The suite blocked most of the malware from installing and all the commercial keyloggers, regardless of any modifications made to the samples. PC World noted that Norton removed 80 percent of malware-associated <b>files</b> <b>and</b> Registry entries.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in Nature in January 2013, {{scientists from the}} European Bioinformatics Institute and Agilent Technologies proposed a mechanism to use DNA's ability to code information {{as a means of}} digital data storage. The group was able to encode 739 kilobytes of data into DNA code, synthesize the actual DNA, then sequence the DNA and decode the information back to its original form, with a reported 100% accuracy. The encoded information consisted of text <b>files</b> <b>and</b> audio files. A prior experiment was {{published in}} August 2012. It was conducted by researchers at Harvard University, where the text of a 54,000-word book was encoded in DNA.|$|E

5|$|The Microsoft Malware Protection Center {{identified}} a trend away from WSF files {{in favor of}} LNK <b>files</b> <b>and</b> PowerShell scripting. These LNK shortcut files install Locky ransomware by automating infection operations {{rather than relying on}} traditional user downloads of WSF files—all of which is made possible by the universal PowerShell Windows application. Unfortunately, cyber criminals have been able to leverage PowerShell for their attacks for years. In a recent report, the application was found to be involved in nearly 40% of endpoint security incidents. While attackers have been finding weaknesses in the Windows operating system for years, it’s clear that there’s something problematic with PowerShell scripting.|$|E
