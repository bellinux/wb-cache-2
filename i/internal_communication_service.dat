In this study of two case companies, participative business model development processes were designed to identify challenges and solutions in <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> management.

40|$|Municipal {{electric}} utilities (MEUs) are increasingly expanding into telecommunications services. Such entry is interesting in several respects. First, MEUs marry two potential pathways {{for the growth}} of telecommunications access infrastructure and services: public ownership of last-mile facilities and electric power company expansion into telecommunications. Second, municipalities are key early adopters of next generation access technology in the form of both fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) and broadband wireless (e. g., WiMax) systems. Third, MEUs are at the nexus of the debate over the proper role for local government in promoting broadband Internet access. Most homes in the United States are served by investor-owned local telephone and cable television providers, using company-owned wireline infrastructure. These providers have generally opposed municipal entry, arguing that it will crowd out private investment and represents an unfair and less efficient form of competition. A number of states have acted to limit [...] or in some cases [...] to promote such entry. Before engaging in this debate, it is necessary to have a clearer picture of the current state of municipal entry and the local demographic, cost, industry, and policy factors that influence its evolution. To address this need, this paper reports the results of an empirical analysis of MEUs that provide communications services to the public. This analysis shows that MEUs are more likely to offer such services if they also provide <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> <b>services</b> to support their electric utility operations (scope economies); are relatively close to metropolitan areas (lower backhaul costs); are in markets with fewer competitive alternatives (cable modem and DSL service availability limited); and which are less encumbered by regulatory barriers to entry (in communities in states which do not restrict municipal entry into telecommunication services). Of these results, the competitive impacts are the least straight-forward to interpret, suggesting richer dynamics and avenues for further research.

40|$|This article {{explores the}} nature of {{relationships}} between <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> modes, new <b>service</b> development (NSD) competencies (specifically learning and development competencies) and NSD performance. To do so, it draws on and advances communication theory by comparing and contrasting the contingent approach, favoured by media richness theory and media synchronicity theory, with the multiplicative manner of dual coding theory. Antecedent roles of rich and asynchronous communication modes for two NSD competencies are investigated, and their function as critical contingency variables affecting the competencies–performance link is unravelled. An empirical quantitative study of senior managers of leading service firms was conducted, with a survey-based methodology. Results show that a learning competency drives development competency which in turn drives NSD performance. Asynchronous communication is essential for learning competency but not for development competency. In contrast, rich communication underpins development but has no direct effect on learning competency. Rich communication is essential for NSD performance when a firm has a low development competency. The interaction between asynchronous and rich communication is shown to be positive for learning, whereas surprisingly it is negative for development competency...|$|R

The implementation of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> strategies can {{be a way to}} enhance company efficiency and it can also increase and support engagement of employees in everyday company operations and connect the employees expectations and increase their morale. On the other hand, inefficient communication is a stress factor paralysing the key functions in a company structure and its strategy.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{nature of}} the research question {{for this study was}} centred on the functions of <b>internal</b> <b>communication.</b> It was within this context that functionalism as theoretical approach was selected for the study of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> within the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) in South Africa. Functionalism’s interest in the structure and function of communication is evident in its major assumption, namely that the phenomenon of mass communication is a system that is a whole consisting of several interrelated and interdependent parts. In addition two related theories, systems theory and classical management theory, were employed as departure for the study. Related literature on <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> bears evidence that the flow of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> differs from one environment to the other. This depends on the type of information that has been communicated and the type of organisation in which the <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> occurs. Managing employees effectively requires communication and the quality of communication amongst the people that comprise an organisation is a crucial variable in determining organisational success. This requires a common understanding of the role and structure of communication and its functions. <b>Internal</b> <b>communication</b> is the strength of any organisation. Communication scholars such as Verwey and Du Plooy (2003), Kitchen and Daly (2002), Gibson and Hodgetts (1991), Murabe (1990) and numerous others already demonstrated the overwhelming importance of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in today’s business environment. <b>Internal</b> <b>communication</b> creates a platform for participative decision making, employees’ interaction, information sharing, creativity and innovation, as well as an environment that fosters productivity and creates a sense of organisational ownership. A comprehensive <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> system is required to unambiguously translate the vision, mission and strategic objectives of any organisation into reality. Furthermore effective <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> has a potential to build and sustain social interaction within the organisation and most importantly to drive a service delivery message to all employees. Effective <b>communication</b> and <b>service</b> delivery have recently become issue of exceptional importance in government departments in South Africa, particularly in government agencies. Factors such as organisational culture and leadership style have an influence on <b>internal</b> <b>communication.</b> Organisational culture defines and describes what the organisation stands for. Leadership is very critical for <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> as it informs the organisation’s vision. If the leadership is negatively inclined, there is no way in which the <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> will thrive. It is always advisable {{to strike a balance between}} organisational culture, leadership and <b>internal</b> <b>communication.</b> The findings of this study indicate that management and employees of the GCIS perceive the function of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> differently; that both management and employees have inadequate general understanding of the communication channels and communication structure within the GCIS and reveal that though there are numerous communication channels available, only few are used and preferred within the GCIS. The selection and the understanding of communication channels within the organisation are critical elements for <b>internal</b> <b>communication.</b> Therefore, the communication department or division should ensure broader consultation with all key stakeholders within the organisation. It is regrettable to have communication channels within the organisation that are not understood by the majority of employees and to discover that out of the twenty that are implemented, only five are mainly used and two preferred by most of the management and the employees.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore and {{describe}} Kenya Power employees’ perceptions of their adoption and implementation of online <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> tools as a means of creating and managing long lasting relationships among all employees in the organisation. The theoretical point of departure for this study was framed within online <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> and relationship management while principles of e-government were also considered. A single case study design was adopted for the study which combined both quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques while data was triangulated using an online self-administered questionnaire, focus group moderator’s guide and an interview schedule. The results guided by the theoretical criteria indicate that the implementation of online <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> tools was done at Kenya Power without considering the internal stakeholders’ needs and preferences. The consequence is that employees have developed negative perceptions about <b>internal</b> online <b>communication</b> resulting in low adoption for relationship management activities. The findings of this study could be useful for other public sector organisations in that it will help them to positively change employees’ perceptions as well as enhance the implementation and adoption of <b>internal</b> online <b>communication</b> tools for the purposes of relationship building which could result in better <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> and public sector <b>services.</b> <b>Communication</b> ScienceM.

40|$|Objectives of {{the study}} The {{objective}} {{of the study}} was to investigate the nature of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in a knowledge-intensive SME, as perceived by its employees. The case company {{of the study was}} a well-established Helsinki-based small and medium sized engineering company with highly specialised expertise in its field. The study explored how the company's <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> was organised in terms of channels, frequency, direction and content. The effect of the company size on the nature of its <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> was studied, as well as the main sources of satisfaction and challenges employees identified in <b>internal</b> <b>communication.</b> This was to answer the main research question: What is the nature of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in the case company? Methodology and theoretical framework The source of data in the qualitative single case study consisted of 18 semi-structured interviews conducted among employees at different hierarchy levels in the case company. The theoretical framework was based on breaking down <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> by stakeholder groups into four interrelated dimensions: <b>internal</b> line management <b>communication,</b> <b>internal</b> team peer <b>communication,</b> <b>internal</b> project peer <b>communication,</b> and <b>internal</b> corporate <b>communication.</b> Both formal and informal <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> were included in the model and their one-way or two-way direction was identified. The internal organisational environment with particular SME and knowledge-intensive characteristics formed the context for all four dimensions of <b>internal</b> <b>communication.</b> Findings and conclusions <b>Internal</b> <b>communication</b> in the case company was informal, unsystematic and unorganised by nature. These are all characteristic for SMEs, as their communication activities do not usually contain much strategic and planned perspectives and informal communication plays a more significant role compared to large organisations. <b>Internal</b> <b>communication</b> was two-way symmetrical on all dimensions, which is rare in the case of <b>internal</b> corporate <b>communication.</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>communication</b> had managed to engage employees with the company and thus retain its knowledge-workers.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to increase the understanding of internal communications and how employees perceive it in fast-changing organizations. An understanding of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> and its development was searched by concentrating in selected essential <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> areas in organizations, <b>internal</b> corporate <b>communication</b> function and <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> channels. The focus was on fast-changing organizations due to the fact that the development of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> does not usually go hand in hand with other organization development and business growth but tends to drag behind. The theoretical framework was formed of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in general, <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> development, <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in fast-changing organizations, <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in different organizational areas, internal corporate communicationas a function and <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> channels. The most valid <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> areas were selected to be management communication, team and supervisor communication and interdepartmental communication. The theoretical framework presented the dilemmas and characteristics that can occur among the issue of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> development. In order to achieve the determined objectives, a quantitative study was conducted. The survey named “Internal communications at the company x” with three different forms of questions was carried out in the case company. The topic was scrutinized from theperspective of a case company and aimed to find out employees’ perceptions. The web-based survey focused on the selected issues concerning <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> and its development. Questionnaires were sent out to the employees of the case company’s European organization and 94 responses were received. The collected data was analyzed against the theoretical framework, and with the help of analysis conclusions and managerial implications regarding this study were drawn. It was discovered that by developing these <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> areas together, fast-changing organizations succeed better in <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> and consequently in other operations. In fast-changing organizations, careful attention needs to be paid especially to the amount of management, supervisor and interdepartmental communication.

Development of interdepartmental communication processes is vital in order to improve knowledge sharing across the company and consequently business performance. It is essential that all members of work community understand their responsibility to communicate.

Gaps in theory have been emphasised in the literature and the area described as a 'wasteland in terms of research' (Argenti 1996, p. 94). The aim of the thesis was to rethink <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> to contribute theory with the potential to assist practice. Making a contribution to <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> theory in this way adds to the strategic public relations and corporate communications body ofknowledge, and may assist <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> management. This is important since <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> impacts employee engagement and organisational effectiveness. The conceptual analysis: positions <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> within integrated corporate communication; argues that <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> is multi-dimensional; introduces the <b>Internal</b> <b>Communication</b> Matrix to illustrate the dimensionality; and, contributes definitions of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> and <b>internal</b> corporate <b>communication.</b> Consequently, the thesis breaks an unhelpful continuous loop concerning definition of the field of <b>internal</b> <b>communication.</b> The empirical work used a research case study strategy involving focus groups and a questionnaire with open and closed questions to gather data from employees concerning their <b>internal</b> corporate <b>communication</b> preferences {{in the context of a}} UK university. The empirical analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data found an hierarchy ofmethod category preferences from most preferred: electronic, print, face-to-face. The hierarchy was inconsistent with previous literature claiming face-to-face communication as most preferred. An hierarchy ofpreference for <b>internal</b> corporate <b>communication</b> content category was found starting from most preferred: belonging, understanding, commitment, awareness. Further analysis found that employee group membership and knowledge worker group membership was associated with significantly different preferences for <b>internal</b> corporate <b>communication</b> content and methods.

The {{available}} {{literature on}} <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> generally identifies the organisation's internal stakeholders (employees) as one group {{or a single}} entity. This approach fails to acknowledge that in organisations, different internal stakeholders with different communication needs exist. As a result <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> programmes that were adopted tended to target the employees as one group thereby failing to address the specific communications needs of the various internal stakeholders.

Organizations {{are based on the}} <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> process, because without it, information, ideas could not be sent, the organization’s goals and values could not be built, and its organizational culture would simply not exist. The <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> process is centered on sending ideas, information in the organization. This is directly proportional with the efficiency of the organization. <b>Internal</b> <b>communication</b> allows for the best decision to be taken, for information to be sent towards the interior of the company, towards the employees, but also has the purpose of strengthening the relations between persons. <b>Internal</b> <b>communication</b> has at its basis the verbal and non-verbal communication, but they have great disadvantages, because: verbal communication has losses of information, depends on the moment of transmission, but also on the receiver.

While numerous studies present the importance of competitive rivalry and of <b>communication,</b> even <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> separately, {{little is known about the}} specific linkage of how competitive rivalry affects communication in the literature. Within the framework of <b>internal</b> <b>communication,</b> this study focuses on the notion that competitive rivalry is related to the path and style of communication as well as to the usage of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> tools but not to quality of communication. Thus, our research presents the linkage and the interaction between competitive rivalry and <b>internal</b> <b>communication,</b> of which the results indicate that, overall, competitive rivalry has a significant direct positive influence on <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> dimensions in terms of path, style and quality of communication, as well as usage of communication tools in healthcare organizations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction (Purpose) - The {{main purpose}} {{for this study}} is to study <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> {{challenges}} from a managerial and employee perspective in two interrelated IT departments. Furthermore this study aims to give suggestions for how organizations can improve their <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> within and between departments. Design/methodology/approach - The research setting took place in a Swedish telecom company where data was collected during 10 weeks. An abductive scientific approach was used with an extension of mixed methods with a triangulation design. Interviews and survey were made to both managers and employees as primary data, whereas different kinds of observations, informal interviews and meetings, intranet and employee satisfaction scores were used as secondary data. Findings - Findings show several <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> challenges, such as different definitions of what <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> stands for, too many media channels put strains on the <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> within and between IT departments which results in unsynchronization. The organizational structure itself creates <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> challenges as a result of not sharing common goals and strategies, but also responsibility issues which leads to misunderstanding and conflicts. To improve <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> challenges between the departments, some of the following examples were found; the need of overcoming unsynchronization, shared goals and strategies, common messages from head managers in order to reduce problems related to co-operation between the departments and desideration of an interactive communication tool. Practical implications – Deal with misunderstandings to prevent <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> challenges. Interrelated departments should strive for alignment through common goals and strategies. More interactive communication tools such as social networks could promote more effective <b>internal</b> <b>communication.</b> Originality/value – Rich data collection by using mixed methods resulted in empirical findings that address <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> challenges between two IT departments with an organizational structure that reminds of a line-and-staff organization from a managerial and employee perspective.   This thesis has been professionally proofread</p...|$|R

Not only do INGOs {{play a major role in}} aid delivery in developing countries, they also serve as the voice of the people in the growing global governance system. Thus they have an increasing impact on the social and economic welfare of people around the world. For this reason, the performance and management of INGOs is vital. However, research on their management is lacking. INGOs possess unique characteristics including complex environments, value-based missions and no financial bottom line. Therefore, management practices, like <b>internal</b> <b>communication,</b> that are generally developed for for-profit organisations need to be evaluated for suitability within the INGO context. Strategic <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> has been identified as driving organisational performance. <b>Internal</b> <b>communication</b> can be defined as strategic when its purpose is to align internal stakeholders with the organisation’s strategic intent. By facilitating strategic alignment, <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> can play a critical role in organisational performance. Research on strategic <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> is limited and virtually non-existent when considered within the INGO context. However, by considering communication management theory, strategic management theory and NGO management theory, it is possible to develop theoretical propositions on the strategic functioning of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in INGOs. In particular, the theory suggests that a postmodern approach to strategic management and strategic <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> can assist INGOs in addressing many of the challenges they face. This study explores the strategic functioning of <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in INGOs through exploratory, qualitative case studies. The evidence shows that <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in INGOs does not generally function strategically. However, the function is recognised as having potential to improve the performance of these organisations. In particular, there is support for the suitability of a postmodern approach to strategic <b>internal</b> <b>communication</b> in INGOs. Dissertation (MPhil) [...] University of Pretoria, 2011.
