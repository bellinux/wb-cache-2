A <b>double</b> layer silk <b>cloth</b> {{approximately}} 30 cm or {{a little}} less than 12 inches square, with fold on one edge and the other three edges sewn together so the stitching is invisible. It is used for the symbolic cleansing of the tea scoop and tea caddy, and (usually by women) to handle hot kettle or pot lids. The host and assistants at a tea gathering wear the fukusa tucked into the obi. By tradition, the host of a formal tea ceremony uses a new, previously unused fukusa. Fukusa are most often monochromatic and unpatterned, but variations exist. There are different colours for men (usually purple) and women (orange or red), for people of different ages or skill levels, for different ceremonies and for different schools. The size and way of making fukusa was purportedly established by Sen Sōon, Sen Rikyū's second wife.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the nutrient composition and sensory properties of fruit juice produced from fruits of Pitanga cherry (Eugenia uniflora L.). Ripe Pitanga cherry fruits were harvested from the premises of the National Root Crops Research Institute, Umudike, Nigeria and used for the study. The fruits were sorted and washed thoroughly. The seeds were removed manually and the pulp was blended in a high speed Kenwood kitchen blender with little water (pulp: water; 4 : 1) for 10 minutes. The mixture was screened through a clean <b>double</b> folded cheese <b>cloth</b> into a beaker. The fruit juice was boiled in hot water for 15 minutes and poured into sterilized bottles for nutrient composition and sensory evaluation.

40|$|Abstract- Phaseolus vulgaris is an {{economically}} important crop. The most important disease which hampers its production is anthracnose which {{is found in}} almost every bean growing region of the world. Anthracnose in beans {{is caused by a}} hemibiotrophic fungus, namely Colletotrichum lindemuthianum. Use of resistant genotypes will provide a long lasting solution to the economic losses caused by anthracnose as this method is biologically safe as well as cost effective. For the present investigation, nearly ten C. lindemuthianum isolates collected from Baramulla, Kashmir were used. Inoculum of each isolate was produced by inoculating bean extract medium with a monosporic culture of C. lindemuthianum, incubated at 25 ºC for seven days, the spore suspension culture filtered through <b>double</b> layered muslin <b>cloth</b> and inoculum load was adjusted to 1. 2 X 10 6 spores per milliliter {{with the help of a}} haemocytometer. Seed dip method was used for the inoculation of the test plant. The inoculated seeds were sown in sand and were kept at 25 ºC for the period of one month. The disease reaction was scored after twelve days of inoculation following 0 - 5 scale where 0 = no disease; 1 = pin point lesion; 2 = small lesion; 4 = large deep lesion and 5 = sunken lesions with rotten apex. Two broad categories of the accessions emerged; infected (infection rate high or mild) or non-infected. Based on the presence or absence of infected plants accessions were labeled as susceptible or resistant. I...|$|R
60|$|After {{three or}} four months of the {{scorching}} hot weather had gone by, my friend Strickland, of the Police, saw fit to rent the bungalow from the native landlord. This was before he was engaged to Miss Youghal--an affair which has been described in another place--and while he was pursuing his investigations into native life. His own life was sufficiently peculiar, and men complained of his manners and customs. There was always food in his house, but there were no regular times for meals. He ate, standing up and walking about, whatever he might find at the sideboard, and this is not good for human beings. His domestic equipment was limited to six rifles, three shot-guns, five saddles, and a collection of stiff-jointed mahseer-rods, bigger and stronger than the largest salmon-rods. These occupied one-half of his bungalow, and the other half was given up to Strickland and his dog Tietjens--an enormous Rampur slut who devoured daily the rations of two men. She spoke to Strickland in a language of her own; and whenever, walking abroad, she saw things calculated to destroy the peace of Her Majesty the Queen- Empress, she returned to her master and laid information. Strickland would take steps at once, and the end of his labours was trouble and fine and imprisonment for other people. The natives believed that Tietjens was a familiar spirit, and treated her with the great reverence that is born of hate and fear. One room in the bungalow was set apart for her special use. She owned a bedstead, a blanket, and a drinking- trough, and if any one came into Strickland's room at night her custom was to knock down the invader and give tongue till some one came with a light. Strickland owed his life to her, {{when he was on the}} Frontier, in search of a local murderer, who came in the gray dawn to send Strickland much farther than the Andaman Islands. Tietjens caught the man as he was crawling into Strickland's tent with a dagger between his teeth; and after his record of iniquity was established in the eyes of the law he was hanged. From that date Tietjens wore a collar of rough silver, and employed a monogram on her night-blanket; and the blanket was of <b>double</b> woven Kashmir <b>cloth,</b> for she was a delicate dog.|$|R

50|$|Grödinge {{tapestry}} (Grödingebonaden) is a handwoven tapestry that is {{on display}} at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm, Sweden. It originates from Grödinge church in Södermanland. The tapestry is made in a weaving technique called <b>double</b> <b>cloth</b> (finnväv), and it has a symmetrical square pattern in blue and white with lions, birds and eagles or falcons, as well as dragons along the lower edge. All animals are depicted in profile and in the same direction. The dragons along {{the lower part of the}} tapestry are linked to each other with their long tails. The patterns on Grödingebonaden have been associated to patterns from Byzantium, with clear traces of Scandinavian influences. Grödingebonaden consists of two lengths, of which one has remaining edges which shows the weave width to be about 85 cm. The original length for both the tapestries is unknown. The tapestry is made of wool. It has been difficult to date, but it is believed to be manufactured in the 1400s. It stands out for great technical finesse and clear composition, representing the transition between the early medieval textiles made in <b>double</b> <b>cloth</b> (finnväv) and the later ones with strong renaissance elements. A simpler version from Sankt Mårten is in the National Museum of Finland in Helsinki. Other tapestries of the same kind, have been found in Södra Råda and Överenhörna in Sweden, and in Raumo in Finland. The tapestry was donated to the Swedish History Museum in 1910.|$|E

5000|$|Vráka (βράκα) are the {{traditional}} breeches {{of the islands}} of Greece from the westernmost Ionian Islands to the easternmost, Cyprus. Greek breeches are extremely roomy and {{are meant to be}} tucked inside long boots just below the knee. They were originally meant to facilitate movement on fishing boats and sailing ships. They are usually accompanied by a long, wide piece of cloth turned many times around the natural waist as a belt. As the vráka lacks pockets, items (such as money) were stored inside the folds of this belt. Vrákas are usually made of sturdy cotton <b>double</b> <b>cloth,</b> usually dark blue or black, with brighter color cloth used as the belt. They were usually worn with white, long-sleeved shirts and a roomy waistcoat.|$|E
5000|$|She {{moved to}} Bradford, England, {{arriving}} in 1932 and undertaking a year's study at Bradford Technical College. One reason for choosing this location was that Swiss technical colleges {{would not accept}} women students - and at Bradford she was only the third female student. In an interview in 1990, Straub noted that Germany during the early 1930s {{was out of the}} question as she was known for being outspoken and her mother did not want to have to rescue her from prison. [...] The Bradford course covered textile maths, weaving technology and raw materials, as well as cloth construction, and its focus was on woollen materials as the city was a major wool manufacturing centre. The experience gave Straub a keen interest in the uses and varieties of fibres and she developed her skills in <b>double</b> <b>cloth</b> textile construction and the use of power looms.|$|E
50|$|In 1916 {{she visited}} Eric Gill and The Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic in Ditchling. Mairet was so {{impressed}} that she set about moving to the same community. In 1918 she published A Book on Vegetable Dyes. During the 1930s and 1940s she trained people in weaving and dyeing at her Gospels studio at Ditchling. Mairet's seminal training at her workshop {{is said to have}} influenced all of the aspiring hand weavers of that generation. The Swiss weaver Marianne Straub came to work with her and to learn more about hand loom weaving and Mairet taught Straub about hand dyeing and spinning. Straub introduced a variety of <b>double</b> <b>cloth</b> weaves and developed a friendship with Mairet. Mairet learnt from Straub and this underwrote her belief that hand loom weaving could be used by industry. Straub and Mairet went on three European holidays during the mid 1930s and Straub would frequently return to Mairet and Gospels. A surviving journal written by Mairet from a European journey with her husband in 1927 illustrates how her observations were dominated not by whom she met but what they were wearing.|$|E
