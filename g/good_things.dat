5|$|Yagan's skull {{was handed}} over to the Noongar {{delegation}} at a ceremony at Liverpool Town Hall on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, earlier that day: That is how nature goes... Nature is a carrier of all <b>good</b> <b>things</b> and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months later, the Gardiners take Elizabeth {{on a trip to}} the Peak District; their visit also {{includes}} Darcy's estate, Pemberley; Elizabeth agrees to go with them, believing that he is away travelling. Elizabeth is stunned by its wealth and beauty, and hears nothing but <b>good</b> <b>things</b> about Darcy from his housekeeper. There, she accidentally runs into Darcy, who has arrived home early. He invites her and the Gardiners to meet his sister. His manners have softened considerably, and Georgiana takes an instant liking to Elizabeth. When Elizabeth learns that her immature and flirtatious youngest sister Lydia has run away with Wickham, she tearfully blurts out the news to Darcy and the Gardiners before returning home. Her family expects social ruin for having a disgraced daughter, but over a week later they are relieved to hear that Mr. Gardiner had discovered the pair in London and that they had married. Lydia later slips to Elizabeth that Darcy was the one who found them and paid for the marriage.|$|E
50|$|In 1938, the {{government}} fined Rutter Brothers Dairy for {{having too much}} butterfat in its milk. What initially seemed like a setback turned into a very <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for a fledgling dairy as the public learned that Rutter’s had been cited for having {{too much of a}} <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And a very <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> too,--a very <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> indeed. But {{why were}} you asleep in the wood? It isn't warm, you know. I call it rather cold." [...] And the earl stopped, and looked at him, scrutinising him, as though {{resolved}} to inquire into so deep a mystery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if {{you feel}} that way, Tom, why don't you break away and go? I think, perhaps, it would be not only a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for Dick, but it would, also, be a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for you," [...] and, for the moment, Sam looked very seriously at his brother.|$|R
5|$|Sol is Asher's younger brother, and Asher has {{provided}} for him {{most of his}} life. Asher has been a father figure to Sol since a young age, and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. Sol is loyal to his brother, but depends on him {{so much that he}} finds it difficult to function without him. Sol likes his family to be together, but they are fractured due to Asher being a troublemaker and their mother being mentally unstable and Sol wants to reunite them. Sol's dependence on Asher also means he finds it difficult to establish his own identity. Asher is willing to put himself out to secure Sol's success, such as being stabbed by his mother and giving away his father's Rolex watch so Sol can get a place in the dance group, and has done things so that Sol would not have to do them himself. Thompson opined that Asher is not necessarily the best role model for Sol, but is a good brother even though the mistakes he makes override the <b>good</b> <b>things</b> he has done for Sol. Cole said that Sol is not a troublemaker but he gets into trouble without meaning to as trouble comes to him. Although he does not bring attention to himself, he has a bad temper and hides his feelings with violence. He gets into a few fights throughout the series, and makes situations worse by getting physical. Sol does not understand or think about what he is doing when he loses his temper. Cole also said that trust is an issue with Sol throughout the series.|$|E

25|$|Meno {{proposes that}} virtue {{is the desire}} for <b>good</b> <b>things</b> {{and the power to}} get them. Socrates points out that this raises a second problem—many people do not {{recognize}} evil. The discussion then turns to the question of accounting for {{the fact that so many}} people are mistaken about good and evil and take one for the other. Socrates asks Meno to consider whether <b>good</b> <b>things</b> must be acquired virtuously in order to be really good. Socrates leads onto the question of whether virtue is one thing or many.|$|E
60|$|Another {{idea arose}} {{in the minds of}} the wisest British statesmen. If {{prohibitive}} warfare were a <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for America, it would be an equally <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> for England. More than that, it would be a better thing if only these two countries possessed the power of waging prohibitive warfare.|$|R
