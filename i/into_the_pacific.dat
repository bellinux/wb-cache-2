5|$|At 0000UTC on September20, the {{depression}} made landfall near Punta Cabezas, Nicaragua with winds of 35mph (55km/h) and weakening was immediately forecast. Three hours later, the National Hurricane Center issued its final advisory, as {{the lower level}} center became poorly defined because of interaction with the mountains of Central America and deep thunderstorm activity had significantly diminished. The National Hurricane Center noted the possibility of regeneration, if the circulation entered <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean within a few days. Although {{the depression}} never redeveloped, the remnant tropical wave emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean {{and contributed to the}} development of Hurricane Juliette on September21.|$|E

5|$|A {{segment of}} what is now SR11 was {{originally}} added to the state highway system in 1895 as a Blanchard Whatcom County line road. The highway became State Road6 in 1905 and was named Waterfront Road in 1907. The road was incorporated <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Highway in 1913 and U.S. Route99 (US99) in 1926. After an inland bypass was designated by the state to become US99 in 1931, Chuckanut Drive became U.S. Route99 Alternate. During the 1964 highway renumbering, the road became SR11. In 1987, SR11 was realigned through Bellingham, shifting its northern terminus south to Fairhaven.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean from Central America on September 10. Convection {{along the}} wave became better organized {{as it moved}} westward, and a tropical depression developed on September 18. The depression moved generally west-northwestward before strengthening into Tropical Storm Marty on September 19. The storm entrained dry air into its circulation as it curved toward the northwest, disrupting the storm's convective structure and inhibiting further intensification {{for the next two}} days. Eventually, Marty fought off the dry air and intensified, reaching hurricane strength on September 21.|$|E
5|$|Across North America during La Niña, {{increased}} precipitation is diverted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Northwest {{due to a}} more northerly {{storm track}} and jet stream. The storm track shifts far enough northward to bring wetter than normal conditions (in the form of increased snowfall) to the Midwestern states, as well as hot and dry summers. Snowfall is above normal across the Pacific Northwest and western Great Lakes. Across the North Atlantic, the jet stream is stronger than normal, which directs stronger systems with increased precipitation towards Europe.|$|E
5|$|As Carlos moved inland, {{it turned}} to the {{northwest}} {{in response to the}} anticyclone over Mexico, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status. By 12hours after landfall, there was little evidence of a circulation on satellite imagery. Late on June27, Carlos degenerated into a non-convective remnant low pressure area near Acapulco. The circulation {{turned to the}} southwest and emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean; by 0000UTC on June29, the system dissipated completely.|$|E

5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War in 1989, the US {{government}} conducted careful {{restructuring of}} national priorities and of the defense establishment. Fort Lewis, ideally located to act as a base for mobilization and power projection <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> region, was one of few military bases that did not downsize with the US military overall. Thus, while most of the Army was downsizing, Fort Lewis began to grow, however, several tenant units such as the 9th Infantry Division were downsized.|$|E
5|$|On August 25, Tropical Storm Chloe made {{landfall}} on British Honduras (present day Belize) as {{a tropical}} depression. After dissipating, {{the remnants of}} the storm crossed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean, where they contributed to an area of shower activity that persisted over the Gulf of Tehuantepec. On August 28, the tropical activity organized around a circulation which quickly developed into a tropical depression the same day. The depression was upgraded to a tropical storm on August 29 based on satellite presentation that depicted significant cirrus outflow and a commashaped cloud mass spanning 2° of latitude in diameter and was subsequently named Lily.|$|E

The most notable of these ranges is the Maclennan Range. Between them, these hills are often simply referred to as the Catlins Ranges. Their northwestern slopes are drained by several tributaries of the Clutha and Mataura Rivers, most notably the Mokoreta River, which flows mainly westwards, reaching the Mataura close to the town of Wyndham.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} Hurricane Tico {{were from a}} weak {{tropical}} disturbance that crossed Costa Rica <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean on October7. It tracked westward through an area of progressively warmer water temperatures, and by October11 the system was sufficiently organized to be declared Tropical Depression Twenty-One, about 575mi (930km) south of the Mexican port of Acapulco. The depression initially maintained a west-northwest motion, although on October12 it turned sharply northward, due {{to the influence of}} a strong trough moving eastward through Mexico. Gradually organizing, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Tico on October13 by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center (EPHC).|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Irene {{gradually}} intensified as {{it continued}} across the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Late on September18, the storm attained hurricane status {{a short distance}} {{off the coast of}} Central America, with 80mph (130km/h) winds, its peak intensity in the Atlantic Ocean. As it strengthened, it developed an eye and spiral rainbands that extended across Panama <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean. Hurricane Irene weakened slightly as it approached the coast, although its pressure dropped to 989mbar. On September19, the hurricane made landfall in the Nicaraguan South Caribbean Coast Autonomous Region; it was the first tropical cyclone of hurricane intensity since 1911 to strike Nicaragua south of Bluefields. Irene quickly weakened, deteriorating to tropical depression status within 18hours of moving ashore. The circulation remained organized over the low-lying terrain of southern Nicaragua, possibly due to it crossing Lake Nicaragua. After reaching the Pacific Ocean on September20, the depression restrengthened to attain tropical storm status; upon doing so, it was re-designated by a new name, Olivia. It was the first time an Atlantic hurricane was tracked as a tropical cyclone while crossing Central America <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific</b> Ocean; subsequent research indicated there were earlier storms that accomplished the feat, although they were not known at the time.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa on September10. Tracking westward, the wave split into two portions, with the slower-moving northern portion ultimately developing into Atlantic Tropical Depression Nine on September16. The southern portion crossed Venezuela and Colombia and emerged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pacific,</b> where a large area of deep convection began to form. A well-defined low pressure area developed on September26, and organized into a tropical depression by 18:00UTC (1p.m.CDT) the same day while situated about 335mi (540km) southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero. Six hours later, after banding features became more defined and intensity estimates using the Dvorak technique showed a slight increase in intensity, the depression was classified as a tropical storm and was accordingly named Marty by the National Hurricane Center (NHC). At the time, the storm was moving slowly northward due to the influence of a large mid- to upper-level trough.|$|E
