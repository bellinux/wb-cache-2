However, the singular word [...] "detail" [...] has evolved to mean other terms in some cultures, such as a military security detail as a duty assignment, or detailing a car as cleaning or polishing a vehicle ("to detail"), and so the plural form, [...] "details" [...] has been used to more clearly indicate the finer points of a topic.|$|E

Several reviewers have commented that the movie has a hyper-stylized Kubrickian tone, reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange. The [...] "Kubrick-esque" [...] style includes Isaacs' [...] "gleeful sadism... at times darkly comedic," [...] a whistling villain reminiscent of Alex DeLarge.

50|$|Blueprint for a Red Generation Written in 1952, at {{the height}} of the Cold War, this {{critique}} draws back the iron curtain from the author’s native post-war Hungary for an in-depth critique of the educational methods and goals of the Soviet socialist system as applied in Hungary. As a clear antithesis to the deceptive propaganda behind the Iron Curtain, the author presents a well-researched, fact based analysis which recognizes that the Soviet engineered education reforms were very successful at achieving their goals. These achievements are cited with specific data and include historically high enrollment and graduation rates and almost complete elimination of illiteracy. The author reminds us that the stated goal of this is to serve the State in building its new Industrial utopia with ever increasing production efficiency. As argued by Juhasz, these goals come at the expense of human freedom, breakdown of the family, suppression of national identity, and elimination of religious practice. Not only are the goals anathema to the author’s view of humanity and culture, but the methods to achieve them are a testament to their malevolence including the omnipresence of political commissars (thought police), and the brutal attacks on those who showed less than total enthusiasm for the new order. “The narrow specialization, the complete ideological control, the autocratic domination, the Russification, the cultural, technological, and historical distortions to match Russian patterns … The constant anti-democratic propaganda and above all the iron curtain against free expression and exclusion of all true Western knowledge and history…” The <b>devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> and the author cites numerous examples of the tyranny that the Hungarian people were subjected to in their education system at this time.|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, {{following}} the reconfiguration of the state's legislative districts and following Saunders's decision {{to run for}} the Florida Senate rather than seek re-election, an open seat occurred in the reformatted 120th District. Raschein opted {{to run for the}} seat, and faced former Key West Mayor Morgan McPherson, the 2010 nominee, in the Republican primary. She was able to defeat McPherson comfortably, winning 66% of the vote to his 34%, and advanced to the general election, where she faced Ian Whitney, the Democratic nominee. Over the course of the campaign, the two candidates staked out positions in opposition to each other. Raschein supported private school vouchers while Whitney did not; Whitney supported the expansion of Medicaid under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act while Raschein opposed it, noting, [...] "I am all for health care. But I don't know how the states {{are going to be able}} to pay for the expansion of Medicaid. The <b>devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>details.</b> How are we going to pay for that? We don't want to cut education anymore, social services can't be cut anymore. I am concerned about how we are going to fund it." [...] Despite the competitive nature of the election, Raschein and Whitney maintained mutual respect and kindness for each other, with Whitney noting that the two of them got along [...] "very well" [...] and Raschein calling her opponent [...] "a very nice guy." [...] Ultimately, Raschein narrowly defeated Whitney, winning her first term with 52% of the vote to his 48%. In doing so Raschein followed in the footsteps of her great-grandfather Hartley Hendrick Hethcox, who served in the Florida House of Representatives in the 1940s and was a County Commissioner in Lake County.|$|E

The unprecedented bimetallic 2 D coordination polymer {Fe[(Hg(SCN) 3) 2](4, 4 ’-bipy) 2 }n {{exhibits a}} thermal high-spin (HS) $low-spin (LS) staircase-like conversion characterized by a multi-step dependence of the HS molar fraction gHS. Between the fully HS (gHS= 1) and LS (gHS= 0) phases, two steps associated with different ordering appear in terms of spin-state concentration waves (SSCW). On the gHS= 0. 5 step, a periodic SSCW forms with a HS-LS-HS-LS sequence. On the gHS= 0. 34 step, the 4 D superspace crystallography structural refinement reveals an aperiodic SSCW, with a HS-LS sequence incommensurate with the molecular lattice.

50|$|Caesar himself abstains {{from using}} the moment to make pretentious or even vicious demands, but the oration will surely have angered many of the Roman nobility, because—as so often with Caesar—the <b>devil</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> details: On the surface he seems to respect the {{division}} of kings and gods {{as well as the}} difference between the human and the divine sphere. But he clearly refers to Ancus Marcius, an ancient Roman king, who was said to have revived and completed the religious institutions of Numa after succeeding Tullus Hostilius. Caesar skillfully harmonizes the two complexes by emphasizing the sanctitas of the kings, making them a vis-à-vis of the gods with their caerimonia. Furthermore, Caesar functions not only as an orator but as the terminus of the two gentilician branches, introducing the attributes not only as family matters but as something that Caesar is entitled to by birthright. This incorporation of monarchic and divine attributes is therefore seen as an early proclamation of Caesar's aspiration for political and religious power in Rome.|$|R
