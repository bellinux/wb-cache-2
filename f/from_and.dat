5|$|Aeronautical {{engineering}} {{firms were}} quick {{to respond to the}} Comet's commercial advantages and technical flaws alike; other aircraft manufacturers learned <b>from,</b> <b>and</b> profited by, the hard-earned lessons embodied by de Havilland's Comet. While the Comet's buried engines were used on some other early jet airliners, such as the Tupolev Tu-104, later aircraft, such as the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8, would differ by employing podded engines held on pylons beneath the wings. Boeing stated that podded engines were selected for their passenger airliners because buried engines carried a higher risk of catastrophic wing failure in the event of engine fire. In response to the Comet tragedies, manufacturers also developed various means of pressurisation testing, often {{going so far as to}} explore rapid depressurisation; subsequent fuselage skins were of a greater thickness than the skin of the Comet.|$|E
5|$|After {{starting}} at left offensive tackle from 1970 to 1972, and missing only one game in that span, Key {{was moved to}} left guard for the 1973 season. He played in 12 games in 1973, missing two due to injury, and all 14 games in 1974, despite suffering hand and thumb injuries {{in a game against}} the Washington Redskins. During the 1975 season, he suffered a knee injury during mini-camp in May that required surgery, a dislocated toe in {{the first game of the}} season against the New York Giants that was thought to take at least six weeks to recover <b>from,</b> <b>and</b> a fractured forearm in practice on October 16 that also required surgery. He was placed on injured reserve due to the broken arm on October 17 after playing in only two games during the season. From 1976 to 1978, he played in 40 games and started in 39 of them.|$|E

A machine the protagonist calls a fiddler crab, due to its design, is guarding the entrance to the city in which he came <b>from,</b> <b>and</b> he devises a plan to destroy it armed with only a grenade launcher.

5|$|Al-Azhar {{soon became}} a center of {{learning}} in the Islamic world, and official pronouncements and court sessions were issued <b>from</b> <b>and</b> convened there. Under Fatimid rule, the previously secretive teachings of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab (school of law) were {{made available to the}} general public. Al-Nu‘man ibn Muhammad was appointed qadi (judge) under al-Mu’izz and placed in charge of the teaching of the Ismāʿīli madh'hab. Classes were taught at the palace of the Caliph, as well as at al-Azhar, with separate sessions available to women. During Eid ul-Fitr in 973, the mosque was rededicated by the caliph as the official congregational mosque in Cairo. Al-Mu’izz, and his son—when he in turn became caliph—would preach at least one Friday khutbah (sermon) during Ramadan at al-Azhar.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from their}} {{function}} in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen <b>from,</b> <b>and</b> carbon dioxide to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral {{surface of the}} disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E

5|$|Bicycles and {{motorcycles}} {{are both}} single-track vehicles and so their motions have many fundamental attributes in common and are fundamentally different <b>from</b> <b>and</b> {{more difficult to}} study than other wheeled vehicles such as dicycles, tricycles, and quadracycles. As with unicycles, bikes lack lateral stability when stationary, and under most circumstances can only remain upright when moving forward. Experimentation and mathematical analysis have shown that a bike stays upright when it is steered to keep its center of mass over its wheels. This steering is usually supplied by a rider, or in certain circumstances, by the bike itself. Several factors, including geometry, mass distribution, and gyroscopic effect all contribute in varying degrees to this self-stability, but long-standing hypotheses and claims that any single effect, such as gyroscopic or trail, is solely responsible for the stabilizing force have been discredited.|$|E

5|$|Complex taboos and rites are {{associated}} with a woman's first childbirth. When about to give birth she is secluded in a special birthing house called a komby. The leaves she eats <b>from</b> <b>and</b> the waste produced by the newborn are kept in a special receptacle for seven days, at which point they are burned. The ash produced is rubbed on the forehead and cheeks of the mother and baby and must be worn for seven days. On the fifteenth day both are bathed in water in which lime or lemon leaves have been soaked. This ritual is called ranom-boahangy (bath of the leaves). The community gathers to drink rum and celebrate with wrestling matches, but the mother must stay in the komby. She is not allowed to consume anything other than saonjo greens and a chicken specially prepared for her. After this celebration she is required to leave the komby and can return to routine life.|$|E

A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E

5|$|Dualism and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. Dualism is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge <b>from</b> <b>and</b> cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|Each clan has a {{specified}} area {{of land that}} all members contribute to foraging <b>from</b> <b>and</b> defending.
