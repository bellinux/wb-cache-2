The California Gold Rush of 1849 brought rapid growth, making it the largest city on the West Coast at the time. San Francisco became a consolidated city-county in 1856.|$|E
5|$|Glendale, just a <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Downtown Los Angeles, has a {{population}} of about 200,000, of which, according to some estimates, 40% is Armenian. According to the 2000 Census 53,840 people or 27% of the population identified themselves Armenian in Glendale. Glendale also home to the highest percentage of people born in Armenia. Other than Glendale and Los Angeles proper, significant Armenian populations reside in Burbank (8,312), Pasadena (4,400), Montebello (2,736), Altadena (2,134), La Crescenta-Montrose (1,382). The Armenian Genocide Martyrs Monument, the oldest and largest Armenian Genocide memorial in the US, is located in Montebello.|$|E

The Meccans retired for the evening {{at a place called}} Hamra al-Asad, a <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Medina. The next morning, Muhammad sent out a small force to harass the Meccan army on their way home. According to Watt, this was because Muhammad realized that a show of force was required to speed the Meccans away from Medinan territory. The Meccans, not wanting to be perceived as being chased away, remained nearby for a few days before leaving.|$|E
5|$|Sir Bobby Robson {{was raised}} a <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Tow Law, {{in the village}} of Langley Park.

On 1 August 2009, the club held a minute's silence before their game with Workington, following his death the day before.|$|E
5|$|The Crosby Garrett Helmet is {{a copper}} alloy Roman cavalry helmet {{dating from the}} late 2nd or early 3rd century AD. It was found by an unnamed metal detectorist near Crosby Garrett in Cumbria, England, in May 2010. Later {{investigations}} found that a Romano-British farming settlement had occupied {{the site where the}} helmet was discovered, which was located a <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from a Roman road and a Roman army fort. It is possible that the owner of the helmet was a local inhabitant who had served with the Roman cavalry.|$|E

50|$|Due {{largely in}} part to its age and {{location}} on the fault line and consequently {{as a result of}} the dilapidated buildings and approval by the tax payers, a new Woodlawn High School was constructed a <b>few</b> short <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> on a 57 acre site. The new school opened its doors in 2003 and became the first new school to open in the parish in 30 years. As a result of the construction of a new school, the site of the original school was razed in 2004. The former location, although moved on the property, is now home to Woodlawn Middle School.|$|R

5|$|The nomadic Karankawa Indians {{used the}} bay for hunting {{before the arrival}} of Europeans, but no major human {{settlements}} were ever established. The unincorporated community of Lamar on Live Oak Peninsula is the only substantial community that borders the bay. The cities of Rockport and Fulton on the main Aransas Bay are located only a <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> and the bay is usually considered a part of the collective Rockport-Fulton area. The bay is roughly 150 miles southeast of San Antonio and about 40 miles northeast of Corpus Christi.|$|E
5|$|The assault at Zeebrugge a <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Ostend {{was more}} {{successful}} and the blocking {{of the major}} channel did cause some consternation amongst the German forces in Bruges. The larger raiders could no longer leave the port, but smaller ships, including most submarines, were still able to traverse via Ostend. In addition, within hours a narrow channel had also been carved through Zeebrugge too, although British intelligence did not realise this for several weeks. The defeat at Ostend did not entirely dampen the exuberant British media and public reaction to Zeebrugge, but in the Admiralty {{and particularly in the}} Allied Naval and Marine Forces the failure to completely neutralise Bruges rankled.|$|E

He notes that the film's [...] "big reveal" [...] is hardly a revelation. And as frightening as the hoodlums want themselves to appear, their sense of menace never surfaces the way it ought to. Also, their good-cop, bad-cop attitude gets old fast, and we never get to know much about them. However, these minor grumbles are just that - minor grumbles".|$|R

5|$|Civilians in Masan posed an {{unexpectedly}} dangerous {{problem for the}} UN forces. The town had a large community of Communist sympathizers and agents. At {{the peak of the}} North Korean offensive, Han Gum Jo, manager of the Masan branch of the Korean Press Association, confessed that he was chief of the South Korean Labor Party in Masan and that he had been funneling information to the North Koreans through a Pusan headquarters. Additionally, the chief of the Masan prison guards was found to be the head of a Communist cell that included seven of his subordinates. This, and other counterintelligence information, came to light {{at a time when the}} most intense fighting was in progress only a <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Kean considered the situation so dangerous that he ordered Masan evacuated of all people except police, public officials, railroad and utility workers, and necessary laborers and their families. Evacuation was to be completed in five days. On September 10 and 11 alone the 25th Division evacuated more than 12,000 people by Landing Ship Tank (LST) from Masan.|$|E
5|$|On September 27, 1947, the Kings County {{council in}} New York City of the Army and Navy Union {{under the command}} of General Samuel Hoch made {{available}} an escort party for the families who were having their soldier dead brought home from World War II.

He also coordinated the Brooklyn Naval Yard Garrison of the organization later, that participated in the Freedom Train Brooklyn display at the Vanderveer Park freight yards of the Long Island Rail Road. There were thousands that saw the one-day Brooklyn event that displayed Americana and original nineteenth-century historical documents in the rail cars.

5|$|The script {{demanded a}} dry location: an {{agricultural}} village {{where it had}} not rained in several years. To depict the 1890s era, the crew also required a village which lacked electricity, communication and automobiles. Kutch faced the same problems {{at that time and}} hence the village of Kunariya, located a <b>few</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Bhuj, was chosen. During the filming of Lagaan, it did not rain at all in the region. However, a week after the shoot finished, it rained heavily bringing relief to Bhuj, which had a lean monsoon the previous year. The typical old Kutch hamlet was built by the local people four months before the arrival of the crew. The 2001 Gujarat earthquake devastated this region and displaced many locals. The crew, including the English, contributed to their cause by donating , with further contributions during the year.|$|E
50|$|Meeting {{with the}} head of the {{education}} board to plead Maruge’s case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback and random acts of violence against the school, Jane soon receives a letter that she is to be transferred to another educational institute a <b>few</b> hundred <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Whereas Gerry Anderson had {{a rocket}} ship in Fireball XL5 that could travel light years to planets around other stars {{as though they}} were just a <b>few</b> million <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> Space Patrol took a more {{realistic}} approach. Because of limited speed, trips to other planets in our solar system could take weeks or months and this was facilitated by the crew of the Galasphere going into a freezer chamber and being put in suspended animation for the trip. A robot would then take over (its movements were said to cost £2,000 a time rather than being just a puppet.) The zirgon ray (faster than light) could be used from Earth to wake them up in an emergency. The term [...] "galaxy" [...] was used inaccurately, but consistently, to refer to a solar system in the series, so [...] "Galactic Control" [...] only supervised the local planets and [...] "other galaxies" [...] referred to nearby star-systems.|$|R

40|$|From {{epidemiological}} data obtained {{over more than}} 20 years by surveys conducted {{in different parts of}} Sicily, it is evident that Sicily is a high-risk area for multiple sclerosis (MS). This is in sharp contrast with the gradient hypothesis. High frequencies have been found {{in different parts of the}} island having different geoclimatic features, but at least two cities (Monreale and Enna) had had a prolonged Norman domination. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that MS originated in Northern Europe and spread around the world throughout the raids of the northern peoples. The increase in frequency estimated by follow-up and incidence studies is well established and is only in part linked to the improvement in diagnostic techniques. Finally, it is noteworthy that in the islands of Malta, a <b>few</b> sea <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from Sicily, the MS prevalence rates are in the range of 4 - 8 cases per 100 000 persons. This occurrence represents a natural model to investigate MS etiology through analytic studies and genetic analyses. © Springer-Verlag 2001...|$|R

Arnor's capital of Fornost lay upon the North Downs only a <b>few</b> dozen <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> from the Weather Hills, and Angmar sought a way to break through the frontier and lay siege to the city. It was to this end that in the year TA 1409 a great host came out of Angmar, and crossing the river it entered Cardolan and surrounded Amon Sûl. After a fierce siege the Dúnedain of Arnor were defeated, the tower of Amon Sûl destroyed, and King Arveleg slain.

50|$|The {{company began}} in 1867 as the William Butcher Steel Works. The {{products}} that founders William Butcher, Jr. (a {{son of the}} founder of W. & S. Butcher Steel Works, a scion of the Sheffield, England steel industry) and Philip Syng Justice (an American manufacturer) planned to produce were cast-steel locomotive tires (that is, in British spelling, tyres) and cast-steel forgings, {{with a plan to}} make eventually a promising new product: steel rails, which would be far superior to older iron ones. At about this time in nearby Bethlehem, the predecessor company of Bethlehem Steel was also getting into the steel rail business. The Nicetown site was chosen because plenty of the anthracite coal that moved by river, canal, and rail from northeast Pennsylvania passed by Nicetown on its way to Port Richmond. Anthracite was superior to bituminous coal for steelmaking. Nicetown's proximity to one of the principal locomotive-building plants of the western hemisphere, the Baldwin Locomotive Works (which at the time was just a <b>few</b> rail-served <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> in the Spring Garden neighborhood), was another benefit of the site.|$|R
