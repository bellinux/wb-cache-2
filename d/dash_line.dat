5000|$|The {{position}} of China on its maritime claims based on UNCLOS and {{history has been}} ambiguous, particularly with the nine <b>dash</b> <b>line</b> map. For example, in its notes verbales in 2011, the first phrase stated that China has undisputed sovereignty over the islands and the adjacent waters, suggesting China is claiming sovereignty over its territorial waters, a position consistent with UNCLOS. However, the second phrase in its notes verbales stated that China enjoys sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the relevant waters along with the seabed and subsoil contained in this region, suggesting that China is claiming sovereignty over all of the maritime space (includes all the geographic features and the waters within the nine <b>dash</b> <b>line).</b> The third phrase indicates support for basing their claims on historical basis as well. Recently in its notes verbales in 2011, China has explicitly stated that it claims the territorial waters {{and all of the}} islands in which each island has its own exclusive economic zone and continental shelf. A major problem with this claim is that it fails to distinguish between geographic features considered as [...] "islands" [...] or [...] "rocks" [...] under UNCLOS. The vast majority of international legal experts have concluded that China's claims based on historical claims are invalid. Many ambiguities arise from the notion of historical claims as a basis for claiming sovereignty and is inherently ambiguous.|$|E

These included, inter alia, complaints concerning China’s activities within the area enclosed by the nine <b>dash</b> <b>line,</b> the status of maritime features within the maritime enclosure and alleged environmental damage caused by Chinese dredging and infrastructure building activities within the contested area. On 12 July 2016 the PCA rendered its judgment on the merits of the case.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} a novel structured light pattern {{designed to be}} compatible with the spatial light modulator (SLM) projection. The proposed pattern is a De Bruijn-based sequence applied {{to a combination of}} continuous and <b>dashed</b> <b>lines</b> for the pattern. The sequence is coded in the period and duty cycles of the <b>dashed</b> <b>lines.</b> It provides 16 different lines which limits to two the required number of <b>dashed</b> <b>lines</b> needed for identification. The segmentation has been made easier by alternating continuous and <b>dashed</b> <b>lines.</b> As required by the use of SLMs, the sequence has been adapted by making it symmetric. It has been improved by guaranteeing a hamming distance equal to two for two successive <b>dashed</b> <b>lines.</b> The implementation on a virtual model has shown that a subpixel accuracy has been achieved.

30|$|In practice, the {{receiver}} will request the sender {{to send the}} watermarked image again if the received image quality is below an acceptable criterion. Such a condition forms a constraint {{for the application of}} visible watermarking since the image feasibility is essential to convince {{the receiver}} to take what is offered. In Figure 2, a horizontal <b>dash</b> <b>line</b> represents the acceptable image quality requirement where the equilibrium condition for both encoder and attack must above it. Otherwise, the attacked watermarked image will be rejected by the receiver. To fulfill our design methodology, we leverage the study of COCOA [12] to adaptive COCOA (ACOCOA) approach and develop a dynamic game-theoretic architecture for the watermark embedding problem which is described as a dynamic non-cooperative game with complete information [4]. The ideal strategy developed in Section. 3.2 is defined by the Nash equilibrium of the game [4]. The detailed information about ACOCOA will be explained in the following.|$|E
