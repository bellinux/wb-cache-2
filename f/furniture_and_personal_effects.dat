6000|$|As {{this was}} said {{significantly}} Edwin did not deign a reply, but, {{leaning back in}} a corner, gazed out {{at the window and}} brooded over his unhappy fate. Truly he had something to brood over. Besides being in the unpleasant position which we have described, he had quite recently lost his only relative, a [...] "rich uncle," [...] as he was called, who had brought Edwin up and had led him to believe that he should be his heir. It was found, however, on the examination of the old gentleman's affairs, that his fortune was a myth, and that his house, <b>furniture,</b> <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> <b>effects</b> would have to be sold in order to pay his debts. When all was settled, Edwin Gurwood found himself cast upon his own resources with good health, a kind but wayward disposition, a strong handsome frame, a middling education, and between three and four hundred pounds in his pocket. He soon found that this amount of capital melted with alarming rapidity under the influence of a good appetite and expensive tastes, so he resolved at once to commence work of some kind. But what was he to turn to? His uncle had allowed him to do as he pleased. Naturally it pleased the energetic and enthusiastic boy to learn very little of anything useful, to read an immense amount of light literature, and to indulge in much open-air exercise.|$|E

60|$|Of the females, {{there were}} but two {{who had arrived}} at womanhood; though several white-headed, olive-skinned faces were peering out of the {{foremost}} wagon of the train, with eyes of lively curiosity and characteristic animation. The elder of the two adults, was the sallow and wrinkled mother {{of most of the}} party, and the younger was a sprightly, active, girl, of eighteen, who in figure, dress, and mien, seemed to belong to a station in society several gradations above that of any one of her visible associates. The second vehicle was covered with a top of cloth so tightly drawn, as to conceal its contents, with the nicest care. The remaining wagons were loaded with such rude <b>furniture</b> <b>and</b> other <b>personal</b> <b>effects,</b> as might be supposed to belong to one, ready at any moment to change his abode, without reference to season or distance.|$|R
5000|$|Soon {{after the}} death of Andy Warhol, Gamble was {{permitted}} access to the artist’s East 66th Street, Manhattan apartment to photograph his art work, <b>furniture</b> <b>and</b> myriad of <b>personal</b> <b>effects.</b> The project was commissioned by Sotheby’s as part of the publicity for their auction of Warhol’s property. A decade later in January 1998, Gamble exhibited a collection of the photographs, taken over a period of eight days, at the Groucho Club in London. Images of Warhol were digitally superimposed on several of the photographs, creating the feeling that to Paul Vallely of The Independent seemed as though “the dead man haunted the photographs of his living spaces.” ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{died at the}} age of 95, on 11 July 1954. In his will, he {{stipulated that}} his body was to be cremated, the ashes to be scattered, and that there should be no flowers, {{tombstone}} or other memorial. He left his <b>furniture</b> <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> <b>effects</b> to his [...] "friend" [...] Mrs Lily Colburn (who shared his address), and the rest of his estate to be divided equally between his wife (who died in 1962) and this [...] "friend." ...|$|E
50|$|Three {{houses are}} {{included}} in the protected monument, and have been restored as nearly as possible to their 1962 condition by the demolition of improvements effected since that date.

50|$|Greenmount Homestead at Walkerston {{demonstrates}} a now uncommon aspect of Queensland's cultural heritage, {{as the main}} house and its associated outbuildings and structures, and the formal garden, <b>furniture</b> <b>and</b> <b>personal</b> <b>effects,</b> form a cohesive and intact grouping which together demonstrate {{a way of life}} no longer common. The house, together with the large group of associated outbuildings and structures and the formal garden, and the physical arrangement of these elements, are important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of an early 20th century Queensland homestead complex. The place is important in exhibiting a range of aesthetic characteristics valued by the local community, in particular the landmark contribution of the buildings and grounds, through form, scale and siting; the quality and intactness of the interiors, including early fixtures and furnishings; and the landscaping, including the substantially intact formal garden. It has a strong association with the local community, which perceives the place as an historically significant element in the Mackay/Walkerston cultural landscape. It has a special association with the Cook family and their contribution {{to the development of the}} Mackay region and to the growth of the sugar and cattle breeding industries in Queensland over more than 120 years.|$|E

Before the building was cleared, Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, who had helped hide the families, returned to the hiding place against the orders of the Dutch police <b>and</b> rescued some <b>personal</b> <b>effects.</b> Amongst the items they retrieved was The Diary of Anne Frank.|$|R
