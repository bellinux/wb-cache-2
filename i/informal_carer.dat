40|$|Original title: Portretten van Mantelzorgers. There {{are more}} than a million people in the Netherlands {{providing}} informal care, making this the most widely given form of care. Who are these informal carers and why are they willing to spend sometimes years selflessly helping others? This publication gives a voice to informal carers themselves. During four group discussions, in which nearly 40 male and female informal carers took part, they talked at length about their daily lives and about what it is like to care for a loved one. They also described the problems they encountered and their contacts with the authorities. One striking finding to emerge was that many informal carers have comparable working styles. Six of these styles are considered in this report: the born <b>informal</b> <b>carer,</b> the dynamic <b>informal</b> <b>carer,</b> the angry <b>informal</b> <b>carer,</b> the resigned <b>informal</b> <b>carer,</b> the indispensable <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> and the overstressed <b>informal</b> <b>carer.</b> 16 informal carers with a specific working style recount their stories in the report. The differences between male and female carers also receive wide attention. The final chapter looks at what policymakers and professionals can learn from this diversity in the informal care circuit. What are the traps in the life of the born <b>informal</b> <b>carer?</b> Who manages to cope successfully with the personal budget system? How should the angry <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> be approached? What is the best way to help the indispensable carer?

The thinking of adults and <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> could be understood in terms of the moral dimension of hazards, through the distinction between risks, to be calculated, and dangers, to be avoided. Adults and <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> within families largely agreed in their categorization of hazards but differences were found. In families where the head of the household had had a professional or skilled manual occupation, adults and <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> were most likely to agree that hazards for the adult were dangers to be avoided. In families which had a history of unemployment or unskilled occupations adults and <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> were most likely to treat certain hazards as risks to be taken. The latter families were also less likely to have 2 <b>informal</b> <b>carers.</b> Adults from more risk-tolerant families appeared to be achieving more of their potential in everyday living skills.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} some of the results arising from a study into the inter-relationships between the dementing elderly in the community, and their informal and formal carers. The results from one phase of the study, which gathered data from informal carers, were used in the development of an attitudinal questionnaire. The questionnaire was distributed to a sample of 60 formal carers drawn {{from a wide variety of}} health, social and voluntary services. The questionnaire sought to gather data about the formal carers' responses to their work with dementing people and their co-resident informal carers. The results of the questionnaire indicated that most of the formal carers believed that it was part of their job to maintain the dementing person in their own home and that they were effective in doing this. However, many of the respondents were uncertain whether homecare was best for the dementing person. The results also suggested that the majority of respondents felt that maintaining the dementing person at home was not detrimental to the informal carers welfare and that their intervention was effective in supporting the <b>informal</b> <b>carer.</b> These findings are discussed within the context of the <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> phase of the study and demonstrate some variance between the formal and <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> perspectives of care control and the significance of formal carer input...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{is limited}} {{literature}} specific to manual handling practices among <b>informal</b> <b>carers,</b> with most literature relating to nurses and paid carers.

40|$|The {{increasing}} ageing {{population is}} demanding new care approaches {{to maintain the}} quality of life of elderly people. <b>Informal</b> <b>carers</b> are becoming crucial agents in the care and support of elderly people, which can lead to those carers suffering from additional stress due to competing priorities with employment or due to lack of knowledge about elderly people?s care needs. Thus, support and stress relief in carers should be a key issue in the home-care process of these older adults.

Objectives: In addition to diagnosing the disease, establishing the care {{needs of people}} suffering from dementia is of paramount importance. Based on a literature review and expert advice, a working document has been drawn up in this article to determine the care diagnosis of dementia patients living at home. Method: The components of care diagnosis were listed {{by means of a}} systematic literature review. The inventory was then further adapted and a working document was developed using semi-structured interviews of sixteen professional caregivers and two informal carers. Results: The literature on care diagnosis is recent, and {{there are only a few}} studies with unequivocal results. However, all authors agree that making an inventory of the care needs results in better care planning and a better quality of life for both patient and <b>informal</b> <b>carer.</b> A synthesis of the literature review and semi-structured interviews led to a working document proposing the creation of an inventory of the care needs for a dementia patient living at home and his/her <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> during a multidisciplinary consultation.

40|$|Introduction: Research {{acknowledges}} {{the relevance of}} social support and coping strategies to manage the pressure of care experienced by <b>informal</b> <b>carers,</b> where ICT-based services like telecare and telehealth can provide more effective and efficient support to individuals compared with traditional interventions. Nevertheless there is still little evidence of their benefits of these technological services for <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> and on the factors associated with their successful development and transfer. Aims and objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to study how the technologies for independent living of the elderly affect the <b>informal</b> <b>carers,</b> and to identify the policy role to develop and scale these technological services in the European Union. Methods: The methodology was to map the most relevant ICT-based initiatives existing in Europe to support <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> of older people living in the community. We develop an impact assessment methodology that identified the most relevant factors of impact. We then carried out them an in-depth analysis of 5 selected good practices of telecare and telehealth in European countries to better understand the impact of such services. Moreover, we cross- analysed of 12 good practices of ICT based services for <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> to identify the key success factors to develop such services. Results: We found that telecare and telehealth provide relief, independence and peace of mind for <b>informal</b> <b>carers.</b> This allows carers to have more active social lives and more time for themselves. These tools can guarantee a decreased in demand by carers and care recipients for support and care services. The research also evidenced that key issues for the success of telecare and telehealth is to articulate a multi-level policy framework based mainly on policy leadership, combination of funding programmes, and support of intermediaries (in particular the third sector). Conclusions: Telecare and telehealth are technologies for elderly people that can also benefit <b>informal</b> <b>carers.</b> Challenges still exist for their development, but a multi-level policy framework can help for the success.

40|$|Background: At a {{time when}} health and social care {{services}} in European countries are under pressure to contain or cut costs, <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> are relied upon as the main providers of long-term care. However, still {{little is known about}} the availability of direct and indirect support for <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> across the European Union. Methods: Primary data collection in all EU member states was supplemented with an extensive review of the available literature. Results: Various forms and levels of support have been implemented across Europe to facilitate the role of informal caregivers. Financial support is the most common type of support provided, followed by respite care and training. Most countries do not have a process in place to systematically identify <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> and to assess their needs. Policies are often at an early stage of development and the breadth of support varies significantly across the EU. Conclusions: Policy developments are uneven across the member states, with some countries having mechanisms in place to assess the needs and support <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> while others are only starting to take an interest in developing support services. Given the unprecedented challenges posed by population ageing, further research and better data are needed to capture and monitor information on <b>informal</b> <b>carers,</b> to help design adequate support policies and eventually to evaluate their impact across the EU...|$|R

40|$|The Significance of Family {{relations}} to Informal Carers’ Needs in interaction with Health Services This {{article is based}} on a study aiming to explore informal carers’ needs and experiences in their contact with health services. The stud y was accomplished in 2011 and consisted of two sub - studies: a survey addressing informal carers in general and a focus - group study, where the participants were informal carers to one or more family members. In this article, the qualitative data from both studies are emphasised: the open written statements in the questionnaires and the focus - group interviews. The results show a similarity in informal carers’ needs and experiences independent of the patients’ diagnoses. However, we find that the needs are re lated to the family relation between the <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> and patient.

40|$|Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{a chronic}} and {{progressive}} neurodegenerative disorder that causes {{a variety of}} motor and non-motor symptoms (Aoun et al., 2012; Lorenz & Dueschl, 2014; Swick, 2012). Of the non-motor symptoms, sleep disorders {{are one of the}} most common (Pal, 2009; Schulte & Winkelmann, 2011), and can result in significant problems for both the person with PD and their <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> (Arberm & Venn, 2011; McLoughlin et al. 2010). A current limitation in the treatment of sleep disorders in PD is that evidence based recommendations are currently lacking (Miereles et al., 2012; Trotti & Bliwise, 2013). Furthermore, factors related to sleep disturbances for this population are poorly understood, particularly in a rural context where little PD research has been undertaken (Duncan & Rositano, 2010). The present study investigated factors related to sleep disturbances for PD in a rural context. This included examination of factors related to sleep disturbances for individuals with PD and informal PD carers; and the dyadic sleep relationship between the individual with PD and their <b>informal</b> <b>carer.</b> Participants were a convenience sample recruited from the Queensland Parkinson’s Project (QPP) database. Overall, 49 individuals with PD completed the study questionnaire. Of these 29 had an <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> who also completed a separate study questionnaire. The study questionnaires contained questions relating to PD symptoms, sleep disturbances, anxiety, depression, personal well-being, quality of life, carer burden, sleep hygiene and sleep-related cognitions. Based on participant responses, all PD participants currently experienced sleep disturbances, with 73 % reporting symptoms to a problematic level. Seventy percent had reported the sleep problem to a health professional and of these most commonly a neurologist (44 %). Medication was the most advised sleep intervention (63 %); however, it had a low adherence rate due to reported negative side effects. A variety of sleep problem types common to PD were reported, including sleep onset and maintenance difficulty. Across sleep disturbance types, at the time of the survey a significant number of PD participants were using no intervention to assist their sleep disturbances. Additional factors related to sleep problems were identified and included depression, anxiety, quality of life, negative cognitions related to the sleep problem, sleep hygiene behaviours, and PD symptoms. The majority of informal carers also reported currently experiencing sleep disturbances, with 66 % reporting this at a problematic level. A variety of sleep problem types were commonly experienced by informal carers. This included sleep onset problems and disturbed sleep maintenance. Reasons given for the sleep disturbances included the need to care nocturnally for the person with PD, and their PD symptoms (e. g., jerking and twitching). Less than half of informal carers with a sleeping problem had advised a medical or allied health professional of this problem. The GP was the health professional to whom problems were most commonly reported (78 %). Medication was the most commonly advised sleep intervention (44 %). Other factors related to sleep problems for informal carers included carer burden, depression, anxiety, poor quality of life, negative cognitions related to their sleep problem, and poor sleep hygiene behaviours. All PD and <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> dyads experienced sleep disturbance. Fifty-nine percent of dyads reported both the individual with PD and their <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> as having problematic sleep disturbance, while in 31 % only one member of the dyad, and in 10 % neither reported the sleep disturbance to a problematic level. PD sleep problems were found to be related to <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> depression, anxiety, and carer burden. The informal carer’s sleep was found to be related to anxiety, as well as motor complications, in the person they cared for. Overall, the present study findings support the view that a number of factors are related to sleep disturbances in PD and informal carers both on an individual level, and also when examined within a dyadic sleep relationship. It also highlights the need for an evidence-based sleep intervention related to these factors that is adaptable to the barriers associated with supporting individuals with PD and informal carers in rural areas. If developed, such support could assist in improving quality of life and reducing carer burden...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To explore {{associations}} between carer burden {{and characteristics of}} (1) the <b>informal</b> <b>carer,</b> (2) the person with dementia, and (3) the care support network in 8 European countries. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: People with dementia judged at risk of admission to long-term care (LTC) facilities in 8 European countries (Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom). Participants: A total of 1223 people with dementia supported by community services at home or receiving day care or respite care and their informal carers. Measurements: Variables regarding the <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> included familial relationship and living situation. Variables relating to the person with dementia included cognitive functioning (S-MMSE), neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI-Q), depressive symptoms (Cornell depression scale), comorbidity (Charlson Comorbidity Index), and physical functioning (Katz Activity of Daily Living [ADL] Index). The care support network was measured using hours of caregiving (ADLs, instrumental ADLs [IADLs], supervision), additional informal care support, and service receipt (home care, day care). Experience of carer burden was recorded using the Zarit Burden Interview. Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} determine factors associated with high carer burden. Results: Carer burden was highest in Estonia (mean 39. 7 / 88) and lowest in the Netherlands (mean 26. 5 / 88). High burden was significantly associated with characteristics of the <b>informal</b> <b>carer</b> (family relationship, specifically wives or daughters), of the person with dementia (physical dependency in ADLs; neuropsychiatric symptoms, in particular nighttime behaviors and irritability), the care support network (hours of caregiving supervision; receipt of other informal care support) and country of residence. Conclusion: A range of factors are associated with burden in informal carers of people with dementia judged to be on the margins of LTC. Support for informal carers needs to take account of gender differences. The dual challenges of distressed behaviors and difficulties in ADLs by the person with dementia may be addressed by specific nonpharmacological interventions focusing on both elements. The potential protective effect of additional informal support to carers highlights the importance of peer support or better targeted home support services. The implementation of appropriate and tailored interventions to reduce burden by supporting informal carers may enable people with dementia to remain at home for longer...|$|E

40|$|Effective home {{support in}} {{dementia}} is key in delaying nursing home admission. However, home support is frequently not {{tailored to the}} individual needs of people with dementia. Staff allocating home support services may not identify important care needs, which only be recognised by <b>informal</b> <b>carers.</b> The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the balance of informal and formal home support and their associated costs from the perspectives of both <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> and paid staff. Five case vignettes of people with dementia were designed based on an existing English data set from a European study into transition into long-term care (the RightTimePlaceCare programme), representing 42 per cent of the English sample. In total, 14 <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> and 14 paid staff were consulted in separate groups, as expert panels, regarding their recommendations for home care services for each vignette. Care recommendations of carers and staff were costed based on nationally available unit costs and compared. <b>Informal</b> <b>carers</b> allocated fewer hours of care than staff. Personal and domestic home care and day care centres were the most frequently recommended formal services by both groups, and some vignettes of people with dementia were recommended for care home admission. The ratio of costs of informal versus formal support was relatively equal for paid staff, yet unbalanced from the perspectives of <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> with a greater proportion of formal care costs.

40|$|<b>Informal</b> <b>carers</b> provide {{important}} emotional support to patients having chemotherapy and assistance in monitoring and managing side-effects. If they are inadequately supported in this, patient and carer morbidity may result. This study explored needs of <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> supporting patients with cancer having chemotherapy. The study used a mixed methods approach. Carers of colorectal or lymphoma cancer patients at one comprehensive cancer centre participated.

Fifty-nine <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> {{were invited to}} participate; 48 returned the questionnaire (response rate 81 %) and 13 were interviewed. Informal carers' needs for information about chemotherapy and its side-effects were largely met although a third felt completely or somewhat unprepared to deal with particular symptoms experienced by patients at home. Many carers had unmet needs regarding financial support and their own needs as carers. Assertiveness was important to many caring roles, but it appeared difficult for <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> to adopt when they were unsupported in this and their role was unrecognised by health professionals.

40|$|Background: Tailor-made care in {{dementia}} {{requires an}} individual needs assessment. The Camberwell Assessment of Need for the Elderly (CANE) {{was developed to}} assess needs of older people with mental disorders. In this study the validity and reliability of the Dutch version of the CANE were studied among community-dwelling persons with dementia and their <b>informal</b> <b>carers.</b> Method: Interviews were carried out with 236 people with mild to severe dementia and 322 informal carers; 69 <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> were interviewed twice. Construct and criterion validity and test-retest reliability of the CANE were studied using data for <b>informal</b> <b>carers.</b> Construct validity was also studied for CANE ratings of people with dementia. Results: The {{construct validity of the}} CANE was good among people with dementia and <b>informal</b> <b>carers.</b> Criterion validity could be studied for 76. 9 % of the CANE items, and all significant correlations were convergent. Test-retest reliability of the CANE varied from poor to very good and was best on domains where needs were explicit and problems well defined. Conclusions: Use of the Dutch version of the CANE among community-dwelling people with dementia and their carers is supported by the study results, with the study showing acceptable construct and criterion validity and test-retest reliability of the CANE. © 2008 International Psychogeriatric Association...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the {{benefits}} of information and communication technologies (ICT) -based services for <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> and paid assistants of older people living in the community. We cross-case analysed the effects of twelve initiatives in the EU, the USA and Canada, based on their individual analysis documented through interviews with promoters and a literature review. We carried out the cross-case analysis following a variables-oriented strategy on seven dimensions of impact at micro-, meso- and macro-levels: the quality of life of <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> and paid assistants, quality of life of care recipients, quality of care, care efficiency and sustainability, acceptability, and infrastructure and accessibility. ICT-based services for <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> and paid assistants improve the quality of life of older people and their carers and access to qualified care. They also generate savings which contribute to the sustainability of the care systems. These findings constitute a first look at the benefits of the use of ICT-based services for <b>informal</b> <b>carers</b> and paid assistants. Nevertheless, more research using experimental methods is needed to demonstrate the impact of these ICT-based services at meso- and macro-levels. This would help to support policy-makers to deploy these technologies for long-term care delivery. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R
