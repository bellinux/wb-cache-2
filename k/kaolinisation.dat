An abundance of kaolinite was formed within the St Austell granite pluton of Cornwall, southwest England, by the hydrous dissolution of feldspar crystals. The permeability of Cornish granites is low and alteration acts pervasively from discontinuity features, with montmorillonite recognised as an intermediate assemblage in partially kaolinised material. Structural features allowed fluids to channel through the impermeable granite and pervade deep into the rock. Areas of high structural control are hypothesised to link well with areas of advanced alteration. As <b>kaolinisation</b> results in a loss of competence, we present a method of utilising discontinuity orientations from nearby unaltered granites alongside the local tectonic history to calculate strain rates and delineate a discrete fracture network. Simulation of the discrete fracture network is demonstrated through a case study at Higher Moor, where kaolinite is actively extracted from a pit. Reconciliation of fracture connectivity and permeability against measured subsurface data show that higher values of modelled properties match with advanced <b>kaolinisation</b> observed in the field.

30|$|Dissolution {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the construction of unconformity reservoir quality (Wei et al. 1998). It is widely developed in semi-weathered rock layers. The dissolution pore types are mainly intergranular dissolved pores, intragranular dissolved pores and intercrystalline solution pores. Intergranular dissolved pores are primary pores followed by intragranular dissolved pores, while the intercrystalline solution pores are very rare existed. Dissolved substances mainly include feldspar, debris and carbonate cements. Dissolution pores account for a large proportion of pore space and two periods of dissolution can be easily identified. It is deduced that the early dissolution occurred after <b>kaolinisation</b> and before quartz overgrowth while the late dissolution occurred after siderite cementation and many residual primary intergranular pores and dissolution pores are filled and disseminated by later iron clay montmorillonite, as shown in Fig.  2 c–f.|$|E

40|$|During the {{antarctic}} summer season in 1984 and 1986 field studies and laboratory {{investigations of the}} Mesozoic Intrusive Suite of the Palmer Archipel were carried out {{in cooperation with the}} Chilean Antarctic Institute and the University of Concepcion, Volcanic formations and intrusive series are the dominant exposed rocks together with very subordinate metasediments. Different petrological and isotopic data allow to divide the Antarctic Intrusive Suite into two intrusive types: a) Palmer Batholith (Lower Cenozoic) b) Costa Danco intrusive rocks (Upper Cretaceous). Both types belong to a calc-alkaline series. The granitoid rocks show an I-type-affinity. Ore minerals (pyrite, chalcopyrite, bornite, covellite, cuprite, pyrrhotite, magnetite and ilmenite) are mainly restricted to the intermediate rock types (e. g. granodiorites}. Propylitisation and <b>kaolinisation</b> are the observed alteration types, which suggest, together with the disseminated and vein-like ore fabrics the comparison with the andean Porphyry-Copper- and vein-type-deposits. The volcanic formations are subdivided into a) the Upper Cretaceous Wiencke Formation, which is composed of andesites and andesitic breccias, and b) into the Jurassic Lautaro Formation with basaltic, andesitic, dacitic and some rhyolitic rocks together with volcanic breccias.

40|$|Nanjizal {{is one of}} the few {{locations}} in the southern segment of the Land's End Granite (Early Permian) where magmatic-hydrothermal tin mineralization has been worked. Three principal mineralization episodes are recognized. The first episode comprises steeply dipping ENE-WSW striking tourmaline quartz veins precipitated from magmatic-hydrothermal fluids during regional NNW-SSE extension; they are not associated with metalliferous mineralization. The second episode is represented by two sets of vertical/subvertical tourmaline veins striking, respectively, 280 degrees and 340 degrees. The NNW striking set hosts tourmaline-quartz-cassiterite (alkali feldspar, apatite, zircon) mineralization and was worked for tin during the 19 (th) Century. The first generation of tourmaline in these veins is dominated by the Mg-rich end-member, dravite. The subsequent two generations of tourmaline are dominated by the Ferich end-member, schorl, together with zoned cassiterite with Fe-rich cores and Fe-poor rims. The NNW striking tourmaline-quartz-cassiterite veins at Nanjizal have a similar orientation to cassiterite-bearing veins within the St. just Mining District further north. It is possible that the mineralization at Nanjizal was contemporaneous with mineralization in the St. Just Mining District and hence related to a later magmatic episode and the renewed release of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids during ENE-WSW extension. The third mineralization episode is dominated by steeply dipping WNW-NNW striking quartz-limonite-chalcedonyveins that are associated with wall rock hematisation and <b>kaolinisation.</b> Schorl-quartz-cassiterite mineralisation is relatively uncommon in S. W. England but there are remarkable similarities between the vein parageneses at Nanjizal and the Birch Tor-Vitifer area of Dartmoor; both are likely to have been sourced from predominantly magmatic-hydrothermal fluids...|$|E
40|$|Goonbarrow, a China Clay pit {{situated}} {{within the}} St. Austell granite China Clay region, {{is the subject}} of a varied geochemical and isotopic study to determine the mode of genesis of the kaolinite and associated tin/tungsten mineralisation. Detailed geological mapping in conjunction with a geochemical study of the micas indicated that Goonbarrow is situated at the junction of the petrographically distinct phases of the St. Austell granite. An unusual assymmetric curved-feldspar-crystal pegmatite is found at the junction. Elvans at Goonbarrow and three other locations within the St. Austell granite are shown to be intruded during hydrothermal activity and in some cases after major vein formation. Three main types of vein were recognised in Goonbarrow, the major ones being spatially associated with zones of kaolinised granite. A potassium/ argon age study showed that the granites, pegmatite and greisens (and by inference tin/tungsten mineralisation) were formed at about 280 ± 10 m. y. Four elvans, including Goonbarrow, were dated at around 272 m. y. Three of these elvans crosscut major vein, swarms. Age determinations on fine grained muscovite produced predominantly during <b>kaolinisation</b> and several kaolinised potassium feldspars also gave Hercynian eges. Scanning electron microscopy studies on daughter minerals in fluid inclusions indicated the presence of Al, As, Ca, Cl, Cu, Fe, K, Kg, Mn, Na, S, Sn and Zn although many of these elements were not present in minerals in the pit. Temperatures, pressures and salinities of vein fluids were determined by conventional fluid inclusion studies, which also indicated that the veins vere boiling. Hydrogen and oxygen isotope studies on vein quartz and greisen muscovites coupled with a re-interpretation of previous work and the fluid inclusion study produced a new model for the genesis of Cornish China Clay. Kaolinite genesis from the vapour phase of hot boiling fluids intimately associated with greisen bordered quartz/tourmaline veins of Hercynian age is favoured. </p...|$|E
40|$|When {{hydrothermal}} fluids {{flow through}} microfractures in quartz, they effectively heal (anneal) them to produce Fluid Inclusion Planes (FIPs). These FIPs {{are viewed as}} a three dimensional plane or array of secondary fluid inclusions and {{may be used to}} relate brittle deformation associated with tectonic, thermal and hydraulic stresses to contemporaneous hydrothermal events. In this study, FIPs have been interpreted in granitic quartz from various geological settings. Analysis of the FIPs includes recording their orientation, the morphological characteristics of both the FIPs and the inclusions contained within them, together with the thermometric properties of the inclusions. Results show that FIPs may possess a preferential orientation over a wide area, similar to the trend of macrostructures observed in the field. However, local deviations in the stress field, related to the proximity of possible second order faults, may cause local deviations in the orientation of the FIPs. The presence of high FIP abundances has also been linked to the widespread, localised development of <b>kaolinisation</b> (possibly linked to tectonic stresses) and greisenisation (possibly linked to thermal and hydraulic stresses). These phenomena have been identified at several localities in the field areas. It is presumed that intense microfracture networks will allow the wide-spread movement of hydrothermal fluids allowing pervasive alteration. A classification scheme for FIPs has been devised, whereby FIPs may been classified as tensile, dilatant (mode 1) and dilatant shear (mode 2) fractures. This classification is based upon the orientation of the FIPs (to macro structures), their proposed origin and their morphology (both the FIP and the inclusions contained within them). Variation in inclusion morphology has been recorded within selected FIPs. Inclusions have been observed to occur parallel and perpendicular (rare) to the length of the FIP. The presence of a preferred shape orientation in the inclusions has been attributed to a combination of fracturing and subsequent healing process, with controlling parameters including the temperature and chemistry of the fluids (affecting crack lifetimes) together with the geometry of the fracture network...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a {{reconnaissance}} geochemical drainage Introduction survey across an area of 850 km 2 in the Cheviot Hills are reported. At each of the 708 sample sites, the - 0. 15 mm fraction of the stream sediment, a panned heavy mineral concentrate derived from the - 2 mm fraction of the stream sediment and a water sample were collected. Be, B, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Zr, MO, Sn, Ba, Ph and Lo 1 were determined in stream sediment samples; Ti, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Zr, MO, Sn, Sb, Ba, Ce, Pb, Bi and U in panned concentrate samples and Cu, Zn and Pb in water samples. The survey area is composed largely of andesitic volcanic rocks of Lower Devonian age. Underlying _ Silurian greywackes and shales and overlying Devonian and Carboniferous sedimentary rocks and basaltic lavas are exposed around {{the periphery of the}} volcanic complex. The Cheviot granite crops out on the eastern margin of the area. Anomalous concentrations of metals recorded in the drainage samples are, in general, related to (i) known mineral occurrences, (ii) hydrous oxide precipitation and scavenging processes, (iii) the relatively _ widespread occurrence of baryte, (iv) contamination, (v) tourmalinisation and other hydrothermal activity and (vi) high background levels in unmineralised rocks. At several localities, however, the source of an anomaly is uncertain and some of these may reflect hitherto unknbwn mineralisation. Anomaly groupings and regional variation patterns in the data are influenced by major structures such as the Gyle-Harthope fracture zone. Follow-up investigations into a wide range of metal anomalies in the the Kingsseat area involved more detailed drainage sampling, geological mapping at 1 : 10 000 scale and petrographic, mineralogical and lithogeochemical studies. Rocks, previously mapped as extrusive mica felsites, are reinterpreted as a high level intrusion complex, named the Cock Law Complex, which contains live distinct types of porphyry. Many of the intrusive and extrusive rocks are highly altered and seven alteration assemblages are identified, arising from sericitisation, <b>kaolinisation,</b> silicification, tourmalinisation, haematisation and carbonate alterations. All except haematisation are related to Lower Devonian igneous activity. Metal enrichments were recorded in many of the analysed rocks. The greatest enrichments, for the widest range of elements, occur in samples taken from a gossanous structure, where the mineralisation has features in common with the epithermal precious-metal style of mineralisation associated with sub-aerial volcanism...|$|E
40|$|Tasmanian {{building}} sandstones {{have been}} almost entlrely quarried from fluvial sandstones of the Early Triassic Quartz Sandstone Sequence and the Permian Lower Freshwater Sequence. These {{continue to be the}} only horizons considered prospective for new sources of high quality building sandstone. Technical data on all significant Tasmanian building sandstone sources is presented. There are three methods of assessing and predicting sandstone quality and durability in the built environment: 1) Inferring predicted stone behaviour from measurement of sandstone properties. 2) Accelerated decay tests. 3) Observed performance in existing buildings. Each method is subject to limitations. Optimum assessments are made by interpreting a combination of data from all three approaches, in the light of an {{understanding of the nature of}} sandstone properties and of the processes of sandstone decay. Investigation of the geological processes controlling the genesis of sandstone properties has led to the development of models to facilitate exploration for high quality building sandstones: Most jointing in Parmeener Supergroup sandstone is related to Mid-Mesozoic and Early Tertiary faulting. The areas most prospective for widely-jointed sandstones are predicted on the basis of known regional variations in fault densities. The bulk colour of sandstone is related to the content of iron-rich minerals in the sandstone, particularly vermiculite, smectite and chlorite, which oxidise to yield brown ferruginous colouring. Liesegang rings form in proximity to iron-rich basic igneous rocks, probably through weathering-related groundwater processes. For most building purposes, thick and massively-bedded sandstone is the ideal. There is no way of predicting the occurrence of such beds on a regional or local scale, except insofar as they are more prevalent in the stratigraphlcally lower parts of the Triassic Quartz Sandstone Sequence as a whole. Sandstone strength and porosity are functions of mineralogy and intergranular texture. The geological controls on these properties are discussed. The occurrence of superficial pachydermal fractures on natural outcrops is considered to be an indicator of sandstones having weak intergranular textures resulting in a high degree of dimensional instability. Smectite swelling clay is detrimental to sandstone durability. The proportion of smectite in sandstone varies markedly within individual outcrop areas, but on a larger scale there appear to be regional and possibly stratigraphic patterns in smectite occurrence. The smectite (together with vermiculite) is considered to have formed by alteration of volcanic dust deposited from ash clouds produced by contemporaneous volcanic sources to the southeast of the Tasmania Basin. Weathering of natural outcrops alters important sandstone properties, most importantly through near-surface <b>kaolinisation.</b> An exploration program for high quality building sandstones is proposed which takes account of this limitation, and of the exploration models developed in this work. The major contribution of this thesis is that an understanding has been achieved of the avenues of research which are necessary to further the development of models explaining the genesis of important quality and durability-related sandstone properties. These are listed...|$|E
40|$|Central Victoria {{contains}} more than 100 carbonated mineral water springs, many were discovered when uncovered by alluvial gold mining activities of the 1850 &# 039;s. The mineral springs are located at distances of 2 to 45 km from {{the crest of the}} Great Dividing Range, and are situated at elevations from 700 down to 200 m above sea level. The discharge from individual springs is small, and usually falls in the range 0. 01 0. 4 L/s (0. 3 - 13 ML/annum). The mineral spring waters are cold ranging from around 10 o C at the higher elevations to 17 o C at the springs occurring at lower elevations. The carbonated mineral waters are a facies of the more widely distributed high bicarbonate alkalinity groundwater in the deep circulation systems of Central Victoria. The carbonated mineral waters are mildly acidic (pH 5. 7 - 6. 3), oxidic (Eh + 50 to + 100 mv), have low chloride (median 60 mg/L), high bicarbonate (median 1500 mg/L) and low sulphate (median 18 mg/L) concentrations. The water becomes slightly effervescent on discharge from the springs, and may be vigorously gassy when escaping from bores in the ascension zone. The characteristics of the mineral water chemistry may be explained by clay reactions - proton exchange, carbonate dissolution and base exchange. In the ascension zone heterogeneous thermodynamics, including the dissociation characteristics of a diprotic acid, acidity regulation by non carbonate equilibria, in particular by iron chemistry results in effervescence as pressure, degassing, acidity change and electro neutrality determine the water chemistry. Local characterisation of the m ineral waters arises from a superimposition of flux and mixing relationships encountered in discharge or ascension zones on regional trends. In Central Victoria the bedrock aquifer consists of interbedded lithic and arkosic grits, sandstones and graphitic shales. The most common occurrence is in rocks of Lower Ordovician age, but mineral waters also occur in Cambrian, Upper Silurian and Lower Devonian strata. The rocks have been subjected to variable but low grade regional metamorphism. Sandstone and grit units may retain some primary porosity, and thin intersections of unconsolidated sediment occur in bore holes. Narrow bands of saccharoidal marble and cone-in-cone limestone are present, but carbonates are a minor constituent of the rock mass (0. 5 % - 2 %) and associated diagenetic ankerite. Organic carbon may exceed 5 % in the black graphitic shales. Deep weathering profiles are developed on these rocks with elution of carbonates and <b>kaolinisation</b> silicate minerals. The rocks are folded asymmetrically and cut by strongly developed concordant meridional bearing thrust faults. The linear character of the rock mass failure produces anisotropy and heterogeneity. Deep fissure flow systems emanating from the Great Dividing Range follow litho structural corridors for distances of more than 40 km and groundwater has been observed in the bedrock mines of Central Victoria at depths of more than 1. 6 km. The sustainable management of the mineral water resource involves the maintenance of yield, water quality and public equity. Sustaining Public Equity was initiated in 1865 by the formal establishment of mineral spring reserves. Reserves were proclaimed to preserve the springs from "the ravages of mining, and for public recreation and amusement". At Hepburn the first Pavilion was erected in 1869; a bottling plant in 1880 and a bath house was built in 1890. The region is the centre of balneology and hydrotherapy in Victoria and provides a 150 year history of development, conflict and sustainable resource management resolution. The spring reserves and surrounding buffer areas in the planning schemes offer protection for the discharge zones, but there is increasing tendency to commercialise and encroach on the reserves and allocate the mineral water for commercial or semi commercial development. Past evidence illustrates that management of the water quality, its salinity and gas content, is equally difficu lt as the maintenance of the flow of the springs and the continuation of public equity. Long term sustainable management is an evolving process that recognises past failures and crises. It shares the failure profile exhibited in many examples of overseas development of mineral and thermal waters. Legal Principles and endeavours outside the jurisdiction of the water and environment protection sectors are pre-eminent in the decision making processes. Nevertheless, the existing regulatory processes do have the potential to protect the resource...|$|E
40|$|The Eastern Cape Province has, {{besides the}} three known neotectonic belts (southern, eastern and northern) a fourth zone, which is {{inactive}}. This inactive zone is located almost in its central part {{north of the}} southern neotectonic zone, {{and south of the}} northern neotectonic belt. The three above mentioned neotectonic belts (southern, eastern and northern) were chosen for this study, each one with its own characteristics. This study aims at characterizing and targeting potentially high yield aquifers in the neotectonic zones in the Eastern Cape Province. The methods used in this study include: 1) A comprehensive literature review on neotectonics in South Africa in general and in the Eastern Cape Province in particular; 2) Extraction of lineaments through remote sensing and examination of digital elevation models; 3) Examination of seismic data for the subsurface visualization onshore and offshore; 4) Study on the genesis of the Grahamstown kaolin deposits through the structural component; and 5) Acquisition and interpretation of magnetic, electromagnetic and radiometric data from three of the hot springs in the northern neotectonic belt. The results indicate the following: 1) Old map of seismic epicentres in South Africa need to be reviewed continually. The Eastern Cape was regarded as quiescent in terms of seismicity. However, the investigation from recent seismic epicenters downloadable from the IRIS website has shown that recent seismic events occurred in the Eastern Cape Province especially in the northern and southern neotectonic belts. The central part located north of the southern neotectonic belt and south of the northern neotectonic belt is inactive. This inactive zone can be considered for the storage of nuclear wastes. 2) The eastern neotectonic belt has, like the northern neotectonic belt, a higher density of lineaments oriented northwest-southeast, which makes it the second important neotectonic belt. These lineaments correlate with the normalized difference vegetation index indicative of a good circulation of groundwater. In the south, the Eastern Cape great lineament oriented east-west is now considered a neotectonic domain because many seismic epicentres occur therein. Its geomorphologic shape in graben type form is a favourable structure for groundwater catchment. The surface topography is not uniform and high elevations in the east are related to the uplift {{that took place in the}} Quaternary. Most vector gradients are oriented east-west, a fact to be reckon with in the study of surface water flow and aquifers characterization. 3) Offshore along the east coast, the subsurface is affected by neotectonic faults, which are probably splays of the Agulhas Falkland Fractured Zone (AFFZ). The folds that occur are related to the regional compressional stress known as the Wegener Stress Anomaly (WSM). On land, straight lines from seismic profiles indicate that weathering occurs in consolidated materials probably along faults or fractures, unconsolidated sediments always have wavy profiles. On the other hand, field observations in King Williams Town have clearly shown that a tectonic uplift took place on a dolerite sill overlain by mudstones and sandstones. The uplift is possibly related to the Amatole-Swaziland event that occurred in the last five millions years. The escarpment along this dolerite sill overlain by sedimentary rocks is a meso-scale fault with a dip-slip component. Healthy vegetation and a river flowing parallel to the cliff indicate groundwater flow in the zone of weakness. 4) In the southern neotectonic belt there is a clear northwest-southeast horizontal compression and a southwest-northeast vertical to sub-vertical extension. Enrichment of granitic breccias and feldspar in the Grahamstown Dwyka tillite is the source for the formation of kaolin deposits. The weathering starts in the granitic breccias through their extensional fractures and then extends in the matrix, which has micro-fractures that are only visible with the transmitted microscope. Combined extensional strike-slip and dip-slip faulting is responsible for the earthquakes in the region of Grahamstown where the kaolin is formed. There is also an unreported thermal (quartz veins) and neotectonic event identified in this region. 5) The hot springs in the northern neotectonic belt are connected by a regional neotectonic fault. The use of magnetic and electromagnetic methods helped to decipher the occurrence of faults, fractures, dolerite dykes, and variable degree of weathering. Uranium/potassium ratios derived from radiometric surveys show that areas around some hot springs are characterized by enrichment in uranium. High concentrations of thorium are related to its low capacity of being easily dissolved in water. It can be concluded that seismicity, hot springs and accordingly deep groundwater circulation, high density of lineaments, quaternary tectonic uplift, are the predominate characteristics of the three neotectonic zones. Furthermore, on the environmental point of view, thorium concentration is higher than that of either uranium or potassium. Although it is nonetheless below the world average threshold of 7. 4 ppm according to United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), it may be a source of radiation hazard to humans and animals if they are subjected to prolonged exposure. All the neotectonic zones in the Eastern Cape Province present potentials to host good and important aquifers. It is suggested that the Eastern Cape great lineament in the southern neotectonic belt and the Kokstad-Koffiefontein seismic belt in the northern neotectonic belt, be monitored for future research regarding, neotectonics, seismic risk assessment and hydrogeology.
