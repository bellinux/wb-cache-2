25|$|To {{cope with}} the {{increased}} size and armor of the vehicle, a more powerful 400hp Detroit Diesel 6V53TIA turbocharged/aftercooled diesel engine is installed {{in place of the}} original 275hp engine on the M113, giving a power-to-weight ratio of 20hp/ton. This is coupled to an Allison X200 cross-drive, four-speed <b>Hydrokinetic</b> <b>transmission.</b> As a result of the longer chassis and improved engine a sixth road wheel is added (the M113 only has five). As an option the vehicle can be of 350hp only. The modifications allows the EIFV to keep up in terms of speed and mobility with modern tanks such as the M1A1/A2 Abrams, which are used by the Egyptian Army, despite the added weight. The vehicle can travers slopes up to 80%, side slopes of 40%, trenches 2200mm wide, and vertical obstacles with a height of 710mm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrokinetic</b> <b>transmission</b> (also called {{hydrodynamic}} transmission) uses a {{torque converter}}. A torque converter {{consists of three}} main parts, two of which rotate, and one (the stator) that has a lock preventing backwards rotation and adding output torque by redirecting the oil flow at low output RPM. All three main parts are sealed in an oil-filled housing. To match engine speed to load speed over the entire speed range of a locomotive some additional method is required to give sufficient range. One method is to follow the torque converter with a mechanical gearbox which switches ratios automatically, similar to an automatic transmission on a car. Another method is to provide several torque converters each {{with a range of}} variability covering part of the total required; all the torque converters are mechanically connected all the time, and the appropriate one for the speed range required is selected by filling it with oil and draining the others. The filling and draining is carried out with the transmission under load, and results in very smooth range changes with no break in the transmitted power.|$|E

5000|$|The Saeby≈èl-class {{locomotives}} have a centrecab body design, with a full-width cab {{offset from}} the centre towards {{the rear of}} the locomotive and external walkways along the engine compartment hoods, and are slightly larger than the Red Flag-class shunters. They are powered by a [...] diesel engine with a <b>hydrokinetic</b> <b>transmission,</b> and have a Bo-Bo wheel arrangement.|$|E
