50|$|Artiodactyls are {{generally}} quadrupeds. Two major body types are known: Suinas and hippopotamuses {{are characterized by}} a stocky body, short legs, and a large head; camels and ruminants, though, have a more slender build and lanky legs. Size varies considerably; the smallest member, the mouse deer, often reaches a body length of only 45 cm and a weight of 1.5 kg. The largest member, the hippopotamus, can grow up to 5 m in length and weigh 4.5 MT, and the giraffe can grow to be 5.5 m tall and 4.7 m in body length. All even-toed ungulates display some form of sexual dimorphism: the males are consistently larger and heavier than the females. In deer, only the males boast antlers, and the horns of bovines are usually small or not present in females. Male <b>Indian</b> <b>antelopes</b> have a much darker coat than females.|$|R

40|$|Eighteen field plots at 15 {{locations}} {{were selected}} {{throughout the state}} to evaluate {{the status of the}} boron content in irrigation waters, soils, and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) plant tissue under irrigated conditions. No boron deficiency symptoms were observed in any of the alfalfa plants at any of these locations, nor were any of the plant tissue boron levels inadequate. Only two locations were found in which the alfalfa plants exibited toxicity symptoms. These locations were along the <b>Indian</b> and <b>Antelope</b> Creeks in Duchesne County which contain high boron levels in the water. All the alfalfa and soil tested and irrigated by either <b>Indian</b> or <b>Antelope</b> Creek waters are the only ones tested and found to contain, naturally occuring, high levels of boron in Utah. The light sandy soils were found to contain less available boron than the heavier clay soils. The sandy soil of the Grand County location at Moab showed no available soil boron, while the clayey soils in Duchesne County irrigated with high boron waters were the only soils found to contain excessive levels of available soil boron. The application of 2. 8 kilograms of boron per hectare in the form of Solubor significantly increased the available soil boron content by 19. 07 percent in the Cache County plots. The 12 alfalfa varieties grown in the Morgan and Tooele County plots showed significant differences with respect to location and tissue boron contents when the results of the two locations were combined. Overall, variety desert had the highest average boron content of 69. 5 milligrams boron per kilogram and AS- 49 R contained the lowest boron content (Y= 69. 91 + 13. 64 X; R 2 = 0. 79) or the available soil boron content (Y= 63. 15 + 7. 66 X; R 2 = 0. 82) ...|$|R

5000|$|.....is in low, isolated, rocky hills, {{near the}} plains on which live antelopes, its {{principal}} prey. It also kills gazelles, nilgai, and, doubtless, occasionally deer and other animals. Instances also occur of {{sheep and goats}} being carried off by it, but it rarely molests domestic animals, {{and has not been}} known to attack men. Its mode of capturing its prey is to stalk up to within a moderate distance of between one to two hundred yards, taking advantage of inequalities of the ground, bushes, or other cover, and then to make a rush. Its speed for a short distance is remarkable far exceeding that of any other beast of prey, even of a greyhound or kangaroo-hound, for no dog can at first overtake an <b>Indian</b> <b>antelope</b> or a gazelle, either of which is quickly run down by C. jubatus, if the start does not exceed about two hundred yards. General McMaster saw a very fine hunting-leopard catch a black buck that had about that start within four hundred yards.

40|$|We studied {{variation}} in lekking costs in an <b>Indian</b> <b>antelope,</b> the blackbuck Antilope cervi-capra, {{in relation to}} female mating patterns. We tested the hypothesis that central males had a higher mating success and faced higher costs than peripheral males. We used continuous focal animal sampling to estimate time-activitybudgets of individually identi ed central and peripheral lekking males and bachelor males. Scan sampling was used to estimate the time spent on the lek by central and peripheral males and to monitor female visits to the lek. We mapped lek-territories and monitored territory additions, territory turnover, {{and the location of}} matings. We found that central males faced higher costs than peripheral males. Central males foraged less, spent more time on the lek and tended to have higher ghting rates than peripheralmales. Corresponding to this difference in costs, mating bene ts were also greater for central males. Our results suggest that lek-territory location may be an important cue in female choice. Male mating success was skewed and 90 % of matings observed occurred in the lek-centre. Furthermore, three of the ve most successfulmales previouslyheld territories in the lek-periphery where they were not observed to mate. Territory turnover was higher in the centre than in the periphery and males tended to move towards the centre while shifting territories. Based on these ndings, we suggest that central and peripheral males follow two different strategies in response to a female preference for central territories: while central males may try to maximise encounterswith oestrous females by investing heavily in lekking...|$|E
40|$|The main {{ecological}} {{factors that are}} hypothesized to explain the striking variation {{in the size of}} social groups among large herbivores are habitat structure, predation, and forage abundance and distribution; however, their relative roles in wild populations are not well understood. I combined analyses of ecological correlates of spatial variation in group size with analyses of individual behaviour in groups of different sizes to investigate factors maintaining variation in group size in an <b>Indian</b> <b>antelope,</b> the blackbuck Antilope cervicapra. I measured group size, habitat structure, forage, and the occurrence of predators in ten blackbuck populations, and, at a smaller spatial scale, within an intensively studied population. To examine the processes by which these {{ecological factors}} influence group size, I used behavioural observations and an experiment to estimate the shape of the relationship between group size and potential costs and benefits to individuals. Group size varied extensively both among and within populations. Analyses of spatial variation in group size suggested that both forage and habitat structure influence group size: large-scale, among-population variation in group size was primarily related to habitat structure, while small-scale, within-population variation was most closely related to forage abundance. Analyses of individual behaviour suggested that larger groups incur greater travel costs while foraging. However, individuals in larger groups appeared to experience greater benefits, namely the earlier detection of a "predator", a reduction in vigilance, and an increase in the time spent feeding. Overall, these findings suggest that individuals in groups experience a trade-off between predation-related benefits and costs arising from feeding competition. Habitat structure and forage likely influence the nature of this trade-off; thus, variation in these ecological factors may maintain variation in group size. The role of predation pressure and other factors in explaining the remaining variation needs further exploration...|$|E

50|$|Until recent history, {{the open}} grasslands of the Indus-Ganga Plain were {{inhabited}} by several large species of animal. The open plains were home to {{large numbers of}} herbivores which included {{all three of the}} Asian rhinoceros (Indian rhinoceros, Javan rhinoceros, Sumatran rhinoceros). The open grasslands were in many ways similar to the landscape of modern Africa. Gazelle, buffalo, rhinos, elephants, lions, and hippo roamed the grasslands as they do in Africa today. Large herds of <b>Indian</b> elephants, gazelles, <b>antelopes</b> and horses lived alongside several species of wild cattle including the now-extinct aurochs. In the forested areas there were several species of wild pig, deer and muntjac. In the wetter regions close to the Ganga, there would have been large herds of water buffalo grazing on the riverbanks along with extinct species of hippopotamus.|$|R

The park has 55 mammals, including barking deer, Bengal tiger, common langur, four-horned <b>antelope,</b> <b>Indian</b> bison, Indian elephant, Indian giant squirrel, Indian leopard, jungle cat, sambar deer, and wild boar. There are 304 species of birds in the park, such as the common hill myna, grey hornbill, Indian pied hornbill and Malabar pied hornbill. It also has 60 species of reptiles, notable among which are the king cobra and tricarinate hill turtle. There is also a mugger crocodile breeding program in nearby Ramtirtha.The Chandaka Elephant Sanctuary is a 190 km2 protected area near the capital city, Bhubaneswar. However, urban expansion and over-grazing have reduced the forests and are driving herds of elephants to migration. In 2002, there were about 80 elephants. But by 2012, their numbers had been reduced to 20. Many of the animals have migrated toward the Barbara reserve forest, Chilika, Nayagarh district, and Athagad. Some elephants have died in conflicts with villagers, while some have died during migration from being electrocuted by power lines or hit by trains. Outside the protected area, they are killed by poachers. Besides elephants, the sanctuary also has Indian leopards, jungle cats and chitals.|$|R
