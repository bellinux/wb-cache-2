50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>slab</b> {{subduction}} {{is characterized}} by a low subduction angle (<30 degrees to horizontal) beyond the seismogenic zone and a resumption of normal subduction far from the trench. A slab is slang for the subducting lower plate. Although, some would characterize <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> subduction as any shallowly dipping lower plate as in western Mexico. <b>Flat</b> <b>slab</b> subduction is associated with the pinching out of the asthenosphere, an inland migration of arc magmatism (magmatic sweep), and an eventual cessation of arc magmatism. The coupling of the <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> to the upper plate is thought to change the style of deformation occurring on the upper plate's surface and form basement-cored uplifts like the Rocky Mountains. The <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> also may hydrate the lower continental lithosphere and be involved in the formation of economically important ore deposits. During the subduction, a <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> itself may be deformed, or buckling, causing sedimentary hiatus in marine sediments on the slab. The failure of a <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> is associated with ignimbritic volcanism and the reverse migration of arc volcanism. Multiple working hypotheses about the cause of <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> are subduction of thick, buoyant oceanic crust (15-20 km) and trench rollback accompanying a rapidly overriding upper plate and enhanced trench suction. The west coast of South America has two of the largest <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> subduction zones. <b>Flat</b> <b>slab</b> subduction is occurring at 10% of subduction zones.|$|R

50|$|The {{subduction}} of bathymetric highs such as aseismic ridges, oceanic plateaus, and seamounts {{has been}} posited {{as the primary}} driver of <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> subduction. The Andean <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> subduction zones, the Peruvian slab and the Pampean (Chilean) <b>flat</b> <b>slab,</b> are spatially correlated with the subduction of bathymetric highs, the Nazca Ridge and the Juan Fernandéz Ridge, respectively. The thick, buoyant oceanic crust lowers {{the density of the}} slab, and the slab fails to sink into the mantle after coming to a shallow depth (~100 km) due the lessened density contrast. This is supported by the fact that all slabs under ~50 Ma. However, there are cases where aseismic ridges on the same scale as the Nazca Ridge are subducting normally, and cases where <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> are not associated with bathymetric highs. There are few <b>flat</b> <b>slabs</b> in the Western Pacific in areas associated with the subduction of bathymetric highs.

We investigate the dynamics and interaction of the Nazca Ridge and the <b>flat</b> <b>slab</b> system by studying upper mantle seismic anisotropy across southern Peru. We analyze shear wave splitting of SKS, sSKS, and PKS phases at 49 stations distributed across the area, primarily from the PerU Lithosphere and Slab Experiment (PULSE). We observe distinct spatial variations in anisotropic structure along strike, most notably a sharp transition from coherent splitting in the north to pervasive null (non-split) arrivals in the south, with the transition coinciding with the northern limit of the Nazca Ridge. For both anisotropic domains there is evidence for complex and multi-layered anisotropy. To the north of the ridge our View the MathML sourceKS? splitting measurements likely reflect trench-normal mantle flow beneath the <b>flat</b> <b>slab.</b> This signal is then modified by shallower anisotropic layers, most likely in the supra-slab mantle, but also potentially from within the slab.
