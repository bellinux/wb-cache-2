2500|$|The {{presence}} or absence of liability may hang on a <b>foreseeability</b> <b>test.</b> The fact that the consumption of alcohol or the ingestion of drugs may cause a loss of control is well known. Thus, anyone who knowingly consumes is, at the very least, reckless as to the possibility of losing control. If they did not wish to lose control, they would not consume, so loss of control must be within the scope of their intention by continuing to consume. But, loss of control is not instantaneous and without symptoms. The issue of involuntary consumption is therefore contentious. In most legal systems, involuntary loss of control is limited to cases where there is no real loss of control with noticeable symptoms. Thus, for example, in many states, the blood alcohol level for the commission of the offence of driving under the influence is set sufficiently low that people might exceed the limit without realising that they had consumed enough alcohol to do so. Leaving aside the issue that, in some states, this is a strict liability offense excluding drunkenness as a defense, there is usually a requirement that the person who [...] "spiked" [...] the drinks be prosecuted in place of the driver. This reflects the fact that the commission of a crime has been procured by the actions of secretly adding the alcohol and the practical fact that without this rule, too many accused who are only marginally over the limit, might be encouraged to blame others for their intoxication.|$|E

40|$|Causation has, at {{the very}} minimum, two {{functions}} in legal responsibility regimes. First, there is no responsibility without a conduct with causal consequences, making causation a condition of responsibility. Second, causation determines and delimits the extent of liability. The first claim {{of this study is}} that the decision of the International Law Commission to construct a responsibility regime unconditional on damage did not result in the exclusion of causation from the conditions of responsibility. There are at least two signs demonstrating that the attempt to exclude responsibility-grounding causation from State responsibility did not hold ground in practice. First, there is abundant case law pre- and postdating the codification of the Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA), confirming that responsibility-grounding causation exists in international law. Second, notwithstanding the denial of ARSIWA and its commentaries, reading between the lines reveals that several concepts of State responsibility are of a causal nature and their application inevitably implies a causal inquiry. There are two interrelated explanations for this. First, at the heart of the system of State responsibility lies the concept of the ‘internationally wrongful act’. I argue that the law of State responsibility lacks a coherent action theory. In particular, a causal theory of action would explain several anomalies visible in the case law. The second explanation rests on approaching causation in the law of international responsibility as a general principle of law. The prevailing view in the case law and the academic contributions is that causation and, more specifically, certain standards of causation are general principles of law. In making the second claim of this thesis, I will argue that this is only partially true. Causation is a general principle in as much as the existence of a causal link is a condition of responsibility and one possible condition of delimiting liability. ARSIWA therefore runs contrary to this general principle. However, the authorities arguing for a specific test of causation, be it directness, proximity, <b>foreseeability</b> or other <b>tests,</b> do not have a substantial basis to do so. What remains, as an empirical and inductive method in line with Article 38 (1) d) of the ICJ Statute, is to distil the actual practice of international courts and tribunals. My third claim is that there is merit in this exercise and it is possible to identify recurring solutions to recurring problems of causation. This study is the second one to conduct this survey and analysis of the case law, following the footsteps of Brigitte Stern, updating and complementing her otherwise exhaustive and authoritative text on the subject. The thesis concludes with a list of the distilled principles and postulates on respective problems of causation, in particular on the applicability and the limits of the ‘but for’ test, the applicable standard of remoteness, multiple causation and contributory negligence.

50|$|The Wagon Mound (No 1) test is less {{generous to}} claimants than the direct {{consequence}} test {{because it may}} impose an artificial limit {{on the extent of}} damages that can be claimed. To mitigate some of the potential unfairness of the rule, the courts have been inclined to take a relatively liberal view of whether damage is of a foreseeable type. In Lamb v. London Borough of Camden a water main maintained by the Council broke, which caused extensive damage to the claimant's house. Because of the damage, the claimant moved out and squatters moved in, causing further damage to the house. The court held that the secondary damage caused by the squatters was too remote. The council was liable for the damage caused by the broken water main, but the land owner is responsible for keeping trespassers at bay. Lord Denning said at p636 that remoteness of damages is just a question of policy with the element of foreseeability being determined by what is perceived to be instinctively just. This means that the reasonable <b>foreseeability</b> <b>test</b> is not always appropriate for cases where the acts of the claimant may demonstrate some fault. Nevertheless, the courts can award damages based on foreseeability where public policy requires it, e.g. in the egg-shell skull cases such as Smith v Leech Brain & Co.|$|E

40|$|This note {{discusses}} a 2008 House of Lords {{decision on}} the proper test for remoteness of contractual damages following a breach of contract. In The Achilleas, Lord Hoffmann set out a test for remoteness which varied slightly from the traditional Hadley v Baxendale test of foreseeability entrenched in Common Law countries world-wide. Lord Hoffmann’s test draws on the broader context of an agreement, including {{whether there was a}} tacit assumption of risk by one of the parties, as well as standard norms in the industry in question. Although the Court was not unanimous in The Achilleas, this represents a significant departure from settled law. In South Africa, our Supreme Court of Appeal has favoured a ‘contemplation’ (<b>foreseeability)</b> <b>test</b> over a ‘convention’ (assumption of risk) one. In an important decision in 2001, however, this Court gave an obiter indication that it may also in future revise our <b>foreseeability</b> <b>test</b> in favour of a more flexible one, in line with other branches of the law of obligations. Lord Hoffmann’s decision is thus of relevance in demonstrating comparative trends in development of the law of remoteness of damage...|$|E

Engaging particularly with the application of the Arbitration Tribunal of the abuse of rights doctrine, the note addresses, in the light of this award, a series of questions that continue to perplex international investment lawyers. How should the concept of abuse of rights be defined? What is the status of the abuse of rights doctrine in international law? What is the relationship between the abuse of rights doctrine and the <b>foreseeability</b> <b>test?</b> What is the significance of the demonstration of bad faith on the part of an investor for the application of the abuse of rights doctrine?...|$|E
40|$|This article {{traces the}} {{development}} of the <b>foreseeability</b> <b>test</b> {{in the context of the}} nullum crimen principle. While the European Court of Human Rights has introduced the ‘accessibility and foreseeability’ criteria long ago in the Sunday Times case, the Court has only recently started to apply this standard with respect to international crimes. In the Kononov case, judges of the European Court of Human Rights exhibited strongly divergent opinions on the question whether the punishment of alleged war crimes that had been committed in 1944 violated the nullum crimen principle. According to this author, the dissension of the judges demonstrates the lack of objective foreseeability, which should have served as a starting point for the assessment of the subjective foreseeability and a - potentially exculpating - mistake of law of the perpetrator. The Court should therefore have concluded that the nullum crimen principle had been violated...|$|E
40|$|American {{courts have}} long {{struggled}} with categorizing municipalities. They treat municipalities sometimes as private corporations, sometimes as governmental bodies, and sometimes as something in between. This uncertainty provides a shaky foundation for local government law and hampers its development. Local governments {{are not sure}} of their powers, and states are unable to create a comprehensive vision of municipal governance. When federal law is involved, the situation is muddled further. In FTC v. Phoebe Putney, the Supreme Court’s application of the state action doctrine unnecessarily injected federal antitrust law into the relationship between states and municipalities. The state action doctrine exempts states from antitrust liability and is only sometimes applicable to municipalities. Though ostensibly applying a “foreseeability” test {{to determine whether a}} municipality benefits from the doctrine, the Supreme Court instead pigeonholed municipal power into a narrow conception of municipalities’ role in American governance. This narrowed <b>foreseeability</b> <b>test</b> not only on its face constricts states’ ability to delegate certain functions to municipalities, but also creates constraining uncertainty as to which delegations of state power to municipalities will run afoul of federal antitrust law. Accordingly, this Note analyzes Phoebe Putney as an erosion of municipalities’ ability to perform governmental functions—to promote the health, safety, and welfare of the community—and as denying municipalities a vibrant role in the American federal system...|$|E
