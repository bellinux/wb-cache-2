5000|$|In the 1930s and 1940s {{the demand}} in Europe for reed organs and {{harmoniums}} significantly declined and the factory started exporting the reeds to India where Indian style hand-pumped harmoniums had become very popular creating the demand and {{a market for}} the German Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch reeds. Although these organ reeds were originally designed and manufactured for American style suction organs they became the favored reeds for their tone quality and tuning stability in Indian hand pumped harmoniums which work on an air pressure system. In {{order for them to}} be attached to the Indian <b>harmonium</b> <b>reed</b> board (as opposed to sliding into the reed chambers as they did on the reed organs) holes were drilled at the top tongue end of the reed casing and a notch was drilled at the base end. This enabled the Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch reeds to be screwed directly and tightly onto the reed board with the reed tongue over the air holes connected to the playing keys. Subsequently, the factory began selling the reed sets labeled as Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch Harmonium Brass Reeds Made in Germany with the screw holes already drilled in the outer reed casing to suit the Indian harmonium market. The distinguishing visual features of the German Jubilate reeds are the words Jubilate, Harmola or Monarch and Made in Germany which are stamped on each individual reed in addition to the pitch of the reed and the distinct rounded bottom edge of the casing at the tongue end of the reed. There were also German reeds that were stamped with only [...] "Made in Germany" [...] and some were stamped only with the note/pitch of the reed. The latter version with the note/pitch stamp only can be identified by the distinct rivet structure securing the reed tongue on the German reeds which is the same on all versions of these reeds made on the same machinery in Germany. Most of the German reeds used in the Indian style harmoniums do not have the typical reed tongue shaping for the voicing of the reeds found in American or German style suction organs.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the factory making the Jublilate/Harmola/Monarch organ reeds, having changed hands {{several times and}} now {{situated}} in post World War II East Germany (GDR), {{was taken over by}} the communist government and the reed making machinery was destroyed. This marked the end of German reed production. In the late 1970s India had also issued a ban on the importing of any German Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch <b>Harmonium</b> <b>reeds</b> to boost sales and promote the production of <b>harmonium</b> <b>reeds</b> now being made in India. As a result, the demand and the value of the reeds increased as did the scarcity of availability although they were still exported to Pakistan which was not using Indian <b>harmonium</b> <b>reeds</b> because or trade restrictions between the two countries. Today German Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch reeds are highly prized and sought after by players of Indian harmoniums in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh as well as around the globe.|$|R

50|$|German Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch <b>Harmonium</b> <b>Reeds</b> are brass reeds used in Indian {{harmoniums}} {{that were}} manufactured in Germany between 1911 {{and the early}} 1960s. The Jubilate/Harmola/Monarch reeds were originally manufactured for American style suction reed organs being manufactured in Germany on machinery that was bought second hand in Chicago in the United States and imported to Germany by Karl Mannborg son of Theodor Mannborg. Mannborg owned the factory in Pegau, Germany supplying organ parts for American style suction reed organs.

During 1932 to 1937 he developed an instrument related to the organ which used <b>harmonium</b> <b>reeds.</b> The instrument was demonstrated in the Church of St Odile in Paris in July 1939.|$|R

50|$|There are {{two types}} of free reeds: framed and unframed. Framed free reeds are used on ancient Asian {{instruments}} such as the Chinese shēng, Japanese shō, and Laotian khene, and modern European instruments such as the <b>harmonium</b> or <b>reed</b> organ (consisting of reed pipes), harmonica, concertina, bandoneón, accordion, and Russian bayan. The reed is made from cane, willow, brass or steel, and is enclosed in a rigid frame. The pitch of the framed free reed is fixed.|$|R
2500|$|Accordions (from 19th century German Akkordeon, from Akkord—"musical chord, concord of sounds") are {{a family}} of {{box-shaped}} musical instruments of the bellows-driven free-reed aerophone type, colloquially {{referred to as a}} squeezebox. A person who plays the accordion is called an accordionist. [...] The concertina and bandoneón are related; the <b>harmonium</b> and American <b>reed</b> organ are in the same family.|$|R
50|$|The {{immediate}} predecessor of {{the electronic}} organ was the <b>harmonium,</b> or <b>reed</b> organ, an instrument that was very popular in homes and small churches in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In a fashion not totally unlike that of pipe organs, reed organs generated sound by forcing air over a set of reeds {{by means of a}} bellows, usually operated by constantly pumping a set of pedals. While reed organs had limited tonal quality, they were small, inexpensive, self-powered, and self-contained. The reed organ was thus able to bring an organlike sound to venues that were incapable of housing or affording pipe organs. This concept was {{to play an important role}} in the development of the electric organ.|$|R
5000|$|... "Tremolo" [...] is {{most often}} defined as a {{periodic}} change of volume (sometimes incorrectly defined as a change in pitch, strictly vibrato). Most orchestral instruments achieve this effect by repeated playing of a single note. The tremolo harmonica achieves the effect by employing the physical phenomenon called beats. Each note is played simultaneously by two reeds, fractionally out of tune with each other. The resulting sound is of constant pitch but the volume oscillates between loud and quiet. This effect is fairly common amongst Western free-reed instruments and is found in accordions, <b>harmoniums</b> and <b>reed</b> organs under various names (celeste, vox jubilante, etc.), {{but it is also}} used, for example, on the piano, where each of the three strings is tuned very slightly sharper or flatter, giving a richer sound to the instrument.|$|R
50|$|Carl Eitz {{was the son}} of a gardener, and showed, in {{particular}} areas of math and physics whiz. Under difficult conditions, he became a teacher. From 1870 to 1872 he was organist and teacher in Dalldorf, and then work over many years as a teacher at the Second Eisleber public school, where he also worked as a scientist. So he invented the Tonwortsystem sound, wort: word (Latonisation), which found application in all schools in Germany, and the pure <b>harmonium,</b> a <b>reed</b> organ with a mathematically pure sentiment. As acoustician and music educator, he his influence was recognized among scientific figures of his time such as Max Planck and Hermann von Helmholtz. Since 1918, full professor, his achievements in musical acoustics were honored in 1922 by the award of Honorary Doctor of the University of Kiel. The Prussian Ministry of Culture awarded him an honorary doctorate.|$|R
5000|$|The {{acoustical}} effects {{described below}} {{are a result}} of the free-reed mechanism. Therefore, they are essentially identical for the Western and Indian <b>harmoniums</b> and the <b>reed</b> organ. In 1875, Hermann von Helmholtz published his seminal book, On the Sensations of Tone, in which he used the harmonium extensively to test different tuning systems:"Among musical instruments, the harmonium, on account of its uniformly sustained tone, the piercing character of its quality of tone, and its tolerably distinct combinational tones, is particularly sensitive to inaccuracies of intonation. And as its vibrators also admit of a delicate and durable tuning, it appeared to me peculiarly suitable for experiments on a more perfect system of tones." ...|$|R
