While acknowledging that a number of wider regional or trans-continental issues that involve Central Asia are also of concern to the EU, he argues in this CEPS Commentary that they should be seen in a much wider context. In his view, these are essentially EurAsian issues, with important long-term implications for the EU’s relations with Russia, China and India. He concludes that {{it is more important to}} devise a concept of an 'extroverted regionalism' for Central Asia, which would 'disenclave' this landlocked territory and open up different <b>external</b> <b>options</b> for each state...|$|R

Potentials for trade expansion between China and Malaysia, estimated through a three-dimensional panel gravity model, are found to be marginally lower under the RCEP structure relative to ASEAN.

This suggests a change (decline) in the trade posture of the China-Malaysia partnership as relative advantages {{are most likely to be}} altered under the expanded matrix of Chinese relations with RCEP members. In coping with the larger matrix structure, both nations should innovate new forms of bilateral cooperation, beyond trade, to enhance their strategic partnership...|$|R
