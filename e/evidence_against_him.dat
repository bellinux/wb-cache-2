5|$|In November 1888, he {{lost his}} post at the school for reasons that remain unclear. One month later his body was {{discovered}} drowned in the River Thames. His death, which {{was found to be}} a suicide, roughly coincided {{with the end of the}} murders attributed to Jack the Ripper. Private suggestions in the 1890s that he could have committed the crimes became public knowledge in the 1960s, and led to the publication of books that proposed him as the murderer. The <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> was entirely circumstantial, however, and many writers from the 1970s onwards have rejected him as a likely suspect.|$|E
5|$|Portland, Oregon police {{officers}} searched {{the home of}} James Butler Elkins, ostensibly for obscene material, and seized tape recordings that Elkins had made from illegal wiretaps. He was subsequently convicted in federal court of intercepting and divulging telephone communications, but appealed his federal conviction {{on the grounds that}} state police had gathered the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights. His conviction was upheld by the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals.|$|E
5|$|According to Oleg Gordievsky, {{the highest-ranking}} KGB officer ever to defect, and Pavel Sudoplatov, the former deputy {{director}} of Foreign Intelligence for the Soviet Union, Pontecorvo was a Soviet spy. However, Sudoplatov misidentified Pontecorvo as the spy codenamed Mlad, whom we now know was Ted Hall. While Pontecorvo always denied working on nuclear weapons, in Canada, Britain or the Soviet Union, he never confirmed or denied {{that he was a}} spy. The actual <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> was flimsy. Frank Close noted that the blueprints of the Canadian NRX reactor had {{made their way to the}} Soviet Union, and Lona Cohen obtained a sample of uranium from the NRX after it started operation in 1947. Nunn May could not have been the culprit, so Pontecorvo is the prime suspect.|$|E

5|$|Born {{and raised}} in east Moscow, Streltsov joined Torpedo {{at the age of}} 16 in 1953 and made his {{international}} debut two years later. He was part of the squad that won the gold medal at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, and came seventh in the 1957 Ballon d'Or. Early the next year his promising career was interrupted by a rape scandal. The 20-year-old Streltsov was accused of raping a woman shortly before the 1958 World Cup; told he could still play if he admitted his guilt, he confessed, despite inconclusive <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> He was instead convicted and sentenced to twelve years in the Gulag system of forced labour camps.|$|E
5|$|John Rowan (July 12, 1773July 13, 1843) was a 19th-century {{politician}} and jurist from the U.S. state of Kentucky. Rowan's family moved from Pennsylvania to the Kentucky frontier {{when he was}} young. From there, they moved to Bardstown, Kentucky, where Rowan studied law with former Kentucky Attorney General George Nicholas. He was a representative to the state constitutional convention of 1799, but his promising political career was almost derailed when he killed {{a man in a}} duel stemming from a drunken dispute during a game of cards. Although public sentiment was against him, a judge found insufficient <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> to convict him of murder. In 1804, Governor Christopher Greenup appointed Rowan Secretary of State, and he went on to serve in the Kentucky House of Representatives and the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Keith ends his {{relationship}} with Wallace's mother Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel) to give Lianne a second chance. Because Celeste refused to pay the $50,000 reward for finding Duncan, Keith sues the Kanes, who agree to pay if Veronica signs away any future claim to their estate. Once Veronica signs, Keith shows her the DNA test that proves he is her father, meaning Veronica never had a claim of the estate. Logan is arrested, and once released he angrily breaks up with Veronica for providing the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> Logan then explains that when he saw Lilly after returning from Mexico, he knew their relationship was over and wrote a letter which he left in her car.|$|E
25|$|Paoli {{was arrested}} and accused of violating the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law). The <b>evidence</b> used <b>against</b> <b>him</b> was the Puerto Rican Flag in his residence, and four speeches he had given in favor of Puerto Rican independence.|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 2015, {{a federal}} judge from the State of Mexico ordered Castillo Rodríguez's release after {{concluding}} that the <b>evidences</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> were insufficient and that his due process was violated {{at the moment of}} his arrest and after he was in custody. The judge stated that when he was arrested in June, the officers did not have an arrest warrant <b>against</b> <b>him</b> and entered the private property without legal authorization. He also stated that the detainee was in custody for 9 hours and without a lawyer before he was sent to the justice department. When the judge considered that authorities had failed to prove that he was involved in organized crime, he was released from prison.|$|R

5|$|Mercator was apprehended in Rupelmonde {{and imprisoned}} in the castle. He {{was accused of}} {{suspicious}} correspondence with the Franciscan friars in Mechelen but no incriminating writings were uncovered in his home or at the friary in Mechelen. At the same time his well placed friends petitioned on his behalf, but whether his friend Antoine Perronet was helpful is unknown: Perronet, as a bishop, would have to support {{the activities of the}} Inquisition. After seven months Mercator was released for lack of <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.|$|E
5|$|Morrow {{opened his}} {{practice}} in Lexington. He established his reputation {{in one of}} his first casesthe trial of William Moseby, a black man accused of murder. Moseby's first trial had ended in a hung jury, but because the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> included a confession (which he later recanted), most observers believed he would be convicted in his second trial. Unable to find a defense lawyer for Moseby, the judge in the case turned to Morrow, who as a young lawyer was eager for work. Morrow proved that his client's testimony had been extorted; he had been told that a lynch mob waited outside the jail for him, but no such mob had ever existed. Morrow further showed that other testimony against his client was false. Moseby was acquitted September 21, 1902.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{great deal}} of {{controversy}} surrounding the case. Gordon received much support from his family and friends and maintained his innocence. There was a large amount of local interest in the trial as shown by the sales of the local paper, the North-West Evening Mail. Some claimed that much of the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> could be discounted and there were vigils and petitions in attempts to free Gordon from prison and clear his name. The case featured prominently in the book No Smoke: The Shocking Truth About British Justice which outlined seven cases the author believed to be examples of innocent people being convicted of murder.|$|E

5|$|Detective Harold Greer is {{initially}} {{in charge of}} the murder investigation, but Rusty has him replaced with his friend Detective Dan Lipranzer, whom he persuades to narrow the inquiry so that his relationship with Carolyn is left out. Rusty soon discovers that Molto is making his own inquiries. Aspects of the crime suggest that the killer knew police evidence-gathering procedures and covered up clues accordingly. Semen found in the victim's body contains only dead sperm. The killer's blood is type A, the same as Rusty's. When Della Guardia wins the election, he and Molto accuse Rusty of the murder and push to get <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> Rusty's fingerprints are found on a beer glass from Carolyn's apartment, and fibers from his carpet at home match those found on her body. Lipranzer is removed from the case, and Greer's inquiries uncover the affair.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the County Court in Gospić {{tried and}} convicted in {{absentia}} {{a group of}} seven Croatian Serbs for their involvement in the killings of eight civilians (members of the Nikšić and Orešković families, but not the Rakić family) in Široka Kula, handing out prison sentences. Nikola Zagorac, Miroslav Serdar and Dragan Vunjak were sentenced to 20 years in prison each, while Dane Serdar, Dušan Uzelac, Milorad Barać and Dragan Uzelac each received sentences of 15 years in prison. In 1997, the County Court in Gospić also tried Vladimir Korica and Branko Banjeglav in absentia for {{taking part in the}} massacre. Both of them were convicted and sentenced to 12 years in prison. None of those convicted in absentia served any prison time. Dane Serdar voluntarily returned to Croatia in September 2003 and was granted a retrial as he had been convicted in absentia. Dane Serdar's 1994 conviction was overturned and he was acquitted in September 2004, after prosecution failed to present sufficient <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

On December 7, he was sent to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 11, a maximum-security prison in Hermosillo, Sonora. The Office of the General Prosecutor (PGR) confirmed that he was charged with drug trafficking and possession of military-exclusive firearms. A federal court in Jalisco confirmed the charges on December 15 after it concluded that the PGR provided sufficient <b>evidences</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> The court also specified that Oseguera Cervantes was found in possession of methamphetamine (1000.1 grams) with intent to distribute.|$|R

The detective {{in charge of the}} case tells Mulder that they have found David and Amy's blood on his shirt. Mulder refuses to confess to the murders, not remembering anything. Scully arrives, saying she found in Amy's blood traces of ketamine, an anesthesic substance that has hallucinogenic properties. The substance was detected in Mulder's blood as well. Meanwhile, one of the officers at the station kills himself; he has similar symptoms to that of the Cassandras. Mulder suffers a seizure and flashes back to his childhood again, witnessing his parents arguing with The Smoking Man. Scully sees Mulder the next day, telling him that she believes that the Cassandras killed themselves after receiving psychiatric treatment and that Mulder was visiting them about their alien abduction experiences.|$|E
5|$|In Ireland, the {{population}} was split into three main socio-political groups: the Gaelic Irish, who were Catholic; the Old English, who were descended from medieval Normans and were also predominantly Catholic; and the New English, who were Protestant settlers from England and Scotland aligned with the English Parliament and the Covenanters. Strafford's administration had improved the Irish economy and boosted tax revenue, but had done so by heavy-handedly imposing order. He had trained up a large Catholic army {{in support of the}} king and had weakened the authority of the Irish Parliament, while continuing to confiscate land from Catholics for Protestant settlement {{at the same time as}} promoting a Laudian Anglicanism that was anathema to Presbyterians. As a result, all three groups had become disaffected. Strafford's impeachment provided a new departure for Irish politics whereby all sides joined together to present <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> In a similar manner to the English Parliament, the Old English members of the Irish Parliament argued that while opposed to Strafford they remained loyal to Charles. They argued that the king had been led astray by malign counsellors, and that, moreover, a viceroy such as Strafford could emerge as a despotic figure instead of ensuring that the king was directly involved in governance.|$|E
5|$|When Silva {{was arrested}} in October 2012, he confessed {{to the murder of}} Martínez Pérez. Investigators and {{authorities}} in Veracruz concluded that the journalist was killed during a robbery. But when placed before a judge, Silva retracted his confession and stated that he had been tortured, held hostage for over a week, and threatened by Veracruz authorities in order to make him confess to the assassination. Silva said that officials had threatened to kill his mother, his last remaining family member. During a press conference, the Veracruz authorities relied solely on the confession of Silva as <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> None of them made references to DNA, fingerprint, or blood samples from the murder scene. Sources close to the Committee to Protect Journalists stated that the samples collected at the crime scene do not match those of any of the criminals listed on the national database. This should rule out both Silva and Domínguez (who is still at large) from the murder, because both of them have extensive criminal records. Proceso news magazine immediately took a critical stance toward the investigation and said that they did not believe that the Veracruz authorities were capable of completing a clean investigation. The Committee to Protect Journalists believes that the murder case was possibly fabricated, and that Silva was likely used as a scapegoat by the authorities. Just a few items were stolen from Martínez Pérez's house while valuable goods were left behind, so they allege that theft was not the real motive behind her murder. According to Mexican law, Proceso was allowed to participate in the investigation, so they appointed a top journalist to cover every detail of it. Proceso has complained that the Veracruz authorities have lied to them regarding possible developments in the investigation.|$|E
25|$|Nodder did {{launch an}} appeal against his sentence, contending that the <b>evidence</b> {{presented}} <b>against</b> <b>him</b> {{at his trial}} was purely circumstantial, but this appeal was dismissed on 13 December.

5000|$|At trial, the <b>evidence</b> <b>against</b> Neebe was {{particularly}} weak, as even the State's Attorney reportedly admitted.

25|$|Malherbe {{was arrested}} at a {{shopping}} center {{in the area of}} Mixcoac in Mexico City on 26 February 1997.

At the time of his arrest, he had pending accusations on conspiracy to buy, traffic, and sell cocaine and marijuana, alongside charges on homicide and illegal use of firearms under Mexican law. He was then sent to the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 1 in Almoloya de Juárez, State of Mexico to serve his sentence. Though the U.S. authorities asked for his extradition to the United States, a Mexican judge ordered Malherbe to be tried in Mexico because he believed that the <b>evidences</b> <b>against</b> <b>him</b> were insufficient.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the initial}} trial, Agrawal {{admitted}} to sharing information about SocGen's trading software with Tower {{and did not}} dispute the factual <b>evidences</b> <b>against</b> <b>him.</b> On May 13, 2010, Agrawal was charged by a district jury in a two-count indictment with violations of the Economic Espionage Act (EEA) and the National Stolen Property Act (NSPA). Agrawal violated the EEA by printing out SocGen's proprietary HFT computer code with intent of using such trade secrets for his own economic benefits. With respect to the NSPA, Agrawal [...] "unlawfully, willingly, and knowingly" [...] engaged in the interstate transportation of stolen goods by removing the HFT code from SocGen's New York offices, and taking them {{to his home in}} New Jersey.
