Various pretreatments (acidic <b>hydrolisis</b> and UV-radiation) of the filtered and unfiltered samples allow a better description of the speciattion of these elements. Six cruises covering the entire Scheldt estuary were performed between August 1987 and August 1988.. The longitudinal profile exhibits a similar trend independant of the seasonal fluctuations with a maximum in the region situated at about 60 km from the mouth, or at a salinity around 7 to 8 0 / 00. Most of the cobalt is present as dissolved inorganic species while nickel is especially present as inorganic species and adsorbed Ni on the particulate matter. A strong linear relationship between total Co and Ni as well as dissolved concentrations actually is observed in the Scheldt estuary in spite of the possible large anthropogenic perturbations of the system for these two elements...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} hydolysis efficiency of sago pith powder and fermentation efficiency by P. Stipitis CBS 5773, S. cerevisiae D 1 /P 3 GI, and Z. mobilis FNCC 0056 [...] This research was experimentally and consist of <b>hydrolisis</b> process sago pith powder and fermentation of its hydrolyzate. Sago pith powder has content 77, 5 % starch, 4, 63 % cellulose, 4, 86 % hemicelluose, lignin 3, 07 %, dan water 10, 12 %. In gelatination process in temperature at 120 °C, the yield of sugar concentration 0, 62 % and dextrose equivalent (DE) 0, 89 % obtained from the size of 100 mesh. Sago gelatine hydolized by sulfuric acid acid, I-amylase, hemicellulase, cellulase, dan amyloglukosidase produce sugar concentration 53, 28 % and DE 68, 52 %. At fermentation process in sugar concentration 5 % with content of glucose 4. 17 %, fermentation by Pichia stipitis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Zymomonas mobilis provide ethanol fermentation efficiency 23, 5 %, 37, 65 %, dan 32, 13 % respectively. At fermentation process with sugar concentration 10 % with content of glucose 8, 28 %, fermentation by Pichia stipitis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Zymomonas mobilis yielding ethanol fermentation efficiency 9, 30 %, 50, 85 % and 20, 65 % respectively...|$|E
40|$|Protein phosphatases are {{involved}} in many cellular processes. One of the most abundant and best studied members of this class is protein phosphatase type- 2 A (PP 2 A). In this study, PP 2 A was purified from the mussel Mytilus chilensis. Using both SDS-PAGE and size exclusion gel filtration under denaturant conditions, {{it was confirmed that}} the PP 2 A fraction was essentially pure. The isolated enzyme is a heterodimer and the molecular estimated masses of the subunits are 62 and 28 kDa. The isolated PP 2 A fraction has a notably high p-NPP phosphatase activity, which is inhibited by NaCl. The hydrolytic p-NPP phosphatase activity is independent of the MgCl 2 concentration. The time courses of the inhibition of the PP 2 A activity of p-NPP hydrolysis by increasing concentrations of three phycotoxins that are specific inhibitors of PP 2 A are shown. Inhibitions caused by Okadaic acid, dinophysistoxin- 1 (DTX 1, 35 -methylokadiac acid) and Microcystine L-R are dose-dependent with inhibition constants (Ki) of 1. 68, 0. 40 and 0. 27 nM respectively. Microcystine L-R, the most potent phycotoxin inhibitor of PP 2 A isolated from Mytilus chilensis with an IC 50 = 0. 25 ng/ml, showed the highest specific inhibition effect an the p-NPP <b>hydrolisis.</b> The calculated IC 50 for DTX 1 and OA was 0. 75 ng/ml and 1. 8 ng/ml respectively...|$|E
