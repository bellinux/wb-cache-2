5000|$|The {{development}} of Tapiola occurred in several stages: the <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> 1952 - 1956, the western neighbourhood, 1957-1960, the town centre 1958-1961-1970, the northern neighbourhood 1958-1967, the southern neighbourhood 1961-1965. Planning in Tapiola commenced with architect, Otto-Iivari Meurman's site plan and building schedule which were reviewed from 1951 onwards. His original plan detailed four neighbourhoods split by two crossing roads and set apart by green belts.|$|E
50|$|East of Bangsar Park lies Bukit Persekutuan, a low density {{neighbourhood}} {{developed in}} the colonial days and Bukit Damansara.

Bærum, particularly its <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> bordering West End Oslo, is one of Norways priciest and most fashionable residential areas, leading Bærum residents to be frequently stereotyped as snobs in Norwegian popular culture. The municipality has been voted the best Norwegian place to live in considering governance and public services to citizens.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{urbanization}} of the <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> of Genoa, only narrow {{roads and}} paths crossed {{the hills and}} the cliffs where today Corso Italia runs. The promenade was built after the First World War, as result of the ambitious development plan of the whole neighbourhood of Albaro, approved in 1914. During the late 1980s and the early 1990s it went through a complete restyling, which included new sidewalks and street furnitures.|$|R
5000|$|One Hama resident, {{a doctor}} {{who did not want}} to be {{identified}} for fear of arrest, told Reuters that tanks were attacking Hama from four different directions and [...] "firing randomly". Another resident said snipers had climbed onto the roofs of the state-owned electricity company and the main prison, and that electricity had been cut in <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhoods.</b> [...] Syrian government tanks also fired on mosques where the loudspeakers broadcast, [...] "Allahu Akbar".|$|R
50|$|Hizma (حزما; חיזמה) is a Palestinian {{town in the}} Jerusalem Governorate, seven {{kilometers}} from Jerusalem's Old City. The town, located in Area B, borders the Israeli settlements Neve Yaakov, Pisgat Ze'ev located in East Jerusalem and the settlements Geva Binyamin and Almon. A small <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> of Hizma is called Hizmah. Since 1967, Hizma is occupied by Israel. The village is cut off from Jerusalem by the Israeli West Bank barrier in the west, which was built in 2005 on confiscated Palestinian land. As of 2007, Hizma had {{a population of about}} 5650 residents. Hizma is cut off from the West Bank by a chain of Israeli settlements in the east.|$|E
50|$|Although the Eastern Partnership {{was inaugurated}} on 7 May 2009, {{academic}} research critically analysing the policy became available by early 2010 Research findings from a UK ESRC research project examining the EU's relations with three Eastern Partnership member states, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova notes both conceptual and empirical dilemmas. First, conceptually the EU has limited uniform {{awareness of what}} it is trying to promote in its <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> under the aegis of 'shared values', 'collective norms' and ‘joint ownership'. Secondly, empirically, the EU seems to favour a ‘top-down’ governance approach (based on rule/norm transfer and conditionality) in its relations with outsiders, which is clearly at odds with a voluntary idea of 'partnership', and explicitly limits the input of 'the other' in the process of reform.|$|E
50|$|First, {{from the}} {{examination}} of official documents, elite interviews and public surveys across the EU border, it has transpired that conceptually the EU has limited uniform awareness {{of what it is}} trying to promote in its <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> under the aegis of ‘shared values’, ‘collective norms’ and ‘joint ownership’. Not only is there a discrepancy in the EU's own rhetoric - juxtaposing its ‘universalist’ values of democracy, human rights {{and the rule of law}} (Europeanisation), with its ‘realist’ security ‘needs’ to protect its borders and safeguard its own citizenry (securitisation); there is also an evident clash of the EU's vision of good governance with what the neighbours perceive to be such, stemming from their own unique historical experiences and cultural traditions.|$|E
50|$|The Harbour {{line was}} officially opened on 12 December 1910, between Kurla and Reay Road. It was named so because it catered to the <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> along the city's natural harbour. In 1925, {{the line was}} {{connected}} to the then Victoria Terminus via an elevated rail corridor between Dockyard Road and Sandhurst Road. The country's first EMU rakes, manufactured by English Electric Company, were introduced between Bombay VT & Kurla on the Harbour line in 1925.|$|R

30|$|According to the EU's Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP) regulations, this {{programme}} is open {{to third}} countries too. From the <b>Eastern</b> European <b>neighbourhood</b> countries, Armenia, Moldova and Ukraine participate in the Enterprise Europe Network of CIPi (a network of regional consortia providing integrated business and innovation support services for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs)) without receiving financial support from the programme. In addition, Moldova and Ukraine participate in the Intelligent Energy Agencies initiative of CIP again without financial support from the programme. All other <b>Eastern</b> European <b>neighbourhood</b> countries have not been involved yet in CIP.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> led {{to the implementation of}} important planning principles such as providing facilities that encourage interaction and foster a sense of community as well as the separation of vehicles and pedestrians. It was also deemed necessary to have a mixture of building types located within the one area to encourage social diversification. The eastern and western residential areas of Tapiola featured curved streets with lots of varying sizes and positions, whilst the northern neighbourhood designed by architect Pentti Ahola, marked a return to the orthogonal grid plan. Ahola's design however, reflected the original aims of Tapiola; that of encouraging social diversification by locating a variety of building types within the one area. Financial concerns affected the {{development of}} the western area of Tapiola, leading to the construction of housing units that were economically feasible.|$|E
5000|$|Although the Eastern Partnership {{was inaugurated}} on 7 May 2009, {{academic}} research critically analysing the policy became available by early 2010 (see Elena Korosteleva#Building Research Excellence in Russian and East European Studies at the Universities of Tartu, Uppsala and Kent). Research findings from a UK ESRC research project examining the EU's relations with three Eastern Partnership member states—namely, Belarus, Ukraine, and Moldova—notes both conceptual and empirical dilemmas. First, conceptually the EU has limited uniform {{awareness of what}} it is trying to promote in its <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhood</b> under the aegis of [...] "shared values", [...] "collective norms", and [...] "joint ownership". Secondly, empirically, the EU seems to favour a [...] "top-down" [...] governance approach (based on rule/norm transfer and conditionality) in its relations with outsiders, which is clearly at odds with a voluntary idea of [...] "partnership", and explicitly limits the input of [...] "the other" [...] in the process of reform.|$|E
50|$|A housing {{team was}} created to {{appraise}} the architects' housing designs; this process occurred more frequently during {{the development of the}} <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhood.</b> Team members were {{from a wide range of}} fields and included a building engineer, a heating engineer, two independent architects, an electrical engineer, a landscape gardener, a domestic science expert, a child welfare expert, a sociologist, and a housewife. This unique team, coupled with the board of the Housing Foundation, assessed housing designs, taking into consideration the needs and desires of future residents from a diverse range of backgrounds. The parties had different beliefs and values, which sometimes led to disagreements, for example the Housing Foundation was concerned with economising whilst the home-economics experts were chiefly concerned with the needs of families. Thus planning in Tapiola was collaborative and proactive as it involved targeting specific family types and classes, deciding on an ideal lifestyle for these residents, which accordingly influenced their behaviours. Many dwellings were designed to house a specific family-type and lifestyle. For example, it was perceived to be ideal to have families with children reside in dwellings, at or close to ground level in order for the children to have better access to the outdoors and to parks, whilst a tower block with one-room flats was designed to accommodate childless couples.|$|E

40|$|The paper aims {{to capture}} - from a politico-institutional and legal {{point of view}} - the current {{challenges}} that the European project is facing with {{in the field of}} Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) / Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). In this context, it has been assessed the consistency and credibility of the EU profile in the crisis management both in its Southern and <b>Eastern</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> as well as the perspectives of EU - NATO Strategic Partnership and cooperation. Moreover, the paper critically examines the legal mechanisms and procedures in force in the field of CFSP / CSDP, putting forward, at the same time, some concrete suggestions and proposals for possible improvements...|$|R
40|$|Since its {{inception}} {{at the beginning}} of the 2000 s, the approach of the European Union (EU) towards its neighbourhood has been afforded significant attention by the academic literature. Many research projects and studies have presented significant empirical insights regarding the way the EU has developed its approach towards its southern and <b>eastern</b> <b>neighbourhoods</b> (Theuns 2017; Ademmer, Delcour, and Wolczuk 2016; Nilsson and Silander 2016; Edwards 2008; Bechev and Nicolaïdis 2010; Beauguitte, Richard, and Guérin-Pace 2015). At the same time, the success and effectiveness of the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP) has been debated and reviewed by official institutions, think tanks or scholars, with the EU almost always lagging behind its ambitious goals and commitments (Schumacher 2015) ...|$|R
