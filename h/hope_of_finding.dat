5|$|Sarah was {{relieved}} {{to move back to}} England. The Duke of Marlborough became one of the king's close advisers, and Sarah moved back into Marlborough House, where she flaunted her eldest granddaughter, Lady Henrietta Godolphin, in the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a suitable marriage partner. Henrietta eventually married Thomas Pelham-Holles, first Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in April 1717, and the rest of Sarah's grandchildren went on to make successful marriages.|$|E

5|$|Gerhard Heilmann {{discussed}} Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis at considerable {{length in}} his 1926 book The Origin of Birds. Heilmann examined hatchlings {{of many other}} bird species, both closely related to those studied by Beebe and belonging to more primitive species, in <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> additional evidence for the leg-wings which Beebe had documented. After failing to find such evidence, Heilmann ultimately rejected Beebe's Tetrapteryx hypothesis, and this remained the consensus among ornithologists {{for the next several}} decades. Beebe, however, continued to advance his Tetrapteryx hypothesis as late as the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|On November 20, 1985, {{one week}} later, rescue efforts began to cease. Nearly 4,000relief workers and rescue team members were {{still searching for}} survivors, with little <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> any. By then, the {{official}} death toll was registered at 22,540people; additional counts showed that 3,300 were missing, 20,000homeless, and 4,000injured. Looters raided the ruins and survivors faced concerns of typhus and yellow fever. For most of the relief workers, their job was over.|$|E
5|$|USS Permit, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant WrefordG. Chapple, reached Tagauayan on 13 March, and found PT-32. With two of his three engines out of action, Schumacher felt that his boat was no longer seaworthy. He had Chapple destroy the boat with Permit deck gun. Chapple then took the fifteen PT-32 crewmen back to Corregidor. There, eight of the crew were dis{{embarked}}, while Chapple embarked forty more passengers, thirty-six of them codebreakers. Nonetheless, Chapple was ordered to conduct a regular war patrol, which he did. He finally reached Australia on 7 April. Unaware of this, Bulkeley attempted to locate PT-32. Over the next few days he flew over the area as a passenger in various aircraft, including a P-35 and a P-40, in the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> it.|$|E

5|$|AFIS {{made several}} {{attempts}} {{to call up}} the aircraft. It {{received a call from}} a resident close to Torghatten which said they had heard aircraft noise followed by a crash. Brønnøysund Fire Department and an ambulance helicopter with a doctor was dispatched to Torghatten. The rescue work was made difficult by low clouds, small fires and explosions. The terrain was difficult and the lack of daylight made assisting the situation difficult. A helicopter with medical personnel and the airport direct arrived at 21:25, while a meeting place for the next of kin was established at the airport. At 23:30 the police stated that there was no <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> survivors and the scene changed from a search to an investigation scene. Due to the fog {{it was not possible to}} verify that all people had been killed until the next day. Seventy-five soldiers from the Home Guard participated in the salvage.|$|E
5|$|Although Beebe and {{his team}} enjoyed {{rewarding}} seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. The reason they gave in their annual report was that the previous two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to analyze it, but in reality this was more the result of insufficient funding {{as well as the}} unstable state of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a comprehensive study of the area's ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area's politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a site for a research station where the politics would be more secure. Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état installed Marcos Pérez Jiménez as Venezuela's dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela. Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book High Jungle, which was the last of Beebe's major books.|$|E
5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> subjects for his experiments. He was particularly interested in locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E

5|$|Numerous {{efforts were}} {{launched}} from St John's in the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> more survivors. An English schooner, John Clements, {{spent a week}} searching, before returning with Arctics flagstaff but no personnel. The New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, owners of the steamer Victoria, offered their vessel to the US consul for a fee of $500 a day, an action which led to considerable local press criticism. By contrast, the Bishop of Newfoundland, the Right Revd Edward Feild, provided his private yacht Hawk free of charge. Eventually Victoria agreed to assist without payment, although an unnamed correspondent of the Public Ledger doubted whether the ship made more than a perfunctory search. None of the ships other than John Clements found any definite traces of Arctic. Some {{reported that they had}} sighted debris, but were not able to identify or recover it.|$|E
5|$|Sometime around 1850, PedroII began having {{discreet}} {{affairs with}} other women. The {{most famous and}} enduring of these relationships involved Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to {{the necessity of a}} marriage of state to a woman for whom he never felt passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.|$|E

SpongeBob finds a note saying that Gary has left in search of a new owner. Meanwhile, Gary has wandered into a new city, encountering a gang of snails. A kind old lady discovers Gary and mistakes him for one of her pets, Miss Tuftsy. Gary is showered with love and food while SpongeBob goes to work, sad that Gary is still missing. Mr. Krabs encourages SpongeBob to work, but SpongeBob misinterprets him, and he takes the day off to look for Gary. He and Patrick put up posters and signs everywhere in the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> Gary.|$|E

5|$|The major {{characteristic}} of Prester John tales {{from this period}} is the king's portrayal not as an invincible hero, but merely one of many adversaries defeated by the Mongols. But as the Mongol Empire collapsed, Europeans began to shift away from the idea that Prester John had ever really been a Central Asian king. At any rate they had little <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> him there, as travel in the region became dangerous without the security the Empire had provided. In works such as The Travels of Sir John Mandeville and Historia Trium Regum by John of Hildesheim, Prester John's domain tends to regain its fantastic aspects and finds itself located not on the steppes of Central Asia, but back in India proper, or some other exotic locale. Wolfram von Eschenbach tied the history of Prester John to the Holy Grail legend in his poem Parzival, in which the Prester {{is the son of}} the Grail maiden and the Saracen knight Feirefiz.|$|E
5|$|The maximum fine that Landis could impose was $29,240,000. To aid {{the judge}} in {{determining}} the sentence, Landis issued a subpoena for Rockefeller to testify as to Standard Oil's assets. The tycoon had often evaded subpoenas, not having testified in court since 1888. Deputy United States marshals visited Rockefeller's several homes, {{as well as the}} estates of his friends, in the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> him. After several days, Rockefeller was found at his lawyer's estate, Taconic Farm in northwestern Massachusetts, and was served with the subpoena. The tycoon duly came to Landis's Chicago courtroom, making his way through a mob anxious to see the proceedings. Rockefeller's actual testimony, proffered after the judge made him wait through several cases and witnesses, proved to be anticlimactic, as he professed almost no knowledge of Standard Oil's corporate structure or assets.|$|E
5|$|This too {{was intercepted}} and photographed but, {{as it was}} a {{relatively}} harmless letter, it was forwarded on while the British authorities continued to monitor Lody's communications in the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> out more about the German espionage network. The day after sending it, on 15 September, Lody travelled to London to reconnoitre the city's war preparations. Travelling light, he stayed for two nights at the Ivanhoe Hotel in Bloomsbury (now the Bloomsbury Street Hotel) and set to work finding information about the security measures at public buildings. He said later that he had not actually observed the buildings himself but had obtained cuttings from newspapers, which he intended to send to Berlin. He also wrote a report on 16 September, but claimed that he had never sent it– it was never found by the British– as he felt that it was poorly written.|$|E

5|$|Tidus makes few {{appearances}} in {{the plot of the}} 2003 sequel, Final Fantasy X-2, although meeting him is the player's objective. Two years after the events of Final Fantasy X, Yuna sees a sphere with a young man (resembling Tidus) trapped in a prison. She joins the Gullwings, a sphere-hunting group, and travels around Spira in the <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> more clues that Tidus is alive. The individual in the sphere is later revealed as Shuyin. Depending on the player's development during the game, the fayth will appear to Yuna at the end and tell her that they can make Tidus return to her. He then appears in Spira, and he and Yuna are reunited. In another final scene, Tidus (unsure whether or not he is still a dream) wants to remain with Yuna. He is also an unlockable character as Star Player, a blitzball player. In Final Fantasy X-2: International + Last Mission (the game's updated version), Tidus is a playable character for battles. An extra episode, set after the original game's play-through, reveals that he is living in Besaid with Yuna. An illusion of Tidus also appears as a boss character.|$|E
5|$|Saavedro is the {{antagonist}} of Exile. Depicted as a vengeful {{and broken}} man, Saavedro is an inhabitant of the Age of Narayan, {{one of the}} Ages chosen by Atrus to try to teach his sons Sirrus and Achenar about the Art of writing books linking to other worlds. Saavedro agrees to help tutor Atrus' sons, but is shocked when the brothers instigate a destructive rebellion and abandon the Age to be destroyed from within. When Saavedro pursues Sirrus and Achenar to the Age of J'nanin, he is assaulted and left for dead. Trapped on J'nanin and believing Narayan destroyed and his family to be dead, Saavedro's mental health deteriorates during his years of captivity. When Saavedro is unexpectedly freed and travels to Tomahna in <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> the brothers, he steals the linking book for Releeshahn in a plan to lure Atrus to Narayan and exact revenge. Once on Narayan, Saavedro discovers that his people have not been destroyed. Cornered by the Stranger, Saavedro gives up the Releeshahn book. In the game's optimal ending, the player enables Saavedro to peacefully return to Narayan, before taking Releeshahn back to Atrus. Saavedro is portrayed by veteran actor Brad Dourif, who accepted the role of Saavedro {{because he was a}} Myst fan. Dourif said that his role for the game was much more difficult than working on movie sets, as he could not see the player he was addressing or interact with the game environment.|$|E

He then uses the immeasurably strong ability and {{strength}} of the two Sakuras to resurrect Yūko, accidentally frozen in time by Clow Reed himself to halt her death, therein proving himself Clow's superior. Yūko uses her life and Clow's magic as payment to make the clones reborn {{in the past to}} live together. As the two know all of the series' events would repeat, the clones seal themselves in Yūko's shop until the battle against him. The group manages to kill Fei-Wang, who traps Syaoran in a void between time and space, dragging both his clone and Watanuki along as a consequence of their connection. With their creator's death, both clones of Sakura and Syaoran fade away leaving behind two feathers. Syaoran and Watanuki escape from the void for a price: Syaoran must continue traveling through the dimensions forever, while Watanuki must stay in Yūko's shop. The group rests in the Kingdom of Clow where Fai, Kurogane, and Mokona decide to join Syaoran once again in <b>hope</b> <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> a way to bring back the clones who still exist as the two feathers.
