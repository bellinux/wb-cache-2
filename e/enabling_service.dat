40|$|This master thesis {{provides}} {{a study of}} the initial generic component model developed within the Service Platform for Innovative Communication Environment (SPICE) project and gives some examples of service components focusing on enabling components. An evaluation of the metadata describing these components is given along with the description of a roaming service functionality. This thesis defines the term <b>enabling</b> <b>service,</b> which is a service used by another service in order to provide parts of the service functionality. Enabling services can be Instant Messaging enablers, location enablers and service discovery facilities. Proper metadata descriptions of these components are important in order to provide efficient discovery. Service roaming can also be seen as an <b>enabling</b> <b>service</b> providing the means for a user to change domains while still maintaining a service offer. This can be realised by a roaming agent who communicates with entities in both the home domain and the visited domain. In collaboration with two other students a testbed implementing a service for demonstration realising the SPICE E-Tourism scenario has been set up. The specification, implementation and testing of the service is included in this thesis focusing on the enabling services and the component support. Finally a discussion of the implemented system is given to evaluate the development methodology for the SPICE service components and to highlight possible improvements. </p...|$|E

HUMANET message routing protocols exploit human mobility patterns to significantly increase communication efficiency while limiting {{the exposure of}} messages to mobile service providers. Initial results from tracedriven simulation show that 85 % of messages reach their intended destinations while using orders of magnitude less network capacity than naïve epidemic flooding techniques. ...|$|E

We argue that the {{design thinking}} concept is in line with a service-dominant logic rather than a goods-dominant logic, and that this approach can be the basis for communicating the value of design to clients.

40|$|A {{dynamically}} extensible {{control plane}} {{is a key}} enabling feature of next generation intelligent self-configuring networks.

These services consume unpredictable amounts of resources at node with unknown resource availability. This paper presents an autonomic resource management model for extensible control plane, called C-QoS. Under the C-QoS model, services are classified into classes according to their importance or QoS requirements. Resources are allocated among classes according to a differentiated per-class resource allocation scheme, while Services within a class receive fair treatment. Due to the difficulty of determining resource availability in heterogenous infrastructure or service resource requirements, this scheme is dynamically adaptive to each resource according to its demand patterns. 1...|$|E
