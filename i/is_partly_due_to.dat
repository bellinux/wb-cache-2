5|$|From the 1960s, {{the rates}} of lung {{adenocarcinoma}} started to rise relative to other types of lung cancer. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the introduction of filter cigarettes. The use of filters removes larger particles from tobacco smoke, thus reducing deposition in larger airways. However, the smoker has to inhale more deeply to receive {{the same amount of}} nicotine, increasing particle deposition in small airways where adenocarcinoma tends to arise. The incidence of lung adenocarcinoma continues to rise.|$|E
5|$|Messiaen's {{music has}} been {{described}} as outside the western musical tradition, although growing out of that tradition and being influenced by it. Much of his output denies the western conventions of forward motion, development and diatonic harmonic resolution. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the symmetries of his technique—for instance the modes of limited transposition do not admit the conventional cadences found in western classical music.|$|E
5|$|The Moon has an {{exceptionally}} low albedo, {{giving it a}} reflectance that is slightly brighter than that of worn asphalt. Despite this, it is the brightest object in the sky after the Sun. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the brightness enhancement of the opposition effect; at quarter phase, the Moon is only one-tenth as bright, rather than half as bright, as at full moon.|$|E
500|$|This may <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> lack of {{attention}} paid to clinical application by Bowlby himself and <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> broader meanings of the word 'attachment' used amongst practitioners. It may also <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the mistaken association of attachment theory with the pseudoscientific interventions misleadingly known as [...] "attachment therapy".|$|R

5|$|There are {{questions}} about the external validity of the AS diagnosis. That is, {{it is unclear whether}} there is a practical benefit in distinguishing AS from HFA and from PDD-NOS; the same child can receive different diagnoses depending on the screening tool. The debate about distinguishing AS from HFA <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> a tautological dilemma where disorders are defined based on severity of impairment, so that studies that appear to confirm differences based on severity are to be expected.|$|E
5|$|The weather of Mount Washington is {{notoriously}} erratic. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> {{the convergence of}} several storm tracks, mainly from the Atlantic to the south, the Gulf region and the Pacific Northwest. The vertical rise of the Presidential Range, combined with its north-south orientation, makes it a significant barrier to westerly winds. Low-pressure areas are more favorable to develop along the coastline in the winter due to the relative temperature differences between the Northeastern United States and the Atlantic Ocean. With these factors combined, hurricane-force wind gusts are observed from {{the summit of the}} mountain on average of 110 days per year.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} that Æthelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the lack of sources—nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. Æthelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.|$|E

50|$|Note: The large {{increases}} in the year beginning April 2006 <b>were</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> travelcards for National Rail journeys being made from stations that have only a London Underground office and also using a different methodology to estimate likely journeys made from National Rail stations in Zone 1. The large {{increases in}} the year beginning April 2010 <b>were</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> Oyster Cards being introduced in January 2010, and new rolling stock.|$|R
5|$|Although {{the initial}} {{appointments}} to the Order were largely political, from the 1770s appointments to the Order were increasingly made for naval, military or diplomatic achievements. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the conflicts Britain {{was engaged in}} over this period. The Peninsular War resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of Extra Knights in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military note to the Order. Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period not exceeding 42 days in any year, to serve {{in any part of}} Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four trumpeters, and was also to appoint eight officers for this body, however the statute was never invoked.|$|E
5|$|The area rapidly {{changed from}} European American to African-American in the 1920s. By 1930, the {{population}} was only 7.8% white. By 1960, {{the population was}} 0.5% white. From 1950 to 2000 {{the total population of}} the neighborhood declined from 57,000 to 14,146. This population decline <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> initiatives of the Chicago Land Clearance Commission, who acted under the 1955 Amendment to the Blighted Areas Redevelopment Act, which empowered redevelopment authorities that have acquired land by condemnation or otherwise to redevelop such lands for non-residential uses. A good example of the Land Clearing commission activities is the Lake Meadows Park to the north of Washington Park. The failure of the evolution of industry and commerce in the community, the above-mentioned white flight and land redevelopment for non-residential use combined lead to population decline.|$|E
5|$|Since 2009, the {{intensity}} of the rivalry has waned as the duo's domination of the domestic game has decreased. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the resurgence of North Belfast derby clubs, Cliftonville and Crusaders. In 2013, Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to lift the league title since Portadown did so in 2002. In 2014, Cliftonville went on to retain the title {{for the first time in}} the club's history, with Crusaders then winning the 2014–15 title in convincing fashion, finishing 10 points ahead of runners-up Linfield. During this time, Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013 and again in 2015, but their overall fortunes on the field have taken a relative downturn. The club has won only three league titles since the turn of the 21st century; in 2002–03, 2004–05 and 2008–09. Since then, they have finished as low as ninth place in the 2016–17 season. The last season in which the two clubs finished as champions and runners-up in either order was 2008–09, and they have not met in a major domestic cup final since 2006, when they contested both the Irish Cup and the League Cup finals.|$|E

50|$|During World War II Kongsberg {{was under}} German control. Production, however, {{never came up}} to such numbers as the {{occupation}} forces wanted. This <b>was</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> access to raw materials, but also resistance among factory workers.|$|R
5000|$|The {{color of}} a wine can <b>be</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> co-pigmentation of anthocyanidins with other non-pigmented {{flavonoids}} or natural phenols (cofactors or [...] "copigments").|$|R
25|$|Labor {{productivity}} in GWI is relatively high with {{a ratio of}} 3 staff per 1,000 connections in 2007. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the contracting out of services such as leak repairs.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though these}} children's work remains seasonal, {{the fact that}} child labor still occurs <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the fact that {{agricultural}} enterprises with a very limited workforce {{are not subject to}} Government law.|$|E
25|$|The Sydney Swans {{averaged}} 41,205 {{people through}} the gate per home match in Sydney during 2006. In 2013, the average has decreased to 29,104. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the redevelopment of the Bradman Stand at the SCG.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the success of Irish Thoroughbreds, both at home and abroad, <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> its climate and geography; the wet, temperate climate and limestone-rich soil encourages the growth of calcium-containing grass, while the mild temperatures and lack of seasonal variability allow year-round grazing.|$|E
25|$|Tibetan history, as it {{has been}} recorded, is {{particularly}} focused on the history of Buddhism in Tibet. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the pivotal role this religion has played in the development of Tibetan and Mongol cultures and partly because almost all native historians of the country were Buddhist monks.|$|E
25|$|Since the German {{premiere of}} Cats in 1986, {{there have always}} been musicals running, {{including}} The Phantom of the Opera, The Lion King, Dirty Dancing and Dance of the Vampires. This density, the highest in Germany, <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> the major musical production company Stage Entertainment being based in the city.|$|E

25|$|In acute {{states of}} severe stress, {{cortisol}} secretion by {{the adrenal gland}} increases up to sixfold, parallel to {{the severity of the}} condition. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> <b>due</b> <b>to</b> an increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).
