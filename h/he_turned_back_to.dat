25|$|Herrera, {{with much}} difficulty, {{was able to}} {{assemble}} a force of 6,000 men. This was put {{under the command of}} General Mariano Paredes y Arrillaga and sent to the north to fight the Americans. Paredes got as far as San Luis Potosí, but instead of marching north against the invaders, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the capital in December and overthrew President Herrera.|$|E
25|$|After {{reaching}} Lake Urmia, {{he turned}} east and entered Zikirtu and Andia on the Caspian {{slopes of the}} Caucasus. When news reached him that king Rusa I was moving against him, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Lake Urmia in forced marches and defeated a Urartian army in a steep valley of the Uaush (probably the Sahend, east of Lake Urmia, or further to the south, in Mannaea country), a steep mountain that reached the clouds and whose flanks were covered by snow. The battle is described as the usual carnage, but King Rusas managed to escape. The horses of his chariot {{had been killed by}} Assyrian spears, forcing him to ride a mare in order to get away, very unbecoming for a king.|$|E
25|$|Charles {{took time}} to rally more men and prepare. By the {{following}} spring, Charles had attracted enough support to invade Neustria. Charles sent an envoy who proposed a secession of hostilities if Chilperic would recognize his rights as mayor of the palace in Austrasia. The refusal was not unexpected but served to impress upon Martel's forces the unreasonableness of the Neustrians. They met near Cambrai at the Battle of Vincy on 21 March 717. The victorious Martel pursued the fleeing king and mayor to Paris, but as he was not yet prepared to hold the city, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> deal with Plectrude and Cologne. He took the city and dispersed her adherents. Plectrude was allowed to retire to a convent; Theudoald lived to 741 under his uncle's protection, a kindness—unusual for those times, when mercy to a former gaoler, or a potential rival, was rare.|$|E

25|$|When King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette were {{executed}} in the French Revolution, Spain prepared {{to join the}} First Coalition. King Charles IV of Spain promoted Ricardos to Captain General (CG) and sent him take command of the army in Catalonia. When the War of the Pyrenees broke out, Ricardos invaded France on 17 April 1793 with 4,500 soldiers, capturing Saint-Laurent-de-Cerdans. He then routed 1,800 Frenchmen at Céret on the 20th, thus isolating the imposing Fort de Bellegarde at the Pass of Le Perthus. After beating Louis-Charles de Flers and the French Army of the Eastern Pyrenees at the Battle of Mas Deu on 19 May, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> invest Bellegarde. The Siege of Bellegarde ended on 24 June when the French garrison surrendered. Ricardos faced de Flers again in the Battle of Perpignan on 17 July. On his occasion, Ricardos was defeated, but only after inflicting 800 killed and wounded on his enemies.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{completed}} his operational tour in March 1943, having carried out 150 sorties and destroying eight enemy aircraft. He {{was awarded a}} Bar to his DFC in June. After some months in Canada, where he lectured New Zealand air crew trainees, Grant returned to England in November 1943 and was given command of No. 65 Squadron. Early in 1944 he was appointed wing commander (flying) of No. 122 Wing, equipped with Mustangs. On 28 February 1944, Grant took off for a sortie across the English Channel. Shortly after take off, in cloud, the engine of his fighter cut out. After ordering the wing to carry on without him, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> base. On coming out of cloud at 1000 feet, he bailed out but was too low for his parachute to open properly and fell to his death. The crash site {{is located on the}} eastbound A13 carriageway approximately 100 metres east of the A128 flyover above the main A13 London to Southend Road. Grant was buried at Brookwood Military Cemetery.|$|E
500|$|Ceawlin's last {{recorded}} {{victory is}} in 584. [...] The entry reads [...] "Here Ceawlin and Cutha {{fought against the}} Britons at the place which is named Fethan leag, and Cutha was killed; and Ceawlin took many towns and countless war-loot, and in anger <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his own [...]" [...] There is a wood named [...] "Fethelée" [...] mentioned in a twelfth-century document that relates to Stoke Lyne, in Oxfordshire, and it now is thought that the battle of Fethan leag must have been fought in this area.|$|E

500|$|The phrase [...] "in anger <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his own" [...] {{probably}} {{indicates that}} this annal {{is drawn from}} saga material, as perhaps are all of the early Wessex annals. [...] It also {{has been used to}} argue that perhaps, Ceawlin did not win the battle and that the chronicler chose not to record the outcome fully – a king does not usually come home [...] "in anger" [...] after taking [...] "many towns and countless war-loot". [...] It may be that Ceawlin's overlordship of the southern Britons came to an end with this battle.|$|E
500|$|Mercator never {{committed}} any of {{his prison}} experiences to paper; all he would say {{was that he had}} suffered an [...] "unjust persecution". For the rest of his time in Leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his work. His brush with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for globes, compasses, astrolabe and astronomical rings. They were ready in 1545 and the Emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. Sadly they were soon destroyed {{in the course of the}} Emperor's military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost. He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed wall map of Europe which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.|$|E
2500|$|David Livingstone was {{the first}} European to reach Nyangwe in March 1871.

But looking round at the door, and seeing this dejected figure, <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> it, touches it with a mild hand, says ‘Good night!’ A sob is his only acknowledgment.

2500|$|In 1212, John's {{quarrel with}} Pope Innocent III and Philip Augustus reached a {{breaking}} point, and Innocent absolved the barons of England from their allegiance to John. John {{was preparing to}} march at Nottingham against his rebellious son-in-law Llewelyn ab Iorwerth. His suspicions that his barons were plotting to capture him were aroused by private intelligence, and <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London with his foreign mercenaries, disbanding his regular forces. He demanded that each baron send a relative {{to him as a}} hostage. Most of the barons did so, but Fitzwalter and de Vesci decided to flee, to France and Scotland respectively. They were condemned to perpetual exile. But John was so much alarmed that he shut himself up from his subjects, and abandoned his projected Welsh campaign. [...] John now seized upon Fitzwalter's estates, and on 14 January 1213 destroyed Baynard's Castle. He also demolished Robert's castle of Benington and his woods in Essex. Fitzwalter remained in exile until John's submission to the pope. Fitzwalter's sister, Alice Peche, was required to provide hostages to prove her loyalty. One hostage was her and Gilbert Peche's daughter, Alice.|$|E

50|$|Lister, Kochanski and Cat are bluffing {{their way}} past the crew with their geeky disguises and claims to be {{computer}} programmers when they run into Kryten again, who begins to recognise them.
