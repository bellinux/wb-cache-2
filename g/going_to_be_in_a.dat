25|$|On {{the accusations}} of being docile, Mathieu writes in her {{autobiography}} {{that she and}} Johnny Stark understood each other. She {{wanted to be a}} singer, and he was tired of people who just wanted to be famous. They were both hard workers, and he kept her schedule filled with lucrative contracts. She also writes that she was forbidden to read the press, and, having peeked at some of it, was content to follow that rule. Stark, of course, had a heavy hand in manipulating the press. Mireille writes that her mother was often surprised to read on the front page that she was engaged to someone famous, or was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> movie by some famous director. Her guiding principle was just to sing, and never have her family return to the tenements of Croix des Oiseaux.|$|E

He ran the idea of quitting his job at Eli Lilly by then-longtime girlfriend Tracy Wilhelmy. She {{thought about it for}} two hours before telling him to go for it. [...] "Now, it looks like a great idea," [...] Stevens later remarked. [...] "At the time, I thought it was something I really wanted to try." [...] Tracy went back to school to get a law degree that could support the couple if things did not work out for Brad. [...] "We were 23 and realized this was our chance," [...] Tracy later said. [...] "Five years down the road, we were probably not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to do that. The more success you had at Lilly, the harder it would be to leave." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this, the duo {{have not}} staged a {{full-scale}} tour or performed shows since 2010. Garfunkel confirmed to Rolling Stone in 2014 {{that he believes}} they will tour in the future, although Simon had been too [...] "busy" [...] in recent years. [...] "I know that audiences {{all over the world}} like Simon and Garfunkel. I'm with them. But I don't think Paul Simon's with them," [...] he remarked. In a 2016 interview with NPR's David Greene, when asked about the possibility of reuniting, Simon stated; [...] "Well, I don't think most people do [...] The fact is, is, like, we did do two big reunions, and we're done. There's nothing really much to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] And, you know, I mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun. If it was fun, I'd say, OK, sometimes we'll go out and sing old songs in harmony. That's cool. But when it's not fun, you know, and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> tense situation, well, then I have a lot of musical areas that I like to play in. So that'll never happen again. That's that." ...|$|E

500|$|Patton chose Steve Henry, {{a surgeon}} and county {{commissioner}} from Louisville, {{as his running}} mate. His major opposition in the Democratic primary came from secretary of state Bob Babbage and President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate John [...] "Eck" [...] Rose. Although sitting governor Brereton Jones did not officially endorse Patton, Rose referred to Jones as Patton's [...] "mentor". Rose charged that, like Jones, Patton would not take a hard stand on the issues; referring to a nickname given to Jones in the 1991 campaign, Rose remarked [...] "If you have liked Jell-O Jones, then you are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to love Puddin' Paul Patton." [...] Particularly odious to Rose was that Patton had publicly supported collective wage bargaining for public employees, but had declared {{that he would not}} fight for it in the upcoming 1996 legislative session. Though Babbage and Rose were political veterans and solid campaigners, Patton won 152,203votes in the primary, well over the 40percent needed to avoid a runoff. Babbage ran second with 81,352votes and Rose was third with 71,740votes. Two other candidates split the remaining 33,344votes.|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's {{very difficult}} for me. Because it is lines on paper when I {{do it in the}} comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
500|$|Many {{familiar}} voices {{inspired the}} animators in their {{creation of the}} characters and helped them shape their personalities. This use of familiar voices for key characters was a rarity in Disney's past films. The staff was shocked to hear that a wise cracking comedian, Phil Harris was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Kipling film. Disney suggested Harris after meeting him at a party. Harris improvised most of his lines, as he considered the scripted lines [...] "didn't feel natural". After Harris was cast, Disneyland Records president Jimmy Johnson suggested Disney to get Louis Prima as King Louie, as he [...] "felt that Louis would be great as foil". Walt also cast other prominent actors such as George Sanders as Shere Khan and Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera. Additionally, he cast regular Disney voices such as Sterling Holloway as Kaa, J. Pat O'Malley as Colonel Hathi and Buzzie the Vulture and Verna Felton as Hathi's wife. This was her last film before she died. David Bailey was originally cast as Mowgli, but his voice changed during production, leading Bailey to not fit the [...] "young innocence of Mowgli's character" [...] at which the producers were aiming. Thus director Wolfgang Reitherman cast his son Bruce, who had just voiced Christopher Robin in Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree. The animators shot footage of Bruce {{as a guide for}} the character's performance. Child actress Darlene Carr was going around singing in the studio when composers Sherman Brothers asked her to record a demo of [...] "My Own Home". Carr's performance impressed Disney enough for him to cast her as the role of the human girl.|$|E

Osbourne injects Copaxone medication daily, uses vitamin supplements and hormone replacement therapy, and has travelled to Europe for stem cell therapy.

2500|$|In MKII, Kahn was {{digitally}} resized to a taller {{height to}} make him tower over the playable characters. Ironically, the actor who played him, bodybuilder Brian Glynn (who [...] "couldn't believe" [...] he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Mortal Kombat game), {{was not nearly as}} imposing in comparison; a photograph published in GamePro of Glynn and Mortal Kombat co-creator Ed Boon standing side-by-side, which was snapped during production of the game, showed that Boon was taller. In many official depictions of Shao Kahn made by Midway, he is shown wearing a cape, though he never wore one in his original digitized appearances. Mortal Kombat: Deception {{was the first time in}} which he wore the cape in-game. Mortal Kombat sound designer Dan Forden explained that the reason for Kahn not wearing the cape in earlier games, in addition to Kabal not being able to wear a trenchcoat in Mortal Kombat 3, was that loose flowing clothing took up memory.|$|E

6000|$|The {{process of}} Lapham's {{financial}} disintegration {{was like the}} course of some chronic disorder, which has fastened itself upon the constitution, but advances with continual reliefs, with apparent amelioration, and at times seems not to advance at all, when it gives hope of final recovery {{not only to the}} sufferer, but to the eye of science itself. There were moments when James Bellingham, seeing Lapham pass this crisis and that, began to fancy that he might pull through altogether; and at these moments, when his adviser could not oppose anything but experience and probability to the evidence of the fact, Lapham was buoyant with courage, and imparted his hopefulness to his household. Our theory of disaster, of sorrow, of affliction, borrowed from the poets and novelists, is that it is incessant; but every passage in our own lives and in the lives of others, so far as we have witnessed them, teaches us that this is false. The house of mourning is decorously darkened to the world, but within itself it is also the house of laughing. Bursts of gaiety, as heartfelt as its grief, relieve the gloom, and the stricken survivors have their jests together, in which the thought of the dead is tenderly involved, and a fond sense, not crazier than many others, of sympathy and enjoyment beyond the silence, justifies the sunnier mood before sorrow rushes back, deploring and despairing, and making it all up again with the conventional fitness of things. Lapham's adversity had this quality in common with bereavement. It was not always like the adversity we figure in allegory; it had its moments of being like prosperity, and if upon the whole it was continual, it was not incessant. Sometimes there was a week of repeated reverses, when he had to keep his teeth set and to hold on hard to all his hopefulness; and then days came of negative result or slight success, when he was full of his jokes at the tea-table, and {{wanted to go to the}} theatre, or to do something to cheer Penelope up. In some miraculous way, by some enormous stroke of success which should eclipse the brightest of his past prosperity, he expected to do what would reconcile all difficulties, not only in his own affairs, but in hers too. [...] "You'll see," [...] he said to his wife; [...] "it's going to come out all right. Irene'll fix it up with Bill's boy, and then she'll be off Pen's mind; and if things go on as they've been going for the last two days, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> position to do the favours myself, and Pen can feel that SHE'S makin' a sacrifice, and then I guess may be she'll do it.
