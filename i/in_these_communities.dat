5|$|In 1957 the Treaties of Rome {{established}} two, similar, communities {{creating a}} common market (European Economic Community) and promoting atomic energy co-operation (Euratom). The three institutions shared the Court of Justice and the Parliament, however {{they had a}} separate Council and High Authority, which was called the Commission <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>Communities.</b> The {{reason for this is}} the different relationship between the Commission and Council. At the time the French government was suspicious of the supranationalism and wanted to limit the powers of the High Authority in the new Communities, giving the Council a greater role in checking the executive.|$|E
5|$|Indian women {{negotiate}} survival {{through an}} array of oppressive patriarchal family structures: age, ordinal status, relationship to men through family of origin, marriage and procreation as well as patriarchal attributes. Examples of patriarchal attributes include: dowry, siring sons etc., kinship, caste, community, village, market and the state. It should however be noted that several communities in India, such as the Nairs of Kerala, Shettys of Mangalore, certain Maratha clans, and Bengali families exhibit matriarchal tendencies. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities,</b> {{the head of the}} family is the oldest woman rather than the oldest man. Sikh culture is also regarded as relatively gender-neutral.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Eddy was a Massachusetts-born {{resident}} of Cumberland County, Nova Scotia, where the fort was located. He and John Allan, {{both of whom}} served in the provincial assembly, were the prime movers of Patriot activity in the area, {{which was one of}} several hotbeds of agitation in Nova Scotia. The other major areas of Patriot activity were Maugerville in the St. John River valley of Sunbury County (present-day New Brunswick), and Cobequid, and there were also pockets of activity in Pictou and the Passamaquoddy Bay area, which separates present-day Maine and New Brunswick. Patriots <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> were in contact with each other, and those of Cumberland and Maugerville were active in trying to interest nearby natives (Passamaquoddy, Maliseet, and Mi'kmaq) in their cause.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, Seacology {{launched}} its largest-ever project, a $3.4 million initiative to protect all of Sri Lanka's remaining mangrove forests and restore many degraded ones. Through Sri Lanka-based NGO Sudeesa (also {{known as the}} Small Fishers Federation of Lanka), Seacology is funding a significant expansion of that organization's existing microloan and job-training programs. In exchange, the beneficiaries of these programs must agree to assist in protecting their local mangrove habitats. The training is designed in part to give low-income women <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> alternatives to harvesting mangroves, a subsistence activity that {{has contributed to the}} forests' degradation. The project also established three large nursery facilities to grow several species of mangroves, to be replanted in areas previously cleared for aquaculture and other unsustainable development, as well as several areas destroyed during the Sri Lankan Civil War.|$|E

25|$|One {{consequence}} of the fires in 2003 has been the increased density of invasive and non-native plant species that have quickly colonized burned areas, especially those {{that had already been}} burned in the previous 15 years. Because shrubs <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> are adapted to a particular historical fire regime, altered fire regimes may change the selective pressures on plants and favor invasive and non-native species that are better able to exploit the novel post-fire conditions.|$|E
25|$|In {{developed}} countries, open defecation {{is considered}} to be a part of voluntary, recreational outdoor activities in remote areas. It is difficult to estimate how many people practice open defecation <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities.</b> But is also of very little public health, environmental and human dignity concern. The situation is very different in developing and less developed countries and communities, where open defecation is of high public health and development concern. The practice of open defecation is strongly related to poverty and exclusion particularly, in case of rural areas and informal urban settlements.|$|E

25|$|The American {{psychologist}} James H. Leuba (1868–1946), in A Psychological Study of Religion, {{accounts for}} mystical experience psychologically and physiologically, pointing to analogies with certain drug-induced experiences. Leuba argued forcibly for a naturalistic treatment of religion, which he {{considered to be}} necessary if religious psychology were {{to be looked at}} scientifically. Shamans {{all over the world and}} in different cultures have traditionally used drugs, especially psychedelics, for their religious experiences. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> the absorption of drugs leads to dreams (visions) through sensory distortion.|$|E
25|$|Beyond the {{influence}} of the New Town movement, Reston was part of a back-to-the-land movement popular in the 1960s and early 1970s. The principles incorporated in the community {{can be seen as a}} reaction to the new suburban communities of the post-war era (e.g., Levittown). Among the problems <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> that Reston responded to included income segregation, a lack of natural preservation, suburbs that served only as bedroom communities for commuters, a lack of public space in new developments, and a lack of community ties in new developments. Many early residents settled in Reston because of the ideals of the community.|$|E

25|$|Historically, {{underground}} {{coal mines}} existed along the Tongue River at {{the communities of}} Monarch, Kleenburn and Acme, about 7 to 10 miles north of Sheridan, Wyoming. These mines were based on seams of coal that outcropped in this area, in the Tongue River valley or on small tributaries off the valley. The CB railroad ran from Sheridan, Wyoming past these mines and on to Billings, Montana, allowing for easy shipment of coal. These underground mines were economically operated from about 1900 to the late 1940s. Miners lived <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> or in Sheridan, Wyoming. Miners in Sheridan commuted the 7 to 10 miles to reach the mines by trolly.|$|E

In the Western culture, the Barbie and Action-Man represent lifelike figures but in an imaginative state out of reach from the society of these children and adults. These toys give way to a unique world in which children's play is isolated and independent of the social constraints placed on society leaving the children free to delve into the imaginary and idealized version of what their development in life could be.|$|E

This means that if one person loses their wallet through a hack, no money can be spent unless another wallet (or wallets if m is more than 2) signs it. Multisignature accounts also help protect community-held funds, in that a majority of designated users must agree before a transaction can be spent from a community-held wallet.

25|$|Adherents of the {{movement}} formed prayer groups called covenant communities. <b>In</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities,</b> members practiced a stronger commitment to spiritual ideals and created documents, or covenants, that set up rules of life. One of the first structured covenant communities was the Word of God Community. It affiliated with the International Communications Office in the 1980s, and its continued growth resulted in a larger overall community called The Sword of the Spirit. The original Word of God Community eventually split from The Sword of the Spirit, however. Of the two original founders of the communities, one stayed with the Word of God and founded an international ministry that reached Eastern Europe and Africa, while the other remained president of the Sword of the Spirit, which as of 2007, had 47 member communities and 16 affiliated communities around the world.|$|E
25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids.

Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous as a result of the strike.|$|E
25|$|In Charismatic and Pentecostal communities, anointing of {{the sick}} is a {{frequent}} practice and {{has been an important}} ritual <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>communities</b> since the respective movements were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These communities use extemporaneous forms of administration at the discretion of the minister, who need not be a pastor. There is minimal ceremony attached to its administration. Usually, several people physically touch (laying on of hands) the recipient during the anointing. It may be part of a worship service with the full assembly of the congregation present, but may also be done in more private settings, such as homes or hospital rooms. Some Pentecostals believe that physical healing is within the anointing and so there is often great expectation or at least great hope that a miraculous cure or improvement will occur when someone is being prayed over for healing.|$|E
50|$|Where {{responsibilities}} of the Flemish Region can be devolved to the provincial level, no such equivalent exists in the Brussels-Capital Region, which itself exercises many competencies for territorial tasks elsewhere assigned to the provinces. The community competencies (education, culture and social welfare) there, are exercised by the two affected institutional communities. The Flemish Community therefore established a local elected council and executive (the Flemish Community Commission or 'VGC') to cater for intermediate-level decision making & public services. The VGC then recognised local, municipal institutions {{to take care of}} the purely local public service <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>community</b> areas (called gemeenschapscentra or community centres).|$|R
