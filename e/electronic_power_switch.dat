40|$|Abstract [...] Testing digital {{controllers}} for <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> {{systems in}} real-time using a real-time digital simulator presents a problem, {{due to the}} discrete nature of the controller outputs which are not necessarily in synchronism with the time-step of the simulator. Reducing the simulation time-step resolves the issues resulting {{from the lack of}} synchronism between the digital simulator and the hardware controller under test. The simulation time can be reduced by distributing the computational burden among a number of parallel processors. However, the reduction in time is not directly proportional to the number of processors due to the interprocessors communication overhead. However, the simulation time can be greatly reduced if the simulator's hardware is custom configured.

The Self-energizing Electro-Hydraulic Brake (SEHB) utilizes the effect of instable self-reinforcement in combination with a closed loop control. Background {{for the development of}} the brake concept is a train application. However, SEHB is not limited to any specific application. Main advantages of the concept are its minimal energy consumption, the closed loop control of the true brake torque and its feedback ability due to the decentralized low-power electronic control. This thesis introduces the new brake principle by comparing it to conventional self-reinforcing brakes. A mathematical distinction is given between self-reinforcement and self-energization on the basis of static considerations. The dynamic characteristics are analyzed using a linearized system description which is further simplified using the method of pole dominance analysis. The simplified model is used to calculate a state dependent proportional controller map on the basis of a damping criteria. Besides the theoretic analysis, the thesis presents the basic hydraulic design criteria and gives a systematic overview over different hydraulic-mechanical design solutions.
