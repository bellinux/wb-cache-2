5|$|In January 2014, Knut's full autopsy {{results were}} {{published}} by the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in the Journal of Comparative Pathology. It was the most in-depth post-mortem ever carried out on an animal. The autopsy revealed that {{the damage to the}} bear’s brain was so severe that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not fallen into the water and drowned he would have died anyway. Experts hypothesized that he was suffering from a virus that caused the encephalitis.|$|E
5|$|In early summer, Jordan Cameron, {{a former}} {{freshman}} basketball player from Brigham Young University, also transferred to USC {{to play football}} as a wide receiver. However, when USC refused to accept some of Cameron's credits from Brigham Young, {{he was forced to}} withdraw and attend Ventura College. He missed the football season but was given the option to try to rejoin the team in 2008. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> stayed at USC, due to NCAA transfer rules he would have been ineligible to play in 2007. Cameron ended up enrolling at USC a year later.|$|E
5|$|Sanders, a bachelor, died without {{knowledge}} of the award of a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions on 12 June 1917. The emergence of correspondence with his first Q-ship commander, A.D Blair, {{makes it clear that}} he at least knew of his VC prior to his death, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not received it. In June 1918, Sanders' father received his son's VC and DSO from the Governor-General of New Zealand. Sander's VC, the only one awarded to a New Zealander serving in the navy, and DSO are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E

5|$|Through March and April {{the divers}} and ships' crews worked to recover {{all manner of}} treasure: silver coins, silver bullion, doubloons, jewelry, {{a small amount of}} gold, and other artifacts. Concerned about the {{possibility}} of mutiny, Phips guaranteed to the crew, who had been hired for seaman's wages, that they would receive shares in the find, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to pay them from his own percentage. He carefully avoided putting in at any ports before anchoring at Gravesend, where he dispatched a courier to London with the news.|$|E
5|$|When questioned, Patrick Darby {{testified that}} in 1824, Beauchamp had {{solicited}} his services {{in order to}} bring suit against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related the story of Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he would kill him one day, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> to come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the circuit court's next term, which began in March 1826.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{reported}} that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires by train with tango singer Agustín Magaldi. However, biographers Marysa Navarro and Nicholas Fraser maintain {{that this is}} unlikely, {{as there is no}} record of the married Magaldi performing in Junín in 1934 (and, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had,</b> he usually traveled with his wife). Eva's sisters maintain that Eva traveled to Buenos Aires with their mother. The sisters also claim that Doña Juana accompanied her daughter to an audition at a radio station and arranged for Eva to live with the Bustamante family, who were friends of the Duarte family. While the method of Eva's escape from her bleak provincial surroundings is debated, she did begin a new life in Buenos Aires.|$|E

5|$|Even if the ARBiH had not {{provided}} aid, the HV {{would almost certainly}} have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK's key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK's static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military was unable to check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, holding back the HV's 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj {{for less than a}} single day. The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did not intervene militarily as Milošević did not order it to do so. <b>Even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> wished to intervene, the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.|$|E
5|$|The Nixon family {{traveled}} to Europe in 1963, where Nixon gave press conferences {{and met with}} leaders of the countries he visited. The family moved to New York City, where Nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie & Alexander. Nixon had pledged, when announcing his California campaign, not {{to run for president}} in 1964; <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not, he believed {{it would be difficult to}} defeat Kennedy, or after his assassination, Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson. In 1964, he supported Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater for the Republican nomination for president; when Goldwater was successful in gaining the nomination, Nixon was selected to introduce the candidate to the convention. Although he thought Goldwater unlikely to win, Nixon campaigned for him loyally. The election was a disaster for the Republicans; Goldwater's landslide loss to Johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in Congress and among state governors.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{extended}} the standard from Berghuis v. Thompkins in Salinas v. Texas, 570 U.S. ___ (2013), on June 17, 2013, holding that a suspect's silence {{in response to}} a specific question posed during an interview with police when the suspect was not in custody and the suspect had been voluntarily answering other questions during that interview could be used against him in court where he did not explicitly invoke his Fifth Amendment right to silence in response to the specific question. Of the five justices who concluded that the suspect's silence could be used against him in these circumstances, Justices Alito, Roberts and Kennedy concluded that the defendant's Fifth Amendment claim failed because he did not expressly invoke the privilege. The other two Justices, Thomas and Scalia, concluded that the defendant's claim would fail <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> invoked the privilege, on the theory that the prosecutor's comment at the trial—regarding the defendant's silence {{in response to a}} question during the police interview—did not compel the defendant to give self-incriminating testimony.|$|E

5|$|Thi {{publicly}} disassociated {{himself from}} the Struggle Movement. However, he remained in I Corps and was still regarded as a significant political influence and motivating factor for the Struggle Movement. Regardless of what he may have thought, the discontent against Kỳ was by then {{too much for him}} to control <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> wanted to. By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the Struggle Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the Struggle Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E

25|$|The {{principal}} accusation against Yamashita {{was that}} he had failed in his duty as commander of Japanese forces in the Philippines to prevent them from committing atrocities. The defense acknowledged that atrocities had been committed but contended that the breakdown of communications and the Japanese chain of command in the chaotic battle of the second Philippines campaign was such that Yamashita could not have controlled his troops <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> known of their actions, which was not certain in any case; furthermore, many of the atrocities had been committed by Japanese naval forces outside his command.|$|E

25|$|In 1903, {{the lines}} of study were changed to mathematical-scientific, modern-lingual, and classical-lingual, {{and the name of}} the schools was officially changed to gymnasium. From 1958 there were two lines of study, mathematical-scientific and lingual, and after first year, the {{students}} had to choose between different branches (e.g. modern languages or classical languages). This system was however changed in 1988, where the students in their second year were able to choose more freely between a variety of subjects (a student could for instance have both a language and a scientific subject at the highest level, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> originally chosen the mathematical line of study).|$|E
25|$|A {{statistical}} analysis {{of the impact of}} political contributions on individual senators' support for the public insurance option conducted by Nate Silver has suggested that Baucus was an unlikely supporter of the public option in the first place. Based on Baucus's political ideology and the per capita health care spending in Montana, Silver's model projects that there would be only a 30.6% probability of Baucus supporting a public insurance option <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> received no relevant campaign contributions. Silver calculates that the impact on Baucus of the significant campaign contributions that he has received from the health care industry further reduces the probability of his supporting a public insurance option from 30.6% to 0.6%.|$|E
25|$|Richthofen was now {{performing}} {{the duties of}} a lieutenant colonel (a wing commander in modern British Air Force terms), although he remained a captain. The system in the British army was for an officer to hold the rank appropriate to his level of command, if only on a temporary basis, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been formally promoted. In the German army, {{it was not unusual}} for a wartime officer to hold a lower rank than his duties implied; German officers were promoted according to a schedule and not by battlefield promotion. For instance, Erwin Rommel commanded an infantry battalion as a captain in 1917 and 1918. It was also the custom for a son not to hold a higher rank than his father, and Richthofen's father was a reserve major.|$|E

25|$|Ceballos {{then brought}} a section 1983 claim in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting that his {{supervisors}} violated the First Amendment by retaliating against {{him for his}} memo. His supervisors claimed {{that there was no}} retaliation, that the changes in his job were instead dictated by legitimate staffing concerns, and that regardless, Ceballos’ memo was not constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment. The District Court granted their motion for summary judgment, concluding that because Ceballos wrote his memo pursuant to the duties of his employment, he was not entitled to First Amendment protection for the memo’s contents. In the alternative, it ruled that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> a protected speech right in this context, the right was not clearly established and so qualified immunity applied to his supervisors' actions.|$|E
25|$|As Governor Bush's {{counsel in}} Texas, Gonzales also {{reviewed}} all clemency requests. A 2003 article in The Atlantic Monthly asserted that Gonzales gave insufficient counsel, {{and failed to}} second-guess convictions and failed appeals. Gonzales' deputy general counsel from 1995 to 1999, Pete Wassdorf, in turn sought to defend Gonzales from what he characterized as an inaccurate and incomplete picture of the clemency process under Bush. Under Section II, Article 4 of the Texas Constitution, the Governor cannot grant a pardon or commute a death sentence except with a majority vote recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, so Bush was constrained in granting clemency <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> wanted {{to do so in}} a case. The fact remains that only one death sentence was overturned by Governor Bush, and the state of Texas executed more prisoners during Gonzales's term than any other state.|$|E
25|$|The Clergy of the Church of England {{database}} (CCEd) has {{a record}} of Samuel Fisher's ordination as priest at Eccleshall by Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Lichfield, on 18 December 1630. The five years, 1630-5, between Fisher's ordination and his appointment as rector at Upton Magna, are largely unaccounted for. Rigg's account in the Dictionary of National Biography implies that he worked at St Bride's Church in London before coming to Shropshire: this is almost certainly untrue, as he is known to have worked there in the 1650s. Fisher's ordination by Thomas Morton seems to connect him from the outset of his career with the West Midlands and his preaching at Shrewsbury in 1633 shows that he was moderately known as a preacher in the region before his presentation to the rectory. However, it is not known how or where, or <b>even</b> <b>if,</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> an ecclesiastical living during this period.|$|E
