25|$|In 1984, a new <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{technology}} that {{makes use of}} vacuum-deposited electron-beam cross-linked acrylate materials as dielectric in film capacitors was announced as a patent in the press. But as of 2012, only one manufacturer markets a specific acrylate SMD <b>film</b> <b>capacitor,</b> as an X7R MLCC replacement.|$|E
25|$|The {{permissible}} {{pulse current}} {{capacity of a}} metallized <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> generally allows an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10 K.|$|E
25|$|<b>Film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> plastic <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> <b>film</b> {{dielectric}} <b>capacitors,</b> or polymer <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> generically called “film caps” as well {{as power}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> are electrical capacitors with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric, sometimes combined with paper as carrier of the electrodes.|$|R

25|$|Polyphenylene sulfide <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are well-suited for {{applications}} in frequency-determining circuits and for high-temperature applications. Because of their good electrical properties, PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are an ideal replacement for polycarbonate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> whose production since 2000 {{has been largely}} discontinued.|$|R
25|$|A key {{advantage}} of modern <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths to the entire electrode very short. The setup behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal ohmic losses (ESR) and the parasitic inductance (ESL). The inherent geometry of <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> structure results in very low ohmic losses and a very low parasitic inductance, which makes them especially suitable for applications with very high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} simple snubber circuit {{consists}} {{out of a}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> and a resistor in series, connected in parallel with a semiconductor component to suppress or damp undesirable voltage spikes. The capacitor absorbs the inductive turn-off peak current temporarily, so that the resulting voltage spike is limited. But the trend in modern semiconductor technology is towards higher power applications, which increases the peak currents and switching speeds. In this case, the boundary between a standard electronic <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> and a power capacitor is blurred, so that larger snubber capacitors belong more {{in the area of}} power systems, electrical installations and plants.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{electronic}} ballasts usually {{change the}} frequency of the power from a standard mains frequency of 50 or 60 Hz up to 40 kHz or higher, often using a Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit topology with Power Factor Correction (PFC). First the AC input power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component {{in the middle of the}} ballast circuit is a polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> used for PFC.|$|E
25|$|<b>Film</b> <b>{{capacitors}}</b> {{or plastic}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are non-polarized capacitors with an insulating plastic film as the dielectric. The dielectric films {{are drawn to}} a thin layer, provided with metallic electrodes and wound into a cylindrical winding. The electrodes of <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> may be metallized aluminum or zinc, applied on one or {{both sides of the}} plastic film, resulting in metallized <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> or a separate metallic foil overlying the <b>film,</b> called film/foil <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Polystyrene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "Styroflex Capacitors", were {{well known for}} many years as inexpensive <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> for general purpose applications, in which high capacitance stability, low dissipation factor and low leakage currents were needed. But because the film thickness could be not made thinner than 10nbsp&µm, and the maximum temperature ratings reached only 85nbsp&°C, the PS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> have mostly been replaced by polyester <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> as of 2012. However, some manufacturers may still offer PS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> in their production program, backed by large amounts of polystyrene film stocked in their warehouse.|$|R
25|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} capacitance of PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> over the entire temperature range is very small (±nbsp&1.5%) compared with other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Also the frequency dependence {{in the range from}} 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz of the capacitance of the PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is ±nbsp&0.5%, very low compared with other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> The dissipation factor of PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is quite small, and the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor over a wide range is very stable. Only at temperatures above 100nbsp&°C does the dissipation factor increase to larger values. The dielectric absorption performance is excellent, behind only PTFE and PS dielectric capacitors.|$|R
25|$|Film {{capacitors}} {{with their}} different plastic film material {{do have a}} small spread in the dimensions for a given capacitance/voltage value of a <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> because the minimum dielectric film thickness differs between the different film materials.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{property of}} film capacitors is {{their ability to}} withstand high peak voltage or peak current surge pulses. This capability depends on all internal connections of the <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> withstanding the peak current loads up to the maximum specified temperature. The collateral contact layers (schoopage) with the electrodes can be a potential limitation of peak current carrying capacity.|$|E
25|$|Ceramic {{and film}} {{capacitors}} are {{already out of}} their smaller capacitance values suitable for higher frequencies up to several 100nbsp&MHz. They also have significantly lower parasitic inductance, making them suitable for higher frequency applications, due to their construction with end-surface contacting of the electrodes. To increase the range of frequencies, often an electrolytic capacitor {{is connected in parallel}} with a ceramic or <b>film</b> <b>capacitor.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{temperature}} {{dependence of the}} capacitance of PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> over the entire temperature range is very small (± 1.5%) compared with other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Also the frequency dependence {{in the range from}} 100 Hz to 100 kHz of the capacitance of the PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is ± 0.5%, very low compared with other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> The dissipation factor of PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is quite small, and the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor over a wide range is very stable. Only at temperatures above 100 °C does the dissipation factor increase to larger values. The dielectric absorption performance is excellent, behind only PTFE and PS dielectric capacitors.|$|R
25|$|These {{capacitors}} {{have a low}} {{dissipation factor}} and because of their relatively temperature-independent electrical properties of about ±80nbsp&ppm over the entire temperature range, they had many applications for low-loss and temperature-stable applications such as timing circuits, precision analog circuits, and signal filters in applications with tough environmental conditions. PC <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> had been manufactured since the mid-1950s, but the main supplier of polycarbonate <b>film</b> for <b>capacitors</b> had ceased the production of this polymer in film form as of the year 2000. As a result, most of the manufacturers of polycarbonate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> worldwide had to stop their production of PC <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> and changed to polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> instead. Most of the former PC capacitor applications have found satisfactory substitutes with PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|<b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are made}} out of two pieces of plastic film covered with {{metallic}} electrodes, wound into a cylindrical shaped winding, with terminals attached, and then encapsulated. In general, <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are not polarized, so the two terminals are interchangeable. There are {{two different types of}} plastic <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> made with two different electrode configurations: ...|$|R
25|$|A related type is {{the power}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The {{materials}} and construction techniques used for large power film capacitors mostly {{are similar to those}} of ordinary film capacitors. However, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. The standardization of ordinary film capacitors is oriented on electrical and mechanical parameters. The standardization of power capacitors by contrast emphasizes the safety of personnel and equipment, as given by the local regulating authority.|$|E
25|$|A key {{advantage}} of every film capacitor's internal construction is direct contact to the electrodes {{on both ends}} of the winding. This contact keeps all current paths very short. The design behaves like a large number of individual capacitors connected in parallel, thus reducing the internal ohmic losses (ESR) and ESL. The inherent geometry of <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> structure results in low ohmic losses and a low parasitic inductance, which makes them suitable for applications with high surge currents (snubbers) and for AC power applications, or for applications at higher frequencies.|$|E
25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the capacitor. This film can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> with double-sided metallization on a polyester film carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the capacitor. Film capacitors with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|E
25|$|From simple {{beginnings}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{developed into}} a very broad and highly specialized range of different types. By {{the end of the}} 20th century mass production of most <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> had shifted to the Far East. A few large companies still produce highly specialized <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> in Europe and in the US, for power and AC applications.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dissipation}} factor of PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{is smaller than}} that of other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Due to the low and very stable {{dissipation factor}} over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650nbsp&V/µm, PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{can be used in}} metallized and in film/foil versions as capacitors for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called [...] "snubber" [...] capacitors, or in IGBT applications. In addition, polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are used in AC power applications, such as motor run capacitors or PFC capacitors.|$|R
2500|$|Two main {{advantages}} of <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are very low ESR and ESL values. <b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are physically {{larger and more}} expensive than aluminum electrolytic capacitors (e-caps), [...] but have much higher surge and pulse load capabilities. As <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are not polarized, {{they can be used}} in AC voltage applications without DC bias, and they have much more stable electrical parameters. Polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> have relatively little temperature dependence of capacitance and dissipation factor, {{so that they can be}} applied in frequency-stable Class 1 applications, replacing Class 1 ceramic capacitors.|$|R
25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET film capacitors {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of polyester film capacitors is relatively high compared to other film capacitors, ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of polyester film capacitors compared with the other film capacitors is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for polyester film capacitors compared with the other <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> types.|$|E
2500|$|A related {{component}} type is {{the power}} (<b>film)</b> <b>capacitor.</b> Although the materials and construction techniques used for large power film capacitors {{are very similar to}} those used for ordinary film capacitors, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. As modern electronic equipment gained the capacity to handle power levels that were previously the exclusive domain of [...] "electrical power" [...] components, the distinction between the [...] "electronic" [...] and [...] "electrical" [...] power ratings has become less distinct. [...] In the past, the boundary between these two families was approximately at a reactive power of 200volt-amperes, [...] but modern power electronics can handle increasing amounts of power.|$|E
2500|$|For metallized film capacitors, {{the maximum}} {{possible}} pulse voltage is limited {{because of the}} limited current-carrying capacity between contact of the electrodes and the electrodes themselves. The rated pulse voltage Vp is the peak value of the pulse voltage which may be applied continuously to a capacitor at the rated temperature and at a given frequency. The pulse voltage capacity is given as pulse voltage rise time dV/dT in V/µs and also implies the maximum pulse current capacity. The values on the pulse rise time refer to the rated voltage. [...] For lower operating voltages, the permissible pulse rise times may decrease. The permissible pulse load capacity of a <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> is generally calculated so that an internal temperature rise of 8 to 10°K is acceptable.|$|E
25|$|The {{change of}} {{capacitance}} for P100 and N470 Class 1 ceramic capacitors {{is lower than}} 1%, for capacitors with N750 to N1500 ceramics it is ≤2%. <b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> may lose capacitance due to self-healing processes or gain it due to humidity influences. Typical changes over 2 years at 40°C are, for example, ±3% for PE <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> and ±1% PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Polyethylene naphthalate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> using a {{dielectric}} {{made of the}} thermoplastic biaxial polymer material polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), {{trade names}} Kaladex®, Teonex®. [...] They are produced only as metallized types. PEN, like PET, belongs to the polyester family, but has better stability at high temperatures. Therefore, PEN <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are more suitable for}} high temperature applications and for SMD packaging.|$|R
25|$|Polyphenylene sulfide <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> with {{dielectric}} {{made of the}} thermoplastic, organic, {{and partially}} crystalline polymer material Poly(p-phenylene sulfide) (PPS), trade name Torelina. They are only produced as metallized types.|$|R
2500|$|Polyimide (PI), a {{thermoplastic}} polymer of imide monomers, {{is proposed}} for film capacitors called Polyimide-, PI- or Kapton capacitors. Kapton is the trade name of polyimide from DuPont. This material {{is of interest}} because its high temperature resistance up to 400nbsp&°C. But as of 2012, no specific PI capacitor series film capacitors have been announced. The offered <b>film</b> <b>capacitor,</b> Kapton CapacitorCL11, announced from “dhgate” is a “Type: Polypropylene Film Capacitor”. Another very strange Kapton capacitor {{can be found at}} YEC, a Chinese producer of capacitors. [...] Here the announced “Kapton capacitors” are in reality supercapacitors, a completely different technology Perhaps the Kapton film in these supercapacitors is used as a separator between the electrodes of this double-layer capacitor. [...] Kapton films are often offered as an adhesive film for the outer insulation of capacitor packages.|$|E
2500|$|The {{rated voltage}} of {{different}} film materials depends on {{factors such as}} the thickness of the film, the quality of the material (freedom from physical defects and chemical impurities), the ambient temperature, and frequency of operation, plus a safety margin against the breakdown voltage (dielectric strength). But to a first approximation, the voltage rating of a <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> depends primarily on the thickness of the plastic film. For example, with the minimum available film thickness of polyester film capacitors (about 0.7µm), it is possible to produce capacitors with a rated voltage of 400VDC. If higher voltages are needed, typically a thicker plastic film will be used. [...] But the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually nonlinear. For thicknesses greater than about 5 mils, the breakdown voltage only increases approximately with the square-root of the film thickness. On the other hand, the capacitance decreases linearly with increased film thickness. [...] For reasons of availability, storage and existing processing capabilities, it is desirable to achieve higher breakdown voltages while using existing available film materials. This can be achieved by a one-sided partial metallization of the insulating films in such a manner that an internal series connection of capacitors is produced. By using this series connection technique, the total breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor, but the total capacitance is also reduced by the same factor.|$|E
50|$|Cost of a PPS <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{is usually}} higher {{compared}} to a PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitor.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{dissipation}} factor of PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{is smaller than}} that of other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Due to the low and very stable {{dissipation factor}} over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650 V/µm, PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{can be used in}} metallized and in film/foil versions as capacitors for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called [...] "snubber" [...] capacitors, or in IGBT applications. In addition, polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are used in AC power applications, such as motor run capacitors or PFC capacitors.|$|R
25|$|Most EMI/RFI {{suppression}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are metallized polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> However, {{some types}} of metallized paper capacitors (MP) are still used for this application, because they still have some advantages in flame resistance.|$|R
25|$|However, since {{almost every}} major {{manufacturer}} offers its own proprietary <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> with mixed <b>film</b> materials, {{it is difficult}} to give a universal and general overview of the specific properties of mixed <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b>|$|R
