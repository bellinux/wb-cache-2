GREF—the execution force—under the Ministry of Defence, officers from Indian Army Corps of Engineers, who are posted to GREF on ERE [...]The status of GREF {{is equivalent to}} that of JAKLI in the Indian Army. The GREF includes civil, electrical, mechanical engineers Administrative Officers Medical Officers and Hindi Officers. Engineers are selected from engineering colleges across India through the Indian Engineering Services examination conducted by the Union Public Service Commission. Other Officers also includes administrative officers, medical officers who are also selected through UPSC and placed under Army act 1950 and Army rules 1954 with exceptions and modifications vide SRO 329 and 330 of 1960 and SRO 1001 of 1961 for equivalent ranks of GREF with regular army. Members of GREF are the members of Armed Forces within meaning of Article 33 of the Constitution of India {{as defined by the}} Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of R. Viswan V/S Union of India and the President declared GREF as integral part of armed forces. Members of GREF are entitled to ration at par with regular army and drawing from ASC units located nearest to GREF units.Members of GREF will continue to remain members of Armed Forces even if they are governed by CCS ( [...] CCA [...] ) Rules 1965. A question arose in respect of R. Viswan v/s Union of India 1983,"WHETHER <b>Genral</b> Reserve Engineering Force is an armed force—The question is whether Sec 21 of the Army Act, 1950, read with Chapter1V of the Army Rules,1954 is within scope and ambit of Article 33 of the Constitution and if it is, whether Central Government notification Nos S.R.O. 329 and 330 dated 23 September 1960 making inter alia Sec 21 of the Army Act, 1950 and Chapter 1v of the Army Rules, 1954 applicable to General Reserve Engineering Force are ultra-vires of that Article since the General Reserve Engineering Force is neither an armed Force nor a Force charged with the maintenance of public order. It is a question of some importance since it affects the fundamental rights of large number of persons belonging to the General Reserve Engineering Force and in order to arrive at a correct decision of this question, it is necessary first of all to consider the true nature and character of the General Reserve Engineering Force. It is indisputable on the facts and circumstances that the function and duties of GREF are integrally connected with the operation plans and requirement of the Armed Forces and the members of GREF are integral to the Armed Forces. There {{can be no doubt that}} without the efficient and disciplined operational role of GREF the military operations in border areas during peace as well as in times of war will be seriously hampered and a highly disciplined and efficient GREF is absolutely essential for supporting the operational plans and meeting the operational requirements of the Armed Forces. It must, therefore be held that the members of GREF answer the description of the members of Armed Forces within meaning of Art. 33 and consequently the application of Sec. 21 of the Army Act 1950, to the members of GREF must be held to be protected by that Article and the Fundamental Rights of the members of GREF must be held to be validly restricted by Sec. 21 of Army Act 1950 read with Rules 19 to 21 of Army Rules 1954. If that be so, the petitioners were liable to be charged under Sec. 63 of the Army Act 1950 for the alleged violation of Rules 19 to 21 of Army Rules 1954 and their convictions by the Court-martial as also subsequent dismissal must be held to be valid.Chief Engineers of GREF have been empowered by means of issuing them A1 and A3 warrants by Chief of Army Staff and The Central government respectively for convening GCM and confirming findings and sentence [...] GREF Officers can also punish members of Regular Army under Ministry Of Defence SRO 1001 of dated 20 May 1961 as amended up to date.|$|E
