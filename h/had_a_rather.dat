The Shogunate initially <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> strong edge in warships, and it had the vision to order the state-of-the-art French-made Kotetsu, although the ship was blocked from delivery by foreign powers on ground of neutrality once the conflict had started, and was ultimately remitted to the Imperial faction shortly after the Battle of Toba–Fushimi.|$|E

5|$|Montalbán said in promotional {{interviews}} {{for the film}} he realized early on in his career that a good villain does not see himself as villainous. The villain may do villainous things, but he feels that he is doing them for righteous reasons. Montalbán further stated he always {{tried to find a}} flaw in the character, as no one is completely good or completely evil; while Khan <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> distorted view of reality and therefore performed acts of evil, he still felt that his vengeance was a noble cause because of the death of his wife. Khan quotes the character of Ahab from Moby-Dick throughout the film, driving home his lust to make Kirk pay for the wrongs he has inflicted upon him.|$|E
5|$|The 1980Atlantic {{hurricane}} season <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> slow beginning, {{with only one}} tropical depression developing prior to the month of August. In contrast, August was an active month, with five tropical cyclones forming, three of which became hurricanes. During that month, Hurricane Allen became the earliest known Category5 hurricane on August5, a record later broken by only Hurricane Emily on July16, 2005. September also had five tropical cyclones, all of which became named storms. Tropical cyclogenesis abruptly halted in October, with only Hurricane Ivan developing in that month. However, the month of November {{was considered to be}} very active, with three storms forming during that month. Two of the systems became named storms, a record that was tied with 1932, 1969, and 1994, but later surpassed when three tropical storms existed in the Atlantic in November2001 and November2005.|$|E
5|$|The first naturalists who {{investigated}} Megalosaurus mistook it for {{a gigantic}} lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded {{that it was no}} longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing Megalosaurus with its direct relatives in the Megalosauridae, were able to obtain a more accurate picture. Megalosaurus was about seven metres long, weighing about 1.1 tonnes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. Megalosaurus <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.|$|E

25|$|Darden <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>rather</b> {{idiosyncratic}} term he used {{to describe}} the underside, substratum of architecture (and certainly this applied to anything in general), which he termed the underbelly.

Superior pilot training was to give the Israeli Air Force an unbeatable edge over their Egyptian opponents.
