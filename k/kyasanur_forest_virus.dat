40|$|<b>Kyasanur</b> <b>Forest</b> disease <b>virus</b> (KFDV) is {{enzootic}} to India {{and maintained}} in ticks, mammals, and birds. It causes severe febrile illness in humans and was first recognized in 1957 {{associated with a}} high number of deaths among monkeys in <b>Kyasanur</b> <b>Forest.</b> Genetic analysis of 48 viruses isolated in India during 1957 – 2006 showed low diversity (1. 2 %). Bayesian coalescence analysis of these sequences and those of KFDVs from Saudi Arabia and the People’s Republic of China estimated that KFDVs have evolved at a mean rate of ≈ 6. 4 × 10 – 4 substitutions/site/year, which is similar to rates estimated for mosquito-borne flaviviruses. KFDVs were estimated to have shared a common ancestor in ≈ 1942, fifteen years before identification of the disease in India. These data are consistent with the view that KFD represented a newly emerged disease when first recognized. Recent common ancestry of KFDVs from India and Saudi Arabia, despite their large geographic separation, indicates long-range movement of virus, possibly by birds. <b>Kyasanur</b> <b>Forest</b> disease <b>virus</b> (KFDV) {{is a member of the}} mammalian tick-borne virus group (previously referred to as the tick-borne encephalitis serogroup) of the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus (1).

50|$|This {{species is}} of {{interest}} because of the pathogens it carries, and its salivary apyrases which prevent platelet activation and aggregation, that is, blood-clotting.

The closely related <b>Kyasanur</b> <b>Forest</b> disease <b>virus</b> (KFDV) is endemic to certain regions of India.

40|$|Tick-borne encephalitis, or TBE, {{is a human}} viral {{infectious}} disease involving the central nervous system. TBE {{is caused by the}} tick- borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), {{a member of the family}} Flaviviridae, and was initially isolated in 1937. Three virus sub-types are described: European or Western tick-borne encephalitis virus, Siberian tick-borne encephalitis virus, and Far eastern Tick-borne encephalitis virus (formerly known as Russian Spring Summer encephalitis virus, RSSEV). The family Flaviviridae includes several tick-borne viruses affecting humans.

40|$|Background: <b>Kyasanur</b> <b>Forest</b> disease <b>virus</b> (KFDV) and Alkhurma {{hemorrhagic fever}} virus (AHFV) {{are closely related}} members of the Flavivirus genus and are {{important}} causes of human disease in India and the Arabian Peninsula, respectively. Despite high genetic similarity, the viruses have distinctly different host ranges and ecologies. Human cases of KFDV or AHFV develop a spectrum of disease syndromes ranging from liver pathology to neurologic disease. Case reports suggest KFDV is more commonly associated with hepatic and gastrointestinal manifestations whereas AHFV is more commonly associated with neurologic disease. Methodology/Principal Findings: Inoculation of three immunocompetent laboratory mouse strains revealed that KFDV was consistently more lethal than AHFV. In subsequent studies utilizing C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, we demonstrated that KFDV infection was associated with higher viral loads and significantly higher mortality. KFDV-infected mice rapidly developed more severe disease than AHFV-infected mice, as evidenced by significant abnormalities on clinical chemistry panels and more severe pathology {{in the brain and}} gastrointestinal tract. Conclusions/Significance: Infections of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice with KFDV or AHFV resulted in clinical disease syndromes that closely approximate the diseases seen in human cases. Despite high genetic similarity, there were clear differences in survival, viral kinetics, clinical chemistry data and histology. These results suggest that distinct mouse models for AHFV an...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundAlkhurma {{hemorrhagic fever}} <b>virus</b> (AHFV) and <b>Kyasanur</b> <b>forest</b> disease <b>virus</b> (KFDV) cause {{significant}} human disease and mortality in Saudi Arabia and India, respectively. Despite their distinct geographic ranges, AHFV and KFDV share a remarkably high sequence identity. Given its emergence decades after KFDV, AHFV {{has since been}} considered a variant of KFDV and thought to have arisen from an introduction of KFDV to Saudi Arabia from India. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the evolutionary history of AHFV and KFDV, we analyzed the full length genomes of 16 AHFV and 3 KFDV isolates. Methodology/Principal FindingsViral genomes were sequenced and compared to two AHFV sequences available in GenBank. Sequence analyses revealed higher genetic diversity within AHFVs isolated from ticks than human AHFV isolates. A Bayesian coalescent phylogenetic analysis demonstrated an ancient divergence of AHFV and KFDV of approximately 700 years ago. Conclusions/SignificanceThe high sequence diversity within tick populations and the presence of competent tick vectors in the surrounding regions, coupled with the recent identification of AHFV in Egypt, indicate possible viral range expansion or a larger geographic range than previously thought. The divergence of AHFV from KFDV nearly 700 years ago suggests other AHFV/KFDV-like viruses might exist in the regions between Saudi Arabia and India. Given the human morbidity and mortality associated with these viruses, these results emphasize the importance of more focused study of these significant public health threats...|$|R
