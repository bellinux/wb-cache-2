He elaborated on his direction for the album in an interview for The National, saying that [...] "I think I'd have been in a bad position if I tried to recreate the same energy as I did on Cosmogramma - like, go in further. <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>we</b> pull back, try to do something that gets to the core of the emotional sentiment.

5000|$|When Elton John {{ended his}} tour in 1989, Guy Babylon {{introduced}} Bob to the pinball wizard's longtime guitar slinger, Davey Johnstone. At that time, Davey, Guy, and longtime John drummer Nigel Olsson {{were about to}} make a record together and asked Bob to join them. They named their band Warpipes, and their album debuted in 1990. Everyone who heard the album loved it, but it was met with the usual management and record company obstacles. The project stalled, and Guy and Davey were called to begin John's The One album in Paris. A bit discouraged but never losing his drive, Bob proceeded to once again hit the streets to find more playing opportunities. As ‘The One’ tour was about to begin, Elton asked legendary bassist Pino Palladino to join him. Pino was forced to decline because his wife was scheduled to give birth. Elton asked Davey Johnstone if he knew any bassists who could fill the spot and Davey replied by saying, [...] "We’ve been playing with this cat Bob Birch in LA. <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>we</b> give him a try?" [...] On February 14, 1992, Elton agreed and asked Davey to call Bob, which began what the Detroit born bassist calls ‘sideman heaven’. When asked about his new spot in Elton’s group he always responded that he ‘couldn't ask for a better gig’. Birch continued to respond after being asked about his feelings on joining Elton’s band by stating, “Not only is the music fantastic, but the bass lines are classic and Elton is a gem. He is like family; I love him dearly and truly value our personal and musical relationship with all of my heart". Being Elton's touring and primary recording bassist obviously opened up more avenues for Birch in his musical career. Once again, in between gigs with Elton, Bob was back in L.A. looking for even more playing opportunities.|$|E
5000|$|On February 24, 2016, West stated on Twitter {{that he was}} {{planning}} to release another album in the summer of 2016, tentatively called Turbo Grafx 16 in reference to the 1990s video game console of the same name. On June 3, 2016, West premiered the first single [...] "Champions" [...] off the GOOD Music album Cruel Winter, which was six minutes and featured Travis Scott, Big Sean, Gucci Mane, Desiigner, Yo Gotti, Quavo, and 2 Chainz. He told the radio host, Big Boy, that the beat had been in works {{for a year and a}} half. In June, West released a controversial video for [...] "Famous," [...] which depicted wax figures of several celebrities (including West, Kardashian, Taylor Swift, president and businessman Donald Trump, comedian Bill Cosby, and former president George W. Bush) sleeping nude in a shared bed. In August 2016, West embarked on the Saint Pablo Tour in support of The Life of Pablo. The performances featured a mobile stage suspended from the ceiling. West postponed several dates in October following the Paris robbery of his wife Kim Kardashian. On November 21, 2016, West cancelled the remaining 21 dates on the Saint Pablo Tour, following a week of no-shows, curtailed concerts and rants about politics. He was later admitted for psychiatric observation at UCLA Medical Center. He stayed hospitalized over the Thanksgiving weekend stemming from a temporary psychosis stemming from sleep deprivation and extreme dehydration. The current West seems to be based on trying to create a world that he wants his daughter, North, to grow up in. In an interview for Paper West states that all that time, all the seemingly sporadic actions and outbursts, he was fighting for his daughter Nori’s future “‘Lets just tap back into the real world for a second we can have children. Let’s be thankful, we can raise our kids, let’s be thankful. But <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>we</b> raise our kids in a truthful world, not a world based on brands and concepts of perception? Perception is not reality. When I look in Norths eyes, Im happy about every mistake Ive ever made. Im happy that I fought to bring some type of reality to this world we choose to stay in right now, driven by brands and corporations." ...|$|E

40|$|Four {{works were}} {{exhibited}} {{as part of}} the group exhibition DIE AUSSTELLUNG: Rest/less; That moment when information brushes up against information; <b>How</b> <b>about</b> <b>we</b> take a minute to question where this truly resides?; and (re) Source(d) Material. The exhibition was primarily a staging of exhibiting. It dealt with the structures, practices and conventions of the presentation of art. Over a period of four weeks, the exhibition space was transformed into a site for production, that constantly transformed. Artistic works were created, set and documented in scene. The visitors observed each of the show moments in a process - individual elements were combined to form an overall structure {{during the course of the}} exhibition. The exhibition also explored the possibility and reception of aesthetic practice, the relationship of parts to the whole, of real time experience and mediated communication. For the final opening on 20 September, the catalog for the exhibition was published by Walther König. The catalog does not take on the same format as the exhibition. The catalog shares a version of the exhibition. It is the simulation of the exhibition. The exhibition was a work of the two artists Alexander Basile and Alwin Lay. Initiated by Gertrud Peters and Mischa Kuball in cooperation with the - 1 / MinusEins experimental laboratory. The exhibition featured the work of 19 international practitioners: BASTIAN HOFFMANN (Köln), PETER HERMANS (Leipzig), BALZ ISLER (Berlin), JAMES NIZAM (Toronto), JAN HOEFT (Köln), STÉPHANIE SOLINAS (Paris), VERENA SEIBT & CLEA STRACKE (München), MIA BOYSEN (Köln), TAIYO ONORATO & NICO KREBS (Berlin/ Zürich), IAN DE RUITER (Amsterdam), PAUL BAILEY (London/Ireland), PETER MILLER (Paris), DANIEL NIGGEMANN (Hamburg), RHEIN VERLAG (Düsseldorf), ARNE SCHMITT (Leipzig), JOHANNES POST (Köln), MARK VON SCHLEGELL (Köln/Los Angeles), FLEUR VAN DODEWAARD (Rotterdam), BERNHARD CELLA (Wien...|$|E
40|$|Growing out versus filling in: <b>how</b> <b>about</b> <b>we</b> all grow up? By Chris Ives, RMIT University and Cecily Maller, RMIT University It’s {{a debate}} that’s been raging {{for decades and}} dominates {{academic}} and popular urban planning discourse: urban sprawl versus urban densification. Is it better to increase density or to expand at the edges? Each camp has its fervent supporters and truckloads of data to back themselves. The enduring nature of the debate suggests that we’ve reached a stalemate that {{is unlikely to be}} broken by proponents of either side simply shouting louder. This is not a simple black and white argument, and there are often unacknowledged trade-offs that arise when one stance is pitched against the other. Food production Concern about the loss of traditional farmland for urban development has been growing in recent times in Australia. Media and academia alike have warned of a threat to food security as cities rely increasingly on mass-produced agricultural products from distant Australian and international producers. Concern over food miles has led many commentators to call for greater protection of peri-urban agricultural land. Simultaneously there are calls for the growth of urban agriculture. Food produced within the urban matrix can occur in high density urban contexts, but it’s perhaps most effective in low-density suburban areas where backyards offer ample space. Designing cities to maximise urban agriculture may therefore have the perverse outcome of the expansion of city boundaries into traditional farmland. Human health and well-being The recent focus on neighbourhood design and its role in supporting health and well-being has also made its way into the debate about density. For example, low density arrangements usually provide better access to nature through the greater availability of (public and private) green space. Green space is important for exercise and social interaction, while contact with nature more broadly can improve mental well-being and provide psychological restoration. However, due to their distance from the city centre, low density suburbs can be isolating. They often lack services and involve long commuting times; all of which have negative impacts on health (for example increasing sedentary behaviour). Although high density neighbourhoods can address many of these issues, they also have their own problems: noise and air pollution, traffic congestion, fear of crime and a deficit of green open space. In short, there is no right or wrong answer, since different aspects of health and well-being are accommodated more easily by high and low density urban arrangements.   Perth as viewed from NASA’s International Space Station.
