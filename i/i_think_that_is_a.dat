2500|$|U.N. {{inspectors}} {{had identified}} many United States manufactured items {{that had been}} exported from the United States to Iraq under licenses issued by the Department of Commerce, and [...] that these items were used to further Iraq's chemical and nuclear weapons development and its missile delivery system development programs. ... The executive branch of our government approved 771 different export licenses for sale of dual-use technology to Iraq. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> devastating record.|$|E

[...] He added, [...] "...Fate dealt us this card, and I don't think we've done particularly badly with it. Music today seems so very worthy, so very dull. Nobody wants to stick their neck out any more, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> great pity. We did, and we left our mark." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a paper {{published}} in 1988, John S. Michael reported that Samuel G. Morton's original 19th-century {{study was conducted}} with less bias than Gould had described; that [...] "contrary to Gould's interpretation ... Morton's research was conducted with integrity". Nonetheless, Michael's analysis suggested that there were discrepancies in Morton's craniometric calculations, that his data tables were scientifically unsound, and he [...] "cannot be excused for his errors, or his unfair comparisons of means". Michael later complained that some authors, including J. Philippe Rushton, selectively [...] "cherry-picked facts" [...] from his research to support their own claims. He lamented, [...] "Some people have turned the Morton-Gould affair into a all or nothing debate in which either one side is right or the other side is right, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mistake. Both men made mistakes and proving one wrong does not prove the other one right." ...|$|E

60|$|JUNO. Yes: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> {{properly}} speaking, {{a married}} woman's duty.|$|R

2500|$|During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Palin {{expressed}} {{support for}} a two-state solution to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, pledged to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and reiterated her support for Israel's survival. Specifically, Palin stated that [...] "Israel is our strongest and best ally in the Middle East. We have got to assure them that we will never allow a second Holocaust, despite, again, warnings from Iran and any other country that would seek to destroy Israel, {{that that is what}} they would like to see. We will support Israel. A two-state solution, building our embassy, also, in Jerusalem, those things that we look forward to being able to accomplish, with this peace-seeking nation, and they have a track record of being able to forge these peace agreements." [...] Regarding Joe Biden's support for Israel, Palin stated that [...] "I'm so encouraged to know that we both love Israel, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good thing to get to agree on, Senator Biden. I respect your position on that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> record performance. Of {{course you}} are all looking forward to your first skirmish; I can assure you we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, if you like, I {{will take}} her that ring. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very generous offer on my part, for I {{do not like}} the responsibility." ...|$|E
60|$|Oh, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{too high}} for them; we have never paid over fifty cents a bunch.|$|R
60|$|KATHERINE. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{just what}} he might be. [Going to the window] We shall know soon.|$|R
60|$|GIRL. Look here! We haf {{one life}} each, and soon it <b>is</b> over. Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> lucky.|$|R
6000|$|... "We shall {{all want}} to learn of you--I, at least," [...] said Gwendolen. [...] "I sing very badly, as Herr Klesmer will tell you,"--here she glanced upward to that higher power rather archly, and continued--"but I have been rebuked for not liking to middling, since I can be nothing more. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{different}} doctrine from yours?" [...] She was still looking at Klesmer, who said quickly-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{praying that}} you'll {{never be able}} to eat a bitter apple without making a face," [...] she said. [...] "He told Felicity and Felicity told me. She said she thought it was real cute of him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dreadful way to talk about praying and I told her so. She wanted me to promise not to tell you, but I wouldn't promise, because I think it's fair for you to know what is going on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that all?" [...] asked Teacher. Then {{without waiting}} for a reply he added, [...] "It {{is because of the}} way Mrs. Teacher and I build our nest. Some people think it is like an oven and so they call us Oven Birds. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> silly name myself, quite as silly as Golden Crowned Thrush, which is what some people call me. I'm not a Thrush. I'm not even related to the Thrush family. I'm a Warbler, a Wood Warbler." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, quite satisfactorily, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> <b>That</b> <b>is</b> my new servant. Count Piper has {{appointed}} him. He speaks Swedish and Polish." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> no slouch of a compliment--kind of a dim {{religious}} light about it. I {{enjoy that}} sort of thing.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Basil, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{the sweetest}} and {{simplest}} and kindest creature in the world, and I'm perfectly {{in love with}} her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Building!" [...] I interrupted. [...] "Nonsense! The annex I am {{thinking}} of is quite different; and yet not altogether so, either. Walkirk, don't you think that a man in my position could do {{a great deal to}} help those sisters in their good work? Don't you think that he could act as an outside collaborator? I am sure there are many things he could do which might not be suitable for them to do, or which they might not want to do. For instance, this business that has taken Mother Anastasia to Washington. Perhaps it is something that she hates to do, and I might have done as well as not. I have a mind to propose to her to go in and take all this sort of thing off the hands of the sisters. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> good practical idea, and it is very natural that I should wish to propose it to her at the very time she is engaged in this outside business." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{benefits}} he acquires {{in such a}} {{place are}} not of a selfish kind, but extend themselves to his home, and to those whom it contains. Something of what he hears or reads within such walls can scarcely fail to become at times a topic of discourse by his own fireside, nor can it ever fail to lead to larger sympathies with man, and to a higher veneration for the great Creator of all the wonders of this universe. It appears to his home and his homely feeling in other ways; for at certain times he carries there his wife and daughter, or his sister, or, possibly, some bright-eyed acquaintance of a more tender description. Judging from what I see before me, I think it is very likely; I am sure I would if I could. He takes her there to enjoy a pleasant evening, to be gay and happy. Sometimes it may possibly happen that he dates his tenderness from the Athenaeum. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very excellent thing, too, and not the least among the advantages of the institution. In any case, I am sure the number of bright eyes and beaming faces which grace this meeting to-night by their presence, will never be among the least of its excellences in my recollection.|$|E
6000|$|... "They can't {{change their}} {{candidate}} {{in that way}} at a day's notice. You would be throwing Gresham over, and, if you ask me, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> thing {{you have no right}} to do. This objection of yours is sentimental, and there is nothing of which a man should be so much in dread as sentimentalism. It is not your fault that you oppose Mr. Lopez. You were in the field first, and you must go on with it." [...] John Fletcher, when he spoke in this way, was, at Longbarns, always supposed to be right; and on the present occasion he, as usual, prevailed. Then Arthur Fletcher wrote his letter to the lady. He would not have liked to have had it known that the composition and copying of that little note had cost him an hour. He had wished that she should understand his feelings, and yet it was necessary that he should address her in words that should be perfectly free from affection or emotion. He must let her know that, though he wrote to her, the letter was for her husband as well as for herself, and he must do this in a manner which would not imply any fear that his writing to her would be taken amiss. The letter when completed was at any rate simple and true; and yet, as we know, it was taken very much amiss.|$|E
6000|$|MRS. COADE (undoubtedly hopeful). We mustn't be too sure, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> it. (Primly.) What <b>is</b> {{it exactly}} <b>that</b> you want, Mr. Coade? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We bought, sir; {{this is a}} joint expedition. Then {{there is}} the basin and a pail. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> the total of our belongings." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If {{they want}} a drawing-teacher I'll offer myself, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{regularly}} splendid,' said Matilda warmly, as Livy paused for breath after her harangue.|$|R
5000|$|Howard Schmidt, an American {{cybersecurity}} expert, {{argued in}} March 2010 that [...] "there is no cyberwar... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> terrible metaphor and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> terrible concept. There are no winners in that environment." ...|$|E
5000|$|It is just {{assuming}} {{that if a}} company is from the Middle East it is de facto disqualified from investing in the United States, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> terrible message to send.|$|E
5000|$|... "After Dark is {{far better}} because it allows people to go over all sorts of stages in a {{discussion}} {{and they are not}} shut off. Well I suppose they are on for three or four hours, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> really good idea, that you can really work everything out for yourself." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A man of {{the name}} of Simmons, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> was the {{principal}} in the transaction. At least, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the name on the bill of sale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I will not; and I {{do believe}} <b>that</b> you <b>are</b> {{laughing}} at me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> very unkind;" [...] and she marched on in silence.|$|R

5000|$|Despite holding such an {{influential}} {{position in the}} American Library Association, Gorman {{has made it clear}} that many of his criticisms are personal and not representative of the ALA. For example, on technology and the Google digitisation, Gorman says: “The Google project has been enthusiastically embraced and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mistake. I am not speaking on behalf of the ALA. That has no position on the Google digitisation project. I, on the other hand, do.” ...|$|E
