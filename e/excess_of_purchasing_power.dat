40|$|Economists {{and policymakers}} in the Soviet Union before its {{dissolution}} {{were concerned about}} the growth of the"ruble overhang. "The concern was that the rationing of consumer goods evident in prior years had led to an <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> in households. Price liberalization was expected to lead to a jump in consumer prices as households tried to exercise their purchasing power. But after the Soviet Union dissolved, a new concern emerged: a ruble shortage. Throughout the ruble currency area, governments and state enterprises could not get enough rubles to pay wages and pensions. As a result, households were unable to make the purchases they wanted to make. Ruble shortages contributed greatly to the progressive deterioration of the ruble area, from its beginning with fifteen members to its present membership of two. The names given to these two episodes - the"ruble overhang"and the"ruble shortage"- are misleading, because they are both manifestations of the same phenomenon. In both cases, forced savings led to a reduction in purchasing power and downward pressure on inflation. The difference was in the mechanism that induced forced saving. For the ruble overhang, the government maintained price rigidity; there was nonprice rationing of output that was insufficient to satisfy demand at those rigid prices. For the ruble shortage, the government - through the de facto inconvertibility of deposits to currency. The result was the same: a rationed household sector unable to trade financial assets for commodities.

40|$|<b>Purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity, nontraded {{prices and}} the terms of trade by Kathryn Matthews* This paper argues that the {{essential}} problem underlying the failure of empirical tests <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity may be the loss of information that arises from aggregation of prices. A disaggregated specification <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity is proposed and a measure of nontraded goods prices based on a broad theoretical definition of prices and tradable goods is developed. This measure is tested empirically against other proxies {{found in the literature}} in the context <b>of</b> the <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity model <b>of</b> the bilateral Australian dollar/US dollar exchange rate. It is concluded that relative nontraded goods {{prices and the}} terms of trade {{play an important role in}} causing deviations away from <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> parity. Furthermore, the measure on nontraded prices proposed appears to provide more sensible estimates of the long run coefficients compared with other proxies used in the literature...|$|R

5000|$|Under a {{historical}} cost-based system of accounting, inflation leads to two basic problems. First, {{many of the}} historical numbers appearing on financial statements are not economically relevant because prices have changed since they were incurred. Second, since the numbers on financial statements represent dollars expended at different points of time and, in turn, embody different amounts <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>power,</b> they are simply not additive. Hence, adding cash of $10,000 held on December 31, 2002, with $10,000 representing the cost of land acquired in 1955 (when the price level was significantly lower) is a dubious operation because of the significantly different amount <b>of</b> <b>purchasing</b> <b>power</b> represented by the two numbers.|$|R
