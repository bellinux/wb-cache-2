40|$|It is {{important}} for compilers to generate executable code that is as small as possible, particularly when generating code for embedded systems. One method of reducing code size is to use instruction set architectures (ISAs) that support combining multiple operations into single operations. The ARM ISA allows for combining multiple memory operations to contiguous memory addresses into a single operation. The LLVM compiler contains a specific memory optimization to perform this combining of memory operations, called ARMLoadStoreOpt. This optimization, however, relies on another optimization (ARMPreAllocLoadStoreOpt) to move <b>eligible</b> memory <b>operations</b> into proximity in order to perform properly. This mover optimization occurs before register allocation, while ARMLoadStoreOpt occurs after register allocation. This thesis implements a similar mover optimization (called MagnetPass) after register allocation is performed, and compares this implementation with the existing optimization. While {{in most cases the}} two optimizations provide comparable results, our implementation in its current state requires some improvements before it will be a viable alternative to the existing optimization. Specifically, the algorithm will need to be modified to reduce computational complexity, and our implementation will need to take care not to interfere with other LLVM optimizations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Anterior open {{treatment}} of the inguinal hernia with a tension free mesh has reduced the incidence of recurrence and direct postoperative pain. The Lichtenstein procedure rules nowadays as reference technique for hernia treatment. Not recurrences but chronic pain is the main postoperative complication in inguinal hernia repair after Lichtenstein's technique. Preliminary experiences with a soft mesh placed in the preperitoneal space showed good results and less chronic pain. Methods The TULIP is a double-blind randomised controlled trial in which 300 patients will be randomly allocated to anterior inguinal hernia repair according to Lichtenstein or the transinguinal preperitoneal technique with soft mesh.

The primary endpoint will be direct postoperative- and chronic pain. Secondary endpoints are operation time, postoperative complications, hospital stay, costs, return to daily activities (e. g. work) and recurrence. Both groups will be evaluated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Anterior open {{treatment}} of the inguinal hernia with a tension-free mesh has reduced the incidence of hernia recurrence. The Lichtenstein procedure is the current reference technique for inguinal hernia treatment. Chronic pain has become the main postoperative complication after surgical inguinal hernia repair, especially following Lichtenstein. Preliminary experiences with a soft mesh positioned in the preperitoneal space (PPS) by transinguinal preperitoneal (TIPP) or total extraperitoneal (TEP) technique, showed promising results considering the reduction of postoperative chronic pain. Evolution of surgical innovations for inguinal hernia repair led to an open, direct approach with preperitoneal mesh position, such as TIPP. Based on the TIPP procedure, another preperitoneal repair has been recently developed, the transrectus sheath preperitoneal (TREPP) mesh repair. METHODS: The ENTREPPMENT trial is a multicentre randomized clinical trial. Patients will be randomly allocated to anterior inguinal hernia repair according to the TREPP mesh repair or TIPP procedure. All patients with a primary unilateral inguinal hernia, <b>eligible</b> for <b>operation,</b> will be {{invited to participate in}} the trial. The primary outcome measure will be the number of patients with postoperative chronic pain. Secondary outcome measures will be serious adverse events (SAEs), including recurrence, hemorrhage, return to daily activities (for example work), operative time and hospital stay. Alongside the trial health status, an economic evaluation will be performed. To demonstrate that inguinal hernia repair according to the TREPP technique reduces the percentage of patients with postoperative chronic pain from 12 % to < 6 %, a sample size of 800 patients is required (two-sided test, alpha = 0. 05, 80 % power). The ENTREPPMENT trial aims to evaluate the TREPP and TIPP procedures from patients' perspective. It is hypothesized that the TREPP technique may reduce the number of patients with any form of postoperative chronic pain by 50 % compared to the TIPP procedure.
