5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised over fresh plots to liberate Edward, some involving the Dominican order and former household knights, and one such attempt got {{at least as far}} as breaking into the prison within the castle.

60|$|Evelyn {{was dressed}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>latest</b> <b>summer</b> fashion, and <b>the</b> thin, light clothes became her. The keen {{mountain}} breezes {{had given her}} a fine color, and she looked very fresh and young by contrast with the jaded business man at her side. Cliffe wore an old gray suit that Evelyn had never seen and shabby leggings. A creel hung round his shoulders, and he carried a fishing-rod. His face was lined and pale, but when they left the garden and entered the woods Evelyn was surprised to note that his thin figure harmonized with the scattered boulders and the ragged pines. To some extent, this might be accounted for by the neutral tint of his clothes, but he somehow looked at home <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wilderness. Though he had once or twice gone off with an old friend on a shooting trip, she had never thought of her father as a sport.|$|R

5|$|However, off northeastern Brazil, {{the female}} {{reproductive}} cycle is short enough to occur annually. Vitellogenesis (the formation of yolk within the ovary) occurs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer,</b> and is immediately followed by mating and fertilization in the fall, {{with the young}} being born the following spring to summer. The seasonality of these events means the reproductive cycle is offset by six months between populations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The gestation period has been variously estimated at eight months off northeastern Brazil and 911 months off the southeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|In 1870 Brassey {{was told}} that he had cancer but he {{continued}} to visit his working sites.

In his late 60s or (more probably) his 70s by this stage, Nicholas was an extremely old man, yet in 1307 he became Bishop of Dunblane. He held this position until his death in either 1319 or 1320.|$|E

In particular, they had to explain why they alerted generals loyal to Justinian but failed to inform the emperor himself. Bouzes, Constantianus, Marcellus and Leontius testified under oath to the innocence of Germanus.|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of temporal and spatial effects was assessed in helminth communities of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) in 3 woodland sites in N. E. Poland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summers</b> of 1999 and 2002. Among common species the rank order of sites in relation to prevalence and abundance of infection was maintained between surveys. Site effects accounted for most of <b>the</b> deviance (<b>in</b> statistical models), and time was less important, so the exact location from which voles were sampled was of critical importance. The only exception was Syphacia petrusewiczi. In contrast, for derived measures such as species richness and diversity, most deviance was accounted for by host age, and the interaction between site and year was significant, implying that rank order of sites changed between years. Temporal effects on derived measures were generated primarily {{by a combination of}} relatively small changes in prevalence and abundance of the common, rather than the rare, species between the years of <b>the</b> study. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> medium-term, therefore, helminth communities of bank voles in N. E. Poland had a stable core, suggesting a substantial strong element of predictability...|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> of 1810 the French Navy {{made their}} first {{serious effort to}} contest British {{operations}} in the Adriatic, with the despatch of Bernard Dubourdieu from Toulon in Favorite. Dubourdieu {{was considered one of}} the more successful frigate commanders in the French Navy, and he collected the French and Italian forces scattered across the Adriatic into a squadron that significantly outnumbered Hoste's forces. Hoste was aware of Dubourdieu's movements and maintained a careful watch on the French-led squadron in its base at Ancona.|$|E
5|$|Mycena cinerella is a {{saprobic}} fungus, and derives nutrients by decomposing {{leaf litter}} and similar detritus, converting it to humus and mineralizing organic {{matter in the}} soil. The fruit bodies grow in groups on needles under pine and Douglas fir, typically <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn. In the United States, it has been collected from Michigan, Washington, Oregon, and California. In Europe, {{it has also been}} collected from the Great Britain, Norway, Poland, and Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Parasola auricoma is a {{saprobic}} species, and so obtains nutrients {{by breaking}} down organic matter into simpler molecules. The fruit bodies grow either singly or in groups, often in large numbers, at road sides in deciduous forests, or on grassy areas. The mushrooms are short-lived, usually lasting {{only for a}} few hours before collapsing. Common in Europe and North America (including Hawaii), it has also been recorded from Japan. In Europe, fruit bodies appear most commonly in spring and summer months, while in North America, fruiting is more common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn, after rains.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> climate <b>in</b> Brogden is {{characterized}} by warm summers and moderate winters. The average temperature is about 62 degrees.

60|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> edge of {{the woods}} and the open spaces among the trees the {{blueberries}} grew larger and sweeter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> Northern <b>summer</b> than a more southern sun seems to make them. They hung dense upon the low bushes, and gave them their tint through the soft grey bloom that veiled their blue. Sweet-fern in patches broke their mass here and there, and exhaled its wild perfume to the foot or skirt brushing through it.|$|R
5|$|The Turkish {{forces in}} Anatolia {{were led by}} Mustafa Kemal, who Hananu {{established}} contact with via intermediaries, chief of whom was Jamil Ibrahim Pasha. The latter, who was an Arabized Kurd, Ottoman World War veteran and absentee landlord from Aleppo, met Mustafa Kemal in Gaziantep <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> of 1920. During their meeting, an agreement was concluded to launch a propaganda campaign funded by the Turks against the French occupation. The campaign began in Aleppo in December 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight time}} of the adults or imagines begins <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> to early autumn, but the date depends on the region and climate. The males hatch out earlier than females and create swarms which gather around the treetops. The females seek out leks and couple with the males on the {{uppermost}} shoots. Then the females search for suitable host trees, if possible choosing weak and dry wood. They orient on monoterpene hydrocarbon compounds, which weakened trees produce. When a tree is stressed through dryness or exterior injuries, the compounds pervade osmotic barriers and escape from the bark.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes {{are most}} common in spring and least common in winter, but tornadoes can occur any time of year that {{favorable}} conditions occur. Spring and fall experience peaks of activity as those are the seasons when stronger winds, wind shear, and atmospheric instability are present. Tornadoes are focused in the right front quadrant of landfalling tropical cyclones, which tend to occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summer</b> and autumn. Tornadoes can also be spawned {{as a result of}} eyewall mesovortices, which persist until landfall.|$|E

40|$|Helminth infections {{were studied}} in bank voles (Myodes glareolus) from 3 {{woodland}} sites in N. E. Poland <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>summers</b> of 1999 and 2002, {{to assess the}} temporal stability of derived statistics describing the regional helminth fauna and component community structure, and spatial influence on the latter. Regional helminth fauna changed dramatically between the two years, primarily due to a fall <b>in</b> <b>the</b> abundance of Syphacia petrusewiczi but was partially compensated for {{by an increase in}} Mesocestoides lineatus and Cladotaenia globifera. It was dominated by nematodes overall, but more so in 1999 than in 2002 when larval cestodes were more frequent. Most derived parameters for component community structure varied considerably between sites and the two surveys, the hierarchical order for sites not being maintained between surveys. They were susceptible to the disproportionate influence of three relatively rare, unpredictable species with the greatest overall aggregated distribution among hosts. Jaccard’s similarity index was less influenced by the rare species, showing greater stability between sites and across years. In conclusion, temporal variation confounded any site-specific characteristics of the summary measures quantified in this study and their usefulness is therefore restricted to <b>the</b> years <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> surveys were conducted...|$|R
