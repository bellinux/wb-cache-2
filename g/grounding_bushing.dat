The U.S. Supreme Court's verdict in Bush v.

25|$|When spiders {{moved from}} the water to the land in the Early Devonian period, they started making silk to protect their bodies and their eggs. Spiders {{gradually}} started using silk for hunting purposes, first as guide lines and signal lines, then as <b>ground</b> or <b>bush</b> webs, and eventually as the aerial webs that are familiar today.|$|R

5000|$|.....is in low, isolated, rocky hills, {{near the}} plains on which live antelopes, its {{principal}} prey. It also kills gazelles, nilgai, and, doubtless, occasionally deer and other animals. Instances also occur of {{sheep and goats}} being carried off by it, but it rarely molests domestic animals, {{and has not been}} known to attack men. Its mode of capturing its prey is to stalk up to within a moderate distance of between one to two hundred yards, taking advantage of inequalities of the <b>ground,</b> <b>bushes,</b> or other cover, and then to make a rush. Its speed for a short distance is remarkable far exceeding that of any other beast of prey, even of a greyhound or kangaroo-hound, for no dog can at first overtake an Indian antelope or a gazelle, either of which is quickly run down by C. jubatus, if the start does not exceed about two hundred yards. General McMaster saw a very fine hunting-leopard catch a black buck that had about that start within four hundred yards. It is probable that for a short distance the hunting-leopard is the swiftest of all mammals. Blanford writing on the Asiatic cheetah in India quoted by Lydekker ...|$|R
50|$|Oxyopes lineatus is {{primarily}} a European spider and has been reported from Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Slovenia, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, Turkey, Romania, Ukraine, and southern Russia.

50|$|Individuals {{were found}} in {{disturbed}} habitat between mountain evergreen forests and agricultural land, 1-2m above the <b>ground</b> in <b>bushes.</b> This species may be restricted to remaining secondary habitat in Rakhine as remnant populations, or (as with other Chirixalus species in Myanmar) they might prefer degraded habitats. Animals were not found in evergreen forests (Wilkinson et al. 2003). The eggs are deposited in foam nests, in particular on plants of the genus Arum, hanging over standing water. The larvae presumably develop in the water.|$|R

40|$|Phenological {{observations}} have a {{long tradition}} in the Czech Republic; the first phenological notes were taken in the 18 th century. Within the entire phenological observation network of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute, 45 plant species can be observed. These include perennial herbs, grass, and <b>ground</b> <b>bushes</b> growing wildly. Some observed species are among the group of so-called allergens, e. g. silver birch (Betula pendula Roth), cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.), and meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis L.). In this paper, we evaluated the phenological phase beginning of flowering {{for two of the}} aforementioned plants at the Mlýny, Chřibská research site (50 ° 52 ’N, 14 ° 29 ’E, 350 m a. s. l.). The aim was to assess which meteorological parameters influence phenological onsets as well as to analyze shifts in phenophase onset dates and temperature trends during 1959 – 2014. During this period, for B. pendula the average date of beginning of flowering was 28 April {{with a standard deviation of}} 10 days and for A. pratensis it was 20 May with a standard deviation of 8 days. The studied species are allergens and their timing and phenological shifting during the spring and their relationship with climate parameters may provide important information for forecasts as part of a pollen warning service...|$|R
50|$|The Saints' offense led the NFL in scoring, {{averaging}} {{just under}} 32 points per game. Brees finished {{the season as}} the NFL's top rated quarterback (109.6), completing an NFL-record 70.6% of his passes for 4,338 yards and 34 touchdowns, with just 11 interceptions. His top target was Colston, who caught 70 passes for 1,074 yards and 9 touchdowns, but he had plenty of other weapons, such as receivers Devery Henderson (51 receptions) and Robert Meachem (45), along with tight ends Jeremy Shockey (48) and Dave Thomas (35). With fullback Heath Evans out of action due to injury {{for most of the}} season, Dave Thomas often lined up as a fullback, with tackle Zach Strief serving as an extra blocker on short yardage plays. The ground attack was led by running backs Pierre Thomas and Mike Bell. Thomas rushed for 793 yards and caught 39 passes for 302, while Bell added 654 yards on the <b>ground.</b> <b>Bush</b> was also a major contributor, rushing for 390 yards (with a 5.6 yards per carry average), catching 47 passes for 335 yards, and adding another 130 yards returning punts. New Orleans also had a strong offensive line with three Pro Bowl selections: guard Jahri Evans, center Jonathan Goodwin, and tackle Jon Stinchcomb.|$|R
