5|$|The Mikea are {{culturally}} and linguistically {{nearly identical to}} the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> three groups. The popular association of the Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed to widespread belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, such as being small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect harmony with the natural environment. None of these are borne out by evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{two species}} of Seorsumuscardinus are known from {{isolated}} teeth, which show that they were medium-sized dormice with flat teeth. The teeth are all characterized by long transverse crests coupled with shorter ones. One of these crests, the anterotropid, <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> two species, as it {{is present in the}} lower molars of S.alpinus, but not in those of S.bolligeri. Another crest, the centroloph, reaches the outer margin of the first upper molar in S.bolligeri, but not in S.alpinus. Seorsumuscardinus may be related to Muscardinus, the genus of the living hazel dormouse, which appears at about the same time, and the older Glirudinus.|$|E

5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped {{to determine whether there}} are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in whether there is a national security issue involved.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{typically}} breed from December to April. Copulation lasts from 16–73 {{minutes and}} may occur in water or on land. During the breeding, the male grabs the female {{by the neck}} with his teeth. Copulation is vigorous, and is interrupted by periods of rest. Females may caterwaul during or shortly after mating. Female estrus lasts about a month per year, and true gestation lasts 61–63 days. Because the otters delay implantation for at least eight months, the interval between copulation and parturition can reach 10–12 months. Delayed implantation <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> species from the European otter, which lacks this feature. Young are born between February and April, and parturition lasts three to eight hours.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} Strandzha is {{influenced}} by the proximity of the Black, Marmara and Aegean seas which clearly <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> local climate from that of the rest of Bulgaria. The region is among the warmest in the country with temperatures rarely falling below 0°C in winter and rising above 24°C in summer due to the cooling effect of the Black Sea. The average temperature drops with the rising elevation in the interior which creates conditions for more frequent and longer-lasting mists, heavier snowfall and earlier frosts. In winter frequent fogs lead to hard rime and the icing of the forests at altitudes above 50.|$|E

5|$|The rodent fauna of the Northern Highlands of Madagascar {{remained}} {{almost totally}} unstudied until the 1990s. A 1994 {{survey of the}} Anjanaharibe-Sud Reserve partially filled this gap {{and led to the}} discovery of two new species: Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat and northern voalavo, the first known and type species of the genus Voalavo. Both species were formally described in 1998 by Michael Carleton and Steven Goodman. The generic name, Voalavo, is a general Malagasy word for rodent, and the specific name, gymnocaudus, refers to the naked tail, which <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> northern voalavo from the related tufted-tailed rats (Eliurus). In 2000, the species was also recorded from the nearby Marojejy National Park.|$|E
5|$|Transandinomys {{species are}} medium-sized, soft-furred rice rats. They closely {{resemble}} other medium-sized lowland forest rice rats, such as Hylaeamys and Euryoryzomys from the Amazon rainforest and surrounding areas and Handleyomys alfaroi from Central America and northwestern South America. In general, Transandinomys are distinguished from those animals {{by their very}} long superciliary vibrissae (whiskers above the eyes). Euryoryzomys species are in general slightly larger and Hylaeamys are about as large as Transandinomys, so that the only feature of external morphology that <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> two genera is {{the length of the}} vibrissae. Handleyomys alfaroi is smaller than both species of Transandinomys, but juvenile Transandinomys may be confused with similarly colored adult H.alfaroi.|$|E
5|$|The {{bay bolete}} was first named as Boletus castaneus ß badius (i.e. a {{subspecies}} of Boletus castaneus) by Elias Magnus Fries in 1818. Fries later renamed it as {{a variety of}} Boletus castaneus in 1828, before assigning it distinct species status in his 1832 work Elenchus Fungorum. The fungus has been transferred to several genera in its taxonomic history: Rostkovites by Petter Karsten in 1881; Viscipellis and Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1886 and 1888, respectively; and Suillus by Otto Kuntze in 1898. In 1931, Edouard-Jean Gilbert reclassified it in the genus Xerocomus, and many sources still list it thus. Review of Xerocomus strongly suggested it was polyphyletic, and the genus was not accepted by some mycologists. The stickiness of its wet cap <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> species from others classified in Xerocomus, and hence it was left in Boletus until Alfredo Vizzini placed it in its own genus in 2014. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that Imleria badia is related to B.pallidus and B.glabellus; the three species form a clade known informally as the badius clade within a larger group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder Boletineae. Other clades within the group include the Tylopilus, porcini (= Boletus sensu stricto) and Strobilomyces clades, {{as well as two}} other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus (the taxa designated as Xerocomus species in this clade are not Xerocomus species and require new taxonomic designations) and Xerocomellus.|$|E

5|$|The single known tooth, a worn left upper molar {{known as}} T Li 175, is large for a treeshrew, with {{a length of}} 3.57mm and width of 4.79mm. Although Mein and Ginsburg {{described}} it a second upper molar (M2), Ni and Qiu argued in 2012 {{that it is more}} likely a first upper molar (M1). It is dilambdodont (with a W-shaped chewing surface) and the labial surface (the side of the cheeks) is concave and bears a cingular crest. A well-developed small cusp, a mesostyle, is present on the labial side. The presence of the mesostyle <b>distinguishes</b> <b>the</b> animal from Ptilocercus, {{the only member of the}} treeshrew family Ptilocercidae. The lingual (tongue) side is narrow. A large cusp, the protocone, is on the front lingual corner. Two crests descend from it; one reaches the paracone on the front labial side and another approaches the metacone to the back of the tooth. A smaller cusp, a hypocone, is on the back lingual corner. This feature distinguishes T.miocenica both from the treeshrew genera Dendrogale, Prodendrogale, and Palaeotupaia, which lack the cusp entirely, and from Anathana and Urogale, which have a large hypocone. In T.miocenica the back and lingual sides of the hypocone are straight and form a right angle with each other. The tooth most closely resembles Tupaia species with a simple mesostyle, such as the common treeshrew (Tupaia glis). However, this species is smaller and unlike in T. miocenica, the hypocone is not isolated from the protocone by a narrow valley.|$|E
