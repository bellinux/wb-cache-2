5|$|Police {{departments}} throughout Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or {{charges have been}} dropped for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted drug dealers. Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 which were not pursued because the grow operations were legal, even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, was found with evidence of making <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> which is not protected, though a grand jury did not indict him.|$|E
5|$|On May 6, 2008, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) {{announced}} {{the arrest of}} 96 individuals, of whom 75 were San Diego State University students, {{on a variety of}} drug charges in a multiple-month narcotics sting called Operation Sudden Fall. Two kilograms of cocaine were seized, along with 50 pounds of marijuana, 350 Ecstasy pills, <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> methamphetamine, other drug paraphernalia, three guns, and $60,000 in cash. Several months after the May 6 announcement, it was reported {{that the majority of the}} defendants had pleaded guilty to the felony charges. The defendants were then either placed on probation or were required to enter drug diversion programs. Other defendants only received citations or had their cases dismissed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> is a {{resinous}} {{matrix of}} cannabinoids {{obtained from the}} Cannabis plant by solvent extraction, formed into a hardened or viscous mass. <b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> {{can be the most}} potent of the main cannabis products because of its high level of psychoactive compound per its volume, which can vary depending on the plant's mix of essential oils and psychoactive compounds. Butane and supercritical carbon dioxide <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> have become popular in recent years.|$|E
2500|$|Moamba de galinha (or chicken moamba, [...] ) is {{chicken with}} palm paste, okra, garlic and palm <b>oil</b> <b>hash</b> or {{red palm oil}} sauce, often served with rice and funge. Both funge and moamba de galinha have been {{considered}} the national dish. A variant dish of moamba de galinha, muamba de ginguba, uses ginguba ( [...] , peanut sauce) instead of palm paste.|$|R
25|$|PTFE {{sheets are}} used in the {{production}} of butane <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> due to its non-stick properties and resistance to non-polar solvents.|$|E
500|$|The {{crowd was}} larger than {{anticipated}} and spanned {{the entire length of}} the [...] Burnside Bridge. Belville had initially expected [...] "between 50 and 5,000 people", but details of the event spread online and through word of mouth, and ultimately it was estimated that [...] "thousands" [...] had turned out. Some attendees said they were there to commemorate an historic moment, while others admitted having come for free marijuana and cannabis seeds. One man, known as [...] "Pork Chop" [...] (or [...] "Porkchop"), reportedly announced over a megaphone that he had 420 pounds of marijuana to distribute, though his claim was not supported by news outlets. Two women with Ideal Farms, who wished to [...] "share the love", distributed joints to attendees who could prove that they were of legal age. One man distributed drops of <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> and Belville himself shared an ounce of marijuana (the maximum allowed under Oregon Ballot Measure 91). Some participants did receive free marijuana, seeds, and/or starter plants, but many did not, due to the larger than expected crowd. Coupons were also distributed for later redemption.|$|E

50|$|Various {{forms of}} the drug {{cannabis}} exist, including extracts such as hashish and <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> which, because of appearance, {{are more susceptible to}} adulterants when left unregulated.|$|E
50|$|The {{tetrahydrocannabinol}} (THC) {{content of}} <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> varies tremendously, since the manufacturers use a varying assortment of marijuana plants and preparation techniques. Dealers sometimes cut hash oils with other oils.|$|E
50|$|DANGER! Most of the {{solvents}} employed vaporize {{quickly and}} are flammable, making the extraction process dangerous. Several explosion and fire incidents related to <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> manufacturing attempts in {{homes have been}} reported.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> is {{consumed}} usually by smoking, ingestion, or vaporization. [...] Smoking or vaporizing <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> is known colloquially as [...] "dabbing", from the English verb to daub (Dutch dabben, French dauber), [...] "to smear with something adhesive". Dabbing devices include special kinds of water pipes ("oil rigs"), and vaporizers similar in design to electronic cigarettes. [...] Oil rigs include a glass water pipe and a hollow tube (called a [...] "nail"), with an indentation {{on the side}} which is sometimes covered with a dome. [...] The pipe is often heated with a blowtorch rather than a cigarette lighter.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> is {{not very}} {{lipophilic}} and it may however ooze through and swell common glove materials such as natural rubber, except maybe polar materials such as cellulose film, neoprene and nitrile rubber.|$|E
50|$|As of 2015 {{the health}} effects of using <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> were poorly documented. Cannabis {{extracts}} have less plant matter and create less harmful smoke, however, trace amounts of impurities are not generally regarded as safe (GRAS).|$|E
50|$|<b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> is {{produced}} by solvent extraction (maceration, infusion or percolation) of marijuana or hashish. After filtering and evaporating the solvent, a sticky resinous dank liquid with a strong herbal odor (remarkably different from the peculiar odor of hemp) remains.|$|E
50|$|On 14 April 2014, Lavoro's {{neighbor}} {{called the}} police to report the scent of cannabis, and on arrival the police discovered Lavoro in possession of cannabis brownies made with <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> which Lavoro allegedly intended to sell for $25 per serving.|$|E
50|$|Fresh, undried plant {{material}} is less suited for <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> production, because much THC and CBD will {{be present in}} their carboxylic acid forms (THCA and CBDA), {{which may not be}} highly soluble in some solvents. The acids are decarboxylated during drying and heating (smoking).|$|E
50|$|One {{pound of}} {{marijuana}} yields from 1/5 to 1/10 of {{a pound of}} <b>hash</b> <b>oil.</b> The oil may retain considerable residual solvent: oil extracted with longer-chain volatile hydrocarbons (such as naphtha) is less viscous (thinner) than oil extracted with short-chain hydrocarbons (such as butane).|$|E
50|$|Adults in the Northern Territory {{found in}} {{possession}} of up to 50 g of marijuana, one gram of <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> 10 g of hash or cannabis seed, or two non-hydroponic plants can be fined A$200 with 28 days to expiate rather than face a criminal charge.|$|E
50|$|Hemp oil or {{hempseed}} oil is obtained by pressing hemp seeds. Cold pressed, unrefined hemp oil is dark to clear light green in color, with a nutty flavour. The darker the color, the grassier the flavour. It {{should not be}} confused with <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> a tetrahydrocannabinol-containing oil made from the Cannabis flower, hailed by some for its medicinal qualities.|$|E
50|$|Tiny {{pieces of}} leaf matter may be accidentally or even {{purposely}} added; adulterants introduced when the hashish is being produced will reduce {{the purity of the}} material and often resulting in green finished product. The tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content of hashish comes in wide ranges from almost none to 65% and that of <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> from 30% to 90%.|$|E
5000|$|The LD50 for THC (Delta 9 Tetrahydrocannabinol) is {{not exactly}} known. <b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> can contain up to 80% THC (wash with alkali) though up to 99% with other methods of extraction. While health issues of the lungs may be {{exacerbated}} by use of Hashoil, {{it is not known}} to cause side effects not already found in other preparations of Cannabis ...|$|E
50|$|Keep out {{of reach}} of children. <b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> should be stored in {{airtight}} containers and protected from light. When exposed to air, warmth and light (especially without antioxidants), the oil loses its taste and psychoactivity due to aging. Cannabinoid carboxylic acids (THCA, CBDA, and maybe others) have an antibiotic effect on gram-positive bacteria such as (penicillin-resistant) Staphylococcus aureus, but gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli are unaffected.|$|E
50|$|Jacob Lavoro was a Texan {{teenager}} {{who was arrested}} in 2014 for possession of marijuana with intent to sell; the unusual factor in Lavoro's case was that although his batch of cannabis brownies used 2.5 grams of <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> by Texas law he was charged by the entire weight of the finished brownies, 1.5 pounds, making his case a felony with a potential punishment of life in prison.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1998 {{interview}} with Goldmine magazine, bassist John Taylor {{admitted that he}} was struggling with his drug addictions during recording of the album. He said, [...] "When we were in rehearsal, it seemed like {{we had a great}} album, but we weren't able to parlay it into a great album in the studio, whatever. I can just remember smoking <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> that's all I can really remember about making that album." ...|$|E
50|$|After {{revisions}} to cannabis rescheduling in the UK, the government moved cannabis {{back from a}} class C to a class B drug. A purported reason was the appearance of high potency cannabis. They believe skunk accounts for between 70 and 80% of samples seized by police (despite the fact that skunk can sometimes be incorrectly mistaken {{for all types of}} herbal cannabis). Extracts such as hashish and <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> typically contain more THC than high potency cannabis flowers.|$|E
50|$|In modern terminology, Thai stick often {{refers to}} {{marijuana}} {{tied to a}} stem as documented above and then dipped into a hashish oil, a potent cannabis derivative which saturates the buds and lends to a stronger smoke. Some California and Washington cannabis clubs sell this product. Originally, this was a frequent practice of the 1970s with the actual Thai stick. There are still some surviving recipes from Cambodia where high quality marijuana and <b>hash</b> <b>oil</b> are used.|$|E
5000|$|According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), [...] "the {{amount of}} THC {{present in a}} {{cannabis}} sample is generally used {{as a measure of}} cannabis potency." [...] The three main forms of cannabis products are the flower, resin (hashish), and oil (<b>hash</b> <b>oil).</b> The UNODC states that cannabis often contains 5% THC content, resin [...] "can contain up to 20% THC content", and that [...] "Cannabis oil may contain more than 60% THC content." ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> is {{an extract}} that is formed when a solvent, {{commonly}} including; butane, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, hexane, or toluene, {{is used as}} to dissolve THC concentrations. The plant particulates are filtered out and then the solvent carrying the soluble resins is evaporated or purged under vacuum. The resultant oil may have a high THC content (depending on the parent material) and is used in various cannabis-based products or smoked or vaporized as a concentrate. Delta 9 THC (D9 THC) is strongly soluble in petroleum ether and less so in ethanol. Adding petroleum ether to the tincture will extract D9 THC, leaving water-soluble chemicals in the ethanol (certain cannabinoids, proteins, chlorophyll, etc.). Butane is a more selective solvent which typically carries lower amounts of undesired solubles, resulting in a more pure THC. Alcohol is less selective than butane, carrying other types of plant matter such as chlorophylls and lipids, resulting in a less pure <b>hash</b> <b>oil,</b> freezing the plant matter prior to making hash from alcohol can prevent some chlorophyll from being carried. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) has also been used to extract hash, but special laboratory equipment is needed since CO2 only functions as a solvent under high pressure.|$|E

50|$|The Thai Sticks {{exhibited}} {{considerably higher}} potency {{in comparison with}} other cannabis available in Western countries at the time. This added potency was rumored {{to be caused by}} the Thai Sticks being dipped in opium or in <b>hash</b> <b>oil.</b> However, the more widely accepted reason is that Thai cannabis growers had for hundreds of years selected seeds from their strongest plants, which coupled with Thailand's long growing season, high temperatures, and rich volcanic soil, conspired to produce an exceptionally potent product.|$|E

In an encounter with Zachariya, Murugan learns that Daddy is illegal producing <b>Hash</b> <b>oil</b> and exporting under the cover-up of the pharmacy, where Manikuttan is working. He co-operates with police to rat on Daddy. Manikuttan is caught by Shiva {{in the middle of}} extracting evidences of their activities, he tortures him. Murugan rescues Manikuttan, but in the tussle, Shiva is accidentally killed by Murugan. Police ambush Daddy, but he manages to escape.|$|E
