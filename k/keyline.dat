In general, the GUI packages are easier to learn, while scripting tools are more powerful and extensible. Widely used and well-documented GUI packages include NetMiner, UCINet, Pajek (freeware), GUESS, ORA, Cytoscape, Gephi, SocNetV (free software) and muxViz (opensource). Private GUI packages directed at business customers include: Orgnet, which provides training {{on the use of}} its software, Polinode, Keyhubs, <b>KeyLines,</b> KXEN, Keynetiq and Linkurious.

40|$|This thesis has a {{three-fold}} aim. The {{first one}} regards {{the design and}} implementation of a multiphysics framework for high-performance scientific and engineering computing. The other two aims are built {{on top of the}} first one, and they regard {{the development and implementation of}} two software components for the simulation of Fluid Flow and Radiative Heat Transfer respectively. The thesis is organized in three parts, one for each aim. The first aim is devoted to the development and implementation of a software platform on top of which it is possible to develop software application aimed to any specific kind of simulation. The <b>keylines</b> of this platform are: effectiveness, efficiency, flexibility and usability. Following these <b>keylines</b> simultaneously is a challenging task, it can be accomplished only by developing novel strategies for making the following three aspects sinergically work together: numerical methods, physical modeling, computer science. In the first part of the thesis we shall discuss our efforts in this direction. The second aim is devoted to the development and implementation of a Fluid Flow solver able to deal with Euler and Laminar Navier-Stokes equations. It is able to perform 3 D parallel computation on mixed unstructured meshes. Therefore an application on top of the multiphysics framework has been developed and implemented which is able to address the problem of simulating flow fields using the finite volume method. The third aim is devoted to another application, that is, the computation of Radiative Heat Transfer. This aim was accomplished by developing some novel metodologies, such as the development and parallel implementation of a particular Monte Carlo approach for computing radiative heat transfer, and a novel particle tracking algorithm for tracking particle-like entities accross mixed 2 D or 3 D unstructured meshes in parallel computation. ...|$|R
5000|$|In a {{time when}} {{distance}} learning involves the Internet and commercial illustration is generated by computers, {{the concept of a}} mail-correspondence art school seems like a quaint throwback. But Art Instruction Schools continues to crank out people who know how to draw with pen, pencil or brush, the old-fashioned way. Prospective students still get a visit from one of the school's 100 or so enrollment representatives who roam the country conducting entrance interviews/sales pitches. If you sign up for the $3,485 course, the 27 lessons are sent to you one at a time. You work at your own pace and send your assignments back to the school, where an instructor grades them, makes suggestions and mails them back. If you stick with it for 1Â½ to two years, you'll cover such fundamentals as shapes, shading, colors, perspective, animal and figure drawing, lettering, cartooning, <b>keylining</b> and fashion illustration. Accredited by the Distance Education and Training Council, the course is worth up to 24 college credits, according to school marketing director Steve Unverzagt. [...] "It's literally an old-school kind of method," [...] he said.|$|R
50|$|<b>Keyline</b> also {{includes}} concepts for rapid soil fertility enhancement and these concepts are explored in Priority One by P. A. Yeomans' son Allan.

50|$|<b>Keyline</b> {{design is}} a {{technique}} for maximizing the beneficial use of water resources {{of a piece of}} land developed in Australia by farmer and engineer P. A. Yeomans. The <b>Keyline</b> refers to a specific topographic feature linked to water flow which is used in designing the drainage system of the site. The essential factor in this system, the <b>Keyline,</b> is a level or sloping line extending in both directions from a point or divides the two types of relationship, always in the same vertical interval, that a valley bears to its ridges.|$|E

5000|$|P. A. Yeomans' <b>Keyline</b> Design {{system is}} {{critical}} of traditional contour plowing techniques, and improves the system through observing normal land form and topography. At {{one end of a}} contour the slope of the land will always be steeper than at the other. Thus when plowing parallel runs paralleling any contour the plow furrows soon deviate from a true contour. Rain water in these furrows will thus flow sideways along the falling [...] "contour" [...] line. This can often concentrate water in a ways that exacerbates erosion instead of reducing it. Yeomans was the first to appreciate the significance of this phenomenon. <b>Keyline</b> cultivation utilizes this [...] "off contour" [...] drift in cultivating furrows to control the movement of rain water {{for the benefit of the}} land. ( [...] See Chapter 7 in Priority One History of Twentieth Century Soil Conservation and <b>Keyline.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Reforestation, {{conservation}} grazing, holistic land management, and, in drylands,water harvesting and <b>keyline</b> design, {{are examples}} of methods that might help prevent or lessen these drying effects.|$|E

50|$|David Holmgren's {{design and}} {{development}} of the settlement is perhaps his most significant test of his Permaculture principles. Central features of the village design are, the integration of domestic forestry with selective thinning for fire-safety (the harvested wood provides fuel for domestic wood stoves), the integration of the <b>Keyline</b> design system of water storage, and transfer with the village road network and residential home site location. The water <b>keyline</b> storage system is the main design instrument for the regeneration of a landscape degraded by over 50 years of gold mining.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a smooth}} grassy valley, a {{location}} called the keypoint {{can be found}} where the lower and flatter portion of a primary valley floor suddenly steepens. The <b>keyline</b> of this primary valley is revealed by pegging a contour line through the keypoint, within the valley shape. All the points on the line are at the same elevation as the keypoint. Contour plowing parallel to the <b>Keyline,</b> both above and below will automatically become [...] "off-contour" [...] but the developing pattern will tend to drift rainwater runoff away from the valley centre and incidentally, prevent erosion.|$|E
50|$|David Holmgren, one of {{the founders}} of Permaculture, used Yeoman's <b>keyline</b> {{principle}} extensively in the formulation of Permaculture concepts and the design of sustainable human settlements and organic farms.|$|E
50|$|<b>Keyline</b> pattern {{cultivation}} on ridge shapes is done {{parallel to}} any suitable contour but only {{working on the}} upper side of the contour guide line. This automatically develops a pattern of off-contour cultivation {{in which all the}} rip marks left in the soil will slope down towards the centre of the ridge shape. This pattern of cultivation allows more time for water to soak in. <b>Keyline</b> pattern cultivation also enables controlled flood irrigation of undulating land, which further assists in the fast development of deep biologically fertile soil, which results in improving soil nutrition and health.|$|E
5000|$|In many countries, {{including}} Australia, it {{is important}} to get optimum absorption of rainfall and <b>keyline</b> cultivation does this as well as delaying the potentially damaging concentration of runoff. Yeomans' technique differs from traditional contour plowing in several important respects. Random contour plowing also becomes off contour but usually with the opposite effect on runoff water causing it to quickly shed off ridge shapes and be concentrated in valleys. The limitations of the traditional system of soil conservation, with its [...] "safe disposal" [...] approach to farm water was an important motivational factor {{in the development of the}} <b>keyline</b> system.|$|E
