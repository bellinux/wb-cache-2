25|$|I do {{not quite}} {{understand}} what it is that compels me to type this letter. Perhaps it is to leave some vague reason for the actions I have recently performed. I do not really understand myself these days. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>supposed</b> to be an average reasonable and intelligent young man. However, lately (I cannot recall when it started) I have been a victim of many unusual and irrational thoughts. These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks.|$|E
500|$|The {{tributes to}} Stengel upon his death were many. Maury Allen wrote, [...] "He {{is gone and}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>supposed</b> to cry, but I laugh. Every time I saw the man, every time I heard his voice, every time his name was mentioned, the creases in my mouth would give way and a smile would come to my face." [...] Richie Ashburn, {{a member of the}} 1962 Mets, stated, [...] "Don't shed any tears for Casey. He wouldn't want you to... He was the happiest man I've ever seen." [...] Jim Murray of the Los Angeles Times [...] wrote, [...] "God is {{certainly}} getting an earful tonight." ...|$|E
500|$|Cope {{took his}} sinking {{fortunes}} in stride. In writing to Osborn about the articles, {{he laughed at}} the outcome, saying, [...] "It will now rest largely with you whether or not <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>supposed</b> to be a liar and am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus." [...] Cope {{was well aware of}} his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of [...] "Cope" [...] and [...] "hater", Anisonchus cophater. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times observed, [...] "I admired this movie. It kept me at arm's length, {{but that}} is where <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>supposed</b> to be; the {{characters}} are after all at arm's length from each other, and {{the tragedy of the}} story is implied but never spoken aloud. It will help, I think, to be familiar with the novel, or to make a leap of sympathy with the characters." ...|$|E
2500|$|During World War II (1942–1945) he was interned {{in various}} Japanese {{concentration}} camps such as Tjimahi and the infamous Changi Prison. Imprisoned in Tjimahi Tjalie Robinson kept on writing. He {{was part of}} a small group of intellectuals (including Leo Vroman and Rob Nieuwenhuys) that engaged in cultural activity. For a while Tjalie Robinson was even able to print a camp periodical named 'Kampkroniek' (Camp Chronicles) and a pamphlet named 'Onschendbaar Domein' (Inviolable Domain). The gruesome war experience obviously influenced his life philosophy, nevertheless Tjalie Robinson never wrote much about his years as a POW. On occasion he tried to reflect with an uneasy mix of shame and fascination: [...] "Sometimes I reluctantly look back at that time <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>supposed</b> to hate. (60 years and 60 thousand emotions packed into 1 night.) Surrounded by life-threatening situations and you know your alone against Fate. Fight, Johny Brown, fight. Ulcers, malaria, diphtheria, bullits and landmines. [...] Knowing physical exhaustion, the stench of swamps, the rattling of snakes, anachoic hunting grounds." ...|$|E
