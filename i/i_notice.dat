500|$|Burton hired Wesley Strick {{to do an}} uncredited rewrite. Strick recalled, [...] "When I {{was hired}} to write Batman Returns (Batman II at the time), the big problem of the script was Penguin's lack of a 'master plan'." [...] Warner Bros. {{presented}} Strick with warming, or freezing Gotham City, a plot point they would later use in Batman & Robin. Strick gained inspiration from a Moses parallel that had Penguin killing the firstborn sons of Gotham. A similar notion was used when the Penguin's parents threw him into a river as a baby. Robin appeared in the script, but was deleted because Waters felt the film had too many characters. Waters called Robin [...] "the most worthless character in the world, especially with [...] the loner of loners." [...] Robin {{started out as a}} juvenile gang leader, who becomes an ally to Batman. Robin was later changed to a black teenage garage mechanic. Waters explained, [...] "He's wearing this old-fashioned garage mechanic uniform and it has an 'R' on it. He drives the Batmobile, which <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> they used in the third film!" [...] Marlon Wayans was cast, and signed for a sequel. The actor had attended a wardrobe fitting, but it was decided to save the character for a third installment.|$|E
2500|$|And a {{follow-up}} email {{from the same}} day: [...] "Decompression sickness, or caisson disease, or [...] "the bends" [...] was first documented in the 1840s. [...] A competent doctor could not mistake this condition for malaria or some other tropical fever. [...] <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> the article doesn't actually say malaria - - -it says [...] "fever." [...] There are dozens.|$|E
2500|$|American comedian George Carlin, in his {{interview}} for the Archive of American Television, refers to Casals when discussing the restless nature of an artist's persona. As Carlin states, when Casals (then aged 93) was {{asked why he}} continued to practice the cello three hours a day, Casals replied, [...] "'I'm beginning to notice some improvement...' nd that's the thing that's in me. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> myself getting better at this," [...] Carlin continued.|$|E

2500|$|The show draws to a {{close with}} the {{chairman}} imparting some final words of wisdom intended to evoke time, destiny, fate and eternity, undercut with silliness. For example: [...] "...And so, as the hunter of time blasts the moose of eternity, and the dairy counter worker of fate sighs and grabs her mop..." [...] Lyttelton's final sign-off on the show, shortly before his death in April 2008, was: [...] "And so as the loose-bowelled pigeon of time swoops low over the unsuspecting tourist of destiny, and the flatulent skunk of fate wanders into the air-conditioning system of eternity, <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> it's the end of the show." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Ministry {{frontman}} Al Jourgensen, [...] "We {{hung out}} at Burroughs's house {{one time in}} '93. So he decides to shoot up heroin and he takes out this utility belt full of syringes. Huge, old-fashioned ones from the '50s or something. Now, I {{have no idea how}} an 80 year old guy finds a vein, but {{he knew what he was}} doing. So we're all laying around high and stuff and then <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> in the pile of mail on the coffee table that there's a letter from the White House. I said 'Hey, this looks important.' and he replies 'Nah, it's probably just junk mail.' Well, I open the letter and it's from President Clinton inviting Burroughs to the White House for a poetry reading. I said 'Wow, do you have any idea how big this is!?' So he says 'What? Who's president nowadays?' and it floored me. He didn't even know who our current president was." ...|$|E
2500|$|Paxton {{decided to}} try some more {{elaborate}} recording techniques, including neo-chamber music with string sections, flutes, horns, piano, various session musicians, {{as well as his}} acoustic guitar and vocals, similar to what his labelmate Judy Collins and his friend Phil Ochs were experimenting with around this time. [...] Paxton finally broke into the album pop charts with The Things <b>I</b> <b>Notice</b> Now in the summer of 1969, and also charted with Tom Paxton 6 in the spring of the following year. [...] His song [...] "Whose Garden Was This", an environmentalist anthem written for the first Earth Day, was later recorded by John Denver and became the title track of Denver's 1970 album. [...] The diverse [...] "Baroque Folk" [...] experimentation on Paxton's recordings was basically short-lived though, and he tended to think that the music was becoming too overproduced and away from the more natural acoustic roots that he loved best. [...] Regarding this time, he said, [...] "the acoustic guitar has always been what I loved the most... I know I didn't have that rock mentality or anything. [...] I was still a kid from a small town in Oklahoma. [...] And I just wanted to hear folk songs." [...] Paxton continued to sing and perform his songs on acoustic guitar at his live performances, and it wasn't too long before his albums would once again generally reflect his original traditional-sounding style.|$|E

2500|$|The reredos {{has five}} tiers of figures {{and at the}} bottom some marble reliefs by Westmacott. [...] In the immaculately kept New College Archives {{are a series of}} sepia {{photographs}} of Hitch’s figures taken before they were sent from his workshop near Vauxhall to Oxford and in the archive's record 3140 are letters dated between 1883 and 1892 relating to the reredos and these include several letters written by Hitch himself. Some of these letters show the lengths to which Hitch went to ensure that his statues were true to life. In the instance of the statue of William of Wykeham we read how a mask was made of the Winchester effigy of William of Wykeham and then sent to Hitch so that he could be sure that he achieved an accurate likeness. In looking at the relationship between architect/designer and sculptor one is sometimes struck by {{the way in which the}} architect/designer received credit for a particular work with the sculptor very often getting little or no mention and one letter written by Hitch shows that this did matter to him. [...] In this letter he thanks the addressee for sending him a newspaper cutting, one assumes about the reredos, and notes [...] "They name the architect <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> but not the sculptor." [...] We also learn from these letters of the great care taken in the detail of each of the individual statues. [...] "St Peter carries the keys", [...] "James Minor a club" [...] and [...] "Simon a saw" [...] etc. etc. [...] A photograph of the complete reredos is shown below, another shows some of Hitch's carvings and a close-up of the statue of Moses complete with tablet and horns gives us a good idea of Hitch's ability as a mason.|$|E
