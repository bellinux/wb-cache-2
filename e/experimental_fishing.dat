40|$|Southern Bluefin Tuna (SBT) is a {{depleted}} stock with a rebuilding target and timeframe {{defined by the}} responsible management body (CCSBT). All recent stock assessments {{have found that the}} stock is depleted but large differences exist in estimates of recovery probabilities under current catches. In 1996, CCSBT adopted a set of principles and a process for considering <b>experimental</b> <b>fishing,</b> which are fundamentally consistent with an actively adaptive management policy. Substantial efforts to develop a program in line with these principles did not succeed, partially {{due to the lack of}} a decision-making framework. In 1998 and 1999, Japan conducted unilateral <b>experimental</b> <b>fishing</b> arguing that the additional substantial catches could reduce uncertainty in stock assessments and thus were justified. This led to international legal proceedings under UNCLOS, in which preliminary measures were issued preventing further unilateral <b>experimental</b> <b>fishing</b> (these were later rescinded when an UNCLOS arbitral tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction in the dispute). This decision has been cited as a possible manifestation of industry's "worst fear with the implementation of the precautionary approach". This paper examines the SBT dispute in relationship to adaptive management and the precautionary approach, Results of recent stock assessments indicate that the Japanese <b>experimental</b> <b>fishing,</b> even if successful, was unlikely to resolve the disparity in estimates of the recovery probabilities or provide an improved basis for management decision making. In this context, it is the absence of a management framework, rather than a fundamental problem with adaptive management, that challenges the compatibility of these <b>experimental</b> <b>fishing</b> catches and the precautionary approach.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The aim of {{the studies}} was to {{determine}} the possibility of using a combined rearing system of tanks and illuminated cages for coregonid larvae in eutrophic lake. Studies were carried out in 1990. Tank rearing took place in Dgal Hatchery, cage rearing was performed in eutrophic Lake Leginskie. Increasing the egg incubation temperature, larvae hatching was accelerated about 3 weeks earlier. The larvae were reared on artificial feeds, at 16 ± 1 C, for a period of 19 days. Then they were transferred to il-luminated cages, in which they fed on the zooplankton only. The control group consisted of the larvae ha-tched in the usual period in cold hatcheries, and reared identically as the <b>experimental</b> <b>fish.</b> Cage rearing lasted for 63 days. Growth rate, mortality, LDS and fish biomass were determined throughout of the experiment. The larvae attained the weight of 41 mg at the end of tank rearing. Fry obtained {{at the end of the}} cage rearing weighed from 1732 to 2023 mg (<b>experimental</b> <b>fish)</b> and from 475 to 648 mg (control fish). Stock mortalities amounted from 65 to 80 %. <b>Experimental</b> <b>fish</b> finished their larval development after 42 days, whereas a certain part of control group did not finished their larval development till the end of cage rearing. There were high values of fish biomass in cages in tank-and-cage rearing (from 2. 39 to 3. 24 kg/m 3).

40|$|M. Sc. (Zoology) Tilapia sparrmanii (Smith) {{obtained}} from the Provincial Fishery in Lydenburg was used for toxicological studies. The haematology of T. sparrmanii was investigated after exposure to sub-lethal doses of atrazine, zinc and iron for 72 hours in a continuous flow and static system, as well as prolonged (4 weeks) exposure in the continuous flow system. After exposure {{the blood of the}} <b>experimental</b> <b>fish</b> were sampled. Mean values and standard errors were obtained for several haematological parameters such as number of red and white blood cells, haematocrit, haemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume, pH, plasma glucose-, protein-, lipid- and lactate concentrations, as well as plasma Na+, K+, eland Ca+. Statistically {{significant differences were found between}} the values of haematological parameters of <b>experimental</b> and control <b>fish.</b> A tendency towards haemoconcentration was observed when fish were exposed to the low pollutant concentrations, while signs of haemodilution was found at higher concentrations. The results in this study demonstrate that, after prolonged exposure, T. sparrmanii develops a tolerance and partially recovers from the stress condition. The bioconcentration of atrazine in the blood of T. sparrmanii after exposure were determined by liquid chromatography and zinc and iron by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. During this study it was found that atrazine, zinc and iron concentrated in the blood of T. sparrmanii after short- and prolonged exposure to the pollutants.

40|$|The use {{of species}} habitat {{suitability}} (HS) modelling is increasing as an approach in detecting important areas in integrated coastal zone management. European lobster (Homarus gammarus) is currently listed as near threatened in the Norwegian red list, according to IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) criteria. Past management regimes were insufficient {{to rebuild the}} lobster population after a considerable decline that mainly occurred in the 1960 s and - 70 s. Catch per unit effort (CPUE) has indicated rapid population increase in experimental lobster reserves in Skagerrak, suggesting that marine reserves {{can be an effective}} management tool in successful rebuilding efforts. In the process towards establishing full-scale marine reserves, new methods are addressed to supplement <b>experimental</b> <b>fishing</b> surveys.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the rate absorption of radio-labeled chromium oxide (51 Cr 2 O 3), used as biological marker in nutrition studies with Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus.

At the beginning of the experiment five fish from each group were randomly selected and blood samples were drawn from control (BC) and <b>experimental</b> <b>fish</b> (BE). Fish were then euthanized by anesthetic overdoses and samples of the liver tissue (LT), renal tissue (RT), stomach without content (S), intestine without content (I), gills tissue (GT), muscle tissue (fillet; MT), visceral fat (VF), content of the digestive tract (CTDE) and water aquarium were collected from the <b>experimental</b> <b>fish.</b> The procedure was repeated daily for one week.

The experimental results indicate that the trivalent chromium in the form of 51 Cr 2 O 3 was not significantly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract, gills or another possible route of absorption under these experimental conditions and with Nile tilapia.
