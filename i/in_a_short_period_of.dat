5|$|Larry drifted {{across the}} Isthmus of Tehuantepec, {{dropping}} heavy rainfall of over 9in (229mm) in places. The rainfall led to flooding and mudslides, causing damage {{to thousands of}} houses. The flooding killed five people and resulted in $53.6million (2003USD) in damage. Larry {{was one of three}} tropical cyclones to hit Mexico <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, including Tropical Depression Nora and Tropical Storm Olaf in the eastern Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with the output of pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.|$|E

5|$|The Romans conquered {{much of the}} Levant in 63 BC, inaugurating {{a period}} of Roman rule that lasted for four centuries. In the {{northern}} modern-day Jordan, the Greek cities of Philadelphia (Amman), Gerasa, Gedara, Pella and Arbila joined with other cities in Palestine and Syria; Scythopolis, Hippos, Capitolias, Canatha and Damascus to form the Decapolis League, a fabled confederation linked by bonds of economic and cultural interest. Philadelphia became a point along a road stretching from Ailah to Damascus that was built by Emperor Trajan in 106 AD. This provided an economic boost for the city <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. During the late Byzantine era in the seventh century, several bishops and churches were based in the city.|$|E
5|$|Although later events, {{such as the}} Hillsborough {{disaster}} and the subsequent Taylor Report, vindicated this plan, Rangers were taking a significant risk. The whole plan was estimated to cost £6 million, which no other club could have afforded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. The development {{was funded by the}} Rangers football pools operation, which was the largest club-based scheme in Britain. The first phase of the plan, which began in 1978, was the removal of the east terracing and its replacement with the Copland Road stand. The same process was repeated {{on the west side of}} the ground a year later, with the two identical stands each holding 7,500 seats. The redevelopment was completed in 1981 with the replacement of the Centenary Stand by the 10,300 capacity Govan Stand.|$|E
5|$|The 1984–85 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} an average cyclone season. Tropical {{cyclones}} in this basin are {{monitored by the}} Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Réunion. The first storm formed in mid-November, {{though it was not}} officially named. A few days later, the first official storm of the year (Anety) formed. In December, one storm formed. During January 1985, two tropical cyclones formed {{towards the end of the}} month. Three more systems developed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time in early to mid-February. After nearly two more months of inactivity, an unusually powerful late season storm developed (Helisaonina) in mid-April, which was the strongest storm of the year. While a number of storms during the season reached severe tropical storm status, only one of those intensified further. Even though two tropical cyclones this year made landfall, no known damage was recorded.|$|E

5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, democracy was satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, {{and the fact that}} they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E
5|$|However the ECSC {{failed to}} achieve several {{fundamental}} aims of the Treaty of Paris. It was hoped the ECSC would prevent a resurgence of large coal and steel {{groups such as the}} Konzerne, which helped Adolf Hitler rise to power. In the Cold War trade-offs, the cartels and major companies re-emerged, leading to apparent price fixing (another element that was meant to be tackled). With a democratic supervisory system the worst aspects of past abuse were avoided with the anti-cartel powers of the Authority, the first international anti-cartel agency in the world. Efficient firms were allowed to expand into a European market without undue domination. Oil, gas, electricity became natural competitors to coal and also broke cartel powers. Furthermore, with the move to oil, the Community failed to define a proper energy policy. The Euratom treaty was largely stifled by de Gaulle and the European governments refused the suggestion of an Energy Community involving electricity and other vectors that was suggested at Messina in 1955. In a time of high inflation and monetary instability ECSC also fell short of ensuring an upward equalisation of pay of workers within the market. These failures could be put down to overambition <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time, or that the goals were merely political posturing to be ignored. It has been argued that the greatest achievements of the European Coal and Steel Community lie in its revolutionary democratic concepts of a supranational Community.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{starts in}} a {{courtroom}} where Lisa is on trial. The Blue-Haired Lawyer is accusing her of bringing devastation upon Springfield because of her selfish desire {{to be accepted by}} others. Lisa starts telling everyone in the courtroom about her side of the story. A few months ago, she and her family went to the new mall in town. There, she encountered her schoolmates Sherri and Terri and asked them if she could spend some time with them at the mall. The two twins said no to Lisa, which made her realize that she has no real friends. Later, Lisa went on Homer's computer and discovered that it is easier to make friends online than in real life, and thus she started a social networking website called SpringFace to get friends. The site became instantly popular among all the citizens of Springfield and Lisa made over a thousand friends <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>short</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. However, Lisa soon noticed that these friends only talked to her on SpringFace and not in real life. She also discovered that the website grew too big to control, with people becoming so addicted to it that they even used it while driving their cars. This caused chaos in the town after numerous car crashes and deaths.|$|E
