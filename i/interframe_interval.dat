30|$|The {{choice of}} the length of the {{smoothing}} window W is very important. We choose W equal to the length of a SIFS (for Short IFS), which is the smallest <b>interframe</b> <b>interval.</b> Thus, theoretically, we can not get a set of successive noise samples of a length less than a SIFS. Then, if we met a set of noise-only samples of length less than an SIFS, it means that the algorithm took the wrong decision and Φ(u) will be forced to 1 for those samples.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Elastography is a noninvasive {{method of}} imaging tissue {{elasticity}} using standard ultrasound equipment. In conventional elastography, axial strain elastograms are generated by cross-correlating pre- and postcompression digitized radio frequency (RF) echo frames acquired from the tissue {{before and after}} a small uniaxial compression, respectively. The time elapsed between the pre- and the postcompression frames {{is referred to as}} the <b>interframe</b> <b>interval.</b> For in vivo elastography, the <b>interframe</b> <b>interval</b> is critical because uncontrolled physiologic motion such as heartbeat, muscle motion, respiration and blood flow introduce interframe decorrelation that reduces the quality of elastograms. To obtain a measure of this decorrelation, in vivo experimental data (from human livers and thyroids) at various interframe intervals were obtained from 20 healthy subjects. To further examine the effect of the different interframe intervals on the elastographic image quality, the experimental data were also used in combination with elastographic simulation data. The deterioration of elastographic image quality was objectively evaluated by computing the area under the strain filter (SF) at a given resolution. The experimental results of this study demonstrate a statistical exponential behavior of the temporal decay of the echo signal cross-correlation amplitudes from the in vivo tissues due to uncontrollable motion. The results also indicate that the dynamic range and height of the SF are reduced at increased interfram...|$|E
40|$|The maximum {{displacement}} threshold for direction discrimination (dmax) was determined for single or paired dot targets moving discretely {{against a background}} of dynamic visual noise. dmax rose as the spatial density of noise was reduced, or when the <b>interframe</b> <b>interval</b> was decreased. dmax was greater for dot pairs than for single dots, and rose progressively as the distance between the dots was reduced. dmax was also greater if the orientation of the target dot pairs differed from the orientation of paired dots in the background noise. Dichoptic presentation of the target and background noise allowed the target to be detected with an accuracy that did not depend on displacement...|$|E

40|$|Observers viewed two {{alternating}} frames, each {{consisting of}} three rectangular bars displaced laterally by one cycle in one frame {{with respect to}} the other. At long <b>interframe</b> <b>intervals</b> (IFIs) observers perceived a group of three bars moving as a whole (group motion), and at short IFIs the overlapping elements in the two frames appeared stationary, while the third element appeared to move {{from one end of the}} display to the other (element motion). The upper temporal limit for perceiving element motion was reduced when bars with blurred edges were used and when either frame duration or bar size was increased. However, when inner and outer elements had different sizes, the element motion percept was dominant up to 230 ms IFI. These findings may be interpreted in terms of spatial tuning of motion mechanisms involved in the perception of bistable apparent motion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Twelve {{observers}} viewed two alternating frames, each {{consisting of}} three rectangular bars which were displaced laterally by one cycle in one frame {{with respect to}} the other. At long <b>interframe</b> <b>intervals</b> (IFIs) observers perceived a group of three elements moving as a whole (group movement), whereas with IFIs shorter than 40 - 60 ms the overlapping elements in each frame appeared stationary while the third element appeared to move {{from one end of the}} display to the other (end-to-end movement). The percentage of group movement responses in central viewing was compared to those obtained for stimulus presentation in the left and right visual fields (4 deg eccentricity), for opposite horizontal directions of motion. All ten right-handed subjects showed a left-field advantage in sensitivity to group movement. The two left-handed subjects showed a similar advantage in sensitivity with right-field presentation. The effects of monocular vision, hand used in the task, spatial frequency, and contrast on visual field asymmetry were all investigated in two right-handed subjects. None of these factors affected the left- right asymmetry. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigation}} of the fine structure of fast Z-pinches is one of major trends in phys-ics of plasma x-ray radiation sources. Here we present here the results of analysis, {{with the help of}} formerly designed method of multilevel dynamical contrasting (MDC) [1], of the plasma images taken in the facility C- 300 under condition of 1 - 3 MA electric currents for current growth front of ~ 100 ns duration. The load was a tailored cylinder (8 mm long, 3 - 5 mm in diameter, with a neck of ~ 1 mm diameter), made of agar-agar with various heavy-element filling. The analyzed images were taken with the help of electronic optical converters (exposure 3 ns, <b>interframe</b> <b>interval</b> 15 ns, spatial resolution 50 - 100 mcm). In a single discharge, from 3 to 5 images were successively taken in the visible light and/or soft x-rays (SXR), with covering a part of vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral range. This en-abled us to (i) observe the long-lived skeletal structures (SSs) in plasma, (ii) reveal the continuity of SS in the core and periphery, (iii) roughly trace dynamics of SS during the entire discharge, (iv) resolve the fine structure of SS. The results of analyzing the plasma images suggest the presence of filamenatry structures in the plasma of a fast Z-pinch, with the properties of these structures bein...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a microparticle delivery device that generates a plasma jet through laser ablation of a thin metal foil {{and uses the}} jet to accomplish particle delivery into soft living targets for transferring biological agents. Pure gold microparticles of 1 µm size were coated with a plasmid DNA, pIG 121 Hm, and were deposited as a thin layer on one surface of an aluminum foil. The laser (Nd:YAG, 1064 nm wavelength) ablation of the foil generated a plasma jet that carried the DNA coated particles into the living onion cells. The particles could effectively penetrate the target cells and disseminate the DNA, effecting the transfection of the cells. Generation of the plasma jet on laser ablation of the foil and {{its role as a}} carrier of microparticles was visualized using a high-speed video camera, Shimadzu HPV- 1, at a frame rate of 500 kfps (2 µs <b>interframe</b> <b>interval)</b> in a shadowgraph optical set-up. The particle speed could be measured from the visualized images, which was about 770 m/s initially, increased to a magnitude of 1320 m/s, and after a quasi-steady state over a distance of 10 mm with an average magnitude of 1100 m/s, started declining, which typically is the trend of a high-speed, pulsed, compressible jet. Aluminum launch pad (for the particles) was {{used in the present study}} to make the procedure cost-effective, whereas the guided, biocompatible launch pads made of gold, silver or titanium can be used in the device during the actual clinical operations. The particle delivery device has a potential to have a miniature form and can be an effective, hand-held drug/DNA delivery device for biological applications...|$|E
40|$|We present psychophysical {{experiments}} {{designed to}} reveal the role of facilitative contour interactions (the so-called 'association field') in apparent motion. We use the Ternus display (a trio of horizontally aligned elements oscillating in apparent motion). This display is perceived in 'element' motion when <b>interframe</b> <b>intervals</b> (IFIs) are short, and in 'group' motion when IFIs are long. Using Gabor elements arranged collinearly or in parallel, IFI is varied to find group motion thresholds. Consistent with a role for collinearity in perceptual grouping, thresholds are lower for collinear displays. The collinear vs. parallel comparison is made while manipulating contrast, spatial frequency, eccentricity, phase, orientation jitter and element separation. Results show a clear effect of contrast not observed in lateral masking paradigms or in 'pathfinder' stimuli, with higher contrast promoting within-frame grouping, and evidence of facilitatory interactions among parallel elements (although over a smaller scale). The tendency for collinear displays to group more than parallel displays declined with eccentricity with no clear difference evident at 12 deg. These changes in group motion thresholds indicate changing association strengths among the elements and is accounted for {{in terms of an}} association field. Alternative accounts in terms of second-order collector units or visible persistence are considered but are not supported by the data...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{approach}} for the time-resolved analysis of high-speed sequences of particle images is presented. The proposed method aims at the minimization of PIV {{errors in the}} lower velocity range by adjusting locally and dynamically the <b>interframe</b> time <b>interval</b> of the PIV pairs in a recorded high-speed sequence. The algorithm performs the operation on a local basis, thus providing {{the same level of}} accuracy across the full velocity dynamic range of the flow. The present results indicate a greater performance than state-of-the-art PIV analysis based on multi-grid offset PIV and is successfully applied to synthetic and real flow cases. Figure 1 shows the application of the adaptive multi-frame PIV (AMF-PIV) algorithm to a cross-flow jet.

30|$|The IEEE 802.11 MAC {{protocol}} is the CSMA/CA-based contention-based {{access scheme}} [24]. In this protocol, a WLAN node needs {{to sense the}} channel while performing backoff, which is described in the following. If a channel is sensed idle during a Distributed <b>Interframe</b> Space (DIFS) <b>interval,</b> the node proceeds to perform backoff; otherwise, it defers its operation in the current busy period. When the channel is sensed idle for a DIFS interval, the node generates the random backoff delay uniformly chosen in the interval [0, CW- 1] and starts counting down while listening to the medium.|$|R
30|$|Initially, the {{contention}} window size CW is set {{equal to the}} minimum value CWmin. The node decreases its backoff timer by one for every silent time slot period. Moreover, the backoff timer is suspended {{as long as the}} channel is sensed busy (there are transmissions from other nodes). The decrease of the backoff timer is resumed when a channel is sensed idle for a DIFS interval. When the backoff timer reaches zero, the node begins to transmit its packet. If the destination node receives a packet successfully, it waits for a Short <b>Interframe</b> Space (SIFS) <b>interval,</b> and then sends an ACK to the source node.|$|R
