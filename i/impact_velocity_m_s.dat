The centimeter-sized highly porous bodies are produced by random ballistic deposition from individual micrometer-sized dust particles. We find packing densities between 0. 07 and 0. 15 for uncompressed samples, dependent on the shape and size distribution of the constituent dust grains. Impacts into these bodies are simulated by uniaxial compression experiments. We find that themaximum compression, equivalent to the highest protoplanetary <b>impact</b> <b>velocities</b> of 50 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 1, increases the pack-ing density to 0. 20 – 0. 33. Tensile strength measurements with our laboratory samples yield values in the range 200 – 1100 Pa for slightly compressed samples.

We find a consistency between packing densities and tensile strengths of our laboratory samples with those from cometary origin.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the solid particle erosion behaviour of boron phosphide coatings deposited onto AISI type 316 stainless steel substrates. The coatings, which were 20 – 28 ?m in thickness, were tested under low <b>velocity</b> <b>impact</b> (33 <b>m</b> <b>s?</b> 1) in an air–sand erosion rig {{and the damage}} features were studied {{in order to determine}} the erosion mechanisms. The results show that the particle impacts cause the initiation and propagation of radial and lateral cracks, which leads to a gradual removal of the coating. Hertzian ring cracks are also observed, although they are fewer in number. Comparison of the ring crack diameters with Hertz theory reveals close agreement between theory and experiment. Also significant is the finding that the maximum sub-surface shear stress, which is generated by particle impacts, is close to the coating–substrate interface: this partially explains the rapid failure of the coating. It is thought that increasing the coating thickness and/or employing a harder substrate may improve the erosion resistance of the coating. However, the effect that these changes may have on the residual stresses and coating adhesion must be fully evaluated...|$|R

Due to the increase of costs for controlled umping and transport and more severe environmental legislation the need for decreased sludge volumes is rising. Filtration and expression are the cheapest dewatering operations and it is therefore desirable to remove the maximal feasible amount of water by mechanical dewatering. High dry solids contents of 35 - 40 wt % can already be reached at pressures of 300 - 400 kPa and optimal flocculation conditions; however at pressures of 6 [...] 10 MPa dry solids contents of 60 wt % can be reached. Further the modelling of the dewatering is discussed; model and experiment show acceptable agreement.

40|$|Modelling of mass {{transfer}} of particles to solid surfaces {{is a considerable}} challenge in most industrial processes. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) directly on these applications is very challenging and costly due to the grid refinement required to capture the complex physical processes that dominate in the near-wall region. We propose a detailed boundary layer model, which can couple the detailed physics in the wall region with the external flow. This mass-transfer wall function can be applied as a boundary condition for coarse grid CFD models. The detailed boundary layer model incorporates external forces, turbulence and hydrodynamic lift and drag. In addition we include the effects of Brownian diffusion, thermophoresis, XDLVO forces and the inter-particle collisions. The particle deposition flux to the wall is modified with an effective adhesion probability, caused by the adhesive forces and the turbulent shear stress statistics.

With this large diameter soft Hopkinson bar, tests under two different configurations (pressure bar behind / ahead of the supposed shock front) at the same impact speed are used to obtain the force / time histories behind and ahead of the assumed shock front within the cellular material specimen. Stress jumps (up to 60 % of initial stress level) as well as shock front speed are measured for tests at 55 <b>m</b> / <b>s</b> on Alporas foams and nickel hollow sphere agglomerates, whereas no significant shock enhancement is observed for Cymat foams and 5056 aluminium honeycombs.

A photomechanical measurement of the shock front speed is also proposed to obtain a direct experimental proof. The displacement and strain fields during the test are obtained by correlating images shot with a high speed camera. The strain field measurements at different times show that the shock front discontinuity propagates and allows for the measurement of the propagation velocity.

The user effort and wheelchair mechanical efficiency during motion are highly affected by rolling resistance, which is a resistive force depending on many factors such as vehicle speed, tire/floor materials and tire inflation pressure. The study of this force over several conditions could lead to improvements in wheelchair design. The Anatomical Model Propulsion System (AMPS) is a robotic device to test manual wheelchairs with better repeatability than human subjects, helping to identify the effect of resistive forces. It uses electric motors to apply torque directly to the rear wheel handrims. In this thesis, a control system is developed to achieve a specified wheelchair trajectory and velocity profile, by controlling the input torque to the system. A kinetic and dynamic model is used to estimate this necessary input. Data collected from different experiments allows to determine rolling resistance under various conditions.

Since the mean rotation velocity is of order 8 km/s for an M 6 V star and 15 km/s by M 9 V, we avoid observing only slow rotators that would introduce a bias towards low axial inclination i << 90 deg systems, which are unfavourable for planet detection. Our targets with the highest vsini values exhibit radial velocities significantly above the photon-noise limited precision, even after accounting for vsini.

Model outputs are compared with observations made at two coastal locations, D 17 and D 47, situated respectively 10 and 100 km inland. Wind speed was correctly simulated with positive values of the Nash test (0. 60 for D 17 and 0. 37 for D 47) but wind <b>velocities</b> above 10 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> − 1 were underestimated at both D 17 and D 47; at D 47, the model consistently underestimated wind <b>velocity</b> by 2 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> − 1. Aeolian snow transport events were correctly reproduced with the right timing and a good temporal resolution at both locations except when the maximum particle height was less than 1 m.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work has been to investigate {{the applicability of the}} gas gun to study the armature-rail interface wear characteristics relevant to rail gun operations. The approach involved developing constitutive models for armature materials (aluminum 6061) as well as oxygen-free high-thermal conductivity copper as the rail material. Taylor rod-on-anvil impact experiments were performed to validate the accuracy of constitutive strength models by correlating predictions of dynamic simulations in ANSYS AUTODYN with experimental observations. An optical comparator was used to discretize the cross sectional deformation profile of each rod-shaped sample. Parameters of the Johnson-Cook strength model were adjusted for each material to match deformation profiles obtained from simulations with profiles obtained from impact experiments. The fitted Johnson-Cook model parameters for each material were able to give overall deformed length and diameter values within 2 % of the experimentally observed data. Additional simulations were then used with the validated strength model parameters to design the geometry involving cylindrical rods of armature material accelerated through a concentric cylindrical extrusion die made of copper, to emulate the interface wear effects produced in a rail gun operation. Experiments were conducted using this geometry and employing both the 7. 62 mm and 80 mm diameter gas guns. Microstructural analysis was conducted on interfaces of the recovered samples from both designs. Hardness measurements were also performed along the interface layer to evaluate the structure formation due to solid-state wear or melt formation. The stress and strain conditions resulting in the observed microstructural effects were correlated with predictions from numerical simulations performed using the validated material models. The overall results illustrate that the stress-strain conditions produced during acceleration of Al through hollow concentric copper extrusion die, result in interface deformation and wear characteristics that are influenced by velocity. At velocities (less than 800 m/s), interface wear leads to formation of layer dominated by solid-state alloying of Cu and Al, while higher velocities produce a melted and re-solidified aluminum layer. Hence, use of different armature (Al-based) and rail (Cu-based) materials can be evaluated with the gas-gun set-up employed in the current work to study the effects of interface wear ranging from formation melt layer to solid-state alloying as a function of material properties and <b>velocity.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>S.</b> Committee Chair: Dr. Thadhani; Committee Member: Dr. Cowan; Committee Member: Dr. Danyluk; Committee Member: Dr. Rose...|$|R

Based on velocity data and estimates of flow density, the values of impact pressure on rigid structures (i. e. buildings) were assessed through the calculation of hydrostatic pressure and dynamic overpressure. The data from the study area show that at flow velocities s 4 ^ 5 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 31 the dynamic overpressure accounts for most of the observed damage, whereas at lower velocities the contributions of the hydrostatic and dynamic pressures become similar. The comparisons between the calculated impact pressures and the damage on structures show that for loading s 35 kPa (<b>velocity</b> <b>s</b> 3 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 31) most of buildings were destroyed or severely damaged. For values 6 35 kPa only minor damage occurred to the structures. Finally, an empirical law for the assessment of impact pressure on spreading areas was presented, useful for hazard zonation in similar geomorphologic settings...|$|R

The objective is to validate the numerical model by comparing the predictions with experimental measurements of a well defined evaporating spray configuration (Chen et al., Int. J. Multiphase Flow 32 (2006), 389 – 412). The carrier-phase is considered in the Eulerian context, while the dispersed phase is tracked in the Lagrangian framework. Various interactions between the two phases {{are taken into account}} by means of a two-way coupling. The stochastic separated flow (SSF) model is adopted for the spray calculations. The gas-phase turbulence terms are closed using the standard k-ε model. The spray evaporation is described using a thermal model with an infinite-conductivity. Overall, very good agreement is observed in the comparisons of the computational predictions and experimental measurements. The predicted droplet number-mean axial <b>velocity,</b> r. <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> of fluctuating <b>velocity</b> for the various droplet classes at different downstream locations exhibit a self-similarity downstream of the nozzle exit. Near the nozzle-exit (around z/djet = 5), the r. <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> of droplet number mean axial fluctuating velocity attains a maximum within the shear layer near r/djet = 0. 4 – 0. 6 for different droplet classes. Further downstream, the peak shifts towards the axis. A similar variation is noticed in the Sauter mean diameter (SMD) distribution of the droplets. It is concluded that, a higher level of turbulence leads to a faster depletion of the smaller droplets, resulting in an increase in the local droplet-SMD in those regions...|$|R
40|$|After a short {{description}} of the physical phenomena involved, unified expressions are worked out describing net airflow and net heat flow through large vertical openings between stratified zones. These formulae are based on those of Cockroft for bidirectional flow, but are more general {{in the sense that}} they apply to situations of unidirectional flow as well. The expressions are compatible with a pressure network description for multizone modelling of airflow in buildings. The technique has been incorporated in the flows solver of the ESP-r building and plant energy simulation environment. The relative importance of the governing variables (pressure difference, temperature difference and vertical air temperature gradients) is demonstrated by parametric analysis of energy performance in a typical building context. It is concluded that vertical air temperature gradients have a major influence on the heat transferred through large openings in buildings and should be included in building energy simulation models.

40|$|International audienceDeposition of {{inertial}} solid particles {{transported by}} turbulent flows is modelled in {{a framework of}} a statistical approach based on the particle velocity Probability Density Function (PDF). The particle-turbulence interaction term is closed in the kinetic equation by a model widely inspired from the famous BGK model of the kinetic theory of rarefied gases. A Gauss-Hermite Lattice Boltzmann model is used to solve the closed kinetic equation involving the turbulence effect. The Lattice Boltzmann model {{is used for the}} case of the deposition of inertial particles transported by a homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. Even if the carrier phase is homogeneous and isotropic, the presence of the wall coupled with particle-turbulence interactions leads to inhomogeneous particle distribution and non-equilibrium particle fluctuating motion. Despite these complexities the predictions of the Lattice Boltzmann model are in very good accordance with random-walk simulations. More specifically the mean particle <b>velocity,</b> the r. <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> particle <b>velocity</b> and the deposition rate are all well predicted by the proposed Lattice Boltzmann model...|$|R
40|$|Walking is a {{basic form}} of {{locomotion}} and walking velocity is a good predictor of human health, with faster velocities indicating better health. While faster walking velocities {{have been attributed to}} overall increases in lower extremity joint torques and powers, the precise relationships of torque and power outputs at each joint to walking velocity remain elusive. We proposed that these relationships are fundamental in developing effective training programs aimed at increasing walking velocity in mobility-challenged populations such as older adults. Based on the previously established argument that aging induces asymmetric changes in joint torques and powers, we hypothesized that walking velocity is more strongly related to hip torque and power than ankle torque and power in old adults than young adults. The {{purpose of this study was}} to identify the relationships among maximum, sagittal plane hip, knee, and ankle joint torques and powers and walking velocity in young and old, healthy adults in order to identify biomechanical correlates associated with modulating walking velocity. Gait biomechanics were collected using 8 camera 3 D motion capture and force platform systems. Twenty-two young healthy adults and twenty-two old healthy adults each walked at 20 speeds ranging from relatively slow to relatively fast velocities. Maximum sagittal plane joint torques and powers derived through inverse dynamics were correlated to walking velocity (p< 0. 05). The data showed that all peak torques and powers were significantly (p< 0. 05) and directly related to walking velocity. Hip and ankle relations were curvilinear upward and downward; knee were linear. Peak joint torques showed proximal to distal decrease in the strength of their relationships. Peak joint powers were similarly related to walking velocity at each joint. In old adults, torques were most strongly related to walking velocity at the proximal hip (R²= 0. 761) and decreased distally to the ankle (R²= 0. 275); powers were similar to walking velocity across the hip (R²= 0. 467) and the ankle (R²= 0. 445). In young adults, torques were also most strongly related to the walking velocity at the proximal hip (R²= 0. 747) and decreased distally to the ankle (R²= 0. 289); powers were similarly related to walking velocity across the hip (R²= 0. 601) than to the ankle (R²= 0. 528). Overall, mechanical output at the hip was the primary biomechanical correlate of walking velocity, whereas mechanical output at the ankle was most weakly correlated to walking velocity. This pattern of modulating walking velocity is used by both young and old adults similarly. Therefore, the hypothesis was refuted, as aging does not cause a mechanical plasticity in relation to walking <b>velocity.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>S...</b>|$|R

A least-squares orbital solution using robust estimation yields orbital parameters of period yr, <b>velocity</b> amplitude <b>m</b> <b>s</b> 21, ec-P p 6. 9 K p 19 centricity, projected companion mass, and semimajor axis AU.

If magnetic activity {{were responsible for the}} RV variations, then it produces a significantly different period than is seen in the Ca ii data. Given the lack of Ca ii variation with the same period as that found in the RV measurements, the long-lived and coherent nature of these variations, and the high eccentricity of the implied orbit, Keplerian motion due to a planetary companion seems to be the most likely explanation for the observed RV variations. The wide angular separation of the planet from the star (approximately 10) and the long orbital period make this planet a prime candidate for both direct imaging and space-based astrometric measurements...|$|R

The influence of the electrical polarization fields caused by charges at the horizontal edges of the sporadic layers and the finite conductivity of the external circuits are also taken into account. The theoretical model is applicable for ionospheric altitudes between 95 and 130 km. The estimates show that under certain conditions in a system with two sporadic E -layers, one of which is the current generator and the other is situated in the external circuit, the Farley-Buneman instability could be generated. On the other hand, observations show that Farley-Buneman waves are likely responsible for the infrequent echoes of mid-latitude 50 -MHz backscatter with Doppler <b>velocities</b> near 300 <b>m</b> <b>s</b> ? 1.
