5|$|Due to its {{location}} at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This {{means that it}} is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling.|$|E

40|$|International audienceImmune {{thrombocytopenia}} (ITP) {{can become}} a life-threatening condition that requires immediate medical attention. The loss in platelet numbers during ITP can be induced {{by a variety of}} triggers. Anti-platelet antibodies of several isotypes and subclasses are a major cause for ITP and are a hallmark of many complex autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Mouse models have <b>been</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the effector pathways involved in antibody-mediated platelet depletion. Therapeutic interventions based on these results have been proven successful in treating human ITP, thus validating the use of these model systems. One major problem that remains to be answered is which cell populations are crucial for platelet removal. Targeting these cells directly might be a novel therapeutic strategy and will also <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the underlying biological mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{some issues}} raised by Rosa Luxemburg's theory of imperialism that are central to current debates on globalisation. Methodologically, despite widespread scepticism {{on the use of}} mathematics in Marxist social science, Luxemburg's rigorous analysis of Marx's schemes of reproduction forcefully shows the importance of theoretical abstraction and formal modelling. Indeed, this paper analyses Luxemburg's theory by means of an intertemporal generalisation of Roemer's (1983) economy with a global capital market. It focuses in particular on two substantive issues: the relation between capital accumulation and imperialism, and the role of force and non-competitive distortions in imperialistic international relations. It argues that differences in development and competitive credit markets, rather than realisation problems, <b>are</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the emergence of international exploitation, whereas extra-economic coercion may <b>be</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> its persistence. ...|$|R

It has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers, while reducing energy consumption.|$|E

25|$|Because {{there are}} often many {{different}} possible coordinate systems for describing geometrical figures, it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> how they are related. Such relations are described by coordinate transformations which give formulas for the coordinates in one system {{in terms of the}} coordinates in another system. For example, in the plane, if Cartesian coordinates (x,y) and polar coordinates (r,θ) have the same origin, and the polar axis is the positive x axis, then the coordinate transformation from polar to Cartesian coordinates is given by x=rcosθ and y=rsinθ.|$|E

Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.|$|E

25|$|The goal {{of local}} helioseismology, a term first used in 1993, is to {{interpret}} the full wave field observed at the surface, not just the mode (more precisely, eigenmode) frequencies. Another {{way to look at}} it, is that global helioseismology studies standing waves of the entire Sun and local helioseismology studies propagating waves in parts of the Sun. A variety of solar phenomena are being studied, including sunspots, plage, supergranulation, giant cell convection, magnetically active region evolution, meridional circulation, and solar rotation. Local helioseismology provides a three-dimensional view of the solar interior, which <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> large-scale flows, magnetic structures, and their interactions in the solar interior.|$|E
25|$|Difficulties with standing, walking, turning corners, {{climbing}} stairs, and a slowing of gait {{are experienced}} as astronauts re-adapt to Earth's gravity, until terrestrial motor strategies are fully re-acquired. Adaptation to spaceflight also induces {{a significant increase}} in the time required to traverse an obstacle course on landing day, and recovery of functional mobility takes an average of two weeks. These difficulties can have adverse consequences for an astronauts’ ability to stand up or escape from the vehicle during emergencies and to function effectively immediately after leaving the spacecraft after flight. Thus it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> the cause of these profound impairments of posture and locomotion stability, and develop countermeasures.|$|E
25|$|A {{practical}} {{method for}} investigating neutrino oscillations was first suggested by Bruno Pontecorvo in 1957 using an analogy with kaon oscillations; over the subsequent 10 years {{he developed the}} mathematical formalism and the modern formulation of vacuum oscillations. In 1985 Stanislav Mikheyev and Alexei Smirnov (expanding on 1978 work by Lincoln Wolfenstein) noted that flavor oscillations can be modified when neutrinos propagate through matter. This so-called Mikheyev–Smirnov–Wolfenstein effect (MSW effect) <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> because many neutrinos emitted by fusion in the Sun pass through the dense matter in the solar core (where essentially all solar fusion takes place) {{on their way to}} detectors on Earth.|$|E
