Five minutes afterwards {{she said}} to Olive that if it would give her pleasure they would leave New York on the morrow, without taking a fourth day; {{and as soon as}} she had done so she felt better, especially when she saw how gratefully Olive looked at her for the concession, how eagerly she rose to the offer in saying, [...] "Well, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>feel</b> that it isn't our own life--our very own!" [...] It was with these words, and others besides, and with an unusually weak, indefinite kiss, as if she wished to protest that, after all, a single day didn't matter, and yet accepted the sacrifice and was a little ashamed of it--it was in this manner that the agreement as to an immediate retreat was sealed. Verena could not shut her eyes to the fact that for a month she had been less frank, and if she wished to do penance this abbreviation of their pleasure in New York, even if it made her almost completely miss Basil Ransom, was easier than to tell Olive just now that the letter was not all, {{that there had been a}} long visit, a talk, and a walk besides, which she had been covering up for ever so many weeks. And of what consequence, anyway, was the missing? Was it such a pleasure to converse with a gentleman who only wanted to let you know--and why he should want it so much Verena couldn't guess--that he thought you quite preposterous? Olive took her from place to place, and she ended by forgetting everything but the present hour, and the bigness and variety of New York, and the entertainment of rolling about in a carriage with silk cushions, and meeting new faces, new expressions of curiosity and sympathy, assurances that one was watched and followed. Mingled with this was a bright consciousness, sufficient for the moment, that one was moreover to dine at Delmonico's and go to the German opera. There was enough of the epicurean in Verena's composition to make it easy for her in certain conditions to live only for the hour.|$|E

5000|$|A life-long Christian, Horne has {{described}} {{growing up in}} a religious household in Etne, a community of both meeting houses and Gospel Halls in addition to the official church, as well as attending Sunday school where her father was a teacher for over thirty years. About the importance of her faith, she has stated: [...] "In a busy life, it is not so easy to have [...] "close contact" [...] with God, but I think that being able to send some thoughts Upwards occasionally, both in good as well as in difficult times, is a strength, knowing that there is always someone who loves me and who is always there, even <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>feel</b> and know it." ...|$|R
60|$|It is {{here that}} those who explain this modern religiosity will seem most {{arbitrary}} to the inquirer. For they relate of God, as men will relate of a close friend, his dispositions, his apparent intentions, the aims of his kingship. And just as they advance no proof whatever {{of the existence of}} God but their realisation of him, so with regard to these qualities and dispositions they have little argument but profound conviction. What they say is this; that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>feel</b> God then there is no persuading you of him; we cannot win over the incredulous. And what they say of his qualities is this; that <b>if</b> <b>you</b> feel God then you will know, you will realise more and more clearly, that thus and thus and no other is his method and intention.|$|R

More advanced usage of Sage has been demonstrated using a Sage compatible version of Paraview highlighting the potential of parallel rendering. The aim of this tutorial session is to give a practical introduction to developing visual content for a tiled display using the Sage libraries. After completing this tutorial you should have the basic tools required to develop your own custom Sage applications. This tutorial is designed for software developers and intermediate programming knowledge is assumed, along with some introductory OpenGL.

60|$|Equal {{justice to}} the South, it is said, {{requires}} us to consent to the extension of slavery to new countries. That is to say, inasmuch as <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not object to my taking my hog to Nebraska, therefore I must not object to your taking your slave. Now, I admit that this is perfectly logical {{if there is no}} difference between hogs and negroes. But while you thus require me to deny the humanity of the negro, I wish to ask whether you of the South, yourselves, have ever been willing to do as much? It is kindly provided that of all those who come into the world only a small percentage are natural tyrants. That percentage is no larger in the slave States than in the free. The great majority South, as well as North, have human sympathies, of which they can no more divest themselves than they can of their sensibility to physical pain. These sympathies in the bosoms of the Southern people manifest, in many ways, their sense of the wrong of slavery, and their consciousness that, after all, there is humanity in the negro. If they deny this, let me address them a few plain questions. In 1820 you (the South) joined the North, almost unanimously, in declaring the African slave trade piracy, and in annexing to it the punishment of death. Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> this? <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>did</b> not <b>feel</b> that it was wrong, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> join in providing that men should be hung for it?

"Mysteries {{they may}} well be called," [...] {{continued}} the barber, with rising spirits {{at the prospect of}} a long monologue, as he imprisoned the young Greek in the shroud-like shaving-cloth; [...] "mysteries of Minerva and the Graces. I get the flower of men's thoughts, because I seize them in the first moment after shaving. (Ah! you wince a little at the lather: it tickles the outlying limits of the nose, I admit.) And that is what makes the peculiar fitness of a barber's shop to become a resort of wit and learning. For, look now at a druggist's shop: there is a dull conclave at the sign of `The Moor,' that pretends to rival mine; but what sort of inspiration, I beseech you, can be got from the scent of nauseous vegetable decoctions?--to say nothing {{of the fact that you}} no sooner pass the threshold than you see a doctor of physic, like a gigantic spider disguised in fur and scarlet, waiting for his prey; or even see him blocking up the doorway seated on a bony hack, inspecting saliva. (Your chin a little elevated, if it please you: contemplate that angel who is blowing the trumpet at you from the ceiling. I had it painted expressly for the regulation of my clients' chins.) Besides, your druggist, who herborises and decocts, is a man of prejudices: he has poisoned people according to a system, and is obliged to stand up for his system to justify the consequences. Now a barber can be dispassionate; the only thing he necessarily stands by is the razor, always providing he is not an author. That was the flaw in my great predecessor Burchiello: he was a poet, and had consequently a prejudice about his own poetry. I have escaped that; I saw very early that authorship is a narrowing business, in conflict with the liberal art of the razor, which demands an impartial affection for all men's chins. Ecco, Messer! the outline of your chin and lip is as clear as a maiden's; and now fix your mind on a knotty question--ask yourself whether you are bound to spell Virgil with an i or an e, and say <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>feel</b> an unwonted clearness on the point. Only, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> decide for the i, keep it to yourself till your fortune is made, for the e hath the stronger following in Florence. Ah! I think I see a gleam of still quicker wit in your eye. I have it on the authority of our young Niccolo Macchiavelli, himself keen enough to discern il pelo nell' uovo, as we say, and a great lover of delicate shaving, though his beard is hardly of two years' date, that no sooner do the hairs begin to push themselves, than he perceives a certain grossness of apprehension creeping over him." ...|$|R
