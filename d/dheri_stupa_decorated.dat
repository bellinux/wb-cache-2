50|$|Gandhāra is {{also thought}} to be the {{location}} of the mythical Lake Dhanakosha, the birthplace of Padmasambhava, the founder of Tibetan Buddhism. The bKa' brgyud (Kagyu) sect of Tibetan Buddhism identifies the lake with the Andan <b>Dheri</b> <b>stupa</b> ("mound"), located near the tiny village of Uchh near Chakdara in the lower Swat Valley. A spring was said to flow {{from the base of the}} stupa to form the lake. Archaeologists have found the stupa but no spring or lake can be identified.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the roof}} upper parts is missing. Judging from the {{existing}} parts, experts suggested that the roof was crowned with <b>stupa</b> <b>decorated</b> with floral patterns.|$|R
50|$|The great stupa at Nagarjunakonda {{belongs to}} the class of uncased stupas, its {{brickwork}} being plastered over and the <b>stupa</b> <b>decorated</b> by a large garland-ornament. The original stupa was renovated by the Ikshvaku princess Chamtisiri in the 3rd century AD, when ayaka-pillars of stone were erected. The outer railing, if any, was of wood, its uprights erected over a brick plinth. The stupa, 32.3 m in diameter, rose to a height of 18 m with a 4 m wide circumambulatory. The medhi stood 1.5 m and the ayaka-platforms were rectangular offsets measuring 6.7 by 1.5 m.|$|R
5000|$|According to Amit Jha, a {{lecturer}} in the Department of History at Sri Aurobindo College, Delhi University, [...] "Ratnagiri comprises two magnificent monasteries, also rebuilt more than once. One of them was double-storyed and had an extensive courtyard with two sides of it having a number of cells for habitation of monks. Besides, we have archaeological remains of six temples, thousands of small stupas, 1386 seals, myriad sculptural relics and architectural pieces of daily use. The largest stupa was 47 ft square and 17 ft high surrounded by four minor stupas. There are hundreds of miniature votive <b>stupas</b> <b>decorated</b> with lotus petals and beaded tassels." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{decoration}} of the stupa provides an interesting case of Greco-Buddhist art, combining Hellenistic and Indian artistic elements. The reconstitution consists of several parts, the <b>decorated</b> <b>stupa</b> base, the canopy, and various decorative elements.|$|R
25|$|The Satavahana rulers {{are also}} {{remarkable}} {{for their contributions}} to Buddhist art and architecture. They built great stupas in the Krishna River Valley, including the stupa at Amaravati in Andhra Pradesh. The <b>stupas</b> were <b>decorated</b> in marble slabs and sculpted with scenes {{from the life of}} the Buddha, portrayed in a characteristic slim and elegant style. The Amaravati style of sculpture also influenced the sculpture of Southeast Asia.|$|R
5000|$|Kalutara or Gangatilaka Vihara {{was built}} in the 1960s to the south of the Kalutara Bridge, is Kalutara’s most {{dominant}} landmark. The white 3 storeys-high dagoba at Kalutara Vihara {{is believed to be the}} only Buddha Stupa in the world which is entirely hollow. It contains a smaller dagoba inside. The interior of the <b>Stupa</b> is <b>decorated</b> with paintings of the Jataka tales about the life of the Buddha.|$|R
5000|$|Drowai Gonpo was {{a son of}} {{the ruler}} Ngawang Tashi Drakpa (d. 1564), the last {{important}} leader of the dynasty and known by the Fifth Dalai Lama as the [...] "King of Tibet". His mother was a lady of the Rinpungpa family, which was dominant in the Tsang region of West Central Tibet. In 1524 Drowai Gonpo was established as sub-ruler in Gongri Karpo {{to the west of}} the Nêdong palace where his father dwelt. Like his father he received the royal title gongma, [...] "the high one". He married a lady from Chontse who gave birth to Ngawang Drakpa Gyaltsen. In another marriage, with a daughter of the Ganden lord, he sired Sonam Drakpa Gyaltsen (d. 1566?) and Namgyal Rabten (d. 1568?). The move of a part of the Phagmodrupa family to Gongri Karpo caused serious internal feuds in the dynasty, some years after the death of Drowai Gonpo (1548). This led to the complete eclipse of Phagmodrupa power in Central Tibet. After the demise of Drowai Gonpo, a <b>stupa</b> <b>decorated</b> with jewels was erected at Gongri Karpo to contain his remains.|$|R
5000|$|General John Jacob, {{the acting}} British Commissioner in Sindh {{was first to}} be {{attracted}} to the site in the 19th century. His excavations found a vase of fine earthenware containing some pieces of crystal and amethyst, which {{was sent to the}} Karachi Museum. The <b>stupa</b> was <b>decorated</b> using terracotta sculptures representing the Buddha.> The artwork is similar to that seen at Sarnath and at Mathura. Clay tablets containing the Buddhist formula [...] "Ye Dharma Hetu" [...] in 7th-8th script were also found.|$|R
50|$|Sand {{is brought}} to the temple grounds and is made into stupas or mounds, then {{decorated}} before being given to the monks {{as a way of}} making merit. There are two ways to make the sand stupas. One way is to go to the beach, and the other way is to bring sand to the vat, or temple. Sand <b>stupas</b> are <b>decorated</b> with flags, flowers, white lines, and splashed with perfumed water. Sand stupas symbolize the mountain, Phoukhao Kailat, where King Kabinlaphrôm's head was kept by his seven daughters.|$|R
50|$|Tepe Shortor is a Buddhist monastery and stupa complex {{located at}} Hadda that was {{excavated}} between 1974 and 1979 by Afghan, and later French, archeologists. It is positioned midpoint {{on the main}} road from Kabul to Kandahar. The site consisted of an entire ancient town, numerous Buddhist <b>stupas</b> and caves <b>decorated</b> with elaborate stucco figures dated to the second century C.E. Looters and pillagers have systematically destroyed the site in addition to some illegal, clandestine excavations. Those statues that were too large to remove were smashed, and the small statues were taken to Pakistani bazaars to be sold. Remains above the plateau, where the site is situated, are Buddhist temple sites including Tapa-Kalan, Tapa-i-Kafariha, Bagh-gai, Chakhil-i-Gundi, deh-Ghundi and Gar-Nao.|$|R
50|$|Tabo Monastery (Tabo 'Chos-hKhor' or Doctrinal Enclave) now {{has nine}} temples, four <b>decorated</b> <b>stupas,</b> and cave shrines. The {{paintings}} {{date to the}} 10th-11th centuries for main temple (Tsug la Khang), 13th-14th centuries for the stupas, and from the 15th to the 20th centuries {{for all the other}} temples. Yeshe-Ö and his two sons when they built the monastery in 996 AD blended the provincial and regional characteristics with that of India and Central Asia. One particular feature mentioned in this regard is the iconographic themes of non-Buddhist traditions emanating from the protectress deity Wi-nyu-myin. The main temple is conjectured to represent the entire Vajradhatu Mandala.The monastery has a huge collection of manuscripts and Pramana texts, which were filmed between 1991 and 1998.|$|R
50|$|Also, various Buddhist structures, {{such as the}} Butkara Stupa in {{the area}} of Swat were {{enlarged}} and decorated with Hellenistic architectural elements in the 2nd century BCE, especially during the rule of Menander. Stupas were just round mounds when the Indo-Greeks settled in India, possibly with some top decorations, but soon they added various structural and decorative elements, such as reinforcement belts, niches, architectural decorations such as plinthes, toruses and cavettos, plaster painted with decorative scrolls. The niches were probably designed to place statues or friezes, an indication of early Buddhist descriptive art {{during the time of the}} Indo-Greeks. Coins of Menander were found within these constructions dating them to around 150 BCE. By the end of Indo-Greek rule and during the Indo-Scythian period (1st century BCE), <b>stupas</b> were highly <b>decorated</b> with colonnated flights of stairs and Hellenistic scrolls of Acanthus leaves.|$|R
50|$|The temple {{complex of}} Candi Muara Takus is {{surrounded}} by a 1 metre tall stone perimeter wall that measures 74 x 74 metres. The outer wall is penetrated by a gateway on the northern side. Within the walls are the remains of four substantial Buddhist temples (candi).The most unusual of these is Candi Mahligai. This lotus-shaped Buddhist stupa is unique in Indonesia though there are numerous similar ancient structures in Thailand and Myanmar. This structure is founded on an octagonal base and reaches a height of 14.30 metres. The uppermost level of the <b>stupa</b> is <b>decorated</b> with lion figures that are barely discernible from below.On the east side of Candi Mahligai is the base of Candi Palangka. It is constructed from red stone and now only reaches a height of 1.45 metres. It was reportedly much taller {{at the time of the}} earliest colonial expeditions to the site but the upper terraces have long since collapsed.A third structure within the complex is Candi Bungsu. The most striking thing about this temple is that it was built from two very different kinds of stone. One part is built from red stone and the other section from sandstone. This temple now reaches a height of 6.20 metres.The largest structure at Candi Muara Takus is Candi Tua. Its base measures 32.80 metres x 21.80 metres and it reaches a height of 8.50 metres. This temple is terraced and it bears some resemblance in its design to the much larger stupa, Candi Borobodur, in Java. Like all the temples at Candi Muara Takus, Candi Tua features only minimal decoration. The most notable decorative feature are the seated lion figures on the upper terraces.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Somdet Chuang {{took the}} {{initiative}} to start building a huge stupa at the temple, named [...] "Maharatchamongkhon" [...] (...) [...] The name means 'a blessed, great land', and refers to Thailand under {{the reign of the}} Royal Family, to which the stupa has been dedicated. It also refers to Somdet Chuang's honorary name. The [...] high stupa has a twelve-sided polygon shape with five floors in it, including another glass stupa, a room with relics, Buddha images and images of respected monks, including that of Luang Pu Sodh. The structure also contains a meditation hall, a museum, a parking lot, and a lift. The design is partly based on the shape of Luang Pu Sodh's well-known amulets, and partly on the stupa of Wat Lok Moli in Chiangmai, showing both Rattanakosin and Lanna style influences. Within the top of the Maharatchamongkhon stupa, Pali phrases have been carved into gold, praising mindfulness, moderation, and the upholding of the five precepts. Moreover, the halls within the <b>stupa</b> have been <b>decorated</b> with paintings depicting Buddhist cosmology, based on the legend of Phra Malai and the ancient text Traibhumikatha. The life of Luang Pu Sodh and that of Somdet Chuang are also depicted. The stupa was finished in 2012, costing a total of 500 million baht. It was officially opened by then Princess Srirasmi. After the stupa was finished, Wat Paknam has become a popular attraction for international tourists.|$|R
