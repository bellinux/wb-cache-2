5|$|In the Bahamas, {{insurers}} and reinsurers estimated industry insured losses at about $300million (2004 dollars). All cool-season vegetable plantings, {{and the entire}} banana crop, were lost during Frances. The pineapple crop was significantly impacted by wind damage in Eleuthera, while the entire <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> was lost for similar reasons. The corn crop in Long Island and Cat Island was completely lost. Significant poultry losses were experienced.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} destroyed about 15sq. mi (39 km2) of <b>fruit</b> <b>crop.</b> A {{total of}} 18 {{people were injured}} during the storm. The storm destroyed 3,107 acres of mango trees and 5,662 acres of bananas were destroyed, with the worst crop damage occurring in Jalisco. Moreover, 540 acres of cocoa, 580 acres of papaya, and at least 382 acres of lemon trees were also destroyed by Eugene. Due {{to a combination of}} Eugene and Hurricane Greg, the region registered rainfall amounts for times the average. In addition, three people were killed; two of the deaths occurred in Michoacán. One man died in Venustiano Carrazano when a palm tree was blown over. Another man perished in Manzanillo when he was struck by a fallen palm tree. Over 5,000people were left homeless (mostly from poor and rural areas), including 60people in Manzanillo. Total crop damage amounted to $142million (1987USD); <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> damage alone amounted to more than $2.6million (1987USD). Damage to eight beach houses totaled to $120,000.|$|E
5|$|White pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola) needs two {{alternate}} hosts {{to complete}} its lifecycle. One host is {{plants in the}} genus Ribes. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust.|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{analyze the}} Ukrainian {{names of the}} <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> which {{varieties}} are undergoing scientific and technical examination. Results. Names of <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> form a separate terminological system based on one-word fruit plant names. Names of new introduced <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> usually are borrowed from the language of that country where the crop has extended and whence it has spread, or {{on the basis of}} a Latin generic name. Conclusions. The registered varieties of fruit plants in Ukraine belong to 48 crops. Formation of names of <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> has begun in ancient times and is continuing until now. Crop names, as a rule, consist of one word; two-word names occur as an exception, if so, an adjective should be places ahead of a noun. Names of <b>fruit</b> <b>crops</b> and the name of botanic taxa are specific, belong to different terminological systems and perform different functions...|$|R

The peak rainfall {{in each state}} was [...] in Big Meadows, Virginia, [...] in Emmitsburg, Maryland, [...] in two locations in West Virginia, and [...] in Wilmington, Delaware. The rainfall caused flooding across the region, which washed out the tracks of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad near Baltimore after a stream rose above its banks. In Ellicott City, Maryland, the rains flooded several houses, forcing families to evacuate. In addition, Able maintained stronger winds in the region, producing a gust of [...] at Washington National Airport. The winds downed trees and power lines, which disrupted power and telephone service. The storm also spawned a damaging F2 tornado in Franconia, Virginia, which was potentially the same as another tornado in Potomac, Maryland. The former tornado destroyed one house and the roofs of two others, and also flung a car [...] Damage in the area was estimated at around [...] Further northeast, rainfall reached over 6in (150mm) in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, resulting in localized flooding and damage to the <b>fruit</b> <b>crop.</b> One indirect death was reported in Pennsylvania.

2500|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} persimmon fruit needs frost to ripen and soften, called bletting. Some, such as the early-ripening varieties [...] "pieper" [...] and [...] "NC21"(also known as [...] "supersweet"), easily lose astringency and become completely free of it when slightly soft at the touch—these are then very sweet, even in the British climate. On the other hand, some varieties (like the very large fruited [...] "yates", which is a late ripening variety) remain astringent even when the fruit has become completely soft (at least in the British climate). Frost, however, destroys the cells within the fruit, causing it to rot instead of ripen. Only completely ripe and soft fruit can stand some frost; it will then dry and become even sweeter (hence the misconception). The {{same goes for the}} Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki), where early frost can severely damage a <b>fruit</b> <b>crop.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{broadcast}} in 1991 of the 60 Minutes episode {{on the so-called}} [...] "French Paradox", American consumption of red wine dramatically increased. The grape variety Merlot, in particular, proved to be very popular among consumers. The Washington Wine Commission made the marketing of the state's Merlot a focus, putting Washington in prime position {{to capitalize on the}} new [...] "Merlot craze". Plantings of the varietal increased more than fivefold and Washington Merlots were featured prominently on restaurant wine lists across the country. From there producers went on to experiment with success on varieties and blends as the Washington Wine industry steadily grew. By the beginning of the 21st century, the wine industry was generating more than 2.4 billion dollars annually for the state with wine grape being the fourth most important <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> in the state—behind apples, pears and cherries.

6000|$|Near by, Miss Allan {{was reading}} her letters too. They were not {{altogether}} pleasant, {{as could be}} seen from the slight rigidity which came over her large fine face as she finished reading them and replaced them neatly in their envelopes. The lines of care and responsibility on her face made her resemble an elderly man rather than a woman. The letters brought her news of the failure of last year's <b>fruit</b> <b>crop</b> in New Zealand, which was a serious matter, for Hubert, her only brother, made his living on a fruit farm, and if it failed again, of course, he would throw up his place, come back to England, and what were they to do with him this time? The journey out here, which meant the loss of a term's work, became an extravagance and not the just and wonderful holiday due to her after fifteen years of punctual lecturing and correcting essays upon English literature. Emily, her sister, who was a teacher also, wrote: [...] "We ought to be prepared, though I have no doubt Hubert will be more reasonable this time." [...] And then went on in her sensible way to say that she was enjoying a very jolly time in the Lakes. [...] "They are looking exceedingly pretty just now. I have seldom seen the trees so forward at this time of year. We have taken our lunch out several days. Old Alice is as young as ever, and asks after every one affectionately.
