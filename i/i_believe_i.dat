500|$|In May 2006, Megadeth {{announced}} that its eleventh studio album, United Abominations, was near completion. Originally {{scheduled for release}} in October, Mustaine said that the band was [...] "putting {{the finishing touches on}} it" [...] and postponed its release to May of the following year. He commented on the release: [...] "Metal needs a really good old-school record again. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> have delivered." [...] United Abominations was the band's first album to feature Glen Drover, Shawn Drover, and James Lomenzo. It also has a newer version of [...] "À Tout le Monde" [...] entitled [...] "À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)". The 2007 version is a duet with Cristina Scabbia of Lacuna Coil; it was recorded at a slightly faster tempo than the original and contains an extended solo.|$|E
500|$|During the evening, Elliot and Smith {{discussed}} {{destroying the}} three junks and deploying men {{to attack the}} battery the next day, but Smith acceded to Elliot's recommendation not to do so. Elliot stated that an attack would destroy the village and cause [...] "great injury and irritation" [...] to the inhabitants. In a letter to trader James Matheson on 5 September, Elliot felt {{that it would be}} unbecoming of a British warship to shoot to death the Chinese junks, which his [...] "poor Cutter" [...] could do under their batteries. He wrote: [...] "Perhaps I ought not to have fired at all but every man's patience has limits and mine has been sorely tried. I am afraid I have disappointed the men's ardent spirits here but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> have done well to refrain." [...] He circulated a paper on shore the same day which stated: ...|$|E
500|$|In 1996, actress Lili Taylor played Solanas in {{the film}} I Shot Andy Warhol, which focused on Solanas's {{assassination}} attempt on Warhol (played by Jared Harris). Taylor won Special Recognition for Outstanding Performance at the Sundance Film Festival for her role. The film's director, Mary Harron, requested permission to use songs by The Velvet Underground, but was denied by Lou Reed, who feared that Solanas would be glorified {{in the film}}. Six years before the film's release, Reed and John Cale included a song about Solanas, [...] "I Believe", on their concept album about Warhol, Songs for Drella (1990). In [...] "I Believe", Reed sings, [...] "I believe life's serious enough for retribution... I believe being sick is no excuse. And <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> would've pulled the switch on her myself." [...] Reed believed Solanas was to blame for Warhol's death from a gallbladder infection 20 years after she shot him.|$|E

500|$|Of the six singles {{released}} for the episode, five debuted on US and Canadian top 100 charts.

The chart order was different on the Billboard Canadian Hot 100, where [...] "(What Doesn't Kill You) Stronger" [...] had the highest debut at number fifty-one, [...] "Fly / <b>I</b> <b>Believe</b> <b>I</b> Can Fly" [...] debuted at number fifty-nine, [...] "Here's to Us" [...] at number sixty-four, [...] "Cough Syrup" [...] at number sixty-seven and [...] "Glad You Came" [...] at number seventy-four.|$|E
500|$|Stockhausen, {{along with}} John Cage, {{is one of}} the few avant-garde composers to have succeeded in {{penetrating}} the popular consciousness ( [...] ; [...] ). The Beatles included his face on the cover of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band [...] This reflects his influence on the band's own avant-garde experiments as well as the general fame and notoriety he had achieved by that time (1967). In particular, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] (1967) and [...] "Revolution 9" [...] (1968) were influenced by Stockhausen's electronic music ( [...] ; [...] ). Stockhausen's name, and the perceived strangeness and supposed unlistenability of his music, was even a punchline in cartoons, as documented on a page on the official Stockhausen web site (...) [...] Perhaps the most caustic remark about Stockhausen was attributed to Sir Thomas Beecham. Asked [...] "Have you heard any Stockhausen?", he is alleged to have replied, [...] "No, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> have trodden in some" [...] ( [...] , annotated on 366: [...] "Apocryphal; source unknown").|$|E
500|$|In March 2010, Nesbitt {{accepted}} the ceremonial position of Chancellor of the University of Ulster, succeeding former Lord Mayor of London Sir Richard Nichols. Gerry Mallon, then-chair {{of the university}} ruling council, expected Nesbitt to [...] "bring considerable energy, dynamism and commitment" [...] to the post. Following his official installation on 8 June 2010, Nesbitt said, [...] "Rather than being just an informal role officiating at ceremonies, I think I can act as an ambassador. I have access to {{an awful lot of}} people and places because of my work. I hope to be a voice that can be heard, not just at the university, but also outside promoting the importance of the funding of education. If that involves me being at Stormont, then I'd be very happy to do that. Clearly these public spending cuts are going to have an impact and it's important to fight for funding because it's about investing in students and investing in the future of Northern Ireland. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> can bring something to that, otherwise I wouldn't have taken this on." ...|$|E

500|$|Bure {{was set to}} {{represent}} the Soviet Union at the 1991 Canada Cup, however after turning down a three-year contract with his Russian club, CSKA Moscow, he was left off the final roster. Further controversy ensued five years later in the inaugural 1996 World Cup (the successor tournament to the Canada Cup). Bure had recently recovered from reconstructive surgery to his right knee, and had begun practicing with the Russian national team, when he refused to sign a petition organized by national team veteran Viecheslav Fetisov. With the Russian Ice Hockey Federation dealing with internal corruption, the petition called for the ouster of a few select Russian ice hockey officials. In response, Bure explained, [...] "I do not sign petitions. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> should work – play hockey. Petitions to the federation or to Olympic committees do not interest me." [...] Bure played in the preliminary tournament games, reunited on a line with Fedorov and Mogilny. Considered [...] "perhaps the best forward line on earth" [...] at the time, {{it was the only}} time the three played together at the senior level. Bure bruised a kidney in one of the preliminary games, forcing him out of the main tournament.|$|E
500|$|Nelson's {{body was}} placed in a cask of brandy mixed with camphor and myrrh, which was then lashed to the Victory's {{mainmast}} and placed under guard. Victory was towed to Gibraltar after the battle, and on arrival the body was transferred to a lead-lined coffin filled with spirits of wine. Collingwood's dispatches about the battle were carried to England aboard , and when the news arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news of Nelson's death to Emma Hamilton. She later recalled, They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. [...] "Show him in directly", I said. He came in, and with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, [...] "We have gained a great Victory." [...] – [...] "Never mind your Victory", I said. [...] "My letters – give me my letters" [...] – Captain Whitby was unable to speak – tears in his eyes and a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> gave a scream and fell back, and for ten hours I could neither speak nor shed a tear.|$|E
500|$|Feldman has {{admitted}} in several interviews {{that he has}} been the victim of people who email him to explain psychiatric symptoms, only to divulge eventually that they created it all to fool a doctor. For prolonged cases, he states the impetus for such behavior is the [...] "longing for nurturing, sympathy, care and concern that they feel unable to get in appropriate ways," [...] and that the admiration of forum members is a strong motivator to continue. As manipulation is integral to most cases, the need to control others to feel as if the perpetrator is in control {{of his or her own}} life is apparent, as is the pre-existence of underlying personality disorders. Many people who present factitious disorders crave sympathy and support because it was notably absent in childhood. In a story published in The Village Voice in 2001, a woman recovering from factitious disorder remembered her drive to create conditions that did not exist: [...] "When I'd do something to attract the paramedics and police, I got an adrenaline rush. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> got addicted to it. At the time, it didn't occur to me I was hurting anyone but myself." [...] A psychologist who was a member of the support group for premature infants stated in The New York Times article, [...] "People who do this need something. I wonder if it's a metaphor for some other loss she experienced and is playing over and over again in different shapes." ...|$|E

500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> know more of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E
500|$|On tagging {{first base}} after Cabrera's relay, Galarraga began celebrating his accomplishment. His {{immediate}} reaction to Joyce's on-field ruling was a momentary pause {{followed by a}} wry smile at the umpire {{before returning to the}} mound. Galarraga told reporters after the game that the outing [...] "was my best game, so far", and said that Joyce [...] "probably feels more bad than me. Nobody's perfect. Everybody's human. I understand. I give the guy {{a lot of credit for}} saying, 'I need to talk to you.' You don't see an umpire tell you that after a game. I gave him a hug." [...] He also told reporters, [...] "I know that I pitched a perfect game, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> got it. I said before, I got a perfect game. I'm going to show my son. Maybe it's not in the book, but I'm going to tell my son, 'One time I got a perfect game.' I'll show him the CD," [...] further calling his effort [...] "the first 28-out perfect game". Tigers' manager Jim Leyland added, [...] "It's a crying shame. Jim [...] is a class guy. This sounds crazy, but after looking at the play, nobody is going to feel worse than he does. I yelled a bit after the game because emotions are high. You just want it so bad for the kid. I don't think you're as mad at the umpire as mad the kid didn't get it—and he did deserve it." [...] Leyland also said that Joyce's call was part of the [...] "human element of the game".|$|E
500|$|The episode also {{featured}} {{the first in}} a string of guest appearances by actor Rob Lowe, who had recently departed from the ABC drama series Brothers & Sisters. As a joke, Rob Lowe's credit during the opening credits reads [...] "and introducing Rob Lowe". Unlike Scott, Lowe was originally not expected to join the regular cast, but rather make guest appearances in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] and six third season episodes before departing the show. However, after those episodes were filmed, Lowe later joined the show as a regular cast member. Lowe said he loved playing the part, which he described as [...] "a big fat nerd" [...] and [...] "the most positive person in the world [...] unrelenting enthusiasm", adding, [...] "He is also very, very intense and specific. So whether he's ordering how he would like his water or describing the kind of colors he wants on a graph, everything means the world to him." [...] Throughout the episode, whenever he meets someone new, Chris Traeger points directly at their face and slowly repeats their name. Schur said this habit was the first element the writers conceived for the character. In one line of the episode, while describing his exercise regimen and supplements, [...] "Scientists believe that the first human being who will live 150 years has already been born. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>I</b> am that human being." [...] That line was inspired by Schur's wife, J. J. Philbin, who had recently read an article about that scientific prediction and felt it applied to the character. Parks and Recreation was suffering in the Nielsen ratings when [...] "The Master Plan" [...] aired, and it was hoped Lowe's appearance would help increase viewership. Lowe's performance was heavily publicized in advance of the episode's original broadcast.|$|E
