40|$|To {{what extent}} do countries' {{corporate}} income tax (CIT) rates attract foreign tax bases? What are the revenue implications of a unilateral tax reduction when tax bases are internationally mobile? These questions are explored using a panel of annual data from 17 OECD countries spanning the period 1982 to 2005. We find significant <b>international</b> <b>fiscal</b> externalities {{in the form of}} CIT-induced resource flows. The magnitude, however, indicates that the extent of international corporate tax base mobility is rather modest. Moreover, we find that, on average, a unilateral CIT reduction results in a less-than-proportional increase in the CIT base, thus reducing CIT revenues. The results are robust across a wide range of specifications and point to potential gains from international tax policy coordination. tax competition, corporate income tax base elasticity, instrumental variables, <b>international</b> <b>fiscal</b> externalities, Laffer curve, panel data estimation...|$|R

40|$|Extract] 1997 saw {{the release}} of {{numerous}} detailed reports on the Internet and how transactions taking place over the Internet should be taxed. 1998 was the year of great debate over the effectiveness of existing tax rules and how, if at all, they should be adapted {{to deal with the}} Internet. Within the tax community, the general level of understanding of the Internet and its effect on taxation has grown to the extent that any debate on the topic is increasingly sophisticated. The <b>International</b> <b>Fiscal</b> <b>Association</b> focus and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Ministerial Conference in Ottawa in October 1998 assisted this process. Since then, the tax community has attempted to take the most promising ideas and explore the effect of their implementation on national revenue bases and international trade. This has occurred, for example, at the international level through the OECD working groups and at the domestic level with the US Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce. Ultimately, the result should provide the basis for international consensus on {{the development and implementation of}} principles that satisfy a broad majority of nations...|$|E
