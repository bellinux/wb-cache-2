40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to explore {{hybridization}} influence to achieve the potential of silk yield and quality in commercial tasarculture, as against the current status of applying only a few wild and semi-domesticated ecoraces of Antheraea mylitta D to produce raw silk during commercial crop rearing season (September-December). The four F 1 hybrid combinations generated using Daba, Jata and Raily tasar ecoraces of seed crop rearing season (July-August) were evaluated during commercial crop season of 2007 and 2008 for the influence of hybridization as positive heterosis in the traits of economically important silk productivity and <b>filament</b> <b>denier.</b> The F 1 hybrid, Daba x Jata has recorded positive heterosis in single shell weight (+ 25. 6 %), total silk yield (+ 79. 0 %) and silk filament length (+ 68. 1 %), but for silk filament of high denier (11. 98 d) followed by its reciprocal hybrid, JataxDaba in shell weight (+ 18. 8 %), silk yield (+ 68. 1 %), filament length (+ 63. 8 %) and filament of highest denier (12. 32 d). Though, the RailyxDaba hybrid could show highest heterosis in shell weight (2. 47 g) with filament of least denier (10. 86 d), the improvement in filament length was marginal (+ 44. 7 %) and heterosis in silk yield was negative (- 47. 0 %), while the performance of DabaxRaily hybrid was least among the hybrids. The study infers hybridization influence on silk related traits at F 1 level as positive heterosis and the application feasibility of DabaxJata and JataxDaba hybrids during commercial crop rearing season for higher silk productivity with silk <b>filament</b> <b>denier</b> at least better than one of the parents of F 1 hybrid combination...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Laria is a wild ecorace of {{tropical}} tasar silkworm Antheraea mylitta Drury and the adaptability of this ecorace mainly on Shorea robusta (Sal). It has high economic importance is noteworthy for its small size, robust with variable cocoon colour and has low <b>filament</b> <b>denier.</b> In nature, the voltinism of this ecorace is uni-, bi-, and trivoltine. In the present study, {{variability in the}} cocoon characters and biochemical parameters was assessed to analyze the degree of heterogeneity with in the natural population of Laria {{in relation to the}} cocoon colour. Differential amount in the cocoon traits, such as cocoon weight and shell ratio were recoded with significant variability at p< 0. 05 level. Protein and reducing sugar concentrations were recorded higher in whitish grey cocoons compared to the yellow colored cocoons. This would be highly warranted to study intra-population variability for the understanding of wild tasar silkworm ecoraces like Laria. The study also facilitates to harness the potentialities of Laria ecoraces to apply in breeding prospects. Index Terms- Laria, cocoon color, protein, reducing sugar...|$|E

The {{data of the}} pure races was analysied for the estimation of evaluation index to study the genetic divergence between the races. Where as evaluation index, heterosis and overdominance effects were studied in twelve hybrid combinations. Varied heterotic effects were observed for different traits for hybrid combination. Cocoon weight and shell weight has maximum heterosis over the mid parent in Pure Mysore × Nistari (27 % and 42 % respectively), whereas C 108 × Nistari have shown maximum shell ratio (30 %) among the crosses. The maximum filament length heterosis was obtained from Nistari × Pure Mysore. Heterosis for cocoon weight, shell weight, shell ratio, <b>filament</b> length, <b>denier</b> and renditta based on evaluation index confirmed the above results.

40|$|Diallel {{analysis}} {{was applied to}} evaluate six economically important quantitative traitsnamely cocoon weight, shell weight, shell ratio, <b>filament</b> length, <b>denier</b> and renditta involving two bivoltine races C 108 and NB 4 D 2 and two multivoltine races Nistari and Pure Mysore during 2008 - 09. Analysis of the 12 F 1 p rogeny from the diallel set (4 × 4 diallel) was made following the method of Griffing’s (1956). The gene action, broad and narrow sense heritability was estimated utilizing the method of Hayman (1954). Combining ability analysis revealed that specific combining ability variance was greater in magnitude and {{more important for the}} four out of six quantitative traits, indicating the involvement of non - additive type of gene action for the expression of these traits. The GCA/SCA variance ratio exhibited that cocoon weight, shell weight and filament length was predominantly under the influence of additive genes and other traits are non-additive. The ranking of parents according to the effects of GCA was almost are equal with the ranking of parent according to their mean values. The present results indicate that predicting the GCA values of parents is possible based on their mean values which it is important in silkworm breeding programme. With the use of diallel cross it is observed that all the six cocoon character shad high broad and moderate narrow sense heritability. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{tropical}} climate prevails {{in most of}} the sericultural areas in India, where temperature increases during the summer lead to adverse effects on temperate bivoltine silkworm rearing and cause crop losses. Screening for thermotolerance in the silkworm, Bombyxmori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) is an essential prerequisite for the development of thermotolerant breeds/hybrids. In the current study, the aim was to identify potential bivoltine silkworm strains specific for tolerance to high temperature. The third day of fifth stage silkworm larvae of bivoltine strains were subjected to high temperature of 36 ± 1 ° C with RH of 50 ± 5 % for six hours (10 : 00 - 16 : 00) every day until spinning for three consecutive generations. Highly significant differences were found among all genetic traits of bivoltine silkworm strains in the treated groups. Three groups of silkworm resulted including susceptible, moderately tolerant, and tolerant by utilizing pupation rate or survival rate with thermal stress as the index for thermotolerance.

30|$|Several {{researchers}} {{have attempted to}} study the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort characteristics of woven and knitted fabrics. Varshney et al. (2010) studied the effect of fibre linear density on physiological properties of polyester woven fabrics and observed an increase in thermal resistance, trans planar wicking, air and water vapour permeability with fibre decitex. However they observed that thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and spreading speed of water drop decreased with increase in fibre coarseness. Das et al. (2008) reported reduction in air and water vapour permeability through the fabrics but increased wicking properties with the decrease in fibre diameter in their studies on micro-denier and normal <b>denier</b> <b>filament</b> fabrics. Ramakrishnan et al. (2009) compared the comfort properties of micro denier and normal denier viscose yarn knitted fabrics and observed better water absorbency and wicking for micro denier yarn knitted fabrics. Raj and Sreenivasan (2009) reported that the cotton fibre fineness had negative correlation with air permeability of fabrics woven from yarns having the same count and twist and suggested this outcome of reduced air spaces in the fabrics made from finer fibres. Oglakcioglu and Marmarali (2010) studied the effect of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of cotton knitted fabrics and observed that fabrics knitted with double plied yarn had higher thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity and thermal resistance compared to single plied yarn fabrics. Singh and Nigam (2013) compared carded, combed and compact spun yarn woven fabrics for their comfort performance and reported that compact weft yarn fabrics showed high water vapour permeability while carded yarn fabrics showed higher thermal insulation. Ozdil et al. (2007) studied the thermal comfort properties of carded and combed yarn rib knitted fabrics and observed an increase in thermal conductivity and water vapour permeability of fabrics knitted with combed yarns. Nasrin and Nahida (2011) reported that combed yarns were stronger, less hairy and more uniform than carded yarns. Erdumlu and Saricam (2013) studied the wicking and drying properties of vortex spun yarns and knitted fabrics in comparison with ring-spun yarns and fabrics. They observed that vortex spun yarn had lower yarn and fabric wicking values and water absorbency rate than ring-spun yarns. Tyagi et al. (2009) studied the influence of yarn type on thermal comfort properties of woven fabrics and concluded that Murata Jet Spinning (MJS) yarn fabrics showed higher absorbency, air and water vapour permeability but lower wick ability compared to ring yarn fabrics. The review of published literature suggests that researches are mainly focused on studying the effect of fibre and yarn parameters on comfort properties of woven and knitted fabrics. However, studies on the thermo-physiological properties of plated knits are very limited although the structures are fast becoming preferred choice as intimate wear owing to flexibility in engineering fabrics with different fibre and yarn combinations in the two distinct layers. Moreover, none of the reported studies suggest the desirable fibre and yarn combination in the two layers to engineer fabrics suited for particular environmental conditions. The present study was, therefore undertaken to explore the field further and {{to determine the effect}} of inner layer fibre linear density and the outer layer yarn type on thermo-physiological properties of plated knits.|$|R
