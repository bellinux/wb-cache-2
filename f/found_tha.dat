To account for this effect we calculated the correction to the fluctuation conductivity due to the defects using a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach, with the defects modeled as cylindrical regions with suppressed Tc.

For fields close to Hc 2 and parallel to the columnar, defects we obtained the correction exactly within the lowest Landau level approximation (LLL).

'Verbal nouns' play {{a crucial}} role in the verbal system, being used in periphrastic verbal constructions preceded by a {{preposition}} where they act as the sense verb, and a stative verb conveys tense, aspect and mood information, in a pattern that is familiar from other Indo-European languages. Verbal nouns are true nouns in morphology and inherent properties, having gender, case and their occurrence in what are prepositional phrases, and in which non-verbal nouns are also found. Verbal nouns carry verbal semantic and syntactic force in such core verbal constructions as a result of their meaning content, as do other nouns found in such constructions, such as tha e 'na thosd [...] "he is quiet, he stays silent", literally [...] "he is in his silence", which mirrors the stative usage <b>found</b> in <b>tha</b> e 'na shuidhe [...] "he is sitting, he sits", literally [...] "he is in his sitting".

40|$|Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) is the {{new policy}} and program context in the {{developing}} world within which land administration (LA) is now being discussed. There seem to be good reasons for doing so. Most people who are designated as poor in these countries live off the land. However, the land from which they earn their livelihood is beset by a variety of problems (degradation, fragmentation, etc). Also, the poor land owners/users are helplessly witnessing the deterioriation of the cherished asset reportedly because of tenure insecurity, poverty, and other reasons. The net impact is more destitution and perhaps starvation. Therefore, for LA to be relevant, it has to tally with poverty reduction, help reverse this trend and thereby assist the poor improve their lot. Like most countries {{in the developing world}}, this characterization of LA and poverty somehow explains the situation in Ethiopia. Analysing policy statements set out in the country’s Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program (SDPRP) and other documents, this paper attempts to make a short to mid term prognosis of tenure insecurity and LA. To complement this, the situation of land users and their land is briefly analysed based on primary data obtained from a field survey.

The aim {{of this study was to}} analyse the influence of the surgical approach on the direction of the dislocation in patients treated by a hemiarthroplasty (HA) or total hip arthroplasty (THA) after a femoral neck fracture. Fracture patients have a high risk for dislocations, and this issue has not been previously studied in a selected group of patients with a femoral neck fracture. We analysed the radiographs of the primary dislocation in 74 patients who had sustained a dislocation of their HA (n[*]=[*] 42) or THA (n[*]=[*] 32). In 42 patients an anterolateral (AL) surgical approach was used and in 32 a posterolateral (PL).

For THA patients there was a correlation between the mean angle of anteversion of the acetabular component and the direction of dislocation when comparing patients with anterior and posterior dislocations (p[*]=[*] 0. 027). These results suggest that the surgical approach of a HA has an influence on the direction of dislocation, in contrast to THA where the position of the acetabular component seems to be of importance for the direction of dislocation in patients with femoral neck fractures...|$|R
