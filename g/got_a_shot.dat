25|$|Following a long {{international}} break, Lyon faced Lorient at home, {{their first}} and only back-to-back home league match set. In the match, which was fairly even looking at the statistics, Lyon controlled possession for 57 percent of the match, but did not score a goal until the 72nd following a perfect cross from Sidney Govou into the box, which landed {{at the head of}} Michel Bastos and then {{into the back of the}} net. Lyon maintained the 1–0 lead to win the match moving the club into a tie for second place with title rivals Bordeaux. The following week, Lyon faced rivals Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in a match that saw a Lyon side missing several key players. In the 29th minute, the Parisians got a well-deserved goal from former Lyon player Ludovic Giuly. Despite the home side maintaining their attack well into the second half, their first half goal was canceled out following an Aly Cissokho cross into the box that saw Bafétimbi Gomis get a slight touch on the ball to get it past Grégory Coupet. The goal secured a point for Lyon and also allowed the club to maintain their top 2 position in the table. Lyon contested up-and-comers Toulouse the following match day. Lyon defense was again the first to concede allowing a goal from youngster Moussa Sissoko in just the eighth minute. Despite conceding early, however, Lyon's attack was extremely uptempo, which allowed the away side to break into numerous counterattacks. Lyon's attack finally paid off, in the 52nd minute following a goal from Yannis Tafer, which was his first professional goal. Tafer, who came on as a half-time substitute, secured the goal following a cross into the box by the dangerous Cissokho. The French youth international ran near post and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> off high into the visiting net. With Lyon's confidence high, their attack increased, which led to numerous chances. Eventually, Lyon got a goal from Gomis, his second in two matches to give the club a 2–1 victory. The following week, Lyon reached top of the table for the first time this season, courtesy of a 2–0 win over Lens. Despite enduring a hostile crowd and constant pressure from Lens, Lyon and their defense stood tall with Govou and Kim Källström getting both goals in the seventh and 78th minute, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Director Terry Gilliam would {{praise the}} film as [...] "a work of genius. It got people to {{understand}} what toys are about. They're true to their own character. And that's just brilliant. It's <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> that's always stuck with me, when Buzz Lightyear discovers he's a toy. He's sitting on this landing {{at the top of}} the staircase and the camera pulls back and he's this tiny little figure. He was this guy with a massive ego two seconds before... and it's stunning. I'd put that as one of my top ten films, period." ...|$|E

Johnson, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twenty-fifth, while Harvick was scored in twenty-seventh. The two drivers who failed to qualify for the race were Jeff Green and Johnny Sauter. Once qualifying concluded Keselowski said, [...] "I felt I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at the pole before I qualified but you never really know.

2500|$|... 3LK {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{recognized}} stables in TNA, and at some points has been its most powerful stable. Killings and James <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at the NWA World Tag Team Championship by winning a four-team/eight-man Gauntlet Match on November 12. [...] On November 19 they faced Simon and Swinger, the team of Simon Diamond and Johnny Swinger. The match ended with the titles held up after Killings and Swinger double-pinned each other. On November 26, the entire 3LK would face Diamond, Swinger and Glenn Gilberti in a six-man tag team match for the titles. 3LK ultimately won the match thanks to revenge interference by America's Most Wanted, and became the first team to win the Tag Team titles in a six-man tag team match. 3LK would defend the titles using the Freebird Rule, just as Triple X did earlier in the year.

2500|$|A review from Alan Bisbort {{printed in}} The Daily Tar Heel had a {{headline}} that deemed the album [...] "cosmic hokum". Bisbort wrote about his criticisms of its concept {{and the idea}} of the group, [...] "who went East, <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> of knowledge, came back West, had lots of money at their disposal ... and decided to cut an album guaranteed to give shortcut answers to the question for the multitude". He did not dismiss the album entirely, and recognised the group's musical talents. Tom Von Malder, for The Daily Herald, thought Yes [...] "seldom disappoints", but named Tales an exception, with [...] "Ritual" [...] being the only track that lives up to the strong material on Close to the Edge and Yessongs as it is the [...] "most cohesive, most lyrical of all". He thought the remaining three sides have some good music, but are too scattered, and claimed the album's concept is [...] "a bit too obtuse for a rock album". Holly Spence, in the Lincoln Evening Journal, called Tales a unique and creative album that displays an [...] "inventive combination of sounds and rhythms" [...] that is more interesting than the [...] "dull repetitive noise" [...] that she thought was typical of rock music at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after, Venis {{underwent}} a complete change in persona {{and became a}} member of the Right to Censor (RTC) stable. Venis joined RTC after being abducted by Bull Buchanan and The Goodfather. He became a censorship-based character, directly contrasting with his previously [...] on-screen character. [...] Of this change, Morley said in an interview that [...] "the porn star gimmick and storylines kind of overshadowed my work," [...] and that he wanted a more serious persona to better highlight his in-ring abilities and move towards being one of the WWF's top heels. [...] Right To Censor feuded with the Acolytes and the Dudley Boyz, culminating in an eight-man tag team match at Unforgiven 2000, which RTC won. On the October 12 episode of Smackdown, Venis <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>shot</b> at the WWE Championship against The Rock but failed to win the title. At No Mercy, Venis teamed up with Steven Richards to face Chyna and Mr. Ass. After interference from Eddie Guerrero, RTC picked up the win. On the November 6 episode of Raw, Venis faced The Undertaker in a losing effort. On the November 23 episode of Smackdown, Venis defeated K-Kwik. Venis started a feud with Chyna, culminating in a match at Armageddon which Venis won. At the Royal Rumble, Venis competed in the Royal Rumble match where he was eliminated by The Undertaker.|$|E
