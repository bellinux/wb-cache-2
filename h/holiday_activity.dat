40|$|This thesis investigates British holidaymakers' motivations, {{behaviours}} {{and experiences}} visiting Alanya, Turkey, {{based on the}} analysis of quantitative and qualitative data gathered through structured self-administrated questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. Employing {{a convenience sample of}} 505 holidaymakers visiting a coastal holiday resort in the Mediterranean, the thesis provides a destination-based analysis of the tourist experience process in three analytical phases. Utilising qualitative and quantitative techniques, the study investigates and addresses, in particular, two specific issues: Motivators, constraints and facilitators of holiday choice; and evaluation of holiday/destination behaviour and experiences. The underlying characteristic of Alanya holiday was found to be seeking 'fun in the sun'. ‗Being away‘ was more important than ‗being there‘ as long as sunny weather and the 'right price‘ were guaranteed. Coastal pleasures dominated the <b>holiday</b> <b>activity,</b> and social and cultural contacts were also significant. Motivations, constraints and facilitators were significant determinants of holiday choice and <b>holiday</b> <b>activity</b> patterns. Supporting consumption experiences were the facilitators of peak experiences. Both peak and supporting consumption experiences were crucial in combination for holidaymakers‘ satisfaction. Preferences and perceptions indicated both similarities and differences between holidaymakers. Differences that are rather more significant were based on repeat visitation patterns. Socio-demographic characteristics were more significant for pre-and on-site experience phases. Trip characteristics were more significant for on-site- and post-experience phases. This study adds substantially to our understanding of tourist motivations, behaviours and experiences and provides additional evidence in terms of their complexity and heterogeneity. Demonstrating the relevance of peak touristic experiences and supporting consumption experiences, the study highlighted the importance of the constraints/facilitators, on the structural, interpersonal and intrapersonal levels. Using mixed methods research design and studying three phases of the tourist experience process simultaneously, the study provides both a theoretical and a methodological base for future research. The study has important implications for the management and marketing of destination experiences. This study calls for cross-national research involving its replication with random sampling in the same resort area, and other tourist resorts in the Mediterranean...|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Online {{communities}} as a distinctive feature of virtual forums and social networking groups have gradually {{become one of}} the major sources of information, surpassing corporate websites in terms of influence on purchasing decisions. Such platforms are characterized by cosmopolitan brand communities sharing the same field of expertise and are constructed around a series of social relationships based upon common interest in a particular topic, e. g. golf tourism. Golf is an interesting tourist segment for Apulia as well as a widespread <b>holiday</b> <b>activity,</b> which implies the adoption of English as a Lingua Franca (ELF). It is used in exclusive clubs and resorts and for the profound sharing of linguistic codes. By taking part in digital communities, working on online forums or social networks, golfers can ask questions and receive feedback on exclusive tourist destinations, emotions, and experiences, thus generating debates and exchanging ideas. Social issues related to the various topics of discussion including golf are developed through debates, requests for information, questions and answers that can create word-of-mouth promotion. On the latter aspect literature in the digital communication field has so far focused its attention, by investigating virality as an effect of the emotional content of posts, whereas few researches have analyzed the emotional response and the ability to solicit opinions as effects of the linguistic content of the information requests. The purpose of this exploratory study was therefore to provide evidence for the existence of possible relationships between specific linguistic contents – i. e. personal pronouns with their possessive adjectives and modal verbs on the one hand, and emotions raised and the number of responses elicited on the other - within the English version of Yahoo Answers which is dedicated to resorts with golf courses. To this end, two studies were carried out: 1) a qualitative/pragmalinguistic analysis and 2) a quantitative and marketing-related one. Results, albeit limited by the explorative nature of the research, provide useful insights into the extent to which such language expressions can affect emotional responses in respondents and can initiate response processes, with stimulating implications concerning management in general and the management of digital platforms on golf tourism in Apulia...|$|E

40|$|International audienceBased on a {{socio-cultural}} study (Pociello 1981; Bourdieu, 1979) {{carried out}} through questionnaires (N = 237) {{and added to}} by several semi-structured interviews, this article studies the users of canyoneering natural sites. Partly picking up on the traditional opposition to the social space of sports (Pociello, 1995), the results highlight four ideal types of users: the tourist-customers, the hedonistic participants and the purists; that represents respectively 67 %, 16 % and 8 % of the total of Canyoneering sites visited, and also the guides. The tourist-customers are the beginners who are taught by a guide. For {{the majority of these}} people, it is the first descent (73 %) and less than 13 % of them have already been canyoneering less than five times. For them, canyoneering is a <b>holiday</b> <b>activity</b> (39 %) or a natural sport (40 %) or even, an activity of nature, but the ecological concern is not relatively present. The hedonistic participants are then those who practice canyoneering without an instructor and do 4 to 40 canyons per season in optimal conditions. And the purists are men aged from 35 to 65, who reside in rural areas. Purists, or "impassioned" as they are defined, practise all year round. They account for the greatest number of outings (from 40 to 100 canyons per year). The article discusses in particular the relation between the person and their own body, the influence of the distinguishing mechanism within the activity, and the separation between consumption and participation in canyoneering.

40|$|The {{literature}} {{demonstrates that}} wildlife tourism, which can incorporate anything from insects (dragonflies, butterflies, glow-worms), flowers, mammals and birds, {{has become a}} potentially lucrative activity which is attracting attention from tourists and destinations. There are {{both positive and negative}} impacts associated with wildlife tourism. It can contribute to the conservation of threatened habitats / species, provide economic benefit to local communities attract new types of tourists to remote and economically peripheral areas, and provide environmental education and psychological benefits to tourists. Less desired outcomes of wildlife tourism imply that as places and their wildlife become more popular, tourist numbers and infrastructure increases and so too do incidences of disturbance which directly impact upon the well-being and sustainability of the focal wildlife populations such as the disruption of daily behaviour including feeding, breeding, and resting. Whether the positives outweigh the benefits has yet to be tried or tested and may well depend upon how the resource and visitors are managed which in turn depends upon understanding the expectations, the behaviour and the experiential benefits sought by tourists. Given the spectrum of tourist-wildlife opportunities, it follows that wildlife tourists are by no means an homogenous market, there are significant variations in typologies, from the 'serious' to the 'casual' and from the 'specialist' to the 'generalist'. Therefore planning and management become more difficult as the behaviour and needs of each segment differ enormously. Up until now, the human dimensions of watching wildlife have been rather overlooked in the tourism literature; and particularly the experiential and psychological benefits of wildlife tourism have not been adequately explored or applied to the management and marketing of destinations. Using a sample of British tourists, the aim of this research was, therefore, to explore the culture of wildlife tourism in order to contribute a better understanding {{of what it means to}} enjoy wildlife experiences, the content of what exactly is enjoyed, the process through which people attend to and perceive wildlife and the emotional responses it provokes. Inherent in this thesis is the discussion of the human dimensions of wildlife, namely how wildlife tourists perceive the natural world, whether they have eco, anthropocentric or anthropomorphic views of the animal kingdom, and whether the application of biophilia, our supposed inherent desire to connect with other, non-human, living things, can be applied to wildlife tourism. In addition the author explored the field skills involved in wildlife watching with regards to identification and photography, what constitutes a memorable experience, and finally the expectations and benefits of travelling on an organised wildlife holiday. In order to satisfy this aim, an ethnographic approach to data generation was employed in two distinct stages. First in-depth interviews were carried out with British tour operators to investigate the business of wildlife tour operating, to discover who the main operators are, the types of products that they offer, the profile of the clients that they attract as well as the management and delivery of their tours. This showed that the wildlife tourism market can be divided into different typologies, for example, birders, `listers' and general naturalists. Secondly, the author joined two tour groups within the general naturalist market, one birdwatching tour to Andalucia to watch the Autumn migration and one whale and bird-watching tour on the Sea of Cortez, Baja California. Whilst on tour, field journals were kept to record the days' events, participants emotional responses to wildlife, and her own observations of tour leading. These journals were coupled with in-depth interviews of tour participants whilst on tour and later in-depth interviews with people who regularly take dedicated wildlife holidays. This ethnographic study of these dedicated general naturalists reveals a number of important themes which may be of use for future studies such as: how interest in wildlife began, how wildlife watching is part of everyday life not just a <b>holiday</b> <b>activity,</b> the fascination with how wildlife adapts to human / urban environments and the relationship with regular wildlife visitors in their garden. In addition it highlights how wildlife tourism is used as a symbol of self presentation, how it is important to develop skills such as identification of species and photography, and how spontaneity, close proximity to wildlife, high numbers and first sightings all make for memorable experiences. There are a number of profound and psychological benefits which the nature of this study allowed to come to the fore, and that was the wonderment and sense of awe at the beauty and diversity of the natural world, of really feeling alive and in 'flow' when watching wildlife and how being in 'flow' distorts time. Linked to this is the spiritual fulfilment and sustenance provided by nature. The physical attributes of the wildlife holiday highlight the important role of the tour leader, their knowledge of species and of where to see them as well as the demonstration of responsible wildlife watching behaviour. Participants voiced their desire for relaxation, for meeting like-minded people and for sharing experiences with others. Finally participants appeared to be aware of potential negative impacts and liked to see responsible tour operating. The thesis ends by discussing the practical implications of these findings for industry and for wider society, and concludes by suggesting areas for future research. "An honest experience of nature would find that the natural world is an arena of endurance, tragedy and sacrifice as much as joy and uplift. It is about the struggle against the weather, the perils of migration, the ceaseless vigilance against predators, the loss of whole families and the brevity of existence. The natural world is like a theatre, a stage beyond our own, in which the dramas that are an irreducible part of being alive are played out without hatred or envy or hypocrisy. No wonder they tell us so much about ourselves and our own frailties" (Mabey 2006 : 13). "EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Tourism Management), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The goal of {{this study}} is to develop a {{sustainable}} tourism strategy for the Soshanguve Township. The motivation for this study arose out of the acute developmental challenges facing many township communities in South Africa, mainly due to the absence of economic opportunities. This results in a high unemployment rate, poverty and an elevated number of crime incidences. A sustainable community tourism strategy could alleviate this situation by availing itself of the opportunities presented by the booming tourism industry to the Soshanguve township, and other communities with similar characteristics. To this end, a firm conceptual framework was laid through the review of literature on the tourism system and indicators of sustainability, tourism development planning, tourism development in South Africa, and community tourism. Literature on the tourism system was instrumental in conceptualising the components required for tourism development to take root in Soshanguve township, namely the potential demand for Soshanguve tourism (including tourists’ region of origin), the infrastructure and services required for visitors en route to the destination, and the readiness of the local community and tourism industry in Soshanguve for tourism development (products, facilities and services). The concept of sustainability and indicators thereof are explored in order to provide a benchmark for monitoring tourism development in Soshanguve, and to ensure that the gains from tourism are preserved for the future. Literature on tourism development planning provided the necessary organisational dimension needed to avoid chaotic development and any potential negative impacts. Furthermore, an analysis of tourism development in South Africa was instrumental in positioning the Soshanguve tourism development strategy within the national, regional and local government context. Finally, the community tourism development component provided vital input from existing research on community tourism initiatives. The research paradigm was both quantitative and qualitative. Following the exploratory research approach, three surveys were conducted by means of self-administered questionnaires. The aim was to explore the demand side of the Soshanguve tourism product through a survey of potential visitors to the Soshanguve township, as well as the supply side through a survey of residents of Soshanguve (ascertaining perceptions of tourism impacts on their community) and another survey of tourism business managers (to assessing product availability and quality). This process was complemented by a qualitative study by means of interviews with three community leaders to explore in greater detail the unique selling points in Soshanguve, tourism planning issues, and the objectives of tourism development in the community. The following literature sources constituted the pillars of the questionnaires, World Economic Forum, 2008 : 38; Keyser, 2008 : 37; Simpson, 2008 : 1 and Oyola et al., 2012 : 662 - 665. The interview questions were largely drawn from tourism planning literature (Commonwealth of Australia, 2004 : 7; Lee, 2012 : 2; Chi & Dyer, 2010; Nunkoo & Ramkissoo, 2011). The demand side questionnaire was administered to 401 (N) visitors to City of Tshwane between the 23 rd and 27 th of September 2013. These were considered to be potential tourists to Soshanguve because these visitors were in the Pretoria Central Business District which is just about 45 kilometres away from Soshanguve. The second survey (supply side) was administered to 429 (N) residents of the Soshanguve community between 5 th October 2013 and 9 th October 2013. The product managers’ questionnaire was administered to all 29 (N) managers of tourism businesses identified in Soshanguve from 11 th October 2013 to 16 th of October 2013. Finally, interviews with the three community leaders were held between the 28 th of September 2013 and the 10 th of October 2013. The data collected was processed by the Statistical Consultation Services of the North-West University (Potchefstroom campus) using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software programme. The results were analysed using descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, factor correlation analysis, Spearman’s rank correlations, ANOVA tests and t-tests. The results of the descriptive analysis revealed the travel behaviour of the visitors as highly favourable to day visits with most holidays lasting between two and three days. The majority of respondents used hotel accommodation and arrived at the destination by car. The greatest motivation for taking a holiday was to relax, with the most preferred <b>holiday</b> <b>activity</b> being to visit historical places, followed closely by appreciating nature. The most important determinant of the holiday destination choice was finances, with security featuring next. It was also evident that most of the visitors were not familiar with townships around the City of Tshwane as just about half of them had visited a township in the past. The greatest motivation for visiting a township was to experience traditional dance, drama and music. The study further conducted three factor analyses on visitor motivations for taking a holiday, visitor holiday activities, and holiday destination choice determinants. The exploratory factor analysis identified five factors in the travel motivations (socio-cultural motivators, interpersonal motivators, physical motivators, status motivators, and recovery motivators), four factors among the preferred activities (adventure activities, cultural activities, social activities, and outdoor activities), and five factors among the holiday destination choice determinants (familiarity, physical well-being, economic factors, safety and recommendations/references). The factor correlation matrix revealed no significant correlations between them, although there were visible correlations between the socio-cultural motivators for taking a holiday and recovery motivators. The same could be said of adventure activities and cultural activities. The t-test indicated no significant differences between visitors who had previously been to the township and those who had not. Regarding the results of the supply side analysis, the focus was on the residents of Soshanguve, the tourism product managers in the community, and interviews with the community leaders. The descriptive statistics revealed that many residents had a strong attachment to their community as they would not consider living elsewhere. Generally, they have a positive perception of tourism impacts on their community, as most of them agree that tourism development would be beneficial to both the community and themselves. The product managers think business has been good, but the quality of the products is questionable considering that most of the tourism businesses neither belong to an industry association for peer evaluation nor have received any grading. Results of the qualitative study indicated that even though there is a tourism product development plan for Soshanguve at the City of Tshwane tourism office, none of the community leaders interviewed was aware of this. This seems to suggest that the public consultation process was either not followed or was flawed. The interviews also unearthed the rich history, natural environment and cultural heritage of the Soshanguve people. Finally, a factor matrix analysis was performed on the perceptions of the residents on the impacts of tourism development on their community and the general tourism business success factors in Soshanguve. Five impact factors (economic, social, infrastructure, environmental, and recreational) were identified with the factor correlation analysis revealing visible correlations between infrastructure and recreation/entertainment. An ANOVA test was conducted to determine if there are any correlations between the community attachment of respondents and their perceptions of tourism impacts. No significant correlations were found. The exploratory factor matrix analysis on the general tourism industry success factors yielded six factors, namely facilities and services, communication tools, access, visibility, human resources, and safety. The factor correlation analysis indicated no significant correlations between the factors. The key contributions of this study can be noted as follows: * The development of a pioneer sustainable community tourism strategy for Soshanguve, in particular and townships in general; * The proposed inclusive stakeholder consultative approach in the development of sustainable township tourism; * The holistic approach to tourism destination planning that takes into consideration the tourists origin region, conditions in the transit route region and the host destiantion; * Finally, the application of methodological triangulation in township tourism research.
