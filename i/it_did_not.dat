5|$|A. Junaidi, {{writing for}} The Jakarta Post, notes that Gerhana Kembar was well {{received}} by Indonesia's LGBT community as <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> link homosexuality to negative issues like drug use.|$|E
5|$|Among other provisions, it granted {{unmarried}} women and blacks who met property requirements {{the right to}} vote. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> specify an amendment procedure {{and had to be}} replaced entirely in a constitutional convention.|$|E
50|$|It {{exhibits}} only peripheral activity since <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> readily {{cross the}} blood-brain barrier; hence, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> cause drowsiness because <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> readily enter {{the central nervous}} system.|$|R

50|$|When {{we think}} of the Hindu religion, unlike other {{religions}} in the world, the Hindu religion <b>does</b> <b>not</b> claim any one prophet; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> worship any one god; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> subscribe to any one dogma; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> believe in any one philosophic concept; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> follow any one set of religious rites or performances; in fact, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to satisfy the narrow traditional features of any religion or creed. It may broadly be described {{as a way of life}} and nothing more.|$|R
5|$|Despite the storm's {{powerful}} intensity, Hurricane Dean's {{damage was}} moderate. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have severe or lasting effects on infrastructure, and the non-agricultural sectors of economies throughout the Greater Antilles recovered quickly.|$|E
5|$|First, Universal {{knew that}} <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> have {{trademark}} rights to King Kong, yet it proceeded to broadly assert such rights anyway. This {{amounted to a}} wanton and reckless disregard of Nintendo's rights.|$|E

50|$|Due to its {{compatibility}} {{with the older}} operating system, the browser lacks the entire feature set of modern Firefox versions. In particular, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> fully support Core Text, so <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> understand Apple Advanced Typography features in certain international fonts; <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> support graphics acceleration for compositing; and <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> support WebGL (because PowerPC Tiger <b>does</b> <b>not</b> support OpenGL 2). Furthermore, for security and maintainability reasons, NPAPI plugins support is deprecated, and has been subsequently removed.|$|R

5|$|Operation Gisela did {{not achieve}} its {{intended}} outcome. <b>It</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> deliver the mass casualties that Schmid hoped for and <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> disrupt British bombing operations. The very next night, a small-scale repeat-operation was attempted but {{had made no}} impact. The size of the German force {{was less than a}} quarter of what Schmid had originally hoped could be mustered. One source referred to Gisela as the swansong of the German night fighter force. During the course of the operation, the last German aircraft to be brought down over British soil crashed.|$|E

As this brigade had relation to the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> assume its lineage.|$|E

On February 13, El Mundo published the entire letter, in both Spanish and English.|$|E

5|$|Although (reportedly) {{molybdenum}} {{was deliberately}} alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely {{and was later}} lost. In the West in 1754, Bengt Andersson Qvist examined a sample of molybdenite and determined that <b>it</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> contain lead and thus was not galena.|$|E
5|$|Although few strongholds in the {{northeast}} remained unconquered and in Christian hands, the fall of Taormina marked the effective end of Byzantine Sicily, and the consolidation of Muslim control over the island.

50|$|As to recklessness, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> abhor, {{draw back}} from evil because <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> see {{the danger of}} akusala and <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> fear its {{consequences}} such as an unhappy rebirth. The “Paramattha Mañjūsā” compares recklessness to a moth which is attracted to the fire, although this is dangerous for it. Are we enslaved by pleasant experiences? We may even commit evil through body, speech or mind on account of them. Then recklessness <b>does</b> <b>not</b> fear the danger of akusala, <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> care {{about the consequences of}} akusala.|$|R

5|$|Aspirin can induce {{swelling}} of skin tissues in some people. In one study, angioedema appeared one {{to six hours}} after ingesting aspirin {{in some of the}} people.
