40|$|Metallic {{construction}} materials can be strengthened relatively easily and effectively with externally bonded fibre-reinforced polymer (FRP) composites {{and in order}} to understand the bonded interface, researchers have tested FRP-to-metal bonded joints. Despite several different <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> being employed to date, no systematic investigation has yet been conducted on the effect of different configurations. This paper presents the results of a finite element investigation on the interfacial stresses induced in different FRP-to-metal <b>joint</b> test <b>configurations.</b> The distributions of interfacial shear and normal stresses are determined for single-shear and double-shear joints in which either the metal or FRP is loaded and the relative differences and similarities are also established between the joints under investigation. A fictitious FRP-strengthened beam is then modelled and specific <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> which most accurately represent the interfacial stress distributions in the beam at selected locations are identified. The findings of this study will aid researchers in selecting FRP-to-metal <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> most appropriate for representing the interfacial stress states in different FRP-strengthened member scenarios...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDirect thermal laser joining {{of plastic}} and {{metallic}} materials is nowadays arising {{as an alternative}} technology for the generation of hybrid joints. The focus {{of this study is}} on analyzing the mechanical behavior and failure mechanisms of three polymer-metal configurations: lap, T and Arcan <b>joint</b> <b>configurations.</b> The metal was locally structured by pulsed laser radiation producing micro-patterns to improve adhesion of the polymeric part. Two micro-patterns were considered: low and high distance between pattern centers. Secondly, {{the opposite side of the}} micro-structured metal was irradiated by a Continuous Wave (CW) fibre laser to achieve the mechanical interlock between the two materials. The mechanical performance of lap, T and Arcan <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> was assessed by tensile-shear, pull-out and Arcan tests respectively. A comprehensive inspection of the interface was carried out after the mechanical tests. The mechanical performance revealed a meaningful influence of the distance between patterns for the three <b>joint</b> <b>configurations.</b> Furthermore, the Arcan results evidenced a meaningful influence of the angle between the joining plane and the orientation of the applied load.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{obstacle}} avoidance criteria are developed, utilizing the kinematic redundancy of serial redundant manipulators having revolute joints and tracking pre-determined end eVector paths. The first criterion {{is based on}} the instantaneous distances between certain selected points along the mani-pulator, called configuration control points (CCP), and the vertices of the obstacles. The optimized <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> are obtained by maximizing these distances. Thus, the links of the manipulator are configured away from the obstacles. The second criterion uses a diVerent approach, and is based on Voronoi boundaries representing the equidistant paths between two obstacles. The optimized <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> are obtained by minimizing the distances between the CCP and control points selected on the Voronoi boundaries. The validities of the criteria are demonstrated through computer simulations...|$|R

40|$|Little {{attention}} has been paid to joining unidirectionally reinforced high strength natural fibre composites. Therefore the main objective of the paper is to investigate the influence of joint geometry on the strength of joints. Epoxy bonded single lap shear joints (SLJs) between henequen and sisal fibre composite elements have been manufactured and tested to assess the strength of the structural bonds. The joints have been successfully modelled using finite element analysis and experimental measurements have been verified theoretically. A second phase of the research concerned the performance of integrated joints, termed "intermingled fibre joints" (IFJs) and "laminated fibre joints" (LFJs). These joints are manufactured by intimately combining fibre bundles (IFJs) or laminating layers of fibre bundles (LFJs). These <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> possess much higher lap shear strengths than the single lap shear joints and the failure modes of the three <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> are compared...|$|R
5000|$|In some people, the {{sacroiliac}} joints {{reverse the}} normal concave-convex 'locking' relationship, {{which can lead}} to rotational misalignment. [...] The variation in <b>joint</b> <b>configuration</b> results in some sacroiliac joints being inherently weaker or more prone to misalignment. [...] Certain biomechanical or muscle length imbalances may ultimately predispose a person to sacroiliac dysfunction and pain. Likely, this is a result of altered gait patterns and repetitive stress to the SI joint and related structures. These conditions exist in persons with leg-length inequality, scoliosis, a history of polio, poor-quality footwear, and hip osteoarthritis. There is also a notable incidence of lumbar spinal fusion patients that present with sacroiliac pain and hypermobility, potentially due to the adjacent lumbar joints being fixed and unable to move. Clinical studies have found up to 75% of post-lumbar fusion patients develop SI joint degeneration within five years of surgery.|$|E

5000|$|Made {{of solid}} brass, the Svea 123 weighs about 500 grams (19 ounces), {{measures}} 100 mm x 130 mm (3.9” x 5.1”) and will burn {{for over an}} hour on full tank (about 4 ounces) of fuel. Later models (designated the “Svea 123R” and also sold as the Optimus “Climber”) were made with a built-in cleaning needle to keep the burner jet from clogging by pushing soot or other impurities outward; early Sievert models without the self-cleaning needle came with a small wire pricker that is used to clean the burner jet manually by pushing the soot inwards. These older models are distinguishable by their downwardly-angled spindle and control valve, to which the adjusting key is attached. The spindle on a Svea 123R with the self-cleaning needle is at a right angle to the stem. Other differences between older and newer models include the vaporizer on older models, which is smooth, while newer models of both the Svea 123 and the 123R are finned and have a stronger <b>joint</b> <b>configuration</b> at the base. The pressure-relief valve in the filler cap has also been redesigned several times to improve both reliability as well as re-seating of the valve after it has opened.

40|$|Copyright © 2006 SAE International This work compares three {{aluminium}} sheet joining processes {{to determine their}} capability, efficiency and cost for mass production applications in automotive structures and closures. The joining processes investigated are Resistance Spot Welding (RSW), Self-Pierce Riveting (SPR) and Spot Friction Joining (SFJ). Quantitative comparisons have been {{made on the basis}} of tensile strength (shear and peel), process time, equipment price and running cost. RSW is the most commonly employed joining method for steel sheet in the automotive industry. Its principle benefits are high speed and low cost operation, plus the ability to weld a wide range of <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> with the same gun. The main process limitations for aluminium are weld consistency and electrode-life, though recent work has shown that both of these can be largely overcome with regular electrode polishing [1, 2]. SPR is already in use for volume production of aluminium body structures. Its principle benefits are superior mechanical strength and ability to join dissimilar materials. The main process limitations are the ongoing piece cost of the rivets and the limited range of <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> achievable on each gun. End-of-life recycling of aluminium parts is more complex when they contain steel rivets. SFJ is derived from friction stir welding technology, its principle benefit being rapid low cost joining of thin sheet. SFJ can join some of the commonly used automotive alloys and is low in power consumption. The process is presently limited to simple <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> and requires long process times to join thick sheets...|$|R

Focusing on the effect of <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> on dimensional integrity of complex assemblies, the method recursively decomposes a product <b>configuration</b> and assigns <b>joint</b> <b>configurations</b> according to simple rules, in order to achieve a designed dimensional adjustability and non-forced fit. The rules employed during the decomposition process are drawn from the previous works of assembly design. An augmented AND/OR graph is utilized to represent a process of assembly synthesis with the corresponding assembly sequences, and the algorithm for generating the AND/OR graph is discussed. The method is applied to two dimensional skeletons of product designs at very early stage of the design process. The relation of the assembly synthesis to Datum Flow Chain (Mantripragada and Whitney, 1998) is discussed.

However, considering motion synthesis solely in topological spaces is insufficient since it does not cater for additional tasks and constraints in other representations. In this paper we propose methods to combine and exploit different representations for motion synthesis, with specific emphasis on generalization of motion to novel situations. Our approach is formulated in the framework of optimal control as an approximate inference problem, which allows for a direct extension of the graphical model to incorporate multiple representations.
