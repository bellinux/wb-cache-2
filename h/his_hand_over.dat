5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to}} the bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E
5|$|Tallon {{was then}} rested and Saggers {{took his place}} for the next county match against Leicestershire. Saggers scored six, took a catch in each innings and conceded only six byes as Australia won by an innings. Saggers was then rested {{for the next two}} matches, against Yorkshire and Surrey. Australia scraped home by four wickets in the former and won by an innings in the latter. Tallon batted {{steadily}} with 10, 17 not out and 50 not out, but conceded 35 byes while taking two catches. Tallon was having difficulty with the bounce and movement of the ball in English conditions, and sustained a bruised right finger when he lost sight of a Ray Lindwall bouncer on a misty morning during the Surrey match. He was hit after placing <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his face for protection, and the ball ran away for four byes.|$|E
25|$|Still the Saints {{were just}} {{trailing}} 10-3 {{near the end}} of the third quarter, and had a great chance to tie the game when defensive tackle Renaldo Turnbull blocked Butler's 45-yard field goal attempt. New Orleans defensive end Vince Buck recovered the ball and returned it 62 yards for a potential touchdown, only to see the play wiped out by an offsides penalty on teammate Robert Massey, who had lined up with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the neutral zone. The penalty not only eliminated the score, but it also gave Chicago a first down, and seven plays later, Butler kicked a 25-yard field goal to put them up 13-3.|$|E

25|$|Ford usually {{gave his}} actors little {{explicit}} direction, although on occasion he would casually {{walk through a}} scene himself, and actors were expected to note every subtle action or mannerism; if they did not, Ford would make them repeat the scene until they got it right, and he would often berate and belittle those who failed to achieve his desired performance. On The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Ford ran through a scene with Edmond O'Brien and ended by drooping <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> a railing. O'Brien noticed this but deliberately ignored it, placing {{his hand on the}} railing instead; Ford would not explicitly correct him and he reportedly made O'Brien play the scene forty-two times before the actor relented and did it Ford's way.|$|E
25|$|Bittaker and Norris drove Hall to a {{location}} in the San Gabriel Mountains beyond where they had taken Lucinda Schaefer. At this location, she was raped twice by Bittaker and once by Norris. On the second occasion in which Bittaker raped Hall, Norris saw what he believed to be vehicle headlights approaching. Upon informing Bittaker, he (Bittaker) clasped <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> Hall's mouth and dragged her into nearby bushes as Norris drove in an unsuccessful search of the vehicle he had seen. When {{he returned to the}} van, the pair drove to {{a location}} deeper in the San Gabriel Mountains, where Bittaker forced Hall to walk, naked, up a hill alongside the road, then perform fellatio upon him. Bittaker then ordered Andrea Hall to pose for several Polaroid pictures.|$|E
500|$|Behind the king, {{holding his}} hands to his head, is Prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk (21), another {{opponent}} of the Constitution, known for being on a Russian payroll. Below him is another opponent of the Constitution, Antoni Złotnicki (22). An anonymous [...] black-clad French royalist (23) is shown looking terrified at the scene, seeing another revolution in the making. He raises <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the king's head.|$|E

500|$|The Gospel of Matthew relates {{that when}} {{told his mother}} and {{brothers}} were waiting to see him, Jesus replied, [...] "Who is my mother and who are my brothers?" [...] Stretching <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his disciples he said, [...] "Here are {{my mother and my}} brothers! For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother, and my sister, and mother." [...] Pope Benedict XVI stated that this dictum of Jesus brought the fourth commandment to a new and higher level. By doing God's will, any person can become part of the universal family of Jesus. Thus, the fourth commandment's responsibilities extend to the greater society and requires respect for [...] "legitimate social authorities". The Catechism specifies [...] "duties of citizens and nations", which Kreeft summarizes as: ...|$|E
500|$|Apple Records {{released}} [...] "Photograph", {{backed by}} [...] "Down and Out", on 24 September 1973 in America, and on 19 October in Britain. Starr made a promotional film for [...] "Photograph", {{in which he}} mimed to the song while walking through the grounds of Tittenhurst Park, the Berkshire estate that he had recently purchased from former bandmate John Lennon. To circumvent the BBC's ban on lip-synching, Starr placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth {{for part of the}} song, thereby making it impossible to tell whether he was singing or merely miming. The single's picture sleeve consisted of a photo by Barry Feinstein that showed Starr's head poking through a large star made of silver foil. The same image, which author Bruce Spizer terms [...] "the Ringo starfish", appeared on the single's face labels and on those of the Ringo album.|$|E
500|$|To {{decide who}} would become the monarch, six of them decided on a test, with Otanes abstaining, as he had no {{interest}} in being king. They were to gather outside the palace, mounted on their horses at sunrise, and the man whose horse neighed first in recognition of the rising sun would become king. According to Herodotus, Darius had a slave, Oebares, who rubbed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the genitals of a mare that Darius favored. When the six gathered, Oebares placed his hands beside the nostrils of Darius's horse, who became excited at the scent and neighed. This was followed by lightning and thunder, leading the others to dismount and kneel before Darius in recognition of his apparent divine providence. In this account, Darius himself favored that he achieved the throne not through fraud, but cunning, even erecting a statue of himself mounted on his neighing horse with the inscription: [...] "Darius, son of Hystaspes, obtained the sovereignty of Persia by the sagacity of his horse and the ingenious contrivance of Oebares, his groom." ...|$|E

500|$|Gatiss {{wrote in}} the script for the Daleks' {{redesign}} to be [...] "big buggers...bigger than we've seen them before". The eyestalk {{was designed to be}} level with Smith's eyeline. Moffat and Gatiss wanted the new Daleks to be very colourful, similar to the Daleks of films from the 60s. Gatiss originally wanted there to be a green Dalek, but he decided that green [...] "just doesn't seem to work somehow". Nick Briggs, who voiced the Daleks, planned to counter their bright colours with a more vicious voice. Moffat wanted to somehow incorporate [...] "Spitfires in space". A replica of a World War II Spitfire was used in front of a greenscreen to shoot the live action parts of the scene and the image of the Spitfire, {{while the rest of the}} scene was computer-generated. The sequence contained the line [...] "Broadsword to Danny Boy", a reference to a similar line in the film Where Eagles Dare. Gatiss provided the voice of the Spitfire pilot himself, doing one version clean and another with <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his mouth. In an interview in April 2010, Gatiss described how the cameo came about: ...|$|E

2500|$|Lawrence rewrote many of {{his novels}} several times to perfect them and {{similarly}} he returned {{to some of his}} early poems when they were collected in 1928. This was in part to fictionalise them, but also to remove some of the artifice of his first works. As he put in himself: [...] "A young man is afraid of his demon and puts <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the demon's mouth sometimes and speaks for him." [...] His best-known poems are probably those dealing with nature such as those in the collection Birds, Beasts and Flowers, including the Tortoise poems, and [...] "Snake", one of his most frequently anthologised, displays some of his most frequent concerns: those of man's modern distance from nature and subtle hints at religious themes.|$|E
2500|$|On 27 July 1947, a 13-year-old girl {{reported}} to police that a boy called John had assaulted her by putting <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> {{her mouth and}} saying: [...] "What {{would you do if}} I killed you? I have done it before." [...] This incident was not connected to Straffen until later. Six weeks later, Straffen was found to have strangled five chickens belonging to the father of a girl with whom he had quarrelled. When arrested, Straffen was also under suspicion for burglary and in interview cheerfully confessed to it and many other incidents to which he had not been connected. He was remanded in custody, and the Medical Officer of Horfield prison examined him, certifying that he was mentally retarded. On 10 October, Straffen was committed to Hortham Colony in Bristol under the Mental Deficiency Act 1913.|$|E
2500|$|A Royal North-West Mounted Police {{investigation}} {{began after}} word reached Fort Norman that Inuit {{had been seen}} wearing the priests' clothing, {{and the two men}} surrendered themselves without incident in May 1916. Part of Uloqsaq's police statement read, [...] "I wanted to speak; Ilogoak [...] put <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> my mouth... Ilogoak pointed the gun at us. I was afraid and I was crying... Sinnisiak said to me 'We ought to kill these white men before they kill us.'" [...] Partly due to a previous incident with similar circumstances following which no action was taken, the authorities wished to make an example out of the two Inuit men, and Sinnisiak was tried in Edmonton for the murder of Rouvière, largely because it was thought that Sinnisiak had been the 'ringleader'. He was found not guilty because the jury thought that the Inuit man had cause to kill the priest.|$|E

2500|$|A bowler {{releases}} a normal fast delivery with the wrist locked in {{position and the}} first two fingers positioned {{on top of the}} cricket ball, giving it spin about a horizontal axis perpendicular to the length of the pitch. For a leg cutter, a right-handed bowler pulls his fingers down {{the left side of the}} ball (from his viewpoint), rolling the ball out of <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> the little finger, in an action similar to bowling a leg break, only at higher speed. This changes the axis of spin to make it more like a leg break, which makes the ball deviate to the left when it bounces on the pitch. From a right-handed batsman's point of view, this deviation is to the right, or from the leg side towards the off side. This deviation is known as cut, and the delivery is called a leg cutter because it moves away from the leg side.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin chose an allegorical {{scene from}} Exodus, {{described}} in his notes as [...] "Moses {{standing on the}} Shore, and extending <b>his</b> <b>Hand</b> <b>over</b> the Sea, thereby causing the same to overwhelm Pharaoh who is sitting in an open Chariot, a Crown on his Head and a Sword in his Hand. Rays from a Pillar of Fire in the Clouds reaching to Moses, to express that he acts by Command of the Deity." [...] Motto, [...] "Rebellion to Tyrants is Obedience to God." [...] Jefferson suggested a depiction of the Children of Israel in the wilderness, led by a cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night for {{the front of the}} seal; and Hengest and Horsa, the two brothers who were the legendary leaders of the first Anglo-Saxon settlers in Britain, for the reverse side of the seal. Adams chose a painting known as the [...] "Judgment of Hercules" [...] where the young Hercules must choose to travel either on the flowery path of self-indulgence or the rugged, more difficult, uphill path of duty to others and honor to himself.|$|E

He grabbed her arm, took her into the bathroom and declared: 'Look, you are so right, I am really sorry.' He kept her there for five minutes, then swaggered out, his image intact." [...] Julie Parrish, Presley's co-star in Paradise Hawaiian Style, relates, [...] "One time on set I had a real pain in my side – a side-effect, I think – and Elvis scooped me up, carried me into his trailer and shut the door. Outside the crew was waiting and wondering, but Elvis was oblivious to the innuendo. He placed <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> my side and tried to do some healing on me." [...] Playboy star and actress June Wilkinson remembered that she [...] "met Elvis on the set of King Creole. He invited me to dinner at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel. ... Then Elvis gave me a tour of his suite, sat me on the bed in his bedroom and sang to me for two hours. That was it. The next day ... we had dinner again. He was very sweet, and he was friendly. He had more than sex on his mind. He got me to the airport on time, and our paths never crossed again." ...|$|E
