40|$|We derive the scaling {{dimension}} {{associated with}} <b>crossing</b> <b>bonds</b> in the random-cluster {{representation of the}} two-dimensional Potts model, {{by means of a}} mapping on the Coulomb gas. The scaling field associated with <b>crossing</b> <b>bonds</b> appears to be irrelevant, on the critical {{as well as on the}} tricritical branch. The latter result stands in a remarkable contrast with the existing result for the tricritical O(n) model that <b>crossing</b> <b>bonds</b> are relevant. In order to obtain independent confirmation of the Coulomb gas result for the crossing-bond exponent, we perform a finite-size-scaling analysis based on numerical transfer-matrix calculations.

Built in 1914, the structure was {{designed in the}} Neoclassical style, with Oscar Wenderoth as the supervising architect. The 1893 Colombian Exposition in Chicago was a major influence in the building's design. [...] The foundation is composed of North Carolina granite, while the walls are dark red brick that is laid in an <b>English</b> <b>cross</b> <b>bond.</b> The main entrance is framed by a portico that is held up by four columns of the Doric order. The interior features woodwork of white oak, a marble-terrazo floor, and a vaulted ceiling. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.|$|E

50|$|The old Groton High School is a {{historic}} school building at 145 ain Street in Groton, Massachusetts. It has also variously been known as the Prescott School, Groton Junior High School, and Butler School. The building is two stories, with a flat roof. It is divided into four sections: a central portion that protrudes slightly from the main facade, which is topped by a pedimented gable, two wings that flank the central portion, and a rear section behind the central building. Because the building sits on a sloping lot, the rear section is actually three full stories; its ground floor section is made of concrete, {{while the rest of}} the building is predominantly made of brick, laid in a variation of an <b>English</b> <b>cross</b> <b>bond</b> pattern. The central portion was built in 1871 to a design by Henry M. Francis, originally with Second Empire styling, and named the Butler School in honor of a long-serving town clerk, Caleb Butler. The school served all grades until 1915.|$|E
50|$|For {{efficient}} {{handling and}} laying, bricks must be small enough and {{light enough to}} be picked up by the bricklayer using one hand (leaving the other hand free for the trowel). Bricks are usually laid flat, and as a result, the effective limit on the width of a brick is set by the distance which can conveniently be spanned between the thumb and fingers of one hand, normally about four inches (about 100 mm). In most cases, the length of a brick is about twice its width, about eight inches (about 200 mm) or slightly more. This allows bricks to be laid bonded in a structure which increases stability and strength (for an example, see the illustration of bricks laid in English bond, at the head of this article). The wall is built using alternating courses of stretchers, bricks laid longways, and headers, bricks laid crossways. The headers tie the wall together over its width. In fact, this wall is built in a variation of English bond called <b>English</b> <b>cross</b> <b>bond</b> where the successive layers of stretchers are displaced horizontally from each other by half a brick length. In true English bond, the perpendicular lines of the stretcher courses are in line with each other.|$|E
5000|$|Upham HallThe first {{building}} built {{specifically for}} college purposes was Upham Hall. It was originally named the Administration Building {{when it was}} built in 1939 and was also known as Liberal Arts Hall before it was named after Mother Mary Geraldine in 1963. The building was designed by Davenport architects Seth Temple and his son Arthur Temple in the Collegiate Gothic style. It was built by John C. Tunnicliff Construction Company for $165,000. [...] Upham Hall rises three floors on the north facade, which faces the center of the campus, and four flours and a tall foundation level on the south elevation. The foundation of the building is poured concrete, the walls are of the mottled red face brick used in other Marycrest buildings, and Bedford stone trim. The rectangular building features a central pavilion of four bays that is faced with Bedford stone to the third floor. Extending to the east and west are wings of five bays each whose brick is laid in an <b>English</b> <b>cross</b> <b>bond</b> with alternating courses of headers and stretchers. The Tudor arched main entrance is flanked by simple stone buttresses with vertical ornamentation. Simple brick buttresses separate the bays on the west wing. The east wing is dominated by four two-story Tudor arched windows. They denote the location of the 300-seat auditorium whose stage is against the central pavilion. Upham Hall has been used for a variety of purposes including as administrative offices, classrooms, some of which were used temporarily as dormitory rooms, faculty offices, the first chapel, an auditorium, and a gymnasium.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{properties}} of the low-temperature phase of the O($n$) loop model in two dimensions by means of transfer-matrix calculations and finite-size scaling. We determine the stability of this phase with respect to several kinds of perturbations, including cubic anisotropy, attraction between loop segments, double <b>bonds</b> and <b>crossing</b> <b>bonds.</b> In line with Coulomb gas predictions, cubic anisotropy and <b>crossing</b> <b>bonds</b> are found to be relevant and introduce crossover to different types of behavior. Whereas perturbations in the form of loop-loop attractions and double bonds are irrelevant, sufficiently strong perturbations of these types induce a phase transition of the Ising type, at least in the cases investigated. This Ising transition leaves the underlying universal low-temperature O($n$) behavior unaffected. Comment: 12 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
