40|$|International audienceThe {{rheological}} properties of short fiber reinforced polypropylene were investigated. Flax and Tencel® are two cellulose based fibers used <b>in</b> this study. <b>Flax</b> fibers are {{extracted from the}} bast of plants. They are composed of thin elementary fibers and rigid thick bundles made of elementary fibers “glued” together. Tencel® is a man-made cellulosic fiber spun from cellulose solution, with a uniform diameter, thin, and flexible. First, fiber dimensions before and after compounding were analyzed. Both types of fibers were broken during compounding. Flax shows larger length and diameter than Tencel®, but aspect ratio of flax is smaller. The reason is that after compounding <b>flax</b> remained <b>in</b> <b>bundles.</b> Dynamic viscosity, elastic and viscousmoduli were studied {{as a function of}} fiber type, concentration (from 0 to 30 [*]wt. %), and composite temperature (from 180 to 200 [*]°C). All Tencel®-based composites showed higher apparent yield stress,viscosity, and moduli compared to flax-based composites at the same fiber concentrations. The results are analyzed in terms of the influence of fiber type, aspect ratio, and flexibility. The importance of considering fiber morphology is demonstrated as far as it controls fiber flexibility and fiber-fiber interactions...|$|R
50|$|Several {{methods are}} used for retting flax. It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the retting is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are {{standing}} out from the stalks. When wrapped around a finger, the inner woody part springs away from the fibers. Pond retting is the fastest. It consists of placing the <b>flax</b> <b>in</b> {{a pool of water}} which will not evaporate. It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of retting also produces quite an odor. Stream retting is similar to pool retting, but the <b>flax</b> is submerged <b>in</b> <b>bundles</b> <b>in</b> a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than pond retting, but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted. Both pond and stream retting were traditionally used less because they pollute the waters used for the process.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} {{of water on}} the mechanical properties of wood has been investigated in situ using X-ray microdiffraction on tangential cuts and single fibres of pine earlywood. Simultaneously, the orientation and elongation of the cellulose crystallites inside the composite material has been monitored during tensile stretching experiments. The softening {{in the beginning of the}} macroscopic stress-strain curve of the samples with a moisture content above the fibre saturation point has been localised in the matrix surrounding the microfibrils, lining up along the direction of the external tension force. Interestingly, the strain-hardening close to rupture has been independent on water content, possibly due to the strong bonds, apparently unaffected by the water molecules, along the polymer chains. Additionally, the local dynamics of a <b>flax</b> fibre <b>bundle</b> <b>in</b> wet and dry state have been studied by means of inelastic neutron scattering showing a clear anisotropy for motions between 2 and 7 meV at 300 and 180 K originating from the changes in the less ordered regions accessible for water...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{evidence}} {{suggested that}} byssinosis <b>in</b> <b>flax</b> workers {{is caused by}} the inhalation of dust of biologically retted <b>flax.</b> <b>In</b> the present study no cases of byssinosis were found among workers <b>in</b> a <b>flax</b> plant which produces yarn by chemical degumming instead of biological retting.
