25|$|The Third Edition of {{the game}} was {{published}} as a single hardback book in 1987. It had the most in-depth and complex movement and manoeuvre system of any edition.

It kept the same magic system and open-ended army <b>design</b> <b>system</b> as the first two editions. However, by this stage the use of army lists was very much encouraged. Army lists for this edition were published in a separate book called Warhammer Armies in 1988; until then, use of the 2nd Edition's Ravening Hordes list was encouraged. This is partly because it was the last edition published before Games Workshop took a different commercial approach, leading to competition from former GW employees in the briefly published competing Fantasy Warlord.|$|E

500|$|The next step, {{a hearing}} before the Georgia Supreme Court, was held on December 15. In {{addition}} to presenting the existing written record, each side was granted two hours for oral arguments. In addition to the old arguments, the defense focused on the reservations expressed by Judge Roan at the reconsideration hearing, citing six cases where new trials had been granted after the trial judge expressed misgivings about the jury verdict. The prosecution countered with arguments that the evidence convicting Frank was substantial and that listing Judge Roan's doubts in the defense's bill of exceptions was not the proper vehicle for [...] "carry {{the views of the}} judge." [...] On February 17, 1914, in a 142-page decision, the court denied Frank a new trial by a 4–2 vote. The majority dismissed the allegations of bias by the jurors, saying the power of determining this rested strictly with the trial judge except when an [...] "abuse of discretion" [...] was proved. It also ruled that spectator influence could only be the basis of a new trial if ruled so by the trial judge. Conley's testimony on Frank's alleged sexual conduct was found to be admissible because, even though it suggested Frank had committed other crimes for which he was not charged, it made Conley's statements more credible and helped to explain Frank's motivation for committing the crime according to the majority. On Judge Roan's stated reservations, the court ruled that these did not trump his legal decision to deny a motion for a new trial. The dissenting justices restricted their opinion to Conley's testimony, which they declared should not have been allowed to stand: [...] "It is perfectly clear to us that evidence of prior bad acts of lasciviousness committed by the defendant... did not tend to prove a preexisting <b>design,</b> <b>system,</b> plan, or scheme, directed toward making an assault upon the deceased or killing her to prevent its disclosure." [...] They concluded that the evidence prejudiced Frank in the jurors' eyes and denied him a fair trial.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} work is to {{investigate}} the algorithms of speech recognition. The author programmed and simulated the <b>designed</b> <b>systems</b> for algorithms of speech recognition in MATLAB. There are two <b>systems</b> <b>designed</b> in this thesis. One {{is based on the}} shape information of the cross-correlation plotting. The other one is to use the Wiener Filter to realize the speech recognition. The simulations of the programmed systems in MATLAB are accomplished by using the microphone to record the speaking words. After running the program in MATLAB, MATLAB will ask people to record the words three times. The first and second recorded words are different words which will be used as the reference signals in the <b>designed</b> <b>systems.</b> The third recorded word is the same word as the one of the first two recorded words. After recording words, the words will become the signals’ information which will be sampled and stored in MATLAB. Then MATLAB should be able to give the judgment that which word is recorded at the third time compared with the first two reference words according to the algorithms programmed in MATLAB. The author invited different people from different countries to test the <b>designed</b> <b>systems.</b> The results of simulations for both <b>designed</b> <b>systems</b> show that the <b>designed</b> <b>systems</b> both work well when the first two reference recordings and the third time recording are recorded from the same person. But the <b>designed</b> <b>systems</b> all have the defects when the first two reference recordings and the third time recording are recorded from the different people. However, if the testing environment is quiet enough and the speaker is the same person for three time recordings, the successful probability of the speech recognition is approach to 100 %. Thus, the <b>designed</b> <b>systems</b> actually work well for the basical speech recognition...|$|R
