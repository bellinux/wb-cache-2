5000|$|An {{investigating}} panel {{had quickly}} identified piping {{as the most}} probable cause of the failure, then focused its efforts on determining how the piping started. Two mechanisms were possible. The first was {{the flow of water}} under highly erodible and unprotected fill, through joints in unsealed rock beneath the <b>grout</b> <b>cap</b> and development of an erosion tunnel. The second was [...] "cracking caused by differential strains or hydraulic fracturing of the core material." [...] The panel was unable to determine whether one or the other mechanism occurred, or a combination: ...|$|E
40|$|Non-destructive {{evaluation}} (NDE) of bridge {{stay cable}} and external post-tensioning (PT) systems {{is an essential}} tool to thorough bridge inspections and also eliminates any necessary repair of destructions made during evaluation. Conditions such as corrosion, steel strand and wire breakage, tendon section loss, voids in the grout, water infiltration, and other undesired grout conditions can go undetected in nontransparent stay cable and external PT ducts without proper inspection. In this research, sounding, ultrasonic tomography, infrared thermography, and ground penetrating radar are evaluated for their applicability to identify selected conditions in a mock-up specimen representative of both a stay cable system and an external PT system. A borescope {{is also used to}} collect ground truth data for comparison with the NDE results. The conditions are fabricated in the mock-up specimen to closely represent conditions in the field so that the NDE results are directly applicable to bridge construction quality control and in-service bridge inspections. Locations of corrosion, breakage, and section loss are established prior to grouting. These conditions are combined with both foam void locations and an air-filled void in the grout {{along the top of the}} duct. The sounding method was extremely applicable in accurately detecting air voids in the grout and the sounding results matched closely with the ground truth data of the air void extent collected by the use of a borescope. This research concludes that the infrared thermography and ground penetrating radar devices used did not identify any of the corrosion, section loss, or breakage locations within the specimen. However, both of these methods identified air voids and foam voids in the duct free span during both the quality control testing period and inspection testing period, although GPR did not provide accurate void depth. In addition, infrared thermography was able to identify air voids within the <b>grout</b> <b>caps</b> at each anchorage end. The ultrasonic tomograph used in this research, designed for use on concrete rather than stay cables and external PT, produced inconsistent results when used on the specimen. In future research, a different means of ultrasonic tomography testing may be applicable to identifying voids in the grout...|$|R
40|$|Hanford has 149 single-shell {{high level}} waste (HLW) tanks that were {{constructed}} between 1943 and 1964. Many of these tanks have leaked or {{are suspected of}} leaking HLW into the soil above the ground water. Consequently, a major effort is ongoing to transfer the liquid portion of the waste to the 28 newer, double-shell tanks. Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) was tasked to develop grout formulations for the three-layer closure concept selected by CH 2 M HILL for closing Tank C- 106. These grout formulations were also evaluated for use as fill materials {{in the next six}} tanks scheduled to be closed. The overall scope consisted of both bench-scale testing to confirm mix designs and scale-up testing to confirm placement properties. This report provides results of the scale-up testing for the three-phase tank closure strategy. It also contains information on grouts for equipment and riser filling. The three-phase fill strategy is summarized as follows: Phase I fill encapsulates and minimizes dispersion of the residual waste in the tank. This fill {{is referred to as the}} Stabilization Layer and consists of the Stabilization Grout. The Phase II fill provides structural stability to the tank system and prevents subsidence. It is referred to as the Structural Layer and consists of the Structural Grout. A final Phase III fill consists of a grout designed to provide protection against intrusion and is referred to as the Capping Layer or <b>Capping</b> <b>Grout...</b>|$|R
