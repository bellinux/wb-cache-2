40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} {{the performance of the}} stormwater best management practices (BMPs) installed on the Belknap campus at the University of Louisville, a comprehensive assessment on the stormwater BMPs’ the flow volume reduction, peak flow attenuation, and <b>overflow</b> <b>area</b> abatement was made. We used a two-pronged analysis based on 1) predictive modeling using data mining approach; 2) model-based hydraulic simulation. The novelty of study is that it not only assessed the stormwater BMPs’ performances on flow volume reduction, but also assessed their performance on peak flow attenuation which is neglected in previous studies and assessment practices. Flow volume reduction and peak flow attenuation were assessed through mining the rainfall and combined sewer flow data before and after the BMPs’ installation. The stormwater BMPs’ performances on <b>overflow</b> <b>area</b> abatement were assessed through contrasting the <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> before and after the BMPs’ installation. The radar rainfall data was verified using the local rain gauge data, and the rainfall event is sorted out using a 6 hour dry period. The data mining in this study includes rainfall data validation, data preparation, and modelling. The predictive Multiple Linear Regression Models (MLRMs) and Back Propagation Neural Network Models (BPNNM) were built. For the study area, flow volume in wet weather is mostly controlled by rainfall depth, and followed rainfall duration. Peak flow is decided by rainfall depth, peak rainfall intensity, duration and duration of above average rainfall intensity. Peak flow is negatively correlated with rainfall duration, while positively correlated with other three features. According to both model, the estimated volume of the flow diverted by the stormwater BMPs are approximately 30 million gallons per year, and the magnitude of the peak flow could be trimmed down by approximately 50 %. Multiple linear regression and backpropagation neural network are evaluation methods which are not only applicable in the studied case, but also can be widely adopted. However, it shows that the BPNNM is only viable to predict for flow volume lower than 6 million gallons. The <b>overflow</b> <b>area</b> abatement was assessed through contrasting the <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> before and after the installation of the stormwater BMPs. <b>Overflow</b> <b>areas</b> were visualized by performing coupled 1 D/ 2 D hydraulic simulation. It shows that the <b>overflow</b> <b>areas,</b> which could be saved by the stormwater BMPs, depend on the magnitude of the rainfall event. The abatement in <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> is more evident at 4 inch rainfall event and the 1 inch rainfall event. In the 4 inch rainfall event, the <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> at the JB Speed School parking lot, Student Rec Center, and College of Business were significantly abated by the stormwater BMPs...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION 3 (2) - 1 THE INDEXED-SEQUENTIAL FILE The indexed-sequential file design {{attempts}} {{to overcome the}} access problem inherent in the sequential file organization without losing all the benefits and tradition associated with sequential files. Two features {{are added to the}} organization of the sequential file to arrive at this third file organization type. One additional feature is an index to the file to provide better random access; the other is an <b>overflow</b> <b>area</b> to provide a means to handle additions to the file. Figure 3 - 6 shows a particular example of an indexed-sequential file.

50|$|Due to {{the very}} high {{groundwater}} fluctuations and {{despite the lack of}} space, a sealed ground water lake with a high water table was built. The lakes water-impermeable layers (tertiary) are sealed around and create a dense run off trough. To avoid groundwater damming, three basic water transfers (culverts) were built allow water to transfer from south to north, and in addition to the run off area, the groundwater is pumped out of the ground in the other surrounding areas and flows into the lake. Through an <b>overflow</b> <b>area</b> at the western end of the lake, the access water is purified in the infiltration basin and fed into the ground water. Through the exchange of water, a consistent water quality can be ensured.|$|R

40|$|The Somme River Basin {{is located}} above a chalk aquifer and the {{discharge}} of the somme River is highly influenced by groundwater inflow (90 % of river discharge is baseflow). In 2001, the Somme River Basin suffered from a major flood causing damages estimated to 100 million Euro (Deneux and Martin, 2001). The {{purpose of the present}} research is to evaluate the ability of four hydrologic models to reproduce flood events in the Somme River Basin over an 18 -year period, by comparison with observed river discharge and piezometric head as well as satellite-derived extents of the flooded area. The models used differ in their computation of the surface water budget and in their representation of saturated and unsaturated zones. One model needed structural modification to be able to accurately simulate the riverflows of the Somme river. The models obtained fair to good simulations of the observed piezometric heads, but they all overestimate the piezometric level after flooding, possibly because of a simplistic representation of the deep unsaturated flow. Models differ in their annual partition of the infiltration of water within the root zone (mostly driven by simulated evapotranspiration), but these differences are attenuated by water transfers within the saturated and unsaturated zone. As a consequence, the inter-model dispersion of the computed annual baseflow is reduced. The aquifer <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> simulated during flooding compare well with local data and satellite images. The models showed that this overflow occurs almost every year in the same areas (in the floodplain), and that the flooding of 2001 was characterized by an increase in the quantity of the overflow and not much by a spreading of the <b>overflow</b> <b>areas.</b> Inconsistencies between river discharge and piezometric levels suggest that further investigation are needed to estimate the relative influence of unsaturated and saturated zones on the hydrodynamics of the Somme River Basin...|$|R
