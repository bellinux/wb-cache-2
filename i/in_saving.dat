40|$|The federal Truth <b>in</b> <b>Savings</b> Act (Truth <b>in</b> <b>Savings)</b> {{provides}} {{one example}} of failed legislative problem solving. On its face, Truth <b>in</b> <b>Savings</b> is a congressional attempt to solve constituents 2 ̆ 7 problems. The statute, however, appears unlikely to resolve the issues presented to Congress and may even create new and unintended problems that will make matters worse. Truth <b>in</b> <b>Savings,</b> like many other legislative efforts, fails adequately to address constituents 2 ̆ 7 problems because the methodology employed by legislative drafters suffers from a fundamental flaw - it has no built-in mechanism to define rigorously the problem being addressed. Without first identifying the problem, legislation stands little chance of providing an effective solution. This Article {{is divided into three}} parts. Part I presents a case study of Truth <b>in</b> <b>Savings</b> as a failed congressional attempt to solve a perceived problem. Part II examines the deficiencies in the problem-solving methodology employed in the legislative process that produced Truth <b>in</b> <b>Savings.</b> Finally, Part III discusses prospects for improving the methodology employed in the legislative process...|$|R

5|$|A {{few years}} later, in 1835 his native {{province}} of Rio Grande do Sul was engulfed in a secessionist rebellion, the Ragamuffin War. The conflict lasted for almost ten years, and the Count was leading military engagements {{for most of}} that time. He played a decisive role <b>in</b> <b>saving</b> the provincial capital from the Ragamuffin rebels, allowing forces loyal to the legitimate government to secure a key foothold. In 1852, he led a Brazilian division during the Platine War in an invasion of the Argentine Confederation that overthrew its dictator. He was awarded a noble title, eventually raised from baron to viscount and finally to count.|$|E

Seale writes that Abu Nidal's absence from Jordan during this period, when it was clear that King Hussein was about to act against the Palestinians, raised suspicion within the movement that Abu Nidal was interested only <b>in</b> <b>saving</b> himself.|$|E

5|$|Diffusion {{of crude}} natural gas through special {{semipermeable}} membranes and other barriers is another method {{to recover and}} purify helium.

At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM {{per year in the}} U.S.; see pie chart below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors <b>in</b> <b>saving</b> and processing impact effective reserve numbers.|$|E
