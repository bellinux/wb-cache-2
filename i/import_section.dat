Changes in {{the health}} sector in South Africa have been {{widespread}} since 1994 with restructuring ofthe public sector being {{the focal point of}} legislation. The limelight has recently shifted focus to the health sector with the Medicine and Related Substances (MRSCA) Amendment Act, 59 of 2002 in which generic substitution was finally promulgated, after disputes in the international arena about patent rights, due to the government's policy on parallel <b>imports.</b> <b>Section</b> 12 ofPharmacy Act 90, which forms part of the Act is an attempt to further regulate the industry, that eventually became effective this year. This legislation addresses issues of sampling and perverse incentives and calls {{for the establishment of a}} Marketing Code for the pharmaceutical industry. The South African government has, as part of the amendment, called for input from all stakeholders including: trade associations, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession. All role players were invited to be part of the decisionmaking process as to what should constitute the Marketing Code and its' regulatory body. The Society of Psychiatrists (SASOP), an affiliate of the South African Medical Association (SAMA), has not yet prepared a response to SAMA for submission to government with regard to the Marketing Code, in the field of central nervous system (CNS) products. The impact of the banning of samples on psychiatric private practice is not known and there is insufficient data available about the marketing activities of drug companies and the link to the prescription habits of medical professionals. Further, to date, there has been no canvassing of opinions with regard to the impact of the legislation on the consumer. In this case study analysis, an evaluation of the impact of legislative changes in the South African pharmaceutical industry is made. Recommendations as to what should constitute a Marketing Code for the pharmaceutical industry are highlighted. restructuring ofthe public sector being the focal point of legislation.

40|$|In his {{concurring opinion}} in Crawford v. Washington, Chief Justice Rehnquist criticized the {{majority}} for holding that the Confrontation Clause applies to “testimonial” statements but leaving for “another day” {{any effort to}} define sufficiently what “testimonial” means. Prosecutors and defendants, he said, “should not {{be left in the}} dark in this manner. ” Over the next two years, both sides grappled with the meaning of testimonial, each gleaning <b>import</b> from <b>sections</b> of Crawford that seemingly proved their test was the right one. When the Court granted certiorari in Davis v. Washington and Hammon v. Indiana (hereinafter Davis), hopes were high that the Court would provide the answers—the definitive test for testimonial. Not surprisingly, it did not...|$|R
50|$|In 1983, the <b>import</b> parts <b>section</b> of the SEMA Show {{was added}} {{under the auspices}} of sister organization, Automotive International Association, thus {{changing}} the name to SEMA/AI Show. In 1984, there was a combined SEMA/AI/APAA Show in Las Vegas. The Industry Awards Banquet was held at the MGM Grand, and the entertainment was provided by The Platters and Gallagher. By all indications, the move to Las Vegas has been an overwhelming success. In 1986, Car and Driver magazine noted that the Show was a “...prime opportunity to monitor the West Coast car culture without breathing the smog or fighting the freeways.” That same year, Jay Leno made his first appearance on stage at the SEMA Show Industry Awards Banquet.|$|R

Moreover, Fischer continues to claim that his use of Justice Hobbs’ article did not constitute plagiarism, because the article {{was part of the}} [...] "public domain". Fischer also admits that he did not disclose to McInnis that he had imported the work of Justice Hobbs. [...] "'Mr. Fischer alone chose to <b>import</b> large <b>sections</b> of text previously written by the Honorable Justice Gregory Hobbs into one of the articles drafted for Mr. McInnis, without credit citation,' states the results of the investigation." ...|$|R
40|$|The report {{looks at}} how China 2 ̆ 7 s {{changing}} demand for coal could impact coal-related assets in Australia, {{which is a}} large and growing coal exporter to China. AimsThis report investigates how China’s demand for coal is changing {{as a result of}} environment-related factors, such as regulation, developments in cleaner technologies, local environmental pollution, improving energy efficiency, changing resource landscapes and political activism. The report looks at how this changing demand picture could then translate into impacts on coal and coal-related assets in Australia, which is a large and growing coal exporter to China. Investors, businesses and communities, as well as state and federal governments in Australia, could be affected by a slowdown in Chinese demand for coal. Changing demand and falling prices could result in ‘stranded assets’, where assets have suffered from unanticipated or premature write-downs, devaluations or conversion to liabilities. This report aims to provide a greater understanding of the various market dynamics involved, the potential significance of different environment-related factors and an indication of what this could mean for Australian coal assets. It is {{the first of a series}} of studies looking at coal and stranded assets internationally. This report contains five sections. The first section provides some background and methodological guidance. Section two surveys China’s coal market and Australia’s coal exports to China. Section three looks at environmentrelated factors in turn and assesses how each could change China’s coal demand and <b>imports.</b> <b>Section</b> four looks at how a reduction in China’s demand for coal could impact Australian coal assets. The final section provides some guidance so that stakeholders can better manage environment-related risks that have the potential to strand coal assets...|$|R
