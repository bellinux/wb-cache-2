40|$|AbstractNanomedicine is an {{emerging}} form of therapy {{that focuses on}} alternative drug delivery and improvement of the treatment efficacy while reducing detrimental side effects to normal tissues. Cancer drug resistance is a complicated process that involves multiple mechanisms. Here we discuss the major forms of drug resistance and the new possibilities that nanomedicines offer to overcome these treatment obstacles. Novel nanomedicines that have a high ability for flexible, fast drug design and production based on tumor genetic profiles can be created making drug selection <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> patient <b>treatment</b> much more intensive and effective. This review aims to demonstrate {{the advantage of the}} young medical science field, nanomedicine, for overcoming cancer drug resistance. With the advanced design and alternative mechanisms of drug delivery known for different nanodrugs including liposomes, polymer conjugates, micelles, dendrimers, carbon-based, and metallic nanoparticles, overcoming various forms of multi-drug resistance looks promising and opens new horizons for cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|Arsenic is a toxic {{metalloid}} {{element that}} is now recognised {{to be an important}} contaminant of drinking water – particularly, but not exclusively, in poor regions of southern Asia. In effected regions, many millions are at risk of arsenic-induced disease and strategies are required to provide safe water for consumption. The main strategies available are mitigation (the provision of alternative arsenic-free water) and remediation (arsenic removal from extracted water). Consideration of local conditions suggests that for many areas remediation, at an affordable cost, is the only practical option. Remediation technologies are available, but most have been developed for industrial-scale arsenic removal at central water treatment plants. The options <b>for</b> local / <b>personal</b> <b>treatment</b> of water are less well developed. The available methods include arsenic removal by precipitation / co-precipitation and filtration, removal by adsorption onto artificial and natural sorbents, water softening with lime, ion exchange onto activated alumina, membrane processes and bioremediation. This review considers the technical aspects and the appropriateness of these options...|$|R

Here, Dinesh tells the doctor {{that he had}} been {{listening}} to a voice for a few days and it has been troubling him. Upon questioning the source of the voice, Dinesh tells that the voice sounds like that of God, if he were present really. The doctor asks Dinesh to come along with him <b>for</b> a <b>personal</b> <b>treatment</b> where Dinesh tells him that he had killed his friend Ravi. The doctor asks Dinesh to relax and hypnotises him in his sleep where he asks him various questions. It is revealed that a clever Dinesh had been recently married to a beautiful orphan Aishwarya (Arundhati Nair) who had contacted him through a matrimonial site. After their return from their Honeymoon trip, Dinesh starts hallucinating and listening to voices in his head. Also, his best friend Ravi who comes to help him gets killed in an accident due to Dinesh. The voice in Dinesh's head keeps telling him to die and Dinesh sees miserable things on TV screens, computer screens and distorted bruised faces near the windows. After the treatment, the doctor tells Dinesh not to wander off alone and tells his boss that Dinesh has got disturbed memories of his past life.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Title: Forgotten Vision. The {{perception}} of elderly {{in a nursing}} home on the <b>personal</b> <b>treatment</b> by caregivers. Background and objectives: Although the importance of perceptions of elderly on <b>personal</b> <b>treatment</b> and quality of care in nursing homes is acknowledged, research regarding this subject remains scarce. To date no study has investigated the perceptions of elderly living {{in a nursing home}} in the Netherlands about the <b>personal</b> <b>treatment</b> given by caregivers. The aim {{of this study was to}} provide a general description of the {{perception of}} elderly in a nursing home on the <b>personal</b> <b>treatment</b> by caregivers. Study design and method: A qualitative survey, using semi-structured interviews for data collection. Setting: A representative nursing home in a middle large town in the Netherlands. Study population: Elderly without cognitive impairments living in a nursing home. From this population a purposive sample was drawn consisting of 15 elderly. Results: Elderly expressed the need for their caregiver to be: friendly, calm, understanding, respectful and involved. The most important finding is the assumptions made by elderly in relation to communicating and connecting with caregivers. Due to these assumptions elderly were reluctant to share their wishes and needs with caregivers. This is limiting the relation between elderly and caregiver and therefore of influence on <b>personal</b> <b>treatment</b> within this relationship. Conclusion: Findings from this study give insight in how elderly in a nursing home want to be personally treated by caregivers in terms of behavior but more importantly reveal the influence of elderly on <b>personal</b> <b>treatment.</b> Because of the reticence of elderly due to the assumptions an extra claim on the attentiveness of caregivers is made. It is important that caregivers are capable to fulfil this claim. This involves practical implications such as adjusting the nursing system and education of caregivers...|$|R
40|$|Interest in {{self-care}} haemodialysis (HD) {{has increased}} because it improves patients'clinical and quality-of-life outcomes. Patients who undertake self-management for haemodialysis may hold illness beliefs differently to those choosing institutional {{care at the}} time of making the modality choice or moulded by their illness and dialysis treatment experience. Illness perceptions amongst predialysis patients and in those undertaking fully-assisted and self-care haemodialysis are being investigated in a combined cross-sectional and longitudinal study. The study data are derived from the BASIC-HHD study, a multicentre observational study on factors influencing home haemodialysis uptake. 535 patients were enrolled into three groups: Predialysis CKD- 5 group, prevalent 'in-centre' HD and self-care HD groups (93 % at home). We explore illness perceptions in the cross-sectional analyses of the three study groups, using the revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R). Predialysis patients' illness beliefs were reassessed prospectively, typically between 4 and 12 months after dialysis commencement. Illness belief subscales are significantly different between in-centre and self-care HD groups. In a step-wise hierarchical regression analysis, after adjustment for age, education, marital status, diabetes, dialysis vintage, depression, anxiety scores, and IPQ-R subscales, personal control (p = 0. 01) and illness coherence (p = 0. 04) are significantly higher in the self-care HD group. In the predialysis group, no significant associations were found between illness representations and modality choices. In prospectively observed predialysis group, scores <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> control, <b>treatment</b> control, timeline cyclical and emotional representations reduced significantly after commencing dialysis and increased significantly for illness coherence. Illness beliefs differ between hospital and self-care haemodialysis patients. Patient's affect and neurocognitive ability may have an important role in determining illness beliefs. The impact of modality upon illness representations may also be significant and remains to be explored...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathophysiological}} {{functions of}} cardiac histamine level and related histamine receptors {{during the development}} of chronic heart failure (CHF) were intensively investigated previously. However, the relevance of polymorphisms in histamine-related genes, such as HRH 2, HRH 3, DAO, and HNMT, with CHF remains largely neglected. This study herein aims to analyze the clinical associations of polymorphisms in those genes with CHF risk. A total of 333 unrelated Chinese Han CHF patients and 354 ethnicity-matched healthy controls were recruited and 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped. We found that the HRH 3 rs 3787429 polymorphism was associated with CHF risk (p< 0. 001). The T allele of rs 3787429 exhibited protective effect against CHF under the dominant (ORs = 0. 455; 95 % CIs = 0. 322 – 0. 642) and additive models (ORs = 0. 662; 95 % CIs = 0. 523 – 0. 838), while, for SNPs in HRH 2, DAO, and HNMT, no significant associations were observed in the present study. These findings {{for the first time}} screen out one SNP (rs 3787429) of HRH 3 gene that was significantly associated with CHF in Chinese Han population, which may be a novel biomarker <b>for</b> <b>personal</b> prevention and <b>treatment</b> of CHF and provides novel highlights for investigating the contribution of this disease...|$|R

40|$|As a {{major part}} of {{corporate}} social responsibility (CSR) practices, Chinese companies have emphasized employee satisfaction to achieve sustainable development. However, it is still unclear how employees perceive organizational CSR efforts and whether such perceptions bring employee satisfaction and loyalty. To answer these timely inquires, we developed and empirically tested a theoretical framework modeling employee satisfaction as both mediator and moderator on the relationship between employee perception of organizational CSR efforts and their loyalty to enterprises. Based on 438 usable questionnaires collected from four typical companies, we found that solely providing money-related welfare and improving the working environment can be detrimental to employee loyalty, but by increasing employee satisfaction of <b>personal</b> <b>treatment,</b> companies can mitigate such a side-effect. Employee satisfaction of <b>personal</b> <b>treatment</b> and general company effort are necessary to enhance their affective commitment. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|R
