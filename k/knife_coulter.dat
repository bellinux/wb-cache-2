40|$|Surface {{spreading}} of slurry {{leads to}} the inevitable emission of ammonia into the environment. Injection of slurry on grassland reduces these emissions. However, injection of slurry by deep working injector tines with goose foot chisels (wings) requires high draught forces. This type of injection has {{the risk of the}} crop dying back under dry soil conditions and is not possible on all soil types. In recent years, new slurry application techniques for grassland have been developed that achieve a large reduction in emissions of ammonia, but require less draught force. These techniques include cutting a shallow slit in the sward, into which slurry is applied, and application of the slurry in bands on the soil surface using a trailing foot implement. In a series of experiments on sandy loam, day and peat soils, the draught force requirement of single elements of five new slurry application techniques was investigated. The application techniques were a trailed sliding foot element and four shallow injection elements: angled-disc coulters (double-disc opener), thick-disc coulter, flat disc coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter and <b>knife</b> <b>coulter</b> followed by a vertical injection coulter. The application technique, working depth and soil conditions had a significant influence on the draught force. For a working depth of 5 cm, the required draught forces per shallow injector element, measured in this experiment, were in the range of 202 - 706 N for a double-disc opener, 284 - 991 N for a thick-disc coulter, 361 - 1260 N for a flat-disc coulter plus injector and 389 - 1358 N for a <b>knife</b> <b>coulter</b> plus injector. The lowest draught forces occurred on peat soil and the highest forces on dry clay. The trailing foot required an average draught force of 39 N. The draught force of the trailing foot did not relate to the soil conditions but an effect of the grass sward condition was suggested. (C) 1998 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|E

A band of fertilizer {{is placed in the}} bottom of the slot through a tube on the <b>knife.</b> A first <b>coulter</b> fills the slot with soil and compacts the soil above the band. A second coulter forms a mound of soil over the compacted soil and creates an elongated furrow in the soil above and laterally removed from the band.

40|$|Abstract. Electro-osmosys {{principle}} {{consists of}} {{the application of a}} direct current voltage to an anode-cathode system introduced into soil. The effect of this system {{consists of the}} mobilization of water particles from soil and their transport, in {{a very short period of}} time, from the anode to cathode. For the tilling machinery the anode may be a disc-knife and the cathode may be the working part (trash board, <b>coulter</b> <b>knife,</b> furrowers, etc). The soil water transported from the anode to cathode, on the tool-soil contact surface, in consequence, will produce a lubrication of an active surface and through this a great decreasing of the friction forces and implicit of the energy needed for displacing the tool through the soil. The energy needed for tilling the soil represents a great part of a total energy consumed for plants crop. When the soil is tilled by pulling or pushing of the tools for farming, a great part of the tilling energy is consumed for defeating the friction forces from the tool-soil contact surfaces. The active surface of the tilling tool may be properly chosen in order to minimize the frictions, respective the mechanic energies needed for tilling...|$|R
