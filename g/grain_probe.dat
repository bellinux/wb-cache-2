A new commercial electronic <b>grain</b> <b>probe</b> trap (OPI Insector™) has recently been marketed. To make accurate insect management decisions, managers need to know both the insect species and numbers found in their grain. To make good management decisions, trap catch needs to be interpreted for the user. Insect species and grain temperature are two important factors that influence trap catch. Thus, an electronic trap {{needs to be able}} to estimate the species caught and grain temperature. We field tested OPI Insector ™ electronic grain probes in two bins, each containing 32. 6 Tonne of wheat, for a 10 -month period. We compared estimates of insect density (insects/kg wheat) to the Insector counts. A statistical model was used to convert Insector ™ catch into insects per kg. The average Insector ™ manual tip counts and electronic counts were similar for most trapping dates. Stored Grain Advisor Pro (SGA Pro) was modified to automatically read the Insector database and to use a statistical model to estimate Cryptolestes ferrugineus density from trap catch counts and grain temperature. Management decisions using Insector ™ trap-catch estimates for C. ferrugineus density were similar to those made using actual insect density for 11 out of 12 sampling dates for the first grain bin, and 11 out of 12 sampling dates for the second grain bin. The statistical model used to predict insect density from Insector trap catch tended to underestimate C. ferrugineus density when the grain was warmer than 23 °C...|$|E

The isotopic compositions of presolar <b>grains</b> provide <b>probes</b> of galactic evolution and nucleosynthesis in stars, while the abundances and characteristics of presolar grains contain a record of thermal processing in the solar system. Most of the detailed isotopic work has been done on SiC from Murchison and Orgueil, supplemented by a few studies of ordinary and enstatite chondrites. This work investigates SiC in the Colony CO 3. O meteorite. SiC is present in Colony at a matrix-normalized abundance of approximately 3. 7 ppm, much less than in CI chondrites and the matrixes of CM and primitive ordinary and enstatite chondrites. The abundances of SiC and other presolar grains in Colony seem to correlate with the chemical processing that produced CO 3 chondrites. This implies that the known presolar grains experienced the same processing as the bulk CO 3 material and assumes that the parent material was the same as that for other chondrites, including CI. That parent material is most plausibly the average material in the sun s parent molecular cloud. One test of this idea is to look for primary differences between SiC in Colony (and other meteorites) and that in CI and CM chondrites. True differences not related to thermal processing would falsify the assumption that all chondrite classes originated from the same reservoir of presolar dust...|$|R

Recently computed models of steady shocks into partially ionized gas reproduce the two-photon spectral shape, but its observed intensity relative to H-beta and the Balmer continuum is anomalously high.

Well {{correlated to}} dust emission at 100 μm, the anomalous emission is interstellar but its origin is still debated. Some possible explanations relate it to dust: emission of spinning, small (nanometric) grains carrying a permanent electric dipole or magnetic fluctuations in larger (submicronic) <b>grains.</b> To <b>probe</b> {{the origin of the}} anomalous emission, we compare microwave data to dust IR emission and search for specific signatures predicted by models of spinning dust. For the anomalous emission, we use the 23 GHz all-sky map deduced from WMAP data by Miville-Deschenes et al. (2008). The dust emission is traced by IRAS data. Models show that spinning dust emission is little sensitive to the intensity of the radiation field (Go) for 10 <nu< 30 GHz while the corresponding mid-IR emission is proportional to Go. To test this behaviour in our comparison, we derive Go from the dust temperature maps of Schlegel et al. (1998). From all-sky maps, we show that the anomalous emission is better correlated to the emission of small grains (at 12 μm) than to that of big grains (at 100 μm). In addition we show that the former correlation is significantly improved when the 12 μm flux is divided by Go, as predicted by current models of spinning dust.

40|$|We {{consider}} the observational signatures of giant impacts between planetary embryos. While the debris {{released in the}} impact remains in a clump for only a single orbit, there is a much longer lasting asymmetry caused {{by the fact that}} all debris must pass through the collision-point. The resulting asymmetry is stationary, it does not orbit the star. The debris is concentrated in a clump at the collision-point, with a more diffuse structure on the opposite side. The asymmetry lasts for typically around 1000 orbital periods of the progenitor, which can be several Myr at distances of ~ 50 AU. We describe how the appearance of the asymmetric disc depends on the mass and eccentricity of the progenitor, as well as viewing orientation. The wavelength of observation, which determines the <b>grain</b> sizes <b>probed,</b> is also important. Notably, the increased collision rate of the debris at the collision-point makes this the dominant production site for any secondary dust and gas created. For dust small enough to be removed by radiation pressure, and gas with a short lifetime, this causes their distribution to resemble a jet emanating from the (stationary) collision-point. We suggest that the asymmetries seen at large separations in some debris discs, like Beta Pictoris, could be the result of giant impacts. If so this would indicate that planetary embryos are present and continuing to grow at several tens of AU at ages of up to tens of Myr.

40|$|The use of high-energy {{synchrotron}} x-rays {{which has}} enabled three- dimensional structural characterization from the nano- to the macroscopic scale, {{and now to}} the meso-scale, such as individual grains and dislocation structures, is a major scientific advance. This is the first technique with sufficient spatial resolution and penetration power to probe the local structure embedded deep within the material. This, together with good time resolution makes it suitable for investigations of e. g. phase transformations kinetics, stress-strain behaviour, and texture evolution in stainless steels. The micromechanical response of a metastable austenitic stainless steel and a duplex stainless steel during loading has been investigated {{by a series of}} high-energy x-ray diffraction experiments at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) in Argonne, IL, USA. Different measurement scales of the steels are tested, ranging from the behaviour of individual grains up to the macroscopic material behaviour. The experimental data is used as input to material models to validate and improve existing models for strain-induced martensite and mechanical properties. The x-ray investigations have revealed that autocatalytic Ü-martensite transformation is triggered by strains induced by the transformation itself in 301 and this was evidenced as bursts of Ü-martensite transformation during tensile loading. To the author's knowledge this behaviour has not been previously reported, and is of significant importance for the mechanical properties of the metastable stainless steels, since it provides strong local hardening and increases the time to neck formation. The å-martensite formation was investigated for 45 individual austenite bulk grains in 301 and the resolved shear stress was determined. Out of the 45 austenite <b>grains</b> <b>probed</b> one was observed to form å-martensite. The grain that formed å-martensite had the highest Schmid factor for the active slip system during fcc to hcp transformation. The behaviour of 301 during tensile loading at different strain rates was also investigated and it was concluded that even moderate strain rates produce adiabatic heating sufficient to suppress the martensite formation. The strain-induced martensitic transformation and the stress-strain behaviour was predicted by an extended Olson-Cohen model, finite element simulations for the temperature evolution and a radial return algorithm for the stress-strain behaviour. The measured and modelled results were in fair agreement. In addition, the phase specific stresses were measured during the experiments and these were in good agreement with the predicted results from the finite element model. Thus, it was concluded that the employed iso- work principle was a good assumption for the stress distribution between the phases. One way of tailoring the metastable austenitic stainless steels' microstructure with different phase fractions and deformation structures is by the reverse transformation from martensite to austenite. This was investigated for the cold rolled 301 steel, and the reverse transformation was observed to occur via two different mechanisms, one diffusion controlled and the other a diffusionless transformation. The onset of the diffusion reversion was about 450 °C and the shear reversion became active at higher temperatures. The microstructure of shear reversed austenite consists of highly faulted austenite with an inherited lath like structure. The stress response of 15 individual austenite and ferrite grains deeply embedded in the bulk of a duplex stainless steel was measured during tensile loading. These results showed large intergranular stresses acting between grains due to grain interaction. The large intergranular stresses will {{have a significant effect on}} the two-phase behaviour during loading. Godkänd; 2007; 20071126 (ysko...|$|R

Analyzed together with multiband polarization {{data from the}} literature, probing the Chamaeleon I, Musca, rho Opiuchus, R CrA and Taurus clouds, we show that the wavelength of maximum polarization (lambda_max) is linearly correlated with the radiation environment of the grains. Using Far-Infrared emission data, we show that the large scatter seen in previous studies of lambda_max {{as a function of}} A_V is primarily due to line of sight effects causing some A_V measurements to not be a good tracer of the extinction (radiation field strength) seen by the <b>grains</b> being <b>probed.</b> The derived slopes in lambda_max vs. A_V, for the individual clouds, are consistent with a common value, while the zero intercepts scale with the average values of the ratios of total-to-selective extinction (R_V) for the individual clouds. Within each cloud we do not find direct correlations between lambda_max and R_V. The positive slope in consistent with recent developments in theory and indicating alignment driven by the radiation field. The present data cannot conclusively differentiate between direct radiative torques and alignment driven by H_ 2 formation. However, the small values of lambda_max(A_V= 0), seen in several clouds, suggest a role for the latter, at least at the cloud surfaces. The scatter in the lambda_max vs. A_V relation is found {{to be associated with the}} characteristics of the embedded Young Stellar Objects (YSO) in the clouds. We propose that this is partially due to locally increased plasma damping of the grain rotation caused by X-rays from the YSOs. Comment: Accepted for publication in the Astrophysical Journa...|$|R
2500|$|The first {{unambiguous}} {{consequence of}} the existence of stardust within meteorites came from the laboratory of Edward Anders in Chicago, who found using traditional mass spectrometry that the xenon isotopic abundances contained within an acid-insoluble carbonaceous residue that remained after the meteorite bulk had been dissolved in acids matched almost exactly the predictions for isotopic xenon in red giant stardust. It then seemed certain that stardust grains were contained within Anders' acid-insoluble residue. Finding the actual stardust grains and documenting them was a much harder challenge that required locating the grains and showing that their isotopes matched those within the red-giant star. [...] There followed a decade of intense experimental searching in the attempt to isolate individual grains of those xenon carriers. But what was really needed to discover stardust was a new type of mass spectrometer that could measure the smaller number of atoms in a single <b>grain.</b> Sputtering ion <b>probes</b> were pursued by several laboratories in the attempt to demonstrate such an instrument.

40|$|Ion {{collection}} by dust <b>grains</b> and <b>probes</b> in plasmas with {{a neutral}} background {{is of interest}} in the study of both space and terrestrial plasmas, where charge-exchange collisions can {{play an important role in}} ion collection. Further, background drifts or magnetic fields can significantly affect the ion collection by and the potential structure near such objects, and should therefore also be included. These effects, however, are difficult to include in a theoretical treatment, and thus this problem lends itself to a computational approach. To be able to tackle problems with a neutral background, the 3 D 3 v hybrid particlein- cell code SCEPTIC 3 D has been upgraded to include charge-exchange collisions. This required the development of a new Monte Carlo based reinjection scheme. The new reinjection scheme and other upgrades are described in detail, and the collisionless operation of the reinjection scheme is validated against the old SCEPTIC 3 D reinjection scheme, while its collisional operation is validated through comparisons with the reinjection scheme in SCEPTIC (2 D). The new reinjection scheme can easily be modified to allow the injection of an almost arbitrary distribution function at the domain boundary, enabling future studies of the sensitivity of ion collection to the injected velocity distribution. Studies of ion collection in magnetized or drifting plasmas using the upgraded code extend earlier stationary, unmagnetized results, which showed an enhancement of ion current at intermediate collisionality. It is found that this enhancement is gradually suppressed with increasing background neutral drift speed, and is entirely absent for speeds above the ion sound speed. Adding a magnetic field rather than a neutral drift appears to in fact increase the collisional ion current enhancement. by Christian Bernt Haakonsen. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|AU Microscopii is a 12 Myr old M dwarf that harbors an {{optically}} thin, edge-on disk of dust. The {{scattered light}} surface brightness falls with projected distance b {{from the star}} as b −α; within b = 43 AU, α ≈ 1 – 2, while outside 43 AU, α ≈ 4 – 5. We devise a theory to explain this profile. At a stellocentric distance r = rBR = 43 AU, we posit a ring of parent bodies on circular orbits: the “birth ring, ” wherein micron-sized grains are born from the collisional attrition of parent bodies. The “inner disk ” at r rBR comprises grains just large enough to remain bound to the star, on orbits rendered highly eccentric by stellar wind and radiation pressure. How the vertical optical depth τ ⊥ scales with r depends on the fraction of grains that migrate inward by CPR drag without suffering a collision. If this fraction is large, the inner disk and birth ring share the same optical depth, and τ ⊥ ∝ r − 5 / 2 in the outer disk. By contrast, under collision-dominated conditions, the inner disk is empty, and τ ⊥ ∝ r − 3 / 2 outside. These scaling relations, which we derive analytically and confirm numerically, are robust against uncertainties in the grain size distribution. By simultaneously modeling the surface brightness and thermal spectrum, we break model degeneracies to establish that the AU Mic system is collision-dominated, and that its narrow birth ring contains a lunar mass of decimeter-sized bodies. The inner disk is devoid of micron-sized grains; the surface brightness at b � 43 AU arises from light forward scattered by the birth ring.

40|$|International audienceRecent results {{indicate}} that the grain size and crystallinity inferred from observations of silicate features may be correlated with the spectral type of the central star and/or disk geometry. In this paper, we show that <b>grain</b> size, as <b>probed</b> by the 10 μm silicate feature peak-to-continuum and 11. 3 to 9. 8 μm flux ratios, is inversely proportional to logL*. These trends can be understood using a simple two-layer disk model for passive irradiated flaring disks, CGPLUS. We find that the radius, R 10, of the 10 μm silicate emission zone in the disk goes as (L*/Lsolar) 0. 56, with slight variations depending on disk geometry (flaring angle and inner disk radius). The observed correlations, combined with simulated emission spectra of olivine and pyroxene mixtures, imply a dependence of grain size on luminosity. Combined with the fact that R 10 is smaller for less luminous stars, this implies that the apparent grain size of the emitting dust is larger for low-luminosity sources. In contrast, our models suggest that the crystallinity is only marginally affected, because for increasing luminosity, the zone for thermal annealing (assumed to be at T> 800 K) is enlarged by roughly the same factor as the silicate emission zone. The observed crystallinity is affected by disk geometry, however, with increased crystallinity in flat disks. The apparent crystallinity may also increase with grain growth due to a corresponding increase in contrast between crystalline and amorphous silicate emission bands...|$|R

The experimental design was randomized blocks with four replications. Irrigation was applied by conventional sprinkler system. Soil moisture content from 0. 10 to 1. 0 m was measured by Diviner 2000 <b>probe.</b> <b>Grain</b> yield and water use efficiency were evaluated. During the crop cycle irrigation depth plus rainwater were 692 mm and 491 mm for NWD and WD, respectively, implying in maximum soil water depletions of 26 % (NWD) and 75 % (WD). The water use efficiency was 11. 7 kg. ha- 1. mm- 1 and 4. 6 kg. ha- 1. mm- 1 for NWD and WD, respectively. Under water deficit, the average grain yield was 2, 270 kg. ha-¹, i. e. 72 % lower than no water deficit regime (8, 058 kg. ha-¹). Moreover, 18 hybrids produced above the average, especially the hybrids ALFA 10 (4, 770 kg. ha-¹), 30 A 37 (4, 724 kg. ha-¹) and BX 1200 (4, 562 kg. ha-¹). 201...|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} initial {{results from a}} Spitzer GO- 1 program to obtain low resolution, {{mid-infrared}} spectra of infrared luminous galaxies at z ∼ 1 − 2. This paper presents the spectra of eight sources observed with the Spitzer InfraRed Spectrograph (IRS). Of the eight spectra, six have mid-IR spectral features, either emission from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) or silicate absorption. Based on these mid-IR features, the inferred six redshifts {{are in the range}} of 1. 8 − 2. 6. The remaining two spectra detect only strong continua, thus do not yield redshift information. Strong, multiple PAH emission features are detected in two sources, and weak PAH emission in another two. These data provide direct evidence that PAH molecules are present and directly observable in ULIRGs at z ∼ 2. The six sources with measured redshifts are dusty, infrared luminous galaxies at z ∼ 2 with estimated Lbol ∼ 10 13 L⊙. Of the eight sources, two appear starburst dominated; two with only power law continua are probably type I QSOs; and the remaining four are likely composite systems containing a buried AGN and a starburst component. Since half of our sample are optically faint sources with R ≥ 25. 5 mag (Vega), our results demonstrate the potential of using midinfrared spectroscopy, especially the Aromatic and silicate features produced by dust <b>grains</b> to directly <b>probe</b> optically faint and infrared luminous populations at high redshift.

40|$|Recent results {{indicate}} that the grain size and crystallinity inferred from observations of silicate features may be correlated with spectral type of the central star and/or disk geometry. In this paper, we show that <b>grain</b> size, as <b>probed</b> by the 10 µm silicate feature peak-to-continuum and 11. 3 -to- 9. 8 µm flux ratios, is inversely proportional to log L⋆. These trends can be understood using a simple two-layer disk model for passive irradiated flaring disks, CGPLUS. We find that the radius, R 10, of the 10 µm silicate emission zone in the disk goes as (L⋆/L⊙) 0. 56, with slight variations depending on disk geometry (flaring angle, inner disk radius). The observed correlations, combined with simulated emission spectra of olivine and pyroxene mixtures, imply a grain size dependence on luminosity. Combined with the fact that R 10 is smaller for less luminous stars, this implies that the apparent grain size of the emitting dust is larger for low-luminosity sources. In contrast, our models suggest that the crystallinity is only marginally affected, because for increasing luminosity, the zone for thermal annealing (assumed to be at T> 800 K) is enlarged by roughly the same factor as the silicate emission zone. The observed crystallinity is affected by disk geometry, however, with increased crystallinity in flat disks. The apparent crystallinity may also increase with grain growth due to a corresponding increase in contrast between crystalline and amorphous silicate emission bands.

40|$|I discuss Spitzer GO {{programs}} aimed at studying the mid-IR spectral properties of IR-luminous galaxies at high z. I present the IRS lowresolution, mid-IR spectra of a sample of 52 sources from our GO 1 medium size program. We found that ~ 75 % of the sample are at z ~ 1. 5 − 2. 6, with redshifts determined based on features including PAH emission and silicate absorption in the mid-IR spectra. This dataset revealed the first direct evidence that PAH features are already a significant component of a dusty galaxy's spectrum as early as z = 2. Among the 52 targets, one third are starbursts at z ~ 2 with strong PAH emission, and two thirds are AGN-dominated systems with strong silicate absorption and weak or no PAH emission. The bulk of the sample are dusty, infrared-luminous galaxies at z ~ 1 − 3 with estimated L_(bol) ∼ 10 ^(13) L_☉. At such a high luminosity, a significant fraction of our sample have dust-obscured, strong AGN components. I will discuss the implication for 24 μm-selected, 1 mJy or brighter samples. I also present the ground-based near-IR/optical spectroscopy and 1. 2 mm continuum followup observations of this sample. The Keck spectroscopic redshifts confirm the redshift measurements based on the mid-IR spectra. Since half of our sample are optically faint sources with R ≥ 25. 5 mag (Vega), our results demonstrate the potential of using mid-infrared spectroscopy, especially the aromatic and silicate features produced by dust <b>grains,</b> to directly <b>probe</b> optically faint and infrared-luminous populations at high redshift...|$|R
40|$|Context: The {{quest for}} hot {{dust in the}} central region of debris disks {{requires}} high resolution and high dynamic range imaging. Near-infrared interferometry is a powerful means to directly detect faint emission from hot <b>grains.</b> Aims: We <b>probed</b> the first 3 AU around tau Ceti and eps Eridani with the CHARA array (Mt Wilson, USA) in order to gauge the 2 mum excess flux emanating from possible hot dust grains in the debris disks and to also resolve the stellar photospheres. Methods: High precision visibility amplitude measurements were performed with the FLUOR single mode fiber instrument and telescope pairs on baselines ranging from 22 to 241 m of projected length. The short baseline observations allow us to disentangle the contribution of an extended structure from the photospheric emission, while the long baselines constrain the stellar diameter. Results: We have detected a resolved emission around tau Cet, corresponding to a spatially integrated, fractional excess flux of 0. 98 ± 0. 21 × 10 [SUP]- 2 [/SUP] {{with respect to the}} photospheric flux in the K'-band. Around eps Eri, our measurements can exclude a fractional excess of greater than 0. 6 × 10 [SUP]- 2 [/SUP] (3 sigma). We interpret the photometric excess around tau Cet as a possible signature of hot grains in the inner debris disk and demonstrate that a faint, physical or background, companion can be safely excluded. In addition, we measured both stellar angular diameters with an unprecedented accuracy: Theta_LD(tau Cet) = 2. 015 ± 0. 011 mas and Theta_LD(eps Eri) = 2. 126 ± 0. 014 mas. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Context. The galactic {{anomalous}} microwave emission detected between 10 and 90 GHz {{is a major}} foreground to CMB fluctuations. Well {{correlated to}} dust emission at 100 µm, the anomalous emission is interstellar but its origin is still debated. Some possible explanations relate it to dust: emission of spinning, small (nanometric) grains carrying a permanent electric dipole or magnetic fluctuations in larger (submicronic) <b>grains.</b> Aims. To <b>probe</b> {{the origin of the}} anomalous emission, we compare microwave data to dust IR emission and search for specific signatures predicted by models of spinning dust. Methods. For the anomalous emission, we use the 23 GHz all-sky map deduced from WMAP data by Miville-Deschênes et al. (2008). The dust emission is traced by IRAS data. Models show that spinning dust emission is little sensitive to the intensity of the radiation field (G 0) for 10 �ν� 30 GHz while the corresponding mid-IR emission is proportional to G 0. To test this behaviour in our comparison, we derive G 0 from the dust temperature maps of Schlegel et al. (1998). Results. From all-sky maps, we show that the anomalous emission is better correlated to the emission of small grains (at 12 µm) than to that of big grains (at 100 µm). In addition we show that the former correlation is significantly improved when the 12 µm flux is divided by G 0, as predicted by current models of spinning dust.

40|$|Reduced {{row spacing}} has shown to {{increase}} maize (Zea mays L.) yield; however there are conflicting results on whether narrow rows increases maize crop evapotranspiration and/or water use efficiency. This work analyzes {{the response of}} maize yield, crop evapotranspiration (ET) and water use efficiency to reduced row spacing under different water and N regimes. Maize crops were grown at Balcarce, Argentina, during two seasons. Treatments included two water regimes (rain-fed and irrigated), two rows spacing (35 and 70 cm) and two rates of N (i. e., 180 kg N ha− 1 or nonfertilized). Soil water content was measured through the growing seasons using a neutron <b>probe,</b> <b>grain</b> yield and shoot dry matter were determined at physiological maturity. Grain yield response to narrow rows ranged from 0 to 23 %; it was higher for water limited (i. e., rain-fed crops) and/or N deficient crops (i. e., nonfertilized crops) and lower for crops with high N fertilization and irrigation. Narrow rows consistently increased (8 %) crop ET during {{the initial stages of}} crop growth; and N fertilization did not influence ET response to reduced row spacing during this period. Initial differences in ET between row spacing treatments were diluted as the season progressed, and seasonal crop ET was not influenced by row spacing. Reduced row spacing increased water use efficiency for grain production up to 17 %; increments were larger in N deficient crops and/or with water limitations but were negligible in N fertilized and irrigated crops.

40|$|Atom probe {{tomography}} is a {{high resolution}} microscopy technique capable of determining the 3 D location and chemical identification of individual atoms within a specimen. Though it is becoming ever more popular, {{a number of issues}} with the technique are known. First, the large amount of data created by atom probe tomography experiments requires new techniques to be developed so as to conduct effective analysis. Also, atom probe tomography is not traditionally considered a tool for crystallographic analysis even though crystallographic information is known to be present in reconstructed datasets. Though prior work has been done, the field of atom probe crystallography is underdeveloped. Furthermore, artefacts in the atom probe experiment and reconstruction are complicated and influence the resulting tomograms in subtle ways. The effects of these artefacts need to be understood so as to properly interpret atom probe results. This thesis contains seven manuscripts which discuss these issues. First, three manuscripts are presented which outline the development 3 D orientation mapping of crystal <b>grains</b> in atom <b>probe</b> data, current computational approaches to atom probe data and a new framework for conducting crystallographic analysis of atom probe data. A fourth paper is presented which outlines and applies a new method to define and extract grain boundaries in atom probe datasets. Two papers are presented which discuss artefacts present in atom probe data, how they influence reconstructions and how to minimise errors resulting from these artefacts. A final manuscript is presented which applies several of the developed techniques to the analysis of the aerospace alloy, AA 2198. Here, the microstructural evolution of AA 2198 is characterised with particular emphasis on the strengthening T 1 phase. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} a ruminal probe for recording diurnal variation in rumen pH, we fitted three ruminally fis-tulated cows with probes {{affixed to the}} inside of the cannula. Probes were connected to a data logger and readings were recorded hourly. The experiment was a Latin square design with cows fed three different diets: 50, 60, and 70 % grain as a total mixed rations once daily. Feed offerings and refusals were recorded daily. The experimental period was 21 d. The first 6 d were for adaptation, followed by 5 -d rotations through each of the diets. Daily probe readings were recorded at 4 -, 6 -, 8 -, 12 -, and 24 -h intervals. At each interval, readings were recorded (precleaned), a sample of ru-men fluid was taken, and pH was measured in the laboratory. As probes were removed from the rumen, probe ends were cleaned with 0. 1 N HCl and reinserted into the rumen, and a reading was recorded (post-cleaned). No protective pH probe shields were used in this experiment. There were no differences between pre- and postcleaned pH readings across cows for all diets. Mean time under pH 5. 0, 5. 5, and 6. 0 were 0. 2, 2, and 7. 2 h, respectively. Diet affected length of time under a certain pH, only for readings under pH 6. Diurnal pH profiles were monophasic in nature. The degree of acidity increased after feeding and duration of nadir increased with increasing grain in the diet. Daily DMI increased but was highly variable within the first week after switching to the next higher grain level. These results indicate the use of an indwelling ruminal probe without a protective shield, cleaned, and calibrated daily can accurately measure diurnal variation of ruminal pH. In addition, transition to higher grain levels in the diet increases pH, duration of pH nadir, and daily DMI fluctuation.
