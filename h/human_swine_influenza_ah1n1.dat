40|$|Most {{experimental}} studies of epistasis in evolution have focused on adaptive changes-but adaptation accounts for {{only a portion of}} total evolutionary change. Are the patterns of epistasis during adaptation representative of evolution more broadly? We address this question by examining a pair of protein homologs, of which only one is subject to a well-defined pressure for adaptive change. Specifically, we compare the nucleoproteins from <b>human</b> and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza.</b> <b>Human</b> influenza is under continual selection to evade recognition by acquired immune memory, while <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> experiences less such selection {{due to the fact that}} pigs are less likely to be infected with influenza repeatedly in a lifetime. Mutations in some types of immune epitopes are therefore much more strongly adaptive to <b>human</b> than <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> [...] here we focus on epitopes targeted by human cytotoxic T lymphocytes. The nucleoproteins of <b>human</b> and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> possess nearly identical numbers of such epitopes. However, mutations in these epitopes are fixed significantly more frequently in <b>human</b> than in <b>swine</b> <b>influenza,</b> presumably because these epitope mutations are adaptive only to human influenza. Experimentally, we find that epistatically constrained mutations are fixed only in the adaptively evolving human influenza lineage, where they occur at sites that are enriched in epitopes. Overall, our results demonstrate that epistatically interacting substitutions are enriched during adaptation, suggesting that the prevalence of epistasis is dependent on the underlying evolutionary forces at play...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY: Antigenic {{comparisons}} of six strains of <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> virus with three strains of human influenza A virus {{were made by}} the agglutination-inhibition tech-nique. The strains were also compared in regard to inhibition by normal sera, rate of elution from red cells, pathogenicity for mice, and other properties. All swine strains were significantly different from human strains. Four American swine strains formed a fairly homogeneous group, but were less closely related to two strains recovered in the United Kingdom. The hdings are briefly discussed in terms of the relation-ship between <b>human</b> and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza,</b> <b>Human</b> influenza A viruses recovered from succeeding epidemics exhibit varying degrees of difference in antigenic structure. In order to ascertain whether this occurred among strains of <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> virus, the antigenic structure of standard strains of <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> virus was compared with that of some more recently isolated strains. The earliest work on this subject was carried out by Shope (1935 - 6, 1936, 1937 a, b, 1988) in his extensive researches on <b>swine</b> <b>influenza,</b> Following studies on immunological and serological relationships between <b>swine</b> and <b>human</b> viruses, Shope concluded in agreement with Laidlaw (1985) that <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> might well have had its origin from the 1918 - 19 human influenza pandemic virus. Isolation of strains of <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> in the British Isles (Lamont, 1938; Blakemore & Gledhill, 1941) was followed by a survey of the antigenic re-lationship of British <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> strains to standard <b>human</b> and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> viruses by means of the agglutination-inhibition tests with chicken and ferret antisera by Hudson, Sigel & Markham (1948) and by Glover & Andrewes (1948). Since then, however, methods have been evolved for the destruction of non-specific inhibitor in normal sera, and serological relation-ships, as indicated by haemagglutination-inhibition tests, can now be more clearly demonstrated. It is interesting to review the relationship between <b>human</b> and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> viruses in the light of recent techniques...|$|R

Humans with acute infection {{might also be}} a source of infection for swine production units. This article describes the study design and methods being used to assess influenza A transmission between swine workers and pigs. We hypothesize that transmission of <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> viruses to <b>humans,</b> transmission of <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> viruses to <b>swine,</b> and reassortment of <b>human</b> and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> A viruses is occurring. The project is part of a Team Grant; all Team Grant studies include active surveillance for <b>influenza</b> among Hutterite <b>swine</b> farmers in Alberta, Canada. This project also includes non-Hutterite swine farms that are experiencing swine respiratory illness. Methods/Design Nurses conduct active surveillance for influenza-like-illness (ILI), visiting participating communally owned and operated Hutterite swine farms twice weekly. Nasopharyngeal swabs and acute and convalescent sera are obtained from persons with any two such symptoms. Swabs are tested for influenza A and B by a real time RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction) at the Alberta Provincial Laboratory for Public Health (ProvLab). Test-positive participants are advised that they have influenza. The occurrence of test-positive swine workers triggers sampling (swabbing, acute and convalescent serology) of the swine herd by veterinarians. Specimens obtained from swine are couriered to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN for testing. Veterinarians and herd owners are notified if animal specimens are test-positive for <b>influenza.</b> If <b>swine</b> ILI occurs, veterinarians obtain samples from the pigs; test-positives from the animals trigger nurses to obtain specimens (swabbing, acute and convalescent serology) from the swine workers. ProvLab cultures influenza virus from human specimens, freezes these cultures and human sera, and ships them to St. Jude where sera will be examined for antibodies to <b>swine</b> and <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> virus strains or reassortants. Full length sequencing of all eight genes from the <b>human</b> and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> isolates will be performed so that detailed comparisons can be performed between them.

40|$|The NP, PA, PB 1, and PB 2 {{proteins}} {{of influenza}} viruses together {{are responsible for}} the transcription and replication of viral RNA, and the latter three proteins comprise the viral polymerase.

The objective of this study was to analyze the co-mutated sites within and between these important proteins of influenza. With mutual information, a set of statistically significant co- mutated position pairs (P value = 0) in NP, PA, PB 1, and PB 2 of avian, human, pandemic 2009 H 1 N 1, and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> were identified, based on which several highly connected networks of correlated sites in NP, PA, PB 1, and PB 2 were discovered.

Mutual information was also applied to quantify the correlation of sites within each individual protein and between proteins. In general, the inter protein correlation of the four proteins was stronger than the intra protein correlation.

40|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of 52 published and 37 new nucleoprotein (NP) gene sequences addressed the evolution and origin of <b>human</b> and <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> A viruses. H 1 N 1 <b>human</b> and classical <b>swine</b> viruses (i. e., {{those related to}} Swine/Iowa/ 15 / 30) share a single common ancestor, which was estimated to have occurred in 1912 to 1913. From this common ancestor, <b>human</b> and classical <b>swine</b> virus NP genes have evolved at similar rates that are higher than in avian virus NP genes (3. 31 to 3. 41 versus 1. 90 nucleotide changes per year). At the protein level, human virus NPs have evolved {{twice as fast as}} classical swine virus NPs (0. 66 versus 0. 34 amino acid change per year). Despite evidence of frequent interspecies transmission of <b>human</b> and classical <b>swine</b> viruses, our analysis indicates that these viruses have evolved independently since well before the first isolates in the early 1930 s. Although our analysis cannot reveal the original host, the ancestor virus was avianlike, showing only five amino acid differences from the root of the avian virus NP lineage. The common pattern of relationship and origin for the NP and other genes of H 1 N 1 <b>human</b> and classical <b>swine</b> viruses suggests that the common ancestor was an avian virus and not a reassortant derived from previous <b>human</b> or <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> A viruses. The new avianlike H 1 N 1 swine viruses in Europe may provide a model for the evolution of newly introduced avian viruses into the swine host reservoir. The NPs of these viruses are evolving more rapidly than those of <b>human</b> or classical <b>swine</b> viruses (4. 50 nucleotide changes and 0. 74 amino acid change per year), and when these rates are applied to pre- 1930 s <b>human</b> and classical <b>swine</b> virus NPs, the predicted date of a common ancestor is 1918 rather than 1912 to 1913. Thus, our NP phylogeny is consistent with historical records and the proposal that a short time before 1918, a new H 1 N 1 avianlike virus entered <b>human</b> or <b>swine</b> hosts (O. T. Gorman, R. O. Donis, Y. Kawaoka, and R. G. Webster, J. Virol. 64 : 4893 - 4902, 1990). This virus provided the ancestors of all known human influenza A virus genes, except for HA, NA, and PB 1, which have since been reassorted from avian viruses. We propose that during 1918 a virulent strain of this new avianlike virus caused a severe human influenza pandemic and that the pandemic virus was introduced into North American swine populations, constituting the origin of classical swine virus...|$|R

It seemed possible that the cross-immunological relationship between <b>swine</b> and <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> virus found in the simple virus infections of ferrets and mice might not follow in the complex virus-bacterium infections necessary to induce <b>influenza</b> in <b>swine.</b> The present paper reports experiments dealing with the cross-immunization of swine by means of initial infections with either <b>swine</b> or <b>human</b> <b>influenza</b> virus alone or in mixture with the bacterium, H. influenzae suis...|$|R
25|$|The 1918 flu {{pandemic}} in humans {{was associated with}} H1N1 and influenza appearing in pigs; this may reflect a zoonosis either from <b>swine</b> to <b>humans,</b> or from <b>humans</b> to <b>swine.</b> Although it is not certain in which direction the virus was transferred, some evidence suggests, in this case, pigs caught the disease from <b>humans.</b> For instance, <b>swine</b> <b>influenza</b> was only noted as a new disease of pigs in 1918, after the first large outbreaks of influenza amongst people. Although a recent phylogenetic analysis of more recent strains of influenza in humans, birds, animals, and many others and swine suggests the 1918 outbreak in humans followed a reassortment event within a mammal, the exact origin of the 1918 strain remains elusive. It is estimated that anywhere from 50 to 100million people were killed worldwide.|$|R
