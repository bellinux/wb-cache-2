40|$|Basal laminas are {{important}} sheets of specialized extracellular matrix that underlie and surround <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> such as epithelia or endothelia, enabling the cells to orientate their basal/apical polarity {{and creating a}} microenvironment for them. Basal laminas can also individually encapsulate whole cells, such as muscle cells, thereby forming a microenvironment but not polarizing the enclosed cells. Other mesenchymal or stromal cells exist with no basal lamina. In the course of studying the bovine follicular basal lamina which underlies the multilayered epithelium of the ovarian follicle, we identified a developmentally regulated novel extracellular matrix (which we call focimatrix for focal intra-epithelial matrix). Focimatrix is composed of basal lamina-like material deposited as plaques or aggregates between the multilayers of the epithelial granulosa cells. The focimatrix does not <b>encapsulate</b> individual or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> and therefore does not form a microenvironment for them. Focimatrix contains collagen type IV subunits α 1 and α 2 (but not α 3 –α 6), and laminin chains α 1, β 2 and γ 1 (but not α 2 or β 1), and nidogen- 1 and perlecan (but not versican). The amount of focimatrix increases with increasing follicular size, and its appearance precedes the expression by granulosa <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> the enzymes for steroid hormone synthesis, cholesterol side-chain cleavage cytochrome P 450 (SCC) and 3 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 β-HSD), in the days preceding ovulation. The expression in granulosa <b>cells</b> <b>of</b> two components examined, nidogen- 1 and perlecan, also increases substantially when follicles enlarge to a sufficient size capable of ovulating. Following ovulation the follicular basal lamina is degraded, and presumably focimatrix is too since it is not detected in corpora lutea that develop from the ovulating follicles. During this development the granulosa cells undergo an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) into luteal cells following ovulation, and substantially increase their expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the process. During EMT epithelial cells lose polarity. Since focimatrix exists {{on more than one}} side <b>of</b> the granulosa <b>cells,</b> we propose that it disrupts the polarity induced by the follicular basal lamina in the lead up to ovulation. Hence focimatrix maybe {{a key part of the}} follicular/luteal EMT. Helen F. Irving-Rodgers, M. Lyn Harland and Raymond J. Rodgers[URL]...|$|R

40|$|Current {{middleware}} solutions such as CORBA and Java's RMI emphasize compositional {{design by}} separating functional {{aspects of a}} system (e. g. objects) i~om the mechanisms used for interaction (e. g. remote procedure call through stubs and skeletons). While this is an effective solution for handling distributed interactions, higher-level requirements such as heterogeneity, availability, and adaptability require policies for resource management as well as interaction. We describe the Distributed Connection Language (DCL) : an architecture description language based on the Actor model of distributed objects. System components and the policies which govern an architecture are specified as <b>encapsulated</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> actors. Composition operators are used to build connections between components as well as customize their behavior. This customization is realized using a metaarchitecture. We describe the syntax and semantics of DCL, and illustrate the language by way of several examples. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Previously used {{methods of}} {{comparing}} am-perometric spike characteristics from two separate <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> have entailed pooling all the values for a spike characteristic from each <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells</b> and then statistically comparing the two samples. Although {{this approach has}} indicated that there are significant differ-ences between the spike characteristics from coloboma and control mouse chromaffin cells, the results are not consistent between experiments. We have reexamined the assumptions of the statistical tests used {{as well as the}} variability inherent in amperometric data measured from two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells.</b> Our findings indicate that when comparing amperometric spike characteristics between <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>cells,</b> it is more appropriate to compare sam-ples of mean spike values. This method consistently in-dicates that there is no difference between coloboma and control amperometric spikes. These results have been validated by using samples of mean spike characteristics to detect changes in the shape of amperometric spikes from both mouse chromaffin cells at 37 °C and PC 12 cells previously exposed to 50 mM L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylala-nine and by the use of an additional analysis method, the nested ANOVA. Together, these results indicate that pooled samples of amperometric spike characteristics can give results that may confound the interpretation of amperometric data.
