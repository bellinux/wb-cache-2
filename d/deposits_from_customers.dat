40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} two most recent crises {{affecting}} the Norwegian banking system, namely the Norwegian banking crisis from 1988 to 1993 and the recent financial crisis reaching Norwegian markets in 2008. Although the financial crisis was a global phenomenon and originated from the US mortgage market, my main {{focus will be on}} the Norwegian system and how it was affected by the spillovers from international markets. Chapters 2 and 3 provide a presentation of the two crises and chapter 4 compares them in some key respects. Even though every banking crisis has some unique characteristics, there also exist several fundamental similarities. Banks, through their organization, are exposed to external shocks affecting market risks, the capitalization of firms and consumers, and aggregate investment. The main task of a commercial bank is to act as a financial intermediary, transforming <b>deposits</b> <b>from</b> <b>customers</b> and funding by outside investors into loans and further investments. Profits are generated from earning a higher interest or return on the loans and investments than what is demanded by depositors and investors. An unregulated, profit maximizing bank will try to expand its activity as much as possible in proportion to its own capital. Loans are often long-term and considered less liquid than deposits. This maturity-mismatch between investments and funding is an important source of risk to a bank since the premature liquidation of assets is likely to drive down their prices. Falling asset prices can cause a bank to become illiquid and eventually insolvent. Being liquid means that the bank at all times possesses legal tender to service transactions, like withdrawals, while solvency means that the value of the bank’s assets exceeds the value of the bank’s liabilities excluding own capital. When a bank is suffering from decreasing asset values due to for example an increasing number of defaults on its loans, solvency is upheld by the share of a banks capital that can be written down as compensation, for example stocks, but obviously not deposits. Prior to both crises, banks kept only small levels of capital relative to their operations. Investments were largely funded by relatively cheap short-term debt which can be difficult to refinance in a recession. While such a strategy is capable of boosting earnings during periods of strong economic growth, it will also increase risk exposure and thus likely contribute to larger financial problems during a recession. In other words, a short-term profit maximizing strategy will increase the impact of fluctuations in the business-cycle on the banking system and the real economy, and can be referred to as pro-cyclical banking. Chapter 5 introduces a model by Holmström and Tirole from 1997 which shows how moral hazard creates a need for intermediaries in the financial system. Banks can monitor investments through repeated transactions with their borrowers and can make the arrangement efficient by exploiting economies of scale. The monitoring alleviates the moral hazard problem. Individual investors are assumed to find monitoring to be too expensive to undertake themselves. Banks can therefore profit on financing a market share of firms considered too risky or opaque by individual, uninformed investors. Within this framework, the authors illustrate how the volume of credit and capital in the system affect investment, financial intermediaries and regular firms. Since the model was designed in the time period between the two crises in question and was partly inspired by the Norwegian banking crisis, I will test its explanatory powers on recent events. The thesis will, {{in the light of the}} two banking crises, examine how pro-cyclical banking affects the availability of credit in the market and how this in turn affects firms dependent on debt financing from banks. I will also look at how the business cycle affects banks’ lending behavior and their approach to risk. By looking at {{the two most}} recent crises to the Norwegian banking system, I will point to similarities and differences. Unregulated banks are under pressure to offer its investors and shareholders with a competitive rate of return. If the whole system gravitates towards maximizing short-term profits at potentially high future risk of default, then the banking system is in a bad equilibrium in the sense that longevity and a stable credit supply is undermined. There has been clear progress in the way Norwegian banks operate since the Norwegian banking crisis. Improved regulation and higher capital levels have rendered the banking system more robust against external shocks. Still government intervention to restore system liquidity was required during the recent crisis. Internationally, there has also been an increased use of financial innovation, with the effect of banks moving risky assets off their balance sheets, enabling them become highly leveraged despite regulation. I therefore feel that a thesis questioning certain fundamental, possibly destabilizing aspects of banking is very relevant in light of the recent financial crisis...|$|E
50|$|The third {{contributor}} to RBS's problems was its liquidity position. From a position around 2002 where {{the bank was}} essentially 'fully funded' (i.e. was funding its lending positions fully <b>from</b> <b>deposits</b> gathered <b>from</b> <b>customers),</b> the rapid growth in lending within the GBM (Global Banking and Markets) division led to a reliance on external wholesale funding. The combination of this, along with the weak equity capital position, and the massive exposure to losses on CDOs via Greenwich, were the factors that destroyed RBS. The bank experienced severe financial problems, and attempted to shore up its balance sheet with a £12 billion share issue in April 2008, {{one of the largest}} in UK corporate history. The attempt to raise an additional £7 billion capital by selling off insurers Churchill and Direct Line failed due to lack of interest in the context of the global liquidity crisis. RBS was forced in October 2008 to rely on a UK Government bank rescue package to support a shareholder recapitalisation of the bank, which resulted in the government owning a majority of the shares. Following two rights issues in 2008, Goodwin resigned as Chief Executive.|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 51). BRAC Bank Limited {{is one of the}} latest generations of scheduled commercial banks in Bangladesh. It was founded in Bangladesh under the Banking Companies Act, 1991 and incorporated as private limited company on 20 May 1999 under the Companies Act, 1994. BRAC Bank Limited started its Journey on the 4 th of July 2001 with a vision to be the absolute market leader through providing the entire range of banking services suitable to the needs of modern and dynamic banking business as well as to promote broad based participation in the Bangladesh economy through the provision of high quality banking services. BRAC Bank Limited, with institutional share holdings by BRAC and International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been the fastest growing Bank in 2004 and 2005. BRAC Bank is extending full range of banking facilities as per the directives of Bangladesh Bank. It intends to set standards as the absolute market leader in Bangladesh by providing efficient, friendly and modern fully automated on-line service on a profitable basis. As a leading SME based bank BRAC Bank is to maintain large portfolio. It also follows & maintains Bangladesh Bank’s regulation and instruction to continue its daily operations. Treasury & FI Operations plays a vital role in this context. SLR stands for Statutory Liquidity Reserve, which is maintaining 19 % of bank’s Average Total Demand and Time Liability with Central Bank. It means of each 100 Taka <b>deposit</b> <b>from</b> <b>customers</b> we have to keep 19 Taka as SLR and we have to maintain it by mixing different portfolio instruments following Central bank directives. Of 19 % SLR requirement, 5. 5 % is CRR or Cash Reserve Ratio for daily requirement & 6 % average for fortnightly mandatory requirement. SLR can be maintained with Treasury Bills, Treasury Bonds, Foreign Currency Balance with Central Bank, Cash balance in hand, Cash balance with Sonali Bank - agent of Central Bank and CRR is maintained with cash balance with Central Bank. SLR has direct correlation with Asset Liability Management (ALM) of Bank. ALM monitors, measures and manages the risks associated with balance sheet and guard the bank against any unforeseen loss or threat of survival. Now, the question should come how SLR & ALM has the linked up. It is nothing but the tools of Central Bank by fix the standard AD Ratio. AD ratio means advance to deposit ratio. It helps to judge bank’s liquidity position. In ideal scenario, AD ratio should be around 81 %, as 19 % of deposit is maintained as SLR. AD ratio might also go above 81 % considering bank’s capital, deposit base, contingency liquidity support window and overall depth of money market etc. At present, Standard AD Ratio is 85 % for Bank set by Central Bank. Treasury, to comply all the above regulatory factors, is performing their day to day task which is nothing but the goal of every organization - making money by minimizing risks. That’s why; they are called the heart of every bank like Bank is treated as the life-blood of the modern economy. Treasury is the bank’s fund manager and they are the prime profit center of every bank. The dimension of the department is they are dealing simultaneously in the Money Market, Capital Market, Securities market as well as Foreign Exchange Market. And, most importantly, the Head of Treasury of every bank is the Chairman of ALCO (Asset Liability Committee).
