5|$|Because the South Korean {{forces had}} {{suffered}} nearly 45,000 casualties {{at the end}} of 1950, most of the South Korean units were composed of raw recruits with little combat training. After <b>inspecting</b> the front just days before the battle, General J. Lawton Collins, the US Army Chief of Staff, concluded that most of the ROK formations were only fit for outpost duties. At the same time, the US Eighth Army was also suffering from low morale due to its earlier defeats, and most of its soldiers were anticipating an evacuation from Korea. The Eighth Army's lack of will to fight and to maintain contact with Chinese forces resulted in a lack of information on Chinese troop movements and intentions. After <b>inspecting</b> the front on December 27, Ridgway ordered the US I and IX Corps to organize a new defensive line around Koyang to Uijeongbu, called the Seoul Bridgehead line, to cover the Han River crossings in case the UN forces were forced to evacuate Seoul.|$|E

40|$|With the {{creation}} of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), audit firm oversight shifted away from self-regulation to independent regulation. The inspections program is the central feature of the PCAOB. We examine whether PCAOB inspections are able to distinguish actual audit quality (as opposed to perceived) during the period <b>inspected</b> to better understand this important regulatory tool. We use three measures that proxy for actual audit quality: abnormal accruals, restatements, and the propensity to issue a going concern opinion. For triennially <b>inspected</b> auditors, we find that PCAOB inspections are associated with lower audit quality when the reports are seriously deficient (weaker results for deficient reports). More specifically, we find clients of triennially <b>inspected</b> auditors that receive a deficient or seriously deficient report are associated with significantly higher abnormal current accruals and clients of auditors that receive a seriously deficient report are associated with a greater propensity to restate. Our evidence is subject to the caveat that PCAOB reports for triennially <b>inspected</b> auditors do not capture the going concern aspect of audit quality. For annually <b>inspected</b> auditors, the results are conflicting and suggest PCAOB inspection reports do not distinguish audit quality during the period <b>inspected</b> for annually <b>inspected</b> auditors...|$|R
