5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasm. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in <b>Dermatology</b> Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} about how to classify the severity of psoriasis. Mild psoriasis {{has been defined as}} a percentage of body surface area (BSA)≤10, a Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) score ≤10, and a <b>dermatology</b> life quality index (DLQI) score ≤10. Moderate to severe psoriasis was defined by the same group as BSA >10 or PASI score >10 and a DLQI score >10. The DLQI is a 10 question tool used to measure the impact of several dermatologic diseases on daily functioning. The DLQI score ranges from 0 (minimal impairment) to 30 (maximal impairment) and is calculated with each answer being assigned 0–3 points with higher scores indicating greater social or occupational impairment.|$|E
5|$|HIStory was {{promoted}} with the successful HIStory World Tour, beginning on September 7, 1996, and ending on October 15, 1997.

During the tour, Jackson married his longtime friend Deborah Jeanne Rowe, a <b>dermatology</b> nurse, in an impromptu ceremony in Sydney, Australia. Rowe was approximately six months pregnant with the couple's first child at the time. Originally, Rowe and Jackson {{had no plans to}} marry, but Jackson's mother Katherine persuaded them to do so. Michael Joseph Jackson Jr (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997; his sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born a year later on April 3, 1998. The couple divorced in 1999, and Jackson received full custody of the children. The divorce was relatively amicable, but a subsequent custody suit was not settled until 2006.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of <b>Dermatology.</b> erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen had described in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint {{on the wall of}} the Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room and is going to punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the <b>dermatology</b> clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E

25|$|The medical {{literature}} {{has been struggling}} to control the proliferation of acronyms as their use has evolved from aiding communication to hindering it.

25|$|Other {{areas of}} {{research}} at the Center include: Gastroenterology, Cardiology, Pulmonology, Allergy, Endocrinology, Nephrology, Hemato-oncology, Hepato-oncology, Infection, Rheumatology, Orthopedics, General Surgery, Plastic Surgery, Thoracic Surgery, Neurosurgery, Obstetrics & Gynecology, ENT, Family Medicine, Rehabilitation Medicine, Pediatrics, Anesthesiology, <b>Dermatology,</b> Neurology, Psychiatry, Diagnostics, Pathology, Radiology, Radiological Oncology, Ophthalmology, Urology, Nuclear Medicine.|$|E
25|$|A basic {{reference}} chart used {{for consumers to}} spot suspicious moles {{is found in the}} mnemonic A-B-C-D, used by institutions such as the American Academy of <b>Dermatology</b> and the National Cancer Institute. The letters stand for asymmetry, border, color, and diameter. Sometimes, the letter E (for elevation or evolving) is added. According to the American Academy of <b>Dermatology,</b> if a mole starts changing in size, color, shape or, especially, if the border of a mole develops ragged edges or becomes larger than a pencil eraser, it would be an appropriate time to consult with a physician. Other warning signs include a mole, even if smaller than a pencil eraser, that is different from the others and begins to crust over, bleed, itch, or become inflamed. The changes may indicate developing melanomas. The matter can become clinically complicated because mole removal depends on which types of cancer, if any, come into suspicion.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the success}} of these results, a 2-year {{clinical}} trial was conducted to monitor contamination levels of nosocomial bacteria in the <b>dermatology</b> ward and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Kitasato University Hospital. The antimicrobial efficiency of copper on floors, sinks, push plates, showerheads and doorknobs was evaluated by comparing bacterial loads on these surfaces and on their non-copper counterparts.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms {{will include}} swelling, edema, and pain from a {{multitude}} of secondary complications (pressure, musculoskeletal disorder from asymmetry, restricted blood flow). Most patients will avoid discussing pain for many reasons, so this will require logical thinking or communication skills to assess. In advanced lymphedema, there may be the presence of skin changes such as discoloration, verrucous (wart-like) hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and Ulcer (<b>dermatology).</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1958, <b>dermatology</b> {{professor}} Aaron B.

25|$|When {{a copper}} plate was {{situated}} on a MRSA-infected {{floor in the}} <b>dermatology</b> ward around a bed of a MRSA-infected patient, the bacterial count of S. aureus, including MRSA and the other Staphylococcus on the floor covered with a copper plate was significantly less than on a floor unprotected by copper alloys. These results suggested that the copper plate helped {{to prevent the spread}} of MRSA contamination in the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Female {{androgenic}} alopecia {{has become}} a growing problem that, according to the American Academy of <b>Dermatology,</b> affects around 30million women in the United States. Although hair loss in females normally occurs {{after the age of}} 50 or even later when it does not follow events like pregnancy, chronic illness, crash diets, and stress among others, it is now occurring at earlier ages with reported cases in women as young as 15 or 16.|$|E
25|$|According to the American Academy of <b>Dermatology,</b> {{the most}} common types of moles are skin tags, raised moles and flat moles. Benign moles are usually brown, tan, pink or black (especially on dark-colored skin). They are {{circular}} or oval and are usually small (commonly between 1–3mm), though some can be larger than {{the size of a}} typical pencil eraser (>5mm). Some moles produce dark, coarse hair. Common mole hair removal procedures include plucking, cosmetic waxing, electrolysis, threading and cauterization.|$|E
