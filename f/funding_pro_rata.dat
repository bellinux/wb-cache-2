40|$|Australian-origin {{insect pests}} {{threaten}} the productivity and sustainability of eucalypt plantations worldwide. New pests {{such as the}} bronze bug (Thaumastocoris peregrinus), two gall wasps (Leptocybe invasa and Ophelimus maskelli) and the lerp psyllid (Glycaspis brimblecombei) have emerged as key global pests, while longer-established pests such as the eucalyptus snout beetle (Gonipterus spp. complex) are re-emerging as signifi cant issues. The speed at which these pests have emerged, invaded, andspread globally has taxed industry’s ability to manage them effectively. Global issues such as these require global solutions. The Biological Control of Eucalypt Pest Research Alliance (BiCEP) {{has been established in}} Australia to provide a focus for developing biological control solutions for key eucalypt pests. BiCEP is funded by eucalypt plantation industry partners and delivers the research and development required to underpin effective biological control of pests in three categories of need: discovery (peststhat do not have known effective biocontrol agents), application (pests with known but not yet established or evaluated biocontrol agents), and fi ne-tuning (pests that have established biocontrol agents but which require better climate/host matching). BiCEP is <b>funded</b> <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> on area of partner’s plantations. Examples of research in these categories will be outlined...|$|R
500|$|The United States was {{represented}} by Mark R. Freeman, Assistant to the Solicitor General. [...] Freeman argued that Congress had placed a cap on IDEAA contract funds beginning in 1994, and the BIA {{did not have the}} authority to spend more than the capped amount on all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] Due to the lack of sufficient funding, the Secretary of the Interior has distributed the available <b>funds</b> on a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> basis among all of the IDEAA contracts. [...] The United States also pointed out that the Constitution prohibits payments unless those payments have been appropriated or authorized by Congress. [...] Freeman argued that the government's liability does not extend past {{the amount of money that}} Congress has appropriated for all of the contracts. [...] The government also stated that the contract did not create a binding promise to pay the tribes the full amount of the contract.|$|R
40|$|Much {{specialist}} {{palliative care}} in the U. K. is provided through the voluntary sector, with funding {{in part from the}} National Health Service and the remainder from donations. Service development has been ad hoc to date. In Wales, with a population of just under three million, the Minister has allocated specific ring fenced funding for the voluntary sector, to ensure that there is equity of evidence-based care provision. To do this, a formula has been developed to meet the specialist palliative care needs across Wales, appropriate to both urban and rural settings, for populations of all ages and {{to take into account the}} requirements for hospital support teams and those working in cancer centers. In addition, where hospice inpatient beds exist, a funding formula has been developed to guide reimbursement for basic care costs. Where there are no beds, hospice-at-home provision provides an alternative model of care, with <b>funding</b> adjusted <b>pro</b> <b>rata.</b> The formula aims to ensure fairness of specialist palliative care provision, available out of hours as well as during the working day, providing patient-focused evidence-based care. This means that the specialist team must meet specialist education standards, act as a resource to generalist teams and use a core clinical data set to allow comparable audits against agreed all-Wales standards...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to give some {{comments}} on two approximations used to price rein-statements related to excess of loss reinsurance.

3000|$|The fifth {{equation}} treats principal prioritization. The equation {{requires the}} additional parameters α and β _ΔTS,M. It was constructed {{so that the}} first part of the equation is the same as the equation for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> case. Thus, the two additional terms in the equation for principal prioritization versus the equation for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> case determine whether the resulting levered equity beta is greater, less than or equal to the levered equity beta for the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> distribution, when equal inputs are used. As was mentioned earlier, β _ΔTS,M> 0 is a reasonable assumption for principal prioritization. Furthermore, for a positive risk-free rate the term τ×D/S×([...] r^c/R^c - α×r^c - r^f/R^f) is always positive. Assuming that β _U,M>β _D,M, makes the two additional terms positive. This leads to a levered equity beta that is greater than the one under the assumption of a <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> distribution.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Currently, the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> {{method is}} widely used to price policy {{extensions}} and other changes to policy length. However, {{there are several other}} methods that an actuary can use in pricing policy-length changes, such as option and forward pricing, or modeling. There is little discussion in the literature about the relative merits of these different methods, leaving the pricing actuary potentially unsure of which method to use in a given situation. This paper seeks to resolve some of that ambiguity by identifying the features of a contract that would indicate the need to select a certain method over others. The goal of this discussion is to provide the pricing actuary with a framework {{that can be used to}} select the most appropriate method for the particular contract that is being priced. The paper then provides simple examples of how these methods might be applied in different situations. Finally, it compares the results obtained using the recommended method to the results from the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method, and points out the potential for pricing insufficiencies when the <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method is applied universally. These results should encourage the reader to consider pricing techniques aside from the standard <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> method...|$|R

40|$|Environmental {{contamination}} often causes {{injuries that}} occur {{over long periods}} of time. These “long-tail” injuries, which tend to span periods during which a liable party was covered by multiple insurers, do not map neatly onto standard indemnification insurance policies. As a result, liable parties and their insurers frequently engage in protracted litigation to minimize the portion that they must contribute to environmental remediation projects. In Boston Gas Co. v. Century Indemnity, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit upheld an application of Massachusetts’s recently announced <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment rule, which greatly reduced the insurer’s liability. Proponents of <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment argue that it lessens the burden that indemnification litigation puts on court dockets and that it promotes environmentally conscientious business practices. This Comment challenges those claims and argues that <b>pro</b> <b>rata</b> apportionment may actually undermine environmental remediation projects by limiting the amount of private resources available for them...|$|R
