The in-car presentation of route guiding advices may distract a driver from his tasks to keep course and {{to account for}} the other traffic and the traffic environment. A distraction by route guiding pictogrammes from the task to keep course can be avoided by selecting pictogrammes that require a shorter interpretation time than the available time period between two successive course corrections. In a laboratory study on the distraction from the task {{to account for the}} other traffic, it was found that <b>deteriorations</b> mainly occurred in incident situations. The <b>deteriorations</b> are largest for stimuli from a location {{right in front of the}} car, especially for elder drivers.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we use a}} {{data-driven}} (DD) rule-based method for modeling pronunciation variation. Error analysis is performed {{in order to gain}} insight into the effect of pronunciation variation modeling. This analysis shows that although modeling pronunciation variation brings about improvements, <b>deteriorations</b> are also introduced. A strong correlation is found between the number of improvements and <b>deteriorations</b> per rule. This result indicates that it is not straightforward to improve the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR) by excluding the rules that cause <b>deteriorations,</b> because these rules also produce a considerable number of improvements. Finally, we compare three different criteria for rule selection. This comparison indicates that the absolute frequency of rule application (F abs) is the most suitable criterion for rule selection. For the best testing condition, a statistically significant reduction in Word Error Rate (WER) of 1. 4 % absolute, or 8. 2 % relative, is found. 1...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Weight {{change may}} be {{considered}} an effect of depression. In turn, depression may follow weight change. <b>Deteriorations</b> in health may mediate these associations. The objective was to examine reciprocal associations between depressed mood and weight change, and the potentially mediating role of <b>deteriorations</b> in health (interim hospitalizations and incident mobility imitation) in these associations. Methods: Data were from 2406 black and white men and women, aged 70 - 79 from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Memphis, Tennessee participating in the Health, Aging and Body composition (Health ABC) study. Depressed mood at baseline (T 1) and 3 -year follow-up (T 4) was measured with the CES-D scale. Three weight change groups (T 1 -T 4) were created: loss (≥ 5 % loss), stable (within ± 5 % loss or gain), and weight gain (≥ 5 % gain). Results: At T 1 and T 4, respectively 4. 4 % and 9. 5 % of the analysis sample had depressed mood. T 1 depressed mood was associated with weight gain over the 3 -year period (OR: 1. 91; 95 %CI: 1. 13 - 3. 22). Weight loss over the 3 -year period was associated with T 4 depressed mood (OR: 1. 51; 95 %CI: 1. 05 - 2. 16). Accounting for <b>deteriorations</b> in health in the reciprocal associations between weight change and depressed mood reduced effect sizes between 16 - 27 %. Conclusions: In this study, depressed mood predicted weight gain over three years, while weight loss over three years predicted depressed mood. These associations were partly mediated through <b>deteriorations</b> in health. Implications for clinical practice and prevention include increased awareness that depressed mood can cause weight change, but can also be preceded by <b>deteriorations</b> in health and weight change. © 2010 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry...|$|R

30|$|The {{symptomatic}} {{results of}} this study are almost consistent with previous studies in which TMJ symptoms improved. Ueki et al. [17] found that the incidence of TMJ symptoms decreased after SSRO although SSRO did not change the disk position. According to Togashi et al. [18], the incidence of TMJ signs and symptoms significantly decreased from 29.5 % before orthognathic surgery to 12.1 % at one year after the surgery. Also, TMJ signs and symptoms decreased in 82.4 % of symptomatic patients before the surgery. In this study, both symptomatic patients with and without preoperative TMD treatment had favorable changes of TMJ symptoms. Especially, TMJ noise decreased significantly in both groups. Although <b>deteriorations</b> of the symptoms were unusually shown, TMJ pain generally improved after the surgery. There were significant improvements and no <b>deteriorations</b> in study group, but a few <b>deteriorations</b> and unsignificant changes in control group. We speculated that it is the reason that the control group included some TMD patients with facial asymmetry. The comparison of LOM was little meaningful because of insufficiency of subjects with preexisting LOM.|$|R
