5|$|In March 2015, The National Marine Fisheries Service {{responded to}} {{a court order to}} compile {{information}} as to whether the shark will be listed as threatened or endangered under The <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some local {{populations of}} {{specific}} subspecies, {{or in the}} case of steelhead, distinct population segments, are listed as either threatened or endangered under the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b> The steelhead is the official state fish of Washington.|$|E
5|$|The United States Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service have {{classified}} hawksbills {{as endangered}} under the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> since 1970. The US government established several recovery plans for protecting E. imbricata.|$|E
5000|$|Four of {{the eight}} rare plants are endemic and known to exist only in the Pine Hill area and nowhere else. [...] Five {{of the eight}} species are listed as {{threatened}} <b>species</b> or <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> under {{both the state and}} federal <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> <b>acts.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Butte Creek {{population}} of spring-run Chinook salmon {{is one of}} the few remaining self-sustaining populations in the Central Valley and is listed as threatened under both the state and federal <b>endangered</b> <b>species</b> <b>acts.</b> The reserve protects habitat for other species such as bald eagle, Swainson's hawk, beaver and the western pond turtle.|$|R
5|$|The {{birth of}} wolf pups {{so close to}} the state border raised the {{probability}} of a future long-term wolf population in California. In June 2014, the California Fish and Game Commission voted 3–1 to protect those wolves under the state <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
5|$|Twenty-six {{amphibian}} {{species are}} found in Michigan, one of the fifty United States. These species include twelve species of frog, twelve species of salamander and two species of toad, {{all members of the}} class Amphibia. Blanchard's cricket frog, a subspecies of northern cricket frog, is considered to be threatened and two species, the marbled salamander and small-mouth salamander, are considered endangered; these are protected under the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of the State of Michigan. Two more species, the boreal chorus frog and lesser siren, are considered to be of special concern, although they are not protected under the act. There are no amphibians native to Michigan that are included in the federal <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
5|$|Granny {{was also}} used as a focal point of {{environmental}} efforts {{that resulted in the}} <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> protections for orca. Environmentalists estimate that Granny may have had a PCB load of up to 100 parts per million, and that her descendants' reproductive systems may have been damaged by exposure to pollution. Additionally, declining West Coast salmon populations put Granny and her family at risk.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} the use of conservation easements in the Habitat Conservation Planning process, {{which is part of}} the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act’s</b> section 10 permitting program. This article addresses the enforcement difficulties that might arise with HCP-exacted conservation easements. To ensure the reliability of this land preservation tool, I recommend including provisions for continued federal enforcement in conservation easement agreements and enabling public enforcement of the agreements...|$|R
50|$|Weeks Creek {{is a small}} creek {{tributary}} to La Honda Creek, {{which in}} turn is tributary to San Gregorio Creek in western San Mateo County, California. San Gregorio Creek drains to the Pacific Ocean at San Gregorio State Beach. The San Gregorio Creek watershed supports several species listed under the federal and State of California <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Acts.</b> These <b>species</b> include—coho salmon (<b>endangered),</b> steelhead (threatened), Tidewater Goby, San Francisco Garter Snake, and California Red-legged frog.|$|R
50|$|Through the 1960s and 1970s, {{the society}} {{began to use}} its {{influence}} {{to focus attention on}} a wider range of environmental issues and became involved in developing major new environmental protection policies and laws. Audubon staff and members helped legislators pass the Clean Air, Clean Water, Wild and Scenic Rivers, and <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>acts.</b> In 1969, the society opened an office in Washington, D.C., {{in an effort to keep}} legislators informed of Audubon's priorities.|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{hunting and}} habitat loss have {{severely}} impacted American alligator populations throughout their range, {{and whether the}} species would survive was in doubt. In 1967, the American alligator was listed as an endangered species (under a law that was the precursor <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of 1973), since it {{was believed to be}} in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, {{great white}} sharks {{were added to}} California's <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b> From data collected, the {{population}} of great whites in the North Pacific {{was estimated to be}} fewer than 340 individuals. Research also reveals these sharks are genetically distinct from other members of their species elsewhere in Africa, Australia, and the east coast of North America, having been isolated from other populations.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for {{the west side of}} the San Joaquin Valley in order to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and keep alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E
50|$|The turtle {{is listed}} as Endangered under the Commonwealth <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Protection <b>Act</b> 1992, as Vulnerable under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992, and as of Least Concern under the Northern Territory's Territory Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 2000.|$|R
5000|$|The {{predecessor}} of the ESA was the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Preservation <b>Act</b> of 1966 (P.L. 89-669 [...] ). Passed by Congress, {{this act}} permitted the listing of native U.S. animal <b>species</b> as <b>endangered</b> and for limited protections upon those animals.|$|R
2500|$|Because of the {{incredibly}} high construction and maintenance costs of dams and generation equipment, outside investment {{is key to}} the hydropower industry. [...] This means that the ESA is a hindrance to the industry's growth. [...] The protected species are largely aquatic types whose migration patterns and feeding habits might be affected by the construction and subsequent operation of a dam. [...] In the Pacific Northwest, the Columbia River alone has seen the construction of 75 dams between 1930 and 1990. [...] It led to the depletion of salmon populations that have since been added to the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act's</b> list.|$|R
5|$|The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has 15 {{identified}} distinct population segments (DPS)s, in Washington, Oregon, and California. Eleven {{of these}} DPSs are listed under the U.S. <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act,</b> ten as threatened and one as endangered. One DPS on the Oregon Coast is designated a U.S. Species of Concern.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand {{have responded}} to the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive experiments on certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out experiments on chimpanzees.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is listed}} as Least Concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Historically, hunting had decimated their population, and the American alligator was listed as an endangered species by the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of 1973. Subsequent conservation efforts have allowed their numbers to increase and the species {{was removed from the}} list in 1987. American alligators are now harvested for their skins and meat. The species is the official state reptile of three states: Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, the House of Representatives {{passed the}} 21st Century <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Transparency <b>Act,</b> {{which would require}} the {{government}} to disclose the data it uses to determine species classification, but the President threatened a veto and the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate.|$|R

50|$|It {{was first}} {{compiled}} in 1979, {{and published in}} 1981, with revisions published in 1988 and 1996. In its early days {{it was the only}} nationally recognised list of threatened plants, although it had no legal status. When the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Protection <b>Act</b> 1992 was proclaimed, the ROTAP list was used as a basis for the publication of schedules to the Act. A third list was produced by ANZECC from 1996. In 2000, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) was proclaimed. This superseded the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Protection <b>Act</b> 1992, and published a single list of threatened flora which largely superseded the three lists then current. As the EPBC list has legal force, the ROTAP list is now little used. It continues to be maintained, however, and is often used and referred to in scientific publications.|$|R
5|$|Three {{species of}} {{reptiles}} {{are considered to}} be threatened and two species are endangered– these are protected under the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of the State of Michigan. Six more species {{are considered to be}} of special concern, though not protected under the act. The copperbelly water snake is listed as threatened by the federal government, while the eastern massasauga rattlesnake is a candidate species to be included on the US endangered species list.|$|E
5|$|All {{sirenians}} {{are protected}} by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> (ESA), and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to this, the four species are further protected by various specialty organizations. The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species, and the Coral Triangle Initiative. In Florida, manatees {{are protected by}} the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978, which implements actions such as the limitation or prohibition of watercraft speeds where manatees exist.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E
40|$|Chip mills turn trees into {{chips for}} paper, particle-boards, and exports. While the federal {{government}} does not collect data on a chip mill industry, chip production in the South has apparently been expanding. The timber supply appears sufficient to allow some increased harvests, but could be depleted by continued industrial expansion. The federal government does not directly regulate timber cutting but could become engaged if requirements of the Clean Water and <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Acts</b> were triggered. The government also has export promotion programs and export tax incentives. Recently, concerns have been expressed to Congress about the possible effects of clear-cutting for chip exports on water quality and wildlife habitat. This report will not be updated...|$|R
40|$|The Whooping Crane (Grus americana) {{is one of}} {{the rarest}} bird species in the world (Harrell and Bidwell 2013). Whooping Cranes are listed as {{endangered}} by the United States and Canada under their respective <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Acts</b> (CWS and USFWS 2007) and by the Nebraska Nongame and <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Conservation <b>Act.</b> Whooping Crane numbers in the Aransas-Wood Buffalo (AWB) flock, the only self-sustaining wild population, were estimated to be as low as 14 adults and 4 juveniles during the winter of 1938 - 1939 (CWS and USFWS 2007). During the winter of 2014 - 2015, the estimated size of the AWB flock was 308 individuals (USFWS 2015). Birds in the AWB flock migrate more than 3, 500 km twice each year through the Great Plains of North America between their breeding grounds in Wood Buffalo National Park, Canada, and wintering sites in and around Aransas National Wildlife Refuge, Texas. Annually in spring and fall, usually all of the Whooping Cranes in the AWB flock migrate through Nebraska. Many birds in the AWB flock interrupt their migration and stop at sites in Nebraska where they locate nighttime roost sites, rest and feed. Migratory stopover in Nebraska is therefore an important part of their survival, conservation and recovery...|$|R
50|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} the {{species in the}} journal Nuytsia by the botanist Bruce Maslin in 1974. The name ‘aphylla’ in latin means without leaves, due {{to the absence of}} phyllodes. A. aphylla was recorded as rare in 1950 and after 1992 it was listed as vulnerable then became protected under the <b>Endangered</b> <b>species</b> Protection <b>Act</b> 1992.|$|R
5|$|Conservation and {{recovery}} plans for A. brownii {{have been proposed}} by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) which administers the island of Nihoa {{as part of the}} Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge in the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument. In 1996, the plant was listed by the FWS as an endangered species. In 2003, the FWS designated the island of Nihoa as a critical habitat for the plant and it was classified as critically endangered on the IUCN Red List. The plant is one of 51 endangered or threatened plants in the Hawaiian Islands listed under the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
5|$|Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the United States <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act,</b> and {{regulated}} {{in international trade}} by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Using ground counts and aerial surveys, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calculates the population density of the common eland to be between 0.05 and 1 per square kilometre with a total population estimate of 136,000. Populations are considered stable or increasing in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi and possibly Tanzania.|$|E
5|$|Both the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) {{and state}} {{wildlife}} {{agencies in the}} South contributed to the American alligator's recovery. Protection under the <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> allowed the species to recuperate in many areas {{where it had been}} depleted. States began monitoring their American alligator populations to ensure that they would continue to grow. In 1987, the USFWS removed the animal from the endangered species list, as it was considered to be fully recovered. The USFWS still regulates the legal trade in American alligators and their products to protect still endangered crocodilians that may be passed off as American alligators during trafficking.|$|E
50|$|The pink-billed parrotfinch is {{protected}} under Schedule 1 of Fiji's <b>Endangered</b> and Protected <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are threatened with extinction.|$|R
25|$|Under Schedule 1 Part 2 of the Commonwealth <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Protection <b>Act</b> 1992 and Schedule 2 of the NSW Threatened <b>Species</b> <b>Act</b> 1995 {{and under}} Schedule 3 Part 3 of the QLD Nature Conservation Act 1992 G. Kennedyana is {{currently}} listed as ‘vulnerable’. This {{means that the}} plant is not currently endangered but will be at risk in the next 20–50 years, but it is considered ‘adequately conserved’ as {{majority of the population}} resides in a national park.|$|R
40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{decline of}} many wild cat populations {{is becoming increasingly}} evident. This decline {{may be attributed to}} several factors: (1) the fur trade; (2) the pet trade; (3) habitat destruction; (4) predator control programs; and (5) trophy hunting activities. Legislation {{in the form of the}} <b>Endangered</b> <b>Species</b> Conservation <b>Act</b> has moved to counteract such population decreases through partial restriction of wild felid importation...|$|R
