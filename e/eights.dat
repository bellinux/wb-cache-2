The following week, Anderson accepted Aces & <b>Eights</b> offer, turning heel again in the process.

Anderson wrestled his return match on three days later at Genesis, defeating Samoa Joe after interference from Aces & <b>Eights</b> member Mike Knox.

5|$|If {{a player}} is dealt {{a pair of}} <b>eights,</b> the total of 16 is {{considered}} a troublesome hand. In fact, the value 16 {{is said to be}} the worst hand one can have in blackjack. Since sixteen of the other fifty cards have a value of 10 and four have a value of 11, there is a strong chance of getting at least an 18 with either or both split cards. A hand totaling 18 or 19 is much stronger than having a 16. Splitting <b>eights</b> limits one's losses and improves one's hand. Probabilistic research of expected value scenarios shows that by splitting <b>eights</b> one can convert a hand that presents an expected loss to two hands that may present an expected profit or a reduced loss, depending on what the dealer is showing. A split pair of <b>eights</b> is expected to win against dealer upcards of 2 through 7 and to lose less against dealer upcards of 8 through ace. If a player hits on a pair of <b>eights,</b> he is expected to lose $52 for a $100 bet. If the player splits the <b>eights,</b> he is expected to lose only $43 for a $100 bet.|$|E
