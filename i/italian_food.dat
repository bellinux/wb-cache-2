5|$|David's {{first five}} books, {{particularly}} the earlier works, contained recipes interspersed with literary quotation {{and descriptions of}} people and places that inspired her. By {{the time of her}} third book, <b>Italian</b> <b>Food,</b> David had begun to add sections {{about the history of the}} cuisine and the particular dishes that she wrote about. Her interest in the history of cooking led her in her later years to research the history of spices, baking, and ice.|$|E
5|$|A further réchauffé, drawn principally from Mediterranean Food, <b>Italian</b> <b>Food,</b> French Provincial Cooking and An Omelette and a Glass of Wine. Sections are headed, Soups, Small dishes, Salads, Pasta, gnocchi & polenta, Rice, beans & lentils, Main dishes, Breads, and Desserts. Recipes {{range from}} aillade toulousaine (garlic and walnut sauce) and Angevin salad (lettuce and endive with Gruyère or Emmenthal cheese) to {{watercress}} and potato soup and zuppa pavese (bread and egg soup). The book was illustrated with photographs by Kristin Perers, {{and published by}} Quadrille.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} she {{completed}} <b>Italian</b> <b>Food,</b> Lehmann's publishing firm had been closed down by its parent company, and David found herself under contract to Macdonald, another imprint within the same group. She intensely disliked the company and wrote a most unflattering portrait {{of it in a}} 1985 article. Disliking the approach to her books that the company took, she left Macdonald and signed a contract with the publisher Museum Press for her next book, Summer Cooking, which was published in 1955.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those in <b>Italian</b> <b>Food,</b> there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

25|$|For a {{different}} type of dining experience, the Pink Door (founded 1981), entered by a nearly unmarked door on upper Post Alley, is a favorite first-date restaurant, with solid <b>Italian</b> <b>food,</b> a fantasia of a dining room, a bar that sometimes features live jazz, and an outdoor deck overlooking Elliott Bay. Another restaurant combining <b>Italian</b> <b>food</b> and romantic ambience is the Il Bistro, located below grade in the Economy Market, off the winding cobblestones of Lower Post Alley. When it was founded in 1977 it was {{played an important role in}} the rise of fine dining in Seattle.|$|E

50|$|Every {{year from}} June to September, {{celebrations}} honoring several Roman Catholic saints {{are held in}} the streets of Boston's North End.

In Charlie Chaplin's anti-war comedy The Great Dictator, {{the title character}} speaks English mixed with a parody of German (e.g. [...] "Cheese-und-cracken"). This was also used by Benzino Napaloni, the parody character of Benito Mussolini, using <b>Italian</b> <b>foods</b> (such as salami and ravioli) as insults.|$|R
25|$|When Italian {{immigrants}} {{arrived in}} Boston {{in the early}} 20th century, they brought their religious traditions with them. In Italy it was common for Catholics to celebrate the feast day of their local patron saint. Italian Americans in Boston still hold several of these festivals each year. Some are three-day street festivals complete with parades, fireworks, contests, live music, and <b>Italian</b> <b>food</b> concessions. Others, due to shifts in the population, have become smaller-scale events consisting mainly of a mass and a procession. The festivals attract tourists from across the world.|$|E
25|$|Among American-born {{citizens}} of Polish ancestry, roughly 50% report eating Polish dishes, and many can name {{a variety of}} Polish foods unprompted. Whereas over 60% of Italian Americans reported eating <b>Italian</b> <b>food</b> {{at least once a}} week, less than 10% of Polish Americans ate Polish food once a week. This figure is still a higher occurrence than Irish Americans, who can only name a few traditional Irish foods (typically corned beef and cabbage), and only 30% report eating Irish food each year. Even fewer English, Dutch, and Scottish Americans can report that they eat ethnic cuisine regularly.|$|E

50|$|The word pizza {{was first}} {{documented}} in AD 997 in Gaeta and successively {{in different parts}} of Central and Southern Italy.

25|$|The dialogical part of ontological hermeneutics {{states that}} Dasein co-creates meaning from his self-interpretations and {{subjective}} experiences {{through the process}} of dialogue, i.e. conversing with others. Human beings are constantly engaged in dialogue with others and their world around them. Macmurray postulated that dialogue is our primary, if not only, source of knowledge. Bakhtin claimed that human beings are more than beings who engage in dialogue, but that they are dialogical beings composed of multiple simultaneous voices: voices that are their own and voices that belong to others. These voices represent who Dasein is, his or her dispositions, and his or her roles in society. In this case, the term voice is meant to signify a particular role Dasein takes up or a particular aspect of who Dasein is. These voices of human beings are not {{to be thought of as}} hallucinated voices, as in psychosis, but rather different elements of who Dasein is: I like <b>Italian</b> <b>food</b> as one voice and I do not like it when people interrupt me as another voice, or I am a therapist as one voice but I am a patient when I visit my primary care physician as another. That is not to say that these voices determine Dasein's actions or behaviors. On the contrary, Dasein is an agentic being (a being capable of choice) who thinks, acts, and chooses for himself. But this process “emerges through conversations among functionally independent elements within persons” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2). The emergence of these multiple voices within us via multitudes of ongoing conversations with others is why Bakhtin described us as polyphonic beings, or “products of ongoing series of dialogues among distinct voices” (Lysaker & Lysaker: 2).|$|E
500|$|<b>Italian</b> <b>Food</b> was warmly {{received}} by reviewers and the public, {{and the first}} print run sold out within three weeks. The Times Literary Supplement book reviewer wrote, [...] "More than a collection of recipes, this book is in effect a readable and discerning dissertation on <b>Italian</b> <b>food</b> and regional dishes, and their preparation in the English kitchen." [...] Freya Stark, reviewing for The Observer, remarked, [...] "Mrs David... may be counted among the benefactors of humanity."

500|$|While in Venice {{during her}} culinary tour of Italy, David met the artist Renato Guttuso. They {{struck up a}} friendship, and he agreed to {{illustrate}} her book, which he did, despite the very small fee offered by David's publisher. With two successful books already published, David felt less in need of extracts from earlier writers to bolster her own prose. The Times Literary Supplement said, [...] "More than a collection of recipes, this is book is in effect a readable and discerning [...] dissertation on <b>Italian</b> <b>food</b> and regional dishes, and their preparation in the English kitchen. The text is divided into kinds of food, with chapters on rice, pasta and Italian wines." [...] In The Observer, Freya Stark wrote, [...] "Mrs. David … may be counted among the benefactors of humanity." [...] In The Sunday Times, [...] Evelyn Waugh named <b>Italian</b> <b>Food</b> {{as one of the}} two books that had given him the most pleasure in that year. In 2009, Sir Terence Conran called it [...] "the very best book about <b>Italian</b> <b>food</b> that has ever been published here".|$|E
50|$|The {{sauce is}} often {{seasoned}} with more oregano than other pizza types. Despite its thin crust, St. Louis-style pizza can be layered deeply with many different toppings {{because of the}} sturdiness of the cracker-like crust.

500|$|<b>Italian</b> <b>Food</b> {{begins with}} a chapter on [...] "The Italian store cupboard", giving British cooks, who at that time were {{generally}} unacquainted with most of Italy's cuisine and methods, an insight into Italian herbs, spices, tinned, bottled or dried staples including anchovies, tuna, funghi, prosciutto, and chickpeas, and Italian essentials such as garlic and olive oil, both seldom seen in Britain in the early 1950s. The rest of the book follows the basic pattern of the earlier works, with chapters on soups, fish, meat, vegetables and sweets, {{with the addition of}} extra subjects relevant to <b>Italian</b> <b>food,</b> pasta asciuta, ravioli and gnocchi, rice, and Italian wine.
