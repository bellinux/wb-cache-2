40|$|BACKGROUND Primary Objective of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect on <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> on subsequent pregnancies after a miscarriage. Secondary Objective was to study the maternal and foetal complications following shorter <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS This study was done in OBG Department, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, during 2011 to 2013. A total of 347 cases were studied who have had a miscarriage before the current pregnancy. RESULTS Compared with women with an <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> of 6 - 12 months, those who conceived again within six months were more likely to have another miscarriage and ectopic gestation (odds ratio 0. 106, p value 0. 000.). Compared with women with <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> of < 6 months, women who conceived again in 6 - 12 months went on to have a vaginal delivery in the second pregnancy (Odd’s ratio 0. 79 and p value in is significant). Lower segment caesarean section (LSCS) is significantly high in women whose <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> is more than 12 months (Odds ratio 0. 64 and p value 0. 000). Maternal complications like APH, PPH, preeclampsia, hypertension, etc. were significantly seen higher in women whose <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> is more than 12 months (odds ratio 0. 41 p value- 0. 000). The women with <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> less than 6 months didn’t develop any significant foetal complications. Most of the complications like premature rupture of membrane (PROM), meconium stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), oligamnios, foetal growth restriction (FGR), etc. are seen more in the women with <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> 6 to 12 months odds ratio (0. 30 p value significant), but breech and foetal distress are seen significantly higher in women with <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> more than 12 months (Odds ratio 0. 29 p value 0. 000). Induction of labour was not significantly raised in any group. CONCLUSION Women who conceive within 6 months of an initial miscarriage have the best reproductive outcomes and lower complication rates in a subsequent pregnancy...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: to {{investigate}} {{the relationship between the}} <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> and low birth weight and other pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: this case-control study was carried out in hospitals from January 2010 to April 2011. For cases, mothers of 1216 newborns with birth weight 2500 g were approached and 854 mothers participated in this study (73. 7 %). Face-to-face interviews were conducted to complete the questionnaires. RESULTS: of the newborn babies with low birth weight, the risk was higher among mothers with a short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> (40. 3 %), whereas for infants with normal birth weight, the majority of the mothers had a longer <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> of 24 months (44. 7 %). A short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> of 612 months was more common among women of < 25 years (49. 4 %; p< 0. 001) and those who were illiterate (13. 1 %; p= 0. 043) with a higher risk of low birth weight compared to the controls. Prenatal care during the 1 st trimester was lower in women with low birth weight children (p< 0. 001). Normal delivery was observed less in women with a short birth interval among cases (58. 7 %) compared to controls (79 %) (p= 0. 001).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} extent to which women {{received}} contraceptive services within 90 days after birth at their first or subsequent visits and whether contra-ceptive provision was associated with optimal interpreg-nancy intervals. METHOD: We linked California’s 2008 Birth Statistical Master File with Medicaid databases to build a cohort of women aged 15 – 44 years who had given birth in 2008 and received publicly-funded health care services in the 18 months after their previous live birth (N 5117, 644). We determined whether provision of con-traception within 90 days after birth was associated with optimal <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> when controlling for covariates. RESULT: Only 41 % (n 548, 775) of women had a contra-ceptive claim within 90 days after birth. To avoid short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals,</b> 6 women would need to receive contraception to avoid one additional short interval (number needed to treat 56. 38). Receipt of a con-traceptive method, receiving contraception at the first clinic visit, and being seen by Medi-Cal and its family planning expansion program were significantly associ-ated with avoidance of short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals.</b> Receiving contraception at the first postpartum clinic visit had an additional independent effect on avoiding short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> when controlling for the other variables. Although foreign-born women had 47 % higher odds of avoiding short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> than U. S. -born women, women of Asian and Pacific Islander ethnicity had 24 % lower odds of avoiding short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> than white women.

40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo analyze {{data from}} recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) {{conducted}} in 21 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to examine patterns of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals,</b> unmet need, pregnancy risk {{and family planning}} method use and method mix among women 0 – 23 months postpartum. Study designSecondary analysis of postpartum women aged 15 – 49 years in 22 DHS surveys from 21 LMICs conducted between 2005 and 2012. We applied an adapted unmet need definition for postpartum women to look at prospective fertility preferences. We also constructed a new composite pregnancy risk indicator for postpartum {{women who have been}} sexually active since their last birth. ResultsIn 9 of 22 surveys, 50 % or more of nonfirst births occur at <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> that are too short. Overall prospective unmet need for family planning by postpartum women has not changed demonstrably since a 2001 analysis and is universally high: 61 % of all postpartum women across the 21 countries have an unmet need for family planning. In 10 of 22 surveys, pregnancy risk rises steadily throughout the 2 years after birth. In the remaining 12 surveys, the risk of pregnancy peaks at 6 – 11 months after birth. Even when postpartum women are using family planning, they rely overwhelmingly on short-acting methods (51 – 96 % in 21 of 22 surveys). ConclusionOur approach of estimating pregnancy risk by postpartum timing confirms a high probability for pregnancies to be less than optimally spaced within 2 years of a prior birth and suggests that special consideration is needed to effectively reach this population with the right messages and services. ImplicationsUsing recent, multicountry data for women within 2 years postpartum in LMICs, this paper updates existing estimates of high prospective unmet need for family planning and presents a new composite pregnancy risk analysis based on postpartum women’s actual practices to demonstrate the magnitude of missed opportunities for programmatic intervention for the postpartum population...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} impact of the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> and a {{previous}} preterm birth on the subsequent risk of a preterm birth. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on a group of 4072 women who had at least two consecutive births, excluding multiple gestation, fetal anomalies, cervical incompetence, and stillbirth. Multivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the association between <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval,</b> preterm birth of thefirst child in the pair (index pregnancy), and the risk ofa preterm birth of the second child in the pair (outcome pregnancy). RESULTS: Women with interpregnancy intervals of less than 12 months (odds ratio [OR] 1. 3; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 0 - 1. 7) were at increased risks of preterm birth with the outcome pregnancy. Furthermore, there was an increased riskfor a subsequent preterm birth in women who had a preterm birth in the index pregnancy (OR 4. 2; 95 % CI 3. 0 - 6. 0). The risk decreased as the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> increased, with a relatively low risk at 18 to 48 months; subsequently, it increased sharply. In contrast, women who had delivered their previous infants at term carried an increased risk ofpreterm birth with the outcome pregnancy only if the interval was less than 6 months.

The prevalence of primary cesarean birth was only 6. 3 percent in the Cambodians, compared to 15. 6 percent in the comparison group, largely due to the infrequent occurrence of prolonged labor among multiparas. Despite the prominence of several risk factors for adverse birth outcomes in this population, major pregnancy complications were less common and the prevalence of low birthweight (6. 4 percent) was close to the state average. Logistic regression analysis of risk factors for low birthweight identified young maternal age and short stature as the strongest factors operative in this community.

40|$|Background: From {{conception}} to 6 {{months of}} age, an infant is entirely dependent for its nutrition on the mother: via the placenta and then ideally via exclusive breastfeeding. This period of 15 months – about 500 days – {{is the most}} important and vulnerable in a child's life: it must be protected through policies supporting maternal nutrition and health. Those addressing nutritional status are discussed here. Objective and design: This paper aims to summarize research on policies and programs to protect women's nutrition in order to improve birth outcomes in low- and middle-income countries, based on studies of efficacy from the literature, and on effectiveness, globally and in selected countries involving in-depth data collection in communities in Ethiopia, India and Northern Nigeria. Results of this research have been published in the academic literature (more than 30 papers). The conclusions now need to be advocated to policy-makers. Results: The priority problems addressed are: intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), women's anemia, thinness, and stunting. The priority interventions that need to be widely expanded for women before and during pregnancy, are: supplementation with iron–folic acid or multiple micronutrients; expanding coverage of iodine fortification of salt particularly to remote areas and the poorest populations; targeted provision of balanced protein energy supplements when significant resources are available; reducing teenage pregnancies; increasing <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> through family planning programs; and building on conditional cash transfer programs, both to provide resources and as a platform for public education. All these have known efficacy but are of inadequate coverage and resourcing. The next steps are to overcome barriers to wide implementation, without which targets for maternal and child health and nutrition (e. g. by WHO) are unlikely to be met, especially in the poorest countries. Conclusions: This agenda requires policy decisions both at Ministry and donor levels, and throughout the administrative system.

40|$|The {{interval}} between one pregnancy {{and the next}} may affect the outcome of pregnancy. Both short and long <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervals</b> (IPI) {{have been associated with}} adverse pregnancy outcomes and most of these occur with a short IPI. Our primary objective was {{to determine the effects of}} a short IPI (< 24 months) compared with a long IPI (≥ 24 months) on the subsequent potentially viable pregnancy in women who received antenatal care (ANC) in the secondary level hospitals in the Metro-West area of Cape Town. The secondary objective was to review possible determinants of a short IPI. Methods: This was a pilot descriptive cross-sectional study conducted between 1 st September 2016 and 28 th November 2016. One hundred and thirty women who were Para 2 were recruited to the study in the early postnatal period. Sixty women were recruited into the short IPI group (< 24 months) and 70 to the long IPI group (≥ 24 months). Questionnaire-based interviews were conducted and data were entered using Microsoft Excel 2012 spread sheets. Statistical analysis was done using Stata® Edition 13. Results: We analysed the data for both short and long IPI and found that there were no significant differences in preterm birth, abruptio placentae, preterm prelabour rupture of membranes (PPROM) and low birth weight. There was however a significant difference in the number of small-for-gestational- age (SGA) babies. In the short IPI group, 19 women (31. 7 %) had SGA babies in comparison to the long IPI group where 7 women (10 %) had SGA babies(p = 0. 015). Of the 130 respondents, 79 women (60. 8 %) had unintended pregnancies, 44 (73 %) with a short IPI vs 35 (50 %) with a long IPI (p = 0. 017). Women with a long IPI were more likely to have a different partner for the subsequent pregnancy (p= 0. 002). Women in relationships longer than 5 years were more likely to have a long IPI (p = 0. 049). Thirty-eight women (63. 3 %) with a short IPI would have preferred the pregnancy later compared to 11 women (15. 7 %) with a long IPI (p< 0. 001). There were 27 (38 %) women who supported themselves financially in the long IPI group compared with 8 (13 %) with a short IPI (p= 0. 001). A long IPI was associated with more formal employment and professional careers compared to a short IPI (p= 0. 002). In the long IPI group 10 women (7 %) had professional positions compared with none in the short IPI group (p= 0. 002). There were no significant differences in breastfeeding duration, contraception use and knowledge, social habits, previous obstetric history, educational status or emotional support between the two groups. Conclusion: In our study, of all the pregnancy outcomes investigated, small-for-gestational age was the only clinical outcome significantly associated with a short IPI. There were differences in pregnancy intendedness, duration of relationships, financial support and employment between the two groups.

40|$|ABSTRACT During {{the last}} decade {{there have been many}} reports {{indicating}} a decline in breast feeding practices in the urban areas of developing countries. This decline might have adverse effects on maternal and child health. A study of 1079 urban hospital attending women was undertaken to evaluate their breast feeding practices. Prolonged (mean duration of lactation 19. 8 months) and successful lactation (failure of lactation occurred in only 3. 5 %) was common among this group. But a trend toward shorter duration of breast feeding was found among educationally and economically better off segment. There was very good correlation between mean duration of lactation, lactational amenorrhea, and <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>intervaL</b> Therefore, it is possible that decrease in duration of lactation might result in shorter <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> The duration of lactation appeared to be “fixed ” for each individual irrespective of age and parity. This in turn resulted in “fixed ” duration of lactationi amenorrhea and <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> under conditions of unhin-dered lactation and uncontrolled fertility. Conception during lactational amenorrhea was low (7. 7 %) but once periods were reestablished lactation offered very little protection against concep-tion. Am. J. Clin. Nuir. 32 : 1298 - 1303, 1979. Since time immemorial, it has been be-lieved that breast feeding prolongs postpar-tum amenorrhea and that it provides some degree of protection against pregnancy. In recent years world wide demographic and laboratory investigations have substantiated these common beliefs (1 - 10). During the last two decades there have been reports (2, 11, 12) indicating that breast feeding practices have declined in urban areas in developing countries. Data of Berman et al.

The present report deals with the results of a study undertaken among urban hospital attending women to investigate breast feeding practices and to evaluate the importance of factors influenc-ing the duration of breast feeding.

40|$|INTRODUCTION 	Preeclampsia, a {{hypertensive}} disorder of pregnancy, affects 3 % to 7 % of women throughout the world. Preeclampsia {{is a leading}} cause of maternal and infant mortality worldwide, occurring primarily in nulliparous women. Despite extensive research over the past decade, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the disease are largely unknown. A recent hypothesis has suggested that when a pregnancy is complicated by preeclampsia, it is the result of an inability of the maternal cardiovascular system to fully adapt to the physiologic challenge of pregnancy. This may result when there is an underlying and predisposing prepregnancy maternal cardiovascular state that leads to the pathophysiologic consequences of preeclampsia when pregnancy is superimposed. 	Despite evidence for familial predisposition and presumed multifactorial genetic inheritance, preeclampsia generally occurs in first pregnancies and does not recur when the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> is short. One explanation for these observations is that pregnancy itself modifies the maternal cardiovascular system in ways that persist postpartum and reduce the risk for preeclampsia recurrence, at least for a limited period of time. It has been demonstrated that the maternal cardiovascular system is remodeled during pregnancy, and these changes extend postpartum. The long lasting reduction in mean arterial pressure postpartum that pregnancy induces, and the cardiovascular remodeling that accounts for this, may allow for easier adaptation to volume expansion in subsequent pregnancies, even when the first pregnancy was complicated by preeclampsia. As the maternal cardiovascular system returns, over time, to the baseline condition, this protective effect diminishes. With this knowledge, we hypothesize that the length of time between pregnancies is negatively correlated to the likelihood of recurrence of preeclampsia, and more narrowly that the length of time between pregnancies is inversely associated with mean arterial pressure differences comparing pregnancies across all trimesters. METHODS This study was a retrospective chart review of existing medical records. We reviewed medical records of women who had been diagnosed with preeclampsia at Fletcher Allen Health Care, during their first advanced pregnancy between 1995 and 2014, who went on to have a subsequent pregnancy within that time period. We aimed to identify factors that could affect the blood pressure and risk of preeclampsia in women who were previously diagnosed, including previous medical history and demographic variables. We collected blood pressures from each pregnancy, across each trimester, marking the recurrence of preeclampsia and other complications. Mean antepartum mean arterial blood pressure, pulse pressure, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures were calculated and compared between pregnancies examining differences as a function of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> RESULTS 	One hundred and seventy two subjects were identified for review. Overall, there was evidence of a significant association of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> (IPI) and the difference in mean arterial pressure (MAP) between pregnancies (p= 0. 04). The mean MAP of pregnancy decreased significantly between first and second pregnancies when the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> was 48 months (p= 0. 55). The mean MAP during the third trimester, specifically, decreased significantly between first and second pregnancies across all subject groups (IPI 48 months: p= 0. 03). Preeclampsia recurred in 39 of the second pregnancies. The recurrence rate of preeclampsia did not vary significantly with <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> (p= 0. 21). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS 	The interval between preeclamptic pregnancies and subsequent pregnancies has an influence on the MAP of the second pregnancy. There is good evidence of a temporal influence, in that the shorter interpregnancy intervals resulted in a greater reduction in MAP when compared to the longer <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> We believe that with additional research on interpregnancy intervals > 48 months, there could be more a conclusive association identified between the rate of recurrence of preeclampsia and the length of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval...</b>|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether the length of the interval between pregnancies was associated with either preterm birth or intrauterine growth retardation in a low-income, largely Black population. METHODS: The study population consisted of 4400 women who had received prenatal care in county clinics and had two consecutive singleton births between 1980 and 1990. RESULTS: Interpregnancy intervals were positively associated with age and negatively associated with the trimester in which care was initiated in the second pregnancy. Whites had shorter intervals than non-Whites. The percentage of preterm births increased as the length of the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> decreased, but only for women who had not had a previous preterm birth. The association between interval and preterm birth was maintained when other factors associated with preterm birth were controlled.

The <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> was taken as the length of time between this preceding pregnancy and the last menstrual period before the index pregnancy. The most important factors influencing pregnancy spacing were outcome of the preceding delivery, social class, and maternal age. When these variables had been taken into account we found that the length of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> had little effect on stillbirth rates. High neonatal death rates, however, occurred when interpregnancy intervals were less than six months (P < 0 · 005), though longer intervals had no significant effects...|$|E
40|$|A {{woman with}} a history of {{spontaneous}} abortion in her immediately prior pregnancy may be at increased risk for a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect (NTD). A short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> may further increase this risk. Using data from a population-based case-control study (1989 - 1991), the authors investigated NTD risk resulting from a prior spontaneous abortion or elective termination and a short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> Of 538 interviewed case mothers and 539 interviewed control mothers, 408 case mothers and 433 control mothers reported having a prior pregnancy. Analysis showed a slightly decreased NTD risk among mothers whose immediately prior pregnancy had ended in a spontaneous abortion or elective termination in comparison with a live birth (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 82; 95 % confidence interval (Cl) : 0. 61, 1. 1). This decreased risk was consistent across strata of short or long interpregnancy intervals. Additional analysis revealed an increased NTD risk for mothers with an <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> of ^ 6 months compared with> 12 -£ 24 months (OR = 1. 5; 95 % Cl: 0. 93, 2. 4).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} whether a short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> {{is a risk}} factor for preterm birth in Emirati women, where there is a wide range of interpregnancy intervals and uniformity in potentially confounding factors. METHODS: A case-control design based on medical records was used. A case was defined as a healthy multiparous Emirati woman delivering a healthy singleton spontaneously before 37 weeks of gestation between 1997 and 2000, and a control was defined as the next eligible similar woman delivering after 37 weeks of gestation. Women were excluded if there was no information available about their most recent previous pregnancy or if it had resulted in a multiple or preterm birth. Data collected from charts and delivery room records were analysed using the STATA statistical package. All variables found to be valid, stable and significant by univariate analysis were included in multivariate logistic regression analysis. FINDINGS: There were 128 cases who met the eligibility criteria; 128 controls were selected. Short interpregnancy intervals were significantly associated with case status (P< 0. 05). The multivariate adjusted odds ratios for the 1 st, 2 nd, and 4 th quartiles of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> compared with the lowest-risk 3 rd quartile were 8. 2, 5. 4, and 2. 0 (95 % confidence intervals: 3. 5 - 19. 2, 2. 4 - 12. 6, and 0. 9 - 4. 5 respectively). CONCLUSION: A short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> is {{a risk factor for}} spontaneous preterm birth in Emirati women. The magnitude of the risk and the risk gradient between exposure quartiles suggest that the risk factor is causal and that its modification would reduce the risk of preterm birth...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the fact sheet is to {{highlight}} the demographic characteristics of women with Medicaid reimbursed births by <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> We will also explore prenatal care initiation and infant birth outcomes by <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval.</b> Background Medicaid is a state/federal program that provides health insurance for certain groups of low-income people, including pregnant women. Iowa Medicaid {{is administered by the}} Iowa Department of Human Services through Iowa Medicaid Enterprise. In Iowa, pregnant women may be eligible for Medicaid if their household income is below 300 percent of the federal poverty level. In 2012, the labor and delivery costs for 40 percent of Iowa resident births were reimbursed by Medicaid (40. 3 %; n= 15, 598 of 38, 686 births). Optimal pregnancy intervals The <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> is defined as the amount of time between pregnancies. It is calculated between the date the last pregnancy ended and the date of the woman’s last menstrual period (1). Though there is no official recommendation for the optimal interpregnancy period, experts suggest 18 to 24 months as the ideal time period between pregnancies (2, 3, 4). In recent years, researchers have reported that interpregnancy intervals of less than 18 months can put mothers at risk for anemia (5). Women with short interval pregnancies also are more likely to initiate prenatal care later than women with longer intervals between their pregnancies (6). Women who become pregnant within 18 months after a previous birth are at increased risk for having a low birth weight infant or a preterm birth (2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9). In later life, these children are at increased risk for exposure to maltreatment and lower cognitive functioning (10, 11) ...|$|E
40|$|Background In January 2016, a {{universal}} two-child policy {{was introduced in}} China. The association of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> (IPI) with perinatal outcomes has not previously been assessed among Chinese population. We investigated the effect of IPI after live birth on the risks of preterm delivery, and small, and large for gestational age births in China. Methods We conducted a cohort study among 227 352 Chinese women with their first and second delivery during 2000 to 2015. IPI was calculated as months from first live delivery to conception of the second pregnancy. Poisson regression models with robust variance were fit to evaluate associations of IPI with risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, adjusted for potential confounders. Results Compared to IPI of 24 - 29 months, IPI Conclusions Women with IPI < 18 months after live birth had higher risk of PTB and SGA, and IPI ≥ 60 months was associated with higher risk of PTB and LGA.

40|$|Background: A {{perinatal}} {{death in the}} previous pregnancy can influence {{the moment when the}} next pregnancy occurs and the obstetric management in this next pregnancy by the health care providers. Little is known about the length of the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> after {{perinatal death}}. In the literature, short interpregnancy intervals are associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Knowledge is also scarce about the way in which health care providers act during this next pregnancy. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the influence of a perinatal death on the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> and on the obstetric management in the next pregnancy. Methods: For this study 372 patients who experienced a previous perinatal death and became pregnant again were included in the cohort. In the reference group, 5175 patients with at least two live births were included. In both groups, the mean <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> has been calculated. Information was gained about de neonates in both groups born in the next pregnancy. In addition, information about the number of ctg’s, ultrasound examinations and labor inductions in the next pregnancy was collected. A survey of seven cases was conducted with the nine gynecologists working at the hospital in Deventer, about their obstetric policy in pregnancies after a perinatal death. Results: The mean <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> is significantly shorter after a perinatal death (13, 4 (95 % CI 11, 4 – 15, 4) months) then after a live birth (24, 3 (95 % CI 23, 8 – 24, 7) months). In the pregnancy following a perinatal death, the children are born after a significantly shorter gestational age compared to the children born in the pregnancies after a live birth (267, 2 (SD 19, 6) vs 278, 2 (SD 12, 5) days). There is no significant difference in the amount of dysmaturity and congenital anomalies of the neonates born in the next pregnancy. The incidence of a second perinatal death was 3. 8 %, which is a higher percentage than the incidence of perinatal death in the general Dutch population. After a perinatal death, there are significantly more inductions of labor (50, 1 %) compared to the amount of inductions after a live birth (31, 9 %). The gynecologists in the hospital in Deventer prefer to do more interventions and examinations in the pregnancy following a perinatal death, compared to pregnancies following a live birth. Also, they differ in opinion about the obstetric policy in these pregnancies. Conclusions: The <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> after a perinatal death is almost twice as short as after a live birth. In our study, neonates born after a perinatal death have more adverse outcomes compared to the neonates born in the pregnancy after a live birth. After a perinatal death, we found more labor inductions. The gynecologists who work at the hospital in Deventer, prefer to do more interventions and examinations in the pregnancy following a perinatal death, even if this pregnancy develops without complications. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> on the birthweight of the {{subsequent}} child was investigated in a cohort of 5, 938 women who registered for two consecutive pregnancies in the Collaborative Perinatal Project. Mean birthweight increased from 3, 101 grams for intervals of less than 3 months to 3, 193 grams for intervals of 15 - 17. 9 months and remained stable thereafter (p for trend = 0. 006). However, women with shorter intervals were younger, lighter weight, and less educated {{at the beginning of}} the first pregnancy than were women with longer intervals; the birthweight of their previous child was lower, and they were of marginally lower socioeconomic status. Adjustment for confounders reduced the maximum difference in mean birthweight by interval length from 92 to 39 grams, and blunted the trend for lower birthweights with shorter intervals (p = 0. 45). Similarly, adjustment reduced the increased risk of low birthweight among women with the shortest intervals from 52 per cent to 12 per cent. We conclude that a short <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> is primarily a marker for a woman who is otherwise at high risk, and that modification of this interval alone may be unlikely to have a major impact on low birthweight...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the mediating role of maternal early pregnancy plasma levels of long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) in the association of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> (IPI) with birth weight and smallness for gestational age (SGA) at birth. Methods We analysed a subsample of the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development (ABCD) cohort, comprising 1, 659 parous pregnant women recruited between January 2003 and March 2004. We used linear and logistic regression to evaluate the associations between fatty acid status, <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> and pregnancy outcome. Results Low plasma phospholipids concentrations of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), and high concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA) during early pregnancy were associated with reduced birth weight and/or an increased risk of SGA. Short IPIs (p = 0. 005) and a twofold increased risk of SGA (OR: 2. 05; CI: 0. 93 – 4. 51; p = 0. 074). Adjustment for maternal fatty acid concentrations did not affect these results to any meaningful extent. Conclusions Despite the observed association of maternal early pregnancy LCPUFA status with birth weight and SGA, our study provides no evidence for the existence of an important role of maternal EPA, DHA, DGLA or AA in the association of short interpregnancy intervals with birth weight and SGA. </p...|$|E
40|$|This study compares weight {{change in}} {{lactating}} women with an 18 -month <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> with woman who also breastfed {{but did not}} have an immediate subsequent pregnancy. Cases were women who breastfed an index infant for 6 months and subsequently became pregnant within 18 months (cases = 25), and the controls also breastfed an index infant for 6 months but had no ensuing pregnancy (controls = 20) within 18 months. The pattern of postpartum weight retention following the initial pregnancy was not statistically different in cases compared to the controls. However, following their ensuing subsequent pregnancy, cases were 1. 3 kg heavier than their average weight after their baseline pregnancy (P = 0. 02). The best predictor of this greater weight was their weight change during the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> (P = 0. 03). Total weight gain during the gestational period of the subsequent pregnancy was not associated with the greater weight following the subsequent pregnancy. Likewise, estimates of the amount of energy as calories or physical activity levels were not significant predictors of this greater weight following the subsequent pregnancy. These findings suggest that monitoring of postpartum weight, even in breastfeeding women, is essential. These findings indicate that breastfeeding women begin the next postpartum interval weighing more than the amount observed in the initial postpartum period. J.

40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relationship}} between gestational lengths {{of the first and}} second pregnancies in the same women. Observational study. We used information from a dataset of over 500, 000 pregnancies from 15 maternity units in the North West Thames, London. Data on the gestational length in days of the first pregnancy and the gestational length in days of the second pregnancy were correlated using regression models. First and second pregnancies were ascribed to the same women by identical maternal date of birth, ethnicity and maternal height (to within ± 3 cm). There is a statistically significant cubic relationship between the gestational lengths of the first birth and the second birth (R 0. 102, p< 0. 001). The gestational length of the second pregnancy is likely to be closer to 280 days than the first pregnancy. In the 20 % of women who had an <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> of less than one year, the next pregnancy was one day shorter for every three months less than 12. Although the gestation of second pregnancies exhibits regression towards the mean of 280 days, there is still a clinically important tendency for both preterm and postdates pregnancies to recur.

40|$|The {{lower risk}} of preeclampsia {{observed}} in parous women has prompted a hypothesis that cardiovascular adaptation from a first pregnancy has ongoing benefits which contribute to a reduced risk of preeclampsia in the second pregnancy. However, how the <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> affects mean arterial pressure (MAP) {{as an indicator of}} cardiovascular adaptation in subsequent pregnancies has not been well studied. The authors examined the effect of <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> on MAP in consecutive pregnancies using data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (1959 – 1965) and a semiparametric random-effects regression model. Prenatal MAP measurements were available for 533 women with both first and second births. MAP was lower in the second pregnancy (by approx-imately 2 mmHg) for very short interpregnancy intervals. However, this difference diminished when the interval increased, and it totally disappeared for intervals longer than 2 years. The authors conclude that although MAP is lower in the second pregnancy than in the first pregnancy, the effect persists for only a short time. It is therefore unlikely that mechanisms involving MAP as an indicator of cardiovascular adaptation contribute appreciably to the reduced risk of preeclampsia in subsequent pregnancies. However, it does not {{rule out the possibility that}} other mechanisms of cardiovascular adaptation persist longer. birth intervals; blood pressure; pre-eclampsia; pregnancy Abbreviations: CPP, Collaborative Perinatal Project; MAP, mean arterial pressure...|$|E
40|$|Background: After a woman {{experiences}} a pregnancy loss she often asks her clinician for recommendations on when to try conceiving again. Current recommendations to wait 6 or more months may not {{coincide with the}} woman’s reproductive desires. Several studies have looked at interpregnancy intervals following a live birth, but few have ventured to answer the clinical question of how long a woman should wait to conceive after a miscarriage. Methods: An exhaustive literature search using three databases was conducted with search terms: “interpregnancy interval,” “spontaneous abortion,” and “miscarriage. ” In addition bibliographies from several relevant background articles were used. Included were studies conducted on women with history of a spontaneous abortion at 3 ̆c 20 weeks of gestation who later became pregnant and evaluated interpregnancy intervals (IPI) with emphasis of IPI’s 6 months. Studies needed {{to be based on}} humans and published in the English language. Exclusions were made for women whose preceding pregnancy resulted in live birth or if the study required recurrent spontaneous abortions (SABs). Results: Three studies met inclusion and exclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. One secondary review of a RCT assessed a population of 677 women who had a SAB then subsequently became pregnant found that live birth and complication outcomes were best in the 0 - 3 month IPI in comparison to longer IPI. A prospective cohort study that evaluated 4619 women who were nulliparous, had a SAB, and subsequently became pregnant found that women who conceived within 6 months after miscarriage had higher live birth outcomes with fewer complications. Another study with retrospective cohort design and a population of 30 937 Scottish women who had a SAB and subsequently became pregnant found that women with IPIrate. Conclusion: Decreasing <b>interpregnancy</b> <b>interval</b> to less than 6 months after spontaneous abortion is shown to be associated with a higher live birth rate and fewer complications.
