40|$|Background：Dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus {{contributes}} to injuries of the {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL). However, {{it is unclear how}} the <b>knee</b> rotates during dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus. <b>Knee</b> rotation significantly affects ACL strain. To understand <b>knee</b> rotation during dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus should help the clinician evaluate dynamic alignment. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine how the <b>knee</b> rotates during dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus and whether the <b>knee</b> rotation is affected by toe direction (foot rotation). Methods：Sixteen females performed dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus in three toe directions (neutral, toe-out, and toe-in) while maintaining the <b>knee</b> flexion angle at 30 °. The <b>knee</b> rotation angle was evaluated using a 7 -camera motion analysis system. <b>Knee</b> rotation was compared between the start position and the dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus position, as well as among the three toe directions, using repeated measures ANOVA models. Results：The <b>knee</b> significantly rotated externally in the dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus position compared with the start position in two toe directions (neutral and toe-out). A similar tendency was observed with the toe-in condition. Toe direction significantly affected the <b>knee</b> rotation angle. For toe-out and toe-in conditions, external and internal shifts of <b>knee</b> rotation compared with neutral were observed. Conclusions：The <b>knee</b> rotates externally during dynamic <b>knee</b> valgus, and the <b>knee</b> rotation is affected by toe direction. Clinical Relevance：Because of <b>knee</b> abduction and external rotation, the ACL may impinge on the femoral condyle in the case of dynamic valgus, especially in the toe-out position...|$|R

Common defects of the hind limbs include the same base-wide and base-narrow stances and problems with the feet as the fore limbs, as well as multiple issues with the angle formed by the hock joint being too angled (sickle-hocked), too straight (straight behind) or having an inward deviation (cow-hocked). Feral horses are seldom found with serious conformation problems in the leg, as foals with these defects are generally easy prey for predators.

40|$|Purpose: Poor <b>knee</b> {{function}} after {{anterior cruciate}} ligament reconstruction (ACLR) may {{increase the risk of}} future <b>knee</b> symptoms and <b>knee</b> osteoarthritis via abnormal <b>knee</b> joint loading patterns, particularly during high-impact activity. This study aimed to assess the relationship between poor self-reported or clinically measured <b>knee</b> function and <b>knee</b> moments/vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) in individuals following ACLR. Methods: 61 participants (mean 16. 5 [*]±[*] 3 months following ACLR, 23 women) completed a patient-reported <b>knee</b> function questionnaire and three hop tests (% of uninvolved limb). Participants were divided into satisfactory and poor <b>knee</b> function groups (poor < 85 % patient-reported <b>knee</b> function and/or <[*] 85 % hop test symmetry). The <b>knee</b> biomechanics of both groups were assessed with three-dimensional motion analysis during the stance phase of overland running at self-selected speeds, and the association between <b>knee</b> function and <b>knee</b> moments was assessed using analysis of covariance with running speed as a covariate. Results: Participants with poor <b>knee</b> function (n[*]=[*] 30) ran with significantly smaller peak <b>knee</b> flexion moments (moderate effect size 0. 7, p[*]=[*] 0. 03) and significantly smaller peak vGRFs (large effect size 1. 0, p[*]=[*] 0. 002) compared to those with satisfactory <b>knee</b> function (n[*]=[*] 31). No significant differences were observed for <b>knee</b> adduction and <b>knee</b> external rotation moments or <b>knee</b> kinematics. Conclusion: Individuals following ACLR with poor self-reported <b>knee</b> function and/or hop test performance demonstrate <b>knee</b> moments during running that may be associated with lower <b>knee</b> joint contact forces. These findings provide greater understanding of the relationship between <b>knee</b> biomechanics during running and clinical assessments of <b>knee</b> function. Level of evidence: III.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The peak <b>knee</b> {{adduction}} {{moment is}} a valid proxy for medial <b>knee</b> joint loading. However as it only measures load at one instance of stance, <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse, a measure {{that takes into account}} both the magnitude and duration of the stance phase, may provide more comprehensive information. This study directly compared the abilities of peak <b>knee</b> adduction moment and <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse to distinguish between <b>knee</b> osteoarthritis severities. METHODS: 169 participants with medial <b>knee</b> osteoarthritis completed radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index to assess pain and a three-dimensional gait analysis. Participants were classified using four dichotomous classifications: Kellgren-Lawrence grading, alignment, medial tibiofemoral bone marrow lesions, and pain. FINDINGS: When using Kellgren-Lawrence grade and alignment classifications, the area under the receiver operator curves were significantly greater for <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse than for peak <b>knee</b> adduction moment. Based on analysis of covariance, <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse was significantly different between Kellgren-Lawrence grade and alignment groups while peak <b>knee</b> adduction moment was not significantly different. Both peak <b>knee</b> adduction moment and <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse distinguished between bone marrow lesion severities while neither measure was significantly different between pain severity groups. INTERPRETATIONS: Findings suggest <b>knee</b> adduction moment impulse is more sensitive at distinguishing between disease severities and may provide more comprehensive information on medial <b>knee</b> joint loading.

50|$|The <b>knee</b> has a {{more complex}} {{movement}} pattern compared to the hip. At heel contact the <b>knee</b> extensor and flexor muscles co-contract to provide stability for the <b>knee</b> joint since it is almost maximally extended {{at that point in}} time. Shortly after, as the foot becomes flat on the ground, the <b>knee</b> gradually flexes approximately 10-15 degrees reaching the maximum at about 15% of the gait cycle. This small amount of <b>knee</b> flexion is controlled eccentrically by the <b>knee</b> extensor muscles which serve the purpose of cushioning the rate of loading on the lower-limb and preventing excessive <b>knee</b> flexion. Following through to mid-and terminal stance, the <b>knee</b> gradually extends with concentric activity of the <b>knee</b> extensor muscles and approaches near full extension as heel off occurs (30-40% of gait cycle). At this point the <b>knee</b> flexor muscles concentrically flex the <b>knee</b> again for swing phase. The maximum <b>knee</b> flexion that occurs during swing is about 60 degrees.|$|R
5|$|Dispatch {{is notable}} {{for its use}} of, and the sole {{surviving}} remains of, Fell's Patent <b>Knees.</b> These were a patent innovation from 1839 by Jonathan Fell of Workington, Cumberland, and {{were part of the}} development of the iron and wood composite hull. Ships before this had been built from oak, where the strong curved brackets needed to join the deck into the hull side frames could be found as naturally grown 'knees' from the angles between major branches and the trunk. In the post-Nelsonic era there was a general shortage of shipbuilding timber, particularly oak, one of the few species with strong enough branch attachments to provide <b>knees.</b> Dispatch's hull is of pine, which has weak branches. A number of iron substitutes were developed, Fell's design being one of the later and more advanced forms. It had two advantages over earlier rigid-forged patterns: it provided a degree of flexibility in storms and, most significantly, could be stressed after the hull had been constructed and launched or even loaded, when the hull was under its working load. Together with the diagonal iron strapping, this rendered Dispatch's hull particularly strong and had allowed her to endure at least two collisions.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Knee</b> {{extensor}} {{strength and}} <b>knee</b> extension {{range of motion}} (ROM) are important predictors of physical function in patients with a total <b>knee</b> arthroplasty (TKA). However, {{the relationship between the}} two <b>knee</b> measures remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to examine whether changes in <b>knee</b> extensor strength mediate the association between changes in <b>knee</b> extension ROM and self-report physical function. Methods Data from 441 patients with a TKA were collected preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively. Self-report measure of physical function was assessed by the Short Form 36 (SF- 36) questionnaire. <b>Knee</b> extensor strength was measured by handheld dynamometry and <b>knee</b> extension ROM by goniometry. A bootstrapped cross product of coefficients approach was used to evaluate mediation effects. Results Mediation analyses, adjusted for clinicodemographic measures, revealed that the association between changes in <b>knee</b> extension ROM and SF- 36 physical function was mediated by changes in <b>knee</b> extensor strength. Conclusions In patients with TKA, <b>knee</b> extensor strength mediated the influence of <b>knee</b> extension ROM on physical function. These results suggest that interventions to improve the range of <b>knee</b> extension may be useful in improving <b>knee</b> extensor performance. </p...|$|R
