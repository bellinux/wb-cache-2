5|$|This {{measure of}} <b>elasticity</b> is {{sometimes}} referred to as the own-price <b>elasticity</b> of demand for a good, i.e., the <b>elasticity</b> of demand with respect to the good's own price, in order to distinguish it from the <b>elasticity</b> of demand for that good with respect to the change in the price of some other good, i.e., a complementary or substitute good. The latter type of <b>elasticity</b> measure is called a cross-price <b>elasticity</b> of demand.|$|E
5|$|Breadth of {{definition}} of a good: The broader the {{definition of a}} good (or service), the lower the <b>elasticity.</b> For example, Company X's fish and chips would tend to have a relatively high <b>elasticity</b> of demand if a significant number of substitutes are available, whereas food in general would have an extremely low <b>elasticity</b> of demand because no substitutes exist.|$|E

40|$|Cost {{pass-through}} <b>elasticities</b> {{measure the}} percentage decrease in prices from a percentage cost reduction. For given cost reductions, lower <b>elasticities</b> harm consumers through a lower pass-through to prices. But these same lower <b>elasticities</b> may increase cost-reducing innovation by firms and thereby help consumers by leading to lower prices. To explore this trade-off, pass-through <b>elasticities</b> are first estimated for 253 US manufacturing industries. After this, two second-stage regressions {{that use the}} estimated <b>elasticities</b> are introduced. The first regression finds that higher seller concentration leads to lower pass-through <b>elasticities,</b> whereas the second finds that the lower pass-through <b>elasticities,</b> which accompany higher concentration, lead to higher average annual productivity growth. This means there is a trade-off, and lower <b>elasticities</b> can benefit consumers. ...|$|R
40|$|Estimating {{the degree}} of {{substitution}} between energy and non-energy inputs is the key for any evaluation of environmental and energy policies. Yet, given the variety of substitution <b>elasticities,</b> the central question arises as to which measure would be most appropriate. Apparently, Allen's <b>elasticities</b> of substitution have been the most-used measures in applied production analysis. In line with Frondel (2004), this paper argues that cross-price <b>elasticities</b> are preferable for many practical purposes. This conclusion {{is based on a}} survey of classical substitution measures, such as those from Allen, Morishima, and McFadden. The survey highlights the fact that cross-price <b>elasticities</b> are their essential ingredients.

5|$|If {{one point}} <b>elasticity</b> {{is used to}} model demand changes over a finite range of prices, <b>elasticity</b> is implicitly assumed {{constant}} with respect to price over the finite price range.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an alternative characterization of separability based on <b>elasticities</b> of complementarity. Earlier studies have formulated separability restrictions {{in terms of}} the Allen <b>elasticities</b> of substitution. The Hicks and Antonelli <b>elasticities</b> of complementarity are presented to examine separability of production (utility) and distance functions. Whereas the Allen <b>elasticities</b> of substitution are valid under homothetic separability, the Hicks <b>elasticities</b> of complementarity are a universally relevant measure of separability for the production (utility) function. Separability of meat commodities is tested using the Antonelli <b>elasticities</b> with the consumer's preferences specified with the distance function.

Generally, one finds that the OECD countries have GDP <b>elasticities</b> that are smaller, and price <b>elasticities</b> that are larger (in absolute value). The price <b>elasticities</b> for the low-income Asian countries are more inelastic than for the middle-income Asian countries, and the GDP <b>elasticities</b> are generally more elastic. ...|$|R

5|$|Various {{research}} methods {{are used to}} calculate price elasticities in real life, including analysis of historic sales data, both public and private, and use of present-day surveys of customers' preferences to build up test markets capable of modelling such changes. Alternatively, conjoint analysis (a ranking of users' preferences which can then be statistically analysed) may be used. Approximate estimates of price <b>elasticity</b> can be calculated from the income <b>elasticity</b> of demand, under conditions of preference independence. This approach has been emprirically validated using bundles of goods (e.g. food, healthcare, education, recreation, etc.).|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} <b>elasticity</b> {{of demand for}} a good is {{relatively}} inelastic (-1 < Ed < 0), the percentage change in quantity demanded is smaller than that in price. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue increases, and vice versa.|$|E
40|$|This paper updates {{a review}} {{conducted}} by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 1996 in which the agency evaluated the academic research {{on the effects of}} changes in after-tax wages on labor supply in the U. S. economy. That review concluded that substitution <b>elasticities</b> were larger in absolute value than income <b>elasticities</b> and that the decision to work was more responsive to after-tax wages than was the choice of hours. In this update, we find that for men and single women, estimates of substitution <b>elasticities</b> have increased, and income <b>elasticities</b> still appear to be smaller in absolute value than substitution <b>elasticities.</b> We also find that labor supply <b>elasticities</b> of married women have fallen substantially in the last three decades, although they are still higher than the <b>elasticities</b> of men and unmarried women. Based on our review, the <b>elasticities</b> of broad measures of income (total income less capital gains) from tax return data are in most instances consistent with the labor supply <b>elasticities</b> estimated using survey data. We find little compelling evidence that high-income taxpayers have substantially higher <b>elasticities</b> with respect to their labor input than other taxpayers: While some studies have estimated higher <b>elasticities</b> of broad income among high-income taxpayers, those results appear to reflect those taxpayers’ greater ability to time their income. In contrast, we find evidence that low-income workers have higher <b>elasticities</b> of labor supply than other workers, especially in the component of their labor response that reflects movement {{in and out of the}} workforce...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Countries {{and regions}} within {{countries}} frequently import and export {{from the same}} standard industrial classification (SIC) groupings. In describing international trade, the Armington assumption recognizes that imported goods may substitute imperfectly for domestically produced goods. Imports and domestically produced goods may differ in quality or composition. <b>Elasticities</b> of import substitution have been extensively estimated for international trade but limited information is available on <b>elasticities</b> of substitution for regional imports. One h y-pothesis in the literature is that international trade <b>elasticities</b> {{should be considered as}} lower bounds for regional trade <b>elasticities</b> presumably because of fewer non-price trade restrictions. This research estimates regional <b>elasticities</b> of import substitution for 20 two-digit groupings using commodity trade date in the U. S. The range in <b>elasticities</b> is from 0. 45 to 2. 80 depending on the characteristics of the SIC grouping. These results tend to refute the hypothesis that international trade <b>elasticities</b> are lower bounds for regional trade <b>elasticities</b> for comparable goods. 1...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{estimate}} income <b>elasticities</b> and own- and cross-price <b>elasticities</b> {{for a number}} of categories of goods. The methodology used was proposed by Deaton (1987). Expenditure and quantity data from Household Budget Surveys for Bulgaria are used. The households are geographically separated into clusters. The prices are assumed to be the same within each of the clusters, so that the effects of income and other demographic factors on unit values are determined and the variances and covariances of the measurement errors estimated in the first stage. Then, in the second stage, the spatial price variation between the different clusters is used for the estimation of own- and cross-price <b>elasticities</b> for various categories of goods.
