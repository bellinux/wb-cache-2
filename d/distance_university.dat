40|$|<b>Distance</b> <b>universities</b> {{excel in}} using digital media {{technologies}} for content delivery and collaborative interaction {{to compensate for}} limited face-to-face opportunities. Now that an ever-growing variety of media technologies, devices and services are flooding the market, possession of expertise about the educational opportunities of these technologies is becoming a strategic asset for any education provider. <b>Distance</b> <b>universities</b> may act as informative examples in this regard. This paper discusses how <b>distance</b> <b>universities</b> face {{the challenges of the}} ever-shortening lifespans of these new technologies. We describe some of the disruptive changes effected by the Internet, and discuss the critical factors for adopting and implementing the associated information and communication technologies in education. Although many practical, organisational, pedagogical and financial factors are relevant, this paper focuses on hidden conceptual barriers that are the result of misconceptions about the role and function that technology possesses and that seem to foster education’s intrinsic conservatism. Particularly, the notion of technology instrumentalism, which emphasises the one-sided subservient role of technology, is a widely popular, {{but at the same time}} a naïve, greatly outdated and fallacious view of technology that confuses the discussions and hampers educational innovation. This paper aims to contribute to the removal of these misconceptions by framing technology in a contemporary view that emphasises the enabling role of technology —particularly media technologies— to develop new pedagogical models and to offer new opportunities for augmenting human cognitive performance...|$|R

40|$|Being able {{to compare}} {{effectively}} universities and their courses {{is of particular}} interest {{to a wide range of}} stakeholders – including potential students, policy makers, media organisations, funders, and universities themselves. There does exist a range of university ranking schemes (for example, the Shanghai Academic Ranking of World Universities) that enable some level of comparison but these systems and the metrics that they use are sometimes limited and often controversial. In addition, of particular interest to the Open University, one of the world’s largest online universities, these widely-used ranking systems are designed for face-to-face teaching and learning universities, such that their metrics can be inappropriate for online <b>distance</b> <b>universities.</b> In our paper, we will discuss work that we have undertaken to date towards the establishment of a ranking system that includes indicators of the quality of online distance teaching and learning, to enable the effective comparison of online <b>distance</b> <b>universities.</b> The work reported was completed in the first 8 months of the EU Erasmus+ funded CODUR project with partners from Universitat Oberta De Catalunya (Barcelona, Spain) and Consiglio Nazionale Delle Ricerche (Genova, Italy) ...|$|R
