[...] "I tell you I marked them both last eve, and though I seldom turn {{my mind to}} such follies, I saw the plain tokens of love in every look and gesture of the young springald. Nay, 'twas his countenance that put it into my mind, for I am even too good-natured--over good-natured, Susan Talbot. How now," [...] at some sound below, {{springing}} to the little window and flinging it back, [...] "you lazy idle wenches--what are you doing there? Is my work to stand still while you are toying with yon vile whelp? He is tangling the yarn, don't you see, thou purblind Jane Dacre, with no eyes but for ogling. There! there! Round the leg of the chair, don't you see!" [...] and down flew a shoe, which made the poor dog howl, and his mistress catch him up. [...] "Put him down! put him down this instant! Thomas! Davy! Here, hang him up, I say," [...] cried this over good-natured lady, interspersing her commands with a volley of sixteenth century Billingsgate, and ending by declaring that nothing fared well without her, and hurrying off to pounce down on the luckless damsels who had let their dog play with the <b>embroidery</b> <b>yarn</b> destined to emblazon the tapestry of Chatsworth with the achievements of Juno. The good nature was so far veritable that when she found little harm done, and had vented her wrath in strong language and boxes on the ear, she would forget her sentence upon the poor little greyhound, which Mrs. Jane Dacre had hastily conveyed out of sight during her transit downstairs. Susan was thus, to her great relief, released for the present, for guests came in before my Lady had fully completed her objurgations on her ladies, the hour of noon was nigh at hand, sounds in the court betokened {{the return of the}} huntsmen, and Susan effected her escape to her own sober old palfrey--glad that she would at least be able to take counsel with her husband on this most inconvenient proposition.|$|E

50|$|A {{trademark}} is a sign, or {{a combination}} of signs, that distinguishes the goods or services of one company from those of another. Such signs may use words, letters, numerals, pictures, shapes and colors, or any combination thereof. An increasing number of countries also allow for the registration of less traditional forms of trademarks, such as three-dimensional signs (like the Coca-Cola bottle or Toblerone chocolate bar), audible signs (sounds such as the roar of the lion at the beginning of films produced by MGM), or olfactory signs (such as the smell of a particular type of motor oil or <b>embroidery</b> <b>yarn).</b> However, many countries have set limits on what may be registered as a trademark, generally allowing only signs that are visually perceptible or can be represented graphically. Trademarks are used on goods or in connection with the market - ing of goods or services. The trademark may appear not only on the goods themselves but also on the container or packaging in which the goods are marketed. When used in connection with the sale of goods or services, the sign may appear in advertisements, for example, in newspapers, on television or in shop windows.|$|E

50|$|Soon, {{with the}} boys eager help, the Stones had gone into series {{production}} of <b>embroidery</b> <b>yarns,</b> as the product which would stretch the dyes and return the maximum in income. Karl Edelman was impressed and Stoner had a new life partner, one who had a ruthless business savvy that he'd never own. As the story closes, Stoner is recalling the history early organic dyes {{leading up to the}} Mauve Decade, when coal-tar dyes such as Perkin's mauve were developed and generated huge fortunes for the ready market existed in the mindset of status-conscious Europeans of the day, as they did in 1631-32 Germans.

Splitting the profits bothered Stoner not a bit. They would be huge.|$|R
40|$|Introduction Maya weavers of Guatemala {{are well}} known for their {{beautiful}} backs trap and treadle-loomed cloth, which they create for clothing and related garments and for sale, {{both within and outside}} Guatemala. Backstrap weaving, mainly a woman 2 ̆ 7 s occupation done in the home, has an ancient history over two millennia, although there are few extant examples of the weavings of the ancient Maya due to climatic conditions (Figure 1). The process, however, was documented in ceramic art, and the tradition of handwoven clothing can be seen in monumental stone carvings, murals, and also in ceramic art. Today weavers purchase the yarn called mish already spun and dyed in nearby shops. A backstrap loom is only sticks and a batten, hence it is often called a stick loom. <b>Embroidery</b> <b>yarn,</b> which is used in supplementary weft brocading often mistaken for embroidery, comes from many parts of the world. I have samples in my collection from France, England, Hungary, Germany, Japan, China, and elsewhere. These are purchased in regional markets such as Chichicastenango and Antigua. Men generally produce yardage on treadle looms for women 2 ̆ 7 s skirts and other items for sale. Following up on field work done in 1994 that focused on four weaving cooperatives in Guatemala, my current research looks at two successful textile projects. Colibri, a shop in Antigua, and Maya Traditions, with headquarters in San Francisco, that are not laden with the bureaucratic cooperative structure that became cumbersome, corrupt, and eventually in some cases completely broke down. Within these currently successful groups, decision-making is a communal act responsive to group dynamics and increasing self esteem. Two non-indigenous women, both North Americans, started these groups and continue to advise them and market their products. Learning to modify traditional design layouts, shapes, colors, and products, weavers are creating commodities that can be sold within Guatemala and in the world markets abroad. As a result, these women are adding to their family incomes, as well as gaining linguistic and leadership skills not available to them in the past. In order to discuss the ongoing and successful projects, I want to provide some background about cooperatives in the 1980 s and early 1990 s. In addition I will discuss some of the notions of commodification or commoditization (neither word is in Webster 2 ̆ 7 s Third New International Dictionary) that were buzz words in anthropological research on world markets and textile production as put forth by June Nash and others in Crafts in the World Market (1993) and Annette B. Weiner and Jane Schneider and others in Cloth and Human Experience (1989). Brenda Rosenbaum and Liliana Goldin have also addressed the remaking of Maya artisan production in Guatemala with conclusions similar to mine (1997) ...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{relative}} and absolute humidity {{is essential for}} industrious, in-home, healthcare {{and a number of}} other applications. Although there is a large variety of a different type of commercial sensors, some specific applications might require solutions that flexible, cover large-areas, relatively low-cost and simple in production. Smart textiles and sensing properties may provide solutions for areas facing challenging requirements, whether bring improvement to some aspects in construction, operation, physical or other properties. The current report presents a preliminary study on the concept of a textile humidity sensor, design and development issues cohered with further application particularities. Several designs of the sensor have been implemented by conventional embroidery on a textile substrate using conductive yarns. In order to achieve efficient operation of the sensor with available materials and technologies, investigations on the choice of the appropriate design of the prototype including the specific pattern for the capacitor <b>embroidery,</b> <b>yarns</b> and substrate materials, have been performed and solutions for improving the initial prototype of the sensor are suggested...|$|R

50|$|The {{traditional}} costume for khaleegy {{is composed}} of 2 pieces or dresses. The bottom or shift dress is molded to the figure and is made of a sturdier fabric than the top dress. It is usually not adorned or embroidered and when it is, the ornaments are very simple. The colors often contrast with the ones of the top dress to create nice color combinations. The top dress is a long, wide, rectangular tunic-like dress called a thobe. It is traditionally made of sheer silk to create a translucent effect and let {{a hint of the}} shift dress be seen, it is heavily embroidered from the center and the extreme wide shoulder parts with beads, <b>yarn</b> <b>embroidery</b> or anything shiny. The neckline is also beautifully ornamented. The Thobe can be any color, but very bright solid tones are the most used. Additional accessories for the costume include necklaces, bracelets, big shiny earrings and the most important one: the woman´s long and well cared hair. It is danced barefoot.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{a number}} of {{research}} projects and patents have proposed to apply <b>embroidery</b> of conductive <b>yarn</b> to build electric circuits on textile substrates. To contact electronic modules or components to these circuits, embroidery itself was applied as a contacting method. Thereby, the embroidery needle is stitching through a conductive pad on an electronic substrate and is laying the conductive thread over this pad. The yarn and the pad establish an electrical contact. However, until today this contacting technology based on embroidery has not been adopted by the industry since reliability issues during stress were reported by different researchers. Yet, neither these failure phenomena were investigated comprehensively, nor was it attempted to understand their cause. This inhibited potential improvements to make these embroidered contacts reliable. Furthermore, the lack of alternative technologies for a reliable and volume producible contacting of embroidered circuits with electronic components or modules kept embroidered circuits from evolving to actual products. Therefore, this thesis primarily develops {{an understanding of the}} contact mechanism underlying embroidered contacts, and develops a theory that explains the failure phenomena. Secondarily the thesis overcomes these reliability issues by improving these contacts and by finding alternatives. The ultimate goal beyond this thesis is a volume producible contacting process. Therefore, this thesis looks mainly at machine embroidered contacts...|$|R
