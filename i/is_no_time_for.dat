We can deny our {{heritage}} and our history, but we cannot escape responsibility for the result. There is no way for a citizen of a republic to abdicate his responsibilities. As a nation we have come into our full inheritance at a tender age. We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues {{to exist in the}} world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the campaign, the Liberals focused their attacks on Clark's {{perceived}} inexperience. Their advertisements declared [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> on-the-job training", and [...] "We need tough leadership to keep Canada growing. A leader must be a leader." [...] Clark played into their hands by appearing bumbling and unsure in public.|$|E
2500|$|The New York Times {{editorial}} board stated that such {{fears of a}} coup by President Maduro [...] "appear to be a diversion strategy by a maniacal statesman who is unable {{to deal with the}} dismal state of his country’s economy and the rapidly deteriorating quality of life despite having the world’s largest oil reserves". The allegations made by the government were called by David Smilde of the Washington Office on Latin America as a form of unity, with Smilde saying, [...] "When you talk about conspiracies, it's basically a way of rallying the troops. It's a way of saying 'this <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> dissent'".|$|E
2500|$|Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor of New York City, New York. Giuliani {{questioned}} Obama's {{judgment and}} overall experience. He said, [...] "John [...] has been tested. Barack Obama has not. Tough times require strong leadership, and this <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> on-the-job training." [...] He {{also said that}} Obama and Democrats [...] "are {{in a state of}} denial" [...] about the threat of terrorism to the U.S., while McCain can confront and defeat [...] "anything that terrorists do to us". He further said that Obama is without a record of leadership: [...] "He's the least-experienced candidate for President of the United States in at least the last 100 years." [...] The former Mayor praised Palin as [...] "one of the most successful governors in America—and the most popular... She already has more executive experience than the entire Democratic ticket." ...|$|E

2500|$|In SN2 reactions, {{there are}} a few {{conditions}} that affect the rate of the reaction. [...] First of all, the 2 in SN2 implies that there are two concentrations of substances that affect the rate of reaction: substrate and nucleophile. [...] The rate equation for this reaction would be Rate=k. [...] For a SN2 reaction, an aprotic solvent is best, such as acetone, DMF, or DMSO. [...] Aprotic solvents do not add protons (H+) ions into solution; if protons were present in SN2 reactions, they would react with the nucleophile and severely limit the reaction rate. [...] Since this reaction occurs in one step, steric effects drive the reaction speed. In the intermediate step, the nucleophile is 180 degrees from the leaving group and the stereochemistry is inverted as the nucleophile bonds to make the product. [...] Also, because the intermediate is partially bonded to the nucleophile and leaving group, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the substrate to rearrange itself: the nucleophile will bond to the same carbon that the leaving group was attached to. [...] A final factor that affects reaction rate is nucleophilicity; the nucleophile must attack an atom other than a hydrogen.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Apatow {{served as}} {{producer}} for the biblical comedy film Year one, starring Jack Black and Michael Cera, {{and directed by}} Harold Ramis; the film was not well received. He also released his third directorial feature on July 31 that same year, titled Funny People. Apatow wrote the film, which starred Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen {{as a pair of}} standup comedians, one of whom has a terminal illness. Other co-stars included his wife Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, who was a comedic actor in Australia before appearing in American films. The film contained more dramatic elements than Apatow's previous directorial efforts. Although the film was not financially successful (grossing $54 million domestically), the critical reception was primarily positive, with David Denby of New Yorker Magazine including the film on his top ten films of 2009, calling Funny People [...] "a serious comedy about a funny man's brush with death" [...] and stating that the film [...] "is Apatow's richest, most complicated movie yet—a summing up of his feelings about comedy and its relation to the rest of existence." [...] The New York Times critic A.O. Scott stated in a piece reflecting on summer films of 2009 that Funny People was [...] "a movie about growing up, feeling sad, facing death—a long, serious film whose subject is the challenge of maturity. Which may be why, {{in the face of a}} softish opening weekend, various interpreters of box office data were quick to declare Funny People a flop. The summer <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> grown-ups." ...|$|E
