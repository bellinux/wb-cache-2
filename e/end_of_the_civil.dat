5|$|With the two {{remaining}} guns removed to Fort Corcoran for storage and the garrison sent home, the fort was left abandoned. Due to its proximity to Washington and the large influx of freed blacks to the city that followed the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, the fort became residence to many squatters, {{most of whom were}} African-American.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> {{conflict}} came a small lull {{in fighting}} between the expanding Ottomans and Byzantines. In 1361 Didymoteichon {{fell to the}} Turks. Orhan's successor, Murad I was more concerned with his Anatolian positions. However, just like Alp Arslan of the Seljuk Turks, Murad I left the taking of Byzantine territory to his vassals with Philippopolis falling after major campaigning between 1363–4 and Adrianople succumbing to the Ottomans in 1369.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, the United States had {{experienced}} panics of varying severity. Economists Charles Calomiris and Gary Gorton rate the worst panics as those leading to widespread bank suspensions—the panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907, and a suspension in 1914. Widespread suspensions were forestalled through coordinated actions during both the 1884 and the 1890 panics. A bank crisis in 1896, {{in which there}} was a perceived need for coordination, is also sometimes classified as a panic.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{surviving}} {{church building}} in the town is Orrick Chapel, built between 1866 and 1869 {{as the home of}} an African Methodist Episcopal congregation. Missionaries from this first independent black denomination came South after the war to aid freedmen and plant new congregations; they attracted hundreds of thousands of new members. This church replaced an earlier Methodist chapel constructed in the late 1850s; it was razed by Union troops during the winter months of 1864–1865 near the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War.|$|E
5|$|After {{just half}} a year as vice president, Arthur {{found himself in the}} {{executive}} mansion due to the assassination of his predecessor. To the surprise of reformers, Arthur took up the cause of reform, though it had once led to his expulsion from office. He signed the Pendleton Act into law and strongly enforced its provisions. He gained praise for his veto of a Rivers and Harbors Act that would have appropriated federal funds in a manner he thought excessive. He presided over the rebirth of the United States Navy, but was criticized for failing to alleviate the federal budget surplus, which had been accumulating since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the damage}} caused by the cannon, the castle escaped the slighting, or {{deliberate}} damaging, that occurred to many other castles at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war. Nonetheless, Richard Prater was forbidden to return to the castle, despite his promises to support Parliament, and his son, George Prater, only recovered Nunney from its interim owners after Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660. The castle declined and was sold by the Praters to William Whitchurch around 1700. During the 18th century the building was still in a reasonable condition and in 1789 an order was received make it ready to receive French prisoners, although it is unlikely they ever arrived.|$|E

5|$|Henry Martin Tupper D.D. (April 11, 1831 – November 12, 1893) was a Baptist {{minister}} who founded Shaw University in Raleigh, North Carolina. Beginning with bible and literacy classes in December 1865, {{it was the}} first university established for African Americans following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war, and the oldest historically black college and university (HBCU) in the Southern United States, as well as one of the oldest co-educational universities in the country. When the institute moved into a new building in 1871, it was renamed as Shaw Collegiate Institute in honor of a major donor. Tupper served as the University's first president from its founding until his death in 1893.|$|E
5|$|In March 1864, Dixon {{accompanied}} Kentucky Governor Thomas E. Bramlette and John Marshall Harlan, the state's attorney general, to {{an audience}} with President Lincoln to protest the recruitment of blacks {{into the ranks of}} the Union Army. The governor eventually agreed to allow the practice, but only when whites failed to meet their draft quotas. Since recruitment of blacks had been taking place in the Commonwealth for more than two months already, the concession {{was little more than a}} face-saving gesture by Bramlette. Following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, Dixon retired from public life. He died in Henderson on April 23, 1876, and is buried in Fernwood Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} not all {{indigenous}} units were disbanded at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war period (31BC). Some of the more experienced units were kept in existence to complement the legions, and became {{the core of the}} standing auxiliary forces that developed in the Julio-Claudian period. During the early rule of Augustus (27BC onwards), the corps of regular Auxilia was created. It was clearly inspired by the Latin forces of the pre-Social War Republic, as a corps of non-citizen troops parallel to the legions. But there were fundamental differences, the same as between Republican and Augustan legions. The Latin forces of the Republic were made up of part-time conscripts in units that would be raised and disbanded for and after particular campaigns. The Augustan Auxilia were mainly volunteer professionals serving in permanent units.|$|E

5|$|Pompey's death {{did not see}} the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> wars since {{initially}} Caesar's enemies were manifold and Pompey's supporters {{continued to}} fight on after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army when his former commander Titus Labienus, who had defected to the Pompeians several years earlier, defeated him at the Battle of Ruspina. However, after this low point Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of Metellus Scipio in the Battle of Thapsus, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the Battle of Munda in Iberia. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.|$|E
5|$|Runyon {{was built}} {{immediately}} after the entry of Union forces into Virginia on May 24, 1861, on the land of James Roach, a Washington building contractor. Fort Runyon was the largest fort in the ring of defenses that protected Washington during the Civil War and was named after Brigadier General Theodore Runyon, commander of the Fourth Division of the Army of Northeastern Virginia during the First Battle of Bull Run. Union soldiers garrisoned the fort until its dismantling following the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War in 1865. Today, {{no trace of the}} fort remains on the site, which is now exit 9 on Interstate 395, though a historical marker has been constructed by the Arlington Historical Society.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Civil</b> War, {{stories of}} the Confederate gold and its vast wealth have been told and retold. One of those stories {{involves}} Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander's neighbors in Wilkes county and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander's help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, had been thrown into his yard in Washington.|$|E

5|$|Since the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war in 1970, some ethnic {{violence}} has persisted. There has subsequently been {{a period of}} relative harmony since the Federal Government introduced tough new measures against religious violence in all affected parts of the country. The 2002 Miss World pageant was moved from Abuja to London {{in the wake of}} violent protests in the Northern part of the country that left more than 100people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after Muslims in the country reacted in anger to comments made by a newspaper reporter. Rioters in Kaduna killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital.|$|E
5|$|With the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war, Henry's {{government}} {{faced the}} task of rebuilding royal authority across {{large parts of the}} country. By the end of 1217 many former rebels were routinely ignoring instructions from the centre, and even Henry's loyalist supporters jealously maintained their independent control over royal castles. Illegally constructed fortifications, called adulterine castles, had sprung up across much of the country. The network of county sheriffs had collapsed, and with it the ability to raise taxes and collect royal revenues. The powerful Welsh Prince Llywelyn posed a major threat in Wales and along the Welsh Marches.|$|E
5|$|A {{civil war}} between Stephen and the Empress Matilda soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to rise up against Stephen, seizing Ludlow Castle. Stephen responded by taking an army into the Welsh Marches, where he {{attempted}} to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, Joce de Dinan, to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them. Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught on a hook thrown over the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained {{that he was the}} rightful owner of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself. Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around a few years before the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>civil</b> war in 1153. He ultimately left for the Levant, leaving Ludlow in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, and then, after Robert's death, his younger son, Hugh de Lacy.|$|E
