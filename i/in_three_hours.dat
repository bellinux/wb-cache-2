5|$|Miller {{started the}} 1955–56 season, which was purely domestic, with 164 against Queensland in Brisbane. On the final day, Miller set the hosts 275 for victory <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> He {{lengthened}} the innings break by seven minutes, by remonstrating with officials to pause the {{match for the}} running of the Melbourne Cup. They agreed and the match was stopped for 13 minutes for the race. Queensland lost seven wickets but held on for a draw, aided by the 20 minutes lost by Miller's love of horseracing.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps {{made it possible to}} clear a passage in two hours.|$|E

5|$|Australia won the toss and Barnes and Morris put on 136 for {{the opening}} stand before the latter fell for 65. Barnes and Bradman then added 207 for the second wicket. Barnes' 176 came in 255 minutes and Bradman made 146 in 165 minutes. After Bradman {{departed}} at 403/3, wickets began to fall more regularly, but Hassett held up his end and made 110, while Tallon remained unbeaten on 50. Surrey's Test paceman Alec Bedser took 4/104. On the second afternoon, Surrey scored 141 runs <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> in their first innings. Johnson took 5/53 and Laurie Fishlock carried his bat for 81 not out, but received little support, the next highest scores being 15 and 10. Australia enforced the follow on and took two early wickets before stumps on the second day. They made continual inroads on the final day, and Surrey were all out for 195 to complete an innings win. Johnston took 4/40 and Johnson 3/40.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{defeated}} Murray in {{four sets}} <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours</b> and 44 minutes, {{to capture a}} record equalling seventh Wimbledon championship, and a record breaking seventeenth Major title. The victory was also historic as it caused Federer to depose Djokovic as world No. 1 and break Sampras' record of 286 weeks at the summit of men's tennis (Federer had been just one week short when he lost the number one ranking in June 2010).

The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships. This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months.|$|E

Following {{a summer of}} tropical moisture in Florida, Henri brought more heavy rainfall to the saturated state, peaking at 9.09in (230mm) in Hialeah in the southeast portion of the state. Two other areas experienced over 7in (180mm), though most areas received only light rainfall. In Hernando County, a stationary thunderstorm dropped over 5in (125mm) of rain in around an hour. It caused a rapid flooding of roads, though quickly retreated. Damage was minor, {{due to lack of}} many homes in the area. A feeder band in Charlotte County dropped 7in (180mm) of rain <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours,</b> flooding numerous streets and homes. Throughout Florida, damage was minimal, and there were no deaths. However, lightning from a feeder band injured a man in Lee County, while an indirect injury occurred from a car crash due to hydroplaning.|$|E

5|$|Sale {{was never}} officially {{evacuated}} during the war, and even received families from evacuated areas, {{although it was}} not considered far enough from likely targets to be an official destination for evacuees. The town's proximity to Manchester, an industrial centre directed towards the war effort, did result in a number of bombing raids. Incendiaries dropped on Sale in September 1940 caused no casualties, but did damage a house. In a bombing incident the following November, four people were injured and a school was damaged; on 22 December 1940, twelve people were injured by bombs. On the night of 23 December, much of Manchester suffered heavy bombing in {{what became known as the}} Manchester Blitz. Six hundred incendiary bombs were dropped on Sale <b>in</b> <b>three</b> <b>hours.</b> There were no injuries, but Sale Town Hall was severely damaged. On 3 August 1943, at 11:50pm, a Wellington Bomber on a training exercise crashed in Walton Park in the south-west of the town.
