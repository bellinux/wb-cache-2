Air Canada Flight 627, which had departed a few minutes prior to Flight 663, also radioed news of an explosion in the water.|$|E
5|$|One tourism {{activity}} {{unique to the}} Arctic North is iceberg watching. During the summer season of April to July, {{it is possible to}} watch icebergs moving down rivers while the ice around them melts. In addition, watching the floe edge is also a popular activity due to wildlife movement during this time. Whales can often be seen swimming metres from the ice, polar bears can be observed swimming briefly in the <b>icy</b> <b>water</b> and amphibious animals often bring themselves up onto dry land or onto the ice to sunbathe.|$|E
5|$|The 22.5-foot (6.85m) James Caird was {{launched}} on 24 April 1916. The {{success of the}} voyage depended on the pin-point accuracy of Worsley's navigation, using observations {{that would have to}} be made in the most unfavourable of conditions. The prevailing wind was helpfully north-west, but the heavy sea conditions quickly soaked everything in <b>icy</b> <b>water.</b> Soon ice settled thickly on the boat, making her ride sluggishly. On 5 May a north-westerly gale almost caused the boat's destruction as it faced what Shackleton described as the largest waves he had seen in twenty-six years at sea. On 8 May South Georgia was sighted, after a 14-day battle with the elements that had driven the boat party to their physical limits. Two days later, after a prolonged struggle with heavy seas and hurricane-force winds to the south of the island, the party struggled ashore at King Haakon Bay.|$|E

5|$|The Sanjan {{inscription}} {{states the}} horses of Govinda III drank the <b>icy</b> <b>water</b> of the Himalayan stream and his war elephants tasted the sacred {{waters of the}} Ganges River. Amoghavarsha I, eulogised by contemporary Arab traveller Sulaiman as one among the four great emperors of the world, succeeded Govinda III to the throne and ruled during an important cultural period that produced landmark writings in Kannada and Sanskrit. The benevolent development of Jain religion was a hallmark of his rule. Because of his religious temperament, {{his interest in the}} arts and literature and his peace-loving nature, he has been compared to emperor Ashoka. The rule of Indra III in the tenth century enhanced the Rashtrakuta position as an imperial power as they conquered and held Kannauj again. Krishna III followed Indra III to the throne in 939. A patron of Kannada literature and a powerful warrior, his reign marked the submission of the Paramara of Ujjain in the north and Cholas in the south.|$|E

The story, however, has been viewed with skepticism by some historians, pointing out that the German chronicler Jacob von Stählin is the only source for the story, and it seems unlikely that no one else would have documented such an act of heroism. This, plus the interval of time between these actions and Peter's death seems to preclude any direct link.|$|E
25|$|The less usual Wirehaired Vizsla is a {{completely}} separate breed from its more commonly seen smooth-coated cousin. The Wirehaired Vizsla {{was developed in the}} 1930s, initially by Vasas Jozsef, owner of the Csabai vizsla kennel along with Gresznarik Laszlo, who owned the de Selle German Wirehaired Pointer kennel. Their aim was to produce a dog that combined the color of the Vizsla with a heavier coat, and a more substantial frame, better suited for working in cold weather and retrieving from <b>icy</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the middle}} of the battle, as dawn was about to break, the allied fleet had the upper hand and half of Shimazu's fleet were either sunk or captured. It was said that Yoshihiro's {{flagship}} was sunk and that he was clinging to a piece of wood in the <b>icy</b> <b>water.</b> Japanese ships came to his rescue, pulling him to safety. During the course of the battle, the ships fought from the west end of the strait all the way across to the east end, almost to the open water. The Japanese sustained heavy damage and began to retreat along the south coast of Namhae Island, towards Pusan.|$|E

A watching bystander, Congressional Budget Office assistant Lenny Skutnik, stripped off his coat and boots, and in short sleeves, dove into the <b>icy</b> <b>water</b> and swam out to successfully pull her to shore. The helicopter then proceeded to where Felch had fallen, and paramedic Gene Windsor stepped out onto the helicopter skid and grabbed her by the clothing to lift her onto the skid with him, bringing her to shore. When the helicopter crew returned for Williams, the wreckage he was strapped into had rolled slightly, submerging him—according to the coroner, Williams was the only passenger to die by drowning.

25|$|In the movie, Snake Eyes' origin is rebooted, {{with him}} being an {{abandoned}} 10-year-old child who {{found his way}} to the home of Arashikage Clan. He battles the young Thomas Arashikage (Storm Shadow), who attacks him for stealing food. However, the orphan's natural ability to fight impresses Thomas's uncle, the Hard Master, who gives Snake Eyes his name, while bringing him under his wing. While Snake Eyes would initially lose to Thomas, Snake Eyes eventually surpasses Thomas and gains the favor of the Hard Master, becoming recognized as Hard Master's top student. Angered at Hard Master choosing Snake Eyes over him, Thomas appears to kill the Hard Master off-screen, and is then seen running off in midst of the chaos. Since then, Snake Eyes has chosen to take a vow of silence. Learning that Thomas, now known as Storm Shadow, is a member of Cobra, Snake Eyes fights him, before stabbing him and allowing him to fall into <b>icy</b> <b>water</b> at Cobra's Arctic base, leaving him for dead. Snake Eyes returns to The Pit with the surviving members of G.I. Joe.|$|E

500|$|Apart from frozen remains, {{the only}} soft tissue known {{is from a}} {{specimen}} that was preserved in a petroleum seep in Starunia, Poland. Frozen remains of woolly mammoths {{have been found in}} the northern parts of Siberia and Alaska, with far fewer finds in the latter. Such remains are mostly found above the Arctic Circle, in permafrost. It appears that soft tissue was less likely to be preserved between 30,000 and 15,000 years ago, perhaps because the climate was milder during that period. Most specimens have partially degraded prior to discovery, due to exposure or to being scavenged. This [...] "natural mummification" [...] required the animal to have been buried rapidly in liquid or semi-solids such as silt, mud and <b>icy</b> <b>water,</b> which then froze.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{confirmed}} that the possibility was open for Jackie Mason to reprise his role as Rabbi Krustofski in dreams or flashbacks, and that Krusty would become a more generous character {{in the knowledge that}} his father admired his work.

500|$|The {{hours before}} the battle served as the {{inspiration}} for the painting Washington Crossing the Delaware by German American artist Emanuel Leutze. [...] The image in the painting, in which Washington stands majestic in his boat as it crosses the Delaware River, is generally believed to be more symbolic than historically accurate. [...] The waters of the river were icy and treacherous, and the flag Monroe holds was not created until six months after the battle. In addition, contrary to the painting, the crossing occurred before dawn. [...] On the other hand, Fischer argues that because the crossing took place in a storm, people may have stood to avoid sitting in <b>icy</b> <b>water</b> in the boats. [...] Because of its emotional content, the painting has become an icon of American history.|$|E

500|$|The ship {{began to}} flood immediately, with water pouring in at an {{estimated}} rate of [...] per second, fifteen times faster than it could be pumped out. Second Engineer J. H.

500|$|Militia {{companies}} {{to the north}} were alerted to the British movement early in the day, and some marched for Bound Brook, New Jersey.

[...] In all about 400 New Jersey militia and 50 Pennsylvania militia formed under Brigadier General Philemon Dickinson to dispute the British action. [...] While detailed accounts of their movements are sketchy, Dickinson apparently divided his forces, sending one force to meet {{the front of the}} British wagon train, while a second moved to flank them. [...] Both of these forces forded one of the rivers, wading in <b>icy</b> <b>water</b> that was waist deep. [...] One successfully surprised the British wagon train in the lane near the mill, before it reached the main road and the bridge toward New Brunswick; their fire struck horses from the first wagon.
