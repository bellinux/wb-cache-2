2500|$|Worldwide, {{industry}} uses bulk material, like coal, as {{a source}} of energy or as a raw material for production processes. <b>Intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> (for example stockpiles) are required to decouple the (discontinuous) supply of raw materials from the (continuous) production process. Large quality fluctuations of the material properties can occur due to the geographical origin of the raw materials. This means that processes using these raw materials have to deal with these fluctuations in order to produce products with a constant quality. The fluctuations can be dealt with in two ways: ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{scheduling}} batch (i. e., discontinuous), continuous, and semicontinuous production in process industries (e. g., chemical, pharmaceutical, or metal casting industries) where <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> and renewable resources (processing units and manpower) of limited capacity {{have to be}} observed. First, different storage configurations typical of process industries are discussed. Second, a basic scheduling problem covering the three above production modes is presented. Third, (exact and truncated) branch-and-bound methods for the basic scheduling problem and the special case of batch scheduling are proposed and subjected to an experimental performance analysis. The solution approach presented is flexible and in principle simple, and it can (approximately) solve relatively large problem instances with sufficient accuracy...|$|E
40|$|In Japan, many {{facilities}} are constructed along the seashore {{and the nuclear}} power plants which need cooling water are also constructed along the seashore. In addition, spent fuel <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> are planned to be constructed in the Sea of Japan coast area. In pursuing sea salt aerosol-induced corrosion research, {{it was necessary to}} perform corrosion tests under a certain set of environmental conditions since corrosion of structures was known to be highly sensitive to environmental factors. To improve the corrosive condition, we considered to use filter. The definition of filter goodness on this study is that the amount of sea salt reduction is large as compared with pressure loss. From this view point, we carried out the filter performance test. From this tests result, we confirmed that our selected filters have good performance...|$|E

50|$|When {{a nuclear}} fuel {{assembly}} {{is prepared for}} onsite storage, it is dried {{and moved to a}} spent nuclear fuel shipping cask with scores of other assemblies. Then it sits on a concrete pad {{for a number of years}} waiting for an <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facility</b> or reprocessing. The transportation of radiation-damaged cladding is tricky, because it is so fragile. After being removed from the reactor and cooling down in the spent fuel pool, the hydrides within the cladding of an assembly reorient themselves so that they radially point out from the fuel, rather than circularly in the direction of the hoop stress. This puts the fuel in a situation so that when it is moved to its final resting place, if the cask were to fall, the cladding would be so weak it could break and release the spent fuel pellets inside the cask.|$|R
30|$|V 2 G {{refers to}} the {{interaction}} between EVs and the power grid. The basic idea of V 2 G is to use EV batteries as the <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> for providing services to the electric power system when EVs are parked [7]. The concept of V 2 G was first introduced in 1997 [8], and this transformed our original understanding {{of the influence of}} EVs on the electric power system. In the beginning, some worried that the increment of EVs would bring a big challenge to the electric power system in terms of power provision, system stability and so on [9, 10]; however, from the perspective of V 2 G, EVs are not a burden but a beneficial resource. The grid system could become more economic than currently if the potential of V 2 G services is exploited properly; in the meantime EV owners and GSO could each obtain benefit, not only from the extra revenue but also by enhancing the efficiency of asset usage.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the ongoing}} trend towards {{increased}} product variety, fast-moving consumer goods such as food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, and chemicals are typically manufactured through so-called make-and-pack processes. These processes consist of a make stage, a pack stage, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facilities</b> that decouple these two stages. In operations scheduling, complex technological constraints must be considered, e. g., non-identical parallel processing units, sequence-dependent changeovers, batch splitting, no-wait restrictions, material transfer times, minimum storage times, and finite storage capacity. The short-term scheduling problem is to compute a production schedule such that a given demand for products is fulfilled, all technological constraints are met, and the production makespan is minimised. A production schedule typically comprises 500 – 1500 operations. Due to the problem size {{and complexity of the}} technological constraints, the performance of known mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations and heuristic approaches is often insufficient. We present a hybrid method consisting of three phases. First, the set of operations is divided into several subsets. Second, these subsets are iteratively scheduled using a generic and flexible MILP formulation. Third, a novel critical path-based improvement procedure is applied to the resulting schedule. We develop several strategies for the integration of the MILP model into this heuristic framework. Using these strategies, high-quality feasible solutions to large-scale instances can be obtained within reasonable CPU times using standard optimisation software. We have applied the proposed hybrid method to a set of industrial problem instances and found that the method outperforms state-of-the-art methods...|$|E
40|$|An Advanced Planning System (APS) offers {{support at}} all {{planning}} levels along {{the supply chain}} while observing limited resources. We consider an APS for process industries (e. g. chemical and pharmaceutical industries) consisting of the modules network design (for long–term decisions), supply network planning (for medium–term decisions), and detailed production scheduling (for short–term decisions). For each module, we outline the decision problem, discuss the specifi cs of process industries, and review state–of–the–art solution approaches. For the module detailed production scheduling, a new solution approach is proposed {{in the case of}} batch production, which can solve much larger practical problems than the methods known thus far. The new approach decomposes detailed production scheduling for batch production into batching and batch scheduling. The batching problem converts the primary requirements for products into individual batches, where the work load is to be minimized. We formulate the batching problem as a nonlinear mixed–integer program and transform it into a linear mixed–binary program of moderate size, which can be solved by standard software. The batch scheduling problem allocates the batches to scarce resources such as processing units, workers, and <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facilities,</b> where some regular objective function like the makespan is to be minimized. The batch scheduling problem is modelled as a resource–constrained project scheduling problem, which can be solved by an efficient truncated branch–and–bound algorithm developed recently. The performance of the new solution procedures for batching and batch scheduling is demonstrated by solving several instances of a case study from process industries...|$|E

40|$|During photosynthesis, part of {{the fixed}} carbon is {{directed}} into the synthesis of transitory starch, which serves as an <b>intermediate</b> carbon <b>storage</b> <b>facility</b> in chloroplasts. This transitory starch is mobilized during the night. Increasing evidence indicates that the main route of starch breakdown proceeds by way of hydrolytic enzymes and results in glucose formation. This pathway requires a glucose translocator to mediate the export of glucose from the chloroplasts. We have reexamined the kinetic properties of the plastidic glucose translocator and, using a differential labeling procedure, have identified the glucose translocator {{as a component of}} the inner envelope membrane. Peptide sequence information derived from this protein was used to isolate cDNA clones encoding a putative plastidic glucose translocator from spinach, potato, tobacco, Arabidopsis, and maize. We also present the molecular characterization of a candidate for a hexose transporter of the plastid envelope membrane. This transporter, initially characterized more than 20 years ago, is closely related to the mammalian glucose transporter GLUT family and differs from all other plant hexose transporters that have been characterized to date...|$|R
40|$|The Swedish Centre for Nuclear Technology (Svenskt Kärntekniskt Centrum, SKC) is a {{national}} initiative to perform industry relevant research at Swedish universities, and to support dedicated education of direct use to the Swedish nuclear industry. SKC has been the meeting point between industry and academia for 25 years, and has coped with varying needs from industry and political situations. The present situation in the Nordic countries is split: Sweden plans to shut down four out of ten reactors by 2020, while Finland is planning and constructing new reactors. Even without a strong signal to construct new reactors in Sweden, the need for nuclear competence will stay, as we have challenges {{in front of us}} to operate and dismantle power plants, operate the <b>intermediate</b> <b>storage</b> <b>facility</b> CLAB in Oskarshamn, and to build and fill the final repositories in Forsmark. The education supported by the SKC at the selected universities will facilitate possible recruitment for nuclear installations. The funding body of SKC consists of all the Swedish Nuclear Power Plants (NPP) situated in Forsmark (three BWRs), Oskarshamn (three BWRs) and Ringhals (one BWR and three PWRs), and the nuclear fuel manufacturer (Westinghouse), while the main research and education is carried out at Chalmers, KTH Royal Institute of Technology and Uppsala University with corresponding in-kind contribution. The research activities cover highly requested studies for today’s nuclear fleet: material embrittlement, stress-corrosion cracking, accident-tolerant fuel development and ageing management for long-term operation (LTO), while the educational part consists of Bachelor and Master programmes as well as elective courses for students outside the main nuclear programmes and contract education. In the master programmes, focus is on e-learning platforms for courses and examination. Examples from such development are to be presented in the full contribution to the conference. Another success story is project based courses in industry, especially within the Bachelor programmes. This is highly appreciated by students, providing a direct contact with future employers, The success of SKC originates from close contact between the funding bodies and academia on many levels: base funding for course preparation, project support in annual calls, and dedicated long-term research funding. But also dedicated industrial experts, and an enthusiasm from academia to enlighten present research issues, as well as strong presence at universities during student fairs and career days. That is LTO of SKC...|$|R
