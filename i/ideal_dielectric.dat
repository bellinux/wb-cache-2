The over-arching dominance of surface (interfacial) optical phonons in 2 D charge transport and engineering <b>ideal</b> nitride-based <b>dielectric</b> environments for large performance gains is reported. Charge transport in MoS 2 field effect transistors (FETs) fabricated on three conventional substrates, SiO 2, Al 2 O 3, and HfO 2, is contrasted with a newly introduced, CMOS-compatible nitride-based dielectric: aluminum nitride (AlN) by employing semi-classical models which account for charged impurity, surface optical phonon, and intrinsic phonon scattering. Unlike previous reports focused on charge impurity scattering, this work presents a new paradigm of utilizing high optical phonon energies intrinsic to ``stiff `` nitride bonds. This results in substantially lower surface optical phonon scattering in 2 D FETs which directly influences peak field effect (FE) mobility, high field mobility degradation, and temperature-dependent mobility. Leveraging on these insights, high-performance sulfur-passivated MoS 2 FETs with an optimum all-nitride environment (hexagonal boron nitride/MoS 2 /AlN) are demonstrated with FE mobility up to 72. 8 cm(2) V- 1 s(- 1).

50|$|The field {{strength}} at which breakdown occurs {{depends on the}} respective geometries of the dielectric (insulator) and the electrodes with which the electric field is applied, {{as well as the}} rate of increase at which the electric field is applied. Because dielectric materials usually contain minute defects, the practical dielectric strength will be a fraction of the intrinsic dielectric strength of an <b>ideal,</b> defect-free, material. <b>Dielectric</b> films tend to exhibit greater dielectric strength than thicker samples of the same material. For instance, the dielectric strength of silicon dioxide films of a few hundred nm to a few μm thick is approximately 0.5GV/m. However very thin layers (below, say, 100 nm) become partially conductive because of electron tunneling. Multiple layers of thin dielectric films are used where maximum practical dielectric strength is required, such as high voltage capacitors and pulse transformers. Since the dielectric strength of gases varies depending on the shape and configuration of the electrodes, it is usually measured as a fraction of the dielectric strength of Nitrogen gas.|$|R
40|$|Electromagnetic field {{fluctuations}} {{are responsible}} for the destruction of electron coherence (dephasing) in solids and in vacuum electron beam interference. The vacuum fluctuations are modified by conductors and dielectrics, as in the Casimir effect, and hence, bodies {{in the vicinity of the}} beams can influence the beam coherence. We calculate the quenching of interference of two beams moving in vacuum parallel to a thick plate with permittivity ϵ(ω) =ϵ_ 0 +i 4 πσ/ω. In case of an <b>ideal</b> conductor or <b>dielectric</b> (|ϵ|=∞) the dephasing is suppressed when the beams are close to the surface of the plate, because the random tangential electric field E_t, responsible for dephasing, is zero at the surface. The situation is changed dramatically when ϵ_ 0 or σ are finite. In this case there exists a layer near the surface, where the fluctuations of E_t are strong due to evanescent near fields. The thickness of this near - field layer is of the order of the wavelength in the dielectric or the skin depth in the conductor, corresponding to a frequency which is the inverse electron time of flight from the emitter to the detector. When the beams are within this layer their dephasing is enhanced and for slow enough electrons can be even stronger than far from the surface...|$|R

Absorption {{of radiation}} then reflects the interfacial polarization. Here we apply an analytical theory and computer simulation to absorption of radiation by ideal solutions of lysozyme. Comparison with experiment shows that Maxwell electrostatics fails to describe the polarization of the protein-water interface and the "Lorentz void", which does not anticipate polarization of the solute void by the external field (no surface charges), better represents the data. An analytical theory for the slope of the solution absorption against the volume fraction of the solute is formulated in terms of the cavity field response function.

The processes of electromechanical phase transition under various conditions are discussed. A reversible cycle is suggested for electromechanical energy conversion using the dielectric elastomer membrane, analogous to the classical Carnot cycle for a heat engine. The amount of energy conversion, however, is limited by failure of the dielectric elastomer due to electrical breakdown.

To analyze the propagation of both longitudinal (P-) and transverse (S-) waves, we utilize compressible material models. We derive explicit expressions of the generalized acoustic tensor and phase velocities of elastic waves for the ideal and enriched dielectric elastomer models. We analyze the slowness curves of the elastic wave propagation, and find the P-S-mode disentangling phenomenon. In particular, P- and S- waves are separated by the application of an electric field. The divergence angle between P- and S-waves strongly depends on the applied electrostatic excitation. The influence of the electric field is sensitive to material models. Thus, for <b>ideal</b> <b>dielectric</b> model the in-plane shear velocity increases with an increase in electric field, while for the enriched model the velocity may decreases depending on material constants. Similarly, the divergence angle gradually increases with an increase in electric field, while for the enriched model, the angle may be bounded.

Using the CPE exponent a {{as a measure of}} ideality, {{it was found that the}} monolayer approaches an <b>ideal</b> <b>dielectric</b> (a 0. 992) under prolonged incubation, which is attributed to the reduction of pinholes and defects in the monolayer during coalescence and annealing of SAM chains.

Using a Randles circuit model for these cases, the variation of the capacitance and charge transfer resistance with applied dc potential shows decreased permeability to ionic species with prolonged incubation time. The EIS data show that UDT (methylene chain length n 10), incubated for 120 h, forms a monolayer whose critical voltage range extends from 0. 3 to 0. 5 V versus Ag/AgCl, previously attained only for alkanethiol at n 15.

It is assumed that the FlcVcm is considered as a molecular dielectric, which consists from neutral dynamides, streamlined in a close-packed crystalline lattice. Every dynamide is a neutral pair, consistent by two massless opposite point-like elementary electric charges (ElmElcChrgs) : electrino (-) and positrino (+). In a frozen equilibrium position two contrary pont-like ElmElcChrgs within every one dynamide are very closely installed one to another and therefore the aggregate polarization of every dynamide and its electric field also have zero values. The aggregate electric field of every dynamide polarizes nearest neighbors dynamides in an account of which nearest dynamides interact between them-self, because of which their elementary excitations, phonons and photons, have a wave character and behaviors. We suppose that the photon is an polarization result of the phonon within the fluctuating vacuum considered as an <b>ideal</b> <b>dielectric</b> and therefore the photon could be considered as an elementary collective excitation of the FlcVcm {{in the form of a}} solitary needle cylindrical harmonic oscillation. Hence the light, which is a packet of the photons, must move within FlcVcm with constant velocity and Dopler effect must be observed in both cases, for the light and sound.
