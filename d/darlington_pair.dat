50|$|The <b>Darlington</b> <b>pair</b> {{has more}} phase shift at high {{frequencies}} {{than a single}} transistor and hence can more easily become unstable with negative feedback (i.e., systems that use this configuration can have poor phase margin due to the extra transistor delay).|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} over the <b>Darlington</b> <b>pair</b> is that the base turn-on voltage is only about 0.6V or half of the Darlington's 1.2V nominal turn-on voltage. Like the Darlington, it can saturate only to 0.6V, which is a drawback for high-power stages.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the operating characteristics of NPN 4 H-SiC (a polytype of silicon carbide) {{bipolar junction transistor}} (BJT) and 4 H-SiC <b>Darlington</b> <b>Pairs.</b> A large amount of experimental data was collected. The wafer BJTs were able to block over the rated 600 V in the common-emitter configuration and the TO- 220 BJTs were able to block over the 1200 V rated voltage. In the thermal analysis, it is found out that at higher temperatures the forward and reverse (blocking) characteristics were stable at 100 °C and 200 °C. The transistors show positive temperature coefficients of forward voltage (Vf). In general the current gain () characteristics obtained (with VCE = 6 V) were approximately as expected for the BJTs. The ’s were very low (2 to 5 for wafer BJTs, 5 to 20 for the wafer <b>Darlington</b> <b>Pairs,</b> and 5 to 30 for TO- 220 BJTs). The large amount of experimental data collected confirms some of the superior properties of the Silicon carbide mate-rial when used to fabricate power semiconductor devices, namely high thermal conductivity and high tem-perature operability. The data presented here will establish the trends {{and the performance of}} silicon carbide devices. The silicon carbide BJT has fast switching and recovery characteristics. From the analysis, silicon carbide power devices will be smaller (about 20 times) than a similar silicon power device and with reduced power losses.

50|$|In electronics, the Darlington {{transistor}} (commonly {{called a}} <b>Darlington</b> <b>pair</b> {{by those in}} the electronics industry) is a compound structure of a particular design made by two bipolar transistors connected {{in such a way}} that the current amplified by the first transistor is amplified further by the second one.

5000|$|In electronics, the Sziklai pair (also {{known as}} a {{complementary}} feedback pair (CFP) or [...] "compound transistor", and as a [...] "pseudo-Darlington") is a configuration of two bipolar transistors, similar to a <b>Darlington</b> <b>pair.</b> In contrast to the Darlington arrangement, the Sziklai pair has one NPN and one PNP transistor, {{and so it is}} sometimes also called the [...] "complementary Darlington".

5000|$|Historically, {{designers}} {{frequently used}} the [...] "quasi-complementary" [...] configuration, {{which uses a}} <b>Darlington</b> push <b>pair</b> (i.e., two NPN transistors) and a Sziklai pull pair (i.e., one PNP and one NPN transistor). This configuration, which uses three NPN transistors and one PNP transistor, is advantageous because while the first transistors and the most common small signal transistors for decades were PNP Germanium devices, silicon PNP power transistors were slower to develop than and have historically been more expensive than their NPN counterparts. Alternately, if a germanium PNP device were used, it would have significantly different characteristics. In the Quasi-complementary topology, {{the performance of the}} lower pull pair, which used a single NPN transistor, more closely matched the performance of the upper push pair, which consists of two NPN transistors and an identical power device.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a typical}} {{application}} the Sziklai pair acts somewhat like a single transistor {{with the same}} type (e.g. NPN) as Q1 and with a very high current gain (β). The emitter of Q2 acts {{the role of a}} collector. Hence the emitter of Q2 is labeled [...] "C" [...] in the figure to the right. Likewise, in a typical application the collector of Q2 (also connected to the emitter of Q1) plays the role of an emitter and is thus labeled [...] "E." [...] As with a <b>Darlington</b> <b>pair,</b> a resistor (e.g., 100Ω - 1kΩ) is usually connected between Q2's emitter and base to improve its turn-off time (i.e., its performance for high frequency signals).|$|E
5000|$|Another {{drawback}} of the <b>Darlington</b> <b>pair</b> is its increased [...] "saturation" [...] voltage. The {{output transistor}} {{is not allowed}} to saturate (i.e. its base-collector junction must remain reverse-biased) because the first transistor, when saturated, establishes full (100%) parallel negative feedback between the collector and the base of the second transistor. Since collector-emitter voltage is equal to the sum of its own base-emitter voltage and the collector-emitter voltage of the first transistor, both positive quantities in normal operation, it always exceeds the base-emitter voltage. (In symbols, [...] always.) Thus the [...] "saturation" [...] voltage of a Darlington transistor is one VBE (about 0.65 V in silicon) higher than a single transistor saturation voltage, which is typically 0.1 - 0.2 V in silicon. For equal collector currents, this drawback translates to an increase in the dissipated power for the Darlington transistor over a single transistor. The increased low output level can cause troubles when TTL logic circuits are driven.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Two {{different}} circuit {{models of}} RC coupled small-signal amplifiers are developed using identical power MOSFETs in <b>Darlington</b> <b>pair</b> configuration. Proposed circuits successfully eliminate the poor frequency response problem of <b>Darlington</b> <b>pair</b> amplifiers at higher frequencies. An additional biasing resistance R A, ranging from 1 KΩ to 100 KΩ, {{is to be}} essentially used in the proposed circuits to maintain their voltage/current amplification property. In presence of R A, proposed amplifiers crop considerably high voltage gains, moderate range bandwidths and sufficiently high current gains in 1 - 10 mV input signal range at 1 KHz frequency. Both the circuits can be tuned in specific audible frequency range, extending approximately from 130 Hz to 55 KHz. Tuning performance makes these amplifier circuits suitable to use in Radio and TV receivers. The qualitative and tuning performance offer a flexible application to these amplifiers {{to be used as}} high voltage gain, high power gain and tuned amplifiers. Variations in voltage gain as a function of frequency and different biasing resistances, temperature dependency of performance parameters, bandwidth and total harmonic distortion of the amplifiers are also perused to provide a wide spectrum to the qualitative studies...|$|E
