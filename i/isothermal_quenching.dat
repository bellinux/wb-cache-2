40|$|The work {{determines the}} effect of {{austempering}} (<b>isothermal</b> <b>quenching)</b> on the basic mechanical properties of cast iron with vermicular graphite. The cast iron has been produced in one of Polish foundries. Copper addition {{in the amount of}} about 1 % has been introduced to the cast iron in order to obtain the pearlitic matrix. The mechanical properties (Rm, R 0, 2, A 5, HB) have been determined both for the as-cast state and after austenitizing at 960 °C combined with quenching at 290 °C for 90 minutes, and also after austenitizing at 960 °C followed by <b>isothermal</b> <b>quenching</b> at 290 °C for 150 minutes. It has been found that the thermal treatment, resulting in the cast iron matrix change from the ferritic-pearlitic one to the one composed of acicular precipitates of ferrite and residual austenite, causes a distinct increase in cast iron strength; after the thermal treatment it has reached about 900 ÷ 1000 MPa.

40|$|Wrought Al-Mg-Si alloys {{are widely}} used in machine {{building}} and construction. Their tendency to pitting and intergranuler corrosion {{is because of the}} fact that in the course of slow cooling under solutionizing temperature the precipitate free zones and comparatively large intermetallic precipitates appear at the grain boundaries. The quench factor analysis allows us to establish a mathematical relationship between the characteristics of thermally hardened alloy and the quenching factor as well as to predict the alloy properties, but for this purpose, TTP diagrams must be built up using <b>isothermal</b> <b>quenching</b> to calculate the quench factor. The aim of this work is to study and simulate the effect of soaking of the <b>isothermal</b> <b>quenching</b> on corrosion resistance of the thermally hardened V 1341 alloy. Change of corrosion current density and mass loss of isothermally quenched and artificially aged wrought Al-Si-Mg-Cu alloy were determined for isothermal soaking steps of different duration.

Cooling rates were systematically varied, from 0. 1 to 50 °C min– 1, encompassing environmental to near-“isothermal” temperature changes, between 22 and − 5 °C, for a reference concentration of 20 % SDS-H 2 O. The cooling rate was shown to determine the dominant crystal morphologies, with platelets and needles predominating at the lowest and highest rates, respectively. The results were rationalized in terms of isothermal crystallization data and the time–temperature cooling profile. Rates 0. 1, 5. 0, and 10 °C min– 1 yield morphologies and kinetics analogous to those of <b>isothermal</b> <b>quenches</b> at the corresponding crystallization temperature window. Nontrivial deviations were observed for intermediate rates (0. 5, 1. 0 °C min– 1), due to commensurate changes in temperature and crystallization mechanism, accompanied by solute depletion. The polythermal metastable zone width was estimated, and the non-isothermal nucleation described by the Nývlt equation, while the Avrami and Kissinger models described overall crystallization kinetics.

The {{results show that the}} microstructure of high boron white cast iron is mainly composed of many continuous and netlike eutectic borides, pearlite and ferrite under as-cast condition. The microhardness of Fe 2 B ranges in 1200 - 1600 HV whose value seems to approximate that of (Fe,Cr) 7 C 3 –type carbide (HV 1200 ~ 1800) in high chromium white cast iron.

At the initial stage of annealing cementite precipitations occurred in the interfaces between ferritic bainite and austenite. With increasing temperature of annealing, the volume fraction and size of cementite precipitations also increased. Simultaneously fine spherical Fe 7 C 3 carbides appeared. At the highest annealing temperature the large, spherical Fe 7 C 3 carbides as well as cementite precipitates inside the ferrite grains were observed.

The aim of the investigations was to look closer into the structure – mechanical properties relationships of this very attractive cast material. The experiment was carried out with 500 7 grade ductile iron, which was austempered using different parameters of heat treatment. The specimens were first solution treated 1 hour in 910 oC and then isothermally quenched for different time in silicon oil bath of temperature 275, 325, 300 and 350 oC. The mechanical properties heat treated specimens were tested in tensile to evaluate yield stress Re, 0. 2, tensile strength Rm and elongation A 10. Additionally hardness of heat treated samples was measured using Brinell-Rockwell hardness tester. Structure of the specimens was studied either with conventional metallography, scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. It followed from the study that conventional grade ductile iron enabled to produce both low and high strength ADI, depend on heat treatment parameters. As expected the low temperature <b>isothermal</b> <b>quenching</b> produced higher strength ADI compare to the same ductile iron but austempered at 350 oC.

The nanostructuring treatment consisted of austempering with an <b>isothermal</b> <b>quenching</b> at 240 °C and 300 °C. The conventional heat treatment consisted on quenching and tempering at 350 °C for 1 h and quenching and tempering at 550 °C for 1 h. Time and temperature of tempering was chosen so that the hardness of both samples (nanostructured as well as quenched and tempered) was similar. The microstructure of steel after each heat treatment was described {{with the use of}} transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It was shown, that the austempering conducted at 240 °C produced homogenous nanobainitic structure consisting of carbide-free bainite plates with nanometric thickness separated by the layers of retained austenite. The austempering at 300 °C produced a sub-micrometric carbide-free bainite with retained austenite in form of layers and small blocks. The conventional heat treatments led to a tempered martensite microstructure. The corrosion resistance study was carried out in Na 2 SO 4 acidic and neutral environment using potentiodynamic and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods. The corrosion resistance of nanostructured steel samples were compared to the steel samples with tempered martensite. The obtained results indicate, that the corrosion resistance of bearing steel with nanobainitic structure is similar to steel with tempered martensite in both acidic and neutral environment.

40|$|Deformable alloys of the Al-Mg-Si {{system are}} widely used in {{aviation}} industry, rocket engineering, shipbuilding, {{as well as on}} railway and highway transport. These alloys are characterized by high stamping ability, weld-ability, and machinability with a comparatively high strength and corrosion resistance in a heat-strengthened state. A promising alloy of the Al-Mg-Si system with increased structural strength and manufacturability is on par with foreign analogues in properties is the V- 1341 alloy [1, 2]. The properties of heat-treatable aluminum alloys strongly depend on the cooling rate of the product during quenching [3 - 12], which determines the structure and level of residual stresses. Decrease in structural strength, tendency to pitting and inter-crystalline corrosion with slow cooling from the quenching temperature is caused by formation of coarse unequiaxed precipitate, precipitates - free zones, and also by decreasing proportion of inclusions of the strengthening phase [3 - 12]. Thus, the relevant task is to study the effect of <b>isothermal</b> <b>quenching</b> modes on the structure of deformable V- 1341 aluminum alloy thermally hardened. The paper studies the impact of isothermal time in quenching on the composition and morphology of breakdown products of the V- 1341 alloy solid solution. It is shown that at isothermal time under the solid solution breakdown, at first on the dispersoid surface and then in the solid solution are formed and grow large needle-like crystals of the β'-phase which are structural concentrators of stresses. An increasing isothermal time leads to decreasing solid solution super-saturation by doping elements and vacancies.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe FSP of Nickel Aluminum Bronze {{is a novel}} approach to enhance the microstructural properties of the material through a shear deformation process. This thesis examines the effect on microstructure of <b>isothermal</b> annealing and <b>quenching</b> of as-cast Nickel Aluminum Bronze and, furthermore, reports on investigation {{of the effects of}} isothermal hot rolling on microstructure of this material. Quantitative analysis of the microstructure constituents shows that heating to about 800 oC results in the formation of beta by reversion of the eutectoid constituent alpha + kappaiii. Further heating in the range of 800 - 1000 oC results in an approximately linear decrease in the volume fraction of primary alpha and a corresponding increase in the volume fraction of beta transformation products. Isothermal rolling of NAB over this same temperature interval results in deformation of both phases and an elongated, banded distribution of alpha and beta transformation products {{in the middle of this}} interval. This suggests that local peak temperature in the stir zone of material that has been subjected to FSP may be estimated by microstructure analysis. The yield and ultimate strengths of NAB are increased and ductility is also increased when rolled material is compared to as-cast NAB. However, strength and hardness appear to be independent of prior rolling temperature. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|The {{molten globule}} (MG) state of {{proteins}} is widely detected through binding with 1 -anilino- 8 -naphthalene sulphonate (ANS), a fluorescent dye. This strategy {{is based upon}} the assumption that when in molten globule state, the exposed hydrophobic clusters of protein are readily bound by the nonpolar anilino-naphthalene moiety of ANS molecules which then produce brilliant fluorescence. In this work, we explored the acid-induced unfolding pathway of chymopapain, a cysteine proteases from Carica papaya, by monitoring the conformational changes over a pH range 1. 0 - 7. 4 by circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence, ANS binding, acrylamide <b>quenching,</b> <b>isothermal</b> titration calorimetry (ITC) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The spectroscopic measurements showed that although maximum ANS fluorescence intensity was observed at pH 1. 0, however protein exhibited ∼ 80 % loss of secondary structure which does not comply with the characteristics of a typical MG-state. In contrast at pH 1. 5, chymopapain retains substantial amount of secondary structure, disrupted side chain interactions, increased hydrodynamic radii and nearly 30 -fold increase in ANS fluorescence with respect to the native state, indicating that MG-state exists at pH 1. 5 and not at pH 1. 0. ITC measurements revealed that ANS molecules bound to chymopapain via hydrophobic interaction were more at pH 1. 5 than at pH 1. 0. However, a large number of ANS molecules were also involved in electrostatic interaction with protein at pH 1. 0 which, together with hydrophobically interacted molecules, may be responsible for maximum ANS fluorescence. We conclude that maximum ANS-fluorescence alone may not be the criteria for determining the MG of chymopapain. Hence a comprehensive structural analysis of the intermediate is essentially required...|$|R
40|$|The Dual Phase Steels (DP Steels) have {{attracted}} interest of steel manufacturers, especially automotive industry, {{because of a}} good combination of high strength and ductility. The final DP steel microstructures are formed during continuous heating to intercritical temperatures, then <b>isothermal</b> holding and <b>quenching</b> to form a mix of ferrite and martensite. Final martensite content, morphology and spatial distribution depends on the austenite formed during the isothermal holding. The austenite formation {{is affected by the}} progress of ferrite recrystallization during continuous heating. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the process of ferrite recrystallization. This thesis aims to study the effect of Si and Mn, which are common alloying elements in steels, on the ferrite recrystallization. The present study extensively uses in-situ 2 D X-ray Diffraction (XRD) to investigate the ferrite recrystallization kinetics. This technique is faster and records more data than the other conventional methods used to study the kinetics of recrystallization until now. This study introduces a method to quantify the recrystallized grains using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Backscattered Electron Detector (BED). This method results in faster analysis of microstructure. The microstructure analysis helped in quantifying the grain growth, its dimensions and type of nucleation. Afterwards, those have been used as input parameters for modified non-isothermal JMAK model. This model is used to obtain the kinetic parameters from the experimental in-situ 2 D XRD results by model fitting. The parameters obtained are: rate constant, activation energy and Avrami exponent. In all the cases, the microstructure analysis show site-saturated nucleation and predominantly 2 D grain growth. The model fitting reveals that most nucleation cases show site-saturation. The density of nucleation sites is dependent on the pearlite content of the alloys. The boundaries between deformed pearlite and ferrite being the preferred nucleation sites. In some cases, the recrystallization nuclei are also seen at the boundaries between the ferrite grains which correspond to areas with micro-segregation of Mn. Presence of Mn is leading to an increase recrystallization start temperatures. The solute drag effect of Mn is quite high. Similarly, Si is also retarding the recrystallization. The retardation effect of Si is not as significant as Mn. The solute drag effect seems to be dependent on the velocity of the grain boundaries and consequently, on progress of recrystallization. In presence of Mn, the Si is able to interact with the moving grain boundaries. This points to co-segregation effect between Mn and Si. This effect was found to be strongest for 1 : 1 Si to Mn atomic fractions, where the lowest growth rates were observed.
