In this paper, we describe a new overlap removal method that penalizes the overlap of dots and minimizes {{the sum of the}} penalties by using a nonlinear optimization technique. Through computational experiments with real world data, we show that our optimization-based method runs faster than an existing simulation-based method and generates <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> with comparable quality. ...|$|R

2500|$|Irwin's early {{experiments}} tested participants {{ability to}} identify random dot patterns as the same, or as different across saccades. The control condition for this experiment presented dot patterns in the same spatial location without saccades, meaning participants had a single fixation point. [...] A no-overlap control condition presented dot patterns in different spatial locations, while participants maintained fixation on one point. This tested the ability of visual short-term memory in identifying two individual patterns. The experimental condition showed dot patterns in the same spatial location but were viewed at separate fixations, forcing the use of transsaccadic memory. For the experimental condition, participants underwent a calibration phase, where they were shown five points in separate location to fixate on individually, for less than two seconds. The next phase presented a single fixation point for less than two seconds, which {{was followed by a}} random <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> presented in a different location, acting as a saccade target. The <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> disappeared when the saccade was initiated. Another <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> then appeared in the same location.

40|$|Abstract: This {{study is}} to develop a {{micromachining}} technology for a light guide panel(LGP) mold, whereby micro <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> are formed on a LGP surface by a single injection process instead of existing screen printing processes. The micro powder blasting technique is applied to form micro <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> on the LGP mold surface. The optimal conditions for masking, laminating, exposure, and developing processes to form the micro <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> are first experimentally investigated. A LGP mold with masked micro patterns is then machined using the micro powder blasting method and the machinability of the micro <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> is verified. A prototype LGP is test- injected using the developed LGP mold and a shape analysis of the patterns and performance testing of the injected LGP are carried out. As an additional approach, matte finishing, a special surface treatment method, is applied to the mold surface to improve the light diffusion characteristics, uniformity and brightness of the LGP. The results of this study show that the applied powder blasting method can be successfully used to manufacture LGPs with micro patterns by just single injection using the developed mold and thereby replace existing screen printing methods...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} amount of {{evidence}} suggesting that individuals with autism have difficulty with categorization. One basic cognitive ability that is necessary for categorization and may underlie these difficulties {{is the ability to}} abstract and represent the categorical information with a central representation or prototype. The current study examined prototype formation abilities in individuals with autism with social (faces) and non-social (<b>dot</b> <b>patterns)</b> stimuli using behavioral methodologies and eye-tracking in high functioning adults with autism and matched controls. Individuals with autism were found to have difficulty forming prototypes of both faces and <b>dot</b> <b>patterns.</b> Relationships were found between performance on the prototype tasks and measures of intelligence, symptoms of autism, and measures of lower-level perceptual functioning in the individuals with autism. The eye-tracking data did not reveal any between group differences in the general pattern of attention to the faces or <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> during the familiarization period indicating that the difficulties with prototype formation were not due to attentional factors. The results of the current study are consistent with previous studies that have found a deficit in prototype formation and indicate that these deficits exist with both familiar social stimuli such as faces and novel non-social stimuli such as <b>dot</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Within an {{individual}} cell, the dot positions {{are arranged in}} two columns of three positions. A raised dot can appear {{in any of the}} six positions, producing sixty-four (26) possible patterns, including one in which there are no raised dots. For reference purposes, a pattern is commonly described by listing the positions where dots are raised, the positions being universally numbered, from top to bottom, as 1 to 3 on the left and 4 to 6 on the right. For example, <b>dot</b> <b>pattern</b> 1-3-4 describe a cell with three dots raised, at the top and bottom in the left column and {{at the top of the}} right column: [...] that is, the letter [...] m. The lines of horizontal Braille text are separated by a space, much like visible printed text, so that the dots of one line can be differentiated from the braille text above and below. Different assignments of braille codes (or code pages) are used to map the character sets of different printed scripts to the six-bit cells. Braille assignments have also been created for mathematical and musical notation. However, because the six-dot braille cell allows only 64 (26) patterns, including space, the characters of a braille script commonly have multiple values, depending on their context. That is, character mapping between print and braille is not one-to-one. [...] For example, the character [...] corresponds in print to both the letter d and the digit 4.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{question in the}} study of consciousness is the connection between subjective report and objective measures. We explored this question by testing NM, a grapheme-color synesthete, who experiences colors when viewing digits but not <b>dot</b> <b>patterns.</b> Synesthesia research has traditionally used variants of the Stroop paradigm as an objective correlate of these subjective synesthetic reports. We used both a classical synesthetic Digit Stroop task and a novel Numerosity Stroop task, in which random <b>dot</b> <b>patterns</b> were colored either congruently or incongruently with the colors NM reported for digits. We observed longer response times in the incongruent condition for both tasks, despite the fact that NM denied experiencing colors for random <b>dot</b> <b>patterns,</b> constituting a clear dissociation between subjective and objective measures of synesthetic experience. We argue that distinguishing synesthesia from learned synesthesia-like associations (pseudosynesthesia) should depend primarily on the presence of subjective reports, validated by objective measures. More generally, we suggest that consciously and unconsciously mediated interference may arise from qualitatively different mechanisms...|$|R
