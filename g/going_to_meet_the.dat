25|$|In 1894, the Westport - Newport railway {{line was}} {{extended}} to Achill Sound. The train station is now a hostel. The train provided a great service to Achill, but it also fulfilled an ancient prophecy. Brian Rua O' Cearbhain had prophesied that 'carts on iron wheels' would carry bodies into Achill on their first and last journey. In 1894, the first train on the Achill railway carried the bodies of victims of the Clew Bay Drowning. This tragedy occurred when a boat overturned in Clew Bay, drowning thirty-two young people. They had been <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> steamer which would take them to Scotland for potato picking.|$|E
500|$|Because of the Master Chief's {{large role}} in {{previous}} games, significant effort was expended on the Spartan units. Lead designer Dave Pottinger said the design team [...] "started out just accepting and embracing {{the fact that the}} Spartans have to be the coolest unit in the game. If they're not, it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> Halo fans' expectations." [...] To position the Spartans as [...] "kingmakers" [...] in gameplay, the team gave them what it considered to be the [...] "coolest" [...] unit ability: hijacking enemy vehicles. The developers hoped players would become attached to individual Spartans in the campaign and gave each one an individual name; skirmish units were left nameless. The character design of the Spartans was meant to emphasize their relative inexperience and the setting of the game, which takes place decades before the events of the main trilogy. Devine commented on the Spartans' look: ...|$|E

500|$|According to {{survivor}} accounts, {{before dawn}} on August 15 the H Company mortar platoon {{became aware of}} enemy activity near Hill 303. The platoon leader telephoned G Company, 5th Cavalry, which informed him a platoon of 60 South Korean troops would come to reinforce the mortar platoon. Later {{in the morning the}} platoon saw two North Korean T-34s followed by 200 or more enemy soldiers on the road below them. A little later a group of Koreans appeared on the slope. A patrol <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> climbing Korean troops called out and received in reply a blast of gunfire from automatic weapons. The mortar platoon leader, Lt. Jack Hudspeth, believed they were friendly. Some of the Americans realized that the advancing troops were North Korean and were going to open up on them according to former Pvt. Fred Ryan and Pvt. Roy Manring, when they revisited the old mortar position in 1999. Hudspeth ordered them not to fire and threatened them with a court-martial if they did. The rest of the watching Americans were not convinced that the new arrivals were enemy soldiers until the red stars became visible on their field caps. By that time, they were extremely close to the American positions. The North Korean troops came right up to the foxholes without either side firing a shot. Hudspeth ordered his platoon to surrender without a fight as it was far outnumbered and outgunned. The North Koreans quickly took [...] the mortarmen captive. Estimates of the number captured range from 31 to 42.|$|E
2500|$|Templer became General Officer Commanding [...] (GOC) of the 47th (London) Infantry Division, {{based in}} Winchester, Hampshire as an acting major general on 10 April 1942, serving under V Corps. The {{division}} – comprising the 25th, 140th and 141st Infantry Brigades and supporting units – was a second-line TA formation, formerly the 2nd London Division, redesignated the 47th Division in November 1940. Placed on the Lower Establishment in December 1941, the division was understrength in manpower and equipment {{and men were}} constantly posted as drafts overseas, but the men were well-trained, due to their previous GOC, Major General John Utterson-Kelso, {{one of the best}} trainers in the British Army. According to a battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Darling, commanding the 11th Battalion, Royal Fusiliers, Templer [...] "inspired the Division with enthusiasm, keenness and efficiency", and [...] "made them believe they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> <b>the</b> Germans – and beat them. He inculcated a tremendous fighting spirit". Another junior staff officer, Edward Jones, believed Templer to be very nervy but keen, claiming he never slept during an exercise, no matter the length and believed he would burn himself out.|$|E
