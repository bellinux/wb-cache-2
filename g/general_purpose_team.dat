To motivate any further discussion, let us answer some questions that may arise in one's mind. Why should we talk of a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> transport protocol ? Obviously because a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> protocol would provide high degree of flexibility, orthogonality and user-configurability to cater to the various complex user applications today. But will a <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> transport protocol not affect performance (considering that special purpose transport protocols will serve a particular class of applications very effectively) ? No. It has been shown that a well designed <b>general</b> <b>purpose</b> protocol should be able to provide [...] ...|$|R
