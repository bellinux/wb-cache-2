5|$|American {{hazelnut}} (Corylus americana), appealing for breeding {{because of}} its relative <b>hardiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Breeding {{is being}} {{undertaken}} in Europe and New Zealand to produce fruit with better eating qualities and bushes with greater <b>hardiness</b> and disease resistance.|$|E
5|$|While Amaryllidaceae is not {{native to}} North America, it grows well in USDA <b>hardiness</b> zones 3B through 10, which {{encompass}} {{most of the}} United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum cultivars {{and species}} {{can be grown}} inside in pots or outside in warmer climates (<b>Hardiness</b> 7B-11). Many will bloom year after year {{provided}} they are given a dormant period in a cool, dark place for two months without water or fertilizer although some bulbs will start growing before the two-month period is up.|$|E
5|$|Tolerant of both {{heat and}} cold, it is grown in North America in United States Department of Agriculture <b>hardiness</b> zones three through nine, {{although}} some cultivars {{may be better}} suited than others to extremes of temperature. It is successfully grown from the southwestern United States, north and east {{across much of the}} country, and across the Canada–US border into Ontario and Quebec. In the coldest of these areas, it may require considerable protection to survive the winter. In the United Kingdom, the Royal Horticultural Society has assigned it <b>hardiness</b> rating H4, indicating that it tolerates temperatures as low as , hardy in most of the country through typical winters.|$|E
5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes. Its <b>hardiness</b> has prompted research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a weed outside its natural habitat.|$|E
5|$|A {{selected}} white-flowered {{form from}} the Errinundra Plateau, which was originally known as 'Plateau View Alba' or 'Plateau View White', was registered by the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority in 1990 as 'Errindundra White'. Plantsmen have also developed several hybrids with T.speciosissima, looking {{to combine the}} <b>hardiness</b> of T. oreades with the showier flowerheads of the latter. Red-, pink- and even white-flowered cultivars are available.|$|E
5|$|Utica has a {{continental}} climate with four distinct seasons {{and is in}} the humid continental climate (or warm-summer climate: Köppen Dfb) zone, characterized by cold winters and temperate summers. Summer daytime temperatures range from 70–82°F (21-28°C), with an average winter daytime temperature below -3°C (27°F). The city is in USDA plant <b>hardiness</b> zone 5a, and native vegetation can tolerate temperatures from -10°F to -20°F (-28.9°C to -26.1°C).|$|E
5|$|Washington {{is in the}} {{northern}} part of the humid subtropical climate zone (Köppen: Cfa) However, under the Trewartha climate classification, the city has a temperate maritime climate (Do). Winters are usually chilly with light snow, and summers are hot and humid. The District is in plant <b>hardiness</b> zone 8a near downtown, and zone 7b elsewhere in the city, indicating a humid subtropical climate.|$|E
5|$|All colors {{other than}} Appaloosa are allowed for registration. Welara Sport Ponies {{may be of}} any color or size, without the {{restrictions}} of the purebred Welara. The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement, spirit and <b>hardiness,</b> as well as good movement. The head is small and slightly , the neck is arched (and prone to be cresty in stallions). The shoulders and croup are long and the back short. Welaras are used mainly in English riding, especially in hunter classes. They are also seen in show jumping, three-day eventing, pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses. Welara/Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes.|$|E
5|$|Bottle trees grow best in well-drained, {{slightly}} acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are {{suited to}} cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA <b>hardiness</b> zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the bottle tree is very slow-growing, {{and the formation}} of the unique bottle shape is not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant easily, and can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment. Bottle trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} {{selectively}} bred for head weight and morphological characteristics, frost <b>hardiness,</b> fast growth and storage ability. The {{appearance of the}} cabbage head has been given importance in selective breeding, with varieties being chosen for shape, color, firmness and other physical characteristics. Breeding objectives are now focused on increasing resistance to various insects and diseases and improving the nutritional content of cabbage. Scientific research into the genetic modification of B.oleracea crops, including cabbage, has included European Union and United States explorations of greater insect and herbicide resistance. Genetically modified B.oleracea crops are not currently used in commercial agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Draught camel {{are used}} for several {{purposes}} including ploughing, processing in oil mills and pulling carts. There is no clear description for the ideal draught camel, though its strength, its ability to survive without water and the flatness of its feet could be indicators. It {{may be used for}} ploughing in pairs or in groups with buffaloes or bullocks. The draught camel can plough at around , and should not be used for more than six hours a day four hours in the morning and two in the afternoon. The camel is not easily exhausted unless diseased or undernourished, and has remarkable endurance and <b>hardiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought. The first is traditional breeders seeking {{to preserve the}} original type, that of a light draft horse living high in the mountains year-round and retaining the <b>hardiness</b> for which the breed is known. The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the breed into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the breed. This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the breed.|$|E
5|$|Hardy and versatile, B.integrifolia {{will grow}} in clay, sand, acid and even {{alkaline}} soils, {{and it shows}} good resistance to wind and salt, making it suitable for seaside planting. It is therefore highly regarded as a low-maintenance garden tree, although its large size makes it unsuitable for smaller gardens. Its <b>hardiness</b> may however forewarn weed potential, as some evidence of weediness has been seen in Western Australia and New Zealand. When growing near bushland within its native habitat, it is recommended to obtain local provenance seed or plants if available.|$|E
5|$|In the past, Exmoors {{were used}} as pit ponies. Ponies not kept in semi-feral {{conditions}} are used {{for a variety of}} activities including showing, long-distance riding, driving, and agility. Exmoor ponies won both divisions at the International Horse Agility Championships in 2011, and took a third title at the 2012 Championships. The breed's <b>hardiness</b> makes it suitable for conservation grazing, and it contributes to the management of many heathland, chalk grassland and other natural pasture habitats, {{as well as to the}} conservation of Exmoor itself.|$|E
5|$|Teller left Hungary in 1926, {{partly due}} to the discriminatory numerus clausus rule under Miklós Horthy's regime. The {{political}} climate and revolutions in Hungary during his youth instilled a lingering animosity for both Communism and Fascism in Teller. When he was a young student, his right foot was severed in a streetcar accident in Munich, requiring him to wear a prosthetic foot, and leaving him with a lifelong limp. Werner Heisenberg said that it was the <b>hardiness</b> of Teller's spirit, rather than stoicism, that allowed him to cope so well with the accident.|$|E
5|$|The Izak {{catshark}} is harmless and of no commercial value. It {{is regularly}} caught incidentally (and discarded) by a bottom trawl fishery targeting hake south of Cape Town. In contrast to most cartilaginous fishes, its {{numbers have been}} increasing {{in the presence of}} commercial fishing. The reasons for this may include its high reproductive rate, its breeding in less-fished shallower waters, its <b>hardiness</b> allowing for high post-capture survival, and its opportunistic diet. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has consequently listed the Izak catshark under Least Concern, while still noting that it merits continued population monitoring because of its highly restricted range.|$|E
5|$|The Kerry Bog Pony is a {{mountain}} and moorland breed of pony that originated in Ireland. Possibly {{descended from the}} Irish Hobby horse, it originally lived a mainly feral existence in the peat bogs {{of what is now}} County Kerry in southwestern Ireland. Local inhabitants used the ponies as pack and cart horses for transporting peat and kelp to the villages. The breed developed physical characteristics including a low weight-to-height ratio and an unusual footfall pattern, which helped it move on soft ground such as peat bogs. The ponies were known for <b>hardiness</b> and an ability to survive in harsh conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Marwari or Malani {{is a rare}} {{breed of}} horse from the Marwar (or Jodhpur) region of India. Known for its inward-turning ear tips, it comes in all equine colours, {{although}} pinto patterns {{tend to be the}} most popular with buyers and breeders. It is known for its <b>hardiness,</b> and is quite similar to the Kathiawari, another Indian breed from the Kathiawar region southwest of Marwar. Many breed members exhibit a natural ambling gait. The Marwari are descended from native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses, possibly with some Mongolian influence.|$|E
5|$|The Welara is a part-Arabian pony breed {{developed}} from the Arabian horse and the Welsh pony. It was originally bred in England by Lady Wentworth at the Crabbet Arabian Stud in the early 1900s from imported Arabian stallions and Welsh pony mares. Breeding then spread throughout North America. In 1981, a breed registry was formed in the United States, and a studbook began to be published. They are used for many disciplines of English riding, and {{are known for their}} refinement, <b>hardiness</b> and spirit.|$|E
5|$|Under the Köppen climate classification, Boston has a humid {{continental}} climate (Köppen Dfa or Dfb) that borders a humid subtropical climate or a temperate oceanic climate (Köppen Cfa or Cfb) with some maritime influence. Despite its climate, the city {{lies at the}} transition between USDA plant <b>hardiness</b> zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize {{the influence of the}} Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Colts are {{assessed}} in their two-year-old {{year by the}} New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society for suitability to be kept as stallions; any animal failing the assessment must be gelded. Once approved, every spring (usually in March), the stallions must pass the Verderers' assessment before they are permitted onto the Forest to breed. The stallion scheme resulted in a reduction of genetic diversity in the ponies running out on the New Forest, and to counteract this and preserve the <b>hardiness</b> of Forest-run ponies, the Verderers introduced the Bloodline Diversity Project, which will use hardy Forest-run mares, mostly over eleven years old, bred to stallions {{that have not been}} run out on the Forest, or closely related to those that have.|$|E
5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in <b>hardiness,</b> size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the red maple's range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing red maples for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US <b>Hardiness</b> Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. The trees are of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E
5|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, {{including}} normal trade {{in the area and}} attempts to improve the breed, Arabian, Thoroughbred, Welsh pony, and Hackney blood had been added to ponies in the New Forest. Over time, however, the better-quality ponies were sold off, leaving the poorer-quality and less hardy animals as the Forest breeding stock. To address this situation, as well as to increase the stock's <b>hardiness</b> and restore native type, {{in the early twentieth century}} animals from other British native mountain and moorland pony breeds such as the Fell, Dales, Highland, Dartmoor, and Exmoor were introduced to the Forest. This practice ended in 1930, and since that time, only purebred New Forest stallions may be turned out. The New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society has been publishing the stud book since 1960. New Forest ponies have been exported to many parts of the world, including Canada, the U.S., Europe, and Australia, and many countries now have their own breed societies and stud books.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the cloudy {{catshark}} adapts well to captivity and has {{reproduced in}} the aquarium. It {{is often used}} as a model organism in physiology research. On September 25, 1995, Masuda Motoyashi and colleagues used this species to perform the first successful artificial insemination of a shark or ray. The cloudy catshark is caught incidentally by commercial fisheries with bottom fishing nets including trawls and gillnets, {{as well as on}} bottom longlines. Captured individuals are typically discarded, possibly with a high survival rate due to their <b>hardiness.</b> Some 40% of the fish discarded in Yamaguchi Prefecture fisheries are of this species. The bottom trawl fishery operating off Fukushima Prefecture may catch over a ton of cloudy catsharks annually, which are also discarded.|$|E
5|$|Modern cottage garden {{plants are}} {{typically}} flowers chosen for their old-fashioned and informal appeal. Many modern day gardeners use heirloom or 'old-fashioned' plants and varieties—even though these {{may not have}} been authentic or traditional cottage garden plants. In addition, there are modern varieties of flowers that fit into the cottage garden look. For example, modern roses developed by David Austin have been chosen for cottage gardens because of their old-fashioned look (multi-petaled form and rosette-shaped flowers) and fragrance—combined with modern virtues of <b>hardiness,</b> repeat blooming, and disease-resistance. Modern cottage gardens often use native plants and those adapted to the local climate, rather than trying to force traditional English plants to grow in an incompatible environment—though many of the old favorites thrive in cottage gardens throughout the world.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{the late}} 19th century, {{uncontrolled}} crossbreeding created {{a decline in}} the population of purebred Mérens. By the early 20th century, some breeders in L'Hospitalet and Mérens-les-Vals began to work against these crossings with outside breeds and bred only horses with conformation similar to the original Mérens. These breeders wanted to keep alive the traditional Mérens, which they valued for its <b>hardiness</b> and versatility. In 1908, control of breeding was given to the President of the Société d’Agriculture de l’Ariège (Agricultural Society of Ariege), Gabriel Lamarque, who was dedicated to the preservation of the breed. In 1933, the Syndicat d'élevage du Mérens (Breeding Society of Mérens) was created, and in 1948 the first stud book was created {{under the control of the}} French National Stud.|$|E
5|$|The Marwari is {{descended from}} native Indian ponies crossed with Arabian horses. The ponies {{were small and}} hardy, but with poor conformation; the {{influence}} of the Arabian blood improved the appearance without compromising the <b>hardiness.</b> The Arabians possibly came ashore from a cargo ship wrecked off India's west coast. Legend in India states that the Arabian ship, containing seven Arabian horses of good breeding, was shipwrecked off the shore of the Kachchh District. These horses were then taken to the Marwar district and used as foundation bloodstock for the Marwari. There is also the possibility of some Mongolian influence from the north. The breed probably originated in northwest India on the Afghanistan border, as well as in Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan, and takes its name from the Marwar region (also called the Jodhpur region) of India.|$|E
5|$|The Rathores, {{traditional}} {{rulers of}} the Marwar region of western India, {{were the first to}} breed the Marwari. Beginning in the 12th century, they espoused strict breeding that promoted purity and <b>hardiness.</b> Used throughout history as a cavalry horse by the people of the Marwar region, the Marwari was noted for its loyalty and bravery in battle. The breed deteriorated in the 1930s, when poor management practices resulted in a reduction of the breeding stock, but today has regained some of its popularity. The Marwari is used for light draught and agricultural work, as well as riding and packing. In 1995, a breed society was formed for the Marwari in India. The exportation of Marwaris was banned for decades, but between 2000 and 2006, a small number of exports were allowed. Since 2008, visas allowing temporary travel of Marwaris outside India have been available in small numbers.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Pony and Cob is a {{group of}} four closelyrelated horse breeds {{including}} both pony and cob types, which originated in Wales in the United Kingdom. The four sections within the breed society for the Welsh breeds are primarily distinguished by height, and also by variations in type: the smallest Welsh Mountain Pony (Section A); the slightly taller but refined Welsh Pony of riding type (Section B) popular as a children's show mount; the small but stocky Welsh Pony of Cob Type (Section C), popular for riding and competitive driving; and the tallest, the Welsh Cob (Section D), which can be ridden by adults. Welsh ponies and cobs in all sections are known for their good temperament, <b>hardiness,</b> and free-moving gaits.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} of farm animals seldom occurs spontaneously but is managed by farmers {{with a view}} to encouraging certain traits that are seen as desirable. These include <b>hardiness,</b> prolificness, mothering abilities, fast growth rates, low feed consumption per unit of growth, better body proportions, higher yields, better fibre qualities and other characteristics. Undesirable traits such as health defects, aggressiveness or lack of docility are selected against. Selective breeding has been responsible for some large increases in productivity. In 2007, a typical broiler chicken at eight weeks old was 4.8 times as heavy as a bird of similar age in 1957. In the thirty years to 2007, the average milk yield of a dairy cow in the United States nearly doubled.|$|E
5|$|The islands {{all fall}} within the Shetland Islands Council local authority. They have been {{continuously}} inhabited since Neolithic times and experienced Norse rule for several centuries, the first written records being the Norse sagas. The excavations at Jarlshof near {{the southern end of}} the Mainland have provided archaeological evidence of life in Shetland since Bronze Age times and the annual Up Helly Aa fire festivals are a living reminder of Shetland's Viking past. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide and there are numerous lighthouses as an aid to navigation. A small wind farm on Shetland recently achieved a world record of 58% capacity over the course of a year. The indigenous Shetland ponies are reputed for their strength and <b>hardiness.</b>|$|E
5|$|The mild seas that {{surround}} Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making winter frost rare: on average 9.6 days per year— {{this is far}} below the United Kingdom's average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to six days per year; almost all winters have {{no more than one}} day with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet it almost never settles on the ground—coastal areas in South West England such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. The growing season lasts for more than 310 days per year, and the borough is in <b>Hardiness</b> zone 9.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} types of birds used in the game, distinguished by their color and shape. In the earliest levels only the basic red bird is available. As the player advances through the game additional types of birds become available. Some birds are effective against particular materials, and some have special abilities that may be activated by the player while the bird is airborne. For example, a yellow bird speeds up, a blue bird fragments into three birds, a black bird explodes, a white bird can drop an egg-shaped projectile, a pink bird can trap objects in bubbles, a green bird boomerangs back and an orange bird expands and inflates. The pigs also vary, with <b>hardiness</b> relative to their size. Small pigs are weaker and are easily vanquished by direct hits or by debris from the damaged structures, while larger pigs are able to withstand more damage before succumbing to defeat. In addition, some pigs wear hats or armor, making them even more resistant to damage.|$|E
