5|$|Bone {{grafting}} {{is necessary}} {{when there is}} a lack of bone. While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 10mm in bone height, and 6mm in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+mm of bone, B=7–9mm, C=4–6mm and D=0–3mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{performed}} a prospective, random-ized clinical trial {{to determine whether}} continuous in-fusion of bupivacaine hydrochloride decreased the use of narcotics for the relief of pain after an amputation. Twenty-one patients who <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> amputation of the lower extremity because of ischemic necrosis secondary to peripheral vascular disease {{were divided into two}} groups with use of a table of random numbers. Group A (the treatment group) included nine patients who <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> transtibial amputation, one patient who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> disarticulation at the knee, and one patient who <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> transfemoral amputation.

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, a refractive cornea is only useful out of water; in water, {{there is}} little difference in refractive index between the vitreous fluid and the surrounding water. Hence creatures that {{have returned to the}} water – penguins and seals, for example – lose their highly curved cornea and return to lens-based vision. An alternative solution, borne by some divers, <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> very strongly focusing cornea.|$|E

Any interconnection to Ontario, however, would need the support of both the Quebec Government and the federal government, as the transmission of electricity generated in Labrador must run through Quebec.|$|E

25|$|One form of buffet <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> display counter {{or table}} filled with plates {{containing}} fixed portions of food; customers select plates containing whichever dishes they want {{as they walk}} along. The food display may either be staffed, or the customers may pick up the food plates themselves. This form is most commonly seen in cafeterias. Another derivative {{of this type of}} buffet occurs where patrons choose food from a buffet style layout and then pay based on what was chosen (sometimes based on the weight of the food, or color-coded plates).|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a {{strategy}} {{that is based on}} risk is portfolio theory. This suggests that a reasonable response to uncertainty <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> wide portfolio of possible responses. In the case of climate change, mitigation can be viewed as an effort to reduce the chance of climate change impacts (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.24). Adaptation acts as insurance against the chance that unfavourable impacts occur. The risk associated with these impacts can also be spread. As part of a policy portfolio, climate research can help when making future decisions. Technology research can help to lower future costs.|$|E

25|$|The first {{affirmation}} {{is to hold}} fast {{to tradition}} and the family. Family {{is seen as the}} main mechanism by which traditions are preserved. For instance, in marriage or birth, tradition is potentially observed and passed onto future generations. The second affirmation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> love of nature. Nature objects are worshipped as sacred, because the kami inhabit them. Therefore, to be in contact with nature means to be in contact with the gods. The third affirmation is to maintain physical cleanliness. Followers of Shinto take baths, wash their hands, and rinse out their mouths often. The last affirmation is to practice matsuri, which is the worship and honor given to the kami and ancestral spirits.|$|E
25|$|Another option <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> head {{official}} or {{remaining members}} of the elected body appoint a new member to fulfill the vacancy. In Australia, for example, the state legislatures appoint replacements members to the Australian Senate, now done {{at the suggestion of}} the party of the outgoing senator. Before this rule, disputes over Senate vacancies contributed to the Australian constitutional crisis of 1975, ultimately resulting in a 1977 amendment to the Constitution of Australia to provide that the legislature must elect a member of the same party as the outgoing senator. Vacancies in the New South Wales Legislative Council are filled in a similar way by a joint sitting of both the legislative council and assembly.|$|E
25|$|On March23, 2007, the Government of Ontario {{announced}} an Environmental Impact Assessment for a four lane controlled-access highway between Kitchener, and Guelph, as traffic on Highway401 is growing steadily and approaching capacity, {{along with the}} current two-lane alignment of Highway7. This would connect to the Conestoga Parkway via {{an expansion of the}} existing Wellington Road interchange, the new junction would be a four level interchange; the government's eventual plan <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> Highway7 freeway running from Stratford to Guelph.
