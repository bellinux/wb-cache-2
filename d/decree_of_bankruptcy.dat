40|$|Abstract. In Lithuania, <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> {{natural persons}} is a {{relatively}} new subject that has been scientifically only randomly dealt with. The bill <b>of</b> <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> Natural Persons in Lithuania was proposed as early as in spring 2009 (No. XIP- 450, 24. 03. 2009). The bill met with a considerable amount of criticism and was postponed for further improvement. By <b>decree</b> No. 413 <b>of</b> April 7, 2010, the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approved the concept <b>of</b> the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons of the Republic of Lithuania. The principal goal of the concept was to consolidate the main provisions of the future law. The Law <b>of</b> <b>Bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> Natural Persons of the Republic of Lithuania has come into effect since March 1, 2013. The authors of the article overview the concept and models <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons and introduce the advantages and shortcomings of the institute <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons. Based on scientific sources of Lithuanian and foreign authors, the article offers a theoretically systemized version of the main reasons determining the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons. The reasons fall into two categories – economic and social. The article is mainly targeted at defining the reasons that determine the <b>bankruptcy</b> <b>of</b> natural persons in Lithuania. To achieve this goal, a quantitative survey of the questionnaires of natural persons affected by bankruptcy has been taken for the basis. In their questionnaires, the natural persons affected by bankruptcy have been asked to evaluate the reasons <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy.</b> The results have been analyzed with the help of factor analysis and statistically processed using the SPSS statistical software package.

Subchapter One defines the term <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> and the development of its meaning over the years. Subchapter Two describes the systematic of the Insolvency Act (Act No. 182 / 2006 Coll.

40|$|This report {{looks at}} the basis and {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> law in the Czech Republic and the impact <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> on various sections of Czech society. The current legal framework is founded on the Bankruptcy and Settlement Act of 1991 and has been amended seven times, the most recent and significant of these being the 1996 amendment. As a consequence of these changes, the law now represents a reasonably functional mechanism for bringing about bankruptcy and settlement. The number <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> cases coming to court grew rapidly in the period 1992 - 1996. However, because of the shortcomings <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> legislation, {{the vast majority of}} these cases became stuck in the courts, while settlement of such cases was almost non-existent. The 1996 amendment sought to address the loopholes in the law which allowed indebted businesses to prolong or avoid bankruptcy declaration, principally by restricting the availability of the so-called „protection period“. The lack of expertise within the Czech legal fraternity has contributed to the slow processing <b>of</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> cases.
