25|$|Nearly every {{freshwater}} fish species of France {{can be found}} in the Loire river basin, that is, about 57 species from 20 families. Many of them are migratory, with 11 species ascending the river for spawning. The most common species are the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), sea trout (Salmo trutta), shads (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax), sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) European river lamprey (Lampetra fluviatilis) and smelt (Osmerus eperlanus). The European eel (Anguilla anguilla) is common in the upper streams, whereas the flounder (Platichtys flesus) and flathead mullet (Mugil spp.) tend to stay near the river mouth. The tributaries host brown trout (Salmo trutta), <b>European</b> <b>bullhead</b> (Cottus gobio), European brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), zander (Sander lucioperca), nase (Chondrostoma nasus and C. toxostoma) and wels catfish (Siluris glanis). The endangered species include grayling (Thymallus thymallus), burbot (Lota lota) and bitterling (Rhodeus sericeus) and the non-native species are represented by the rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris).|$|E
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>bullhead</b> (Cottus gobio) is a {{freshwater}} fish that is widely distributed in Europe, mainly in rivers. It {{is a member}} of the Cottidae family, a type of sculpin.

40|$|International audienceThe {{use of a}} {{biochemical}} multi-biomarker approach proved {{insufficient to}} obtain clear information about ecosystem health. The fish immune system is considered as an attractive non-specific marker for environmental biomonitoring which has direct implications in individual fitness and population growth. Thus, the present work proposes the use of fish immunomarkers together with more common biochemical biomarkers in sampling conditions optimized to reduce biomarker variability and increase parameter robustness. <b>European</b> <b>bullheads</b> (Cottus sp.) from 11 stations in the Artois-Picardie watershed (France) were sampled. In the multiple discriminant analysis, the sites were highly correlated with apoptosis, respiratory burst, GST and EROD activities. Moreover, the use together of biochemical and immune markers increased the percentage of fish correctly classed at each site and enhanced site separation. This study argues {{in favor of the}} utilization of apoptosis, necrosis and respiratory burst for the determination of environmental risk assessment in addition to the set of biochemical biomarkers commonly used in fish...|$|R

50|$|The alpine {{bullhead}} {{has a large}} broad {{head and}} tapering body, large fins and a rounded tail. It is light brown mottled with darker colour. The eyes are located {{near the top of}} the head. This fish resembles the <b>European</b> <b>bullhead</b> and can occur in same streams with it. It can be told from the <b>European</b> <b>bullhead</b> by the fact that the innermost ray of its pelvic fins is shorter than the outermost ray rather than being of similar length. The pelvic fins are spotted with darker colour and appear banded when bunched unlike the European bullhead's clear fins. When the fish rests on the bottom, the pectoral fins flare out resembling wings. The alpine bullhead is usually about 5 to 8 cm long with a maximum of 12 cm.|$|E

5000|$|Cottus microstomus is {{a species}} of sculpin, a European {{freshwater}} fish in the Cottidae family. It is widespread in the Dniester drainage (Black Sea basin), Odra and Vistula drainages (southern Baltic basin), most likely extending further east to the Gulf of Finland. It {{is part of the}} wider European Cottus gobio complex, and possibly makes hybrid zones with Cottus gobio (<b>European</b> <b>bullhead)</b> and Cottus koshewnikowi. [...] It is a demersal fish, up to 10.1 cm long.|$|E
5000|$|The park is {{home for}} one third (1.116) of all {{species of plants}} {{that can be found}} in Tyrol of which 392 species are {{considered}} [...] "valuable" [...] and [...] "endangered". Furthermore, the wild river bed consists of rubble and sand and the form is shifting with every flood. Together with the meadows, this ecosystem hosts much wildlife such as birds, amphibians, insects, spiders (Arctosa cinerea), stone crayfish and other fish species like the <b>European</b> <b>bullhead.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The <b>European</b> <b>bullhead,</b> as treated above, is {{widespread}} {{over most of}} the subcontinent and in England, but absent from the southern peninsulae and from Northern Scandinavia. It is not a single uniform taxon, however, but composed of morphologically and genetically differentiated subunits. Some of those have been distinguished already long time ago as separate subspecies or species with their own names, while in practice they have still mostly been treated under the concept of Cottus gobio. In 2005, Freyhof et al. suggested subdivision of the European Cottus gobio into fourteen distinct species, of which six had been described earlier and eight were newly described and named.|$|E
50|$|Bästeträsk is a {{freshwater}} reserve {{with very}} clean inflows, {{a number of}} them has the same aspects as drinking water. The water has a greenish tint with low content of nutrients, making the lake almost void of vegetation save for stands of Chara aspera, Chara tomentosa, Chara globularis and the only occurrence in Sweden of Nitella tenuissima. It inhabits species such as northern pike, perch, roach, rudd, tench, <b>european</b> <b>bullhead</b> and whitefish. The lake was stocked with crayfish during the 1920s. A number of rare lichens and polyporales {{can be found in the}} nature reserve surrounding the lake, along with the Cochlicopa nitens land snail. The islands in the lake have a large colony of eiders.|$|E
50|$|The fourhorn sculpin {{has a large}} knobbly {{head with}} {{protruding}} lips and four bony protuberances, though the latter are not present in freshwater, lake forms of this fish. The pectoral fins are large and rounded. Freshwater forms resemble the Alpine bullhead and <b>European</b> <b>bullhead</b> but can be distinguished from them {{by the fact that}} the dorsal and anal fins terminate further forward giving a greater length to the caudal peduncle. The head, body and fins are brownish, mottled and barred with darker colour. The belly of the male is yellowish-brown while that of the female is whitish. In the sea this fish reaches 20 to 30 cm but in lakes it seldom exceeds 15 cm.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{endangered}} species of waterfowl {{can be found}} at the Radolfzeller Aach, including snipe, sandpiper and green sandpiper. [...] In the estuary, beavers established themselves in 1998, after having been absent for 200 years. [...] Hydromorphologically, the Radolfzeller Aach is the lower end of trout and mullet territory. The dominant fish species in the Aach is the brown trout, as grayling are less shy and consequently more exposed to the feeding pressure of the large cormorant colony in the Radolfzeller Aach Ried. There are also noticeable stocks of some other endangered fish species, such as lamprey and <b>European</b> <b>bullhead,</b> who enjoy their protection close to the bottom of the river. In the lower reaches, we also find other species from Lake Constance.|$|E
