50|$|Mineral oil is {{generally}} {{effective as a}} transformer oil, but it has some serious disadvantages, of which the worst is its high flammability. If a transformer leaks mineral oil, it can easily start a fire. Fire codes often require that transformers inside buildings use a less flammable liquid, {{or the use of}} <b>dry-type</b> transformers with no liquid at all. Mineral oil is also an environmental contaminant, and its insulating properties are rapidly degraded by even small amounts of water.|$|E

5000|$|A {{specific}} gene {{has been}} identified that determines whether people have wet or dry earwax. The difference in cerumen type has been tracked to a single base change (a single nucleotide polymorphism) in a gene known as [...] "ATP-binding cassette C11 gene". <b>Dry-type</b> individuals are homozygous for adenine whereas wet-type requires at least one guanine. Wet-type earwax is associated with armpit odor, which is increased by sweat production. The researchers conjecture that the reduction in sweat or body odor was beneficial to the ancestors of East Asians and Native Americans who {{are thought to have}} lived in cold climates.|$|E
5000|$|The {{non-functional}} ABCC11 allele is predominant among East Asians (80-95%), {{but very}} low in other ancestral groups (0-3%).

East Asians (Chinese, Koreans, and Japanese) have fewer apocrine sweat glands compared to people of other descent, making East Asians less prone to body odor. The reduction in body odor and sweating may be due to adaptation to colder climates by their ancient Northeast Asian ancestors.|$|E

50|$|Small <b>dry-type</b> and liquid-immersed {{transformers}} {{are often}} self-cooled by natural convection and radiation heat dissipation. As power ratings increase, transformers are often cooled by forced-air cooling, forced-oil cooling, water-cooling, or combinations of these. Large transformers {{are filled with}} transformer oil that both cools and insulates the windings. Transformer oil is a highly refined mineral oil that cools the windings and insulation by circulating within the transformer tank. The mineral oil and paper insulation system has been extensively studied and used for more than 100 years. It is estimated that 50% of power transformers will survive 50 years of use, that {{the average age of}} failure of power transformers is about 10 to 15 years, and that about 30% of power transformer failures are due to insulation and overloading failures. Prolonged operation at elevated temperature degrades insulating properties of winding insulation and dielectric coolant, which not only shortens transformer life but can ultimately lead to catastrophic transformer failure. With a great body of empirical study as a guide, transformer oil testing including dissolved gas analysis provides valuable maintenance information. This underlines the need to monitor, model, forecast and manage oil and winding conductor insulation temperature conditions under varying, possibly difficult, power loading conditions.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{modeling}} in the {{transient condition}} {{is very important}} for cast-resin <b>dry-type</b> transformers. In the present research, two novel dynamic thermal models have been introduced for the cast-resin <b>dry-type</b> transformer. These models are based on two artificial neural networks: the Elman recurrent networks (ELRN) and the nonlinear autoregressive model process with exogenous input (NARX). Using the experimental data, the introduced neural network thermal models have been trained. By selecting a typical transformer, the trained thermal models are validated using additional experimental results and the traditional thermal models. It is shown that the introduced neural network based thermal models have a good performance in temperature prediction of the winding and the cooling air in the cast-resin <b>dry-type</b> transformer. The introduced thermal models are more accurate for the temperature analysis of this transformer and they will be trained easily.

40|$|<b>Dry-type</b> air-core reactor is {{now widely}} applied in {{electrical}} power distribution systems, {{for which the}} optimization design is a crucial issue. In the optimization design problem of <b>dry-type</b> air-core reactor, the objectives of minimizing the production cost and minimizing the operation cost are both important. In this paper, a multiobjective optimal model is established considering simultaneously the two objectives of minimizing the production cost and minimizing the operation cost. To solve the multi-objective optimization problem, a memetic evolutionary algorithm is proposed, which combines elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm version II (NSGA-II) with a local search strategy based on the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES). NSGA-II can provide decision maker with flexible choices among the different trade-off solutions, while the local-search strategy, which is applied to nondominated individuals randomly selected from the current population in a given generation and quantity, can accelerate the convergence speed. Furthermore, another modification is that an external archive {{is set in the}} proposed algorithm for increasing the evolutionary efficiency.
