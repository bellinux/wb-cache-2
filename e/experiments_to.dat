5|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD {{from the}} University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez {{went to work}} for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California in Berkeley. Alvarez devised a set of <b>experiments</b> <b>to</b> observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron.|$|E

5|$|Flemish {{metallurgist}} and alchemist P. M. de Respour {{reported that}} he had extracted metallic zinc from zinc oxide in 1668. By the start of the 18th century, Étienne François Geoffroy described how zinc oxide condenses as yellow crystals on bars of iron placed above zinc ore that is being smelted. In Britain, John Lane is said to have carried out <b>experiments</b> <b>to</b> smelt zinc, probably at Landore, prior to his bankruptcy in 1726.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, {{when the}} Parisian saltpetre {{manufacturer}} Bernard Courtois made iodine {{for the first}} time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake <b>experiments</b> <b>to</b> isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.|$|E

5|$|In his {{lab at the}} Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Nuttin {{designed}} <b>experiments</b> <b>to</b> {{test the}} hypothesis that people place a higher value on letters that feature in their name. It was crucial to the experimental design to rule out other factors, particularly mere exposure. If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{subsequent}} expeditions, {{the crew}} of Expedition 1 had a somewhat modest amount of science <b>experiments</b> <b>to</b> conduct, due to the priority placed on station construction. The plasma crystal experiment, known as PKE-Nefedov, {{was one of the}} first natural science experiments conducted on the space station.

5|$|An {{additional}} 4.6 billion tonnes {{of uranium}} {{are estimated to}} be in sea water (Japanese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using ion exchangers was technically feasible). There have been <b>experiments</b> <b>to</b> extract uranium from sea water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, ORNL researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|At Edinburgh University, Childe {{focused on}} research, and {{although}} reportedly very kind towards his students, had difficulty speaking to large audiences; he organised the BSc degree course {{so that it}} began studying the Iron Age, progressing chronologically backward to the Palaeolithic, confusing many students.
