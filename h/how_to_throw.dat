5|$|Impressed by Rivera's pitching, Yankees {{management}} {{chose not}} to re-sign Wetteland in the offseason, opting instead to replace him as closer with Rivera. In April 1997, MLB retired the uniform number 42 league-wide to honor Jackie Robinson for breaking the baseball color line, although Rivera was among a dozen players allowed to continue wearing the number per a grandfather clause. Rivera's transition from setup man to closer in 1997 was not seamless; he blew three of his first six save opportunities and indicated that he was initially uncomfortable in the role. With reassurance from manager Joe Torre, Rivera settled into the ninth-inning role, and he earned his first All-Star selection with 27saves and a 1.96ERA at the midseason break. In the 1997 All-Star Game, he pitched a perfect ninth inning to collect his first save in an All-Star Game. That summer, he added a cut fastball to his pitching repertoire after accidentally discovering <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> the pitch. Rivera finished the regular season with 43saves in 52opportunities with a 1.88ERA. His first year as closer ended with a blown save in Game 4 of the 1997 AL Division Series against the Cleveland Indians; with the Yankees four outs from advancing to {{the next round of}} the postseason, Rivera allowed a game-tying home run to Sandy Alomar Jr. The Yankees eventually lost that game and the next, eliminating them from the postseason.|$|E

25|$|The {{two biggest}} moves the Astros {{made in the}} offseason were the {{acquisitions}} of Joe Niekro and José Cruz. The Astros bought Niekro from the Braves for almost nothing. Niekro had bounced around the big leagues with minimal success. His older brother Phil Niekro had started teaching Joe <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> his knuckleball and Joe {{was just starting to}} use it {{when he came to the}} Astros. Niekro won six games, saved four games and had an ERA of 3.07. José Cruz was also a steal, in retrospect, from the Cardinals. Cruz became a fixture in the Astros' outfield for several years and would eventually have his number 25 retired.|$|E

25|$|Heston and Boyd {{both had}} to learn how to drive a chariot. Heston, an {{experienced}} horseman, took daily three-hour lessons in chariot driving after he arrived in Rome and picked up the skill quickly. (He also learned sword fighting, <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a javelin, camel riding, and rowing.) Heston was outfitted with special contact lenses to prevent the grit kicked up during the race from injuring his eyes. Boyd, however, needed four weeks of training to feel comfortable (but not expert) at driving the quadriga. For the other charioteers, six actors with extensive experience with horses were flown in from Hollywood. Local actors also portrayed charioteers. Among them were Giuseppe Tosi, who had once been a bodyguard for Victor Emmanuel III of Italy.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{lived in}} San Diego's North Park {{neighborhood}} (4121 Utah Street). At {{the age of}} eight, he was taught <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a baseball by his uncle, Saul Venzor. Saul {{was one of his}} mother's four brothers, as well as a former semi-professional baseball player who had pitched against Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, and Joe Gordon in an exhibition game. As a child, Williams' heroes were Pepper Martin of the St. Louis Cardinals and Bill Terry of the New York Giants. Williams graduated from Herbert Hoover High School in San Diego, where he played baseball as a pitcher and was the star of the team. Though he had offers from the St. Louis Cardinals and the New York Yankees while he was still in high school, his mother thought he was too young to leave home, so he signed up with the local minor league club, the San Diego Padres.|$|E
25|$|A {{native of}} East Greenville, Pennsylvania, Faut {{grew up in}} the home of a working-class family. She was the second oldest {{daughter}} of Robert Faut, an automobile plant worker and park guard, and Eva (nee Gebert) Faut, a housewife. The young Jean, along with her two sisters and three brothers, were raised during the Great Depression era. The children were instructed by their parents to live frugally, save, and avoid debt. Unlike most AAGPBL players, Faut never played softball while growing up and had no previous professional experience. She attended East Greenville High School, where she excelled in track and field, basketball and field hockey. She also pitched batting practice for the school baseball team and hurled in exhibition games against the Cubs, a semiprofessional team in her hometown. In the process, she learned <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> different pitches. After graduating from EGHS in 1942, Faut worked in a clothing factory until the spring of 1946, when she attended a tryout for the AAGPBL in Pascagoula, Mississippi.|$|E

500|$|Wilhelm {{was noted}} {{during this period}} for his {{mentoring}} of relief pitcher Wilbur Wood, {{who came to the}} 1967 White Sox in a trade. Wood sometimes threw a knuckleball upon his arrival in Chicago, but Wilhelm encouraged him to throw it full-time. By 1968, Wood won 13 games, saved 16 games and earned a 1.87 ERA. He credited Wilhelm with helping him to master the knuckleball, as the White Sox coaches did not know much about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> it. Between 1968 and 1970, Wood pitched in more games (241) than any other pitcher and more innings (...) than any other relief pitcher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{answer to}} this lies in a player's {{position}} on the board. Is this {{the beginning of the}} game, and is the player willing to chance a loss for a hoped-for big gain?

500|$|Early in {{his major}} league career, Rivera was a [...] "power pitcher" [...] who relied on an overpowering four-seam fastball that topped out at [...] to retire hitters. By {{enticing}} them to swing and miss at pitches {{high in the}} strike zone, he accumulated strikeouts at a high rate. Rivera changed his pitching style after accidentally discovering <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a cutter in June 1997; during his daily warm-up tosses with teammate Ramiro Mendoza, Rivera noticed that his fastballs were moving sharply and unpredictably, a problem that began to occur in games as well. After unsuccessfully spending a month trying to eliminate the movement, Rivera relented and incorporated the cutter into his pitching repertoire, eventually {{making it one of}} his primary pitches in 1998. When asked about the pitch's origin, he explained, [...] "It was just from God. I didn't do anything. It was natural." [...] As he came to rely on the cutter, Rivera began to record more outs on batted balls. Consequently, his strikeout rate decreased in subsequent years, dropping from 10.87strikeouts per 9innings in 1996 to 5.3 in 1998, but at the benefit of more efficiency; his pitches per inning rate dropped from 18.7 in 1995 to 14.9 in 1998.|$|E
500|$|Boudreau {{discussed}} the potential move to pitcher with Yankees catcher Bill Dickey, {{who had also}} played in the Navy with Lemon. [...] "I knew Lemon had a strong arm, and once I realized {{he was not going}} to hit with consistency as an outfielder, I thought it would be worthwhile to look at him as a pitcher", Boudreau later wrote. Lemon resisted the idea at first, but he agreed to the change after he learned that his salary could be higher as a pitcher. Lemon credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him to adjust to his new position. Indians pitching coach Mel Harder taught Lemon <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>throw</b> a slider, a key pitch in his repertoire. That same year, Indians owner Bill Veeck said that Lemon [...] "some day will become the best pitcher in the American League." [...] Lemon finished the 1946 season with a losing record (4–5), the only one he would have until 1957, and a career-low 2.49ERA. He followed up his inaugural season as a pitcher with an 11–5 record. He appeared in 19 games before August, largely as a relief pitcher, but he made his first start in July against the Boston Red Sox. During the last two months of the season, Lemon went 9–3 and pitched six complete games, including two 11-inning outings.|$|E

In complement with this strategy, Maddux popularized a tactic of throwing his two-seam fastball off the plate inside to left-handed hitters, only to have the ball break back over the inside corner for a strike.
