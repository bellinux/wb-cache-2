40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} tribological contacts between the tensioning <b>guide</b> <b>and</b> toothed chain generally used in the combustion engines. First, it is identified geometry which defines the contact between the tensioning <b>guide</b> <b>and</b> the toothed chain. To determine the pressure distribution in the contact area between tensioning <b>guide</b> <b>and</b> links is necessary to resolve the Reynolds equation. So, a general methodology is proposed for contacts of this type. Then, the mathematical modeling and numerical solution obtained are presented for a specific optimization problem of the tensioning <b>guide</b> <b>and</b> link contact...|$|R
