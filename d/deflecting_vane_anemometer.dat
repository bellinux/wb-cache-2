The general idea behind the proposed approach is to consider the wind turbine rotor as an anemometer.

Measurements of wind conditions obtained this way are not affected by the usual disturbances of existing sensors, for example when installed in the nacelle or in the rotor wake. Furthermore, the approach provides rotor-equivalent quantities, and not the typical point information provided by wind <b>vanes,</b> <b>anemometers</b> or other similar sensors, whose information might be too local for large rotors.

40|$|Many {{physiological}} disorders {{of fruit}} {{are associated with}} low fruit calcium status. This is true for kiwifruit in which fruit storage quality {{is closely related to}} fruit calcium concentration. It is well known that calcium transport to a fruit is exclusively via the xylem - calcium is not phloem mobile. Therefore, a fruit’s calcium status will depend on the cumulative inflow of xylem sap through the stalk; this will depend on fruit transpiration, and on the microenvironment in which the fruit develops. A plausible hypothesis says that if the windspeed around a developing fruit is increased, fruit transpiration will be increased, and likewise the accumulation of fruit calcium. To test this hypothesis, trials were conducted, on 10 -year-old kiwifruit vines (Actinidia deliciosa 'Hayward') growing in Palmerston North, New Zealand. At fruit set, 12 small electric fans were mounted in the canopy to modify the wind environment of the immediately adjacent fruit.

40|$|Abstract—Aerial cargo delivery, {{also known}} as airdrop, systems are heavily {{affected}} by atmospheric wind conditions. Guided air-drop systems typically employ onboard wind velocity estimation methods to predict the wind in real time as the systems descend, but these methods provide no foresight of the winds near the ground. Unexpected ground winds can result in large errors in landing lo-cation, and they can even lead to damage or complete loss of the cargo if the system impacts the ground while traveling downwind. This paper reports on a ground-based mechatronic system consist-ing of a cup and <b>vane</b> <b>anemometer</b> coupled to a guided airdrop system through a wireless transceiver. The guidance logic running on the airdrop system’s onboard autopilot is modified to integrate the anemometer measurements at ground level near the intended landing zone with onboard wind estimates to provide an improved, real-time estimate of the wind profile.

40|$|Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center have {{developed}} a new air-mass-flow sensor {{to solve the problems}} of existing mass flow sensor designs. NASA's design consists of thin-film resistors in a Wheatstone bridge arrangement. The resistors are fabricated on a thin, constant-thickness airfoil to minimize disturbance to the airflow being measured. The following photograph shows one of NASA s prototype sensors. In comparison to other air-mass-flow sensor designs, NASA s thin-film sensor is much more robust than hot wires, causes less airflow disturbance than pitot tubes, is more accurate than <b>vane</b> <b>anemometers,</b> and is much simpler to operate than thermocouple rakes. NASA s thin-film air-mass-flow sensor works by converting the temperature difference seen at each leg of the thin-film Wheatstone bridge into a mass-flow rate. The following figure shows a schematic of this sensor with air flowing around it. The sensor operates as follows: current is applied to the bridge, which increases its temperature. If there is no flow, all the arms are heated equally, the bridge remains in balance, and there is no signal. If there is flow, the air passing over the upstream legs of the bridge reduces the temperature of the upstream legs and that leads to reduced electrical resistance for those legs. After the air has picked up heat from the upstream legs, it continues and passes over the downstream legs of the bridge. The heated air raises the temperature of these legs, increasing their electrical resistance. The resistance difference between the upstream and downstream legs unbalances the bridge, causing a voltage difference that can be amplified and calibrated to the airflow rate. Separate sensors mounted on the airfoil measure the temperature of the airflow, which is used to complete the calculation for the mass of air passing by the sensor. A current application for air-mass-flow sensors is as part of the intake system for an internal combustion engine. A mass-flow sensor is used to provide accurate information about the amount of air entering the engine so that the amount of fuel can be adjusted to give the most efficient combustion. The ideal mass-flow sensor would be a rugged design that minimizes the disturbance to the flow stream and provides an accurate reading of both smooth and turbulent flows; NASA's design satisfies these requirements better than any existing design. Most of the mass-flow sensors used today are the hot wire variety. Hot wires can be fragile and cannot accurately measure a turbulent or reversing flow, which is often encountered in an intake manifold. Other types of mass-flow sensors include pitot tubes, <b>vane</b> <b>anemometers,</b> and thermocouple rakes-all of which suffer from some type of performance problem. Because it solves these performance problems while maintaining a simple design that lends itself to low-cost manufacturing techniques, NASA s thin-film resistance temperature detector air-mass-flow sensor should lead to more widespread use of mass-flow sensors...|$|R

40|$|A nonlinear, six degree-of-freedom flight {{simulator}} for a twin engine tactical jet {{was built on}} a hybrid computer to investigate lateral vectoring of the remaining thrust component for {{the case of a}} single engine failure at low dynamic pressures. Aircraft control was provided by an automatic controller rather than a pilot, and thrust vector control was provided by an open-loop controller that <b>deflected</b> a <b>vane</b> (located on the periphery of each exhaust jet and normally streamlined for noninterference with the flow). Lateral thrust vectoring decreased peak values of lateral control deflections, eliminated the requirement for steady-state lateral aerodynamic control deflections, and decreased the amount of altitude lost for a single engine failure...|$|R
