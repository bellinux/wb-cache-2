5000|$|When {{former vice}} U.S. President Gerald R.

Although the USSR {{was looking for a}} rapid resolution, none of the parties were quick to make concessions, particularly on human rights points.

5000|$|During {{his second}} exile, Mohammad Reza {{travelled}} {{from country to}} country seeking what he hoped would be temporary residence. First he flew to Aswan, Egypt, where he received a warm and gracious welcome from President Anwar El-Sadat. He later lived in Marrakesh, Morocco as a guest of King Hassan II. Mohammad Reza loved to support royalty during his time as Shah and one of those who benefitted had been Hassan, who received an interest-free loan of $110 million US dollars from his friend Mohammad Reza. Mohammad Reza expected Hassan to return the favor, but he soon learned Hassan had other motives. Richard Parker, the American ambassador to Morocco reported [...] "The Moroccans believed the Shah was worth about $2 billion dollars, and they wanted to take their share of the loot". After leaving Morocco, Mohammad Reza lived in Paradise Island, in the Bahamas, and in Cuernavaca, Mexico, near Mexico City, as a guest of José López Portillo. Richard Nixon, the former president, visited the Shah in summer 1979 in Mexico. An American doctor, Dr. Benjamin Kean who examined Mohammad Reza in Cuernavaca later wrote:"There was no longer any doubt. The atmosphere had changed completely. The Shah's appearance was stunningly worse ... Clearly he had obstructive jaundice. The odds favored gallstones, since his fever, chills and abdominal distress suggested an infection of the biliary tract. Also he had a history of indigestion. Besides the probable obstruction-he now had been deeply jaundiced for six to eight weeks-he was emaciated and suffering from hard tumor nodes in the neck and a swollen spleen, signs that his cancer was worsening, and he had severe anemia and very low white blood counts". The Shah suffered from gallstones that would require prompt surgery. He was offered treatment in Switzerland, but insisted on treatment in the United States. President Carter did not wish to admit Mohammad Reza to the United States, but came under pressure from many quarters with <b>Dr.</b> <b>Kissinger</b> phoning Carter to say he would not endorse the SALT II treaty that Carter had just signed with the Soviet Union unless the former Shah was allowed into the United States, promoting him more than once to hang his phone in rage in the Oval Office and shout [...] "Fuck the Shah!". As many Republicans were attacking the SALT II treaty as an American give-away to the Soviet Union, Carter was anxious to have the endorsement of a Republican elder statesmen like <b>Dr.</b> <b>Kissinger</b> to fend off this criticism. Mohammad Reza had decided not to tell his Mexican doctors he had cancer, and the Mexican doctors had misdiagnosed his illness as malaria, giving him a regime of anti-malarial drugs that did nothing to treat his cancer, which caused his health to go into rapid decline as he lost 30 pounds. In September 1979, a doctor sent by David Rockefeller reported to the State Department Mohammad Reza needed to come to the United States for medical treatment, an assessment not shared by Dr. Kean who stated that the proper medical equipment for treating Mohammad Reza's cancer could be found in Mexico and the only problem was the former Shah's unwillingness to tell the Mexicans he had cancer. The State Department warned not to admit the former Shah into the US, saying it was likely that the Iranian regime would seize the American embassy in Tehran if that occurred. Milani suggested there was a possible conflict of interest on the part of Rockefeller, noting the Chase Manhattan bank had given Iran a $500 million loan under questionable conditions in 1978 (several lawyers refused to endorse the loan) which placed the money in an account with Chase Manhattan, that the new Islamic republic had making [...] "substantial withdrawals" [...] from its account with Chase Manhattan, and that Rockefeller wanted Mohammad Reza in the US, knowing full well it was likely to cause the Iranians to storm the US embassy, which in turn would cause the US government to freeze Iranian financial assets in America, such as the Iranian account at Chase Manhattan.|$|E

40|$|It is {{impossible}} {{to talk about the}} role of the National Security Advisor without talking about Brent Scowcroft. It is fair to say that Henry Kissinger was the father of the ? inter-agency system? that is still with us today. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Kissinger</b> established the network of committees at various levels within the Executive Branch that bring together representatives of the relevant departments and agencies to address national security and foreign policy issues. But General Scowcroft is the father of the modern-day National Security Advisor. The manner and method by which Brent Scowcroft performed the role became the model or ?base case? for all those who came after him. David Rothkopf, with his authoritative studies of the role of the National Security Advisor and the various individuals who have filled that position, concludes that the ?Scowcroft Model? is the one that best serves the President and our nation?s national security decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|The Albanian - Chinese {{relations}} in {{the years of the}} Cold War were thrilling as much as dramatic. The age of their flourish in the ' 60 -ies, unfortunately did not last for long. The Albanian sponsorship that China be admitted in the UN with full rights was a test that Enver Hoxha should exploit {{for the good of the}} Albanian people. It was a historic and unrepeated opportunity for little Albania to escape the political and economic impasse since the breakup of relations with the Soviet Union in 1961. The incompetence of the Albanian leadership to understand the trends of the age would mark the following political failure of Albania and would influent in the total isolation of the country. It's not difficult to understand that Albania had historic opportunities to join the Western side but chose to align with the Eastern bloc. The beginnings are with sensational approach with Tito's Yugoslavia. After that the Albanian political leadership kept Albania under the umbrella of the Soviet Union and at the end with China. After the end of the relations with China in 1978, Albania paved the way of the total isolation.   The secret visit of the President Nixon's national security adviser <b>Dr.</b> <b>Kissinger</b> to China in July 1971 was interpreted by the Albanian communist leader as a betrayal of the Marxist ideology. Enver Hoxha responded with a harsh and rude letter on August 6 th 1971 urging China to not accept the visit of President Nixon the following year. This was the first major break in the relations between the two countries. Since then, the help from China for the weak Albanian economy would decline till the unavoidable break of July 1978. The methodology used in this paper is strictly comparative history analyzing the way diplomacy and politics should work to achieve the set aim...|$|E
