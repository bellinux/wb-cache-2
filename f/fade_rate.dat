40|$|The {{volcanic}} {{origin of}} the sediments from Sulawesi, Indonesia, provides a particular challenge for luminescence dating due to the dim optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) from quartz, and the high anomalous <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> in the infrared (IR) stimulated luminescence (IRSL) from feldspars. In this study, we present results of dating the sanidine feldspars from 2 samples taken from an archaeological site (Leang Bulu Bettue) in the Maros karsts of South Sulawesi. We tested the post-IR IRSL (pIRIR) procedures {{in order to find}} a stable luminescence signal that is less affected by anomalous fading. It was found that there is a highly variable anomalous <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> in the IRSL and pIRIR signals for different grains and aliquots, and a low temperature IR stimulation (at 50 ◦C or 100 ◦C) used in a pIRIR procedure cannot completely remove the anomalous fading for the subsequent pIRIR signals. The large uncertainties associated with <b>fading</b> <b>rates</b> prevent the application of fading-correction procedures. We propose a method to obtain reliable De estimates by extrapolation of the relationship between De and laboratory <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> (g-value). The resultant luminescence ages show consistency with other radiometric age determinations from the site.

40|$|Abstract—Multicarrier code-division {{multiple}} access (MC-CDMA) combines multicarrier transmission with direct sequence spread spectrum. Recently, different approaches {{have been adopted}} which do not assume a perfectly known channel. In this paper, we examine the forward-link performance of decision-directed adaptive detection schemes, with and without explicit channel estimation, for MC-CDMA systems operating in fast fading channels. We analyze theoretically the impact of channel estimation errors by first considering a simpler system employing a threshold orthogonality restoring combining (TORC) detector with a Kalman channel estimator. We show that the performance deteriorates significantly as the channel <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> increases and that the <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> affects the selection of system parameters. We examine the performance of more realistic schemes based on the {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) criterion using least mean square (LMS) and recursive least square (RLS) adaptation. We present a discussion which compares the decision-directed and pilot-aided approaches and explores the tradeoffs between channel estimation overhead and performance. We find that there is a <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> range where each method provides a good tradeoff between performance and overhead. We conclude that the MMSE per carrier decision-directed detector with RLS estimation combines good performance in low to moderate <b>fading</b> <b>rates,</b> robustness in parameter variations, and relatively low complexity and overhead. For higher <b>fading</b> <b>rates,</b> however, only pilot-symbol-aided detectors are appropriate.

50|$|The {{extended}} {{length of the}} observed light curve found a remarkably uniform 0.01 magnitudes per day decline starting about 60 days after discovery. Translated into other units, this is almost exactly a 77-day half-life, which is the half-life of 56Co. In the standard model for Type Ia supernovae, approximately a solar mass of 56Ni is formed and ejected from a white dwarf which accretes mass from a binary companion and is raised over the Chandrasekhar limit and explodes. This 56Ni decays with a half-life of about 6 days to 56Co, and the decay of the cobalt provides the energy radiated away by the supernova remnant. The model also produces an estimate for the luminosity of such a supernova. The observations of SN1972e, both peak brightness and <b>fade</b> <b>rate,</b> were in general agreement with these predictions, and led to rapid acceptance of this degenerate-explosion model.|$|E

The receiver {{is derived from}} the ML criterion and is shown to mitigate error floor occurring in a conventional differential receiver very well.

It is shown that the receiver is more sensitive to the mismatched parameters when the <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> is high. Then, a union bound on the bit error probability is derived. The bounds show good agreement with the simulation results at high <b>fading</b> <b>rate</b> and at high SNR. Finally, a modified receiver, denoted as multistage receiver, is proposed to compensate the so-called intrablock interference caused by the time-varying characteristic of the channel within a transmission block.
