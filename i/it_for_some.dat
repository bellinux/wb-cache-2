5|$|By 2008, Lukather was {{the only}} remaining, {{original}} Toto member still performing with the band: Bobby Kimball {{was also in the}} band at the time, but earlier had been absent from <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time – whereas Lukather has been with Toto since its formation. However, in June of the same year, Lukather himself decided to leave Toto. This decision directly led to the official dissolution of the band. In a 2011 interview discussing his career with Toto, Lukather indicated that the band had evolved too far from its original incarnation and that he was dealing with the physical and mental toll of recording and performing. In February 2010, the band announced that they would reunite to support Toto bassist Mike Porcaro, who was diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease. They continued to tour on a limited basis in 2011 and 2012.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August, the Battle of Yarmouk was fought, {{it lasted}} for 6 days {{and ended in}} a devastating defeat for the Byzantines. The Battle of Yarmouk is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most decisive battles of history. It was a historic defeat that sealed the fate of Byzantium in the Levant, the magnitude of the defeat was so intense that Byzantine forces were unable to recover from <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. It left the whole of the Byzantine Empire vulnerable to the Muslim Arab armies. The battle was the greatest battle ever fought on Syrian soil up to that point, and is believed to be the tactical marvel of Khalid.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Chicago work {{went on a}} tour {{of eight}} cities before returning to Chicago in 1933 where it was displayed at the World's Fair. It was in a warehouse until it was purchased by Winston-Salem, North Carolina, artist and collector Joseph Wallace King in 1965. King had first seen the painting in 1933 at the Chicago World's Fair. Years later he described the painting and how magnificent it was seeing it displayed in Chicago to his friend Ed Grout of Maryland. Mr. Grout arranged a meeting with the nephew of George McConnel and the painting was purchased by Mr. King. King appeared on the panel game show I've Got A Secret on May 30, 1966, displaying a 22' by 25' section of the painting (his secret was that this was only part of the painting). It was revealed that King had been searching for <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time, and now that he'd found it, he hoped to construct a new cyclorama building.|$|E

5|$|Wallace began {{investigating}} spiritualism in {{the summer}} of 1865, possibly at the urging of his older sister Fanny Sims, who had been involved with <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. After reviewing the literature on the topic and attempting to test the phenomena he witnessed at séances, he came to accept that the belief was connected to a natural reality. For the rest of his life, he remained convinced that at least some séance phenomena were genuine, no matter how many accusations of fraud sceptics made or how much evidence of trickery was produced. Historians and biographers have disagreed about which factors most influenced his adoption of spiritualism. It has been suggested by one biographer that the emotional shock he had received a few months earlier, when his first fiancée broke their engagement, contributed to his receptiveness to spiritualism. Other scholars have preferred to emphasise instead Wallace's desire to find rational and scientific explanations for all phenomena, both material and non-material, of the natural world and of human society.|$|E

25|$|While {{the first}} transfusions {{had to be}} made {{directly}} from donor to receiver before coagulation, it was discovered that by adding anticoagulant and refrigerating the blood it was possible to store <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> days, thus opening the way for the development of blood banks. John Braxton Hicks was the first to experiment with chemical methods to prevent the coagulation of blood at St Mary's Hospital, London in the late 19th century.

Vice-Admiral Robert Otway had ordered him to test the compass belonging to Mr. Alexander, of Leith, and McVicar used <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> nine weeks, finding it {{better than the other}} compasses on Apelles.

25|$|Military {{facilities}} of the United States in Spain built {{during this}} era include Naval Station Rota and Morón Air Base, {{and an important}} facility existed at Torrejón de Ardoz. Torrejón passed under Spanish control in 1988. Rota has been in use since the 1950s. Crucial to Cold War strategy, the base did have nuclear weapons stationed on <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time, and at its peak size, in the early 1980s, was home to 16,000 sailors and their families. The presence of these bases in Spain was resented by many Spaniards; there were occasional protests against them, including a demonstration during Reagan's 1985 visit to Spain.|$|E
25|$|As Yusuf began a new {{campaign}} against Smbat {{in conjunction with}} Gagik in 909, neither the Byzantines nor the Caliph sent aid to Smbat; several Armenian princes also chose to withhold their support. Those who did ally with Smbat were dealt brutally by Yusuf's powerful army: Smbat's son Mushegh, his nephew Smbat Bagratuni, and Grigor II of Western Syunik were all poisoned. Yusuf's army ravaged the rest of Armenia as it advanced towards Blue Fortress, where Smbat had taken refuge, and besieged <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time. Smbat finally decided to surrender himself to Yusuf in 914 in hopes of ending the Arab onslaught; Yusuf, however, showed no compassion towards his prisoner as he tortured the Armenian king to death and put his headless body on display on a cross in Dvin.|$|E

25|$|A {{few months}} later another plane landed in Mexico after its crew {{followed}} the wrong railroad tracks. Patrolling on Monday, 2 February 1920, 1st Lts. Leroy M. Wolfe and George L. Usher intended {{to pick up the}} El Paso and Southwestern Railroad west of Douglas, Arizona, and follow it to Nogales. Visibility was poor and the compass did not work properly. Sighting a railroad, Wolfe and Usher followed <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time until it ended. Lost and having engine trouble, they landed and were taken into custody by Mexican officials. The tracks they had steered by ran due south instead of west, and had led them to Nacozari, Sonora, seventy-five or eighty miles below the border. Though treated well, Wolfe and Usher were not set free until 2 February. They waited three more days for release of their airplane, shipping it to Douglas by train.|$|E
25|$|The raid on Bardia was a {{considerable}} strategic success. Alarmed by it, the Germans diverted {{the greater part}} of an armoured brigade from Sollum, where it was beginning to exert heavy pressure on the Western Desert Force, and kept <b>it</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> time in the rear areas. Layforce—instead of being used as a commando raiding unit—were deployed as normal infantry battalions, a role for which they were neither equipped nor trained. As one of the few reserve forces available, they were sent {{to take part in the}} Battle of Crete; fighting as the rearguard they lost 600 men before being evacuated. Layforce C Battalion was not sent to Crete but instead to Lebanon, where they lost over 120 men fighting in the battle of the Litani River. The steady drain of manpower without the re-supply chain of normal British Army regiments meant that Layforce as a unit was left in an ineffective state and was disbanded in July 1941.|$|E

500|$|Some {{writers have}} {{believed}} David neglected the cooking {{of her own}} country in favour of Mediterranean cuisine. The humorous writer Humphrey Lyttelton held that she preferred [...] "inaccessible and often indigestible saucissons" [...] to [...] "the splendid Cumberland sausage". More recently a British journalist, Tim Hayward, accused her of [...] "wide-eyed romantic twaddle", excessively focused on France and the Mediterranean. Chaney comments that when Spices, Salt and Aromatics in the English Kitchen was published in 1970, some of David's most ardent admirers were taken aback to find her extolling the British culinary tradition, [...] "at its best... as rich and rewarding {{as that of the}} Mediterranean".

[...] The defense side had no experts with direct knowledge of nuclear weapon design, until the unexpected appearance of Ray Kidder, a nuclear weapon designer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. [...] One of Kidder’s jobs in 1962 had been to evaluate designs of the 29 thermonuclear devices tested in Operation Dominic. [...] Kidder was able to credibly dispute government arguments in the battle of affidavits, leveling the technical playing field.

500|$|The Histoire Naturelle, générale et particulière, avec la {{description}} du Cabinet du Roi is {{the work}} that the Comte de Buffon (1707–1788) is remembered for.

It includes all the knowledge available in his time on the [...] "natural sciences", a broad term that includes disciplines which today would be called material science, physics, chemistry and technology. Buffon notes the morphological similarities between men and apes, although he considered apes completely devoid of the ability to think, differentiating them sharply from human beings. Buffon's attention to internal anatomy made him an early comparative anatomist. [...] "L’intérieur, dans les êtres vivants, est le fond du dessin de la nature", he wrote in his Quadrupèdes, [...] "the interior, in living things, is the foundation of nature's design." ...|$|E
