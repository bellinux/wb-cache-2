Expanding the range of participation by promoting a variety of perspectives would produce valuable and useful results.

Today’s {{successful}} manager {{must stay}} abreast with important <b>global</b> <b>trends</b> and should possess the needed managerial competence in information technology, cross-functional abilities, leadership, emotional intelligence, finance, quantitative techniques, communication, interpersonal relationship, and cross-cultural transactions. This correlation study investigated {{if the students}} of Master in Business Administration in various graduate schools in Davao City have been upholding these competencies. A self-assessment questionnaire {{was used to measure}} perceived <b>global</b> <b>trends</b> cognition and management competencies of the students. This study that included students who were holding supervisory positions in their respective companies evaluated their self-perceived <b>global</b> <b>trends</b> cognition as only adequate or satisfactory and so with their self-perceived managerial competence. The data indicated a strong association between variables (r= 0. 79). Squaring the correlation coefficient denoted that 62 percent of the variation in managerial competence was explained by <b>global</b> <b>trends</b> cognition. The satisfactory level of the participants for both variables pointed out that they had not yet attained the highest level in their cognition of <b>global</b> <b>trends</b> and competence in the management of their respective organizations...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a one-year study of Internet packet traffic {{from a large}} campus network, showing that 15 - 25 % of TCP connections {{have at least one}} TCP RST (reset). Similar results have also been observed from measurements of other Internet links. The results in this paper show that reset connections arise from local events such as network outages, attacks, or reconfigurations, as well as from <b>global</b> <b>trends</b> in TCP usage. In particular, we identify application-level Web behaviour as the primary contributor to the <b>global</b> <b>trend</b> in reset TCP connections. The most prevalent anomaly is the absence of the normal FIN handshake for connection termination. Instead, connections are often reset by the client. We believe that particular implementations of HTTP/TCP connection management cause this <b>global</b> <b>trend.</b> ...|$|R
