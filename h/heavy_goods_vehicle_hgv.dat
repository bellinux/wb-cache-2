50|$|A <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> (<b>HGV),</b> also large {{goods vehicle}} (LGV) or medium goods vehicle, is the European Union (EU) term for any truck with a gross {{combination}} mass (GCM) of over 3500 kg.

5000|$|In November 2013, six cyclists {{were killed}} on London streets within a two-week period, {{bringing}} {{the number of}} cyclists killed in London in the year to 14, nine of which involved a <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> (<b>HGV).</b> In response, the Metropolitan Police announced an initiative called Operation Safeway, in which 2,500 traffic police were stationed at major junctions throughout the city to issue fixed penalty notices to road users breaking road traffic laws and offer advice to vulnerable road users. Following the deaths, Boris Johnson stated {{in an interview on}} BBC Radio that cyclists were endangering their lives when not following road traffic laws, making it [...] "very difficult for the traffic engineers to second-guess actions". The comments were immediately condemned as [...] "deflecting blame onto cyclists and grossly insensitive" [...] by Roger Geffen, campaigns and policy director of the Cyclists' Touring Club, and as [...] "dodging responsibility" [...] and [...] "an insult to the dead and injured" [...] by Darren Johnson, the Green Party member of the London Assembly. Former Olympic cyclist Chris Boardman, policy director for British Cycling, the national governing body for cycle racing in Great Britain, called on Johnson to ban HGVs from some London roads during peak hours, saying that Johnson had made a verbal promise to him [...] "to look at the successful experiences of Paris and many other cities in restricting the movements of heavy vehicles during peak hours". Johnson stated in a radio interview that he was unconvinced by the idea, but was however considering banning cyclists from wearing headphones while riding. However, the traffic division of the Metropolitan Police were unable to identify any serious cycling incidents in which headphone use could be identified as a contributing factor.|$|E

40|$|After a {{long period}} of {{political}} debate and technological difficulties, the German <b>heavy</b> <b>goods</b> <b>vehicle</b> (<b>HGV)</b> toll system was finally put into operation in January 2005. This paper is divided into two main parts. The first section discusses the German HGV toll in detail, with a focus on fee calculation. This is followed by an analysis of the macro-economic impact of the toll. Based on an input-output model for the German economy involving 70 distinct industries, undesirable potential price increases are considered along with potential positive employment effects which can be expected if the toll revenue re-enters the economy. ...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} {{feasibility}} and possible benefits of amending the German <b>Heavy</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (<b>HGV)</b> motorway toll system by adopting different pricing and revenue use rules. Economic efficiency and equity effects are assessed using the MOLINO partial equilibrium {{model and the}} ASTRA system dynamics model. Acceptability issues are also addressed using {{the results of a}} survey of actors in the German haulage business. According to first-best welfare theory user charges should be set equal to social marginal costs and the revenues should accrue entirely to the state. However, acceptability and long-term development considerations militate strongly in favour of earmarking revenues to the transport sector. ...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{traditional}} ‘lumped tyre’ dynamic models are only accurate for modelling longitudinal motion at frequencies up to 10 Hz. A simplified rigid-ring tyre model is developed in this paper to model the tyre of a <b>Heavy</b> <b>Goods</b> <b>Vehicle</b> (<b>HGV).</b> Comparisons to field tests of an anti-lock braking system show that the new tyre model predicts the tyre’s response more accurately than conventional models. Simulations with a slip-control braking controller show that treadband dynamics may induce some instability of the control system at low vehicle speeds. A simulation incorporating the tyre model is used to compare a theoretical smart tyre concept against an existing friction force observer. Simulation results show that such a tyre would require four low noise sensors to outperform the friction force observer...|$|E
