40|$|Fortifikationsverket {{which is}} the {{landlord}} for the Swedish national defence has a great problem in their forestry due to the relatively large amount of metal objects in their timber. These metal objects cause different types of economical losses in the timber refinement chain. To enable out sorting of logs containing metal objects already in the harvesting phase, Fortifikationsverket is interested of the possibility to utilize some type of metal detector in a <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> for that purpose. The goal {{of this study was}} to, with help of a case study, enlighten the problem that metal objects in timber cause for Fortifikationsverket and their customers of timber and to investigate conditions of to mount and utilize some kind of metal detector in a <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> at present. The saw timber deliveries by Fortifikationsverket during the time period 2003 - 2005 was used as a reference volume for calculations of economical losses. In this case study was included two sawmills where timber from Fortifikationsverket were delivered to for further refinement. Factors investigated were the type of damage metal objects caused in these two sawmills and the economical signification of these damages. Even the harvesting and managing of Fortifikationsverket´s timber in areas where trees contained relatively much metal objects and the harvesting procedure was investigated by interviewing entrepreneurs. Further, the possibilities to use some type of metal detector on a <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> for out sorting logs containing metal objects were investigated by interviewing scientists and specialists and by literature searches. The interval of damage costs for the sawmills included in this case study was approximately 14 000 – 433 000 SEK. The economical scope for a metal detector amounted to approximately 130 000 SEK for the reference volume when only economical losses due to metal objects in connection with harvesting and transport where taken into consideration. Electromagnetics, X-rays, microwaves and ultrasound are methods which could be used to detect metal objects in timber. The tough environment provided by the <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> and the harvesting technique it self precludes a practical usage of these methods at present, but it could be theoretically possible with the aid of microwave technique...|$|E
40|$|Logging {{harvesters}} {{represent a}} set of high-performance modern forestry machinery, which can finish a series of continuous operations such as felling, delimbing, peeling, bucking and so forth with human intervention. It is found by experiment that {{during the process of}} the alignment of the <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> to capture the trunk, the operator needs a lot of observation, judgment and repeated operations, which lead to the time and fuel losses. In order to improve the operation efficiency and reduce the operating costs, the point clouds for standing trees are collected with a low-cost 2 D laser scanner. A cluster extracting algorithm and filtering algorithm are used to classify each trunk from the point cloud. On the assumption that every cross section of the target trunk is approximate a standard circle and combining the information of an Attitude and Heading Reference System, the radii and center locations of the trunks in the scanning range are calculated by the Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient algorithm. The method is validated through experiments in an aspen forest, and the optimized calculation time consumption is compared with the previous work of other researchers. Moreover, the implementation of the calculation result for automotive capturing trunks by the <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> during the logging operation is discussed in particular...|$|E

Finally, measurements were carried out both at no load, in standard controlled conditions, and in field, under ordinary working conditions. To smooth the influence of external factors, the machines were operated by the same operator. The results showed that the greater and heavier <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> produced significantly higher acceleration at no load (10. 7 m/s 2 vs. 5. 5 m/s 2), and comparable acceleration at load (13. 9 vs. 14. 2 m/s 2).

40|$|Wood fuels make a key {{contribution}} to {{renewable energy sources}} in the Nordic countries. The growing demand for forest biomass can be partly met by utilising energy-rich stumps left after clear cutting. As fuel, stump wood is commonly associated with a high presence of contaminants, resulting in high ash content. The concentration of contaminants depends on factors such as soil type, weather conditions, harvesting method, storage duration and other handling operations. The high ash content is a major drawback when using stump wood as fuel. Handling methods that could improve fuel quality are therefore highly desirable. To produce a fuel of acceptable quality, i. e. with low moisture and ash content and high energy value, the above-mentioned factors require evaluation and quantification. In this thesis, various handling methods within the supply chain for Norway spruce stump and their effects on the biomass as fuel are evaluated. The following handling processes are dealt with: harvesting technique, pre-treatments including stump splitting/fractionation and cleaning using vibration or sieving, storage methods and storage duration. Choice of stump <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> proved {{to have an impact}} on fuel quality, as splitting of stumps during extraction allowed better drying during storage. Such stumps could be stored directly in windrows, since no difference could be established between this method and storage in heaps prior to windrow storage. In general, storage improved fuel quality. Changes in fuel quality parameters do not reflect the whole picture, however, since dry matter losses occur during storage, and therefore the storage period should be kept as short as possible. During winter months, when demands for fuel are highest, stump ash content can be high, since frozen contaminants are difficult to detach from stumps during transport. To achieve acceptable fuel quality during high demand periods, long storage duration or a pre-treatment involving additional stump cleaning is required. Fuel quality was clearly improved by vibration-based cleaning before the comminution of stumps or by sieving stump wood after crushing. These methods can allow stump wood fuel of acceptable quality to be supplied within a harvesting season...|$|E

Coppice stems had been reduced to one stem or two stems per stool or left untreated. Time and piece counts were used to determine harvester productivity. Harvester cycle and elemental times and the number of logs and harvester head passes per stem were obtained from video recordings. Harvester fuel use was determined by refilling the fuel tank to the same point each day. Stem size was the major factor influencing harvester productivity (20. 8 m 3 per productive machine hour without delays [PMH 0], 11. 8 m 3 PMH 0 − 1 and 8. 6 m 3 PMH 0 − 1 in the single-stem (mean stem volume [MSV] 0. 21 m 3), two-stem (MSV 0. 09 m 3) and untreated trial areas (MSV 0. 06 m 3), respectively. Estimated harvester cost (AU$ m– 3) was considerably greater for the two-stem and untreated trial areas, which reflected the lower harvester productivity in these areas. Processing time represented over 60 % of the total cycle time for all trial areas. Coppice characteristics resulted in significantly different moving/positioning times between trial areas. However, this difference had no impact on cycle times. Number of logs per stem was a significant variable in cycle and processing time regressions for all trial areas and felling time for the single-stem trial area. Number of harvester head passes was a significant variable in cycle and processing time regressions for the single-stem trial area and processing times for the two-stem trial area, although its effect was less than that of the number of logs per stem. Fuel consumption (L PMH 0 − 1) was relatively constant between the trial areas, hence harvester energy intensity (L m− 3) reflected the harvester productivity in each trial area...|$|E
40|$|Tree stumps {{could make}} a {{significant}} contribution to the transition from a fossil- to a bio-based economy, but current stump harvesting operations have adverse ecological effects. The ground disturbance caused by the up-rooting leads to increased carbon emissions from the soil and increases risks of leaching of heavy metals and nutrients, while removal of stump wood increases nutrient removal and reduces amounts of dead wood in the forest. However, the ground disturbance could be reduced by introducing new techniques. The overall objective of the studies this thesis is based upon was to investigate possible future systems for stump harvesting capable of reducing ground disturbance, and estimate their economic sustainability. Studies were based on experimental field studies and simulations. The ground disturbance depends on the type of <b>harvesting</b> <b>head,</b> as harvesting the whole stump creates more disturbance than harvesting {{the central part of the}} stump; the ground disturbance is also larger on peat soil than on mineral soil, but does not depend on time since clear cutting; and the root breakage diameter is surprisingly small (5 - 30 mm) after whole stump harvests and is not affected by the time since clear-cutting. Twisting stumps loose requires large torques and cannot be considered a viable way of extraction. The ground disturbance and cost to industry was estimated for four systems: a conventional whole stump harvesting system (WSH), a stump centre harvesting (SCH) system and two possible future systems for integrated harvest and forwarding of stem and stump centres with separation of the stump centres at either the landing (IHL) or industrial sites (IHI). The IHI and SCH systems are estimated to be up to 100 % and 60 % more costly, respectively, than WSH. However, costs of IHL were estimated to be similar with WSH for large trees. WSH (up-rooting) caused five times more ground disturbance per hectare compared to the other systems. In conclusion, the conventional up-rooting system was estimated to be best from an economic perspective, but caused more ground disturbance then harvesting of stump centres only. If ground disturbance restrictions are introduced, and new technologies are developed accordingly, costs of utilizing stump wood will be higher than at present. In development of integrated stump centre harvesting systems, as described here, it is crucial to design techniques and methods that minimize possible risks of damaging the stem wood in order to secure timber quality. Finally, regardless of future regulations, whole stump up-rooting technologies will still be warranted for treating stands infected by root rot...|$|E

The importance of this energy is highly valued because biomass stands for 31, 7 % of Sweden’s energy usage 2009. During this project a crane mounted concept for continuous thinning was developed. The harvester head is designed to be used on 15 - 20 ton harvesters. Within one crane cycle the harvester head should harvest an area of 1 x 10 meters. The aim is to use the harvester head in stands were the diameter in breast height is between 4 - 10 centimeters and the trees are between 5 - 10 meters tall. Data information about young dense stands showed that the total tree mass in the 1 x 10 meter corridor rarely exceeds 300 kg. The harvester head was designed to manage 350 kg within one crane cycle. The required functions for continuous thinning were set to the following sub-functions; separation, accumulation and grading. The main focus was set towards solving problems around continuous accumulation. Earlier studies on conventional harvester heads for thinning showed that felling and positioning for each tree, or groups of trees, stands for 60 - 70 % of the crane work. Existing harvester heads on the market were reviewed. Related technology and patent documents were also investigated. The purpose was to generate alternative solutions for separation and accumulation that differs from conventional techniques. The product development was performed in cooperation with a focus group. The focus group consisted of representatives from Sveaskog and the University of Agricultural Sciences in Umeå. The final concept is equipped with two saw blades and a system for continuous accumulation. The separated trees are pushed upright into the <b>harvesting</b> <b>head</b> with a feeding roller chain. After the feeding mechanism has pushed the trees, a chain made of torus-shaped links accumulates the trees. To verify the sub-function accumulation a physical prototype was built and tested. Conclusions from the test were that the rotation speed of the roller chain should be reduced to a speed under 200 revolutions/minute. Further the feeding system should be improved with four chains instead of two. The prototype tests showed that continuous accumulation is possible. Validerat; 20110209 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|During {{the year}} 2006, climatic {{conditions}} were favourable for {{the appearance of}} head blight {{in the majority of}} localities in which wheat was grown in our country. In the locality of Apatin, in certain plots, the amount of detected infection was up to 25 infected heads per m 2. During the <b>harvest,</b> <b>heads</b> with distinct disease symptoms and sporulation of Fusarium graminearum fungi were gathered. Grains from the parts of heads with manifested disease symptoms were separated into separate samples, together with the grains above and below the infested head part. Apart from ocular evaluation, the percentage of grain infestation by Fusarium genus fungi was determined in all three sample categories, using wet chamber method. Deoxynivalenol (DON) was determined in the samples after extraction, using acetonitrile-water (84 : 16 v/v) solution. Quantitative amount of DON was determined using liquid chromatography with DAD detector at 220 nm. The content of DON in the samples was as follows: grains with manifested disease symptoms 353, 4 ppm (μg/g), grains above the infested head part 0, 225 ppm (μg/g), grains below the infested part 0, 125 ppm (μg/g). The content of zearalenone in the samples was determined using thin layer chromatography method. This toxic agent was determined only in the samples taken from the head part in which disease symptoms were clearly manifested in the amount of 2, 1 ppm (μg/g) ...|$|R

40|$|Screenhouse {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} Kenya showed that inoculation of cabbage seedlings with Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), either alone, {{or in combination}} with Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), reduced the number and weight of marketable <b>harvested</b> <b>heads.</b> When viruses were inoculated simultaneously, 25 % of cabbage heads were non-marketable, representing 20 -fold loss compared with control. By contrast, inoculation with CaMV alone had insignificant effects on cabbage yield. This suggests that TuMV is the more detrimental of these pathogens, and its management should be a priority. Early exposure to TuMV produced cabbages that were 50 % lighter than non-infected plants, but later infection was less damaging suggesting that controlling virus infection at the seedling stage is more important. TuMV was far less damaging to kale {{than it was to}} cabbage; although high proportions of TuMV-inoculated kale plants showed symptoms (> 90 %), the marketability and quality of leaves were not significantly reduced, and no clear relationship existed between timing of infection and subsequent crop losses. Early inoculation of Swiss chard with Beet mosaic virus (BtMV) significantly impaired leaf quality (similar to 50 % reduction in marketable leaf production), but the impact of disease was greatest in plants that had been inoculated at maturity, where average leaf losses were {{two and a half times}} those recorded in virus-free plants. Disease-management of BtMV in Swiss chard is important, therefore, not only at the seedling stage, but particularly when plants are transplanted from nursery to field...|$|R
40|$|Broccoli, Brassica oleracea L. var italica, is an {{important}} vegetable crop known to be rich in vitamins and sulforaphane. However, rapid postharvest senescence in <b>harvested</b> floral <b>heads</b> reduces its value. Complex factors such as ethylene biosynthesis, temperature, and respiration {{are involved in this}} senescence process. Meanwhile, recent developments on postharvest biotechnology, as well as studies on functional genes related to postharvest senescence have provided an opportunity for conquering this problem. In this review, we will discuss the genes involved in broccoli senescence and the physical, chemical, or genetic methods to increase shelf life and reduce quality loss due to postharvest senescence.
