An exception in this respect is the Single Euro Payments Area which allows for Euro-denominated cross-border (and domestic) <b>direct</b> <b>debits</b> since November 2010.

In late 2009, TransLink scrapped monthly and weekly paper tickets, with plans to eliminate paper tickets by the end of 2010. On 4 January 2010, to encourage the use of the go card, off-peak discounts and a <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> top-up option were introduced.

25|$|Based on a 20 December 2011 memorandum, the EU {{parliament}} {{resolved the}} mandatory dates for {{the adoption of}} the IBAN on 14 February 2012. From 1 February 2014, all national systems for credit transfer and <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> must be abolished and replaced by an IBAN-based system. This will be extended to all cross-border SEPA transactions from 1 February 2016 (Article 5 Section 7). After these dates the IBAN will be sufficient to identify an account for home and foreign financial transactions in SEPA countries and banks will no longer be permitted to require that the customer supply the BIC for the beneficiary's bank.|$|E

On 16 December 2010, the European Commission published proposed regulations that will make IBAN support mandatory for domestic credit transfer by 2013 and for domestic <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> by 2014 (with a 12 and 24 months transition period respectively). Some countries have already replaced their traditional bank account scheme by IBAN.

25|$|The Euro Payments {{regulation}} {{has been}} {{the foundation for the}} decision to create a Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The European Central Bank has created the TARGET2 interbank network that unifies the technical infrastructure of the 26 central banks of the European Union (although Sweden and the UK have opted-out). SEPA is a self-regulatory initiative by the banking sector of Europe as represented in the European Payments Council (EPC). The European Union made the scheme mandatory through the Payment Services Directive published in 2007. Since January 2008, all countries must support SEPA credit transfer, and SEPA <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> must be supported since November 2009. The regulation on SEPA payments increases the charge cap (same price for domestic payments as for cross-border payments) to €50,000.|$|E
25|$|Criticism {{has been}} {{directed}} at the cost to users of the SmartRider system compared to its predecessor, the MultiRider. While the MultiRider could be bought as a 40-ride ticket for a 25% discount, a lesser 20% discount can now only be obtained by paying by <b>direct</b> <b>debit,</b> which {{can take up to}} 3 weeks to activate. A 10% discount is available for all other methods of payment. This was raised in Parliament by Liberal MP Katie Hodson-Thomas, who claimed that passengers would end up paying $324 more a year for public transport under SmartRider. In February 2006, The West Australian reported criticism by trial users who claimed that their failure to tag off, either by accidentally forgetting to do so or due to a non-working machine, resulted in a four-zone fare being charged to the SmartRider regardless of distance travelled.|$|E

40|$|The study applies two {{approaches}} for {{the estimation of}} the social costs of main payment instruments (cash, debit card and credit card transactions, credit transfers, <b>direct</b> <b>debits,</b> business-to-business <b>direct</b> <b>debits,</b> postal inpayment money orders, postal outpayment money orders for pensions) used in Hungary in 2009. The first approach {{is based on the}} current payment structure, while the second approach is based on a more modern, hypothetical payment structure involving less cash, with no use of paper-based methods. In the first approach, the social cost amounts to HUF 388 billion, i. e. 1. 49 % of the GDP, while in the second approach, such cost amounts to HUF 285 billion, i. e. 1. 09 % of the GDP. In this context, social cost means the use of all resources (time, materials and money) necessary for the execution of payments, calculated as a net value (i. e. exclusive of fees paid for payment services). Thus, HUF 103 billion could be saved in social costs if the use of payment instruments were to be modified. private cost, social cost, net private cost, unit cost, social savings, cash transactions, debit card transactions, credit card transactions, paper-based credit transfers, electronic credit transfers, <b>direct</b> <b>debits,</b> business-to-business <b>direct</b> <b>debits,</b> postal inpayment money orders, postal outpayment money orders for pensions...|$|R
25|$|The {{amount of}} the charge {{depended}} on the vehicle's engine emissions standard and fees vary from € 2 to €10 on weekdays from 7:30 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. Free access to the ZTL was granted to several types of alternative fuel vehicles and for conventional fuel vehicles compliant with the Euro3 and Euro4 or better. Residents within the restricted zone were exempted only if driving higher emission standard vehicles while owners of vehicles with older more polluting engines a discount only if they buy an annual pass that can go up to €250 depending on the vehicle's engine emission standards.

However, an issue arises when determining whether soliciting <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> during F2F street fundraising is covered by this act. The act states specifically that licences are required for collections of money, whereas <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> are not considered to be money in law: they are ‘promises of money’ at a later date.|$|R
