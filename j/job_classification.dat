25|$|Work on {{the second}} span was {{temporarily}} interrupted in July 1940 when 250 workers at Smoot Sand & Gravel walked out to protest a <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> by the federal Wage and Hour Division. The men worked on barges dredging gravel, {{and wanted to be}} classified as seamen so they could qualify for overtime and work more than the federally approved 42-hour work week. The strike began on July 9, lasted five days, and idled more than 6,500 workers (including those working on the Social Security and Railroad Retirement Board buildings) as no concrete could be delivered. The men won reclassification as seamen, a 10 percent wage increase, and pay for five days they were idle.|$|E
25|$|Guste pleased liberals {{by being}} a strong defender of affirmative action. He {{submitted}} an amicus curiae brief in the 1986-1987 case Johnson v. Transportation Agency of Santa Clara County, California {{on behalf of a}} female county employee who was promoted over an equally-qualified male employee. The plan provided that, in making promotions to positions within a traditionally segregated <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> in which women have been significantly underrepresented, the transportation agency was authorized to consider as one factor the sex of a qualified applicant. The agency said that women were represented in numbers far less than their proportion of the county labor force. Therefore, the county plan was intended to achieve a statistically measurable yearly improvement in the hiring, training, and promotion of minorities and women. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the county government that the voluntary affirmative-action plan did not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to measure the relationship between employee preference types and their respective <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> in public horticulture. Preference types were determined by the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Past and current research indicates that certain preference types I gravitate to particular jobs due to type strengths, likes and preferences. By learning about preference types, staff in public horticulture can improve employee interpersonal relations, productivity, individual understanding, and decrease conflict and stress. The MBTI was given to staff who volunteered to participate in this research from Longwood Gardens, Morris, Scott, and Tyler Arboreta. The results show that certain preference types seem to be attracted to particular <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> in public horticulture. There are preference differences between the individual <b>job</b> <b>classifications</b> which could cause miscommunication and conflict; therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the differences to be effective managers and employees...|$|R
25|$|Bieber oversaw {{a fourth}} round of {{collective}} bargaining talks in 1987. Ford {{was chosen as}} the strike target this time, and after a slight contract extension the union reached a tentative contract with the company on September 17. Bieber agreed to establish joint committees at the national and local levels to explore the use of work teams, changing inefficient work rules, and reducing the number of job classifications. In exchange, the company agreed to a 3 percent annual wage increase in the first year with lump-sum payments equal to 3 percent of wages {{in the second and third}} years, no layoffs (except through attrition), an increase in the layoff income security fund to $500 (although it was capped at that amount), pension contribution increases, improvements in health benefits, and increased profit sharing. Twenty-one days later, GM agreed to a very similar contract. GM agreed to close no more plants, institute no more layoffs (so long as sales volumes did not decrease), the same wage and lump-sum package, the same profit sharing arrangement, similar work team and <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> study committees, and establish quality improvement committees in all plants. Both contracts were easily approved by the membership.|$|E
2500|$|NFFE {{relied heavily}} on the {{provisions}} of the Lloyd-La Follette Act as the basis for its operations. [...] Much of the union's focus was on legislative action. For example, it began advocating for a formal federal <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> system and uniform rates of compensation in 1919. These efforts paid off: The same year, Congress established the Joint Congressional Committee on the Reclassification of Salaries. In 1923, NFFE won passage of the Classification Act, which established uniform, nationwide compensation levels and tied them to the duties and responsibilities of job positions.|$|E
2500|$|Duke University {{demonstrated}} {{both the}} anti-union and racist attitudes of Durham while holding {{the power of}} a large corporation. Historically, blacks were confined to non- or semi-skilled jobs. [...] While this can be partially attributed to lack of proper qualifications, [...] Duke’s Vice President in charge of Business and Finance, Charles B. Huestis, openly admitted that Duke “practice wholesale racial discrimination in its hiring policies.” [...] The salaries of these non-skilled workers reflected additional inequality, as maids and janitors, all who were black, received wages between $1.15-1.50 per hour— well below the minimum wage of $1.60. [...] Workers were also disadvantaged in other regards, as the University had no grievance procedure, policy for summer layoffs, or <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> system. Furthermore, the University ignored the seniority system in terms of job advancement and firing procedures. Suppressing workers’ voices in the formation of workplace policies, Duke encouraged unskilled employees to simply make complaints, which their superiors then ignored. [...] Thus, the poor working conditions, low wages, racism, and desire to secure more authority and control in the workplace provided sufficient fuel for Duke workers to consider forming a union.|$|E

40|$|The {{selection}} and placement of recruits into specific military <b>job</b> <b>classifications,</b> such as sonar operation, {{is an important}} concern of the Armed Forces. Presently, the Navy uses the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) to select and place submarine and surface operators. Yet, attrition among sonar trainees is high and the ASVAB has been criticized as too general a measure to differentiate or predict performance capabilities and make <b>job</b> <b>classifications.</b> Research indicates that a multidimensional assessment of physiological, cognitive, and attitu-dinal variables may best describe the characteristics found and desired in expert sonar operators. The present study assessed the cognitive and personality characteristics of experienced sonar operators, and determined how these operators compared with sonar trainees and non-sonar personnel on the same dimensions. A secondary concern was to examine for possible differences between submarine and surface sonar operators, because different ASVAB selection criteria are used with these groups...|$|R

50|$|Under {{the first}} prong of the test, the Court found that, for unskilled labor positions, a {{manifest}} imbalance could be established {{by comparing the}} percentage of women occupying positions in the particular <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> at issue with {{the percentage of women}} in the area labor market. Since there were no women employed in the <b>job</b> <b>classification</b> that included road dispatchers, women were vastly underrepresented as compared to the area labor market. Furthermore, the plan did not call for blind hiring of women to match the percentage of women in the area labor pool. Rather, the Agency had authorized the consideration of sex as one factor to be considered in addition to an applicant's qualifications.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{concept of}} Grid {{computing}} {{is becoming the}} most important research area in the high performance computing. Under this concept, the jobs scheduling in Grid computing has more complicated problems to discover a diversity of available resources, select the appropriate applications and map to suitable resources. However, the major problem is the optimal job scheduling, which Grid nodes need to allocate the appropriate resources for each job. In this paper, we combine Fuzzy C-Mean and Genetic Algorithms which are popular algorithms, the Grid {{can be used for}} scheduling. Our model presents the method of the <b>jobs</b> <b>classifications</b> based mainly on Fuzzy C-Mean algorithm and mapping the jobs to the appropriate resources based mainly on Genetic algorithm. In the experiments, we used the workload historical information and put it into our simulator. We get the better result when compared to the traditional algorithms for scheduling policies. Finally, the paper also discusses approach of the <b>jobs</b> <b>classifications</b> and the optimization engine in Grid scheduling...|$|R
