It departed at 18:22 for Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where it picked up 31 additional passengers. At 19:12 it departed for Baltimore, Maryland, where it picked up a final group of 17 passengers and departed for South Carolina at 20:30. During these flight segments, as he would later testify at the CAB hearing, the flight engineer opened the cross feed valves between the number three and four engines, since {{he had seen a}} drop in fuel pressure on the number 3 <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> after the initial takeoff from Columbia.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{weeks prior}} at Kansas Speedway, Jeff Gordon held off a last lap charge by Kevin Harvick {{to win the}} 5-hour Energy 400. The first night Cup race at Kansas Speedway was delayed about 30 minutes by rain, saw a bank of backstretch lights go out and {{featured}} two multi-car crashes. It ended with Gordon, the points leader, scoring his 89th career Sprint Cup victory.

50|$|Vapor lock was {{far more}} common in older {{gasoline}} fuel systems incorporating a low-pressure mechanical fuel pump driven by the engine, located in the engine compartment and feeding a carburetor. Such pumps were typically located higher than the fuel tank, were directly heated by the engine and fed fuel directly to the float bowl inside the carburetor. Fuel was drawn under negative <b>pressure</b> (<b>gauge</b> <b>pressure)</b> from the feed line, increasing {{the risk of a}} vapor lock developing between the tank and pump. A vapor lock being drawn into the fuel pump could disrupt the <b>fuel</b> <b>pressure</b> long enough for the float chamber in the carburetor to partially or completely drain, causing fuel starvation in the engine. Even temporary disruption of fuel supply into the float chamber is not ideal; most carburetors are designed to run at a fixed level of fuel in the float bowl and reducing the level will reduce the fuel to air mixture delivered to the engine.|$|R

40|$|The valve and the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> {{of a gas}} {{ion laser}} were {{electrically}} insulated from the laser discharge path by connecting them in series with the cathode of the laser. The laser cathode can be grounded and preferably is a cold cathode although a hot cathode may be used instead. The cold cathode was provided with a central aperture to which was connected both the <b>pressure</b> <b>gauge</b> and the gas pressure reservoir through the valve.
