5|$|The {{cane toad}} (Bufo marinus) {{is a very}} {{adaptable}} species native to South and Central America. In the 1930s, it was introduced into Puerto Rico, and later various other islands in the Pacific and Caribbean region, as a biological pest control agent. In 1935, 3000 toads were liberated in the sugar cane fields of Queensland, Australia, {{in an attempt to}} control cane beetles such as Dermolepida albohirtum, the larvae of which damage and kill the canes. Initial results <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> countries were positive, but it later became apparent that the toads upset the ecological balance in their new environments. They bred freely, competed with native frog species, ate bees and other harmless native invertebrates, had few predators in their adopted habitats, and poisoned pets, carnivorous birds, and mammals. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> countries, they are now regarded both as pests and invasive species, and scientists are looking for a biological method to control them.|$|E
5|$|The victorious Allied Powers {{divided the}} territories {{of the former}} Austro-Hungarian empire between German Austria, Hungary and several other countries. Though the {{division}} of territories was conducted through a proclaimed principle of national self-determination, populations of ethnic Germans and Hungarians remained resident <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> territories, including Czechoslovakia, Romania and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Quest was commercially {{successful}} in Japan, {{with more than}} 2 million copies sold. Its release as Dragon Warrior in North America, and other Western countries, was less favorably received. Later, Western critics noted the game's shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. Its original pseudo-Elizabethan English script has been praised <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> reviews. Fan-made ROM hacks were released with substantial changes to the game. The game's sound effects have also been orchestrated, and its music has been performed at numerous concerts. As a whole, Dragon Warrior has been credited with establishing the basic template for the Japanese console RPGs that followed.|$|E

5|$|Julian Glover was a {{well-established}} character actor {{who had previously}} appeared in Doctor Who as Richard the Lionheart in The Crusade (1965). Glover was reluctant to don the Jagaroth mask created for scenes where Scarlioni had shed his human disguise as he felt the mask would impede his performance. As a result, he is doubled by Richard Sheekey <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> scenes. Tom Chadbon was cast as Duggan {{on account of his}} resemblance to the Franco-Belgian comics hero Tintin. Peter Halliday had previously appeared in several Doctor Who serials including The Invasion and Doctor Who and the Silurians.|$|E
5|$|Limousins {{ability to}} adapt to {{different}} environments contributed greatly to the breed's current success outside France. In most cases, Limousin bulls or their semen are now imported to improve locally bred Limousins. Today, the breed is present in about 70 countries around the world, and in all latitudes ranging from Finland in the north to South Africa in the south. Limousin breeders' associations exist <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> countries, of which 29 {{are members of the}} International Limousin Council (ILC). The ILC was founded at Limoges in 1973 by Louis de Neuville, the Limousin breed ambassador. In 1989, EUROLIM was formed to bring together all of the herd books of European Limousins.|$|E
5|$|Multiple organolithium {{reagents}} {{are known}} {{in which there}} is a direct bond between carbon and lithium atoms, effectively creating a carbanion. These are extremely powerful bases and nucleophiles. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> organolithium compounds, the lithium ions tend to aggregate into high-symmetry clusters by themselves, which is relatively common for alkali cations. LiHe, a very weakly interacting van der Waals compound, has been detected at very low temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Oxidative {{stress is}} thought to {{contribute}} to the development of a wide range of diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, the pathologies caused by diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegeneration in motor neuron diseases. <b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> cases, it is unclear if oxidants trigger the disease, or if they are produced as a secondary consequence of the disease and from general tissue damage; One case in which this link is particularly well understood is the role of oxidative stress in cardiovascular disease. Here, low density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation appears to trigger the process of atherogenesis, which results in atherosclerosis, and finally cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Phosphorus, {{selenium}} and lead, {{which are}} less often recognised as metalloids, {{are also used}} in glasses. Phosphate glass has a substrate of phosphorus pentoxide (P2O5), rather than the silica (SiO2) of conventional silicate glasses. It is used, for example, to make sodium lamps. Selenium compounds can be used both as decolourising agents and to add a red colour to glass. Decorative glassware made of traditional lead glass contains at least 30% lead(II) oxide (PbO); lead glass used for radiation shielding may have up to 65% PbO. Lead-based glasses have also been extensively used in electronics components; enamelling; sealing and glazing materials; and solar cells. Bismuth based oxide glasses have emerged as a less toxic replacement for lead <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> applications.|$|E
5|$|Red maple is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like red maple, but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E

5|$|The fern {{thrives in}} thin {{serpentine}} soils on sunny, disturbed habitats such as roadcuts and talus slopes, in dunite and other ultramafic rocks. Anthropogenic disturbance has removed thicker soils and increased sun exposure <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> sites; for instance, {{many of the}} Quebec stations are in asbestos mines, both abandoned and active. In more natural habitats, frost weathering and erosion may promote rock fall and maintain suitable habitat.|$|E
5|$|People {{have lived}} in the Everglades region for {{thousands}} of years. Within the past 100years however, they have changed the natural landscape dramatically. Settlement of urban areas in South Florida was facilitated by large drainage projects intended to create more land. The drainage was often implemented without a full understanding of the intricacies of ecosystems and shaping processes of the Everglades. The South Florida metropolitan area grew exponentially, causing problems in ecosystems throughout the Everglades. By the 1990s, the diminishing quality of life <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> urban areas was linked to the degraded local environment. The State of Florida and the U.S. government devised and passed a plan in 2000 to restore as much of the Everglades to pre-drainage conditions as possible. It is the costliest and most comprehensive environmental restoration project in history.|$|E
