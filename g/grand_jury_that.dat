5|$|Despite her confession, Wise {{pleaded not}} guilty to the charge of murdering Lily Gienke in front of a grand jury on March 23, 1925. She told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> she was irresistibly {{attracted}} to attending funerals, and that when there were not enough funerals in the community, she was driven to create them by killing. Wise was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder on April 7, 1925.|$|E
5|$|The government's first witness, U.S. Attorneys' Office clerk Gordon Morgan {{testified that}} Glasser had {{suggested}} that Sidney S. Eckstone be appointed foreperson of a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> returned only eight out of twenty indictments and that Glasser and Eckstone had conferred frequently. Another prosecution witness, illegal distillery landlord William F. Workman, testified that Capone-affiliated Louis Schiavone had posted approximately $1,000,000 in bail bonds.|$|E
50|$|Three {{weeks after}} the shooting, Ann Woodward testified before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> and {{maintained}} <b>that</b> the shooting was an accident and she thought her husband was an intruder. The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> determined <b>that</b> no crime had been committed.|$|R
50|$|In two {{high-profile}} cases, <b>grand</b> <b>juries</b> {{have decided}} <b>that</b> Time magazine reporter Matthew Cooper and New York Times reporter Judith Miller must reveal their sources {{in cases involving}} CIA leaks. Time magazine exhausted its legal appeals, and Mr. Cooper eventually agreed to testify. Miller was jailed for 85 days before cooperating. U.S. District Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan ruled that the First Amendment does not insulate Time magazine reporters from a requirement to testify before a criminal <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that's</b> conducting {{the investigation into the}} possible illegal disclosure of classified information.|$|R

5|$|While the House Judiciary Committee {{hearings}} {{ended in}} a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but {{with a handful of}} Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.|$|E
5|$|On June 9, Spivey {{was arrested}} in New York, and was {{released}} pending a trial, which started in January 1953. Hirsch testified that Spivey asked to be included as a point shaver, and was upset that the payment {{for his role in}} shaving during the 1950 Sugar Bowl game was less than he anticipated. This, however, contradicted his original grand jury testimony, which had no mention of Spivey's involvement. Hirsch also told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> Spivey and West, the ringleader, had not met. West declined to testify, leading to criminal contempt charges against him. Spivey again denied taking part in the scandal, stating that he had turned down a different gambler on two occasions. According to him, ex-teammate Jim Line mentioned his name to the grand jury; Spivey said he learned this from Line. The trial lasted for 13days before the case went to a jury. By a 9â€“3 margin, the majority of jurors supported acquittal for Spivey, and the hung jury caused a mistrial. The grand jury eventually dropped the charges against Spivey.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand jury would ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E

25|$|Reynolds {{argued that}} the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> had indicted him was not legal. United States law at that time {{required}} that a grand jury consist of no fewer than 16 persons. The <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> indicted Reynolds had only 15 persons. The court rejected this argument because the Utah Territory had passed a law in 1870 under which a grand jury had to consist of only 15 persons.|$|E
25|$|On April 6, 1970, a Dukes County {{grand jury}} {{assembled}} in special session to investigate Kopechne's death. Judge Wilfred Paquet instructed {{the members of}} the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> they could consider only matters brought to their attention by the superior court, the district attorney, or their own personal knowledge. Citing the orders of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Paquet told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> it could not see the evidence or Boyle's report from the inquest, which were still impounded. Dinis, who had attended the inquest and seen Boyle's report, told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> there was not enough evidence to indict Kennedy on potential charges of manslaughter, perjury or driving to endanger. The grand jury called four witnesses who had not testified at the inquest: they testified for a total of 20 minutes, but no indictments were issued.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{criminal}} case, the government generally brings charges {{in one of}} two ways: either by accusing a suspect directly in a [...] "bill of information" [...] or other similar document, or by bringing evidence before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> to allow <b>that</b> body to determine whether the case should proceed. If the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> determines <b>that</b> there is enough evidence to justify the bringing of charges, then the defendant is indicted. In the federal system, a case must always be brought before a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> for indictment if it is punishable by death or more than one year in prison; some states, however, do not require indictment.|$|R

25|$|In {{his grand}} jury testimony, Rove testified {{he learned of}} Plame's CIA {{affiliation}} from journalists and not from government officials. Rove testified that Novak called him in July 2003 to discuss a story unrelated to Plame or Wilson. Eventually, according to Rove, Novak told him he planned to report in an upcoming column that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> by the time Novak had called him, he had already learned of Plame from other reporters, but {{that he could not}} recall which reporters had told him. When Novak inquired about Wilson's wife working for the CIA, Rove indicated he had heard something like that, according to the source's recounting of the grand jury testimony for the Associated Press. Rove told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> three days later, he had a phone conversation with Time magazine reporter Matt Cooper and, in an effort to discredit some of Wilson's allegations, informally told Cooper that he believed Wilson's wife worked for the CIA, though he never used her name. Rove also testified to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> he had heard from Libby that Plame worked for the CIA. Rove testified that Libby told him that he heard the information from journalists.|$|E

50|$|One {{young man}} was charged with the lynching after he {{publicly}} claimed credit for leading the mob, but the charges were dropped. The Santa Clara County <b>Grand</b> <b>Jury</b> met the following year, but despite literally thousands of witnesses, sources of reporters, and hundreds of photographs, the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> found <b>that</b> no witnesses could identify anyone from the lynching, so no charges were filed.|$|R
25|$|Michael Chang, {{who with}} another friend later {{attempted}} {{to find the}} gun, told the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> Markhasev told him he killed Cosby.

25|$|Senior vice {{president}} Gary Schultz and Athletic Director Tim Curley {{were found to}} be not credible by the grand jury. The two administrators were charged with grand jury perjury and failure to report suspected child abuse.

25|$|Anderson's attorney, Mark Geragos, said {{he would}} file an appeal based on his {{assertion}} that the subpoena to testify violated Anderson's plea bargain agreement in the BALCO case. Later that month, the grand jury investigating the incident retired without issuing an indictment. Anderson was immediately released and promptly subpoenaed to testify before a new <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> would take up the case. Geragos stated that his client would continue to refuse to testify.|$|E

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{criminal}} investigation, Drewniak testified on April 4, 2014, in Newark {{before the grand jury}} investigating the scandal. His lawyer, Anthony Iacullo, said he was not a target of the investigation. ABC News reported that this was the first confirmation of a convened grand jury, which can meet for up to 18 months (with further extensions possible), for interviewing witnesses. It has the power to indict, subpoena, and interview witnesses without their attorneys being present. The New York Times reported that it was the same <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> had reviewed subpoenaed documents.|$|E
25|$|The New York Court of Appeals, in People v. Goetz, {{reversed}} Judge Crane's dismissal, {{affirming the}} prosecutor's charge to the <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> a defendant's subjective {{belief that he}} is in imminent danger does not by itself justify the use of deadly force. The court agreed with the prosecutor that an objective belief, one that would be shared by a hypothetical reasonable person, is also required. The appeals court further held that Judge Crane's opinion that the testimony of Canty and Ramseur was perjurious was speculative and inappropriate. All charges were reinstated, and the case was sent to trial.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 MacFarlane warned {{a congressional}} {{committee}} of scatological behavior and animals being slaughtered in bizarre rituals that children were forced to watch. Shortly after, the United States Congress doubled its budget for child-protection programs. Psychiatrist Roland Summit delivered conferences {{in the wake of}} the McMartin trial and depicted the phenomenon as a conspiracy that involved anyone skeptical of the phenomenon. By 1986, social worker Carol Darling argued to a <b>grand</b> <b>jury</b> <b>that</b> the conspiracy reached the government. Her husband Brad Darling gave conference presentations about a Satanic conspiracy of great antiquity which he believed now permeated American communities.|$|E
