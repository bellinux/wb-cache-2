The basic case of jet flow originates from a free overfall with upstream critical flow conditions and a <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> <b>nappe.</b> In this paper, a two-dimensional potential flow {{model has been}} developed. Semiinverse mapping of the Laplace equation has been employed in conjunction with an analytical solution of the Boussinesq equations to initiate iterations for locating the free streamlines under atmospheric pressure. A systematic iteration method is proposed using the squaring technique for solving the Laplacian field, a computation of the free streamlines using the curvilinear formulation of velocity at boundary streamlines in the energy equation, and an iteration {{of the position of}} the terminal jet section versus the brink section conditions. The model permits a convergent numerical solution, which was verified against experimental data, thereby indicating that the proposed ideal fluid flow model can be applied to predict the shape of free jets by simple computations © 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.

40|$|The Penman–Monteith {{equation}} {{has been}} widely used to estimate the maximum evaporation rate (E) from wet/saturated forest canopies, regardless of canopy cover fraction. Forests are then represented as a big leaf and interception loss considered essentially as a one-dimensional process. With increasing forest sparseness the assumptions behind this big leaf approach become questionable. In sparse forests {{it might be better}} to model E and interception loss at the tree level assuming that the individual tree crowns behave as wet bulbs (‘‘wet bulb approach”). In this study, and for five different forest types and climate conditions, interception loss measurements were compared to modelled values (Gash’s interception model) based on estimates of E by the Penman–Monteith and the wet bulb approaches. Results show that the wet bulb approach is a good, and less data demanding, alternative to estimate E when the forest canopy is <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> (very sparse forests with a narrow canopy depth). When the canopy is not <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated,</b> the wet bulb approach requires a reduction of leaf area index to the upper, more ventilated parts of the canopy, needing data on the vertical leaf area distribution, which is seldom-available. In such cases, the Penman–Monteith approach seems preferable. Our data also show that canopy cover does not per se allow us to identify if a forest canopy is <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> or not.

40|$|Design of a {{high speed}} planing hull is {{analyzed}} by implementing a cambered step and stem, surface piercing hydrofoils, commonly known as a Dynaplane hull. This configuration combines the drag reduction benefits of a stepped hull with a <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> after body by using a stem stabilizer. The largest obstacle with this design is maintaining trim control and stability at high speeds. There has been limited research on the Dynaplane design since Eugene Clement first conducted tow tank tests in the David Taylor Model Basin (DTMB) in the 1960 s. Modem experimental methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) allow the designer to run multiple simulations at once while testing a variety of parametric variables. The analysis will combine theoretical, empirical, and computational methods to determine the hydrodynamic characteristics of the design and develop a new Dynaplane configuration that allows for speeds in excess of 50 knots. The design approach begins with using a reference hull named Model 5631 from a small systematic series of resistance tests at the DTMB. This modeled hull {{is based on the}} U. S. Coast Guard 47 ft Motor Lifeboat which is a hard chine, deep V planing hull. Clement's Dynaplane design process was followed with exception of the stem stabilizer recommendation. Instead, a surface piercing super cavitating (SPSC) hydrofoil designed by Dr. Stefano Brizzolara was used. These designs further improve upon the powering requirements of a conventional planing hull by effectively increasing the lift to drag ratio. A commercially available CFD software program called Star-CCM+ is used for the computational portion. The computational model is first validated using results from the Model 5631 tow tank tests. Three series of CFD tests were then conducted on the new Dynaplane design; which include developing wake geometry predictions for a swept back stepped hull, and then varying the trim angle and longitudinal center of gravity. These tests were run at an FnV= 5 in a calm sea state. Results from the analysis demonstrate the benefits of a <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> afterbody using the SPSC hydrofoils and predict the hydrodynamic behavior for the new design. Also, the results extend the range of application of Clement's Dynaplane design to hulls with 20 degree deadrise. This thesis gives naval architects design guidance for such a hullform and demonstrates the potential of CFD as a tool for analyzing these parametric variables. by Leon Alexander Faison. Thesis: S.

40|$|Introduction. Circulatory failure {{secondary}} to hypovolemia {{is a common}} situation in critical care patients. Volume replacement is the first option {{for the treatment of}} hypovolemia. A possible complication of volume loading is pulmonary edema, quantified at the bedside by the measurement of extravascular lung water index (ELWI). ELWI predicts progression to acute lung injury (ALI) in patients with risk factors for developing it. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether fluid loading guided by the stroke volume variation (SVV), in patients presumed to be hypovolemic, increased ELWI or not. Methods.

40|$|Abstract]: We {{applied a}} {{multi-purpose}} three-dimensional ocean general circulation model to compute water renewal time scales {{for a large}} coastal embayment situated off the central eastern coast of Australia (Hervey Bay) that shows features of an inverse estuary. Water renewal or ventilation time scales are not directly observable but can easily be diagnosed from numerical simulations. Improved knowledge of these time scales can assists in evaluating the water quality of coastal environments and can be utilised in sustainable marine resource management. The numerical studies are performed with the COupled Hydrodynamical Ecological model for REgioNal Shelf seas (COHERENS). The model, adopted for Hervey Bay, provided insight into ventilation pathways, and renewal time scales were found to exhibit a strong spatial variability. More than 80 % of the coastal embayment was <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> after about 70 - 100 days, with the eastern and western shallow coastal regions ventilated more rapidly than the central, deeper part of the bay. The concept of a single ’typical’ ventilation timescale characterising this particular coastal embayment is inadequate and the consideration of spatial variability is clearly important, hence in {{a second set of}} simulations local monitoring boxes and Lagrangian tracers have been used to focus on this spatial variability. Simple parameters are derived to estimate local sedimentation, transport processes or places of high/low biological production...|$|R
40|$|Deep-water {{formation}} in the northern North Atlantic Ocean and the Arctic Ocean is a key driver of the global thermohaline circulation and hence also of global climate 1. Deciphering {{the history of the}} circulation regime in the Arctic Ocean has long been prevented by the lack of data from cores of Cenozoic sediments from the Arctic 2 ̆ 7 s deep-sea floor. Similarly, the timing of the opening of a connection between the northern North Atlantic and the Arctic Ocean, permitting deep-water exchange, has been poorly constrained. This situation changed when the first drill cores were recovered from the central Arctic Ocean 2. Here we use these cores to show that the transition from poorly oxygenated to fully oxygenated (2 ̆ 7 ventilated 2 ̆ 7) conditions in the Arctic Ocean occurred during the later part of early Miocene times. We attribute this pronounced change in ventilation regime to the opening of the Fram Strait. A palaeo-geographic and palaeo-bathymetric reconstruction of the Arctic Ocean, together with a physical oceanographic analysis of the evolving strait and sill conditions in the Fram Strait, suggests that the Arctic Ocean went from an oxygen-poor 2 ̆ 7 lake stage 2 ̆ 7, to a transitional 2 ̆ 7 estuarine sea 2 ̆ 7 phase with variable ventilation, and finally to the <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> 2 ̆ 7 ocean 2 ̆ 7 phase 17. 5 Myr ago. The timing of this palaeo-oceanographic change coincides with the onset of the middle Miocene climatic optimum 3, although it remains unclear if there is a causal relationship between these two events...|$|R
40|$|The tectonic {{opening of}} Fram Strait during the Neogene was a {{significant}} geological event that transferred the Arctic Ocean from a poorly ventilated enclosed basin, with weak exchange with the North Atlantic, to a <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> &#x 201 C;ocean stage&#x 201 D;. Previous tectonic and physical oceanographic analyses suggest that the early Miocene Fram Strait was likely several times narrower and less than half as deep as the present-day 400 km wide and 2550 m deep strait. Here we use an ocean general circulation model with a passive age tracer included to further address {{the effect of the}} Fram Strait opening on the early Miocene Arctic Ocean circulation. The model tracer age exhibits strong spatial gradient between the two major Arctic Ocean deep basins: the Eurasian and Amerasian basins. There is a two-layer stratification and the exchange flow through Fram Strait shows a bi-layer structure with a low salinity outflow from the Arctic confined to a relatively thin upper layer and a saline inflow from the North Atlantic below. Our study suggests that although Fram Strait was significantly narrower and shallower during early Miocene, and the ventilation mechanism quite different in our model, the estimated ventilation rates are comparable to the chemical tracer estimates in the present-day Arctic Ocean. Since we achieved ventilation of the Arctic Ocean with a prescribed Fram Strait width of 100 km and sill depth of 1000 m, ventilation may have preceded the timing of a full ocean depth connection between the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic established through seafloor spreading and the development of the Lena Trough...|$|R

40|$|By {{processing}} {{spent fuel}} {{to remove the}} actinides, the thermal properties of the resulting high-level waste are substantially altered. In particular, the {open_quotes}thermal half-life{close_quotes} of the waste is reduced from centuries to about 30 years. This paper evaluates a High-Efficiency Waste Emplacement Concept (HEWEC) that {{takes advantage of the}} decrease in thermal half-life. The HEWEC is based on the observation that the waste loading per unit area of a repository is potentially limited by maximum allowable temperatures at several locations: the waste package (very near field), the rock surrounding the package and emplacement drifts (near field), and the large bulk of surrounding rock (far field). The first two are controlled by decay heat generated within years or decades of waste emplacement, primarily resulting from the fission products but with significant contributions from actinides. Far-field temperatures are controlled by decay heat generated over centuries, primarily from the actinides. While the critical temperature limit for spent nuclear fuel typically occurs within the package, it is close to limits in all other locations. However, if spent fuel without actinides (i. e., high-level waste) is emplaced in the repository, far-field temperatures no longer approach the limits, and waste loading is restricted by temperatures in near-field and very-near-field locations. If the repository is <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> during operation, sufficient total decay heat can be removed to allow significantly more waste to be loaded in a unit area without exceeding temperature limits. Evaluation of HEWEC is based on analysis of several existing thermomechanical studies. It appears possible to increase the equivalent amount of waste loaded in a unit area of a repository by about a factor of 4. 7 and application of the HEWEC precepts to unreprocessed spent fuel is not as effective, potentially increasing repository loading by only a factor of 1. 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{title of}} this Article purports to develop a {{normative}} framework for cross-border insolvency choice of law.

But no sooner did the universalists claim theoretical superiority than did they bow to concessions animated by such pragmatic concerns as reality, begetting the now dominant paradigm of modified universalism. One could argue this raises a nomenclature question: is 2 ̆ 2 modified universalism 2 ̆ 2 an independent normative theory for choice of insolvency law in cross-border proceedings or is it merely a pragmatic gloss put on the universalist theory, which retains the normative theoretical core? For purposes of this Article, I prefer to cast modified universalism as its own normative theory. Modified universalism is more specifically a second-order choice of law theory. It argues that the theoretical purity of universalism is desirable as a first-order matter, but because that purity is not yet attainable and because incremental advancement toward universalism is preferable to failed swings for the fences, a second-order approach is warranted. This second-order theory is mindful of pragmatic constraints and counsels that it is normatively desirable to 2 ̆ 2 modify 2 ̆ 2 universalism with some territorialist concessions. Thus, non-trivial accommodation of local law not only can but also should be tolerated in cross-border insolvency proceedings...|$|R
40|$|The Black Sea becomes {{periodically}} {{isolated from}} the global ocean during each glacial period. This occurs when the elevation of the global ocean {{is lower than the}} Bosporus sill, putting a stop to inflow of salt water to the Black Sea. This phenomenon allows the Black Sea to evolve from a marine environment to a freshwater one. It is also evident that the depth of the Bosporus sill does not remain at the same elevation, and instead is dynamic. The sill becomes filled with sediments during periods of its sub-aerial exposure but is subsequently eroded to its bedrock during periods of outflow from the Black Sea-Lake to the global ocean. This interpretation comes from the observations that during the last glacial period, the Black Sea-Lake was in a positive hydrological balance, fresh, and predominantly outflowing to the global ocean over a deep Bosporus sill, at approximately 80 meters below sea level (mbsl). It is highly likely that there were brief periods when the lake froze and the outflow suspended, such as during the extreme stadial conditions associated with the North Atlantic iceberg-discharge Heinrich Event 2 (HE 2) at ~ 24 kyr before present, when there is also no evident carbonate accumulation in stalagmites that receive water from evaporated Black Sea surface water.

PORFLOW and THERM 3 D respectively solve the two- and three-dimensional forms of the diffusion equation. In the unventilated case, the effect of radiation was approximated by defining an equivalent radiation thermal conductivity. A simple code, TEMP 3 D, based on the closed form solutions for constant and decaying heat sources, was also used. Calculations indicate that the temperature at the canister borehole wall will peak at about 215 {sup 0 }C if the drift is ventilated and about 240 {sup 0 }C if it is unventilated. The peak temperature occurs sooner in the ventilated case; after 3 to 4 yr versus 9 yr. For a point 1 m from the wall of the emplacement borehole, the corresponding peak temperatures are 150 {sup 0 }C for the ventilated case and 185 {sup 0 }C for the unventilated case and occur at about 5 and 17 yr. We assumed that the effect of drift ventilation would be to maintain a uniform temperature of 30 {sup 0 }C at the drift perimeter. If the drift is unventilated the wall rock temperature peaks some 75 to 100 yr after waste emplacement; reaching about 125 {sup 0 }C at the mid-height of the drift wall.

In contrast, when patients have diaphragmatic dysfunction, the Edi and tidal volume increase with weaning from mechanical ventilation in the same manner. However, the observed Edi would reflect high effort to achieve tidal volume.

In such cases, the Edi might be useful to assess diaphragmatic dysfunction since the Edi is expected to decrease when diaphragmatic function recovers.|$|R
40|$|With {{emerging}} {{applications for}} high speed boats in commercial, military and off shore industries, {{there is a}} focus in the naval architecture community to improve the efficiency and performance characteristics of planing hulls. In the 1960 's, Eugene Clement showed that considerable reductions in resistance at high speeds {{can be obtained by}} converting a conventional planing hull to a Dynaplane stepped planing hull. A Dynaplane stepped planing hull refers to a hull configuration where the majority of lift is provided by a swept back cambered surface, while the remainder of the lift is provided by an aft lifting surface that also provides trim control and stability. The afterbody is <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> by use of a V-shaped step positioned at the trailing edge of the cambered surface. Clement's semi-empirical conversion method was based off tests performed at the David Taylor Model Basin and is limited to boats with a deadrise of less than 15 °. Since the publication of his paper, advancements in CFD programs have made it possible to conduct accurate simulations of planing hulls with complex geometry, allowing for further development of Clement's method. This thesis expands Clement's method to high deadrise by applying it to a notional version of the Mark V Special Operations Craft used by the United States Navy with a design speed of 55 kts. CFD simulations with fixed trim were run in order to refine the cambered surface, design the step and afterbody, to position the hydrofoil and to test the low speed performance of the interceptor. Once the hull design was finalized, simulations with two degrees of freedom were run to assess the dynamic stability of the hull. Through simulations, {{it was found that the}} configuration is dynamically stable and is able to reduce hull resistance at design speed by as much as 54 % when compared with that of the original hull. by Calley Dawn Gray.

40|$|Although {{naturally}} ventilated {{buildings are}} gaining popularity, {{it is commonly}} seen that buildings are not always <b>fully</b> naturally <b>ventilated,</b> but sometimes combine both natural ventilation and mechanical cooling; these {{are referred to as}} ‘mixed mode’ (MM) buildings. The temporal and spatial method of cooling the space further classifies the mixed mode building as changeover, zoned and concurrent type (Center for the Built Environment website). Typically in office buildings in India, part of the building is AC while the rest of it is NV possibly due to programmatic requirements such as conference rooms and computer labs or due to warm indoor conditions. In such zoned mixed mode (MM) buildings, occupants move frequently between the AC and NV zone which poses an interesting question - Does the experience of comfort in the AC zone influence the comfort expectation of occupants who primarily work in the NV zone? To answer this question, the physical environmental conditions, use of adaptive actions and thermal comfort responses need to be evaluated in both the zones of the MM building...|$|R
40|$|Sediments of Lake Donggi Cona on {{the northeastern}} Tibetan Plateau were studied to infer {{changes in the}} {{lacustrine}} depositional environment, related to climatic and non-climatic changes during the last 19 kyr. The lake today fills a 30 × 8 km big and 95 m deep tectonic basin, associated with the Kunlun Fault. The study was conducted on a sediment-core transect through the lake basin, {{in order to gain}} a complete picture of spatiotemporal environmental change. The recovered sediments are partly finely laminated and are composed of calcareous muds with variable amounts of carbonate micrite, organic matter, detrital silt and clay. On the basis of sedimentological, geochemical, and mineralogical data up to five lithological units (LU) can be distinguished that document distinct stages {{in the development of the}} lake system. The onset of the lowermost LU with lacustrine muds above basal sands indicates that lake level was at least 39 m below the present level and started to rise after 19 ka, possibly in response to regional deglaciation. At this time, the lacustrine environment was characterized by detrital sediment influx and the deposition of siliciclastic sediment. In two sediment cores, upward grain-size coarsening documents a lake-level fall after 13 cal ka BP, possibly associated with the late-glacial Younger Dryas stadial. From 11. 5 to 4. 3 cal ka BP, grainsize fining in sediment cores from the profundal coring sites and the onset of lacustrine deposition at a litoral core site (2 m water depth) in a recent marginal bay of Donggi Cona document lake-level rise during the early to mid-Holocene to at least modern level. In addition, high biological productivity and pronounced precipitation of carbonate micrites are consistent with warm and moist climate conditions related to an enhanced influence of summer monsoon. At 4. 3 cal ka BP the lake system shifted from an aragonite- to a calcite-dominated system, indicating a change towards a fully open hydrological lake system. The younger clay-rich sediments are moreover non-laminated and lack any diagenetic sulphides, pointing to <b>fully</b> <b>ventilated</b> conditions, and the prevailing absence of lake stratification. This turning point in lake history could imply either a threshold response to insolation-forced climate cooling or a response to a non-climatic trigger, such as an erosional event or a tectonic pulse that induced a strong earthquake, which is difficult to decide from our data base...|$|R
40|$|Contract Nonr 710 (24), Task NR 0652 - 052 Experimental {{studies had}} {{previously}} been made at this Laboratory to determine the tandem interference effects for noncavitating hydrofoils. The results are compared with theory in this report, and good agreement is shown to exist. The experimental studies have now been extended to include <b>fully</b> submerged, <b>ventilated</b> foils of finite span. Both forced and naturally ventilated foils were employed in various configurations. The surface wave generated by the ventilated foil and the total interference effect of the forward foil on the force and cavity characteristics of the aft foil were of particular interest. The surface wave generated by the forward foil had relatively little influence on the force and cavity characteristics of the aft foil. For forced-ventilated foils, considerable change due to interference effects was observed in the cavity pressure of the aft foil. For long initial cavities on the forward and aft foil, the interference effect on the forces was relatively small, whereas for small initial cavities, the interference effect was much larger. Similar trends were observed for the naturally ventilated foils. Lateral separation of the forward foils reduced the interference effects to essentially negligible values.

40|$|Force {{measurements}} and visual observations {{were made in}} a water tunnel on <b>fully</b> wetted and <b>ventilated</b> flows past a family of conical ring wings having a flat plate section geometry. The diameter-chord ratio was varied from one to three, and the total included cone angle was 12 degrees. The fully wetted flows all exhibited separation from the leading edge except for the largest diameter-chord ratio, a result which was in agreement with previous work. The effect of ventilation is to reduce markedly the lift curve slope. Pressure distribution measurements were also made under ventilating conditions for one member of this series. The effect of ventilation over {{only a portion of}} the circumference of the ring was also briefly investigated. Large cross forces were developed by such ventilation and some comparisons are made between this method of obtaining control forces and more conventional methods...|$|R
