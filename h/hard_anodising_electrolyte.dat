40|$|High {{frequency}} anodising of Al–TiO 2 surface composites using pulse reverse {{pulse technique}} was investigated with an aim {{to understand the}} effect of the anodising parameters on the optical appearance, microstructure, hardness and growth rate of the anodic layer. Friction stir processing was employed to prepare the Al–TiO 2 surface composites, which were anodised in a 20 wt. % sulphuric acid bath at 10 °C as a function of pulse frequency, pulse duty cycle, and anodic cycle voltage amplitudes. The optical appearance of the films was characterized and quantified using an integrating sphere-spectrometer setup, which measures the total and diffuse reflectance from the surface. The change in optical reflectance spectra from the anodised layer was correlated to the applied anodising parameters and microstructure of the anodic layer aswell as the Al–TiO 2 substrate. Change in hardness of the anodised layerwas alsomeasured as a function of various anodising parameters. Anodic film growth, hardness, and total reflectance of the surface were found to be highly dependent on the anodising frequency and the anodic cycle potential. Longer exposure times to the <b>anodising</b> <b>electrolyte</b> at lower growth rates resulted in lowering of the reflectance due to TiO 2 particle degradation and low hardness due to increased dissolution of the anodised layer during the process...|$|R

Starting from a reported failure on a spacecraft, test facilities were developed and a verification study was done to show relevance between the test results and the reported failure. In the following, a standardised test method was set-up, in order to compare different space relevant materials and coatings for their tendency to cold welding. Within several studies, common experience and numerical results were gained on space relevant combinations of materials and coatings.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{adaptation}} of standard {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) integrated circuit (IC) technology for biocompatibility, enabling a low-cost solution for drug discovery pharmacology, neural interface systems, cell-based biosensors and electrophysiology. The basis for the process is the anodisation of IC aluminium electrodes to form nanoporous alumina. The porous alumina was electrochemically thinned to reduce the alumina electrode impedance. For applications where a porous electrode surface is either preferred or acceptable, we demonstrated that porosity can be manipulated at room temperature by modifying the <b>anodising</b> <b>electrolyte</b> to include up to 40 % polyethylene glycol and reducing the phosphoric acid concentration from 4 % (w/v) to 1 %. For applications requiring a planar microelectrode surface, a noble metal was electrodeposited into the pores of the alumina film. Limited success was achieved with a pH 7 platinum and pH 5 gold cyanide bath but good results were demonstrated with a pH 0. 5 gold chloride bath which produced planar biocompatible electrodes. A further reduction in impedance was produced by deposition of platinum-black, which may be a necessary additional step for demanding applications such as neuronal recording. During this work a capability for real-time electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was developed to study anodisation, barrier oxide thinning, oxide breakdown and electrodeposition processes. To study the pore morphology, focused ion beam (FIB) was employed to produce cross-sectional cuts of the IC features which were inspected by SEM with an 'In-lens' detector. The anodisation process and the optional electrodeposition steps require only simple bench equipment operated at room temperature and is therefore a viable route for manufacturing low-cost biocompatible electrodes from standard CMOS ICs...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that silicon can be locally doped with aluminium to form localised p+ surface regions by laser-doping through anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) layers formed on the silicon surface. The resulting p+ regions can extend more than 10 [*]μm into the silicon and the electrically active p-type dopant concentration exceeds 1020 [*]cm− 3 {{for the first}} 6 - 7 [*]μm of the formed p+ region. Anodic aluminium oxide layers can be doped with other impurities, such as boron and phosphorus, by <b>anodising</b> in <b>electrolytes</b> containing the extrinsic impurities in ionic form. The ions become trapped in the formed anodic oxide during anodisation, therefore enabling the impurity to be introduced into the silicon, with aluminium, during laser-doping. This codoping process {{can be used to}} create very heavily doped surface layers which can reduce contact resistance on metallisation, whilst the deeper doping achieved by the intrinsic aluminium may act to shield the surface from minority carriers. laser-doping through AAO layers can be performed without introducing any voids in the silicon or fumes which may be harmful to human health...|$|R
40|$|The {{adaptation}} of standard integrated circuit (IC) technology for biosensors in drug discovery pharmacology, neural interface systems, environmental sensors and electrophysiology requires electrodes to be electrochemically stable, biocompatible and affordable. Unfortunately, the ubiquitous IC technology, complementary {{metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS), does not meet the first of these requirements. For devices intended only for research, modification of CMOS by post-processing using cleanroom facilities has been achieved by others. However, to enable adoption of CMOS as a basis for commercial biosensors, the economies of scale of CMOS fabrication must be maintained by using only low-cost post-processing techniques. The scope of this work was to develop post-processing methods that meet the electrochemical and biocompatibility requirements but within the low-cost constraint. Several approaches were appraised with the two most promising designs taken forward for further investigation. Firstly, a process was developed whereby the corrodible aluminium is anodised to form nanoporous alumina and further processed to optimise its impedance. A second design included a noble metal in the alumina pores to enhance further the electrical characteristics of the electrode. Experiments demonstrated {{for the first time the}} ability to anodise CMOS metallisation to form the desired electrodes. Tests showed the electrode addressed the problems of corrosion and presented a surface that was biocompatible with the NG 108 - 15 neuronal cell line. Difficulties in assessing the influence of alumina porosity led to the development of a novel cell adhesion assay that showed for the first time neuronal cells adhere preferentially to large pores rather than small pores or planar aluminium. It was also demonstrated that porosity can be manipulated at room temperature by modifying the <b>anodising</b> <b>electrolyte</b> with polyethylene glycol. CMOS ICs were designed as multiple electrode arrays and optimised for neuronal recordings. This utilised the design incorporating a noble metal deposited into the porous alumina. Deposition of platinum was only partially successful, with better results using gold. This provided an electrode surface suitable for electric cell-substrate impedance sensors (ECIS) and many other sensor applications. Further processing deposited platinum black to improve signal-to-noise ratio for neuronal recordings. The developed processes require no specialised semiconductor fabrication equipment and can process CMOS ICs on laboratory or factory bench tops in less than one hour. During the course of electrode development, new methods for biosensor packaging were assessed: firstly, a biocompatible polyethylene glycol mould process was developed for improved prototype assembly. Secondly, a commercial ‘partial encapsulation’ process (Quik-Pak, U. S.) was assessed for biocompatibility. Cell vitality tests showed both methods were biocompatible and therefore suitable for use in cell-based biosensors. The post-processed CMOS electrode arrays were demonstrated by successfully recording neuronal cell electrical activity (action potentials) and by ECIS with a human epithelial cell line (Caco 2). It is evident that these developments may provide a missing link that can enable commercialisation of CMOS biosensors. Further work is being planned to demonstrate the technology in context for specific markets. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. <b>Hard</b> <b>anodising</b> on aluminium and its alloys has been widely practised {{for many years in}} order to improve the resistance of the otherwise poor wear characteristics of aluminium. In recent years there has been an increasing interest in other treatments and coatings, on both aluminium and other base metals. The aim of this investigation is to explain the tribological performance and wear mechanism(s) of an uncoated aluminium alloy, four anodic coated alloys, and also an electroless nickel alloy. All of the coatings are produced on three different aluminium alloys. The thickness of the anodic films is 30 - 35 micron, as this thickness falls within the range commonly used by industry. In an endeavour to explain the role of coating thickness on wear life, electroless nickel alloy has been produced in a range of thicknesses of 10, 20 and 30 micron. To evaluate abrasive and adhesive wear, the samples were rubbed against a single point diamond and steel ball, respectively, in a reciprocating movement at room temperature and 65 - 75 % relative humidity, under a wide range of load and sliding distance. Some tests continued to run until a breakdown of the coatings occurred, whilst other tests were interrupted at intermediate stages. This enabled the initiation and propagation of failure mechanisms to be studied. Abrasive wear was performed under dry conditions, whereas, adhesive wear was evaluated under both dry and lubricated conditions. Wear of these coatings was proportional to the applied load and sliding distance, but there was no direct relationship between wear and hardness. The tribological performance of these coatings appears to be dictated by a) the composition of the substrate, b) the chemical and physical nature of the coatings and c) the test conditions. Under boundary lubricated conditions there was a considerable increase in the wear life of the coatings. A three dimensional surface texture is superior to a machined surface, in controlling contact conditions. There is an approximate linear relationship between coating thickness and wear life for electroless nickel alloys. These coatings predominantly fail by adhesion, plastic deformation and brittle fracture. A microscopic model for fracture of brittle materials, under both static and dynamic conditions for abrasive and adhesive wear correlates very well with the behaviour of these coatings. Analytical interpretation of adhesive wear was made by separately calculating the coefficient of wear "K" of the counterbodies. This information enables an improved understanding of the wear test itself {{to be added to the}} model of the wear mechanisms involved...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to further develop the idea {{introduced}} by Muaddi et al (1981) which enables some of the disadvantages of earlier destructive adhesion test methods to be overcome. The test is non-destructive in nature but it does need to be calibrated against a destructive method. Adhesion is determined by measuring the effect of plating on internal friction. This is achieved by determining the damping of vibrations of a resonating specimen before and after plating. The level of adhesion was considered by the above authors to influence the degree of damping. In the major portion of the research work the electrodeposited metal was Watt's nickel, which is ductile in nature and is therefore suitable for peel adhesion testing. The base metals chosen were aluminium alloys S 1 C and HE 9 as it {{is relatively easy to}} produce varying levels of adhesion between the substrate and electrodeposited coating by choosing the appropriate process sequence. S 1 C alloy is the commercially pure aluminium and was used to produce good adhesion. HE 9 aluminium alloy is a more difficult to plate alloy and was chosen to produce poorer adhesion. The "Modal Testing" method used for studying vibrations was investigated as a possible means of evaluating adhesion but was not successful and so research was concentrated on the "Q" meter. The method based on the use of a "Q" meter involves the principle of exciting vibrations in a sample, interrupting the driving signal and counting the number of oscillations of the freely decaying vibrations between two known preselected amplitudes of oscillations. It was not possible to reconstruct a working instrument using Muaddi's thesis (1982) as it had either a serious error or the information was incomplete. Hence a modified "Q" meter had to be designed and constructed but it was then difficult to resonate non-magnetic materials, such as aluminium, therefore, a comparison before and after plating could not be made. A new "Q" meter was then developed based on an Impulse Technique. A regulated miniature hammer was used to excite the test piece at the fundamental mode instead of an electronic hammer and test pieces were supported at the two predetermined nodal points using nylon threads. This instrument developed was not very successful at detecting changes due to good and poor pretreatments given before plating, however, it was more sensitive to changes at the surface such as room temperature oxidation. Statistical analysis of test results from untreated aluminium alloys show that the instrument is not always consistent, the variation was even bigger when readings were taken on different days. Although aluminium is said to form protective oxides at room temperature there was evidence that the aluminium surface changes continuously due to film formation, growth and breakdown. Nickel plated and zinc alloy immersion coated samples also showed variation in Q with time. In order to prove that the variations in Q were mainly due to surface oxidation, aluminium samples were lacquered and anodised Such treatments enveloped the active surfaces reacting with the environment and the Q variation with time was almost eliminated especially after <b>hard</b> <b>anodising.</b> This instrument detected major differences between different untreated aluminium substrates. Also Q values decreased progressively as coating thicknesses were increased. This instrument was also able to detect changes in Q due to heat-treatment of aluminium alloys...|$|R

40|$|TiO 2 {{thin films}} were {{fabricated}} on titanium substrates by the anodisation method. Different anodisation parameters, such as <b>anodising</b> voltage, <b>electrolyte</b> concentration and <b>anodising</b> time, {{have been investigated}} in order to explore their effects on the photocatalytic performance of the films. Regarding the effect of anodisation voltage, GAXRD analysis showed that anatase was the only oxide phase in the samples anodised at voltages from 100 to 200 V (at 10 min for 0. 2 M oxalic acid and current density 60 mA / cm^ 2). Data from Raman showed that anatase was present in all films and its intensity increased with increasing voltage. FESEM images showed that, at anodisation voltages of 10 - 20 V, a flat layer was formed, which became rougher with increasing voltage in the range 50 - 100 V. With further increase in the voltage to 120 - 200 V, increased porosity resulted. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed an increase in film thickness with increasing anodisation voltage. The photocatalytic performance showed that the activities increased with increasing anodisation voltage and hence thickness and roughness. With regard {{to the effect of}} varying electrolyte concentration, mineralogical analysis showed that anatase was the only phase present in the films (at 10 min for 0. 2, 0. 4 and 0. 6 M oxalic acid at 120 V and current density 60 mA / cm^ 2). However, there was an increase in the intensity of the Raman anatase peaks with increasing electrolyte concentration, which was confirmed by TEM analysis, which showed that the film thickness increased with increasing electrolyte concentration. FESEM analysis showed that the areal density of the pores and cracks increased with increasing electrolyte concentration. The photocatalytic performance showed that the activities with increasing electrolyte concentration. With regard to the effect of anodising time, GAXRD and Raman analysis showed that anatase was the only phase in all the films fabricated at different anodisation times (5, 10 and 20 minfor 0. 2 M oxalic acid at 200 V and current density 60 mA / cm^ 2). Further, the data showed that anatase peaks for both types of analysis increased with increasing anodising time. FESEM analysis showed that the diameter and areal density of the pores increased with increasing anodising time formed. Correspondingly there was an increase in the photocatalytic performance with increasing anodising time for the reasons mentioned above...|$|R
