Interestingly, fearful eyes, brows and mouth seem to separately reproduce these brain responses.

500|$|The song {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In 2011, Rolling Stone {{called it the}} second greatest Gaga song of all time, praising the song's theme and beat. Jill Menze of Billboard, while reviewing The Fame Ball Tour, complimented Gaga's vocals on the song by saying, [...] "The fame-obsessed ballad 'Paparazzi' showed how adept she can be with her range." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that, [...] "You may quickly tire of hearing the album's theme constantly reiterated, but the tune of 'Paparazzi' takes up residence <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> and refuses to budge." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called the song clever and said that it [...] "functions simultaneously as glorious pop trash and a wicked parody of it." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Mine" [...] is a country-pop {{song with}} {{a length of}} three minutes and 52 seconds. KILT-FM {{described}} [...] "Mine" [...] as [...] "an uptempo song that's unmistakably Taylor" [...] with [...] "a big chorus and [...] very singable." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 explained that the song [...] "is a mishmash of ideas bolted together by a terrific power-pop chorus that will stick <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> after {{the second or third}} listen." [...] The song is set in the time signature of common time, and has a moderate tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is written in the key of G major and Swift's vocals span one octave, from G3 to D5. It follows the chord progression of C2–G5–D5–C2–D5. Alan Macpherson of The Guardian noted that the song [...] "reprises the joyous rush of Swift's breakthrough hit, [...] "Love Story", but depicts love as an adult process rather than a teenage dream." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Still Into You" [...] was {{acclaimed}} {{by music}} critics, who commended the song as fun and catchy, and praised Williams' vocals. Marc Zanotti at Music Feeds called the song [...] "a poppy, upbeat, sugary sweet number". Scott Heisel of Alternative Press {{referred to it}} one of the best songs on Paramore, saying [...] "There's no question that this is still Paramore, only it's better. The chorus hook will stay <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> for days at a time, ... and when you throw in the band's newfound embracing of electronics, you find yourself with what will ideally be one of the biggest hits of 2013." [...] Maura Johnston from Popdust gave the song a 5 out of 5, declaring [...] "If there’s any justice in the world this’ll be a song of the summer, or at least of the late spring". Joseph R. Atilano at Inquirer.net noted that [...] "“Still Into You” is really directed to their youngest fans with its happy-go-lucky lyrics that are as cheerful as they can get and somewhat disarming in their simplicity", considering it better than the previous single [...] "Now".|$|E
500|$|... "Wear My Kiss" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. BBC Music's Al Fox {{described it as}} [...] "a glimmer of brilliance" [...] amongst the album's other tracks. Alice Wyllie of The Scotsman and David Balls of Digital Spy called the song radio-friendly, while the latter described it as [...] "more comfortably more Sugababes-sounding" [...] than the group's previous two singles, [...] "Get Sexy" [...] and [...] "About a Girl". Balls praised the hook as one that [...] "lodges <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> like shrapnel". A writer from Daily Record shared a similar opinion, writing: [...] "The big chanted hook won't go away once it's in your head". Andy Gill of The Independent regarded [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] {{as one of the}} album's better tracks and noted that it practices [...] "a craven form of extreme self-objectification". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian noted that while the album was significantly Americanised, [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] had [...] "escaped with some quirky Britishness intact". Khaleej Times wrote that the song proves the Sugababes are [...] "feisty and seductive as ever" [...] and elaborated, [...] "the cut-glass industrialism of the backing track belies the dedication of the trio to the permanent touchpoints of pop music".|$|E
2500|$|Keeping up an even-handed treatment, Kingsley {{introduced}} {{as a character}} in the story Professor Ptthmllnsprts (Put-them-all-in-spirits) as an amalgam of Owen and Huxley, satirising each in turn. Like the very possessive Owen, the Professor was [...] "very good to all the world {{as long as it}} was good to him. Only one fault he had, which cock-robins have likewise, as you may see if you look out of the nursery window—that, when any one else found a curious worm, he would hop round them, and peck them, and set up his tail, and bristle up his feathers, just as a cock-robin would; and declare that he found the worm first; and that it was his worm; and, if not, that then it was not a worm at all." [...] Like Huxley, [...] "the professor had not the least notion of allowing that things were true, merely because people thought them beautiful.... The professor, indeed, went further, and held that no man was forced to believe anything to be true, but what he could see, hear, taste, or handle." [...] A paragraph on [...] "the great hippopotamus test" [...] opens with the Professor, like Huxley, declaring [...] "that apes had hippopotamus majors in their brains just as men have", but then like Owen presenting the argument that [...] "If you have a hippopotamus major <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>brain,</b> you are no ape".|$|E

That wasn't the way I started, young man; when I was sixteen, my jacket smelt of tar, and I wasn't afraid of handling cheeses.

5000|$|ScreenRelish gave a mixed {{review for}} Lemon Tree Passage, panning the film overall and stating {{that it was}} [...] "a film that wants to send shivers down your spine (and {{certainly}} the promotional artwork does that <b>in</b> spades), but <b>your</b> <b>brain</b> is too preoccupied {{trying to figure out}} what’s going on, that it ultimately proves to be a somewhat dissatisfying experience."
