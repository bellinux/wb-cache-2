The {{aim is to}} show quantitatively {{the significance of the}} opened parasitic elements that affect the {{characteristics of}} the antenna system, and hence cannot be ignored as the radius of the elements becomes thick and the interelement spacing becomes small. The effect of a parallel shorted parasitic element upon a nearby dipole antenna has been reported by A h and Warren [11. On the other hand, the case where opened parasitic elements are used has not been treated numerically so far, as the opened elements have usually been considered to affect the characteristics of the antenna system very little.

The hexagonal geometry to achieve CP is perturbed in four different ways: first with a rectangular slot at centre, second with two narrow slits at opposite vertices, third with double conducting stub at opposite vertices and fourth with a single conducting stub at a vertex. With any of these perturbing structures embedded in the hexagonal geometry and single probe feeding the antenna along the diagonal line of the square substrate of dimension 60 mm x 60 mm, the antenna radiates left hand circularly polarized waves. Four such hexagonal antenna configurations are analyzed to determine the resonant frequency, impedance BW, axial ratio, gain and radiation patterns in the E-plane and H-plane.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{electron}} acceleration by a localized electrostatic potential oscillating at high frequencies {{by means of}} particle‐in‐cell (PIC) simulations, in which we apply oscillating electric fields to two neighboring simulation cells. We derive an analytic model for the direct electron heating by the externally <b>driven</b> <b>antenna</b> electric field, and we confirm that it approximates well the electron heating obtained in the simulations. In the simulations, transient waves accelerate electrons in a sheath surrounding the antenna. This increases the Larmor radii of the electrons close to the antenna, and more electrons can reach the antenna location {{to interact with the}} externally driven fields. The resulting hot electron sheath is dense enough to support strong waves that produce high‐energy sounder‐accelerated electrons (SAEs) by their nonlinear interaction with the ambient electrons. By increasing the emission amplitudes in our simulations to values that are representative for the ones of the sounder on board the OEDIPUS C (OC) satellites, we obtain electron acceleration into the energy range which is comparable to the 20 keV energies of the SAE observed by the OC mission. The emission also triggers stable electrostatic waves oscillating at frequencies close to the first harmonic of the electron cyclotron frequency. We find this to be an encouraging first step of examining SAE generation with kinetic numerical simulation codes...|$|E

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the work {{presented}} in this licentiate thesis concerns antenna design, adaptive antenna control and investigation on how the performance of small wireless nodes can be increased by inclusion of multiple antennas. In order to provide an end-user suitable solution for wireless nodes the devices require both small form factor and good performance {{in order to be}} competitive on the marked and thus the main part of this thesis focuses on techniques developed to achieve these goals. Two prototype systems have been developed where one has been used by National Defence Research Agency (FOI) to successfully monitor a test-subject moving in an outdoor terrain. The other prototype system shows the overall performance gain achievable in a wireless sensor node when multiple antennas and antenna beam steering is used. As an example of how to include multiple antennas in a wireless node the concept of using dual conformal patch antennas for wireless nodes is presented. The proposed antenna showed an excess of 10 dB gain when using a single <b>driven</b> <b>antenna</b> element as would be the case in a system utilizing antenna selection combining. When used as a 2 -element phased array, up to 19 dB gain was obtained in a multiscattering environment. Using the second order resonance the proposed antenna structure achieves low mutual coupling and a reflection coefficient lower than - 15 dB. The presented antenna design shows how a dual antenna wireless node can be designed using discrete phase control with passive matching which provides a good adaptive antenna solution usable for wireless sensor networks. The inclusion of discrete phase sweep diversity in a wireless node has been evaluated and shown to provide a significant diversity gain. The diversity gain of a discrete phase sweep diversity based system was measured in both a reverberation chamber and a real life office environment. The former environment showed between 5. 5 to 10. 3  dB diversity gain depending on the detector architecture and the latter showed a diversity gain ranging from 1 to 5. 4  dB. Also the performance of nodes designed to be placed in a high temperature and multiscattering environment (the fan stage of a jet engine) has been evaluated. The work was carried out in order to verify that a wireless sensor network is able to operate in such a multiscattering environment. It was shown that the wireless nodes are able to operate in an emulated turbine environment based on real-life measured turbine fading data. The tested sensor network was able to transmit 32 byte packages using cyclic redundancy check at 2 Mbps at an engine speed of 13. 000 rpm. WISENETWISEJE...|$|E

The radial deposition of energy into the electrons is noticeably more peaked for current drive phasing (longer wavelength excitation) relative to that for heating phasing (shorter wavelength excitation) as is expected theoretically.
