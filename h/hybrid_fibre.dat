40|$|This article {{addresses}} the multiple effects of nano-silica and <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> on {{the properties of}} an Ultra-High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) incorporating waste bottom ash (WBA). The design of the concrete mixtures {{was based on the}} aim to achieve a densely compacted matrix, employing the modified Andreasen and Andersen particle packing model. The workability, porosity, flexural and compressive strengths of the UHPFRC are measured and analysed. The results show that due to the existence of the metallic aluminium particles in WBA, the generated hydrogen can cause some visible macro-cracks in the concrete, which could reduce the mechanical properties of the concrete. However, with a simultaneous utilization of nano-silica and <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> (steel and polypropylene fibres), the negative influence from the WBA can be effectively minimized and the flexural strength of the UHPFRC can be improved...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} is {{conducted to examine}} the effects of <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> on the performance of two-way slabs. The <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> were a cocktail of steel and macrosynthetic fibres. An experimental investigation was carried out to examine the structural behaviour of hybrid-fibre-reinforced concrete (HFRC) two-way slabs under static loading conditions. A literature review was carried out on slab-column connections made with steelfibre- reinforced concrete (SFRC). The major experimental findings of previous research were discussed and the data were collected into a databank. The review of the results revealed a large scatter in the data. Nonetheless, there was an apparent size effect in the specimens. The expressions proposed to predict the capacity of the SFRC slabs gave a significant degree of scatter when evaluated using all the test results in the database. In the current study, eight full-scale interior slab-column connections with side dimensions of 1900 mm were prepared and tested.

Hybrid fiber reinforced concrete (HFRC) is the one in which {{more than one or two}} types of fibers are used as secondary reinforcement.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we report a novel histochemical method which, by {{sequential}} pre-incubations in alkaline and acidic media, selectively differentiates muscle fibres expressing myosin heavy chain IIX, {{on the basis of}} a specific profile for myofibrillar actomyosin ATPase (mATPase) activity. The enzyme reactions were tested for specificity by means of anti-myosin heavy chain monoclonal antibodies, which were characterized on Western blots of muscle homogenates. Enzyme histochemical reactions with the traditional pH buffers were compared to those of the new method and, in conjunction with the immunoreactions, used to confirm the relationship between MyHC expression and the distinct profiles for mATPase. Immunohistochemical reactions demonstrated that the new method only differentiates those fibres expressing myosin heavy chain IIX. The method revealed a continuum in which the intermediate staining intensities corresponded to <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> expressing myosin heavy chain IIX in combination with either the IIA or IIB forms. Quantitative histochemistry and immunohistochemistry (by image analysis), used to examine the relationship between staining intensities for mATPase and amounts of myosin heavy chain IIX expression, revealed that the new method discriminates well between <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> expressing variable amounts of the IIX isoform (r 2 = 0. 93...|$|R

40|$|Effects of drug-induced {{hypothyroidism}} on myosin {{heavy chain}} (MyHC) content and fibre types of fast skeletal muscles were studied {{in a small}} marsupial, Antechinus flavipes. SDS-PAGE of MyHCs from the tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius revealed four isoforms, 2 B, 2 X, 2 A and slow, in that order of decreasing abundance. After 5 weeks treatment with methimazole, the functionally fastest 2 B MyHC significantly decreased, while 2 X, 2 A and slow MyHCs increased. Immunohistochemistry using monospecific antibodies {{to each of the}} four MyHCs revealed decreased 2 b and 2 x fibres, and increased 2 a and <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> co-expressing two or three MyHCs.

We hypothesize that hypothyroidism essentially reverses the effects of thyroid hormone on MyHC gene expression of muscle fibres during myogenesis, which differ according to the developmental origin of the fibre: it induces slow MyHC expression in 2 b fibres derived from fast primary myotubes, and shifts fast MyHC expression in fibres of secondary origin towards 2 A, but not slow, MyHC...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} energy {{absorption}} {{capacity of a}} sustainable Ultra-High Performance Fibre Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) in quasi-static mode and under high velocity projectile impact.

40|$|Cremaster muscle (CM) forms a thin {{network of}} fascicles, around the spermatic cord and testis, {{connected}} by loose areolar tissue forming the cremasteric fascia. CM has a non somitic embryologic origin, as it derives from mesenchymal differentiation of the gubernacular tip (1). Thus {{it is not}} to be considered a passive extension of internal oblique muscle. CM is composed both of striated and smooth muscle cells; it is innervated by genitofemoral nerve (2). Its striated fibres, in contrast with skeletal muscles, present with a multifocal innervation by multiple neuromuscular synapses (3). Myosin isoforms are the major determinant of the contractile and biochemical heterogeneity of skeletal muscle fibers. Non somitic muscles, such as extrinsic ocular muscles, show a distinct pattern of myosin heavy chains distribution. The aim of our study was to characterize the expression of myosin isoforms in CM fascicles; biopsy samples were obtained from cases of cryptorchidism, retractile testis and inguinal hernia, undergoing surgery. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the previously identified type 1 predominance (1) and showed a high occurrence of <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres,</b> coexpressing two or more myosin isoforms. In contrast with age-matched limb muscles, persistence of developmental/neonatal myosin heavy chains was detected, beyond the determined timecourse of physiological shifting from immature isoforms (4).

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{developed}} a method which, by combining histochemical, immunohistochemical, electrophoretic and immunoblotting analyses on a single fibre, enables a sensitive characterization of human skeletal muscle fibres dissected from freeze-dried biopsy samples. For histochemical (and immunohistochemical) analysis fibre fragments (500 microns) of individual fibres were mounted in an embedding medium to allow cryostat sections of normalized thickness to be reproducibly obtained. The specificity of the myofibrillar Ca 2 + ATPase (mATPase) staining profiles in gelatin-embedded single fibre sections was tested by immunohistochemical reactions with anti-myosin heavy chain (MyHC) monoclonal antibodies specific to human MyHC I, IIA, IIB and IIA + IIB and by gel electrophoresis. The combined methodologies demonstrated the specificity of the mATPase staining patterns which correlated to the expression of distinct MyHC isoforms. In addition the results provide evidence that many fibres co-expressed different MyHC isoforms in variable relative amounts, forming a continuum. Staining intensities for mATPase, converted into optical density values by image analysis revealed that a relationship between mATPase and MyHC expression holds for <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> even when displaying one MyHC type with overwhelming dominance. The results also revealed that three MyHC isoforms I, IIA and IIB can be co-expressed on a single muscle fibre. In such a case mATPase alone, with the current protocols, does not allow an accurate characterization of the specific MyHC-based fibre type(s). Although some <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> may have displayed a non-uniform expression of myosins along their lengths, most fibres from the IIA/B group (type) remained very stable {{with respect to the}} relative amounts of the MyHCs expressed.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of muscle fibres classified {{on the basis}} of their content of different myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms was analysed in vastus lateralis muscle biopsies of 15 young men (with an average age of 22 y) by correlating immunohistochemistry with specific anti-MHC monoclonal antibodies, myofibrillar ATPase (mATPase) histochemistry and in situ hybridisation with probes specific for MHC β-slow, MHC-IIA and MHC-IIX. The characterisation of a large number of individual fibres was compared and correlated on a fibre-to-fibre basis. The panel of monoclonal antibodies used in the study allowed classification of human skeletal muscle fibres into 5 categories according to the MHC isoform they express at the protein level, types I, I + IIA, IIAX and IIX. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> coexpressing two isoforms represented a considerable proportion of the fibre composition (about 14 %) and were clearly underestimated by mATPase histochemistry.

40|$|Background: Knowledge of the {{morphological}} and biochemical alterations {{occurring in}} skeletal muscles of obese animals is relatively limited, particularly {{with respect to}} non-limb muscles and relationship to fibre type. Objective: Sternomastoid (SM; fast-twitch), extensor digitorum longus (EDL; fast-twitch), and soleus (SOL; mixed) muscles of ob/ob mouse (18 – 22 weeks) were examined with respect to size (mass, muscle mass-to-body mass ratio, cross-sectional area (CSA)), fibre CSA, protein content, myosin heavy chain (MHC) content, MHC isoform (MHCi) composition, MHCi-based fibre type composition, and lactate dehydrogenase isoenzyme (LDHiso) composition. Results: Compared with (control) muscles from lean mice, all the three muscles from ob/ob mice were smaller in size (by 13 – 30 %), with SM and EDL being the most affected. The CSA of IIB and IIB+IID fibres (the predominant fibre types in SM and EDL muscles) was markedly smaller (by ~ 30 %) in ob/ob mice, consistent with differences in muscle size. Total protein content (normalised to muscle mass) was significantly lower in EDL (− 9. 7 %) and SOL (− 14. 1 %) muscles of ob/ob mice, but there were no differences between SM, EDL, and SOL muscles from the two animal groups with respect to MHC content (also normalised to muscle mass). Electrophoretic analyses of MHCi composition in whole muscle homogenates and single muscle fibres showed a shift towards slower MHCi content, slower MHCi containing fibres, and a greater proportion of <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> in all the three muscles of ob/ob mice, with a shift towards a more aerobic-oxidative phenotype also observed with respect to LDHiso composition. Conclusion: This study showed that SM, EDL, and SOL muscles of ob/ob mice display size reductions to an extent that seems to be largely related to fibre type composition, and a shift in fibre type composition that may result from a process of structural remodelling, as suggested by the increased proportion of <b>hybrid</b> <b>fibres</b> in muscles of ob/ob mice...|$|R
