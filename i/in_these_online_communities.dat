40|$|Ebooks {{have caused}} a {{revolution}} in how people read fiction. Ereading devices and apps now integrate interactive features which {{have led to the}} development of digital reading communities populated by millions of readers from around the world, with a resurgence of social reading practices in new forms. Two of the biggest social reading communities in existence today are hosted by Amazon’s Kindle and Wattpad. This thesis offers an analysis of how these platforms’ readers are using the interactive technology within the pages of their ebooks to participate <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>online</b> reading <b>communities.</b> Original research into popular texts on Wattpad reveals that while only a small percentage of users are actively engaging with the ebooks and other readers during the process of reading, all active and passive interactions have a significant influence on the reading experience. Thus, the infrastructure of such communities ‘rewards’ serialised books which encourage higher levels of reader interactivity with greater recognition within the community, but this reward is short-lived. The application of Genette’s paratextual theory to the interactive features of these ereading platforms reveals new processes of authorisation and readers-as-writers. New paths for the evolution of digital paratextual theory see paratexts developing from ‘thresholds’ into ‘vectors’. The statistical notations of reader interactions are now informational paratexts attached to each ebook, and <b>these</b> <b>online</b> reading <b>communities</b> may be considered paratexts themselves, operating through the new paratextual phenomenon of digital marginalia. Furthermore, the existence of these reading communities on free platforms such as Wattpad is supported by commercial paratexts found within the ebook pages. These new paratexts are iii having a significant impact on social ereading and reading communities - such as how they operate and judge the ‘value’ of ebooks - but historical precedents suggest these paratexts will be readily accepted by most readers, leading to an increase in the incidence and influence of such digital paratexts. These new interactive technologies and paratexts will potentially lead to significant changes in how fiction is read. Exactly how these technologies may develop, and how public, industrial, and academic stakeholders might take advantage of these opportunities, requires further research...|$|R

40|$|Consumers {{nowadays}} {{are able}} to exchange information and opinions without physical distance constraint through various online social media channels. These online social media channels facilitate negative electronic word-of-mouth (e-WOM) spread over the world much faster than before. Negative e-WOM communication among consumers can damage a brand and may cause a serious crisis for the company. Thus, companies need to closely monitor negative e-WOM communication in social media, {{in order to identify}} the problems, to predict the potential negative impact on the business, and to make a strategic decision on how to respond negative consumer opinions. However, the majority of online discussion communities are self-organised, consumers have much more freedom and control than in company-organised discussion channels to exchange information and opinions. The negative e-WOM communication <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> are perceived as being more trustworthy, and more likely to be adopted by a large number of consumers. Although marketers have noticed the impact of negative e-WOM on business, it has been a significant challenge to get control of negative e-WOM dissemination in these communities. Researchers have identified an influential force – online opinion leaders- who reside in these online consumers communities. These opinion leaders are recognized as the most important and influential figures affecting online consumers’ negative e-WOM adoption. Companies might be able to intervene negative e-WOM dissemination by influencing opinion leaders’ behaviour within these communities. However, the online opinion leader emergence and leadership process <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> are not well studied. It is not clear what mechanism underlies the influences of opinion leaders on negative e-WOM adoption <b>in</b> <b>these</b> <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> This study attempts to explore the dynamics of online opinion leadership establishment in negative e-WOM spreading development. Particularly, the research intends to investigate: (1) How does online opinion leadership emerge in an online community following negative WOM? (2) What types of online opinion leadership emerge based on the interactions and consumer sentiments within an online community? (3) How does the role of an online opinion leader evolve over the course of negative e-WOM dissemination? And (4) What are the theoretical and managerial implications for consumer researchers and practitioners in understanding the emergence and evolution of online opinion leadership within a negative e-WOM context? This study has employed a qualitative research method to answer the above research questions. A thematic analysis approach was applied to analyse 1, 911 online discussion posts. These posts retrieved from MacRumors online discussion forum are around the issue of the faulty of the new iPhone 6 in September 2014. The activities of opinion leaders and their roles in the online community were analysed in four different discussion phases based on the negative e-WOM development. The main contribution of this research is three-fold. First, the results illustrate a leadership role taking sequence tabulation to portray how online opinion leaders accordingly gain leading position as the discussion volume changes. Second, the finding extends theoretical understanding of the dynamic of opinion leader’s activities and their roles in a negative e-WOM context which has been missing in the past research. More specifically, the findings identified eight important roles for the establishment of opinion leadership in negative e-WOM development. Among these eight roles, the following were identified as crucial in an opinion leader successfully gaining control of the spread of negative e-WOM, and eventually eliminating it: community member, helper, opinion presenter, opinion defender, evidence provider, evidence analyst, reporter and brand guardian. Lastly, it also provides practical suggestions for companies to repair the damage of negative e-WOM in online communities and regain their consumers’ trust by utilizing the power of online opinion leader...|$|E

Peter Kollock researched motivations for contributing to <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> Kollock (1999, p. 227) outlines three motivations that do not rely on altruistic behavior {{on the part of}} the contributor: anticipated reciprocity; increased recognition; and sense of efficacy. Another motivation, in which Marc Smith mentions in his 1992 thesis Voices from the WELL: The Logic of the Virtual Commons is [...] "Communion"—a [...] "sense of community" [...] as it is referred to in social psychology. In a simple sentence we can say it is made by people for the people social psychology.|$|R

As <b>these</b> <b>online</b> <b>communities</b> exist over time, {{it is possible that}} users change {{the way in which they}} contribute to the site. Through interviews with 31 long-term members of a user-generated content community who have decreased their participation on the site, we examined the meaning that these users gave to their contribution and how their new participation patterns related to their initial motivations. We complement the reader-to-leader framework (Preece and Shneiderman: AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction, vol. 1, no. 1, pp. 13 – 32, 2009) by propounding the concept of latent user to understand decreasing content contribution and user life-cycles in <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> We showed that even though latent users decrease their content contribution, their participation becomes more selective and remained consistent with initial motivations to participate. Key words: content contribution in <b>online</b> <b>communities,</b> motivations to contribute, latent users, <b>online</b> <b>communities,</b> <b>online</b> participation, reader-to-leader framework 1...|$|R

As on the rest of the Internet, language, specifically text chat, is the essential mode of social discourse <b>in</b> <b>these</b> worlds. Despite these types of virtual social spaces becoming more and more common, few studies have been done on the linguistic practices of <b>these</b> <b>online</b> <b>communities.</b> This paper offers a descriptive analysis of the sociolinguistic practices of a group of adult World of Warcraft players, and focuses especially on how discourse strategies identified in more traditional language interactions are applied by the players in the artificial environment and linguistic medium of the game...|$|R
