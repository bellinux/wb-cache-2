5|$|Despite his bluster, Kutuzov {{knew from}} dispatches that his army {{had been too}} badly hurt to fight a {{continuing}} action the following day. He <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing: by fighting the pitched battle, he could now retreat with the Russian army still intact, lead its recovery, and force the weakened French forces to move even further from their bases of supply. The dénouement became a textbook example of what a hold logistics placed upon an army far from its center of supply. On September8, the Russian army {{moved away from the}} battlefield in twin columns to Semolino, allowing Napoleon to occupy Moscow and await for 5 weeks a Russian surrender that would never come.|$|E
500|$|National Book Award finalist Richard Yates told The New York Times in 1977 {{that reading}} Salinger's stories {{for the first}} time was a {{landmark}} experience, and that [...] "nothing quite like it has happened to me since". Yates describes Salinger as [...] "a man who used language as if it were pure energy beautifully controlled, and who <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing in every silence as well as in every word." [...] Gordon Lish's O. Henry Award-winning short story [...] "For Jeromé—With Love and Kisses" [...] (1977, collected in What I Know So Far, 1984) is a play on Salinger's [...] "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor".|$|E
500|$|Ruth {{had asked}} Yankees general manager Ed Barrow for {{permission}} to barnstorm. Barrow had no objection but warned Ruth he must obtain Landis's consent. [...] Landis biographer Spink, {{who was at the}} time the editor of The Sporting News, stated, [...] "I can say that Ruth <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing when he defied Landis in October, 1921. He was willing to back his own popularity and well-known drawing powers against the Judge." [...] Ruth, to the commissioner's irritation, did not contact Landis until October 15, one day before the first exhibition. When the two spoke by telephone, Landis ordered Ruth to attend a meeting with him; Ruth refused, stating that he had to leave for Buffalo for the first game. Landis angrily refused consent for Ruth to barnstorm, and after slamming down the receiver, is recorded as saying, [...] "Who the hell does that big ape think he is? [...] That blankety-blank! [...] If he goes on that trip it {{will be one of the}} sorriest things he has ever done." [...] By one account, Yankees co-owner Colonel Tillinghast Huston attempted to dissuade Ruth as he departed, only to be told by the ballplayer, [...] "Aw, tell the old guy to jump in a lake." ...|$|E

2500|$|Throughout his career, Ewbank {{was seen}} as a humble coach who had {{a good sense of humor}} and tried to stay out of the spotlight. He could also be harsh with his players, however. Before the 1958 {{championship}} game, he gave a speech telling his stars they needed to improve and had barely made the team. Unitas, he said, was obtained [...] "with a seventy-five-cent phone call" [...] and Ameche wasn't liked or wanted. Ewbank was not universally liked by his players. Second-string running back Jack Call later said the team won [...] "in spite of, not because of" [...] Ewbank. Other players saw him as overly easygoing, saying that while he was able to build teams up, he became too relaxed once he reached the top. [...] Hall of Famer Raymond Berry stated in his book All the Moves I Had [...] "What it amounts to is that Ewbank <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted his team to do and how to get them to do it well.. [...] Being under Weeb's system was the number one reason why Unitas and I had the careers we had." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ward {{said that}} {{although}} Burton is a talented actress and {{has done a great}} job with the character, she did not feel she had to get to know her in order to proceed with the drawings. [...] "It was the character I was drawing for and I learned what I needed to from the show and the scripts," [...] she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. [...] "Schwahn always <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches," [...] stated Ward. All of their communication was via e-mail. [...] "I wish I could say something more exciting, like [...] and I would chat about what Peyton would be drawing," [...] stated Ward, [...] "but the only time I ever spoke with her was when they were filming at my house in Wilmington (which oddly enough was Peyton’s house on the show.)" [...] Despite this, Ward said she did not mention to Burton that she was the artist behind Peyton's artwork.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, he was {{involved}} in shows for the BBC and Thames Television (as well as Frankie Howerd Reveals All for Yorkshire Television in 1980). Ray Galton and Alan Simpson wrote for him from 1964 to 1966 when he worked for the BBC and also for a one-off show for Thames, Frankie Howerd meets the Bee Gees, shown on 20 August 1968. He was famous for his seemingly off-the-cuff remarks to the audience, especially in the show Up Pompeii!, which was a direct follow-up from Forum. His television work was characterised by direct addresses to camera and by his littering monologues with verbal tics such as [...] "Oooh, no missus" [...] and [...] "Titter ye not". A later sale of his scripts, however, showed that the seemingly off-the-cuff remarks had all been meticulously planned. Barry Cryer said of his technique: [...] "What he could do with a script was amazing, like all the great performers. He transformed something you'd just written – what you hoped was in a Frankie Howerd idiom – but when you heard him do it, my God, it was something else; – it was gossiping over the garden wall, the apparent waffle – he was like a tightrope walker, you thought he's going to fall off in a minute, you thought , 'Come on, Frank' , we're waiting for a laugh, and then, suddenly, Bang. He <b>knew</b> <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> was doing." [...] Another feature of his humour was to feign innocence about his obvious and [...] double entendres, while mockingly censuring the audience for finding them funny.|$|E
