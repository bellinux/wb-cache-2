5|$|After {{the player}} {{successfully}} obtains {{the assistance of}} each of the primary factions, a Landsmeet is called among the nobles of Ferelden. There, the player confronts Loghain, ultimately either executing him or sparing and initiating him into the Grey Wardens (causing Alistair to resign). The player also settles who will lead Ferelden against the Blight (Alistair and/or Anora) and rallies the rest of the kingdom against the Darkspawn. At this point, the player learns that due to the Taint, only a Grey Warden can slay the Archdemon. Killing it will release a demonic essence within it, which is <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Taint in the Grey Warden and effectively kills them; if anyone else slays it, the essence will survive and find a new host in the nearest Darkspawn, making the monster effectively immortal.|$|E

Yennie was able to further develop her relationship with Williams when the pair shared an apartment in the Netherlands during filming.

Yennie was <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> role by the humanity throughout the story, referring to how the three victims of Heiter are unwillingly forced into their situation.

5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> challenge of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
