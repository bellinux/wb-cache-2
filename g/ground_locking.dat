5000|$|During {{the course}} of the war the Oval was used by the military. Originally {{prepared}} as a prisoner of war camp, the ground never saw this use fulfilled. Instead it was used for anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, searchlights and an Army assault course. These had all destroyed the outfield, littering it with barbed wire, pits, cement posts and over 900 wooden posts. [...] Lock started the daunting task of repairing the ground in October 1945, in order to prepare it for the start of the 1946 season in April. Clearing the <b>ground,</b> <b>Lock</b> and his small staff levelled the playing field, resoiled it and finally laid some 45,000 turfs, working from dawn till dusk.

40|$|Throughout 1882 and 1883 hopes {{remained}} {{high for}} developing a successful goldfield, with some encouraging ore being found and experts praising the reefs. Investors {{were interested in the}} field, which officials expected to succeed. Competition for ground continued, with some attempts to jump claims. Tracks were required to access the mines and to take out parcels for testing, but construction of these was slow, and parts of the upper road were too steep for pack horses and required almost constant repairs. As some men shepherded their claims for speculative purposes, the warden required claims to be worked. Although neither officials not miners wanted <b>ground</b> <b>locked</b> up and not worked, intensive development was not possible until the tramway and a battery were constructed. Share trading continued, and by April 1883 17 companies had been formed, often before their claims were adequately prospected. As the battery was readied, more miners returned, with high expectations for the results of the first crushing...|$|R
25|$|One {{possible}} scenario on how direct insemination {{evolved in}} insects {{is seen in}} scorpions. The male deposits a spermatophore on the <b>ground,</b> <b>locks</b> its claws with the female's claws and then guides her over his packet of sperm, making sure it comes in contact with her genital opening. When the early (male) insects laid their spermatophores on the ground, {{it seems likely that}} some of them used the clasping organs {{at the end of their}} body to drag the female over the package. The ancestors of Odonata evolved the habit of grabbing the female behind her head, as they still do today. This action, rather than not grasping the female at all, would have increased the male's chances of spreading its genes. The chances would be further increased if they first attached their spermatophore safely on their own abdomen before they placed their abdominal claspers behind the female's head; the male would then not let the female go before her abdomen had made direct contact with his sperm storage, allowing the transfer of all sperm.|$|R

To lock the bicycle, one locks it physically to some other object, such as a bike rack, parking meter or other pole installed securely in the solid <b>ground.</b> Merely <b>locking</b> the bike frame to the wheel is not recommended because, although it cannot be rolled away, the entire bicycle can still be lifted and carried away.|$|R
50|$|The first {{proposed}} location for a pound lock in 1811 {{was across the}} bend at the present recreation <b>ground.</b> The <b>lock</b> was built at its present site {{in the winter of}} 1817-1818. It was known as Egham Lock, but took its name from Charlie Bell, the first weir keeper and ferryman. The weir collapsed under weight of ice in 1827 and the lock collapsed in 1866. Lock and weir were rebuilt in 1867 but the lock had to be rebuilt in stone in 1877. A new weir was completed in 1904.|$|R

Restarted the fight, Schilt reversed a takedown and got his own mount, but Funaki recovered guard and applied a toehold, forcing the karateka to spend another point.

40|$|At {{the end of}} the 1940 s, the anticommunist armed {{resistance}} restarted in Bukovina in {{the context}} of the more and more constant offensive of the communist regime, meant to obtain control not only over the State but also over the whole society. Some of the individuals the new authorities intended to arrest managed to escape and took refuge in the mountains and the woods, where they formed anticommunist resistance armed groups; but there were also locals who formed subversive groups without having previous conflicts with the regime. Besides the big resistance groups, there also existed several “minor” groups, who also attracted the authorities’ attention, even if at a lower level than the former ones. Among these small groups there were the ones led by Dragoş Flocea, Andrei Ghivnici, Silvestru Harsmei, the so-called “Blănaru bands” (chiefly a Securitate fabrication, it seems), „Cetatea lui Ştefan” (Stephen the Great’s Citadel) organization and “Grupul tinerilor partizani” (Young Partisans’ Group) or “Eliberarea braţelor de fier” (Iron Arms’ Liberation). The activity of these groups was to make anticommunist propaganda, to attack certain officials of the State administration (including border patrols) or of the Party. Some of the locals who joined clandestinity did not group up (or did it for only short periods), preferring to remain isolated, but unarmed, fugitives, which allowed them to hide more easily, being sheltered and fed by relatives or friends. The most important one was Gheorghe Munteanu, who survived in clandestinity since 1949 to 1961, being thus one of the most longevous anticommunist fighters. After him, resistance in Bukovina stopped being a reality on the <b>ground,</b> <b>locked</b> up, for decades, in the archives or in the survivors’ memory...|$|R
