5|$|Veronica waits with Keith at an {{election}} party, where tensions are high {{due to the}} election being extremely close. Sheriff Lamb (Michael Muhney) is nosing ahead before a man walks up to Lamb and says that he made the anonymous call from the bridge where Felix Toombs was stabbed. Keith loses the election {{by a margin of}} 51% to 49%. After we learn that Woody Goodman (Steve Guttenberg) has been elected mayor, Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) hits on Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Officers come in and arrest Logan for the murder of Felix Toombs before Veronica goes home and finds Abel Koontz, who is in the latter stages of stomach cancer. He asks her to help him find his daughter, Amelia, who has disappeared, and Veronica agrees. Veronica talks to Amelia's old boyfriend, who has not seen her for a while; Amelia ditched the boyfriend in Europe. Cliff McCormack (Daran Norris) is appointed to be Logan's lawyer before Veronica asks Cliff to call the numbers on the phone cards that Amelia stole under an alias. Cliff tells Logan that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> a different lawyer. Veronica finds out that Amelia called from Neptune (Veronica's town) the previous week. Logan is placed in a cell with his father, Aaron (Harry Hamlin), who is temporarily being held there before his trial for the murder of Lilly Kane. Logan receives bail, but Weevil and his friends are angry about this fact. Veronica breaks into Clarence Wiedman's (Christopher B. Duncan) office, but he denies any knowledge of the situation.|$|E
25|$|Shakuni also advises Duryodhana to seek Krishna's help. Duryodhana {{rushes to}} Dwarka {{only to find}} Krishna sleeping; he waits {{at the head of}} Krishna's bed when suddenly, Arjuna arrives with the same goal in mind. Arjuna waits at the foot of Krishna's bed. When Krishna wakes up, both Duryodhana and Arjuna appeal for his alliance. Krishna offers a choice of himself, {{completely}} unarmed, or the entire Vrishini army. Duryodhana proclaims that because he arrived first, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> first-pick. However, Krishna says that because he saw Arjuna first, and because Arjuna is younger, that Arjuna gets the first choice. Duryodhana becomes worried, but is overjoyed when Arjuna elects to reject Krishna's army in favor of Krishna alone. Joyously, Duryodhana returns to Hastinapur with the Vrishini army in-hand, only to be rebuked by Shakuni, who comments that Krishna is worth many armies by him.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{was born}} on Scotland Road in Liverpool. His parents were working class; his mother, Mary Jane (n√©e Fleming), a cleaner, was a devout Catholic, and his father, John Stewart Baker, was a seaman. Baker {{attended}} Cheswardine Boarding School. At 15 he became a novice monk with the Roman Catholic Brothers of Ploermel in Jersey and later in Shropshire, but left the monastery six years later after losing his faith. As {{he wrote in his}} autobiography he realised he wanted to break each of the Ten Commandments in order and thought <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> out before he did something serious. He did his national service in the Royal Army Medical Corps, serving from 1955 until 1957. At the same time, he took up acting, studying at the Rose Bruford College of Speech and Drama, Sidcup in 1956 where he met his first wife. He {{went on to become a}} professional actor in the late 1960s after the marriage broke down.|$|E

25|$|From {{that time}} he dropped his first name and was always known as Stacy Waddy. After acting {{for a short period}} as curate to Bishop Stretch at Newcastle, New South Wales, he was given the {{difficult}} parish of Stockton, New South Wales {{on the other side of}} the harbour, then much overloaded with debt. Waddy tackled his task with enthusiasm, wrote his first book, a short one on confirmation, Come for Strength, published in London in 1904, and by the middle of the same year had succeeded in paying off the parish debts. His energy was boundless, as in this year he wrote various tracts, gave over 40 lantern lecture averaged over six services a Sunday in his own parish, travelling about 30 miles on his bicycle, became bishop's chaplain and secretary of the clerical society, and also managed to fit in some very successful cricket. In December 1903 at West Maitland against Plum Warner's English eleven which included such well-known bowlers as Hurst, Len Braund, Ted Arnold, Bernard Bosanquet and Fielder, he made 93 and 102. Had he accepted the suggestion that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> a position in Sydney and play cricket, it is likely that he would have gained a place in the New South Wales eleven.|$|E
25|$|At the Royal Rumble, AJ Styles {{lost the}} WWE Championship to John Cena. Styles was {{immediately}} {{entered into the}} WWE Championship Elimination Chamber match at the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, but SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon also promised Styles {{that he would get}} a one-on-one rematch for the title if he did not win the title back at the pay-per-view. At Elimination Chamber, Bray Wyatt eliminated both Cena and Styles to win the championship. Cena then immediately invoked his rematch clause, but Styles intervened, stating <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> his first. SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan then scheduled a triple threat match for the WWE Championship, where Wyatt retained. Randy Orton then refused his right as the Royal Rumble winner to face Wyatt for the title at WrestleMania 33, so Bryan scheduled a 10-man battle royal to determine a new number one-contender. Styles was entered into the battle royal, which ended in a draw between him and Luke Harper. The two faced each other in a number one contender's match the following week. Styles pinned Harper, but the referee did not see Harper's foot on the rope. Shane came out and restarted the match, which angered Styles, even though he would defeat Harper once again. At the conclusion of the show, Orton reclaimed his right to face Wyatt at WrestleMania. Bryan and Shane decided that Styles would have to compete in another number one contender's match, this time against Orton, who won. After the show, an angered Styles got into a heated argument backstage with Shane. The following week, an irate Styles said that he was tired of Bryan and Shane. He said because of them, {{he did not have a}} match at WrestleMania, but Orton, who committed arson, did. Later backstage, Styles attacked Shane and threw him through a car window. Styles was subsequently (kayfabe) fired by Bryan, but at the end of the show, an injured Shane challenged Styles to a match at WrestleMania, which Styles accepted. At the end of the following week's episode, Shane called out Styles and the two brawled, which ended with Shane performing a Leap of Faith on Styles through the broadcast table. The following week, the two had a contract signing to make the match official and the two traded barbs.|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the arrest, Hendrix told Lawrence: [...] "Whatever I have done... getting hooked on heroin {{is not one of}} them." [...] He {{explained}} that his fear of needles discouraged him from using the drug and that having known junkies convinced him that it was not something <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> involved with. Soon after the story of his arrest became public, he drew a connection between the bust and anti-establishment sentiments: [...] "All of that is the establishment fighting back... Eventually, they will swallow themselves up, but I don't want them to swallow up too many kids as they go along." ...|$|E

His {{participation}} in the nine-day mission was criticized by some members of the space community as a favor granted by Clinton; John Pike, director of the Federation of American Scientists' space-policy project, said: [...] "If he was a normal person, he would acknowledge he's a great American hero and that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> to fly on the shuttle for free...

[...] All of Andy's {{ideas are}} well-meaning but dumb, {{although}} it seems that April is just happy to talk with him. To thank Andy, she gets him a Reggie Wayne jersey for Christmas. Meanwhile, Mark (Paul Schneider) tells Tom (Aziz Ansari) {{that he intends to}} get Ann a new computer bag for Christmas, but Tom tells him that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> diamonds. In the end, he gives her the computer bag after all while Ann gives him Pacers tickets. He then gives her a second gift, telling her she does not {{have to go to the}} game, to which Ann happily accepts.|$|E
500|$|The {{sinking of}} the RMS Lusitania in 1915 created a wave of anti-German sentiment, and Gruban worried that he would find it {{difficult}} to find government work because of his nationality and thick German accent. He again contacted Booth, who again claimed to be friends with David Lloyd George and his secretary, Christopher Addison, and said that if Gruban put Booth on the Board of Directors he could [...] "do with the Ministry of Munitions what I like". Gruban immediately made Booth the chairman of his company, and over 3 months took ¬£400 on expenses. He then claimed that this was not enough money for the work he did, and <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> a secret payment of 10% of the value of a contract known as the [...] "Birmingham Contract". The contract was worth ¬£6,000, and Booth wrote a memo saying that he should have ¬£580 or ¬£600. Gruban refused, and Booth threw the note in the wastepaper basket. From that point onwards Booth worked {{as hard as he could}} to undermine Gruban's position, while outwardly appearing to be his friend.|$|E

500|$|In 1982, Madonna, aged 24, {{was living}} in New York, and {{trying to set up}} her music career. She was joined by her Detroit boyfriend Steve Bray who became the drummer of her band, the Breakfast Club, which played {{generally}} hard-rock music. Soon they abandoned playing songs in the hard-rock genre, and got signed by a music management company called Gotham Records, planning to move in a new musical direction. They decided to pursue the funk genre, but the record company was not happy with their musical talents and they were dropped from the label; Madonna and Bray left the band also. Meanwhile, she had written and developed some songs on her own. She carried rough tapes of three of the songs, [...] "Everybody", [...] "Ain't No Big Deal" [...] and [...] "Burning Up". At that time she was frequenting the Danceteria nightclub in New York. It was here that Madonna convinced the DJ Mark Kamins to play [...] "Everybody". The song was received positively by the crowd, and Kamins decided that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> Madonna a record deal, on the understanding that he would get to produce the single. He took her to his boss Chris Blackwell, who owned Island Records, but Blackwell refused to sign Madonna so they approached Sire Records. Michael Rosenblatt, who worked in the artists and repertoire department of Sire, offered Madonna $5,000 in advance, plus $10,000 in royalties, for each song she wrote.|$|E

Vivien approaches a confused Nora who mistakes her for a nanny and demands she be called Mrs. Montgomery. Vivien complies and Nora confesses the baby took one breath before dying, thus keeping the baby's ghost in the house. Nora recognizes Vivien and insults her for having a baby that won't stop crying to which Vivien defends the baby. Vivien asks for permission to hold him, to which Nora angrily refuses and proclaims the baby as hers as arrangements were made with which Vivien regretfully complies. Vivien offers help in calming her still crying son to which Nora finally agrees. Vivien calms her child almost immediately, Nora confesses she does not have the constitution to be a caring mother and she wanted to hurt the baby and leaves the baby to Vivien to get a [...] "good rest". Finally free of anyone trying to claim her child, [...] Vivien asks Moira to join their family as the baby's godmother, which she happily accepts. Vivien names their baby Jeffrey.

2500|$|Anderson and New Line {{reportedly}} had intense {{arguments about}} how to market Magnolia. He felt that the studio did not do a decent enough job on Boogie Nights and {{did not like the}} studio's poster or trailer for Magnolia. Anderson ended up designing his own poster, cut together a trailer himself, wrote the liner notes for the soundtrack album, and pushed to avoid hyping Cruise's presence in the film in favor of the ensemble cast. Even though Anderson ultimately got his way, he realized that he had to [...] "learn to fight without being a jerk. I {{was a bit of a}} baby. At the first moment of conflict, I behaved in a slightly adolescent knee-jerk way. I just screamed." [...] In a Rolling Stone article, published around the time of Magnolias release, Anderson said that he walked out of Fight Club after the first half hour and criticized its director, David Fincher, for making jokes about cancer, saying that <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> it as punishment.

Eden's description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor {{before the start of the}} race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler self-steering gear to come loose.

2500|$|The maquis {{bands that}} emerged in the {{countryside}} soon formed a sub-culture with its own slang, way of dressing and rules. The most important maquis rule was the so-called [...] "24 hour rule", under which a captured maquisard had to hold out under torture for 24 hours before giving up information to his captors in order to give time for his comrades to escape. An underground pamphlet written for young men considering joining the maquis advised: [...] "Men who come to the Maquis to fight live badly, in precarious fashion, with food hard to find. They will be absolutely cut off from their families for the duration; the enemy does not apply the rules of war to them; they cannot be assured any pay; every effort will be made to help their families, but it is impossible to give any guarantee in this manner; all correspondence is forbidden.Bring two shirts, two pairs of underpants, two pairs of woollen socks; a light sweater, a scarf, a heavy sweater, a woollen blanket, an extra a pair of shoes, shoelaces, needles, thread, buttons, safety pins, soap, a canteen, a knife and fork, a torch, a compass, a weapon if possible, and also a sleeping bag if possible. Wear a warm suit, a beret, a raincoat, a good pair of hobnailed boots". Another pamphlet written for the maquis advised: [...] "A maquisard should stay only where he can see without being seen. He should never live, eat, sleep except surrounded by look-outs. It should never be possible to take him by surprise.A maquisard should be mobile. When a census or enlistment [...] brings new elements he has no means of knowing into his group, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> out. When one of the members deserts, <b>he</b> <b>should</b> <b>get</b> out immediately. The man could be a traitor.R√©fractaires, it is not your duty to die uselessly". One maquisard recalled his first night out in the wildness: [...] "Darkness falls in the forest. On one path, some distance from the our camp, two boys stand guard over the safety of their comrades. One has a pistol, the other a service rifle, with a few spare cartridges in a box. Their watch lasts for two hours. How amazing those hours on duty in the forest at night are! Noises come from everywhere and the pale light of the moon gives everything a queer aspect. The boy looks at a small tree and think he see it move. A lorry passes on a distant road; could it be the Germans? [...] [...] [...] Are they going to stop?" [...] Oubsy stated that the [...] "breathless prose" [...] in which this maqusiard remembered his first night out in the forest was very typical of the maqusiards whose main traits were their innocence and naivety as many seemed not to understand just precisely who they were taking on or what they were getting themselves into by fleeing to the countryside.|$|E
