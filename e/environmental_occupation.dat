40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to realize the {{characterization}} and the use/occupation of the estuary and around the Pirangi River. The area is located in the east cost of Ceará State, with 678, 21 Km 2. It was carried out the study of the environmental problems related to the occupation and land use in order to evaluate the ecosystem degradation because of the anthropics activities expansion. The methodology is according to the integrated analysis of the natural environment, following the geosistemic model. To obtain the geocoded information it was used the remote sensing and GIS technologies. Though the digital processing, using the satellite image Landsat, itwas been the identification of the use and occupation of the area. The study showed the ecosystem fragility and the risk related to <b>environmental</b> <b>occupation</b> and use capability. The conclusion of this research is that the anthropic activities and the exploration actual models of the natural resources are the more responsible to the estuary degradation and that the more significant impacts occur in the dunes and mangroves.

We submitted the corporal variables to the Multivariate Allometry and the relation between these variables was evaluated using the Principal Components Analysis. We verified the isometric growth and correlation between the different variables, evaluated the growth according to the body mass and established the proportionality ratio between the corporal regions. Each corporal region evaluated presented a fixed proportionality ratio, regardless of the stage, and the size of this portion was found when its proportionality index was multiplied by the tadpole's total length. This study demonstrates that the larval phase of R. icterica presents an isometric growth with proportional development of the corporal parts regardless of the evaluated stage...|$|E

30|$|Facial {{aging is}} {{affected}} by several factors ranging from lifestyle, natural, <b>occupation,</b> psychological, and <b>environmental.</b> Factors affecting facial aging can be categorized as both intrinsic and extrinsic. Extrinsic factors {{are those that are}} external to the human body like <b>environmental</b> and <b>occupation</b> factors while intrinsic are internal factors like bone structure and genetic influence which occur naturally over time [1, 33]. In childhood, facial changes are mainly caused by craniofacial development which lead to changes in facial shape [16] due to growth, modeling, and deposition of bony tissues in the face. This leads to changes in height and shape of the face [34]. The forehead slopes back releasing space on the cranium. Drifting and expansion of facial landmarks to occupy this space causes variations in facial shape in childhood. In adulthood, facial aging is mainly manifested in texture variations which are caused by a wide variety of factors.|$|R
40|$|Policy, environmental, {{social and}} {{economic}} factors are all driving South Africa's transition to sustainable development and a greener economy. Various policies {{have been developed to}} foster sustainable development in the post-apartheid era in South Africa (i. e. since 1994) and there are various projections on potential job creation for a green economy. However, there is a problem related to both the achievement of sustainable development and green economy objectives: South Africa is said to lack adequately qualified people to implement these goals resulting in what is termed 'scarce skills' in the environmental and sustainable development sector. This problem has, in turn, prompted various skills development studies in the environmental sector, including a national Environmental Sector Skills Plan produced in 2010. All these studies point to a reactive skills development system that provides inadequate learning pathways for existing and newly emerging green occupations, which provided the impetus for a more proactive, transformative praxis oriented system of skills development that supports environmental learning pathways in South Africa. A second problem is that the concept of 'learning pathway' is poorly defined in the South African environmental education and wider education and training policy context. This term is often used in policy discourse within the notion of 'seamless learning pathways' and is only vaguely defined. This study set out to investigate selected occupationally directed environmental learning pathways in the South African National Qualifications Framework (NQF) and green transitioning context. In attempting to characterise the nature of the environmental pathway, the study utilised critical realist metatheory which serves as an underlabourer for domain specific theory of transitioning societies and systems, life-course transitions and career development. This theoretical work allowed the characterisation of environmental learning pathways as educational and occupational progression. The study investigated the nature of learning and work transitions across the life- course of selected environmental professionals in two key occupational categories - environmental engineer and environmental scientist - both of which have been defined as scarce skills in South Africa. This enabled a nuanced examination of the formation of what emerged as 'boundaryless' career stories of professionals engaged in these two occupations. The study also sought to engage with a methodological problem in learning pathways research, notably that studies are generally framed either at the micro level career story, emphasising agency of individuals (voluntarism), or at the policy level, emphasising structural aspects of the skills development system (determinism). This study sought to bridge the macro-micro problem drawing on critical realist retroductive analysis; this facilitated the shift from a focus on events and experiences that can be empirically observed (captured in case study approaches) to the causal mechanisms influencing environmental learning pathways in these two scarce skill occupations (discussed and analysed using dialectical critical realism), shedding light on how systemic and structural dynamics and mechanisms shape and influence the emergence of learning pathways as experienced in scarce skill <b>occupations</b> in the <b>environmental</b> sector. The opening chapters of the thesis provide an historical view of how the South African education and training system, itself in a transitioning process, has had to grapple with how to respond to and meaningfully take up the new emerging environmental / sustainable development mandate, which is increasingly framed within a multi-levelled transitioning social-ecological system perspective in post-apartheid South Africa. These transitioning systems are shaped by substantive policy imperatives for societal transformation, social justice, sustainable development and equity. Since 1994, various transformations have been taking place, often in paradoxical forms, in both the environmental and educational sectors, shaping a complex multi-levelled transitioning systems perspective for the study. This background work on transitioning systems provides the foundation for the first data chapter, which provides a descriptive outline of key supply side systemic elements as these pertain to environmental learning pathways more broadly (qualifications; occupational framing; career systems; sector skills planning). It also points to the lack of adequate mechanisms for analysing demand for <b>environmental</b> <b>occupations,</b> and highlights some of the contradictions in the supply- demand relation as these pertain to newly emerging <b>environmental</b> <b>occupations.</b> This helps to explain the empirical findings of previous environmental sector studies on the slow and reactive defining of environmental education and training for <b>environmental</b> <b>occupations</b> within the transforming education and training system in South Africa. The next two chapters, using case-based qualitative data, present the analysis of the two scarce skill <b>occupations</b> investigated - <b>environmental</b> engineer and environmental scientist. These chapters outline the dominant institutional educational pathway and the key supply platforms that support these pathways (career guidance; qualifications, occupational framings, skills planning) and the learning and work transitions of professionals within the occupation. The chapters highlight the factors and causal mechanisms influencing these learning pathways and thus provide insight into the multi-level dynamics that underpin learning pathways. The final chapter uses dialectical critical realism to outline generative mechanisms influencing the construction of the learning pathways. It also highlights key absences that are shaping the emergence (or not) of environmental learning pathways, thus pointing to opportunities for how the NQF might respond to the two scarce skill occupations under study, and to the emergence of environmental learning pathways more broadly within the framework of society-in-transition. Through this, the study links the career stories as analysed within the framework of learning pathways and skills system transitioning literature, to generative mechanisms and system development elements. The study concludes with providing occupational and systemic insights into absences and disjunctures that characterise the emergence (or not) of occupationally oriented environmental learning pathways. It also provides insight into what leads to these absences, and how they are kept in place and suggests possibilities and openings for transformative praxis within a multi-levelled transitioning system framework. The study makes the following contributions: At a theoretical level, the study has shown that environmental learning pathways need to be viewed as a complex phenomenon that is emergent in open systems and constituted by dialectically interdependent planes. A deeper understanding of environmental learning pathways is driven by both educational and occupational progression. It utilises key contemporary ideas around learning and work transitions but links them to the broader analyses of transitioning societies influencing the environmental sector, indicating the significance of how environmental education and training system development is situated within the wider transitioning process oriented towards social-ecological sustainability, social justice and greener economies. This study has further identified green skills as an important focus in research work on transitioning societies. At a methodological level, the study has shown how macro-micro and laminated system research can be useful in studying transitioning systems. As a laminated systems study with a focus on transitioning societies, it provides a baseline for further systems study on green work and green skills. At a practical level, the study has made actual contributions to the conceptualisation of learning pathways in the South African NQF context, to building and informing future green skill developments in the South African post-school system, the environmental sector and to informing conceptualising in the emergent Green Skills project...|$|R

Methods: Between 2008 - 2013, 10, 183 persons aged 20 - 85 years were enrolled in 23 hospitals and primary care centres in 12 Spanish provinces including 1, 115 cases of a new diagnosis of prostate cancer, 1, 750 of breast cancer, 2, 171 of colorectal cancer, 492 of gastro-oesophageal cancer, 554 cases of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and 4, 101 population-based controls matched by frequency to cases by age, sex and region of residence. Participation rates ranged from 57 % (stomach cancer) to 87 % (CLL cases) and from 30 % to 77 % in controls. Participants completed a face-to-face computerized interview on sociodemographic factors, <b>environmental</b> exposures, <b>occupation,</b> medication, lifestyle, and personal and family medical history. In addition, participants completed a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire and telephone interviews. Blood samples were collected from 76 % of participants while saliva samples were collected in CLL cases and participants refusing blood extractions. Clinical information was recorded for cases and paraffin blocks and/or fresh tumor samples are available in most collaborating hospitals. Genotyping was done through an exome array enriched with genetic markers in specific pathways.

40|$|International audienceThe Neolithic Revolution, which {{witnessed}} {{the transformation of}} hunter–gatherer groups into farming communities, is traditionally viewed as the event that allowed human groups to create systems of production that, in the long run, led to present-day societies. Despite the large corpus of research focused on the mechanisms and outcomes of the Neolithic transition, relatively little effort {{has been devoted to}} evaluating whether particular production-oriented adaptations could be integrated into a broad range of ecological conditions, and if specific cultural traditions differed ecologically. In order to investigate whether the differences between the adaptations and geographic distributions of three major Early Neolithic archaeological cultures are related to the exploitation of different suites of environmental conditions, we apply genetic algorithm and maximum entropy ecological niche modeling techniques to reconstruct and compare the ecological niches within which three principal Neolithic cultures (Impressed Ware, Cardial Ware, and Linearbandkeramik) spread across Europe between ca. 8000 and 7000 cal yr BP. Results show that these cultures occupied mutually exclusive suites of environmental conditions and, thus, were adapted to distinct and essentially non-overlapping ecological niches.

40|$|A land {{stratification}} of the French territory {{had been}} previously performed based on time series of vegetation and texture indices. This stratification led to 300 radiometrically homogenous regions that were considered as land units (LUs). In this paper, we present a quantitative analysis of the LUs, {{with the aim of}} testing if these LUs are linked to landscape. In this sense, an evaluation of their thematic meaning in terms of environmental variables and land cover was performed. In order to achieve this, we first conducted a statistical analysis at national scale using a set of environmental variables and land cover by means of Moran's autocorrelation index and Spearman rank correlation index. Second, to analyze the quality of the boundaries between neighboring LUs, we developed a method based on the Spearman rank correlation index calculated on test areas across the boundaries. The first analyses showed that the most explanatory variables of the LUs were land cover, topography and parent material. The boundaries analysis was applied at a regional scale (Pyrenean region), and showed that 89 % of the boundaries were well explained by the land cover compositions. The results obtained support the hypothesis that time series of broad resolution remote-sensing images can capture landscape identities and produce LUs maps that have an <b>environmental</b> and land <b>occupation</b> sense.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} the needed {{reductions}} {{in the use of}} fossil fuels call for the development of renewable energy sources. However, renewable energy production, such as hydropower (both small- and large-scale) and wind power have adverse impacts on the local environment by causing reductions in biodiversity and loss of habitats and species. This paper compares the environmental impacts of many small-scale hydropower plants with a few large-scale hydropower projects and one wind power farm, based on the same set of <b>environmental</b> parameters; land <b>occupation,</b> reduction in wilderness areas (INON), visibility and impacts on red-listed species. Our basis for comparison was similar energy volumes produced, without considering the quality of the energy services provided. The results show that small-scale hydropower performs less favourably in all parameters except land occupation. The land occupation of large hydropower and wind power is in the range of 45 – 50 m 2 /MWh, which is more than two times larger than the small-scale hydropower, where the large land occupation for large hydropower is explained by the extent of the reservoirs. On all the three other parameters small-scale hydropower performs more than two times worse than both large hydropower and wind power. Wind power compares similarly to large-scale hydropower regarding land occupation, much better on the reduction in INON areas, and in the same range regarding red-listed species. Our results demonstrate that the selected four parameters provide a basis for further development of a fair and consistent comparison of impacts between the analysed renewable technologies...|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} lung cancer among nonsmoking men are few. This case–control study was {{conducted}} among lifetime nonsmoking men between 1990 and 1996 in Germany to examine lung cancer risk in relation to <b>occupation,</b> <b>environmental</b> tobacco smoke, residential radon, family history of cancer and previous lung disease. A total of 58 male cases with confirmed primary lung cancer and 803 male population controls who had never smoked more than 400 cigarettes in their lifetime were personally interviewed by a standardized questionnaire. In addition, 1 -year radon measurements in the living and bedroom of the subjects' last dwelling were carried out. Unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Having ever worked in a job with known lung carcinogens {{was associated with a}} two-fold significantly increased lung cancer risk (OR = 2. 2; Cl = 1. 0 – 5. 0), adjusted for age and region. The linear trend test for lung-cancer risk associated with radon exposure was close to statistical significance, demonstrating an excess relative risk for an increase in exposure of 100 Bq m− 3 of 0. 43 (P = 0. 052). Nonsignificantly elevated effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in public transportation and in social settings were observed. No associations with a family history of cancer or previous lung diseases were found. Our results indicate that occupational carcinogens and indoor radon {{may play a role in}} some lung cancers in nonsmoking men. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{patterns}} of speciation is of fundamental importance to evolutionary biologists. Species diversity {{can be maintained}} and generated through processes originating from interactions with climate, biota, and geography. In order to investigate the role of these factors on diversity in a species-rich group of plants, we developed a phylogeny of the core Bromelioideae including Aechmea and related genera with the specific goals of investigating monophyly of genera, biogeographic history, morphological trait evolution, and environmental niche diversification. The phylogenetic estimation encompassed 20 genera and 4 genomic regions including chloroplast, low-copy, and ribosomal nuclear genes. Subsequently, morphologies were re-explored to understand species relationships {{that had not been}} previously recognized and to determine if morphological synapomorphies could define well supported clades. Species were coded as present or absent in 16 geographic regions to reconstruct ancestral areas. Finally, to understand how species within this group divided climatic niche space, research was focused on two clades that diversified independently in Central America. Niche models were generated for each species and for the clades as a whole and were compared for overlap. The distribution of each environmental variable for all occurrence records was compared at each node of divergence within each clade to understand divergence in environmental conditions in a method free from model uncertainty. From these analyses we found: (1) Lack of monophyly in many genera and subgenera (2) Closely related species often were found in geographic sympatry (at the scale of co-occurrence in the same country or state) such that taxonomic groups that had been thought to include geographically disjunct species, actually were representative of distinct evolutionary histories (3) Morphological traits that had been used to assign species to genera were often homoplastic (through convergence or reversals of plesiomorphic states) (4) Although a single unique synapomorphy for each clade was not found, morphological traits were often consistent within clades, providing independent support for the molecular phylogenetic estimation and a basis for future taxonomic work (5) Most well supported clades diversified within one of eight geographic areas, although the ancestral areas for several larger clades remains uncertain (6) Both clades native to Central America are found in a unique environmental niche (i. e. environmental niche models of each clade do not overlap and there is significant divergence of climatic variables between the clades) (7) Species within the clade composed of species with greater morphological variation had more environmental niche overlap than the clade with little morphological variation. These findings add to the evolutionary knowledge of the Bromeliaceae and suggest that geographic range should be taken into account when assigning species to genera. Centers of diversity of the core Bromelioids are found within eastern and Amazonian Brazil, northern south America and Central America and each radiation could have been influenced by climate in a variety of ways. In the two studied examples, species divergence is coincident with divergence in <b>environmental</b> niche <b>occupation.</b> However, <b>environmental</b> niche evolution was limited such that each clade as a whole was not modeled in the niche of the other clade, suggesting either some degree of niche conservatism or competition preventing parapatric niche expansion...|$|R
40|$|Four midden sites {{located in}} close {{proximity}} on the southern shore of the Great Salt Pond of Block Island, Rhode Island were excavated in 1986. These sites represent a temporal sequence extending from the early Middle Woodland (ca. 200 B. C. -A. D. 500) to the Contact Period (A. D. 1700). Excellent shell and bone preservation in these sites provide {{a unique opportunity to}} study patterns of subsistence change and to relate these to changes in settlement patterns and sociopolitical complexity of prehistoric-historic Amerindian cultures of southern New England. ^ The purpose of this analysis is (1) to determine the availability of faunal resources and the nature of habitats exploited; (2) to determine the significance of shellfish gathering, fishing, and maritime and terrestrial hunting in the total seasonal subsistence round; and (3) to ascertain the degree of culture change and continuity of Block Island Amerindians over the last 1700 years. ^ Faunal assemblages of the Mott 2 ̆ 7 s Midden (RI 1407), Trims Pond (RI 124), Island Cemetery (RI 120), and Fort Island (RI 118) sites were analyzed for seasonality of <b>occupation,</b> <b>environmental</b> catchment utilization, animal exploitation patterns, and site type, size and activities. ^ Results suggest a pattern of cultural continuity through the Woodland Period followed by a change in the use of faunal resources at early historic times. The Middle to Late Woodland sites are base camps occupied from winter to early spring, whose occupants concentrated on inshore, littoral animal species, especially sea mammals and migratory birds. The Contact Period Fort Island Site is the only year round village occupation and the only site yielding evidence of the use of maize. In addition, animal exploitation patterns shifted to a greater use of marine fishing and inland freshwater resources. ^ Culture changes on Block Island occurred late in prehistory and in response to the advent of horticulture as a resource base. Horticultural activities would favor a shift toward sedentary settlement on the island and the increased span of occupation would lead to different animal procurement patterns. During early historic times, the increased production of wampum as a means of exchange with European traders may have accentuated the processes leading to larger and more sedentary populations on Block Island. ...|$|R
40|$|Statement of Purpose: This study {{applied a}} {{theoretically}} guided coding scheme {{to summarize the}} interacting factors reported in the results of qualitative research studies to determine how subjective experiences of occupation and supports or barriers to occupational performance influence occupation. Description of Methods: A total of 11 qualitative studies from the Journal of Occupational Science (JOS) were identified through {{a search of the}} keyword, “meaning” within JOS article titles (date range: 1997 - 2010). A four-category a-priori coding scheme guided the meta-summary consisting of 1) positive and 2) negative subjective experience related to occupation, as well as 3) supports and 4) barriers to optimal or continued occupational performance. Codes associated with subjective experience related to occupation arose from the understanding that subjective experience is essential to defining occupation [1] and these experiences could be considered as having either a positive or negative affective valence [2]. Codes related to the supports and barriers to occupational performance were created to reflect a causal or transactional influence of personal or <b>environmental</b> factors upon <b>occupation</b> [3 - 5]. A total of 3 researchers were grouped in pairs to review and apply the coding scheme to the articles. Statements of research findings within the Results section of each article were used as primary data for applying the coding scheme. Disagreement in coding was resolved through the consensus of the three researchers. Report of Results: The a-priori coding scheme was an efficient and informative way to categorize the findings across studies. A total of 440 codes were applied; the most common individually applied codes were positive subjective experience associated with occupation (n = 72) and support to occupational performance (n = 67). The most commonly applied code combinations indicated positive subjective experiences supported occupational performance (n = 84) and negative subjective experiences hindered occupational performance (n = 24). Findings also indicated specific personal or environmental factors which both support and hinder occupational performance, and that positive and negative subjective experiences may occur simultaneously with respect to occupation. Finally, the articles were far more likely to report positive rather than negative experiences associated with occupation as well as supports rather than barriers to occupational performance. Discussion Questions: What can be learned when a theoretically guided a-priori coding strategy is applied in a qualitative meta-summary study? Can a theoretically guided a-priori coding strategy serve as a useful way to categorize qualitative data...|$|R
40|$|O rio Jaguaribe foi {{fundamental}} para o desenvolvimento da cidade do Aracati. Nas Ãltimas dÃcadas verifica-se a degradaÃÃo do ecossistema fluviomarinho ocasionado por vÃrios impactos ambientais. Analisar os impactos socioambientais no estuÃrio do rio Jaguaribe, destacando o processo de expansÃo urbana da cidade entre os anos de 1980 a 2008, relacionados com o desenvolvimento do turismo, da indÃstria e o agronegÃcio da carcinicultura e sugerir medidas que reduzam os impactos ambientais Ã o principal objetivo deste trabalho. A teoria geossistÃmica contribuiu como mÃtodo para a anÃlise das relaÃÃes entre o processo de urbanizaÃÃo, as formas de uso e ocupaÃÃo das unidades geoambientais e os impactos socioambientais no estuÃrio do rio Jaguaribe. Utilizou-se o roteiro de entrevista semiestruturada e o enfoque fenomenolÃgico como procedimento qualitativo para compreender e interpretar a visÃo da sociedade em relaÃÃo Ã importÃncia e a degradaÃÃo ambiental no rio Jaguaribe. AtravÃs do trabalho de campo foi possÃvel observar o modo de vida da sociedade e entrevistar agentes polÃticos e lideranÃas comunitÃrias locais. Constatouse que a urbanizaÃÃo acelerada da cidade, nas Ãltimas dÃcadas, foi responsÃvel pelos seguintes impactos socioambientais: ocupaÃÃo irregular das margens fluviais, contaminaÃÃo do solo atravÃs do lanÃamento de esgoto oriundo de fossas sÃpticas, que correspondem a 80 % do destino final dos efluentes domÃsticos da cidade e o tratamento ineficiente dos resÃduos sÃlidos no lixÃo inserido no bairro Pedregal. O agronegÃcio da carcinicultura desenvolvido no estuÃrio do rio Jaguaribe promoveu o desmatamento do manguezal, o lanÃamento de efluentes no rio contendo substÃncias quÃmicas utilizadas nos criatÃrios de camarÃo; instalaÃÃo de empreendimentos sem as licenÃas dos ÃrgÃos ambientais, promovendo o assoreamento, a reduÃÃo de 60 % das espÃcies marÃtimas e estuarinas, o comprometimento da fauna silvestre causado pelo desmatamento do mangue, promovendo prejuÃzos econÃmicos para os pescadores. A conclusÃo obtida Ã que sÃo necessÃrias iniciativas de conservaÃÃo e recuperaÃÃo das Ãreas degradadas, dentre elas: uma rigorosa fiscalizaÃÃo, por parte dos agentes pÃblicos e dos ÃrgÃos ambientais das esferas municipal, estadual e federal; o cumprimento da legislaÃÃo ambiental que proÃbe a ocupaÃÃo de APPâs; maior participaÃÃo das comunidades tradicionais nas decisÃes sobre a instalaÃÃo de empreendimentos econÃmicos; a implementaÃÃo de projetos de educaÃÃo ambiental em parceria com a sociedade aracatiense, a fim de que esta atue como agente de fiscalizaÃÃo e conservaÃÃo do patrimÃnio natural da cidade. The Jaguaribe River was {{fundamental to}} the development of the city of Aracati. However, during recent decades a degradation of the fluvial and marine ecosystems caused by several environmental impacts has been perceived. Analyzing the social and environmental impacts at the estuary of the Jaguaribe River, highlighting the process of urban expansion from 1980 to 2008, related to the tourism, industry and the shrimp farming agribusiness developments and suggesting measures that reduce the environmental impacts are the main objectives of this work. The Geo-systemic Theory contributed as the method used to analyze the connexion among the urbanization process, the means of use and occupancy of the geo-environmental units and the social and environmental impacts at the estuary of the Jaguaribe River. The semi-structured interview guide and the phenomenology focus were used as the qualitative procedure applied to understand and interpret the societyâs perspective towards the importance as well as the environmental degradation of the Jaguaribe River. Through the fieldwork was possible to observe the societyâs lifestyle and interview political agents and local community leaders. It was found that the accelerated urbanization of the city during recent decades was responsible for the following social and <b>environmental</b> impacts: irregular <b>occupation</b> of the banks, soil contamination due to the release of sewage originated in septic cesspool, which represent 80 % of the final disposal of the cityâs domestic effluents, and the ineffective treatment of the solid waste at the landfill located in the Pedregal neighborhood. The shrimp farming agribusiness developed in the estuary of the Jaguaribe River promoted the deforestation of the mangroves, the release of sewage containing chemical substances used in the shrimp farms into the river; settlement of new enterprises without permits from environmental agencies, promoting the sedimentation, the reduction of 60 % of the marine and estuarine species, the endangerment of the wildlife caused by the deforestation of the mangrove, promoting economic losses for fishermen. The conclusion we got is that some conservation and restoration initiatives in the degraded areas are necessaries, including: strict inspection by the state officials and municipal, state and federal environmental agencies, the enforcement of the environmental legislation which prohibits the occupation of the areas of permanent protection, the greater participation of traditional communities in decisions about the settlement of economic enterprises, the implementation of environmental education projects in partnership with the civil aracatiense society, so that it acts as agent for inspection and conservation of the natural heritage of the city...|$|R
