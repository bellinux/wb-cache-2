25|$|Although Cisco was not {{the first}} company to develop and sell <b>dedicated</b> <b>network</b> nodes, {{it was one of the}} first to sell commercially {{successful}} routers supporting multiple network protocols. Classical, CPU-based architecture of early Cisco devices coupled with flexibility of operating system IOS allowed for keeping up with evolving technology needs by means of frequent software upgrades. Some popular models of that time (such as Cisco 2500) managed to stay in production for almost a decade virtually unchanged—a rarity in high-tech industry. Although Cisco was strongly rooted in the enterprise environment, the company was quick to capture the emerging service provider environment, entering the SP market with new, high-capacity product lines such as Cisco 7000 and Cisco 8500.|$|E

30|$|In <b>dedicated</b> <b>networks,</b> the {{communication}} resources are entirely utilized for synchrophasor communication {{and no other}} application can utilize these resources. Thus, the source of delay would be the processing delay at the PMU and the propagation delay. Thus, <b>dedicated</b> <b>networks</b> {{can be used to}} realize all of the synchrophasor application. Shared networks are economical and can be rapidly deployed. The communication resources are shared by several applications which increases the end-to-end delay and reduces the reliability of {{the communication}} network. As the synchrophasor applications are mission-critical, it is desirable to use dedicated communication resources, even though it increases the overall cost of the system.|$|R
500|$|In September 2004, Juniper {{entered the}} market for {{enterprise}} access routers with three routers that were {{the first of the}} J-series product family. It used the channel partners acquired with NetScreen to take the routers to market. Juniper released its first <b>dedicated</b> <b>Network</b> Access Control (NAC) product in late 2005, which was followed by the acquisition of Funk Software for its NAC capabilities for switches. According to a 2006 review in Network World, Juniper's SSG 520 firewall and routing product was [...] "the first serious threat" [...] to competing products from Cisco. Juniper released the SRX family of gateway products in 2008. The gateways sold well, but customers and resellers reported a wide range of technical issues starting in 2010, which Juniper did not acknowledge until 2012, when it began providing updates to the product software.|$|E

2500|$|In 1901 the {{engineer}} Vladimir Pechkovsky presented his project {{to build an}} elevated station {{in the middle of}} Nevsky Prospect, opposite the Kazan Cathedral, and to link it, via elevated and underground sections of track (above the Ekaterinsky and Obvodny canals and beneath the Zabalkansky prospect) with the Baltiysky and Varshavsky Rail Terminals. In the same year, Reshevsky, also an engineer, working {{at the behest of the}} Emperor's minister for transport, came up with two possible projects, which aimed primarily to unite all of Saint Petersburg's main railway stations with one urban interchange. An interesting development, the work upon which had been carried out for many years by railway engineer P I Balinsky (one of the first Russian metro engineers) involved plans to build a <b>dedicated</b> <b>network</b> of six urban lines, two of which would be radial lines with a total length of [...] The construction work (including the filling of low-lying areas of the city in order to avoid flooding, construction of 11 major bridges, embankments and viaducts at a height of , and the actual laying of track etc.) was projected to cost around 190 million rubles.

40|$|The {{significance}} of high-performance <b>dedicated</b> <b>networks</b> {{has been well}} recognized due to the rapidly increasing number of large-scale applications that require high-speed data transfer. Efficient algorithms are needed for path computation and bandwidth scheduling in <b>dedicated</b> <b>networks</b> to improve the utilization of network resources and meet diverse user requests. We consider two periodic bandwidth scheduling problems: multiple data transfer allocation (MDTA) and multiple fixed-slot bandwidth reservation (MFBR), both of which schedule a number of user requests accumulated in a certain period. MDTA is to assign multiple data transfer requests on several pre-specified network paths to minimize the total data transfer end time, while MFBR is to satisfy multiple bandwidth reservation requests, each of which specifies a bandwidth and a time slot. For MDTA, we design an optimal algorithm and provide its correctness proof; for MFBR, we prove it to be NP-complete and propose a heuristic algorithm, Minimal Bandwidth and Distance Product Algorithm (MBDPA). Extensive simulation results illustrate the performance superiority of the proposed MBDPA over a greedy heuristic approach and provide valuable insight into the advantage of periodic bandwidth scheduling over instant bandwidth scheduling...|$|R
