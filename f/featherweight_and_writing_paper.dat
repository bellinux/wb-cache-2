30|$|To {{clarify the}} {{socioeconomic}} factors influencing global paper and paperboard demand, a panel data {{analysis was conducted}} covering the period 1961 – 2014. This study used paper and paperboard demand as the dependent variable, and a country’s economic level, Internet usage rate, plastic packaging demand, and time trend as the explanatory variables. An inverse U-shaped quadratic relationship, such as an environmental Kuznets curve, was found between economic level and paper and paperboard demand, which saturates and begins to decline as economic level increases. The economic level representing the turning point differs significantly with the use, ranging from around 37, 000 US$/person for newsprint paper to around 66, 000 US$/person for printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper.</b> For both newsprint <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper,</b> demand declines owing {{to the spread of}} the Internet as the economic level rises, although this reductive effect is greater for printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> than for newsprint paper. A substitution relationship is not found between wrapping paper and corrugated cardboard {{on the one hand and}} plastic packaging on the other hand as the economic level becomes higher.|$|R
40|$|After {{many decades}} of growth, {{evolutionary}} innovation and acquisitions, the Finnish printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> industry finds itself {{mired in a}} deep crisis {{after the turn of}} the century. The Finnish printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> industry is a casualty of its own success, i. e., it did not realize in a timely manner that revolutionary innovation, i. e. digitalisation, challenged its business model and long term growth opportunities, and further evolutionary innovation could not solve this challenge. The problem was worsened by university programmes and an innovation ecosystem which were geared toward efficiency improvements with the help of evolutionary innovation. The drop in demand for printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> in North America and Europe has been a wake-up call for the Finnish forest industry, and the industry is attempting to reinvent itself and change its innovation ecosystem. The most significant challenge is to change the prevailing mentality and culture in the industry.

40|$|In this dissertation, I explore two {{questions}} related to revisionist views of environmental regulations and trade. First, I explore the implications of more stringent standards when these standards both benefit and cost producers and consumers. Second, I empirically explore the impact of one major US environmental policy change in the {{pulp and paper industry}} on productivity and trade. ^ In Part One, I discuss how a stricter labeling standard affects consumer welfare when the labeled goods markets in two countries are integrated, and how a bilateral tariff rate reduction affects consumer welfare. I discuss each issue under two different international trade models: a national product differentiation model and a monopolistic competition model. Different trade models do yield different results. ^ The second question is related to the promulgation of the 2 ̆ 2 cluster rule 2 ̆ 2 for the US pulp and paper industry, implemented by the US Environmental Protection Agency in 1998. This stricter environmental regulation required US pulp and paper producers to invest large amounts of capital to bring themselves into compliance. ^ I use data from five major categories of the US pulp and paper industry [...] -newsprint, paperboard, printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper,</b> sulfate pulp, <b>and</b> Kraft paper [...] -to investigate if the change induced by the cluster rule improved the productivity of producers and impacted trade flows between the US and Canada. ^ The empirical results show that the impact of the cluster rule on the US domestic sales price and the export price to Canada is negative and significant for the paperboard, printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> Kraft paper industries. ^ The US cluster rule increased Canadian imports of US paperboard, printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper,</b> <b>and</b> Kraft paper products. However, the value of Canadian imports from the US increased only for paperboard and Kraft paper products, while the value decreased for printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> products because the own-price elasticity of import demand from the US to Canada is less than one for that industry. For US imports from Canada, the cluster rule decreased the value of trade flows in printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> Kraft paper products. ...|$|R

30|$|The results (Table  3) of {{the panel}} data {{analysis}} by model (5) show that newsprint <b>paper</b> <b>and</b> printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> have a substitution relationship with the Internet as the economic level rises. However, the reductive effect of Internet use on printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> begins to manifest at a relatively low economic level while the effect on newsprint paper is not observed until the economic level has risen substantially. Specifically, the economic levels are 14, 183 US$/person or more [(7.29 e− 05  −  5.14 e− 09  ×  14, 182) >  0  > (7.29 e− 05  −  5.14 e− 09  ×  14, 183)] and 21, 189 US$/person or more [(5.17 e− 05  −  2.44 e− 09  ×  21, 188) >  0  > (5.17 e− 05  −  2.44 e− 09  ×  21, 189)], respectively. Conversely, Hujala [19] reported that {{the spread of the}} Internet has reduced demand for newsprint paper, but has had a negligible impact on the demand for printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper.</b> Latta et al. [20] showed that the spread of the Internet has driven the decline in demand for newsprint paper, while only in the United States and other OECD countries has the demand for printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper</b> also decreased. For our analysis, we covered more countries and more recent years (104 countries for the period 1990 – 2014) than previous studies have (50 countries for the period 1990 – 2007 [19]; 6 major world regions for the period 1970 – 2011 [20]). As a result, we surmise that globally in recent years, a substitution relationship with Internet use is observed both for newsprint paper and for printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper.</b> However, because the models used for the regression analysis differ from those of previous studies, more detailed comparison between them is difficult. In newsprint paper, {{there is a possibility that}} as per capita GDP increased, the per capita demand decreased for the period 1990 – 2014 from the results (Table  3) by model (5). When we conducted the regression analysis using only per capita GDP as the explanatory variable for that period for model (5), the regression coefficient for per capita GDP was negative, confirming the statistical significance. This indicates that the demand for newsprint decreased as economic level rose in recent years after 1990. Looking at the time trend, in newsprint paper, the regression coefficient for the time trend was negative and was confirmed to be statistically significant. This demonstrates the presence of other factors with a reductive effect on demand, such as advances in technology for reducing the weight of newsprint paper, the reorientation towards digital media in the advertising industry, and improvement of Internet line speed. Meanwhile, in printing <b>and</b> <b>writing</b> <b>paper,</b> the time trend was not statistically significant, indicating that the impact on demand from other factors with a time trend is insignificant.|$|R
