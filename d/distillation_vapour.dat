40|$|The vapour {{recompression}} scheme (VRC) {{has been}} very effective in continuous distillation for energy intensification. The applicability of this scheme for the separation of multicomponent wide boiling constituents in batch distillation is a major challenge, because of the unsteady nature of the batch. In this study, the vapour recompression scheme has been implemented for the separation of multicomponent wide boiling constituents in the batch distillation. For the optimal usage of energy from compressed vapours manipulation of top tray vapour or external energy is done. A comparative study of the vapour recompressed batch distillation having a variable speed single compressor (SVRBD) and double stage compressor (DVRBD) with conventional batch distillation in terms of energy savings and total annualized cost is done. The VRC schemes achieve an energy savings of 50 % and 10. 03 % total annualized cost (TAC) for SVRBD and DVRBD achieve 52 % energy savings and 12. 21 % TAC with a payback period of 10 years.

50|$|Chase Vodka is {{a premium}} potato-based vodka made from {{specialty}} potato varieties such as Lady Claire and King Edward. It is a single-estate vodka, {{meaning that the}} base ingredients used for the vodka are produced on site (including the apples used for Naked Chase Apple Vodka). The production process involves peeling, heating and mashing the potatoes before adding yeast for fermentation. Next the potatoes are transferred to a traditional copper pot still where steam is used to raise the temperature and encourage <b>distillation.</b> <b>Vapours</b> rise up through the 70 ft tall rectification column, resulting in a vodka that has effectively been distilled 119 times. Finally, distilled water from the onsite borehole - which draws water from underneath the farm’s apple trees - is used to dilute the vodka to 40% ABV.|$|R

40|$|The Melt-Leach-Evaporation (MLE) {{process is}} under {{development}} for the extraction of valuable Group IA or IIA metals of the Periodic Table, such as lithium, calcium, magnesium and strontium. The process consists of mixing and contacting the value metal source material, which might be an ore or concentrate, with an excess of molten metal which is acting as a reductant and lixiviant. In the process, the value metal extracted from the source material is dissolved in the excess molten metallic solvent and is subsequently extracted as a <b>vapour</b> by vacuum <b>distillation.</b> The <b>vapour</b> is condensed and recuperated in the metallic state. An experimental program involving eight experiments was carried out.

40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{two options}} to reducing energy consumption of <b>distillation</b> columns namely <b>vapour</b> recompression and thermal coupling (split tower). These methods {{are applied to}} an equimolal, saturated liquid feed mixture of methanol-water system. The system produces a saturated distillate product of 95 mol % methanol and a saturated liquid bottom of 5 mol % methanol. The energy requirements of the options investigated are computed and {{compared with that of}} a conventional single distillation column having the same system objectives. The results show that the conventional single distillation column consumes 2298. 611 kW, vapour recompression consumes 1528. 106 kW, saving 33. 5 % of the total energy requirement, while thermal coupling consumes 2039. 927 kW, saving 11. 25 % of the total energy requirement. The energy servings recorded are converted into monetary values and the economic analysis computed to determine the best economically viable option. The results show that vapour recompression is the best economically viable option amongst the options investigated and worthy of investment. The time length to recover the investments on the major equipment used for each option is also computed and this is based on the anticipated annual profit for four years of plant operatio...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} study, a novel {{approach}} for separating ethanol-water mixture by microbubble distillation technology was investigated. Traditional distillation processes require large amounts of energy to raise the liquid to its boiling point to effect removal of volatile components. The concept of microbubble distillation by comparison is to heat the gas phase rather than the liquid phase to achieve separation. The removal of ethanol from the thermally sensitive fermentation broths was taken as a case of study. Consequently the results were then compared with those which could be obtained under equilibrium conditions expected in an “ideal” distillation unit. Microbubble <b>distillation</b> has achieved <b>vapour</b> compositions higher than that which could be obtained under traditional equilibrium conditions. The separation was achieved at liquid temperature significantly less than the boiling point of the mixture. In addition, {{it was observed that}} the separation efficiency of the microbubble distillation could be increased by raising the injected air temperature, while the temperature of the liquid mixture increased only moderately. The separation efficiency of microbubble distillation was compared with that of pervaporation for the recovery of bioethanol from the thermally sensitive fermentation broths. The technology could be controlled to give high separation and energy efficiency. This could contribute to improving commercial viability of biofuel production and other coproducts of biorefinery processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{industrial}} sector {{is a large}} consumer of energy. Globally, this sector accounts for {{over half of the}} energy used. As anthropogenic emissions increase, and the consequences of these emissions become more evident, the incentive for energy reduction is clear. Heat pumps are readily available for low temperature applications in the residential sector, but has yet to make a breakthrough in industry. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} energy and cost savings such installations can induce. To make heat pumps more attractive for industrial applications, it is important to demonstrate their potential. This master thesis investigates one such case, namely the implementation of a high temperature heat pump in a distillation plant. The heat pump will fulfill two purposes. First, it will cool down a waste stream to allow operation during warm summer months. Due to environmental restrictions, the availability of cooling water from a nearby river is restricted. Secondly, it will replace bought energy by using the condenser heat to preheat a <b>distillation</b> feed. A <b>vapour</b> compression cycle was simulated by a model made in EES. Suitable natural working fluids for high temperature applications were investigated with respect to cycle performance and their influence on component design. The case investigated gave the boundary conditions for the model, e. g. temperature levels and heat duty. In addition, an economic model was implemented to optimize the heat pump with respect to the total system costs, including component costs and the energy efficiency of the system. The working fluid with the best performance was n-butane, with a coefficient of performance close to 6. The requirement for this was a large evaporator which gave a small pinch temperature between the working fluid and water. The added investment costs of a larger evaporator could be justified by the reduced total costs due to lower operational costs...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of gas hydrates {{have been known}} to cause serious problems with blockages in natural gas pipelines, wellbore and natural gas processing units. The offshore sector of the North Sea comes into focus owing to factors such as low temperature, high pressure because of deep water fields, great depth of the subsea environment and remote locations that are factors underlying the increased hydrate formation. Hydrates are formed in multiphase transport comprising gas, condensate and water. Produced water must be cleaned {{if it is to be}} re-injected into the formation, or discharged into the sea or other water bodies, hence due to potential recycling of the inhibitor. One of the main purposes of water treatment is to distinguish the previously injected thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor in Gas-Condensate production. The aim of the thesis is to conduct a simulation study to determine the distribution of various thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors and H 2 O, in water treatment, using a Distillation Column. The distribution of thermodynamic hydrate inhibitors between the three phases, Vapour, Liquid and Aqueous Phase was also studied. The software used to complete this task was Aspen Tech HYSYS. The data used are respectively from the Shell operated gas field Ormen Lange at the Norwegian Continental Shelf and the corresponding land-based processing facility; Nyhamna. Three cases have been studied in this thesis; the use of Methanol, Ethanol and Mono-Ethylene Glycol as hydrate inhibitor. The results show that the use of Distillation Column alone in HYSYS is not suitable for the process of separate water and Methanol due to the dispersed distribution in the column. Distillation process gives a perfect distribution of Ethanol with 100 % lean Ethanol leaving the <b>Distillation</b> Column as <b>vapour,</b> but indicates only a small amount of Ethanol left after transportation. The results refer to a perfect distribution of Mono-Ethylene Glycol leading to a simplified process for recycling. The bottom product stream contains pure quantity of Mono-Ethylene Glycol and the process is optimal for the use of Mono-Ethylene Glycol as a thermodynamic hydrate inhibitor. </p...|$|R
40|$|Western boreal peatlands have diverse ground {{covers of}} Sphagnum and brown mosses that have {{important}} hydrological controls on peatland-atmosphere interactions. Since peatland mosses are non-vascular, their shoot structural morphologies and community growth forms affect the storage and fluxes {{of water that}} are critical for maintaining productivity and evaporative functions. While many of the mechanisms of capillary rise are fairly well understood for Sphagnum mosses, there is less information on the water dynamics in communities of Tomenthypnum nitens, a dominant brown moss species in northern rich fens. This study investigated how the different hydrophysical characteristics of moss and peat profiles of T. nitens from a rich fen and intermixed Sphagnum angustifolium and Sphagnum magellanicum, from a poor fen affect capillary flow and water retention to support evaporation and productivity; and how different groundwater and atmospheric sources of water affected these processes. Laboratory investigations indicated volumetric water content and gross ecosystem productivity decrease with water table depth for both mosses without the advent of precipitation, with Sphagnum capitula retaining 10 - 20 % more water than T. nitens due to its moss structure and pore connectivity with the water table. Consequently, Sphagnum capillary rise was sufficient to sustain both high pore-water pressures for evaporation and high water content for productivity at all water table depths due to a gradual shift in average water-retaining pore sizes with depth. The structure of T. nitens moss turfs, consisting of live shoots and a basal layer of old, partially decomposed shoots sometimes overlying well-decomposed peat makes capillary rise more difficult, requiring extremely low matric pressures at the surface, sometimes causing desiccation of the uppermost portions of moss shoots, and hence reduced productivity. Additional nocturnal sources of atmospheric water from dew, <b>distillation,</b> and <b>vapour</b> fluxes provide small, but potentially critical sources of water to rewet desiccated moss shoots for early morning productivity for both T. nitens and Sphagnum mosses. Investigations in the field, however, indicated that with frequent precipitation to rewet the moss and the turf base to refill large pores, evaporative demands at the T. nitens moss canopy could drive capillary flow from the water table to maintain adequate θ for productivity. T. nitens mosses also can grow in turfs disconnected from the underlying iii peat, so that the basal layer temporarily retains water from precipitation for capillary rise. Thus, while capillary connection of the T. nitens moss turf with the underlying peat and water table is not critical to maintain productivity, it grows in a relatively large range of elevations from the water table, compared to Sphagnum and feather mosses. Rewetting of the capitula and the raising of the water table by precipitation provided higher water matric pressures within the moss matrix, and along with high evaporative demands, provided the mechanisms for sufficient capillary flow for productivity. Thus, Sphagnum could grow in habitats far from the water table like feather mosses, although the latter did not require capillary rise for productivity. Furthermore, disequilibrium between water vapour and liquid in the pores of T. nitens in the near-surface suggested pressures calculated with the Kelvin equation may not provide an accurate characterization of actual matric pressures in the moss. However, as the disequilibrium is caused by vapour pressure gradients between the moss and the atmosphere, it is likely a driving factor that helps maintain vapour and capillary water fluxes to provide moisture for T. nitens and other mosses. These results illustrate hydrological mechanisms that explain how moss growth form and habitat are linked. As such, the Sphagnum and T. nitens mosses are well adapted to maintain capillary in their poorly drained habitats in western boreal peatlands...|$|R
