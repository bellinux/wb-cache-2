5|$|In a final onslaught, Bellatrix {{is killed}} and Harry reveals to Voldemort {{that he is}} alive. He {{explains}} to Voldemort the Elder Wand's loyalty transfers upon the defeat, not necessarily the killing, of its previous master. Although Voldemort believes by killing Snape he has gained the Wand's loyalty, Snape was in fact never <b>its</b> <b>master.</b> Instead, Draco Malfoy earned the Wand's loyalty when he disarmed Dumbledore just before Snape arrived. Harry believes the Elder Wand recognized Draco as <b>its</b> <b>master,</b> {{up to the point}} where Harry disarmed Draco at Malfoy Manor weeks prior, and the duel will depend on whether or not the wand recognizes Harry to be <b>its</b> <b>master.</b> Voldemort attempts one final Killing Curse on Harry, but the Elder Wand refuses to act against Harry and the spell rebounds, killing Voldemort at last.|$|E

5|$|Ibn Tulun {{stands out}} as the first {{governor}} of a major province of the Abbasid Caliphate to not only establish himself as <b>its</b> <b>master</b> independently of the Abbasid court, but to also pass power on to his son. He was thus also the first ruler since the Ptolemaic Pharaohs to make Egypt an independent political power again, with a sphere of influence encompassing Syria {{and parts of the}} Maghreb, setting the tone for later Egypt-based Islamic regimes, from the Ikhshidids to the Mamluk Sultanate of Cairo.|$|E

5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent gaze of Apep's own Eye is a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's Eye {{is one of the}} few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the Eye of Ra from <b>its</b> <b>master</b> during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the Eye of Ra is another point of overlap with the Eye of Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E
5|$|The dog {{leaves the}} house and swims back across the river, {{down the street and}} into <b>its</b> <b>master</b> and mistress's home. In a study, the child's father is sitting; Rover enters and pleads with him to follow. They leave, with the man {{following}} the dog across the river in a boat to the slums. They enter the room where the child is hidden, and the father quickly takes the child from the beggar woman and leaves with the dog. Upon their return home, the child is placed in the arms of the mother, while Rover prances happily around them.|$|E

5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer Rouge and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as <b>its</b> <b>master.</b> The Khmer Rouge were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer Rouge, hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer Rouge, this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
5|$|The heat is made {{tangible}} by the flustered {{appearance of}} the woman as she fans herself (the fan itself displays a classical scene—perhaps Venus, Adonis and Cupid); the sluggish pregnant dog that looks longingly towards the water; and the vigorous vine growing {{on the side of}} the tavern. As is often the case in Hogarth's work, the dog's expression reflects that of <b>its</b> <b>master.</b> The family rush home, past the New River and a tavern with a sign showing Sir Hugh Myddleton, who bankrupted himself financing the construction of the river to bring running water into London in 1613 (a wooden pipe lies by the side of the watercourse). Through the open window other refugees from the city can be seen sheltering from the oppressive heat in the bar. While they appear more jolly than the dyer and his family, Hogarth pokes fun at these people escaping to the country for fresh air only to reproduce the smoky air and crowded conditions of the city by huddling in the busy tavern with their pipes.|$|E
5|$|The sailor {{offers to}} pay a reward, but Dupin is {{interested}} only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders. The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris, but had trouble keeping it under control. When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor, imitating his morning grooming, it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue, where it climbed up and into the house. The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor, imitating a barber; when she screamed in fear, it flew into a rage, ripped her hair out, slashed her throat, and strangled the daughter. The sailor climbed up the lightning rod {{in an attempt to}} catch the animal, and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him. Fearing punishment by <b>its</b> <b>master,</b> the orangutan threw the mother's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the five}} spans {{of the current}} bridge are far wider than the {{nineteen}} spans of the original bridge, Battersea Bridge's location on a sharp bend in the river still presents a hazard to navigation. In 1948, the MV Delta jammed under the bridge, and <b>its</b> <b>master</b> Hendrikus Oostring suffered broken arms {{and needed to be}} rescued from the smashed wheelhouse. On 23 March 1950, the collier John Hopkinson collided with the central pier, causing serious structural damage, leaving the tram tracks as the only element holding the bridge together. The London County Council was concerned that the entire structure would collapse and closed the bridge until January 1951. Tram services in the area were withdrawn on 30 September 1950, so when the bridge was reopened the tram tracks were lifted. Another serious incident took place on 21 September 2005, when the James Prior, a 200-ton barge, collided with the bridge, causing serious structural damage costing over £500,000 to repair. The bridge was closed to all motor vehicles other than buses while repairs were carried out, causing severe traffic congestion; it eventually reopened on 16 January 2006. Brian King, the master of the James Prior, was formally cleared of navigating without due care and attention in 2008, when the judge in the case injured his back and was unable to proceed, and prosecutors decided not to re-present the case.|$|E
