Is the South African criminal law, however, keeping up? The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate whether the various activities which form part of the criminal business value chain relating to counterfeit card fraud, with specific reference to bank payment cards, are sufficiently criminalised in South Africa or whether the inability of our criminal law to address the challenges posed by this crime type necessitates the introduction of further legislation. In the first part of the dissertation the South African common and statutory criminal law is investigated in some depth to establish the applicability thereof on the activities forming part of the criminal business value chain relevant to counterfeit card fraud. The appropriateness of certain statutory provisions is questioned and recommendations are made to amend current legislation. An argument is also advanced for further development of the common-law offence of theft to include identity theft and the unlawful copying and subsequent use of data. Brief reference is made to the international situation. Chapter 2 is an introduction to bank payment card fraud in South Africa focusing on the most prevalent forms thereof being card-not-present fraud and counterfeit card fraud.

This study focused on how to use the policy <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>Payments</b> for Ecosystem Services (PES) to ensure the success of water protection of the middle route project. Non-market valuation was conducted in this study to provide policy suggestions on the design of PES schemes for water protection. From the service demand perspective, a Contingent Valuation survey with a total of 755 questionnaires was conducted in 4 cities (i. e. Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang and Zhengzhou) along the water transfer route in order to investigate urban residents’ Willingness To Pay (WTP) for the service of water protection. From the service supply perspective, a Choice Experiment survey with 246 questionnaires was conducted in 7 villages in the water supply area in order to reveal farmer households’ preferences for different designs of two water protection programs, namely the existing Sloping Land Conversion Program (SLCP) for reforestation and a hypothetical fertilizer reduction program. Results of the Contingent Valuation survey indicate that urban residents’ WTP for water protection was significantly influenced by their income, their knowledge of the water transfer project and their attitudes to the general idea of PES. Model estimation results show that, on average, respondents in Beijing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang and Zhengzhou were willing to pay an increase of 0. 71, 0. 25, 0. 39 and 0. 36 yuan/m 3 in the water price, respectively.

Although the <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> <b>payments</b> for ecosystem services (PES) has emerged as a promising tool to safeguard or enhance the provision of ecosystem services (ES), little {{attention has been paid to}} the potential role of PES in climate change adaptation. As an external stressor climate change has an impact on the social-ecological system in which PES takes place, including the various actors taking part in the PES scheme. Following a short description of the conceptual link between PES and adaptation to climate change, we provide practical insights into the relationship between PES and adaptation to climate change by presenting results from a case study of a rural watershed in Kenya. Drawing upon the results of a participatory vulnerability assessment among potential ecosystem service providers in Sasumua watershed north of Nairobi, we show that PES can play a role in enhancing adaptation to climate change by influencing certain elements of adaptive capacity and incentivizing adaptation measures. In addition, trade-offs and synergies between proposed measures under PES and adaptation to climate change are identified. Results show that although it may not be possible to establish PES schemes based on water utilities as the sole source of financing, embedding PES in a wider adaptation framework creates an opportunity for the development of watershed PES schemes in Africa and ensures their sustainability. We conclude that there is a need to embed PES in a wider institutional framework and that extra financial resources are needed to foster greater integration between PES and adaptation to climate change. This can be achieved through scaling up PES by bringing in other buyers and additional ecosystem services. PES can achieve important coadaptation benefits, but for more effective adaptation outcomes it needs to be combined with vulnerability assessments and climate scenarios to ensure that these are realized and potential trade-offs between PES measures and adaptation measures minimized...|$|R

40|$|LL. M. (Banking Law) Abstract: The {{debates and}} {{questions}} surrounding illegality {{as an exception}} to the seemingly immaculate autonomy doctrine of documentary letters of credit and demand guarantees are not few. Fraud {{on the part of the}} beneficiary <b>of</b> these abstract <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> <b>payment</b> is the established, and recognized exception in law to this doctrine in most jurisdictions around the globe. However, over the years, legal trends have suggested that fraud might not necessarily and totally be able to cover the many loopholes that this doctrine has been or might be exposed to. For this reason, amongst others, different exceptions have cropped up in many jurisdictions around the world. The illegality exception is just one of the few alternatives to the entrenched fraud exception. The illegality exception is not without its troubles. Since it has not really been entrenched in most jurisdictions, including here in South Africa, many questions as well as debates regarding its potency in law and the rules governing it, is understandably on the lips of many. For instance, some have argued that the illegality exception is more beneficial in the view of a larger public interest than the fraud exception. In the Mahonia case, an English case, the court remarked that “if a beneficiary should as a matter of public policy (ex turpi causa) be precluded from utilising a letter of credit to benefit from his own fraud, it is hard to see why he should be permitted to use the courts to enforce part of an underlying transaction which would have been unenforceable on the grounds of illegality if no letters of credit had been involved, however serious the illegality involved. ” On the other hand in the well-known United City Merchant case the court was reluctant to admit to the possibility of an illegality exception when it had the opportunity to do so. It simply remarked that instead of “illegal” such contracts will simply be “unenforceable”. The logical question therefore is: unenforceable based on which grounds? The court in the Group Josi case dealt with the position the United City Merchant case had earlier adopted. Staughton J in Group Josi accepted that illegality is a separate defence from the fraud but fell just short of settling this position in law. Central to this paper, therefore, is the critical discussion and evaluation of the different sides to the debates surrounding the recognition, scope of application as well as the effects of the illegality exception. The author will look at different cases from a number of jurisdictions, but basically focusing on the English law, in his critical analysis of this exception. In addition, the opinions and positions of academic writers and experts in the field of letters of credit and [...] ...|$|R
