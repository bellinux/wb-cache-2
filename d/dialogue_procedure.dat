40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{has a bad}} image. There seems a lack of quality in construction works {{at the time of}} delivery, and estimates of time and costs seem to be exceeded structurally, especially in public projects. Partially, {{this has to do with}} the increased complexity of construction projects. Therefore, procuring agencies and contractors feel the need to discuss all aspects of the project before closing a contract. Changes in pre-contractual negotiations were to decrease post-contractual renegotiations and to improve mutual commitment. With the Competitive <b>Dialogue</b> <b>procedure,</b> a public procurement method that was introduced in 2004, this need was met. Yet, the procedure is not proven effective. This dissertation addresses the question how inter-organisational negotiations and commitments are interrelated, and what the effect is of using the competitive <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure.</b> Based on a survey, a multiple-case study and an in-depth single case study, the author shows that understanding is the most important determinant for the development of negotiations and commitments in inter-organisational projects. Investment in creation of mutual understanding in early stages of project negotiations is likely to prevent renegotiations in later stages. The competitive dialogue could have a positive influence on the creation of mutual understanding, yet the research shows how several mechanisms of the procedure are currently counterproductive in realising that. The author proposes several measures to realise a more effective use of the competitive <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{competitive}} dialogue is a procedure used by Rijkswaterstaat {{to obtain the}} most economically -effective contract available for ‘particularly complex’ projects. The procedure entails a dialogue, which may be phased, {{with the aim of}} developing one or more suitable alternatives capable of meeting its requirements. Due to changing legislation several issues will influence the policy for the application of the {{competitive dialogue}}. This changing legislation {{takes the form of a}} proposal for a new Directive on public procurement by the European Commission and a new Dutch procurement law. This anticipatory research poses the question: To what extent is the competitive dialogue implementable in an economically viable manner? To answer this question the research analyses the aforementioned changing legislation. In addition, the current policy of Rijkswaterstaat is reviewed and a cross comparison with the new legislation is performed to see what policy adjustments must be made. The research finds several chances for improvement on the implementation of the competitive <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure.</b> These chances are translated into scenarios and their effect is analyzed using a Multi Criteria Analysis. Finally, these effects are measured against cases where the competitive dialogue has already been implemented. The report concludes that the competitive <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure</b> is economically viable under the current form of implementation by Rijkswaterstaat because it leads to the expected value on a project’s Critical Success Factors. When the new Dutch procurement law comes into effect the current form of implementation of the competitive <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure</b> remains economically viable because very little policy adjustments are necessary. However, in both the current and upcoming legislation there is room for improving the cost-effectiveness of the procedure by limiting the gold-plating effect, this effect is the addition of burdens by national legislation or policy in contrast to the minimum demands stemming from European guidelines.

40|$|Growing {{concerns}} regarding sustainability {{have led the}} construction sector to adopt various policy instruments for reducing the impacts caused by construction activities. One such policy instrument includes impact assessment, which enables the construction sector to evaluate the environmental consequences of proposed developments at project (environmental impact assessment) and strategic (strategic environmental assessment) level. In recent years, the construction sector has also adopted green public procurement, which is a process whereby contracting authorities aim to procure services and products that meet environmental requirements. In certain contexts, green public procurement has extended to sustainable public procurement, which involves the incorporation of both environmental and social considerations in the procurement of services and products. Promoting sustainability in the constructor sector is a significant challenge. This challenge is primarily due to the requirement of high levels of cooperation among project stakeholders, on the one hand, {{and a lack of}} coordination between project planning and implementation on the other hand. Therefore, procurement plays a significant role as it establishes the tone for the interaction between contracting authorities and contractors. The overall aim of this thesis is to bolster the knowledge of promoting sustainability in the construction sector, with the specific aim of analysing the ways in which policy instruments such as environmental impact assessment and green public procurement can be reinforced to improve the coordination between planning and the implementation of sustainability considerations. This thesis conceptualises an inter-link between impact assessment and green public procurement, and identifies the opportunities to develop the inter-link. It is appropriate to plan for green public procurement at the pre-decision phase of an environmental impact assessment. The inter-link can be strengthened by involving contractors in planning for green and sustainable public procurement. One way to involve contractors is with the aid of competitive <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure,</b> which is a procurement procedure that allows contracting authorities to hold discussions with contractors regarding the authority’s requirements. This study strengthens the conceptualisation that competitive <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure</b> can facilitate green and sustainable public procurement. The various elements in a competitive <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure</b> can enable the contracting authorities to ensure the consistency between the weight for environmental considerations in contract award criteria and the relevant preferences. This thesis also discusses key concerns for progress towards sustainable public procurement, which includes among others the incorporation of sustainability values in procurement decisions. In addition, this study identified certain discourses on future trends for green and sustainable public procurement. The discourses provide an opportunity for reflection, and thereby indicate that analytical support is required to develop criteria in a way that enables the evaluation of sustainable public procurement against the background of sustainability and justice regarding natural capital. Innovation must be promoted with a focus on sustainability values. Moreover, green or sustainable public procurement must be discussed between contracting authorities and contractors in light of its contribution to sustainability. QC 20140509 </p...|$|E

The CCITT-MML (man-machine language) is intended to handle the functions required to manage telecommunication systems, e. g. via a telecommunication management network (TMN) (see Recommendation M. 30). The man-machine interface (MMI) enables the exchange of information between users and systems encoded in MML. Interaction between the users and the controlled systems is based on a repertoire of inputs, outputs, special actions and man-machine interaction mechanisms, including <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedures.</b> This Recommendation deals with the specification and control of maintenance functions.

5000|$|The Instrumental Dimension of learning, as a {{principle}} of dialogic learning, {{should not be confused}} with instrumentality or the technocratic colonization of learning. In dialogic learning, as in Habermas (1984), the instrumental and communicative rationality are not opposed to each other, but instrumental learning becomes more intense and profound when situated in an adequate dialogical framework. The ability to select and process information is the cognitive tool that best enables one to function confidently in today's society. Dialogue and reflection encourage the development of that ability. Relationships with other people put not only diverse information but also its selection and processing at our disposal(Flecha, 2000, p. 16). In addition, [...] "when dialogue is egalitarian, it encourages intense reflection, since people need to understand other positions and express their own" [...] (Flecha, 2000, p. 16).

40|$|The {{competitive}} <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure</b> is a {{new public}} procurement award procedure first introduced by the Directive 2004118 for the tender of particularly complex contracts, when contracting authorities consider {{that the use of}} the open or restricted procedures do not allow for the contract to be tendered. It is not intended to be adopted freely as the open or restricted procedures, but contracting authorities may use it only when the need arises and specific grounds for its use are fulfilled. The procedure was introduced with the stated objective of increasing the flexibility of procurement, which had been already identified as a shortcoming of previous existing EU procurement framework. This thesis studies how the competitive dialogue has been implemented in Portugal and Spain. It covers both the legal transposition and aspects of its practice in these countries., through the use of empirical research methods. Through his research, the author has found that the procedure was implemented very differently in Portugal and Spain with consequences on its use. This study has tried to highlight similarities and differences in the transposition, illustrate how the competitive dialogue is being used in Spain and explain why it is being used only sparingly in Portugal.

40|$|Proposals {{for social}} {{regulation}} {{at the level}} of the European Community have proved highly controversial. The Protocol and Agreement on Social Policy (SPA), agreed at Maastricht, provide the potential for a more expansive framework of Community social regulation by setting out wider express legal bases for social action than were previously available in the EC Treaty. The SPA also introduces into the decision making process an extended role for the representatives of management and labour, the "social partners" both in the creation and implementation of social regulation. This "social dialogue" process allows regulation to take the form either of legislation or collective agreements. The SPA applies to 14 of the 15 Member States, excluding the UK, whose Conservative Government remain staunchly opposed to increases in social regulation. This thesis aims to consider the impact of the introduction of the social dialogue process on the creation of European social regulation. After an assessment of the background to the social dialogue, the new decision making process is examined in detail. Consideration is given to the scope of the new legal bases, the practical difficulties inherent within the consultation and negotiation processes and the possibilities for the adoption of European level collective agreements. The thesis then turns to a theoretical assessment of the social dialogue in the light of the European Community's commitments to subsidiarity and democracy. The main conclusion drawn is that the SPA social dialogue has created the potential for the autonomous development of European collective labour law. However, a combination of the present inefficiencies of the social <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure</b> and the personalities involved in the dialogue make the fulfilment of this potential unlikely in the near future...|$|E

40|$|Fatigue is an {{individual}} and subjective sensation interfering with daily living for patients with several chronic conditions. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is characterized by inflammation in different organs combined with immunological abnormalities. The complexity of the disease SLE has several consequences for daily living, and fatigue is among {{one of the most}} burdensome symptoms of SLE. The impact of fatigue in a person’s life is difficult for others to understand. Therefore, to better understand the enigma of fatigue, how fatigue can be measured and patient’s descriptions of how fatigue is experienced are necessary. Aim: The overall aim of this cohort-based project, was to explore patients experiences of symptoms related to SLE with a main focus on fatigue, how it is described and measured. Subjects: 327 patients from the SLE-cohort at Karolinska University Hospital, Solna, and 311 age- and gender- matched control persons contributed to the data. Both qualitative and quantitative data have been used, with interview material from focus group discussions (study I), free-written answers (study II) and self-assessments measures/questionnaires (study II+III+IV). Results: In study I, women (n= 33) in seven focus group discussions (FGD) described their experience of SLE-related fatigue; how they perceived the feeling of fatigue, impact on life and strategies developed to manage fatigue in daily living. Transcripts from the FGD were analyzed using content analysis. The results were presented as four themes where the “Nature of fatigue” involved the sensation, occurrence and character of fatigue, “Aspects affected by fatigue” described emotions that arose with fatigue as well as aspects of work, family life, social contacts, and leisure activities that were affected by SLE related fatigue; “Striving towards power and control” described a balance of strategies used to manage daily life and were categorized into mental struggle, structure, restrict, and provide; “Factors influencing the perception of fatigue” described understanding from surrounding persons and the pain as strongly influencing the experience and perception of fatigue. The result from the open questions in study II (n= 324), showed that fatigue and pain were reported as most troublesome symptoms of SLE, followed by musculoskeletal symptoms. In study III (n= 51) in groups of 6 - 9 patients patents filled in seven questionnaires about fatigue; Numeric rating scale (NRS), Chalder fatigue scale, Vitality from SF- 36, Fatigue Severity Scale, Multi-dimensional Assessment of Fatigue, Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory and Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy – Fatigue. This followed by a <b>dialogue</b> <b>procedure</b> resulting in 260 contrasting assessment. The minimally clinically important difference for the seven measures of fatigue was calculated using the comparative assessment as anchor. All measures of fatigue used in the study seemed to capture differences as experienced by the group of patients themselves, least favorable was however the one question (NRS) this were strengthen by patients free written comments. In study IV (n= 305 patients and 311 controls) three clusters of fatigue were identified. The High fatigue cluster (n = 221) had most symptoms of anxiety/depression, lowest health related quality of life and were dominated by the patients (80 %). Participants in the Low fatigue cluster (n = 240, controls 78 %) reported more physical exercise and less smoking than the other clusters. Conclusion: Patients description of SLE related fatigue (study I) provide important knowledge {{that can be used in}} educational discussions with patients as well as health care workers. The recommended measures of fatigue, evaluated in this thesis, can detect clinically important differences as perceived by the patients (study III). Not all patients with SLE experienced distress from current illness, 10 % reported that they did not perceive any SLE related symptom (study II) and 17 % had low levels of fatigue and healthy behavior (physical exercise, non-smoker) (study IV). With special focus on fatigue, this thesis contributes to the understanding of patients’ experience of SLE. Knowledge of the experience of symptoms from the patients’ perspective is pivotal in order to support the patient, facilitate assessment and choice of treatment as well as generate a base for appropriate intervention programs...|$|E

The methods and the models of the systems’ theory and the system analysis, including methods and automated procedures for structuring organizational aims, models and automated procedures for organizing complex expertise. On the basis of the analysis of existing studies in the field of curriculum modeling, using formal mathematical language, including optimization models, that help to make distribution of disciplines by years and semesters in accordance with the relevant restrictions, it is shown, that the complexity and dimension of these tasks require the development of special software; the problem of defining the input data and restrictions requires a large time investment, that seems to be difficult to provide in real conditions of plans’ developing, thus it is almost impossible to verify the objectivity of the input data and the restrictions in such models. For a complete analysis of the process of curriculum development it is proposed to use the system definition, based on the system-targeted approach. On the basis of this definition the reasonable sequence of the integrated stages for the development of the curriculum was justified: 1) definition (specification) of the requirements for the educational content; 2) determining the number of subjects, included in the curriculum; 3) definition of the sequence of the subjects; 4) distribution of subjects by semesters. The models and technologies for the implementation of these stages of curriculum development were given in the article: 1) models, based on the information approach of A. Denisov and the modified degree of compliance with objectives based on Denisov’s evaluation index (in the article the idea of evaluating the degree of the impact of disciplines for realization of competences was used); 2) models to define the sequence of subjects from curriculum: a) the models, based on evaluating the relationship between the disciplines, using simplicial complex theory, b) the models, implemented by means of information search, using the information retrieval language with the grammar, containing the system of predicates.

In {{this article we}} examine the CD procedures of four complex Dutch road infrastructure projects and explore how the mix in public-private interaction between the three governance strategies of cooperation, competition, and coordination is conditioned by various external influences. We found that public authorities' strict legal coordination can structure the CD process, but may divert attention from the required interaction on project-specific complexities. Combined with private contractors' focus on competition, this does not stimulate public-private cooperation. We conclude that CD is a promising tool for facilitating public-private interaction, but, in practice, the optimal mix of governance strategies is not achieved. We recommend strengthening cooperation by encouraging public and private tender organizations to collaboratively search for opportunities to deal with complexity in planning. ...|$|R

AutoTutor [5, 7], one of the prevalent systems in this field, claims to simulate naturalistic tutoring sessions in the domain of computer literacy. An innovative characteristic of AutoTutor is the use of a talking head as the primary interface with the user. The system is also claimed to be domain independent and to be capable of supporting deep reasoning in the tutorial dialogue. One goal of the current project is to test these claims. Another motivation {{was the fact that the}} domain of AutoTutor, computer literacy, provides limited potential for activating deep reasoning mechanisms. By porting the tutor to a new domain, which requires in-depth qualitative reasoning, we can address issues of domain independence and framework usability in a concrete manner.

Tal procedimento nos possibilitou, por um lado, entrar na perspectiva do outro, e por outro, fazer relações entre cognição, linguagem e cultura para compreendermos as estratégias metacognitivas de alunos da EJA ao se apropriarem da cultura escolar. Pudemos também evidenciar a íntima relação entre fazer e saber e a importância da escola na transição do pensamento concreto para o abstrato e vice-versa...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPublic {{procurement}} of goods, {{services and}} products {{has become a}} cornerstone in recent European policies on innovation. With regard to construction, clients are often promoted as change agents that can foster {{a higher degree of}} innovation in construction through appropriate design of their procurement procedures. With the new European service procurement directive, a number of changes are underway. Among these are less restrictive procedures for using the more flexible procurement forms like competitive dialogue. Based on a literature review and European statistics, this paper will 1) review the historical changes of European procurement rules, 2) quantify the application of competitive <b>dialogue</b> as procurement <b>procedure,</b> and 3) discuss lessons learned from selected European countrieson promoting and managing change in construction through competitive dialogue. This paper will conclude that competitive dialogue seems to have a low potential as driver of innovation in a quantitative sense due to the stable but small number of applications, while the effects on innovation in a qualitative sense needs to be studied further...|$|R

The purpose of the study. The aim {{of the study is}} to base the application of situational control of information security by subsystem of the control and protection of information in automated learning systems and to develop implementation methods of the situational control concept. Materials and methods. It is assumed that the automated learning system is a fragment of a larger information system that contains several information paths, each of them treats different information in the protection degree from information, containing constituting state secrets, to open access information. It is considered that the technical methods, measures and means of information protection in automated learning systems implement less than half (30 %) functions of subsystems of control and protection information. The main part of the functions of this subsystem are organizational measures to protect information. It is obvious that the task of ensuring the security of information in automated learning systems associated with the adoption of decisions on rational selection and proper combination of technical methods and institutional arrangements. Conditions of practical application of automated learning systems change over time and transform the situation of such a decision, and this leads to the use of situational control methods. When situational control is implementing, task of the protection of information in automated learning system is solved by the subsystem control and protection of information by distributing the processes ensuring the security of information and resources of subsystem elements of the automated learning system to meet changing conditions of operation. When the event, associated with the emergence of threats to the information security related to one of the elements of a situation to a variety of destabilizing factors is checked in the system, the formation of the base of alternative control actions sets of situational management is formed, then the sets of the admissible solutions of the situational control options are formed. The best solution provides an extremum of the objective function of situational control of information security. Results. The main {{approaches to}} ensuring the information security in automated learning systems are considered, the necessity of the use of situational control of security in automated learning systems is based, mathematical model and problem statement of situational control are offered, the method of situational control of information protection is developed. Conclusion. Developed method of situational control of information security in automated learning systems, involves the participation of the operator in the development and decision-making (<b>dialogue</b> <b>procedures</b> statement of objectives situational control, the formation of the base of alternative sets of control actions, etc.). Another important feature of this technique is the necessity of using previously developed models (models of decision-making situation, a model of coordination and planning of operation of a subsystem of the control and protection of information, models of information processing about the status of the subsystem analysis models and evaluation of results) and the database obtained on the basis of operating experience of information protection systems in the automated learning systems. The implementation of the concept of situational control of information security ensures the timely adaptation of the algorithms and parameters of the information security system to changes in the external environment and the nature of tasks within the education systems and on this basis allows to improve the characteristics of the information protection system in the automated learning systems. </p...|$|R
