He signed Lincoln City winger John McGinley and Leeds midfielder John Stiles, and led the club to a 20th-place finish in 1989–90, which {{represented}} a small <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> the previous season.

5|$|In {{reviews of}} the Amstrad release, Amtix noted the colour {{additions}} over the monochromatic original and wrote that Knight Lore was among the Amstrad's best adventures.

In the US, it sold 47,726copies in its first week of release and entered the Billboard 200 at number twelve, a marked <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> predecessor Silent Alarm which had only made number114 when it was released in 2005. The album also topped the Billboard Top Independent Albums. According to Nielsen SoundScan, it had sold 148,000copies in the US by August 2008. More than one million copies have been sold worldwide.|$|E
5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine {{was brought in}} to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as he believed the additions made were not an <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, MD410 was {{extended}} even further east and saw significant <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> its extant sections.

In addition, the pre-1946 course saw completion of efforts to widen the road to 40 feet. The highway between Connecticut Avenue (then MD193) and Georgia Avenue (US29) was widened in 1946 and 1947. The two segments between Wisconsin Avenue (US 240) and Connecticut Avenue (MD193) and between MD650 in Takoma Park and US1 in Hyattsville were widened in 1950.|$|E

5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic {{framework}} of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are free in the intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–08 season, West Ham {{remained}} reasonably consistently in the {{top half}} of the league table, with Fredrik Ljungberg in the team, despite a slew of injuries; new signing Craig Bellamy missed most of the campaign, while Kieron Dyer was out from August 2007. The last game of the season, at the Boleyn Ground, saw West Ham draw 2–2 against Aston Villa, ensuring a tenth-place finish three points ahead of rivals Tottenham Hotspur. It was a five-place <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> the previous season, and most importantly West Ham were never under any realistic threat of relegation.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{considered}} Viva Piñata {{a success}} and the sequel's development team sought to make a more definitive version of the original. The team re-used many of the development infrastructure set up for its predecessor and exhausted their gameplay ideas for the piñata gardening concept. The game released to generally favorable reviews in September 2008. Critics considered the game more accessible to newcomers and a worthwhile <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> the original, but altogether closer to an expansion than a unique sequel. Reviewers praised its game design tweaks but were mixed on its multiplayer modes and camera integration. Critics were mixed on whether the sequel would attract new players to the franchise. Trouble in Paradise was later included in the developer's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E

The shower, which {{featured a}} plastic curtain and fan to collect water via an airflow, was later converted into a steam room; it eventually had its plumbing removed and the space was reused. When the shower was unavailable, crew members washed using wet wipes, with soap dispensed from a toothpaste tube-like container, or using a washbasin equipped with a plastic hood, located in the core module. Crews were also provided with rinse-less shampoo and edible toothpaste to save water.|$|E
5|$|One of Chapman's first {{decisions}} was {{to bring}} in Sunderland striker Charlie Buchan, recognising Arsenal's lack of goal threat. Arsenal finished second in Chapman's first season, a marked <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> previous seasons, though finished no higher as the 1920s drew to a close. Chapman continued to reshape his team and buy players to fit his desired system. He led Arsenal to their first major trophy, as they beat his former side Huddersfield Town 2–0 in the 1930 FA Cup Final. The team continued to mature and won the 1930–31 First Division title, scoring 127 goals in the process. Chapman won another championship in 1932–33, after Arsenal ended the previous season as league and 1932 FA Cup runners-up.|$|E
5|$|Paltrow's guest {{appearance}} attracted positive commentary, but the episode's sub-plots {{were less}} well received. Aly Semigran of MTV, Robert Canning of IGN and Entertainment Weekly Tim Stack all deemed the episode {{one of the}} best of the season. Time James Poniewozik felt that it was a relatively subdued, mediocre episode, and Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club found it to be an <b>improvement</b> <b>on</b> the previous two episodes, if not genuinely good. The National Alliance on Mental Illness criticized the episode for its depiction of bipolar disorder. Paltrow won the 2011 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for her performance.|$|E
