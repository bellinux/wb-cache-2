40|$|International audienceAfrican trypanosomes are flagellated {{protozoan}} parasites {{responsible for}} sleeping sickness and transmitted by tsetse flies. The accomplishment of their parasite cycle requires adaptation to highly diverse environments. These transitions {{take place in}} a strictly defined order and are accompanied by spectacular morphological modifications in cell size, shape and positioning of organelles. To understand the molecular bases of these processes, parasites isolated from different tissues of the tsetse fly were analysed by immunofluorescence with markers for specific cytoskeleton components and by a new immunofluorescence-based assay for evaluation of the cell volume. The data revealed striking differences between proliferative stages found in the midgut or in the salivary glands and the <b>differentiating</b> <b>stage</b> occurring in the proventriculus. Cell proliferation was characterized by a significant increase in cell volume, by a pronounced cell elongation marked by microtubule extension at the posterior end, and by the production of a new flagellum similar to the existing one.

40|$|SummaryThe {{generation}} of in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells from in vitro differentiating {{embryonic stem cells}} has remained a long-standing challenge. To date, hematopoietic engraftment has mostly been achieved through the enforced expression of ectopic transcription factors. Here, we describe serum-free culture conditions that allow the {{generation of}} in vivo repopulating hematopoietic cells {{in the absence of}} ectopically expressed factors. We show that repopulating activity arises immediately upon the commitment of mesodermal precursors to the blood program, within the first wave of hematopoietic specification. We establish that the formation of these progenitors is extremely transient and exquisitely sensitive to the cytokine milieu. Our findings define the precise <b>differentiating</b> <b>stage</b> at which hematopoietic repopulating activity first appears in vitro, and suggest that during embryonic stem cell differentiation, all hematopoietic programs are unraveled simultaneously from the mesoderm in the absence of cues that restrict the coordinated emergence of each lineage as is normally observed during embryogenesis...|$|E

The goal {{of our study}} was to compare these systems in patients undergoing surgery for non–small cell lung cancer to determine whether one system is superior in staging operable disease. MethodsPathologic stages in 1154 patients undergoing complete resection over a 9 -year period were analyzed. Patients were assigned a stage based on both IASLC and UICC- 6 systems. We tested for statistically meaningful {{differences between the two}} staging systems using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and the permutation test. ResultsThe IASLC system is more effective than the UICC- 6 system at ordering and differentiating patients (P =. 009). Application of the IASLC system resulted in 202 (17. 5 %) patients being reassigned to a different stage (P =. 012), with the most common shifts occurring from IB to IIA and IIIB to IIIA. The 5 -year and median survivals of the IASLC IIIA patients including those shifted from the UICC- 6 IIIB were 37 % and 35 months, respectively. Reclassifying UICC- 6 IIIB to IASLC IIIA did not reduce survival for the newly characterized IIIA cohort. ConclusionOur data confirm that the proposed IASLC staging system is more effective at <b>differentiating</b> <b>stage</b> than the UICC- 6 system.

Semi-quantitative PCR indicated mRNA expression of islet development markers (nestin, Pdx 1, Nkx 6. 1, Oct 4), mature pancreatic beta-cell markers (insulin, glucagon, Glut 2, Sur 1, Kir 6. 1) and the GIP receptor gene GIP-R in undifferentiated (stage 1) cells, with increasing levels in <b>differentiated</b> <b>stages</b> 4 and 5.

To investigate how they originate from these specific regions, he established an explant culture system of embryonic days 12 (E 12) mouse cervical spinal cord and hindbrain, named flat whole-mount preparation. Alpha subunit of the receptor for platelet derived growth factor (PDGFR α) mRNA-expressing cells, which are the major progenitors of oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord, were first detected in the ventral half of the explant near the ventral midline of the cervical spinal cord, and subsequently distributed dorsally When he cultured the ventral and dorsal cord separately, a robust {{increase in the number}} of PDGFRα positive cells was observed in the ventral fragment of the cervical spinal cord. The number of proliferating cells, mainly Musashi positive neuroepithelial cells increased in the ventral fragment, suggesting that factors from the dorsal spinal cord inhibit a step switching the cells from proliferating stage to <b>differentiating</b> <b>stage.</b> The increase in numbers of immature and mature oligodendrocytes in the ventral fragment suggests that these factors also inhibit oligodendrocyte maturation. Bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP 4), a strong candidate for this factor, which is secreted from the dorsal spinal cord, did not affect oligodendrocyte development. Previous studies demonstrated that signals from notochord and the ventral spinal cord, such as sonic hedgehog and neuregulin, promote the ventral region specific development of oligodendrocytes. His present study showed that the dorsal spinal cord negatively regulate oligodendrocyte development.

40|$|Epithelial {{ovarian cancer}} {{accounts}} for 5 % of all cancer deaths and greater than 50 % of all gynaecological cancer deaths. It presents at a late clinical stage {{in more than}} 60 % of patients, and {{is associated with a}} 5 -year survival of only 30 % in this group. In contrast, the 5 -year survival for patients with organ-confined stage I ovarian cancer exceeds 90 %, and most patients are cured of their disease. Thus, the detection of early stage ovarian cancer {{is the best way to}} improve survival. No clinically applicable method exists for the early detection of ovarian cancer. Hence, there is an unmet medical need for an accurate screening test. Most scientific efforts towards early detection are focused on the discovery of tumour-associated antigens (TAA). Autologous antibodies against TAAs, however, may serve as more sensitive diagnostic markers. They circulate in the blood before TAAs and are usually more abundant than the TAAs themselves as a result of amplification through the humoral immune response. Accumulating evidence also suggests that a humoral response already exists during malignant transformation when aberrant gene expression is translated into premalignant cellular changes. In this thesis, potential autoantibody biomarkers for ovarian cancer were discovered, verified and validated as an early detection test. A new immunoproteomic strategy was developed to identify novel autoantibodies that were elevated in serous ovarian cancer patients. Lysate extracted from the ovarian tissue of a patient was applied to an immunoaffinity column generated with autologous antibodies and a paired control immunoaffinity column. Relative quantification of captured autoantigens was performed using isotope coded protein label (ICPL) technology coupled with high resolution LC-MS. At a protein ratio cut-off of 1. 45 -fold, 148 autoantibodies were found to be enriched in ovarian cancer patients compared to the corresponding controls. Upon bioinformatic prioritisation 50 autoantibody candidates were selected for verification. Protein microarray analysis of 98 samples revealed 9 autoantibody candidates to be significantly different in early stage cancer patients compared to healthy and benign controls. Biomarker candidates anti-ANXA 1, anti-SAHH and anti-ARP 3 showed the greatest potential where each marker achieved greater than 90 % specificity at 83. 3 % sensitivity. As a 4 -biomarker panel with the ‘gold standard’ for ovarian cancer detection, cancer antigen (CA) 125, a sensitivity of 76. 5 % at 100 % specificity was attained. These values of sensitivity and specificity for early stage ovarian cancer surpassed the minimum requirements for an implementable screening test and showed great promise as a diagnostic tool. Validation of the top three autoantibody candidates using protein microarray revealed anti-ANXA 1 to be the most robust and effective biomarker for stage I cancer detection. As a single biomarker anti-ANXA 1 had 81. 8 % sensitivity and 71. 9 % specificity for stage I cancer compared to healthy and benign controls. Excitingly, in combination with CA 125, a sensitivity of 71. 4 % at 100 % specificity was achieved when <b>differentiating</b> <b>stage</b> I cancer patients from healthy individuals. For this level of effectiveness a positive and negative predictive value of 100 % and 99. 99 % was achieved, respectively. Therefore, a biomarker panel containing anti-ANXA 1 and CA 125 may enable the development of a detection test that can be used to screen for stage I serous ovarian cancer in the general population. This promising discovery demands further investigation where continuing analysis in prospective samples is essential. The discovery of a screening test is crucial to reduce the morbidity and mortality caused by ovarian cancer. This study investigates the presence of differential autoantibody signatures in serous ovarian cancer patients as potential biomarkers. Additionally, those identified TAAs that are functionally involved in carcinogenesis could also serve as therapeutic targets. Finally, the immunoproteomic approach developed here could be used in studies aiming to discover novel autoantibody biomarkers for other asymptomatic malignancies. Thesis (Ph. D.)

It {{has been suggested}} that symptomatic smokers with normal FEV 1 /FVC (Stage 0 COPD, GOLD criteria) can develop COPD in the future. Potential early biomarkers in COPD include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). It is not yet known, whether alterations in MMP expression are associated with smoking alone or with the risk of developing COPD. In this cross-sectional study MMP- 8, MMP- 9 and MMP- 12 were determined from induced sputum and plasma by ELISA, immunocytochemistry, zymography, and/or Western blot in non-smokers (n = 32), smokers with symptoms (Stage 0, GOLD criteria) (n = 23) or without symptoms (n = 23). Only MMP- 8 <b>differentiated</b> <b>Stage</b> 0 COPD from non-symptomatic smokers (p = 0. 02). MMP- 9 levels were significantly elevated in the induced sputum of non-symptomatic smokers and Stage 0 COPD (p = 0. 01, p < 0. 001) compared to non-smokers, but did not differ between the two subgroups of smokers. MMP- 12 was higher only at Stage 0 compared to non-smokers (p = 0. 04). MMP- 8, MMP- 9 and MMP- 12 immunoreactivity was localized in macrophages and neutrophils, especially in smokers. MMP- 8 levels correlated significantly with the small airway flow parameters (MEF 50, MEF 25) (p = 0. 005 and p = 0. 0004) and markers of neutrophil activation (myeloperoxidase, lactoferrin).

Exposure with rapamycin enhanced the cytotoxicity of NK cells by upregulating the expression of IL- 27 in UECC and IL- 27 receptors (IL- 27 Rs: WSX- 1 and gp 130) on NK cells and further restricted the growth of UEC in Ishikawa-xenografted nude mice. In addition, treatment with rapamycin resulted in an increased autophagy level of UECC, and IL- 27 enhanced this ability of rapamycin. Cisplatin-mediated NK cells' cytotoxic activity and anti-UEC activation were independent of IL- 27; however, the combination of rapamycin and cisplatin led to a higher cytotoxic activity of NK cells, smaller UEC volume and longer survival rate in vivo. These results suggest that rapamycin and cisplatin synergistically activate the cytotoxicity of NK cells and inhibit the progression of UEC in both an IL- 27 –dependent and –independent manner. This provides a scientific basis for potential rapamycin-cisplatin combined therapeutic strategies targeted to UEC, especially for the patients with low <b>differentiated</b> <b>stage</b> or abnormally low level of IL- 27...|$|R
