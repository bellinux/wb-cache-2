5|$|The {{band has}} also seen musicians such as Keith Morris and Chuck Biscuits briefly {{fill in for}} a show or two. Morris, who was {{fronting}} the Circle Jerks at the time, filled in for Kiedis for a show in 1986.

25|$|One of {{his star}} {{students}} was Rabbi Shlomo Wahrman, a tremendous Torah scholar {{who came from}} Leipzig for fifteen years {{and went on to}} becoming principal and Rosh Yeshiva of the Hebrew Academy of Nassau County. Rabbi Wahrman attributes his success to Rabbi Silver’s insistence and encouragement to hone his writing skills and record his copious chidushei Torah. Rabbi Wahrman writes in the short biography he published on Rabbi Silver:I remember at times <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> at me for lack of understanding-however, even then I sensed his great love and concern for me and not the slightest hint of hatred. Rabbi Silver was a man whose very essence was giving to others-his ahavas yisroel (love for his fellow Jew) knew no bounds…he saw every Jew as an extension of himself.|$|E
25|$|Horton's article {{includes}} an account by Shaker Aamer, a detainee and legal resident of Britain. His lawyer, Zachary Katznelson, had filed an affidavit {{in federal court}} in which Aamer said that he had been taken to the black site on 9 June 2006, where he was beaten and nearly asphyxiated. This was the same evening that the three prisoners died. Aamer said that during his interrogation, he was strapped to a chair, fully restrained at the head, arms and legs. MPs pressed on pressure points all over his body. They also inflicted pain to his eyes, bent his fingers until <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> and then pressed against his throat and put a mask over him so he could not cry out. He said he could hardly breathe. Although Aamer was cleared for repatriation to Britain in 2009, as of 2015 he is still detained at Guantanamo, where he has been held for almost 15 years without charge or trial. He is the last British resident to be held there.|$|E

25|$|In 1938, {{champion}} Joe Louis {{announced that}} he would face Schmeling for the title. The rematch became an instant international sensation. Many clamored impatiently for its happening, but others, afraid of international tensions and the possibility of Hitler taking over the championship, protested. The controversy and ballyhoo led to the event becoming the most anticipated boxing match since the rematch between Dempsey and Gene Tunney, or possibly earlier. Louis, with his poor, black roots was adopted by American fans as the symbol of America as a land of opportunity. In contrast, Americans perceived Schmeling and his ties to Hitler as an obvious threat to those opportunities and ideals. When the German walked to the ring at Yankee Stadium on 22 June 1938, he did so under a hail of garbage thrown from the stands. Louis came out blazing in the first round and Schmeling tried to counter-punch as he had in the first bout, but to no avail. Driven into the ropes and battered with a fusillade of short, crisp blows from every angle, Schmeling turned his back to his opponent and clutched onto the ropes, letting out a scream that even years later, many spectators could recall vividly. Schmeling later said that <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> because he had been hit with a blow to the kidneys. Schmeling's knees buckled under the punishment, and referee Arthur Donovan pushed Louis away, beginning a count on Schmeling. Schmeling reluctantly stepped away from the ropes, and Donovan allowed him to continue. A few punches later, Schmeling was knocked down again. From then on, he was helpless. He rose but fell moments later, and Donovan stopped the fight.|$|E

500|$|The grunge singing {{style was}} similar to the [...] "outburst" [...] of loud, heavily {{distorted}} electric guitar in tone and delivery; Kurt Cobain used a [...] "gruff, slurred articulation and gritty timbre" [...] and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam made use of a [...] "wide, powerful vibrato" [...] to show his [...] "depth of expression." [...] In general, grunge singers used a [...] "deeper vocal style" [...] which matched the lower-sounding, downtuned guitars and the darker-themed lyrical messages used in the style. Grunge singers used [...] "gravelly, raspy" [...] vocals, [...] "...growls, moans, screams and mumbles" [...] and [...] "plaintive groans"; this range of singing styles was used to communicate the [...] "varied emotions" [...] of the lyrics. Cobain’s reaction to the [...] "bad times" [...] and discontent of the era was that <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> his lyrics. In general, grunge songs were sung [...] "simply, often somewhat unintelligibly"; the virtuoso [...] "operatics of hair-metal were shunned."

500|$|Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957 {{when they}} were fellow {{students}} at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, <b>he</b> <b>screamed</b> out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace." ...|$|E

2500|$|Another {{example of}} an alleged {{prediction}} coded {{in the text of}} the Bible, which is also attributed to Rabbi Chaim Michael Dov Weissmandl (who was mentioned above), concerns the hanging of 10 Nazi leaders on October 16, 1946 following the Nuremberg Trials (The first trial involved 23 of the most important political and military leaders of the Third Reich, of the 12 defendants sentenced to death by hanging, 10 were hanged). Rabbi Weissmandl claimed that this event was predicted by the Biblical story about the hanging of the 10 sons of Haman (Esther 9), also as a final consequence of a (failed) genocidal plan against the Jews. The [...] "coded" [...] aspect of his speculation is that in the Masoretic text of the Bible, three letters within the list of Haman's sons are marked as small letters: the tav [...] of Parshandatha, the shin [...] of Parmashtha and the zayin [...] of Vajezatha. Rabbi Weissmandl pointed out that if you combine the three small letters together they form the word , which in the accepted Hebrew notation for year numbers (using Gematria) corresponds to the Jewish year 707 Anno Mundi, which is the Jewish year that the 10 Nazi leaders were executed (October 16, 1946 corresponds to Tishrei 21, 5707, the day known as Hoshanna Rabba, the day of severe judgments for the nations of the world, according to the Jewish calendar). Additionally, while Julius Streicher stood on the platform about to be hanged, <b>he</b> <b>screamed,</b> 'Purim Fest 1946.' Many people criticize various aspects of this speculation. They point out that there are several different traditions about what are the small letters in the names of Haman's sons. Also they point out that the proponents only mention the similarities between the cases, but ignore the many differences. More in general they point out that this is not exactly an a priori prediction, but rather a postdiction, and therefore the statistical significance of it, if there is any at all, cannot be reliably calculated.|$|E
