5|$|A man {{was sent}} to New York to receive payment for the stock, but Grey had {{forgotten}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> stopped at Martha's Vineyard. Colonel Beriah Norton made two special trips to London for the same purpose, and at one time {{he was given a}} hearing in Parliament. Very little was accomplished in these two trips to England.|$|E

Later that season he ranked him second, slightly behind St. Simon. Henry Chaplin, the owner of Hermit, called Ladas the finest horse he had seen.|$|E
5|$|Just as in Q1, the two Mercedes cars set {{the fastest}} times in Q2 as well. Verstappen {{was unable to}} {{continue}} and therefore only four of the running cars were to be eliminated. Those were Hülkenberg, the second Toro Rosso of Sainz, Pastor Maldonado and Fernando Alonso, who said his lap was likely the best <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> driven at the circuit.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the final}} decision, both {{the board and}} Carl Larsson knew that the {{minister}} of religious affairs was favourable towards the new painting. However, {{a majority of the}} board, including the former director Looström and his successor Richard Bergh, was against it, and only two were in favour. Instead, the board asked Larsson to make a different painting. Larsson did not answer initially, but he declared in the press that he still considered Midvinterblot to be among the greatest and most beautiful works <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> made.|$|E

5|$|Clark, Ford, and Jennings {{were among}} {{a total of}} more than 1,000 members of the ABC News {{division}} that were part of the broadcast. They were all under the direction of ABC's Roger Goodman. The ABC 2000 Today telecast overall also received a Peabody Award. Reflecting on the event, Clark was enthusiastic about his participation, feeling that New Year's Eve 2000 {{was one of the biggest}} nights <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> spent in Times Square.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{publicity}} and billing {{this was only}} McKay's fifth prize-fight. Since his defeat {{at the hands of}} Byrne two-and-half years earlier McKay had fought and won just three matches, earning him £180, while Byrne had earned £200. Both men were promised £200 for the match whatever its outcome. McKay had earned £100 for his previous fight against Paul Spencer, the most <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> received; the promised payment was a huge improvement in his fortunes.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, the {{defendant}} Wiens appeared reserved but was noted for extreme statements. He said that Muslims were monsters {{to him and}} asked the court why they were not deported after the 9/11 attacks. He stated that German people should not mingle with foreigners and declared that he would vote for the far right National Democratic Party of Germany. The judge then requested a verbatim record, while the defence counsel tried to mediate. Wiens continued in this fashion, prompting the judge to ask whether <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> visited a concentration camp.|$|E

5|$|In January 1566 Sultan Suleiman I {{had ruled}} the Ottoman Empire for 46 years {{and went to}} war for the last time. He was 72 years old and, {{although}} having gout {{to the extent that}} he was carried on a litter, he nominally commanded his thirteenth military campaign. On 1 May 1566 the Sultan left Constantinople at the head of one of the largest armies <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> commanded.|$|E
5|$|King was {{influential}} in deciding who would play Flagg {{in the television}} adaptation of The Stand. He felt {{he was the best}} villain <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> created, and wanted the actor playing him to be right for the part. Director Mick Garris and the studios wanted to give the role to an established star such as Christopher Walken, James Woods, Willem Dafoe or Jeff Goldblum. King himself had suggested Robert Duvall in his introduction to the novel. Miguel Ferrer, who played Flagg's henchman in the film, was interested in playing the villain.|$|E
5|$|The A320 {{retained}} the dark cockpit where an indicator is off when its system is running {{to draw attention}} on dysfunctions from the A310, the first widebody designed to be operated without a flight engineer and influenced by Bernard Ziegler, first Airbus CEO Henri Ziegler's son. All following Airbuses have similar human/machine interface and systems control philosophy to facilitate cross-type qualification with minimal training; for Roger Béteille, former Airbus president, this choice {{was one of the}} most difficult <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> made.|$|E

5|$|The {{excellence}} of Boult's orchestra attracted leading international conductors. In its second season guest conductors included Richard Strauss, Felix Weingartner and Bruno Walter, followed, in later seasons, by Serge Koussevitzky, Beecham and Willem Mengelberg. Arturo Toscanini, widely regarded {{at the time}} as the world's leading conductor, conducted the BBC orchestra in 1935 and said that it was the finest <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> directed. He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1937, 1938 and 1939.|$|E
5|$|Andrew Dudley was one {{of three}} sons of Edmund Dudley, a {{councillor}} of King Henry VII, and his second wife Elizabeth Grey, daughter of Edward Grey, 4th Viscount Lisle. When he was a toddler, his father was executed by the young Henry VIII as a scapegoat for the former king's financial policies. His eldest brother was John Dudley, later Duke of Northumberland, who sought to advance him in the king's service. Andrew Dudley served in the household of Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, and as an officer of the exchequer in the 1540s. Answering a complaint against exchequer activities in October 1540, Norfolk told the Privy Council that the only two people <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> found jobs for were Andrew Dudley and Edward Belingeham.|$|E
5|$|As a teenager, Hessenthaler {{played for}} the youth team of his local club Dartford. He later joined Fawkham-based amateur team Corinthian, but Charlton Athletic took him on in 1983 on a non-{{contract}} trial basis. He failed to secure {{a contract with the}} club, however, and returned to playing on a part-time basis while working as a builder. In 1986, he was spotted by Dartford manager Peter Taylor while playing in a Kent Senior Cup match. Hessenthaler signed for his hometown club on a wage of £40 per week, the first regular income <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> received for playing.|$|E

5|$|Cinderella teams TnC Gaming and Digital Chaos, {{who were}} both {{projected}} to finish {{near the bottom}} of the final standings, exceeded expectations, with the latter eventually reaching the Grand Finals, finishing as the tournament's runner-up. Game one of the upper bracket series between Evil Geniuses and EHOME was thought by Patrick Hancock of Destructoid to be more exciting than any traditional sporting match <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen, with him comparing moments during the game to famous American football plays such as the Helmet Catch. Seattle KCPQ reporter Kaci Aitchison, who co-hosted the event, thought that due to the International's large prize pools and production values, eSports had become a true spectator sport which deserved the same level of respect of traditional sports.|$|E
5|$|During the 2013 Masters, Woods {{was up for}} {{disqualification}} over {{claims that}} he took an illegal drop on the par-5 15th hole after his third shot had bounced off of the pin and into the water. After further review, Woods was assessed a two-stroke penalty for the drop and was not disqualified. He finished tied for fourth in the event. Woods won The Players Championship in May 2013, his second career win at the event, notching his fourth win of the 2013 season. It was the quickest <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> gotten to four wins in any season in his professional career.|$|E
5|$|Greed premiered on December 4, 1924, at the Cosmopolitan Theatre in Columbus Circle, New York City, {{which was}} owned by William Randolph Hearst. Frank Norris had once worked for Hearst as a foreign {{correspondent}} during the Spanish–American War and Hearst praised Greed, calling it the greatest film <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> seen. Hearst's newspapers promoted the film, but MGM did very little advertising. At {{the time of the}} release von Stroheim was in Los Angeles, having begun production on The Merry Widow on December 1. In May 1926 Greed was released in Berlin, where its premiere famously caused a riot at the theater that may have been instigated by members of the then-fledgling Nazi party.|$|E
