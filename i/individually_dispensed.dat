50|$|Coca-Cola Freestyle is a {{touch screen}} soda {{fountain}} introduced by The Coca-Cola Company in 2009. The machine features 165 different Coca-Cola drink products, {{as well as}} custom flavors. The machine allows users to select from mixtures of flavors of Coca-Cola branded products which are then <b>individually</b> <b>dispensed.</b> The machines are currently located in major Coca-Cola partners and retail locations {{as a part of}} a gradual and ongoing deployment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: <b>Individually</b> <b>dispensed</b> {{droplets}} were dried on a {{flat surface}} to mimic the drying of single droplets during spray drying. A robust dispensing process is presented that generates small droplets (dp> 150 µm). A predictive model based on Bernoulli’s law accurately describes droplet size with varying liquids and dispensing parameters. Shrinkage of the droplets, monitored with a camera, was described using mass balance equations. Finally, a Sherwood correlation was derived to describe the mass transfer coefficient for sessile droplets. This work forms the basis {{for the development of a}} platform for high throughput experimentation on spray drying...|$|E

Respiratory {{health effects of}} exposure to PM and traffic pollutants are well documented, yet {{this is one of}} the first studies to investigate short-term health effects of ambient H 2 S exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between daily ambient levels of H 2 S, PM 10, nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) and ozone (O 3), and the use of drugs for obstructive pulmonary diseases in adults in Iceland's capital area. The study period was 8 March 2006 to 31 December 2009. We used log-linear Poisson generalized additive regression models with cubic splines to estimate relative risks of <b>individually</b> <b>dispensed</b> drugs by air pollution levels. A three-day moving average of the exposure variables gave the best fit to the data. Final models included significant covariates adjusting for climate and influenza epidemics, as well as time-dependent variables. The three-day moving average of H 2 S and PM 10 levels were positively associated with the number of individuals who were dispensed drugs at lag 3 - 5, corresponding to a 2. 0...|$|E
40|$|The {{medication}} errors {{can bring}} serious consequences to patients, professionals andhealthcare institutions, they have multiple causes, amongst them failures related to theprofessionals {{and related to}} the medication system. This studys objective was to identify and toanalyse the medication system process, its failures in order to propose improvement actions to thehospital. This exploratory descriptive study {{took place in the}} medical clinical unit and in thepharmacy of a general and university hospital of the state of Goiás, after approval of theCommittee of the Ethics of the correspondent hospital. The sample included: (first phase) apharmacist, (third phase) 40 professionals divided into 12 resident physicians (30 %), 20 nursingprofessionals (50 %), 8 pharmacy team members (20 %); 294 patient charts were also used. Thedata was collected in 2002 and consisted of an interview with the professional in charge of themedication system, and non-participant observation of the environment and actions of theprofessionals and the academic people, interviews with the professionals and patient chartanalysis. The professionals were asked to sign on the Free Will Participation Agreement. It waspossible based on the data collected to describe the following processes: handwriting medicationprescription using carbon paper, <b>individually</b> dose <b>dispensing</b> and that the nursing professional whoadministrates the drug is not the same that prepares it in the clinical unit. The results based on the 21 days of observation of the drug prescription, dispensing and administration processes were: theenvironment is the main problem in the prescription (75 %) and dispensing (30, 6 %) processes, it isa noisy place and interruptions frequently occur; safety failures during the technique and inadvancedrug preparation appeared in the top (46, 8 %) in the preparation process. The datacollection also allowed to build a chart of the 60 steps from drug prescription to monitoring. Theresults from the interviews showed that the most frequent errors were related to both prescription(29 %) and schedule (20, 6 %) and their main cause were individual failures and lack of attention(47, 7 %) and work overload (14, 5 %). The individual failures were also listed as the main failure inthe medication system (27 %). In order to avoid errors 28, 3 % of the answers suggested to changethe individuals behavior, and orientation as the administrative action more frequently taken (25 %). The patient chart analysis found out the following drug prescriptions characteristics: 64, 6 %readable, 62, 2 % using drug brand names as well as the active principle name, 95 % incomplete formissing information, 96 % using abbreviations and 30 % with erasures. Concerning to drugnotifications, the analysis also found out 7 nursing reports, one from the physician and that there isno error report in the clinical unit. The suggested improvements to avoid errors and enhance thesystem are: computerized physician order electronic entry, unit dose, errors reports, non-punitiveapproach, patient safety, and at last to make the system as simple and lean as possible...|$|R
