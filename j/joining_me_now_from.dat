Look! some of the headmen are waiting to see me." ...|$|R
500|$|Baltimore {{spent the}} last two years of his life {{constantly}} lobbying for his new charter, though the obstacles proved difficult. The Virginians, led by William Claiborne, who sailed to England to make the case, campaigned aggressively against separate colonising of the Chesapeake, claiming they possessed the rights to that area. Baltimore was short of capital, having exhausted his fortune, and was sometimes forced to depend on the assistance of his friends. To make matters worse, in the summer of 1630 his household was infected by the plague, which he survived. He wrote to Wentworth: [...] "Blessed be God for it who hath preserved <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> shipwreck, hunger, scurvy and pestilence..." ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{chronicles the}} author’s journey of writing short stories. Following an opening story, the author {{explains}} how she wrote {{short stories and}} field notes during her study of Head Start policy Initially, the stories captured the author’s emotive and physical memories of mundane and extraordinary events. Later, {{with the help of}} Norman Denzin, the stories became part of a research text. Acknowledging that researchers are encouraged to write experimental texts, the author argues that there are few exemplars in educational research of such work. The author then describes and shows how she combined short stories with connecting text. The connecting text provides historical and cultural background on policies depicted in the story. The article concludes by raising questions about how short stories will be evaluated by qualitative methodologists and other researchers.

60|$|September 6th.--I think I paid my {{last visit}} to the Exhibition, and feel as if I {{had had enough of}} it, {{although}} I have got but {{a small part of the}} profit it might have afforded me. But pictures are certainly quite other things to <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> what they were at my first visit; it seems even as if there were a sort of illumination within them, that makes me see them more distinctly. Speaking of pictures, the miniature of Anne of Cleves is here, on the faith of which Henry VIII. married her; also, the picture of the Infanta of Spain, which Buckingham brought over to Charles I. while Prince of Wales. This has a delicate, rosy prettiness.|$|R

5000|$|Live In Wacken is {{the sixth}} live album by the German hard rock band Bonfire. It was {{released}} in 2013 by LZ Records and Sony Music. The live performances on the album were recorded on two different occasions, in 1998 at Wacken and 2008 in Ingolstadt (the latter recording is indicated as [...] "bonus tracks"). In addition, there are two studio tracks: a re-recording of Domo Arigato from You Make <b>Me</b> Feel <b>now</b> called Thank You and a longer mix of Hold <b>Me</b> <b>Now</b> <b>from</b> Branded. Although Harry Reischmann is creditted for drums, he only performs on the last song on the album. Jurgen [...] "Bam Bam" [...] Wiehler performs the drum portions of the live recordings and on the studio song Thank You. Also, Chris [...] "Yps" [...] Limburg is creditted as the rhythm guitarist for the album, but it is Chris Lausmann whom performs that function for the songs done in Wacken (Songs 1 to 12).|$|R
60|$|I {{returned}} to my lodgings much chagrined, and very disconsolate; for as I had for several years lived {{at the pinnacle of}} splendour and satisfaction, it was a prodigious heart-break to <b>me</b> <b>now</b> to fall <b>from</b> upwards of £3000 per annum to a poor £500 principal.|$|R
60|$|With {{an effort}} I raised {{my eyes and}} looked at her. She stood, tall and gracious, in a ruby splendour of sunset falling through the window beside her. The light quivered like living {{radiance}} over a dark proud head, a white throat, and a face before whose perfect loveliness the memory of Dorothy Armstrong's laughing prettiness faded like {{a star in the}} sunrise, nevermore in the fullness of the day to be remembered. Yet it was not of her beauty I thought as I stood spellbound before her. I seemed to see a dim little valley full of whispering pines, and a girl standing under their shadows, looking at me with the same great, greyish-blue eyes which gazed upon <b>me</b> <b>now</b> <b>from</b> Marian Lindsay's face--the same face, matured into gracious womanhood, that I had seen ten years ago; and loved--aye, loved--ever since. I took an unsteady step forward.|$|R

We have dealt bravely with the infidel of late; the {{treaty with the}} Emperor is not to our wrong; and the anger of the church, for the late seeming breach of confidence on our part, has been diverted. We owe something in the latter affair to a young Neapolitan, who sojourns here at Venice, and who is not without interest at the Holy See, by reason of his uncle, the Cardinal Secretary. Much good {{is done by the}} influence of friends properly employed. 'Tis the secret of our success in the actual condition of Venice; for that which power cannot achieve must be trusted to favor and a wise moderation." ...|$|R

Satisfied of the effect, I sought the apartment of Mr. Rowley of the Rueful Countenance, and found him less yellow, but still contrite, and listening to Mrs. McRankine, who sat with open book by his bedside, and plied him with pertinent dehortations from the Book of Proverbs.|$|R
