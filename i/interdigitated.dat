25|$|Insulin is {{produced}} {{and stored in}} the body as a hexamer (a unit of six insulin molecules), while the active form is the monomer. The hexamer is an inactive form with long-term stability, {{which serves as a}} way to keep the highly reactive insulin protected, yet readily available. The hexamer-monomer conversion is one of the central aspects of insulin formulations for injection. The hexamer is far more stable than the monomer, which is desirable for practical reasons; however, the monomer is a much faster-reacting drug because diffusion rate is inversely related to particle size. A fast-reacting drug means insulin injections do not have to precede mealtimes by hours, which in turn gives people with diabetes more flexibility in their daily schedules. Insulin can aggregate and form fibrillar <b>interdigitated</b> beta-sheets. This can cause injection amyloidosis, and prevents the storage of insulin for long periods.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} MTs {{attached}} to one kinetochore is variable: in Saccharomyces cerevisiae only one MT binds each kinetochore, whereas in mammals {{there can be}} among 15-35 MTs bound to each kinetochore. However, not all the MTs in the spindle attach to one kinetochore. There are MTs that extend from one centrosome to the other (and {{they are responsible for}} spindle length) and some shorter ones are <b>interdigitated</b> between the long MTs. Professor B. Nicklas (Duke University), showed that, if one breaks down the MT-kinetochore attachment using a laser beam, chromatids can no longer move, leading to an abnormal chromosome distribution. These experiments also showed that kinetochores have polarity, and that kinetochore attachment to MTs emanating from one or the other centrosome will depend on its orientation. This specificity guarantees that only one chromatid will move to each spindle side, thus ensuring the correct distribution of the genetic material. Thus, one of the basic functions of the kinetochore is the MT attachment to the spindle, which is essential to correctly segregate sister chromatids. If anchoring is incorrect, errors may ensue, generating aneuploidy, with catastrophic consequences for the cell. To prevent this from happening, there are mechanisms of error detection and correction (as the spindle assembly checkpoint), whose components reside also on the kinetochores.The movement of one chromatid towards the centrosome is produced primarily by MT depolymerization in the binding site with the kinetochore. These movements require also force generation, involving molecular motors likewise located on the kinetochores.|$|E
60|$|The dump I best {{remember}} I {{visited on}} a wet and windy day. Over a great space of ground the sidings of the rail-head spread, the normal gauge rail-head spread {{out like a}} fan and <b>interdigitated</b> with the narrow gauge lines that go up practically to the guns. And also at the sides camions were loading, and an officer from the Midi in charge {{of one of these}} was being dramatically indignant at five minutes' delay. Between these two sets of lines, shells were piled of all sizes, I should think some hundreds of thousands of shells altogether, wet and shining in the rain. French reservists, soldiers from Madagascar, and some Senegalese were busy at different points loading and unloading the precious freights. A little way from me were despondent-looking German prisoners handling timber. All this dump was no more than an eddy as it were {{in the path of the}} shell from its birth from the steel bars near Paris to the accomplishment of its destiny in the destruction or capture of more Germans.|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} a recurrent sarcoma involving the soft tissues of the posterior mediastinum with features of both follicular dendritic and <b>interdigitating</b> dendritic cells. Histologically, the tumour, {{which was a}} recurrent neoplasm 19 years after the initial removal, was composed of bland spindle shaped cells with interspersed inflammatory cells, predominantly lymphocytes. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells were positive for S 100 protein, CD 45, CD 68, and vimentin, but negative for CD 21 and CD 35 (markers of follicular dendritic cells). The immunophenotype was in keeping with <b>interdigitating</b> dendritic cells. However, ultrastructural examination demonstrated elongated cell processes joined by desmosome-like junctions—features in keeping with follicular dendritic cells. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma and <b>interdigitating</b> dendritic cell sarcoma are rare neoplasms and a high index of suspicion is required to make a correct diagnosis.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} the NLDC- 145 antigenic determinant on <b>interdigitating</b> cells in T-cell dependent areas of lymphoid organs, rosettes were isolated from <b>interdigitating</b> cells and lymphocytes from lymph nodes. By using allotypic mixtures it was established that these rosettes represented pre-existing associations of <b>interdigitating</b> cells and lymphocytes. Phenotypic analysis of the lymphocytes showed that most cells in these rosettes were T cells. After antigenic stimulation, an increase of helper T cells and of B cells associated with the rosettes was found. Incubation of the rosettes with the NLDC- 145 antibody did not alter the composition of the rosettes. By neonatal injection of the NLDC- 145 antibody, the influence of the antigen on T-cell differentiation and antigen presenting was investigated. Although the antibody could be detected easily on <b>interdigitating</b> cells and thymus cortex of injected animals, no direct influence of long-term injections of the antibody from birth on antigen presentation and T-cell differentiation was found...|$|R

50|$|The basic surface {{acoustic}} wave device consists of a piezoelectric substrate, an input <b>interdigitated</b> transducer (IDT) {{on one side of}} the surface of the substrate, and a second, output <b>interdigitated</b> transducer on the other side of the substrate.
