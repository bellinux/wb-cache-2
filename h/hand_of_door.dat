60|$|As Dave {{leaned down}} to give Poole his <b>hand,</b> the <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the barn was flung open and a farmer strode in, a lantern {{in one hand and}} a stout stick in the other. The man held the light over his head and looked around suspiciously.|$|R
6000|$|At the furthermost end {{from the}} door was a semicircular alcove, known as the [...] "Shell," [...] which gave {{its name to the}} form sitting there. On both sides ran rows of benches and narrow desks, three deep, raised one above the other. On the left hand on {{entering}} was the Under School, and, standing {{on the floor in front}} of it, was the arm-chair of Mr. Wire. Next came the monitor's desk, at which the captain and two monitors sat. In an open drawer in front of the table were laid the rods, which were not unfrequently called into requisition. Extending up to the end were the seats of the Sixth. The [...] "Upper Shell" [...] occupied the alcove; the [...] "Under Shell" [...] were next to them, on the further benches on the right-hand side. Mr. Richards presided over the [...] "Shell." [...] Mr. Sargent took the Upper and Under Fifth, who came next to them, and [...] "Johnny," [...] as Mr. Johns was called, looked after the two Fourths, who occupied benches on the right <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> the <b>door.</b>|$|R
60|$|Will rose noiselessly, {{slipped on}} his {{trousers}} and shoes and--taking up a revolver in one hand, and a sword in another--stole downstairs; followed by Yossouf, {{with his long}} Afghan knife in his <b>hand.</b> The <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the warehouse was open; and within it Will saw, by the faint light of a lamp which one of them carried, four Afghan ruffians engaged in making up silks into large bundles, in readiness to carry off. His approach was unnoticed; and on reaching the door he leveled his pistol, and shouted to the Afghans to surrender, as his prisoners.|$|R
60|$|Meantime Rosalie and the Invisible Prince had reached, hand in <b>hand,</b> a <b>door</b> <b>of</b> {{the gallery}} which led through a terrace into the gardens.

No one can speak {{as long as he}} is invisible, and besides, they knew that the spirits were all around them, and at the slightest sound they would be recognised; so all they could do was to feel about in the hope that their hands might once more meet.|$|R

60|$|You will say, perhaps, I am too sensitive, that sights {{as painful}} abound in cancer {{hospitals}} and are confronted daily by doctors and nurses. I have long learned to admire and envy {{the doctors and}} the nurses. But there is no cancer hospital so large and populous as Kalawao and Kalaupapa; and in such a matter every fresh case, like every inch of length in the pipe of an organ, deepens the note of the impression; for what daunts the onlooker is that monstrous sum of human suffering by which he stands surrounded. Lastly, no doctor or nurse is called upon to enter once for all the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> that gehenna; they do not say farewell, they need not abandon hope, on its sad threshold; they but go for a time to their high calling, and can look forward as they go to relief, to recreation, and to rest. But Damien shut-to with his own <b>hand</b> the <b>doors</b> <b>of</b> his own sepulchre.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{seeks to}} {{discover}} whether aviation security measures are costeffective by considering their effectiveness, their cost and expected lives saved {{as a result}} of such expenditure. An assessment of the Federal Air Marshal Service suggests that the annual cost is $ 180 million per life saved. This is greatly in excess of the regulatory safety goal (societal willingness to pay to save a life) of $ 1 –$ 10 million per life saved. As such, the air marshal program fails a cost-benefit analysis. In addition, the opportunity cost of these expenditures is considerable, and it is highly likely that far more lives would have been saved if the money had been invested instead {{in a wide range of}} more cost-effective risk mitigation programs. On the other <b>hand,</b> hardening <b>of</b> cockpit <b>doors</b> has an annual cost of only $ 800, 00 per life saved, showing that this is a cost-effective security measure...|$|R

60|$|Arthur {{gave his}} horse to the groom at the rectory gate, and {{walked along the}} gravel towards the door which opened on the garden. He knew that the rector always breakfasted in his study, and the study lay on the left <b>hand</b> <b>of</b> this <b>door,</b> {{opposite}} the dining-room. It was a small low room, belonging to the old part of the house--dark with the sombre covers of the books that lined the walls; yet it looked very cheery this morning as Arthur reached the open window. For the morning sun fell aslant on the great glass globe with gold fish in it, which stood on a scagliola pillar {{in front of the}} ready-spread bachelor breakfast-table, and by the side of this breakfast-table was a group which would have made any room enticing. In the crimson damask easy-chair sat Mr. Irwine, with that radiant freshness which he always had when he came from his morning toilet; his finely formed plump white hand was playing along Juno's brown curly back; and close to Juno's tail, which was wagging with calm matronly pleasure, the two brown pups were rolling over each other in an ecstatic duet of worrying noises. On a cushion a little removed sat Pug, with the air of a maiden lady, who looked on these familiarities as animal weaknesses, which she made as little show as possible of observing. On the table, at Mr. Irwine's elbow, lay the first volume of the Foulis AEschylus, which Arthur knew well by sight; and the silver coffee-pot, which Carroll was bringing in, sent forth a fragrant steam which completed the delights of a bachelor breakfast.|$|R

5000|$|Washington State Patrol {{patrol cars}} are usually white in color, however {{they can be}} of any color or make. The typical marked unit {{features}} two prominent features: the Washington State Patrol shield logo, and the dark blue thunderbolt that underlies the State Patrol shield. In addition, marked vehicles bearing these markings usually feature the words [...] "STATE PATROL" [...] above the shield and thunderbolt, and these features are usually found on the front right hand and front left <b>hand</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle. Washington State Patrol also operates unmarked units, including SUVs and sports cars such as the Camaro, and luxury cars such as Volvo. Newer vehicles such as the Chevrolet Impala and the Dodge Charger {{have been added to}} the motor pool. Some patrol cars are marked, but do not have light bars. The Washington State Patrol's marked vehicles have been the Ford Crown Victoria, which has been retired and the last of the 'Crown Vics' was deployed at the end of June 2012. The new marked patrol vehicles were supposed to be the Chevrolet Caprice, but issues with reliability caused the patrol to abandon the Caprice. The new standard patrol vehicle is the Ford Interceptor Utility.|$|R
