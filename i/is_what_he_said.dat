2500|$|According to the Russian {{historian}} Boris Vadimovich Sokolov, Lend-Lease {{played a}} crucial role in winning the war:On the whole the following conclusion can be drawn: that without these Western shipments under Lend-Lease the Soviet Union not only would not have been able to win the Great Patriotic War, it would not have been able even to oppose the German invaders, since it could not itself produce sufficient quantities of arms and military equipment or adequate supplies of fuel and ammunition. The Soviet authorities were well aware of this dependency on Lend-Lease. Thus, Stalin told Harry Hopkins [...] that the U.S.S.R. could not match Germany's might as an occupier of Europe and its resources.Nikita Khrushchev, having served as a military commissar and intermediary between Stalin and his generals during the war, addressed directly the significance of Lend-lease aid in his memoirs:I would like to express my candid opinion about Stalinâ€™s views on whether the Red Army and the Soviet Union could have coped with Nazi Germany and survived the war without aid from the United States and Britain. First, I would like to tell about some remarks Stalin made and repeated several times when we were [...] "discussing freely" [...] among ourselves. He stated bluntly that if the United States had not helped us, we would not have won the war. If we had had to fight Nazi Germany one on one, we could not have stood up against Germany's pressure, and we would have lost the war. No one ever discussed this subject officially, and I don't think Stalin left any written evidence of his opinion, but I will state here that several times in conversations with me he noted that these were the actual circumstances. He never made a special point of holding a conversation on the subject, but when we were engaged in some kind of relaxed conversation, going over international questions of the past and present, and when we would return to the subject of the path we had traveled during the war, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> When I listened to his remarks, I was fully in agreement with him, and today I am even more so.|$|E
6000|$|And this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> at last (his {{feelings}} matter not):-- [...] "I think we've {{tapped a}} private line. Hi! Threes about there! Trot!" ...|$|E
60|$|That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> and I {{only hope}} that he was right, since at present there is {{something}} very wrong with the world, especially in Africa.|$|E
6000|$|... "You damn chechako," [...] <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but in {{the saying}} of it was admiration. [...] "I don't know how you done it, but you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{were always}} {{laughing}} at people's crazes," [...] <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "and {{now you have}} a craze of your own. But we won't discuss that." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{deception}} {{had found}} her out. But Jon--she felt--had forgiven that. It <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> of his mother which caused the fluttering in her heart and the weak sensation in her legs.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{the most}} horrible woman I can imagine. Good God! if I had {{had to live with}} you!" [...] That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to her in answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "OLD Stick!" [...] {{said the}} Rocket, [...] "impossible! GOLD Stick, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Gold Stick is very complimentary. In fact, he {{mistakes}} me {{for one of}} the Court dignitaries!" ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a {{wise man}} once, a very wise man, {{and a very good}} man, who wrote a poem about the {{feelings}} which some children have about having lived before; and this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> - ...|$|E
60|$|It wasn't that {{he spoke}} loud. He has one of those soft, {{soothing}} voices that slide through the atmosphere like the note of a far-off sheep. It <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> made me leap like a young gazelle.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Can I have {{forgotten}} the words? But I KNOW that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said!</b> And I saw the diamonds with my own eyes!' Then suddenly he seized the cock, shut it into the basket, and rushed out of the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I couldn't {{hardly wait}} till I got to Boston," [...] said Si, for that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{all of his}} friends [...] "to hum" [...] called him. [...] "We'll lick the Spanish out of their boots, see if we don't!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cheek,' {{repeated}} Riderhood, with {{an angry}} oath; 'cheek <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> He can't say nothing but cheek. I'd ha' liked to plump down aboard of him, neck and crop, {{with a heavy}} jump, and sunk him.' ...|$|E
60|$|FIRST PEASANT. But doesn't a gold piece glitter {{like the}} sun? That's what my father, who'd seen better days, Told me when I {{was but a}} little boy-- So high--so high, it's shining like the sun, Round and shining, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "It is ever thus," [...] said Sanchez, sententiously; [...] "it <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> last night, when I {{picked him}} up on the mound. He will sleep now--thou shalt see. He will get no further than Koorotora and the coyote--and then he will sleep." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The boy had one chanct in {{a hundred}} o' winning out," [...] <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "One chanct {{in a hundred}}, an' you knew it! If he had broken his neck I'd 'a' held you responsible, an' so would the boss." ...|$|R
50|$|John and The Blonde {{emerge from}} the station and tell The Rancher and The Chief why they are doing this. Also, she tells them that Elvis {{destroyed}} the mask when he realized he wouldn't {{be able to sell}} it. That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to her before dying.|$|R
60|$|Bahama Bill {{pointed in}} front of him, where a large {{quantity}} of rocks lay in a scattered mass, many of them ten and twenty tons in weight. At one point <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> had <b>been</b> {{the entrance to the}} cave, but this was completely blocked by the stones.|$|R
6000|$|But doesn't a gold piece glitter {{like the}} sun? [...] That's what my father, who'd seen better days, [...] Told me when I {{was but a}} little boy-- [...] So high--so high, it's shining like the sun, [...] Round and shining, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The {{church is}} a very {{powerful}} molder of public opinion, and Mr. Rutland is very impressive. (Running over the notes and producing a clipping.) This <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> in his sermon two weeks ago: [...] "God has given to Mr. Starkweather the talent for making money as truly as God has given to other men the genius which manifests itself in literature and the arts and sciences." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To put it plainly, this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> If Mr. Noel Vanstone ever {{discovers that}} you have knowingly married him under a false name, he can apply to the Ecclesiastical Court to have his {{marriage}} declared null and void. The issue of the application would rest with the judges. But if he could prove {{that he had been}} intentionally deceived, the legal opinion is that his case would be a strong one." ...|$|E
60|$|At length the portentous {{silence was}} broken {{and a voice}} spoke, the voice of Nam the priest. In the silence all that he uttered could be heard plainly, but his words came from far away, {{and the sound of}} them was still and small. This <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> as Juanna told it to them after the ceremony.|$|R
6000|$|... '"He {{shall not}} weary for my death, Chuff;" [...] that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> next,' pursued the old clerk, as {{he wiped his}} eyes; 'that <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> next, crying like a little child: [...] "He shall not weary for my death, Chuff. He shall have it now; he shall marry where he has a fancy, Chuff, {{although}} it don't please me; and you and I will go away and live upon a little. I always loved him; perhaps he'll love me then. It's a dreadful thing to have my own child thirsting for my death. But I might have known it. I have sown, and I must reap. He shall believe that I am taking this; and when I see that he is sorry, and has all he wants, I'll tell him that I found it out, and I'll forgive him. He'll make a better man of his own son, and be a better man himself, perhaps, Chuff!"' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{not taking}} this very well," [...] {{observed}} Mr. Jones. This <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but {{as a matter of}} fact he thought that the business was shaping quite satisfactorily. The man, <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to himself, had no stomach for a fight. Aloud he continued: [...] "Come! You can't expect to have it always your own way. You are a man of the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|About {{this time}} I {{became aware that}} he was {{discussing}} the copyright question. Here, so far as I remember, <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Attend to the words of the oracle through this unworthy medium transmitted. You {{will never be able to}} imagine the long, slow surge of the drawl, and the deadly gravity of the countenance, the quaint pucker of the body, one foot thrown over the arm of the chair, the yellow pipe clinched in one corner of the mouth, and the right hand casually caressing the square chin:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Just then, {{a single}} {{voice in the}} {{distance}} was understood to shout [...] "A speech from the Chancellor!" [...] "Certainly, my friends!" [...] the Chancellor replied with extraordinary promptitude. [...] "You shall have a speech!" [...] Here one of the waiters, who had been for some minutes busy making a queer-looking mixture of egg and sherry, respectfully presented it on a large silver salver. The Chancellor took it haughtily, drank it off thoughtfully, smiled benevolently on the happy waiter as he set down the empty glass, and began. To {{the best of my}} recollection this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{was turning}} {{it all over}} in his mind and {{studying}} what it could mean, {{when he came to}} a little muddy place {{on the bank of the}} Laughing Brook, and there he saw something that made his eyes look as if they would pop right out of his head, and it was right then that he felt his hair rise. Anyway, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> when he told about it afterward. What was it he saw? What do you think? Why, it was a footprint in the soft mud. Yes, Sir, that's what it was, and all it was. But it was the biggest footprint Farmer Brown's boy ever had seen, and it looked as if it had been made only a few minutes before. It was the footprint of Buster Bear.|$|E
60|$|This <b>was</b> not <b>what</b> Mr. Bulstrode said to any man for {{the sake}} of deceiving him: it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to himself--it <b>was</b> as {{genuinely}} his mode of explaining events as any theory of yours may be, if you happen to disagree with him. For the egoism which enters into our theories does not affect their sincerity; rather, the more our egoism is satisfied, the more robust is our belief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Singing indeed, {{but where}} we cannot hear him," [...] she answered. [...] "'Whiter than the snow, clearer than the ice-cave, more solemn than the choir. They will come at last.' That <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> even as <b>he</b> entered there." [...] And the low dove-like tone and tender calm face {{continued}} upon Ebbo the spell that the chant had left. He dozed as though still lulled by its echo.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> on {{the like}} {{occasions}} {{for the last}} thirty years; but Mrs. Calcott was as wise as ever in other folks' matters.|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Colonel Quaritch," [...] he went on, {{shaking off}} his oppression with a curious rapidity that was {{characteristic}} of him, [...] "what {{do you say}} to coming up to the Castle for your dinner? You must be in a mess here, and I expect that old Mrs. Jobson, whom my man George tells me you have got to look after you, will be glad enough to be rid of you for to-night. What do you say?--take the place as you find it, you know. I {{believe that there is a}} leg of mutton for dinner if there is nothing else, because instead of minding his own business I saw George going off to Boisingham to fetch it this morning. At least, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he was going for; just an excuse to gossip and idle, I fancy." ...|$|E
60|$|And, {{because the}} Lord is at hand, be anxious about nothing. The word {{here is the}} same as in the Sermon on the Mount. It means do not fret; do not terrify yourselves; for the Lord is at hand; he knows what you want: and will he not give it? Is not Christmas-day a sign that he will give it--a pledge of his love? What did he do on the first Christmas-day? What did he shew himself to be on the first Christmas-day? Now, here is the root of the whole matter, and a deep root it is; as deep as the {{beginning}} of all things which are, or ever were, or ever will be. And yet if we will believe our Bibles, it is a root which we all may find. What did the angels say the first Christmas night? Peace on earth, and goodwill to men. That is what God proclaimed. That <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> that he had, and would give.|$|E
50|$|And this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to her...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should not}} be angry at the fellow's death, seeing that it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> of you which brought it upon him," [...] Meyer replied with meaning. [...] "Otherwise he might have gone unharmed as far as I was concerned. For the rest, I did not {{interfere}} because I saw it was useless; also I am a fatalist like our friend, the Molimo, and believe in <b>what</b> <b>is</b> decreed. The truth is," [...] he added sharply, [...] "among savages ladies are not in place." ...|$|R
60|$|Nora smiled, but {{she said}} nothing. It was better, she thought, to let him tell his story; but his mode of telling it was not without its efficacy. It was not the simple praise which made its way with her but a certain tone in the words which seemed to {{convince}} her that they were true. If he had really found her, or fancied her to <b>be</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> there <b>was</b> a manliness in his telling her so in the plainest words that pleased her much.|$|R
60|$|He took my {{hand again}} {{and held it in}} his soft old hands, as if hesitating whether to {{transfer}} it to her, and my heart melted towards him. You may think it very odd, Dolly, but it <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> of my dear, dead husband that softened me. It made him seem very fatherly, and I felt the affection for him that I felt for my husband, when he seemed more like a father. Aristides and I often talk of it, and he has no wish that I should forget him.|$|R
