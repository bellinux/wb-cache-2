Such switches work satisfactorily with incandescent lamps, halogen lighting and non-electronic fluorescent fixtures, since the small current required for the switch's illuminating source {{is too small to}} produce any visible light from such devices controlled by the illuminated switch. However, if used to control compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs), the small amount of current required to energize the lighting source within switch also slowly charges the <b>internal</b> <b>input</b> capacitor in the electronic ballast of the CFL until the voltage across it rises {{to the point where it}} produces a brief discharge through the CFL.

40|$|In {{the near}} future, large, complex, time-critical missions, such as {{disaster}} relief, will likely require multiple unmanned vehicle (UV) operators, each controlling multiple vehicles, to combine their efforts as a team. However, is {{the effort of}} the team equal to {{the sum of the}} operator’s individual efforts? To help answer this question, a discrete event simulation model of a team of human operators, each performing supervisory control of multiple unmanned vehicles, was developed. The model consists of exogenous and <b>internal</b> <b>inputs,</b> operator servers, and a task allocation mechanism that disseminates events to the operators according to the team structure and state of the system. To generate the data necessary for model building and validation, an experimental test-bed was developed where teams of three operators controlled multiple UVs by using a simulated ground control station software interface. The team structure and inter-arrival time of exogenous events were both varied in a 2 x 2 full factorial design to gather data on the impact on system performance that occurs as a result of changing both exogenous and <b>internal</b> <b>inputs.</b> From the data that was gathered, the model was able to replicate the empirical results within a 95 % confidence interval for all four treatments, however more empirical data is needed to build confidence in the model’s predictive ability...|$|R

The time–ratio measurement technique cancels these errors when the sensor resistance equals the reference resistor and reduces errors around that point. We propose two simple methods of reducing those errors for sensors with a wide dynamic range. Both methods use time–ratio measurements. The first method uses several reference resistors covering the sensor resistance range; the second method uses two-point calibration. The second method is more efficient and yields errors that can be smaller than 0. 5 Ω for a sensor resistance from about 600 Ω to 3550 Ω. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

30|$|To specify state {{properties}} for system components in TTL, ontologies are used which are specified {{by a number}} of sorts, sorted constants, variables, functions and predicates. State properties are specified based on such ontology using a standard multi-sorted first-order predicate language. For every agent a number of ontologies can be distinguished used to specify state properties of different types. That is, the ontologies IntOnt(A), InOnt(A), OutOnt(A), and ExtOnt(A) are used to express respectively <b>internal,</b> <b>input,</b> output, and external state properties of agent A. Input ontologies contain elements for describing perceptions of an agent from the external world (e.g., observed(a) means that a component has an observation of state property a), whereas output ontologies describe actions and communications of agents (e.g., act(b) represents action b performed by an agent in its environment).|$|E

Results indicate dissociative symptoms, dysmorphic face perceptions, and hallucination-like strange-face apparitions. Dissociative symptoms and face dysmorphia were correlated. Strange-face apparitions were non-correlated with dissociation and dysmorphia. These results indicate that dissociative symptoms and hallucinatory phenomena during interpersonal-gazing under low illumination can involve different processes. Strange-face apparitions may characterize the rebound to "reality" (perceptual reality caused by external stimulus and hallucinatory reality caused by <b>internal</b> <b>input)</b> from a dissociative state induced by sensory deprivation. These phenomena may explain psychodynamic projections of the subject's unconscious meanings into the other's face.

40|$|Internal {{representations}} of the environment are often invoked to explain performance in tasks in which an organism must make a detour around an obstacle to reach a target and the organism can {{lose sight of the}} target along the path to the target. By simulating a detour task in evolving populations of robots (Khepera) we show that neural networks with memory units perform better than networks without memory units in this task. However, the content of the memory units need not be interpreted as an internal representation of the position of target. The memory units send a time-varying internally generated input to the network's hidden units that allows the network to generate the appropriate behavior even when there is no external input. Networks without memory units do not have this <b>internal</b> <b>input</b> and this explains their inferior performance. 1 Detour behavior Imagine a robot (an artificial organism) that must reach a target object located somewhere in the environment.

Discrimination could be achieved by delivering an effector gene expressed under a highly active context-specific promoter.

Here, we constructed a dual-promoter integrator, which expresses an effector gene only when the combined activity of two <b>internal</b> <b>input</b> promoters is high. A tunable response provides flexibility in choosing promoter inputs and effector gene output. Experiments using one premalignant and four cancer cell lines, over awide range of promoter activities, revealed a digital-like response of input amplification following a sharp activation threshold.

40|$|If a {{specific}} moral trait can {{be associated with}} {{a specific}} neural substrate, then the extent of moral development will be contingent upon the development of the neural networks within the substrate in which the moral trait resides. Similarly, if extrinsic and/or intrinsic inputs that target a specific neural substrate for processing effects the development of the substrate, then such inputs will also effect the attainment of the moral stage of development associated with the substrate. Since the higher levels of moral development are associated with spiritual states of consciousness (Kohlberg, 1976), then factors that inhibit the attainment of higher states of moral development will also inhibit the attainment of higher states of spiritual consciousness.
