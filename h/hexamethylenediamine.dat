50|$|Nylon 66 (aka nylon 6-6, nylon 6/6 or nylon 6,6) {{is a type}} of {{polyamide}} or nylon. There {{are many}} types of nylon: the two most common for textile and plastics industries are nylon 6 and nylon 66. Nylon 66 is made of two monomers each containing 6 carbon atoms, <b>hexamethylenediamine</b> and adipic acid, which give nylon 66 its name.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexamethylenediamine</b> is used almost {{exclusively}} {{for the production of}} polymers, an application that takes advantage of its bifunctional structure. The great majority of the diamine is consumed by the production of nylon 66 via condensation with adipic acid.

The diamine also serves as a cross-linking agent in epoxy resins.|$|E
50|$|Bolton at {{this point}} made a bold and {{characteristically}} visionary decision. He decided that practical synthetic fibers could not be made from castor oil, the only practical source of sebacic acid. To use an agricultural product as a primary feedstock would mean the new synthetic material would have very similar mass production problems as existing natural fibers had.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{investigates the}} thermal {{degradation}} of eight linear amines loaded with CO 2 and H+.

Putrescine was the only amine under acid loading that was not thermally stable, suggesting that the reaction mechanism is initiated by H+.

40|$|A {{simple and}} easy {{technique}} is {{proposed for the}} preparation of dry hexamethylenediammonium adipate (HMA salt), using conventional dry-blending equipment. The process includes contacting adipic acid and <b>hexamethylenediamine,</b> {{in the presence of}} a cryogenic medium, which is used to depress the exothermic of the salt formation. The purpose is the formation of free-flowing HMA salt with good homogeneity and balanced end groups, which can be used as a starting intermediate in the polyamide industry. Critical parameters were studied, such as the nature and amount of cryogenic agent and the presence of water traces in the reacting mixture. Application in an industrial scale seems feasible so that all advantages of handling dry HMA salt instead of its components (adipic acid powder and <b>hexamethylenediamine</b> liquid) can be utilized.

40|$|The thermostabilization of {{some enzymes}} by amidination with dimethylsuberimidate was surveyed. In the enzymes investigated, a {{moderate}} increase of thermostability in glucose oxidase and invertase, and prominent increase in lactate dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenase and ascorbate oxidase were observed. The increase of thermostability by amidination was suggesting the synergism of {{the enhancement of}} intersubunit salt bridges and the conformational stabilization by intra- and intermolecular cross-linking. The coupling of oxidized dextran with periodate {{on the surface of}} the enzyme molecule (enzyme-dextran-conjugate) and the subsequent cross-linking with <b>hexamethylenediamine</b> were also proposed to enhance the thermostability. A moderate increase of thermostability was observed for catalase, ascorbate oxidase, lactate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase and a prominent increase was observed for diaphorase, (Y chymotripsin, glucose oxidase and invertase. Enhanced thermostabilities of enzymes may be attributed to the mild procedure of the preparation of enzyme-dextran-conjugate, the introduction of polyol structure on or around the surface of enzyme molecule and the intramolecular cross-linking with <b>hexamethylenediamine...</b>|$|E
40|$|The surfactant-like peptide (Ala) 6 -(Asp) (A 6 D) {{is shown}} to self-assemble into ultrathin (3 nm thick) nanosheets in aqueous {{solution}} above a critical aggregation concentration.
