5000|$|Hand tools: The {{hand tools}} are the usual {{complement}} of tools {{found in a}} complete auto mechanic's set except that auto specialty tools would be absent and some outsized tools would likely be present, such as 1 1/2" [...] (38 mm) open <b>end</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, one Marx product line showed a greater sophistication in toy offerings. The [...] "Fix All" [...] series was introduced, whose main {{attraction}} was larger plastic vehicles (about 14 inches long) {{that could be}} taken apart and put back together with included tools and equipment. A 1953 Pontiac convertible (erroneously identified on packaging as a sedan), and a 1953 Mercury Monterey station wagon which featured an articulated drive-line. Everything from the pistons to the crankshaft to the rear axle gears were visible through clear plastic, and wood-trim decals for the sides finished off this marvelous model. A very large 1953 Chrysler convertible, a 1953 Jaguar XK120 roadster, a WWII-era Willys Jeep, a Dodge-ish utility truck, a tow truck, a tractor, a larger scale motorcycle, a helicopter, {{and a couple of}} airplanes were all part of the Fix All series. The cars' boxes boasted features like [...] "Over 50 parts" [...] and [...] "For a real mechanic!" [...] As an example, the tow truck came with cast metal box and open wrenches, an adjustable <b>end</b> <b>wrench,</b> a two-piece jack, gas can, hammer, screwdriver, and fire extinguisher. The Jeep came with a star wrench, a screw jack and working lights.|$|E
40|$|Monitoring is {{the orderly}} collection, {{analysis}} and interpretation of information and data used to make short- and long-term management decisions (Wyoming Range Service Team 2001). Therefore, monitoring is an evaluation process used by animal and natural resource managers to help determine how rangeland or pasture systems respond to management (Holechek et al. 2004). The identification of monitoring as a process is crucial and suggests {{a number of important}} considerations. Monitoring has multiple components. This process includes not just collection, but also {{analysis and interpretation}} of information and data. Simply collecting information and data (for example taking lots of pictures) does not necessarily meet the definition of monitoring. The information and data collected as part of a monitoring effort must be put to use. The primary use of monitoring data and information is to support management decisions, and this requires analysis and interpretation of the information and data relative to management objectives, inputs and decisions. Analysis and interpretation are difficult or perhaps impossible in the absence of management objectives. Objectives facilitate evaluation by defining success. Natural resource objectives on grazing lands might describe the desired characteristics of vegetation, soil or water resources. Livestock or wildlife production objectives are often included in monitoring efforts as well. Finally, because monitoring is an ongoing process, organization and repeatability are important. Conducting monitoring efforts in an orderly manner ensures organization and repeatability. Evaluation of management decisions and actions relative to objectives depends on the ability to establish some relationship between management choices and responses observed on the land. The lack of organization and repeatability will likely lead to erroneous conclusions regarding the adequacy of management choices because differences (or lack there of) might be a result of different methods, timing or location of data / information collection. Monitoring is a tool that must be used properly. Tools have utility for particular tasks but may be useless if they don’t fit the application. When a piece of machinery breaks down, it is rarely productive to grab a 5 / 8 ” <b>end</b> <b>wrench</b> and start looking for something to tighten or loosen with it. It is much more effective to troubleshoot the problem, identify {{what needs to be done}} and then find the appropriate tool. Monitoring is very similar, so before addressing the what, when and how of monitoring grazing lands, it is important to establish why one would implement a monitoring program...|$|E
25|$|The {{blind man}} pesters {{the other for}} details. He wants to know: “Is it still day? Will it not soon be night? Is there grass anywhere?” He insists on {{listening}} for sounds which the other can’t hear. Eventually the wheelchair-using man has had enough and he starts to threaten the fiddler who at the very <b>end</b> <b>wrenches</b> the man’s pole from {{out of his hands}} at which point the action freezes in a final tableau.|$|R
50|$|A cone wrench or cone spanner {{is a tool}} used in bicycle {{assembly}} and maintenance to tighten and adjust the cones on a bicycle wheel. Cone wrenches are thinner and lighter than most other open <b>ended</b> <b>wrenches</b> {{that are used to}} work on bicycles. They should be used only for making adjustments to wheel's cones or for other applications such as centering brakes. Using a cone wrench in high torque applications such as loosening outer axle nuts may easily damage the wrench. Cone wrenches are typically about 2 mm thick, compared to approximately 7 mm for a standard open-ended wrench.|$|R
40|$|The {{tethering}} of sockets and wrenches {{was accomplished}} {{to improve the}} safety of working over motor segments. To accomplish the tethering of the sockets to the ratchets, a special design was implemented in which a groove was machined into each socket. Each socket was then fitted with a snap ring that can spin around the machined groove. The snap ring is tethered to {{the handle of the}} ratchet. All open <b>end</b> <b>wrenches</b> are also tethered to the ratchet or to the operator, depending upon the type. Tests were run to ensure that the modified tools meet torque requirements. The design was subsequently approved by Space Safety...|$|R
50|$|This is {{the third}} instrumental, and the sequel to the {{previous}} track. It opens with a sudden mood change from happy to dark, {{and the sound of}} a heart monitor which soon flatlines, leading into a chaotic instrumental that <b>ends</b> with <b>wrenching</b> guitar solos. As its title points, the Woman has died in childbirth, leaving the Man alone with his daughter.|$|R
5000|$|Some sockets are {{designed}} {{to have the same}} outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a [...] "special" [...] ratchet that fits {{on the outside of the}} socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications. By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations. Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for 1/4", 3/8" [...] and 1/2" [...] sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable 1/4-inch and 3/8-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets. They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names. Craftsman Tools call theirs--Max Axess, and also sells GearWrench's Pass-Thru brands. Lowes calls their socket system Xtreme Access, etc.. Ratcheting box <b>end</b> <b>wrenches</b> can often be employed in the same application but will nearly always be significantly wider.|$|R

60|$|At last Rupert saw by his opponent's {{eye that}} a new and special {{combination}} {{was about to be}} put into action against him, and he instantly steadied himself to resist it. It came with the rapidity of thought, but Rupert recognized it by the first pass as the very last combination which Monsieur Dessin had taught him, assuring him {{at the time that he}} would find it irresistible, for that there were not three men in Europe acquainted with it. He met the attack then with the defence which Monsieur Dessin had showed him to be the sure escape, <b>ending</b> with a <b>wrench</b> which nearly tore the sword from the hand of his opponent.|$|R
50|$|The {{most basic}} form of torque wrench {{consists}} of two beams. The first is a lever used to apply the torque to the fastener being tightened and serves also as {{the handle of the}} tool. When force is applied to the handle it will deflect predictably and proportionally with said force in accordance with Hooke's law. The second beam is only attached at one <b>end</b> to the <b>wrench</b> head and free on its other, this serves as the indicator beam. Both of these beams run parallel to each other when the tool is at rest, with the indicator beam usually on top. The indicator beam's free end is free to travel over a calibrated scale attached to the lever or handle, marked in units of torque. When the wrench is used to apply torque, the lever bends and the indicating beam stays straight. Thus the end of the indicating beam points to the magnitude of the torque that is currently being applied. This type of wrench is simple, inherently accurate, and inexpensive.|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} control strategies {{employed by}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) control movement or force generation in a limb, a seven degree of freedom cat hindlimb was modeled. In this study, the biomechanical constraints affecting force generation for balance and postural control were investigated. Due to the redundancies at the muscular and joint levels in the musculoskeletal system, even the muscle coordination pattern to statically produce a certain amount of force/torque at the ground is not straightforward. A 3 D musculoskeletal model of the cat hindlimb was created from cat cadaver measurements using Software for Interactive Musculoskeletal Systems (SIMM, Musculographics, Inc.). Six kinematic degrees of freedom and 31 individual hindlimb muscles were modeled. The moment arms of the muscles were extracted from the software model to be used in a linear transformation between muscle activation, and end effector force and moment. The Jacobian matrix that establishes the relationship between joint torques and <b>end</b> effector <b>wrench</b> was calculated. Maximal muscle forces were estimated from the literature. A feasible set of forces that can be generated at the toe was constructed using combination of maximally activated muscle excitations. Because the endpoint torque is typically small in a cat, an optimization algorithm was also performed to maximize the force generation at the end effector while constraining the magnitude of the endpoint torque. The results are compared with the measured force magnitude and direction data from an acute cat hindlimb preparation for different postures. This static model is applicable for understanding muscle coordination during postural responses to small balance perturbations. M. S.

2500|$|The typical {{structural}} ironworker {{tools are}} the spud wrench, bolt bag, sleever bars, bull pins, drift pins and beaters. The spud wrench {{is the most}} important tool of a structural ironworker because it serves dual purposes. [...] It is a wrench to tighten bolts, and the opposite <b>end</b> of the <b>wrench</b> can be used to align holes of beams with columns. It is made from a steel alloy, and it has a gradual taper to easily align bolt holes on beams. The bolt bag is a heavy canvas bag used for storing bolts and nuts that erect a structure. A sleever bar is a steel alloy bar used to pry on beams to put them in place, when a spud wrench is insufficient. [...] A beater is forged steel head mallet with a lacquered hickory handle for beating a tapered pin or bull pin into the bolt hole to align the others at the beam end or [...] "point" [...] and stuff the rest of the holes. Drift pins have a tapper on both ends and get to be the largest diameter in the center. Are used for aligning holes made up of multiple plates.|$|R
40|$|Within the {{territory}} of mourning, this thesis tells three autoethnographic stories of death; the unexpected death of the author’s 16 -year old brother, Grant, when she was herself a child; the later painful dying of her father; then the <b>wrenching</b> <b>ending</b> of her mother’s life. Within these significant encounters with death and loss, three particular moments are selected in {{an exploration of the}} ways in which mourning, materiality, space and time are co-implicated. These moments are shown to embody an intersection of mourning and materiality – as bodies, tears, feet, dresses, breasts and fluids – space and time. Poststructuralism and new materialist theorising frames the analysis {{of the ways in which}} mourning is both discursively and materially produced. Autoethnography becomes a diffractive methodology that uses self as data, including showing the professional learning/teaching moments in which the connections between mourning, bodies, tears and loss were first made visible to the author. In a further step, the thesis moves into the professional domain of counselling in a New Zealand secondary school. The author’s experience of a death in the school community becomes a reflecting surface for noticing the ways in which mourning rituals constitute the subjectivity of those grieving. The author suggests that her professional practice as a school guidance counsellor is shaped by her earlier personal family encounters with mourning. In particular, she suggests, the deconstruction of the stories of these encounters produced particular practices in her work with students, staff and a community touched by sudden death. Personal lived experiences with death and mourning are folded into the mourning school as a dynamic assemblage. In these ways, time and space are shown to meet with the temporal materiality of bodies (both alive and dead), tears, dresses, veils and fluids and their discursive implications, to produce a timespacemattering...|$|R
5000|$|Critical {{response}} to Harvard and Goldberg's seriocomic turn as bickering hired killers was overwhelmingly positive.
