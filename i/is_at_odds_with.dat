5|$|The {{synopsis}} <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the reviewers of {{the film}} who state that the arrow which reveals the hidden cache is shot by the little boy and not the mother. The image still shows the woman with a large bow, but further details by the reviewers state that the boy used a toy bow and arrow to make the shot.|$|E
5|$|Egyptologists {{have noted}} that instead of hiding their non-royal origins, Neferhotep I, his {{predecessor}} Sobekhotep III, and his successor Sobekhotep IV, remarkably proclaimed them on their stelae and scarab seals. This <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the traditional Egyptian system where {{the legitimacy of the}} new king rests mainly on his filiation. These proclamations of non-royal origins were possibly made to dissociate these kings from their immediate predecessors, in particular Seth Meribre whose monuments have been usurped and defaced. The reason for this remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|Naota later finds Haruko {{working in}} his house as a live-in maid. It is later {{discovered}} that Haruko is an investigator for the Galactic Space Police Brotherhood. Haruko uses Naota for her search for the Pirate King, Atomsk. She <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Medical Mechanica, a monolithic industrial corporation. Naota is being watched by Commander Amarao, a special agent of the Bureau of Interstellar Immigration, who believes that Medical Mechanica is out to conquer the galaxy. Naota is ultimately drawn into a three-way battle between Haruko, Amarao and Medical Mechanica.|$|E

50|$|Following {{an active}} 13th century, and after their move south the O'Donovans of Ui Chairbre fall into {{relative}} obscurity for approximately two centuries, primarily because the records for Munster {{during this period}} are few. Fragmenting into several smaller-sized lordships, they became subordinate to their overlord, MacCarthy Reagh, who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the MacCarthy Mor, who <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the MacCarthys of Muscrery, who <b>were</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> both the Norman settlers (Barrys) and the old Irish (O'Callahan, O'Keefe), and with Gaelicized English (Fitzgeralds- Earls of Desmonds, FitzGibbons - Earls of Kildare and the White Knight), {{all of whom were}} or were not, depending on changing politics, <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the English monarchs.|$|R
5|$|Several {{groups of}} {{characters}} serve as Felix's antagonists in The Lost Age. He <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> {{the heroes of}} the original Golden Sun, led by the young Venus Adept warrior Isaac, who pursue him across the World, Weyard under the belief that Alchemy would potentially destroy Weyard if unleashed. One of Saturos' original companions, a powerful and enigmatic Mercury Adept named Alex, allies himself with a second pair of powerful and imposing Mars Adept warriors, Karst and Agatio. They {{keep the pressure on}} Felix to ensure he proceeds with his quest as he is supposed to.|$|E
5|$|The abortion–breast cancer {{hypothesis}} {{posits that}} having an induced abortion {{can increase the}} risk of getting breast cancer. This hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> mainstream scientific opinion and is contradicted by major medical professional organizations. In early pregnancy, hormone levels increase, leading to breast growth. The hypothesis proposes that if this process is interrupted by an abortion then more immature cells could be left behind, resulting in a greater potential risk of breast cancer over time.|$|E

25|$|This {{situation}} <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> one of {{the objectives}} of TransJakarta which was to reduce traffic jam during rush hours by persuading private car owners to use comfortable public transport.|$|E
25|$|The slick, bold style – {{driven by}} digital {{animation}} software – <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the somewhat rustic {{quality of the}} old musical recordings but allows close synchronisation with the vocals. The smooth, repetitive, side-scrolling movement it effects assists in suspending the musical episode from the more consistent narrative plot.|$|E
25|$|Zach Roerig as Matt Donovan, Elena's {{childhood}} friend and ex-boyfriend, who became romantically involved with Caroline in season 1. They remain good friends even after breaking {{up during the}} third season. Matt wants no part in the supernatural events in his town and later <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the vampires as he becomes a police officer and tries to protect the town from them.|$|E

5000|$|Celeste Holm as Estelle Harris (1981-1983), Stephanie's wealthy grandmother, {{who would}} often <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Archie over his rearing of Stephanie.|$|R
5000|$|While this fictional {{company has}} {{encountered}} numerous superheroes, it has most notably <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Iron Man, as in a storyline called [...] "The Iron Age" [...] {{where it was}} revealed that agents of Roxxon Oil (then known as Republic Oil and Gas) killed Tony Stark's parents. Roxxon has also regularly <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Project Pegasus regarding energy sources as the latter has been involved with alternative energy research that could hurt Roxxon's oil profitability.|$|R
25|$|In January 2017, Budi Waseso, {{the chief}} of Indonesia's {{national}} narcotics agency, said that the pilot of Lion Air Flight 904 was {{under the influence of}} drugs {{at the time of the}} accident, and had hallucinated that the sea was part of the runway. That claim <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the statement made after the accident by Indonesia's transport ministry, which said the pilots had not tested positive for drugs.|$|E
25|$|At the European {{elections}} in 1999, he re-entered French politics {{as the leader}} of the French Green Party (Les Verts) list. He found considerable support in the French media, who often feature him, even when he does not represent or <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the party. He reached 9.72% of votes, a score since then unequalled by the French Greens until 2009 (16.28% of the votes), where he was the Green leader again.|$|E
25|$|Glenn Rhee and Tara Chambler depart {{ways from}} Abraham, Rosita and Eugene {{to go to}} Terminus, {{instead of going to}} Washington, D.C., in hopes of a cure. Glenn and Tara {{struggle}} on the way to Terminus, with their main objective to find Glenn's wife, Maggie Greene. Meanwhile, after Beth's mysterious disappearance, Daryl Dixon now has joined the group of Claimers led by Joe (Jeff Kober) but <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> some of its members.|$|E

5000|$|These [...] "laws" [...] are dogmas of GNM, not laws {{of nature}} or medicine, and <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> {{scientific}} understanding of human physiology.|$|R
25|$|Contemporary {{construction}} {{on college campuses}} is diverse, with construction mirroring and diverging from earlier styles and trends. Examples of deliberately referential or contextual architecture include Whitman College, at Princeton. Designed by Demetri Porphyrios, the college was built to resemble earlier {{construction on}} the campus in the Collegiate Gothic style, examples of which include Mathey and Rockefeller Colleges. This construction <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> other recently added buildings, such as the Lewis Science Library, by architect Frank Gehry, which is Deconstructivist in its design, and neighboring Butler College, partially drafted by postmodern architect Robert Venturi.|$|E
25|$|The terms 'First Age of the Sun' and 'Ages of the Sun' are {{commonly}} used by many fans, but do not appear anywhere in Tolkien's writings. The 'First Age of the Sun' in this conception is held {{to begin with the}} first rising of the Sun and continue until Morgoth's defeat nearly 600 years later. While this <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Tolkien's statements that the First Age was the longest by far it is a common misapprehension because the subsequent ages all took place entirely during the Years of the Sun.|$|E
25|$|Another example where visual {{appearance}} <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> measurement {{comes from}} the observation of apparent superluminal motion in various radio galaxies, BL Lac objects, quasars, and other astronomical objects that eject relativistic-speed jets of matter at narrow angles {{with respect to the}} viewer. An optical illusion results giving the appearance of faster than light travel. In Fig.1‑14, galaxy M87 streams out a high-speed jet of subatomic particles almost directly towards us, but Penrose–Terrell rotation causes the jet to appear to be moving laterally in the same manner that the appearance of the cube in Fig.1‑13 has been stretched out.|$|E
25|$|This {{appeared}} to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> Maxwell's wave theory of light, which {{predicted that the}} electron energy would be proportional to {{the intensity of the}} radiation.|$|R
25|$|Berlin had a traditionalist {{approach}} to Torah study that <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the highly analytical style of lomdus ("learned intellectual analysis") that was pioneered by Soloveitchik.|$|R
50|$|Historically, the ACA {{has opposed}} {{allowing}} pharmacists to substitute generic medications, {{a position that}} <b>was</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> that of the American Pharmacists Association (APhA) in 1972.|$|R
25|$|Some Canadian {{polls have}} {{referred}} in their questions to British monarchy or called the British monarch Canada's head of state. This terminology <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the contemporary situation in Canada, wherein the monarchy is a Canadian institution separate {{from that of}} the United Kingdom, being called the Canadian Crown and Canadian monarchy by the government and constitutional scholars, and the monarch is uniquely titled as Queen of Canada. The government of Saskatchewan has stated it is incorrect to denote the Canadian Royal Family as the British Royal Family. Additionally, the Queen of Canada is considered Canadian.|$|E
25|$|Others, however, view him {{not as a}} builder, {{but rather}} as a conqueror. He was of Albanian origin rather than Egyptian, and {{throughout}} his reign, Turkish was the official language of his court rather than Arabic. Some argue that he exploited Egyptian manpower and resources for his own personal ends, not Egyptian national ones, with the manpower requirements that he placed on Egyptians being particularly onerous. Taken together in this light, Muhammad Ali is cast by some as another {{in a long line of}} foreign conquerors dating back to the Persian occupation in 525B.C. This view, however, <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the majority opinion of Egyptian, and other Arab historians, and Egyptian public opinion.|$|E
25|$|The 50,000-year {{estimate}} <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> {{the chronology}} given in Asimov's later novels, in particular Foundation and Earth and The Caves of Steel. The latter novel {{indicates that the}} robot R. Daneel Olivaw was constructed some three thousand years after the founding of New York City. Foundation and Earth, in its concluding scene, establishes that Daneel survives into the Interregnum period, after the First Galactic Empire collapses. He gives his age as (roughly) twenty thousand years. The Galactic Era dating system, to which most of Asimov's Foundation Series adheres, places Foundation and Earth approximately twelve thousand years after the events of Pebble in the Sky. Adding up all the differences, Joseph Schwartz's time displacement ultimately transported him only some eleven millennia into the future.|$|E

25|$|Notwithstanding {{the formal}} {{alliance}} of COSATU with the ruling ANC party, it has <b>been</b> <b>at</b> <b>odds</b> <b>with</b> the government, {{calling for the}} roll-out of comprehensive public access to antiretroviral drugs.|$|R
