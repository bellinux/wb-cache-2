40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the prototypes of new pivot {{bearings}} having multiple degrees of freedom. The idea of the pivot bearing {{is based on a}} constant velocity joint(CVJ). First,two types of the pivot bearings with 2 DOF are designed and produced. Their design and some static specifications are described. Then,applying the pivot bearing with 2 DOF,three types of the pivot bearings with 3 DOF are prototyped. A <b>full</b> <b>complement</b> ball <b>bearing</b> mechanism is used in order to make smooth motion and downsizing is also aimed. Furthermore,process accuracy of the elements is examined...|$|R
