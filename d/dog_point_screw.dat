50|$|Assembling a dog sled team {{involves}} picking leader <b>dogs,</b> <b>point</b> <b>dogs,</b> swing dogs, and wheel dogs.

In dog sledding, Siberian Huskies or Alaskan Malamutes are the main types of dogs that are used for recreational sledding because of their strength and speed and endurance as well as their ability to withstand the cold. However, Alaskan Huskies (a mix between Siberian Huskies and Alaskan Malamutes) are also a popular dog for sled dog racing, because of their endurance, good eating habits, speed, and dedication to running even when tired.|$|R
