5|$|On {{the opening}} day of Cowboys & Aliens, {{estimates}} showed that its opening day gross was $13.0 million and it came in second place to The Smurfs opening day gross of $13.3 million. This was considered a surprise since Cowboys & Aliens was expected to be the clear winner <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend.</b> Estimates then showed Cowboys & Aliens and The Smurfs tied at the #1 spot <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> with $36.2 million each. However, when the actual results <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> were announced Cowboys & Aliens won the weekend with $36.4 million just beating out The Smurfs, which grossed $35.6 million. The film grossed $100,240,551 in the U.S. and Canada (making it the 500th $100 million domestic movie) as well as $74,581,774 internationally, bringing its worldwide total to $174,822,325.
