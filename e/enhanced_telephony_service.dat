50|$|The IN concepts, {{architecture}} and protocols were originally developed as standards by the ITU-T {{which is the}} standardization committee of the International Telecommunication Union; prior to this a number of telecommunications providers had proprietary implementations. The primary aim of the IN was to <b>enhance</b> the core <b>telephony</b> <b>services</b> offered by traditional telecommunications networks, which usually amounted to making and receiving voice calls, sometimes with call divert. This core would then provide a basis upon which operators could build services {{in addition to those}} already present on a standard telephone exchange.|$|R

Using the intelligent network (IN) approach for supporting telecommunications services enables the use of productivity-enhancing techniques for the creation of new services. Rather than creating new services by cutting fresh software code, modules of service-independent logic can be arranged using graphical user interfaces. As a result, advanced telecommunications services, which are independent of the central switch, can be created more quickly than ever...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Internet {{telephony}} now {{enables a}} wealth of new communication <b>services.</b> Traditional <b>telephony</b> <b>services,</b> such as cal forwarding, call waiting or call transfer can be enhanced with directory services, Web, or e-mail. Programmability of Internet <b>telephony</b> <b>services</b> is a crucial issue for providing these services. There is a strong connection between programming Internet <b>telephony</b> <b>services</b> and the protocols that are used for their delivery. Among them, the signalling protocols play an important role. A number of protocols have been defined for Internet. In this paper, we concern ourselves only with SIP.

In this paper, we {{analyze the}} {{stochastic}} {{characteristics of the}} mea-sured video <b>telephony</b> <b>service</b> traffic and propose a mathematical model of the video <b>telephony</b> <b>service</b> traffic based on the analyzed stochastic characteristics. From our analysis, a voice traffic can be modelled by a renewal process with deterministic inter-arrival times and fixed packet size. On the other hand, a video traffic is modelled by an on and off source, where on and off periods are according to gamma distributions with respective parameters. Using the mathematical model, we estimate the required bandwidth to satisfy a given Quality of Service (QoS) requirement for the video <b>telephony</b> <b>service</b> traffic. To show the validity of our analysis, numerical studies with the NS- 2 simulator are provided...|$|R
