50|$|High {{explosives}} (HE) are {{explosive materials}} that detonate, {{meaning that the}} explosive shock front passes through the material at a supersonic speed. High explosives detonate with explosive velocity ranging from 3 to 9 km/s. For instance, TNT has a <b>detonation</b> (burn) <b>rate</b> of approximately 5.8 km/s (19,000 feet per second), Detonating cord of 6.7 km/s (22,000 feet per second), and C-4 about 8.5 km/s (29,000 feet per second). They are normally employed in mining, demolition, and military applications. They {{can be divided into}} two explosives classes differentiated by sensitivity: primary explosive and secondary explosive. The term high explosive is in contrast with the term low explosive, which explodes (deflagrates) at a lower rate. They are stable and quite insensitive to fire and mechanical shocks.|$|R
2500|$|During {{the first}} hour after a nuclear explosion, {{radioactivity}} levels drop precipitously. Radioactivity levels are further reduced by about 90% after another 7 hours and by about 99% after 2 days. An accurate rule of thumb for approximating the radioactive dose rate produced by the decay of the myriad of isotopes present in nuclear fallout is the [...] "7/10 rule". The rule states that for each 7 fold increase in time the dose rate drops {{by a factor of}} 10. For example, assuming the fallout process has ended and the dose rate is a lethal in one hour exposure, 500 roentgens per hour, at one hour after detonation, then 7 hours after <b>detonation</b> the <b>rate</b> will be 50 R/hr, 49 hours after detonation (7×7 hours) the dose rate will be 5 R/hr, 343 hours after detonation (49×7—or about 2 weeks) the dose rate will be about 0.5 R/hr, at which point no special precautions would need to be taken and venturing outside into that dose rate {{for an hour or two}} would pose a close to negligible health hazard, thus permitting an evacuation to be done with acceptable safety to a known contamination free zone. Following a surface-burst nuclear detonation, approximately 80 percent of the fallout would be deposited on the ground during the first 24 hours.|$|R
40|$|A simple {{analytic}} model allows prediction of rate constants and size effect behavior before a hydrocode run if size effect data exists. At infinite radius, it defines not only detonation velocity but also average <b>detonation</b> <b>rate,</b> pressure and energy. This allows the derivation of a generalized radius, which becomes larger as the explosive becomes more non-ideal. The model {{is applied to}} near-ideal PBX 9404, in-between ANFO and most non-ideal AN. The power of the pressure declines from 2. 3, 1. 5 to 0. 8 across this set. The power of the burn fraction, F, is 0. 8, 0 and 0, so that an F-term is important only for the ideal explosives. The size effect shapes change from concave-down to nearly straight to concave-up. Failure is associated with ideal explosives when the calculated detonation velocity turns in a double-valued way. The effect {{of the power of}} the pressure may be simulated by including a pressure cutoff in the <b>detonation</b> <b>rate.</b> The models allows comparison of a wide spectrum of explosives providing that a single <b>detonation</b> <b>rate</b> is feasible...|$|E

40|$|We have {{employed}} {{the method of}} molecular dynamics in a preliminary study of the initiation of detonation in an energetic molecular crystal containing vacancy defects. The model was a two-dimensional filament of 8 x 240 diatomic molecules which were capable of undergoing exothermic dissociation. The reaction was initiated {{at one end of}} the filament by heating. The ensuing dynamics of detonation was followed by calculating the motions of the dissociating molecules as a function of time. The results showed that with this particular model, there was a tendency for the vacancies to diffuse by thermal motion, and that the net effect of the vacancies was the reduction of the caging effect on dissociation. This in turn produced a measurable effect on the initiation of <b>detonation,</b> the reaction <b>rate,</b> the energy and the stress profiles, and the shock propagation velocity. In order to study the effect of a cluster of vacancies on iniitiation, it will be necessary to modify the interatomic-intermolecular potentials so as to stabilize the vacancy configuration...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT An {{environmentally}} friendly, {{cost effective}} {{technology has been}} developed and demonstrated {{by a team of}} Naval Air Warfare Center and Lockheed Martin personnel to dispose of Shillelagh solid rocket motor propellants. The Shillelagh is a surface to surface anti-tank weapon approaching the end of its service life. The current demilitarization process employs open detonation, but the presence of lead stearate in the N 5 propellant grain motivated the need for the development of an environmentally friendly disposal method. Contained burning of the propellant followed by propellant exhaust processing was chosen as the disposal methodology. The developmental test bed, completed in February 1998, is inexpensive and transportable. Contained burning of Shillelagh propellants posed two technical hurdles: 1) removal of the sub micron lead and cadmium particulate generated during combustion, and 2) secondary combustion of the significant quantifies of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. A firing chamber with a stepped nozzle, air injection, and active ignition was developed to combust the carbon monoxide and hydrogen in real time. The hot gases and particulates from the combustion process are completely contained within a gas holder. The gases are subsequently cooled and routed through a treatment facility to remove the heavy metal particulate. Results indicate that the lead and cadmium particulates are removed below their respective detection limits (2 micro-g/cu m & 0. 2 micro-g/cu m) of the analytical procedures employed and that the carbon monoxide and hydrogen levels have been reduced well below the lower flammability limits. Organic concentrations, principally benzene, are I ppm or less. A semi-automated machine has been developed which can rapidly prepare Shillelagh missiles for the contained burn facility. This machine allows the contained burn technology to be more competitive with current open bum open <b>detonation</b> disposal <b>rates...</b>|$|R

Experimental fume measurements were obtained in the Bureau's large closed gallery facility (7. 2 x 10 /sup 4 / liter expansion chamber) and in the standard Crawshaw-Jones apparatus (90 -liter expansion chamber) using a prepackaged charge configuration containing about 450 g of explosives. The theoretical calculation of toxic fumes was achieved with an equilibrium detonation code called TIGER. Contrary to initial expectations, the NO/sub x/ (= NO + NO/sub 2 /) fumes from the large gallery test were found to be in essential agreement with the Crawshaw-Jones results. It was also concluded that TIGER calculations offer a good approach to the prediction of toxic fumes; there is a basic problem in extrapolating laboratory measurements of CO fumes to mine conditions, this being due to postdetonation oxidation of CO to CO/sub 2 /; and the <b>detonation</b> velocity decay <b>rate</b> of an explosive is a useful experimental parameter for correlating toxic fumes production with nonideal detonation behavior.

40|$|Linked CHEETAH is a thermo-chemical code {{coupled to}} a 2 -D hydrocode. Initially, a quadratic-pressure {{dependent}} kinetic rate was used, which worked well in modeling prompt detonation of explosives of large size, {{but does not}} work on other aspects of explosive behavior. The variable-pressure Tarantula reactive flow rate model was developed with JWL++ in order to also describe failure and initiation, and we have moved this model into Linked CHEETAH. The model works by turning on only above a pressure threshold, where a slow turn-on creates initiation. At a higher pressure, the rate suddenly leaps to a large value over a small pressure range. A slowly failing cylinder will see a rapidly declining rate, which pushes it quickly into failure. At a high pressure, the <b>detonation</b> <b>rate</b> is constant.

40|$|Firstly, recently, {{there are}} a lot of {{techniques}} being demanded for complex process, various explosive initiation method and highly accurate control of detonation are needed. In this research, the metal foil explosion using high current is focused attention on the method to obtain linear or planate initiation easily, and the main evaluation of metal foil explosion to initiate explosive was conducted. The explosion power was evaluated by observing optically the underwater shock wave generated from the metal foil explosion. Secondly, in high energy explosive processing, there are several applications, such as shock compaction, explosive welding, food processing and explosive forming. In these explosive applications, a high sensitive explosive has been mainly used. The high sensitive explosive is so dangerous, since it can lead to explosion suddenly. So, for developing explosives, the safety is the most important thing as well as low manufacturing cost and explosive characteristics. In this work, we have focused on the initiation sensitivity of a solid explosive and performed numerical analysis of sympathetic detonation. The numerical analysis is calculated by LS-DYNA 3 D (commercial code). To understand the initiation reaction of an explosive, Lee-Tarver equation was used and impact detonation process was analyzed by ALE code. Configuration of simulation model is a quarter of circular cylinder. The donor type of explosive (SEP) was used as initiation explosive. When the donor explosive is exploded, a shock wave is generated and it propagates into PMMA, air and metallic layers in order. During passing through the layers, the shock wave is attenuated and finally, it has influence on the acceptor explosive, Comp. B. Here, we evaluate the initiation of acceptor explosive and discuss about <b>detonation</b> pressure, reactive <b>rate</b> of acceptor explosive and attenuation of impact pressure...|$|R
