2500|$|The hammers or [...] "stamps" [...] in a {{stamping}} mill {{consisted of}} vertical balks of timber, iron-shod at the bottom, which were lifted by cams {{attached to the}} waterwheel drive shaft, and repeatedly dropped onto the ore which lay on a block of granite known as a mortarstone. There were usually {{two or three of}} these stamps in a row, powered by the same drive and operating in sequence. At first this process operated on the dry ore, which was shovelled in and removed by hand. However, in a 16th-century innovation from Europe, the stamp heads were surrounded by a wooden box with a finely perforated grill at one end and the ore was washed into the box by a stream of water which also washed out the crushed ore once it was just fine enough to pass through the grill. This was a vast improvement over <b>dry</b> <b>stamping</b> because it was a continuous process that also stopped the production of unwanted very fine dust.|$|R
40|$|A {{machine was}} {{designed}} to pattern thin films of liquid by liquid embossing. 10 designs were prototyped and evaluated according to pattern transfer, alignment, and ability to emboss large area. The final design utilizes a PDMS stamp cast such that it seals an air cavity, which is then pressurized to slightly bow the stamp. The cavity is clear so alignment {{can be accomplished by}} optical feedback using a camera and microscope objective. The theory of liquid embossing is discussed. PDMS has a very high contact angle with most fluids and so it is able to clear liquid from channels approximately 5 [mu]m wide. The wettability of the substrate is modified after being in contact with PDMS so the liquid does not reflow into the channels. Sub-micron alignment between layers was achieved. Vector plots of runout between layers are given. Electrical yield was found to be 89 % and was not negatively correlated by stamp age up to 1000 <b>dry</b> <b>stamps.</b> The stamps were found to wear, but due to their conformal nature this did not affect pattern transfer.

50|$|As the {{population}} grew, {{the beginnings of}} what became one of Candelaria’s greatest difficulties became all too apparent: there was insufficient water locally to support any significant permanent population. Candelaria was what {{was known as a}} “dry camp”. A larger spring in the next valley over (nine miles away) supplied water to Candelaria, but the costs for transporting this water to the camp drove the price to the princely sum (at the time) of $1.00 per gallon. The nearby spring was only sufficient to supply the water needs of the town's populace; little to none could be spared for the use of milling and processing the ore from the mines. The stamp mill in Candelaria had to operate as a dry mill, which spread toxic dust throughout the area. Unlike other camps where a wet milling process was used, Candelaria miners suffered from an extremely high incidence of “miners consumption” (respiratory disease). Inhabitants of the area breathed in the fine particulate dust created by the <b>dry</b> <b>stamping</b> process, which brought about respiratory tract infections and diseases which often ended in death.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} late-Henrican polity through the archive and {{perspective}} of William Paget, Henry VIII's secretary {{at the end}} of his reign. Paget's papers as secretary (1543 - 1547), that form the basis of the thesis, are an extensive, unique and relatively under-used source. From this starting-point Paget's role as secretary is explored and he is revealed as the personal servant of the king, whose natural environment was the court. As such he was an influential source of counsel and perhaps the key patronage-broker at court. In this context Paget also had a significant influence over the operation of the <b>dry</b> <b>stamp</b> {{at the end of}} the reign. Equally, Paget's role in shaping the function of the secretary and his relations with the recently formed privy council was of considerable importance, providing the template for later Tudor secretaries. Diplomacy in the uncertain world of the 1540 s was one of Paget's primary concerns and his priorities can be seen as trying to provide security and stability for the realm. This is revealed not only in his 'Consultation' of August 1546 but also in his diplomacy with the French, the Schmalkaldic League and the Papacy. In this he sometimes found himself at odds with the king and leading a privy council united in a desire for peace. Politically Paget has traditionally been cast as an ambitious politique, the 'master of practices' and part of the earl of Hertford's reform party. Whilst acknowledging Paget's close relations with Hertford this thesis questions the factional interpretation of the last years of the reign and argues that the predominant concern of Paget and his fellow privy councillors was a peaceful succession in which unanimity rather than conflict was the key-note.

It is based on the use of an elastomeric stamp containing microfeatures to print proteins on the substrate of choice. The process can be subdivided into three parts. First, a silicon master is fabricated, which contains the microfeatures of interest. Once fabricated, the master can be used multiple times to make stamps. Masters with customized patterns can also be purchased commercially. Second, a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamp is fabricated. Unlike fabrication of the master, this step can be performed without specialized equipment. The PDMS stamp is inked with extracellular matrix proteins. Proteins are printed on a substrate (e. g., a tissue culture polystyrene dish or a glass coverslip covered with a thin layer of polystyrene). The nonprinted areas are back-filled with poly-L-lysine-polyethylene glycol, which renders them resistant to cell adhesion. The production of these micropatterned substrates can be completed in < 2 h. The third and final portion of the protocol describes the deposition of cells onto the micropatterned substrate. ### RELATED INFORMATION *Movie 1 illustrates many of the steps for performing microcontact printing as described in this protocol*. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Movie 1 **. A step-by-step illustration of preparation of an elastomeric stamp containing microfeatures, preparation of the substrate, and cell growth on the microfeatures. (Movie created by Nicolas Carpi.) ### MATERIALS **Reagents** 1. Acetone - AP 6000 adhesion promoter (Dow Chemical) - Cells of choice - Chlorotrimethylsilane - Culture medium, complete (DMEM or DMEM-F 12 containing 10 % fetal calf serum [FCS] and 1 % penicillin/streptomycin) - Developer (Clariant AZ 400 K) - Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (with calcium and magnesium; with phenol red) (PBS) - Ethanol - Fetal calf serum - Fibronectin (Sigma-Aldrich F 1141) (50 μg/mL in PBS) - Fixative (optional; see Step 33) - HEPES (10 mM, pH 7. 4) - Photoresist (Clariant AZ 4562) - PLL(20) -g-[3, 5]-PEG(2) (PLL-g-PEG; SurfaceSolutions) - Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) (Sylgard 184; Dow Corning) - Polystyrene (Acros Organics 178890250) - Toluene - Trypsin-EDTA or Versen EDTA ### Equipment 1. Adhesive tape or sonicator (see Step 12) - Argon (optional; see Step 25) - Beaker, plastic - Beaker, small - Centrifuge, tabletop - Coverslips, glass (24 × 24 mm) or tissue culture polystyrene dishes - *See the section on Substrate Preparation*. - Flasks, cell culture (75 -cm 2) - Forceps - Hot plate or oven preset to 100 °C - Incubator, humidified, 5 % CO 2 - Laminar flow hood - Mask aligner (e. g., Süss MicroTec MA 750) with a vacuum mask holder - *A simpler and much cheaper alternative can be made from a UV lamp (Delolux 03 S, 400 W) mounted with a 310 - to 460 -nm band pass filter and a custom-made vacuum mask holder*. - Microscope, inverted - Nitrogen gas (optional; see Steps 1, 7) - Optical mask (Delta Mask) - *The optical mask is a quartz plate coated with a chromium layer that has been etched to obtain the desired patterns of opaque and transparent regions. A file with the desired micropatterns must be provided to the manufacturer. If the micropattern features are greater than several tens of micrometers in their smallest dimension, a high-resolution plastic transparency can be used instead. The plastic transparency is less expensive but has limited spatial resolution*. - Ovens preset to 60 °C, 70 °C - Parafilm - Petri dish sealed with Parafilm (for storing the resist master and stamps) - Photoresist master - *If a master is not produced in-house, then purchase one from a commercial manufacturer (e. g., Biotray or Advance Reproductions Corporation). If the experiment does not require pattern resolution better than 10 μm, the mask may be ordered as an inexpensive transparency film from a number of companies (e. g., CAD/Art Services) *. - Pipettes - Plasma cleaner or UV/ozone cleaner (λ< 200 nm) (see Step 17) - Scalpel - Silicon wafer, 100 mm (e. g., MEMC Electronic Materials) or glass (borosilicate) wafer, 100 × 100 × 0. 175 mm (Schott D 263 T) - *The glass wafers are thinner but much cheaper*. - Spin coater (e. g., Laurell Technologies Corporation WS- 400 - 6 NPP-LITE) - Spoon, fork, or pipette, plastic (see Step 8) - Tissue (optional; see Step 15) - Tubes, 50 -mL culture - Tweezers - Ultrasonic bath - Vacuum desiccator - Video recorder (optional; see Step 33) ### METHOD **Fabrication of the Master** *This part requires specialized equipment and training; thus, it is best to fabricate the master in collaboration with a nanofabrication facility. However, a relatively simple lithography facility can be set up under a chemical hood. Fabrication of a master need only be done once, because it can be reused indefinitely to produce the elastomeric stamps. The desired photoresist master can also be purchased from companies that fabricate custom-made microstructured masters on demand*. *This protocol provides guidelines for the various parameters needed to fabricate a photoresist master. Details of this photolithography protocol, however, must be adapted to the specific needs of each laboratory (e. g., size of the microfeatures, distance between features, incubation times and temperatures). Note that the production of a master with microfeatures ranging from 1 μm to several hundred micrometers is a routine procedure in any microfabrication facility. The example in this protocol is best suited for features with a minimum dimension of 3 - 10 μm (but up to several tens of micrometers is okay) and a distance between features of < 50 μm. Figure 1 provides an illustration of the steps required to fabricate a photoresist master*. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 1 **. The steps involved in producing molds by photolithography. (Circled numbers correspond to numbered steps in the Method.) *Photoresist Layer Coating* 1. Clean the silicon or the glass wafer in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min in acetone. Dry it in a flow of filtered air or nitrogen. - Spin coat the wafer as follows: - i. Place the wafer on a spin coater. - ii. Cover the central half of the wafer’s surface with photoresist. - iii. Spin coat the photoresist onto the wafer at 500 rpm for 30 sec. - iv. Spin coat the photoresist onto the wafer at 2000 rpm for 30 sec. - v. Dry the wafer under a hood for 10 min. - *The photoresist will be ~ 5 μm in height, which is suitable for 4 - to 10 -μm-wide features. When using a different photoresist for smaller features, this spin-coating step will have to be modified*. - Bake the photoresist layer onto the wafer using either a hot plate or an oven for 1 min at 100 °C. Cool the wafer on the bench for ~ 15 min until it returns to room temperature. *Photoresist Lithography* 4. Place the photoresist layer and the optical mask into contact with one another on the mask aligner or on the custom-made vacuum mask holder. Illuminate with the UV lamp (UV power 45 mW/cm 2 at 365 nm) for 10 sec. 5. Dilute the stock developer using one part developer and four parts H 2 O. Develop the photoresist in diluted developer for 90 - 120 sec. Rinse the wafer in a distilled H 2 O bath, which stops the development process. Dry the resist master with a flow of filtered air. - *Because the photoresist used in this protocol is “positive,” the illuminated areas are dissolved in the developer, creating the microfeatures (a negative photoresist would yield the opposite result) *. - *Do not post-bake the master. During the development step, microfeatures can be observed through a microscope using reflected light. If the patterns have not been completely revealed, extend the development time. The UV illumination time, the developer concentration, and the development time in Steps 4 and 5 depend upon the resist used and on its thickness. It may be necessary to adjust these*. *Photoresist Master Surface Coating* 6. Silanize the resist master in order to prevent it from adhering to the PDMS during stamp fabrication. - i. Place the resist master into a vacuum desiccator along with a small beaker containing a few drops of chlorotrimethylsilane. - ii. Turn on the vacuum for 30 min to induce the formation of chlorotrimethylsilane vapors. - iii. Turn off the vacuum, keep the desiccator sealed, and let the resist master silanize overnight. 7. Place the resist master for 30 min in a 70 °C oven to complete the silanization. - *Store the resist master away from dust (a Petri dish sealed with Parafilm works well). Handle the master with care. Be careful not to touch the patterned area with anything that could scratch and destroy it (e. g., use forceps). Clean it only with pressurized air or nitrogen*. **Micropatterned Substrate Fabrication** *Fabrication of the elastomeric stamp and microcontact printing of the micropattern can be performed in any biology laboratory without the need for specialized equipment. Two substrates for micropatterning are presented: the glass coverslip, which ensures the best optical quality, and the tissue culture treated polystyrene dish. Because in most cases protein adhesion is better on oxidized polystyrene than on glass, glass coverslips must be coated with a thin layer of polystyrene before protein and cells are applied. On bare glass, cells have been observed to rip adherent proteins, like fibronectin, off the glass*. *Stamp Fabrication* *See Figure 2 for an overview of PDMS stamp production*. ![Figure 2]([URL] "Figure 2 ") **Figure 2 **. PDMS stamp production. 8. Combine PDMS and the curing agent (both are included in the Sylgard 184 kit) in a 10 : 1 ratio in a plastic beaker and mix thoroughly using a plastic spoon, fork, or pipette. This step will generate bubbles in the elastomer. 9. Degas the PDMS mixture under vacuum to remove all of the air bubbles. Alternatively, centrifuge the mixture for 5 min at 3000 rpm. - *Avoid an excessively strong vacuum, which can cause the mixture to spill out of the beaker*. 10. Cast a 5 -mm thick layer of degassed PDMS mixture onto the resist master. Cure it for 2 h in a 60 °C oven. 11. Gently peel off the PDMS layer. - *The microstructures can be seen at the surface of the PDMS layer when viewed through a microscope. See Troubleshooting*. 12. Using a microscope and transmitted light, locate the region of interest containing the desired micropattern geometries. With a scalpel, excise 1 -cm 2 stamps. Larger regions can be excised, but stamps larger than 1 cm 2 are not easy to handle. - *Store stamps in a closed container away from dust (a Petri dish sealed with Parafilm works well). Stamps can be kept for months before being used. Adhesive tape can be used to clean dusty stamps, although, for small features, it is better to use stamps that have been cleaned by sonication*. *Substrate Preparation* *See Figure 3 for an overview of preparation of a polystyrene-coated glass coverslip*. ![Figure 3]([URL] "Figure 3 ") **Figure 3 **. Preparation of a polystyrene-coated glass coverslip. *The substrate described here is a glass coverslip coated with polystyrene. A tissue culture polystyrene dish can also be used. A short plasma or UV/ozone activation step (if the equipment is available) will enhance protein adhesion and cell attachment (Van Kooten et al. 2004). Proteins can be covalently bound to one another on polystyrene using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethyl aminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (Grabarek and Gergely 1990). For a useful handbook on conjugation techniques, see Hermanson (2008) *. 13. Wash the glass coverslip with ethanol. Dry the coverslip with filtered air or let it dry in the hood. - *Sonicate the coverslip in ethanol to optimize dust removal*. 14. Spin coat the coverslip as follows: - i. Place the coverslip on the spin coater. - ii. Deposit a few drops of the adhesion promoter AP 6000 onto the glass. - iii. Spin coat the coverslip for 10 sec at 100 rpm (to cover the coverslip), then for 20 sec at 1000 rpm (to form a thin layer). - iv. Dry the AP 6000 layer. - *The adhesion promoter ensures that the polystyrene will attach to the glass*. 15. Coat with polystyrene as follows: - i. Prepare a solution of 2 % polystyrene solution in toluene (2 %) and place a few drops of it on the AP 6000 -treated coverslip. - ii. Spin coat for 10 sec at 100 rpm (to coat the coverslip), then for 20 sec at 1000 rpm (to form a thin layer of polystyrene). - iii. After the spin coating, dry the polystyrene layer. - *If a spin coater is not available for use in Steps 14 and 15, spread the drops manually by handling the coverslip with tweezers and displacing the drop with an orbital rotation of the coverslip. After coating the coverslip, remove excess liquid with a tissue. If this alternative method is used, reduce the polystyrene to 0. 5 % so that the polystyrene layer will not be too thick*. - *Glass coverslips covered with polystyrene can be stored at room temperature for days. Oxidation of the substrate (Step 17) should be carried out immediately before the substrate is stamped (Step 20) *. *Microcontact Printing* *See Figure 4 for an overview of stamping fibronectin and backfilling with PLL-g-PEG*. ![Figure 4]([URL] "Figure 4 ") **Figure 4 **. Stamping fibronectin and backfilling with PLL-g-PEG. 16. Place a 20 -μL drop of 50 μg/mL fibronectin in PBS onto the microstructured surface of a 1 -cm 2 stamp. Spread the fibronectin solution across the stamp surface with the tip of the pipette by moving it toward each corner of the stamp. Leave the inked stamp for ~ 30 min to allow the fibronectin to adsorb to the PDMS. - *Spreading the fibronectin is necessary because the PDMS is hydrophobic. The surface of the stamp can be gently touched without damaging it*. 17. Transfer the polystyrene-coated coverslip (from Step 15) into a plasma cleaner. Turn on the pump to create a vacuum in the chamber. Allow a low flow of oxygen into the chamber and apply an oscillating electric field at 30 W for 10 sec. - *Tissue culture polystyrene dish substrates can be printed on without plasma oxidation, but plasma treatment (as described here) significantly improves printing and passivation efficiencies. Polystyrene Petri dishes (not activated for tissue culture) can also be used, provided they are activated by plasma treatment*. - *Stamp oxidized substrates (Step 20) within 15 min of activating them*. - *Substrate activation can also be performed in a UV/ozone cleaner (λ < 200 nm) *. 18. Aspirate off the fibronectin drop and immediately add a large drop of PBS to the surface before it dries. Repeat the PBS wash two more times to remove all of the unadsorbed fibronectin. 19. Remove the PBS drop and let the stamp dry in the airflow of a hood (it will take from a few seconds up to 1 min). The stamp is ready for printing when the surface appears dry while looking at light reflecting from it. *See Troubleshooting*. 20. Grasp the <b>dry</b> <b>stamp</b> with tweezers, invert the stamp, and place the microstructured surface in contact with the activated substrate (from Step 17). Briefly apply gentle pressure with the tweezers to ensure good contact between the stamp and the substrate. Leave the stamp in contact with the substrate for 1 min. - *This step is absolutely critical for success and requires practice to achieve satisfactory results*. 21. Remove the stamp and immerse it into H 2 O in a 50 -mL culture tube. 22. Prepare 0. 1 mg/mL PLL-g-PEG solution in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7. 4). Immerse the printed substrate in this solution for 30 min. To minimize the amount of PLL-g-PEG used, place a 100 -μL drop on the substrate and cover it with a piece of Parafilm. - *The PLL-g-PEG renders the nonprinted areas resistant to cell adhesion. See Troubleshooting*. 23. During PLL-g-PEG adsorption, clean the stamp. Heat the culture tube containing the stamp at 60 °C and sonicate it in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min. Then sonicate the stamp in ethanol for 15 min. - *This cleaning procedure might not remove all the protein from the stamp. If another type of protein is to be stamped, it is better to use a new stamp*. 24. Dry the clean stamp under a hood for 1 h. Return the stamp to its storage container. 25. Wash the PLL-g-PEG-grafted substrate with PBS for 2 min and then for 10 min. - *The substrate is now ready for cell deposition. If not used immediately, it can be stored immersed in PBS or dried and stored under argon at 4 °C for up to 1 wk*. **Cell Deposition** *Micropatterned substrates prepared using this protocol have been used successfully with the following cells: HeLa-B, RPE 1, MCF 10 A, MCF 7, NIH 3 T 3, HepaRG, MDCK, and human mesenchymal stem cells, as well as dendritic cells derived from murine bone marrow*. 26. Wash adherent cells in PBS. Detach the cells with trypsin-EDTA (for 5 - 10 min, depending on the dilution used) or Versen EDTA. 27. Add complete culture medium to the flask and collect the cells by centrifugation for 3 min at 1500 rpm. 28. Remove the supernatant and resuspend the cells in complete culture medium at 50, 000 cells/mL. 29. Add the cell solution to the micropatterned substrate (from Step 25). The final cell density should be ~ 10, 000 cells/cm 2. Place the cell-covered substrate into a tissue culture incubator. - *The incubation time depends upon the cell line (e. g., 15 - 30 min for RPE 1 and 30 - 60 min for HeLa-B) *. 30. Check the cells under a microscope to determine if a sufficiently large proportion of cells have attached to the micropatterns. 31. Remove unattached cells with a gentle flow of medium added to one side of the dish and aspirated from the other side. - *Keep the cells moist; do not allow them to become exposed to the air. The physicochemical properties of PEG can cause dewetting, leading the attached cells to quickly dry out*. 32. Return the attached cells to the incubator. Let them spread fully (1 - 5 h, depending on the cell type). 33. Fix or video-record the cells. *See Figure 5 for examples of cells attached to micropatterns*. ![Figure 5]([URL] "Figure 5 ") **Figure 5 **. Images of cells on micropatterns.

Scale bar, 100 μm. ### TROUBLESHOOTING 1. **Problem**: Separating the PDMS layer from the photoresist master destroys the master. **[Step 11]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Curing the PDMS mixture (Step 10) for more than 2 h at 60 °C can induce PDMS binding to the photoresist, which weakens the resist layer and results in destruction of the photoresist master when the two layers are separated. Avoid curing for more than 2 h. - 2. Silanization of the resist master (Steps 6 and 7) might have failed. This will result in strong binding of the cured PDMS to the master. Before making a new master, check on a blank one that the silane used for the coating is still functional. Silanes tend to degrade, and the silane solution should be renewed regularly. - **Problem**: Salt crystals form on the surface of the elastomeric stamp as the PBS dries. **[Step 19]** - **Solution**: This may happen if an excess of PBS is left to dry on the stamp. Avoid this by washing the stamp once with H 2 O before drying. - **Problem**: The polystyrene layer detaches and floats at the surface when the coverslip is placed in aqueous solution. **[Step 22]** - **Solution**: Consider the following: - 1. Treat the coverslip with adhesion promoter (Step 14) prior to applying the polystyrene. - 2. Affix the polystyrene to the coverslip by placing the polystyrene-coated coverslip under a UV lamp for 5 min at λ = 185 nm and 4 × 60 W (Yan and Harnish 2003). - **Problem**: Cells do not grow uniformly and/or they grow significantly beyond the boundaries of the microfeatures. **[Step 33]** - **Solution**: Consider the following when stamping the substrate in Step 20 : - 1. Insufficient pressure might result in poor printing. Apply pressure with the tweezers both uniformly and for a longer period of time. - 2. Excessive pressure will induce sagging of the stamp, causing proteins to print outside of the features. Apply pressure more gently. - 3. Do not move the stamp once it has touched the surface. Both application and removal of the stamp should be done with precision and great care. ### DISCUSSION Microfabrication techniques as applied to cell biology now have a long and successful history (see Folch and Toner [2000] and Whitesides et al. [2001] for reviews of many micropatterning techniques developed from the 1970 s to the 1990 s). Accompanying the rapid development of biological applications (in cell biology, tissue engineering, cell co-cultures, bioassays, and biosensors, among other fields), there has been a huge burst of technical papers in the last 10 years that expand the utility of micropatterning techniques to new substrates (glass, plastics, hydrogels, and elastomers), additional molecules, cell types, and into three dimensions. There are many alternative techniques, but five main processes dominate the field of micropatterning: 1.

50|$|Shrinkage is a {{characteristic}} of paper {{because of the nature}} of cellulose fibers. The cellulose fiber is hygroscopic and acts like a sponge when immersed in water. The fibers expand in their width and not in their length. With handmade paper, because there is no direction associated with the fibers, the paper expands and shrinks unevenly in both the length and width of the finished sheet. With machine-made paper, because there is a direction to the fibers, the paper shrinks unevenly, that is, less in its length (in the direction of the fibers) and more in its width (in the direction opposite of the fibers). This characteristic is important to the printer because certain printing techniques required the paper to be dampened prior to printing. As such, when the paper dried, the uneven shrinkage of machine-made paper would produce an image of different proportions than the die that created it. The differences in appearance between wet and <b>dry</b> printed <b>stamps</b> can sometimes be quite noticeable, with <b>dry</b> printed <b>stamps</b> generally having sharper images on stiffer and thicker paper.|$|R

These materials are extremely attractive for use in fast-flexible-electronic, optoelectronic, and nanophotonic applications. This broad potential derives from the unique properties imparted by the membranes' thinness relative to silicon wafers, including robustness, flexibility, and bondability. The structures can also be strain engineered to enhance individual electronic and mechanical properties or to produce unique tubular and helical nanostructures [2 – 6]. Successful integration of these structures into next-generation devices will require new paradigms for their assembly.

In particular the reported procedures are oriented towards the tools fabrication for lithographically controlled wetting and soft lithography. Because the versatility of these methods that has almost no restrictions concerning the materials used for the stamps, {{a wide range of}} methods are provided in this protocol including photolithography, electron beam lithography, replica molding, laser engraving and nanoimprinting. ### Introduction **GENERAL INFORMATION** **PHOTOLITHOGRAPHY** Presently the most common method to fabricate rigid stamps (usually in silicon) and masters required for replica molding of the soft stamps is photolithography (see the protocol in ref. (1)). This process, widely used for microfabrication, is based on the selective removing of parts of a film upon the exposition to light (usually UV). This is achieved thanks to some materials known as photoresists, that are light-sensitive, meaning that, according to their composition, they become soluble or insoluble to their developing solution upon illumination. The first family is called positive photoresist and the second negative. The light is sent through a photomask that shadows the parts of the film that, according to the kind of resist used, must be removed or preserved. Different kind of masks can be used but their common feature is the ability to shadow as much as possible some parts of the photoresist below (contrasting power), the most used are transparent foils with pattern drawn by an ink non-transparent to UV-light or highly reflecting foils (usually metallic) where some portion have been removed by laser engraving. The current limits of photolithography is approximately 250 nm and the minimum feature size is 100 nm (2). These values are important on the one hand to define the ranges of fabrication of soft stamps for LCW {{but on the other hand}} for the forthcoming comparison with the feature sizes and resolution that LCW can achieve. The masks are usually drawn using CAD software and then transferred either by common printers on transparent foils, where the marks will represent the shadowed areas, or by laser engraving of highly reflective metallic sheets where the removed part will corresponding to the illuminated path. The photoresist film, upon illumination is then developed in the appropriate solution leaving on the surface only the features that will be used as master for replica molding or directly as stamp. **ELECTRON BEAM LITHOGRAPHY** When the resolution limits required by the process are below those of photolithography (diffraction limit), electron beam lithography (EBL) is usually chosen for fabricating the masters. This technique is in fact able to achieve resolution of 20 - 30 nm in lateral size (see the protocol in ref. (1)), because it make use of an electron beam to locally alter the chemical properties of a material (resist) that will be then removed in a development step. Beside the illustrated resolution advantage one must remind that EBL is an expensive technology and it is a serial technique, thus it is much slower than photolithography. **REPLICA MOLDING** Replica molding (RM) is the most common way of fabricating the elastomeric stamp for soft lithography and LCW and it is one of the most important tools for these techniques. RM is based on the reticulation of the elastomeric precursors onto the master that is then removed, upon curing, by peeling it off. It is worth mentioning that the LCW is not limited to the elastomeric materials as other soft-lithographic methods and it makes wide use of rigid and metallic materials as it is shown other sections of this protocol. Nevertheless replica molding of the elastomeric materials still plays a crucial role because, making use of well known materials such as Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), it allows tuning the surface properties of the stamp by liquid or plasma chemical treatments. Elastomeric stamps made of PDMS are deformed easily under the effect of capillary adhesion. The attractive force, exerted by the solution trapped between the substrate and the stamp, may involve sagging of the PDMS stamp and poor patterning in the region where the PDMS displaced the solution. The capillary force may be estimated according to De Gennes,(3) and needs to be considered during the design of the spacer and the dimensioning of the full PDMS replica. In this case, an effective parameter is the aspect ratio AR, defined as the ratio of width over thickness of the window delimited by the spacer. If we put PDMS Young modulus E ≈ 460 kPa, contact angle of solution θ = π/ 6, and surface tension γ = 0. 02 N/m (organic solvents), we derived the critical value for AR that will induce sagging for various distances between the substrate and the PDMS replica, by finite element calculation (Figure 1). The empirical relationship can be summarized with a linear abacus for fast design, providing that the overall dimension of the stamp is exceeding the window defined by the spacer. **NANOIMPRINT LITHOGRAPHY** Nanoimprint lithography (NIL) is another important technique useful to fabricate tools (i. e. master for RM and stamps) for LCW. NIL consists of a physical (morphological) deformation of a thermoplastic material in a temperature and pressure controlled printing process. A silicon stamp fabricated by a conventional lithography such as EBL or photolithography is usually employed. In NIL the thermoplastic material (usually a polymer) is deformed by pressing the stamp into the polymer at a temperature above the polymer’s glass-transition temperature. The polymer is then cooled down below the glass-transition temperature and the stamp is removed. **VACUUM SUBLIMATION OF METALS** One of the advantages of LCW is the versatility with respect to the material of the stamp used for patterning. In this frame, a role is played also by metallic stamps, some of them (gold for instance) can be functionalized using thiol based Self Assembled Monolayers (SAM) to tune their surface properties. These stamps are usually fabricated by vacuum sublimation of a thin metallic layer on a master previously realized by one of the above mentioned techniques. For some substrates such as silicon or mica an adhesive layer (usually made of chromium or titanium) has to be previously evaporated on the underlying material to favour the stability of the metallic film. **COMMERCIAL AVAILABLE MASTER/STAMPS** Commercial metallic grids commonly used for Electron Microscopy experiments have proven to be very suitable for as a stamp for LCW (See Fig 2). When the grid comes as a large sheet that must be cut, it is crucial to cut it with very sharp scissors to avoid large deformations of the areas near the cut. For the most kind of patterning inexpensive masters such as Compact Disc (CD) Digital versatile disk (DVD) or diffraction gratings are commercially available. This kind of devices are made of: Blank CD, parallel stripes 1. 5 µm pitch, 500 nm width and 220 nm depth. Blank DVD, parallel stripes with 750 µm pitch, 300 nm width and 110 nm depth. Written disks contain a pattern o doth and line with the same size containing an information in digital (binary) code. Figure 3 shows typical AFM images CD and DVD masters. ### Reagents 1.
