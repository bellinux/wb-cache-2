This study received approval from the Hanover College Institutional Review Board with regard to the use of human subjects. Methods: Twenty male subjects volunteered to participate.

Mean peak plasma concentrations of BTS 67 582 were 518, 1076 and 2435 ng ml- 1 for doses of 125, 250 and 500 mg, respectively. Mean maximum reductions in <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> were 1. 13, 1. 59 and 1. 78 mmol l- 1, and mean maximum increases in plasma insulin were 26, 14 and 21 muu ml- 1 {{for the three}} doses, respectively. Changes in incremental area under the curve (AUC) of <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> were correlated with changes in plasma BTS 67 582 AUC. The maximum reduction in <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> was correlated with the peak plasma BTS 67 582 concentration. No correlations between plasma insulin and plasma BTS 67 582 concentrations were observed. Anticlockwise hysteresis was evident in concentration-effect curves, but less evident following subtraction of placebo data, and was mainly due to an underlying downward trend in <b>fasted</b> <b>blood</b> <b>glucose</b> levels with time evident under placebo treatment.
