5|$|Although {{players had}} {{previously}} recorded segments of gameplay, these were usually deathmatches or speedruns, attempts {{to complete a}} map as quickly as possible. Diary of a Camper was the first demo to contain a narrative with text-based dialogue, instead of merely showing gameplay. Commentators <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> work primitive, but acknowledge its importance in establishing video games as a medium for filmmaking.|$|E
5|$|Some Vaishnava {{literature}} reverentially link Shiva to {{characters in}} its mythologies. For example, in the Hanuman Chalisa, Hanuman {{is identified as}} the eleventh avatar of Shiva.

5|$|Las Casas's legacy {{has been}} highly controversial. In the years {{following}} his death his ideas became taboo in the Spanish realm, and he {{was seen as a}} nearly heretical extremist; the accounts written by his enemies Lopez de Gómara and Oviedo were widely read and published. As the British empire rose to power and hostilities between the British and Spanish began, the British used Las Casas's accounts of Spanish cruelty as a political tool making it part of the foundation of what Spanish nationalists <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Black Legend, the tendency of historians to slander Spain for its imperial past, while looking mildly at the same undertakings by others such as the British.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–05 {{lock-out}} {{ensured that}} several players {{who would otherwise}} have been playing in the NHL, including Getzlaf, were available to return to the national team for the 2005 World Junior Championship.

With 12 points in 6 games, Getzlaf finished second in overall scoring to teammate Patrice Bergeron's 13. He scored one goal and added two assists in the championship game against Russia as the Canadians won the gold medal by a 6–1 score; it was the nation's first title in eight years at the event.|$|E

25|$|The Juhu airport {{redevelopment}} plan, {{that received}} an in-principle nod from the State Government on 5 April 2013, involves closing down its secondary runway 16/34. Aviation experts <b>have</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> re-development blueprint most unsafe as {{closing of the}} secondary runway at Juhu would mean the airport would have to shut operations whenever CSIA uses its secondary runway 14/32. The use of Juhu's main runway while CSIA's secondary runway is in use will cause aircraft paths to intersect risking air safety. Airlines would be averse to operating from an airport which would either violate safety norms or be shut almost 40% of the time.|$|E
