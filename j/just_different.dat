5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact <b>just</b> <b>different</b> limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{concept of}} the schizoid character developed by Ernst Kretschmer comprised an amalgamation of avoidant, schizotypal and schizoid traits. It was not until 1980 and the influential work of Theodore Millon {{which led to the}} split of the schizoid character into three distinct personality disorders (now schizoid, schizotypal and avoidant). Since then however, there has been much debate about whether that is accurate or if these traits are <b>just</b> <b>different</b> expressions of one overarching personality disorder and belong together.|$|E

25|$|Entropy is {{a measure}} of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average {{information}} content. To get an intuitive understanding of these terms, consider the example of a political poll. Usually, such polls happen because the outcome of the poll is not already known. In other words, the outcome of the poll is relatively unpredictable, and actually performing the poll and learning the results gives some new information; these are <b>just</b> <b>different</b> ways of saying that the a priori entropy of the poll results is large. Now, consider the case that the same poll is performed a second time shortly after the first poll. Since the result of the first poll is already known, the outcome of the second poll can be predicted well and the results should not contain much new information; in this case the a priori entropy of the second poll result is small relative to that of the first.|$|E

Stewart criticized Comedy Central's decision to alter the episode, while simultaneously acknowledging they likely did so to protect their employees from [...] "possible harmful repercussions". Bill Maher, host of the HBO talk show Real Time with Bill Maher, said the threats against [...] "201" [...] demonstrated {{the importance of the}} First Amendment and other American civil liberties, and said, [...] "When South Park got threatened last week by Islamists incensed at their depiction of Muhammad, it served—or should serve—as a reminder that our culture isn't <b>just</b> <b>different</b> than one that makes death threats to cartoonists. It's better." [...] He added jokingly, [...] "If you don't get that, and you still want to kill someone over a stupid cartoon, please make it Garfield." ...|$|E

500|$|Though {{some critics}} {{appreciated}} how Fringe chose {{to end the}} finale with {{a shot of the}} World Trade Center, others disliked it. Jeff Pinkner defended their decision by explaining they chose it because the building is [...] "obviously very iconic" [...] and it best displayed that in the parallel universe, [...] "things are both better and in some ways worse. It's <b>just</b> <b>different</b> choices, the road not taken". Leonard Nimoy also defended the writers, commenting that when he received the script, he thought it [...] "was very interesting and really kind of daring contemporary television to pull in that story... You know, it's not easy to use that kind of stuff without seeming somehow exploitive. But I thought they did it very, very well". Many critics expressed that because of the episode, they couldn't wait for the following season to begin. IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 9.2/10, while website blogger io9 listed [...] "There's More Than One of Everything" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to get into the show.|$|E
500|$|In {{regards to}} the miniseries' cynosural song [...] "Everything Stays", Nyström {{revealed}} that, during the storyboarding of the episode of the same name, she found herself unable to write a lullaby for the scene between Marceline and her mother. She relayed her issue to Muto, who contacted Sugar {{and asked if she}} would be willing to pen the song. Sugar agreed and based the song on an incident in which she lost a stuffed animal in a garden. A year later, she found it; the sun had bleached the exposed surfaces, but the underside was still the same. She explained, [...] " [...] wasn’t better, or worse, <b>just</b> <b>different.</b> It was the first time I realized that things will change no matter what, even if they’re left alone, and stay completely still." [...] Muto was excited to have Sugar return to work on the show, and noted at the 2015 Adventure Time San Diego Comic-Con International panel that [...] "because [...] was a Marceline miniseries, it wouldn't really feel complete unless Rebecca Sugar wrote a song for it." [...] At San Diego Comic-Con, Sugar and Olson performed the song live.|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{incorporated}} utopian {{themes in}} his previous works but reviewers were divided on whether The Years of Rice and Salt qualified as a utopian story. Those that did call the world described in the story as utopian cited the story's illustration of progress. However, those that wrote The Years of Rice and Salt was not a utopian story say that the world history presented is not necessarily better or worse than the real history, <b>just</b> <b>different.</b> Robinson calls himself a [...] "utopian novelist" [...] in that he claims [...] "all science fiction has a utopian element, in that it tends to say that what we do now matters and will have consequences". Several other themes were identified by reviewers. Robinson had previously used the theme of memory (or identity) and incorporates it into this story with characters who are reincarnated versions of previous characters and who only recognize each other while in the bardo, but sometimes feel a connection between themselves while on earth. The reviewer in The Globe and Mail identified feminism and [...] "struggles over the nature of Islam" [...] as recurring themes.|$|E

500|$|According to CNN, {{he became}} a drug dealer and used the Bible that his {{grandmother}} gave him as a good luck charm. After being arrested for drug possession, the officer saw the Bible and let Lecrae go on a promise that he would agree to live by it. He eventually turned from drugs to alcohol consumption and a party lifestyle and became a [...] "misfit of a person." [...] He has described himself during this period as a thrill-seeker, he would pull stunts such as jumping from a third-story building, and gained the nickname [...] "Crazy 'Crae". Encouraged by his concerned mother to read his Bible, Lecrae said that [...] "I remember ripping the pages out of the Bible and throwing it on the floor. I don't want this Bible. I couldn't wrap my hands around this being true or real." [...] He began to drink and smoke more and look for more women [...] "as the emptiness became more profound." [...] At age 17, his personal, financial, and relationship troubles convinced {{him that he was}} at a [...] "dead end." [...] Wanting to do what he considered the mature thing, through the influence of his grandmother, he desired to start attending church. A girl Lecrae attended high school with was there, and she invited him to a Bible study, where he met Darragh, his future wife. Lecrae {{was surprised to find that}} the members of the Bible study [...] "were just people like me. [...] They read the same books and listened to the same music. Their character was <b>just</b> <b>different.</b> They were loving and that's really what drew me in." [...] Lecrae says that it was at age 19 that he finally decided to live for God, though [...] "it wasn't overnight" [...] and he [...] "spent a lot of time making bad decisions." ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{ideas for}} The Altar and the Door were {{inspired}} roughly eighteen {{months before the}} album's release. Lead vocalist Mark Hall and his co-youth pastor were encouraged by one of their students to look at MySpace. According to Hall, “It wasn’t any major surprise, but we did {{see a lot of}} kids who had two worlds going on. MySpace can be Spring Break for the brain, this place you can go and not think anyone’s ever going to find out. Kids would be listed as Christians and then show their porn star name or what kind of kisser they are. They were just presenting so many contradictions on one page. The temptation was to just get upset and think that’s terrible. But MySpace isn’t really a big problem– it’s just revealing what the problem is". He noted that this situation isn't unique to teenagers and that while at church [...] "we [...] want to serve [...] " [...] but when [...] "we get out there in the world... it’s <b>just</b> <b>different.</b> We want to be accepted; we want friends. The compromises start coming in small little increments until you’re just kind of out there. Church becomes more of a guilt activator than a place to go to be with the Lord. It’s a nasty place to live, and we all live there". Hall says that [...] "When we’re at the altar, everything’s clear, and it all makes perfect sense, and we know how to live. We know what’s right and what’s wrong. The struggle is getting this life at the altar out the door... That’s the problem; we’re finding ourselves somewhere in the middle". Hall elaborated in a separate interview that [...] "Somewhere between the altar and the door, it all leaks out and I'm out here wondering what to do, rationalising things instead of living the life that's in me. So the struggle that we have as believers is trying to get those truths (that are) in our heads and highlighted in our Bibles out to our hands and feet. The songs are all the things that happen in the middle of that". Although Hall says that he [...] "always think lyrics first", he felt that [...] "Once we [...] got into the recording I knew we were in for something different, a more progressive approach to the music. These songs sounded different in my head; they've been a big challenge for us as a band. And the music definitely sets the tone for the whole project".|$|E
