Therefore, the research question seeks to understand which <b>discourse</b> <b>strategies</b> will help to convey the knowledge and allow the students to build upon domain-specific competencies as well as start and evaluate self-guided learning processes. In this perspective, the paper will first investigate which communicative situations have to be mastered in professional settings linked with the German speaking area, which potential addressees and functions {{are supposed to be}} relevant, which text-/discourse-types will be used. The related <b>discourse</b> <b>strategies</b> for information as well as for argumentation or persuasion purposes will be analyzed, by taking in account their fitting corporate and/or political communication. As for the analysis of <b>discourse</b> <b>strategies</b> apt to foster the learning process the following issues will be unfolded: considering that the embedding of the German course for special purposes allows to reach at the curriculum’s end the B 1 -B 2 level defined by the European Common Framework of Reference, which professional features/ competencies can be realised? How can students be induced to detect transfer difficulties related to intercultural diversity? How can <b>discourse</b> <b>strategies</b> suited to handle with these difficulties be taught...|$|R
50|$|Intertextuality is {{the shaping}} of a text's meaning by another text. Intertextual figures include: allusion, quotation, calque, plagiarism, translation, {{pastiche}} and parody. Intertextuality is a literary device that creates an 'interrelationship between texts' and generates related understanding in separate works ("Intertextuality", 2015). These references are made to influence the reader and add layers of depth to a text, based on the readers' prior knowledge and understanding. Intertextuality is a literary <b>discourse</b> <b>strategy</b> (Gadavanij, n.d.) utilised by writers in novels, poetry, theatre and even in non-written texts (such as performances and digital media). Examples of intertextuality are an author's borrowing and transformation of a prior text, and a reader's referencing of one text in reading another.|$|E

Two examples of <b>discourse</b> <b>strategies</b> are outlined: the use of articulation to position a desired outcome within a historically resonant discourse in order to gain legitimacy; and the maintenance of a strategic tension between isomorphism and differentiation such that a stance is perceived as a credible choice.

This research applies research method of qualitative-interpretative based on discourse analytical method Theo Van Leeuwen to script news about backward demand to head leader PSSI NURDIN HALID broadcasted by radio Citra Malang with period broadcasts February-April 2008. This discourse analytical method consisted of process exclusion and inclusion. At process, exclusion there are some strategies that is first of passives that is strategy eliminates actor or subject by the way of changing active sentence become passive. Both nominalizations that are <b>discourse</b> <b>strategy</b> done by changing vb. (verbal) become noun (nominal). Generally is done by giving augmentation pe-an. Third, commutation of clause that {{is at the same time}} do duty off actor. At process inclusion there are some kinds of discourse strategies done that is, firstly, differences-indifferences that is strategy presenting an event or an social actor in text self-supporting, as an unique event and typically, but poison also is made contrast by presenting event or group or other actor in text. Second, objectives-abstracts that is element of discourse, is an event or social actor is present by giving concrete guide or presented is abstraction. Third, nomination-categorization that is strategy that with reference to choice, is the actor presented as it is or so-called is category from the social actor [...] Fourth, nomination-identification that is <b>discourse</b> <b>strategy</b> about how a group, event or certain action is defines. Fifth, determinacy-indeterminacy that is <b>discourse</b> <b>strategy</b> concerning whether actor or event of mentioned in explains or no (anonym). Sixth, assimilation-individualization that is <b>discourse</b> <b>strategy</b> relating to question is social actor reported on fetched out its category or no. Seventh, association-disassociation, that is <b>discourse</b> <b>strategy</b> relating to question, is actor, a party presented self, or it is attribute to other group larger ones. Result from this research indicates that script the news applies process exclusion and inclusion. Process exclusion applied is replacement strategy of clause that is adding clause to disappear actor or subject in news sentence. Other strategy that is passives and nominalization not founded in script. While processing inclusion or strategy to peep out actor or subject in news done by news writer by using some strategies, firstly, strategy is differentiation-indifferentiation that is presenting of actor Geoff Thompson Vice President FIFA to strengthen backward pressure for Head Leader PSSI NURDIN HALID. Second, that is strategy objectivities-abstract by mentioning sentence "outside party" to change word “government of respected state". Third, nomination-categorization strategy peeped out in this script by mentioning name of Nurdin Halid is being stumbling corruption problem. Fourth, strategy nomination-identification is done by adding sentence “now resides in Salemba" to give additional explanation to Nurdin Halid. Fifth, that is strategy determination-indetermination, done by mentioning word “staff its expert" to change actor who is giving information coming from Menpora. Sixth, change name Indonesia League Nugroho Swasto Manager PSIM Yogyakarta to.

I propose modifications to Douglas Walton 2 ̆ 7 s position in Scare Tactics: Arguments that Appeal to Fear and Threats that will help improve assessment of fear appeals in complex argumentation such as political discourse. Walton has argued for attending to the underlying practical inference structure involved in fear appeals as well as the type of dialogue in which they occur.

The combination of an orators understanding of apologia, kategoria, and image repair theory are like a warriors sword and shield. It enables an orator to deflect what ought to be deflected and attack what ought to be attacked when the goal is to repair one 2 ̆ 7 s image.

It {{is based}} on the naturally-occurring conversations of twenty-one Taiwanese participants and their foreign spouses, and aims at providing {{a better understanding of how}} different strategies are deployed to mitigate or intensify their propositions in disagreement contexts. Through a detailed interactional sociolinguistics analysis of the negotiation between the couples, it is demonstrated that disagreement cultivates the intimate relationship between participants from different languages and cultures. <b>Discourse</b> <b>strategies,</b> such as vocatives, the discourse marker well, apology and complaint can be used to indicate upcoming oppositions, whereas questioning, swearing, reference to nationality, humour, and indirectness are used to maintain the disagreement. I employ the theory of stance-taking as a framework to elucidate how numerous <b>discourse</b> <b>strategies</b> are related to disagreement. A sequential analysis of stances demonstrates that multilingual intercultural couples may choose different languages to index their identities, attitudes, and beliefs and highlight disagreement. Code-switching functions as one of the most readily available strategies that the couples draw on to express their affective and epistemic stances, which strengthens the salience of constructing and negotiating their oppositions during the interaction. It argues that disagreement strategies are highly idiosyncratic rather than culture-specific. The fact that multilingual couples’ disagreement commonly terminates without consensus supports the main argument that sustaining oppositional stances does not damage their relationship...|$|R
