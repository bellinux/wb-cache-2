The three main types identified include intra-patera, flow-dominated, and explosion-dominated eruptions.

50|$|As the <b>imaging</b> <b>infrared</b> seeker and the {{television}} seeker are significantly smaller than the radar seeker, the manufacturer has {{taken advantage of the}} extra space to develop a variety of combined seekers for dual guidance, which include: radar and <b>imaging</b> <b>infrared</b> guidance, television and <b>imaging</b> <b>infrared</b> guidance, dual band (<b>infrared</b> and <b>imaging</b> <b>infrared)</b> guidance, and television and infrared guidance. These combined seekers can also be fitted at naval bases.

The Tornado ECR is devoted to Suppression of Enemy Air Defences (SEAD) missions, operated by Germany and Italy. The Tornado ECR is equipped with an emitter-locator system (ELS) to spot radar use. German ECRs have a Honeywell <b>infrared</b> <b>imaging</b> system for reconnaissance flights. RAF and RSAF Tornados have the Laser Range Finder and Marked Target Seekers (LRMTS) for targeting laser-guided munitions. In 1991, the RAF introduced TIALD, allowing Tornado GR1s to laser-designate their own targets.|$|E
5|$|Deciding between {{building}} ground- versus space-based telescopes is complex. Even before Hubble was launched, specialized ground-based {{techniques such}} as aperture masking interferometry had obtained higher-resolution optical and infrared images than Hubble would achieve, though restricted to targets about 108 times brighter than the faintest targets observed by Hubble. Since then, advances in adaptive optics have extended the high-resolution imaging capabilities of ground-based telescopes to the <b>infrared</b> <b>imaging</b> of faint objects. The usefulness of adaptive optics versus HST observations depends strongly on the particular details of the research questions being asked. In the visible bands, adaptive optics can only correct a relatively small field of view, whereas HST can conduct high-resolution optical imaging over a wide field. Only {{a small fraction of}} astronomical objects are accessible to high-resolution ground-based imaging; in contrast Hubble can perform high-resolution observations of any part of the night sky, and on objects that are extremely faint.|$|E

40|$|A {{recurrent}} {{problem in}} the assessment of thermal injuries is the ability to accurately identify the depth and extent of injury. Generally, the depth of a burn injury determines and is inversely related to the ability of the skin to restore and regenerate itself. Burns involve damage to the dermis in varying amounts, reducing the dermal blood supply and altering the skin hemodynamics. Near <b>infrared</b> spectroscopic <b>imaging</b> was used to non-invasively assess the changes that occur in the early (1 - 3 h) post-burn period. The study used an accurate porcine model to investigate the potential of near <b>infrared</b> spectroscopic <b>imaging</b> to accurately distinguish between burns of varying severity. Data analysis was carried out using a two-way and three-way data decompositions techniques to investigate the spectral changes related to burns. Burn injuries drastically alter the physical and optical properties of the tissue. Thermal destruction of cutaneous vasculature disrupts perfusion and oxygen delivery to the affected tissue. The results demonstrated that near <b>infrared</b> spectroscopic <b>imaging</b> might provide a new tool for an objective clinical assessment of burn injuries.

25|$|Beginning in 1993, the United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration used digital <b>infrared</b> <b>imaging</b> {{technology}} to produce photographs of Dead Sea Scrolls fragments. In {{partnership with the}} Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center and West Semitic Research, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory successfully worked to expand {{on the use of}} infrared photography previously used to evaluate ancient manuscripts by expanding the range of spectra at which images are photographed. NASA used this multi-spectral imaging technique, adapted from its remote sensing and planetary probes, in order to reveal previously illegible text on fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls. The process uses a liquid crystal tunable filter in order to photograph the scrolls at specific wavelengths of light and, as a result, image distortion is significantly diminished. This method was used with select fragments of the Dead Sea Scrolls to reveal text and details that cameras that take photographs using a larger light spectrum could not reveal. The camera and digital imaging assembly was developed specifically for the purpose of photographing illegible ancient texts.|$|E
500|$|Astronomers in the 1970s {{saw some}} major {{advances}} in astronomical imaging technology beginning with Antoine Labeyrie's invention of speckle interferometry, {{a process that}} significantly reduced the blurring effect caused by astronomical seeing. It increased the optical resolution of ground-based telescopes, allowing for more precise measurements of Betelgeuse's photosphere. With improvements in infrared telescopy atop Mount Wilson, Mount Locke and Mauna Kea in Hawaii, astrophysicists began peering into the complex circumstellar shells surrounding the supergiant, causing them to suspect the presence of huge gas bubbles resulting from convection. [...] But {{it was not until}} the late 1980s and early 1990s, when Betelgeuse became a regular target for aperture masking interferometry, that breakthroughs occurred in visible-light and <b>infrared</b> <b>imaging.</b> Pioneered by John E. Baldwin and colleagues of the Cavendish Astrophysics Group, the new technique employed a small mask with several holes in the telescope pupil plane, converting the aperture into an ad-hoc interferometric array. [...] The technique contributed some of the most accurate measurements of Betelgeuse while revealing bright spots on the star's photosphere. These were the first optical and infrared images of a stellar disk other than the Sun, taken first from ground-based interferometers and later from higher-resolution observations of the COAST telescope. The [...] "bright patches" [...] or [...] "hotspots" [...] observed with these instruments appeared to corroborate a theory put forth by Schwarzschild decades earlier of massive convection cells dominating the stellar surface.|$|E
