An initial version of the album with 13 tracks was tracked {{at the end of}} April 2015, however, the creative process continued when additional songs were written and recorded for the album. Numerous delays pushed the recording and production of the album well into 2015, despite an open declaration early in that year, by Mandagi, that the album would be soon completed. By then, the band had collaborated with European producer Pascal Gabriel, co-writer and producer of various Marina and the Diamonds and Goldfrapp tracks, British songwriter and producer Justin Parker, known for his work with American recording artist Lana Del Rey, and American producer Ben H. Allen, who had previously produced albums for art rock acts Animal Collective and Deerhunter. Ultimately, in October 2015, 32 months after the band started production, amassing over 40 song ideas in the process, the album's production entered the audio mixing phase. Mandagi expressed dissatisfaction with the album's lengthy recording process, though insisted that he and the band were, in contrast, satisfied with the outcome and the final product, stating, [...] "sometimes it was ok, sometimes it was a bit trying but you know nothing good comes easy we just had to <b>keep</b> <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> We didn't put it out until it was right, 'til we felt right." ...|$|E

'It's no matter,' said Mr Pancks, 'I merely wish {{to remark}} {{that the task}} this Proprietor has set me, has been never to leave off conjugating the Imperative Mood Present Tense of the verb To <b>keep</b> always <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Keep</b> thou always <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Let him <b>keep</b> always <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Keep</b> we or do we <b>keep</b> always <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> <b>Keep</b> ye or do ye or you <b>keep</b> always <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Let them <b>keep</b> always <b>at</b> <b>it.</b> Here is your benevolent Patriarch of a Casby, and there is his golden rule. He is uncommonly {{improving}} to look at, and I am not at all so. He is as sweet as honey, and I am as dull as ditch-water. He provides the pitch, and I handle it, and it sticks to me. Now,' said Mr Pancks, closing upon his late Proprietor again, from whom he had withdrawn a little for the better display of him to the Yard; 'as I am not accustomed to speak in public, and as I have made a rather lengthy speech, all circumstances considered, I shall bring my observations to a close by requesting you {{to get out of}} this.' ...|$|R

I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street. I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled [27] as ever I saw in my life.

On the one hand, I was definitely engaged and had a hundred pounds in my pocket; on the other, the look of the offices, the absence of name on the wall, and other of the points which would strike a business man had left a bad impression as to the position of my employers. However, come what might, I had my money, so I settled down to my task. All Sunday I was kept hard at work, and yet by Monday I had only got as far as H.
