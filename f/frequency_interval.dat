However, later measurements showed that the periodicity of the SKR's modulation varies by as much as 1%, and so probably does not exactly coincide with Saturn’s true rotational period, which as of 2010 remains unknown. Inside the magnetosphere there are radiation belts, which house particles with energy as high as tens of megaelectronvolts. The energetic particles have significant influence on the surfaces of inner icy moons of Saturn.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: Resting-state {{functional}} connectivity {{in subjects}} with cerebral infarction (CI) was assessed using wavelet-based coherence analysis of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals. Methods: Continuous recordings of NIRS signals were measured from the prefrontal cortex and sensorimotor cortical areas of 12 subjects with CI (CI group) and 16 healthy subjects (healthy group) during the resting state. The channels in these areas were divided into four connection types: homologous connectivity, frontoposterior connectivity, contralateral connectivity, and homolateral connectivity. Wavelet coherence (WCO) and wavelet phase coherence (WPCO) were calculated in six <b>frequency</b> <b>intervals</b> in each channel pair: I, 0. 62 Hz; II, 0. 1450. 6 Hz; III, 0. 0520. 145 Hz; IV, 0. 0210. 052 Hz; V, 0. 00950. 021 Hz; and VI, 0. 0050. 0095 Hz. Results: WCO in the six <b>frequency</b> <b>intervals</b> was significant for all channels in the healthy group. By contrast, WCO in <b>frequency</b> <b>intervals</b> IIVI showed weakened connectivity in the CI group, {{especially in terms of}} frontoposterior connectivity. WCO was significantly lower in the CI group than in the healthy group in the following connectivities and frequency intervals: front-posterior, IVVI (p < 0. 05); homologous, IIIV (p < 0. 01); motor-contralateral, IIIV (p < 0. 05); and motorhomolateral, IIIV (p < 0. 05). WPCO in <b>frequency</b> <b>intervals</b> III (F = 5. 032, p = 0. 033) and IV (F = 11. 95, p = 0. 002) in frontoposterior connectivity, as well as in intervals IIIV in homologous, motor-contralateral and motor-homolateral connectivities were significantly lower (p < 0. 05) in the CI group than in the healthy group. However, WPCO in interval I showed significantly higher levels in motor-homolateral connectivity in the CI group than in the healthy group (F = 4. 241, p = 0. 049). Conclusions: The authors results suggest that CI causes a frequency-specific disruption in restingstate connectivity. This may be useful for assessing the effectiveness of functional recovery after CI. Interdisciplinary Division of Biomedical Engineerin...|$|R

A total of thirty subjects were recruited from the university to participate in this study. The cerebral oxygenation signal and TCD hemodynamic parameters were monitored on separate days. The cerebral oxygenation signal was monitored for 10 min from the left prefrontal lobe using NIRS.
