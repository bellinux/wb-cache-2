40|$|An {{approach}} to experimentally exploring electronic correlation functions in mesoscopic regimes is proposed. The {{idea is to}} monitor the mesoscopic fluctuations of a tunneling current flowing between the two layers of a semiconductor double-quantum-well structure. From the dependence of these fluctuations on external parameters, such as in-plane or perpendicular magnetic fields, <b>external</b> <b>bias</b> <b>voltages,</b> etc., the temporal and spatial dependence of various prominent correlation functions of mesoscopic physics can be determined. Due {{to the absence of}} spatially localized external probes, the method provides a way to explore the interplay of interaction and localization effects in two-dimensional systems within a relatively unperturbed environment. We describe the theoretical background of the approach and quantitatively discuss the behavior of the current fluctuations in diffusive and ergodic regimes. The influence of both various interaction mechanisms and localization effects on the current is discussed. Finally a proposal is made on how, at least in principle, the method may be used to experimentally determine the relevant critical exponents of localization-delocalization transitions.

In this study, we show how a low breakdown voltage of a component subcell impacts the EQE determination of a multijunction solar cell and demands {{the use of a}} finely adjusted <b>external</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bias.</b> The optimum <b>voltage</b> <b>bias</b> for the EQE measurement of a Ge subcell in two different GaInP/GaInAs/Ge triple-junction solar cells is determined both by sweeping the <b>external</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bias</b> and by tracing the I–V curve under the same light bias conditions applied during the EQE measurement.
