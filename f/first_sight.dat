5|$|Many {{positions}} are winnable although at <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> {{they appear to}} be non-winnable. For example, the position in the middle diagram is a win for Black in 154 moves (the white pawn is captured at around 80 moves).|$|E
5|$|At <b>first</b> <b>sight,</b> frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that allow a stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs at the <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough fuel {{to cover the}} Ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Middleton, {{a cousin}} of the widowed Mrs. Dashwood, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters move in, and are {{frequent}} guests at Barton Park.

5|$|At <b>first</b> <b>sight,</b> Terahnee {{seems like}} a Utopia. Everyone lives in sumptuous palaces, and nobody goes hungry; in reality, the society is run by slave labor. After writing new Ages, the Terahnee people capture the {{inhabitants}} to use as slaves, considering themselves gods over their Ages. The Terahnee people are taught not to 'see' the slaves; only the servants interact with the lower orders. The Terahnee are suddenly stricken by a plague the D'ni brought with them; Atrus and his companions help the Age's slaves recover and create a new society before returning to D'ni and sealing up the path to Terahnee.|$|E

Hidimbi however falls in love at <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> with Bheema. Unable to wait any longer, Hidimbasura comes to kill the Pandavas himself. Bheema however kills him very easily. Hidimbi is married to Bheema. She later gives birth to Ghatotkacha from this union.|$|E

5|$|Further {{improvements}} {{were made}} under Lord Tyrawley during his term as governor, but progress was hindered by his confrontational {{relationship with his}} senior engineer, William Skinner. Gibraltar's defences were stronger {{than they had been}} in the earlier siege but still had many deficiencies. The fortress seemed at <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> to be well-armed, with 339 cannon in 1744, but this number concealed the fact that they consisted of at least eight different calibres, some made of brass and some of iron – which meant greatly differing levels of reliability – and they required many different types of spares and ammunition, adding to the garrison's logistical problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1823 Helm {{called on}} Representative Benjamin Hardin. While Hardin and Helm {{discussed}} business, Hardin's 14-year-old daughter, Lucinda, {{entered the room}} to show her father a map she had drawn. Helm later claimed {{it was love at}} <b>first</b> <b>sight,</b> and began to pursue Lucinda's affections. They courted for seven years, married in 1830 and had six daughters and five sons together. One of his sons, Benjamin Hardin Helm, was a Confederate general in the Civil War and was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga.|$|E
5|$|Johnson left North Carolina for Tennessee, {{traveling}} {{mostly on}} foot. After {{a brief period}} in Knoxville, he moved to Mooresville, Alabama. He then worked as a tailor in Columbia, Tennessee, but was called back to Raleigh by his mother and stepfather, who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west. Johnson and his party traveled through the Blue Ridge Mountains to Greeneville, Tennessee. Andrew Johnson {{fell in love with}} the town at <b>first</b> <b>sight,</b> and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration.|$|E

Ultimately Soedrajat falls for a beautiful young woman, Koestijah. Meanwhile, Soelarsa saves Koestijah's life while driving a truck through her village; the two fall in love at <b>first</b> <b>sight.</b> By manipulating Koestijah's father, Soedrajat arranges for her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|From her <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> of Florida, Stowe {{was greatly}} impressed. In Palmetto Leaves, she sings {{the praises of}} Florida in January as a {{beautiful}} land capable of producing superior citrus and flowers. In several letters Stowe describes the abundant plant life in the area, dedicating a chapter to yellow jessmines (Gelsemium sempervirens) and another to magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) flowers. She details watching sugarcane pressed into sugar crystals, going visiting with her elderly and obstinate mule named Fly, and discovering the myriad things {{to find in the}} woods and what can be made of them. She also keeps a cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) in a cage and four cats, but sadly reports later in the year that all four cats have died, to the relief and joy of Phœbus the cardinal.|$|E
5|$|ROT47 is a {{derivative}} of ROT13 which, {{in addition to}} scrambling the basic letters, also treats numbers and common symbols. Instead of using the sequence A–Z as the alphabet, ROT47 uses a larger set of characters from the common character encoding known as ASCII. Specifically, the 7-bit printable characters, excluding space, from decimal 33 '!' through 126 '~', 94 in total, taken {{in the order of}} the numerical values of their ASCII codes, are rotated by 47 positions, without special consideration of case. For example, the character A is mapped to p, while a is mapped to 2. The use of a larger alphabet produces a more thorough obfuscation than that of ROT13; for example, a telephone number such as +1-415-839-6885 is not obvious at <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> from the scrambled result Z`\c`d\gbh\eggd. On the other hand, because ROT47 introduces numbers and symbols into the mix without discrimination, it is more immediately obvious that the text has been enciphered.|$|E

5|$|Radha Mohan and Krishna Veni are {{a couple}} leading a miserable marital life due to several misunderstandings and decide to file for divorce. They die on 14 February 1983 at 10:20 AM near a clock tower {{on their way to}} the lawyer's office. Their son, Nageswara Rao, becomes a rich and {{influential}} businessman and happens to come across his parents' lookalikes, Nagarjuna and Priya. After befriending them, Rao decides to re-establish them as a couple but is shocked when Nagarjuna introduces his lover, Prema. Rao manages to dissolve the relationship with the help of his personal adviser, Girish Karnad. Unaware of this, Nagarjuna swears not to fall in love with anyone. At the same clock tower, Rao meets Dr. Anjali and falls in love with her at <b>first</b> <b>sight.</b> He helps her in admitting an injured old man to a nearby hospital and donates his blood. The injured man, Chaitanya, is shocked upon seeing the pair as they resemble his deceased parents, Seetharamudu and Ramalakshmi.|$|E
5|$|Shepstone had the Transvaal's {{annexation}} as a British territory formally {{announced in}} Pretoria on 12 April 1877. Burgers resigned {{and returned to}} the Cape to live in retirement—his last act as President was to announce the government's decision to send a deputation, headed by Kruger and Jorissen, to London to make an official protest. He exhorted the burghers not to attempt any kind of resistance to the British until these diplomats returned. Jorissen, one of the Dutch officials recently imported by Burgers, was included at Kruger's request because of his wide knowledge of European languages (Kruger was not confident in his English); a second Dutchman, Willem Eduard Bok, accompanied them as secretary. They left in May 1877, travelling first to Bloemfontein to confer with the Free State government, then on to Kimberley and Worcester, where the 51-year-old Kruger boarded a train {{for the first time in}} his life. In Cape Town, where his German ancestor had landed 164 years before, he had his <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> of the sea.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{learning}} {{that the young}} emperor of Brazil, Dom PedroII, sought a wife, {{the government of the}} Two Sicilies offered the hand of Teresa Cristina. It also sent PedroII a painting that greatly embellished the princess, which prompted him to accept the proposal. A proxy wedding was held on 30 May 1843 in Naples, PedroII being represented by his fiancée's brother Prince Leopold, Count of Syracuse. A small Brazilian fleet composed of a frigate and two corvettes departed for the Two Sicilies on 3 March 1843 to escort the new Empress of Brazil. She arrived on Rio de Janeiro on 3 September 1843. PedroII immediately rushed to board the ship and greet his bride. Upon seeing this impetuous gesture, the crowds cheered and guns fired deafening salutes. Teresa Cristina {{fell in love with her}} new husband at <b>first</b> <b>sight.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>sighting</b> of the Antarctic Peninsula is disputed but {{apparently}} occurred in 1820.

But the party did not recognize as the mainland {{what they thought was}} an icefield covered by small hillocks.|$|R

5|$|Black can try {{the minor}} line 4...Nc6 that delays the {{development}} of its dark-square bishop, to develop it along the a1–h8 diagonal instead of the a3–f8 diagonal, depending on the circumstances. But the main line is 4...Bc5 to attack the f2-pawn, forcing 5.e3, blocking in White's bishop on c1, so that after 5...Nc6 White will not have enough pieces to protect his e5-pawn in the long run. Placing the bishop on the c5-square also has subtler points, as Tseitlin explains:At <b>first</b> <b>sight</b> the bishop on c5 lacks prospects, being held at bay by the pawn on e3, and is insecure {{in view of the}} threat to exchange it by Nc3–a4/e4. In reality, posting the bishop here has a deep strategic significance. It holds up the advance of the e- and the f-pawns (assuming the white bishop will go to b2), and thereby secures e5 as a future knight outpost, which in turn restricts the activity of both White's bishops. As to the exchanging threat, the bishop may conveniently retreat on a7 or f8, or even in some cases remain on c5 with support from a pawn on b6.|$|E
5|$|Warring Capulets (Michael Toland) and Montagues (Stephen Goldberg), {{portrayed as}} Steller and California sea lions respectively, have their feud watched sadly by Capulet's only daughter, Juliet (Patricia Trippett). A {{fight on the}} shore is ended when the Prince (Phil Nibbelink), a large and monstrous {{elephant}} seal, appears and warns the two groups that, should there be any more disturbance, the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island, a fin shaped rock where a shark lives. Romeo (Daniel Tripett), Montague's only son, is depressed, wishing {{to fall in love}} with someone. His humorous friend, Mercutio (Chip Albers), urges him and another of his friends, Benvolio (Sam Gold), to go to a Capulet party later that evening. They attend the party, covered in white sand to look like Capulets, and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at <b>first</b> <b>sight.</b> Juliet, however, was promised by her father to marry the Prince, who attends the party. Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc, and are revealed to be Montagues. Later that evening, the play's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows. Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning, and she will not have to marry the Prince.|$|E
