5|$|According to Skeat {{the note}} in the codex {{indicated}} that the manuscript had not previously been in the Patriarchal Library <b>in</b> <b>Alexandria.</b> The manuscript was carried from Constantinople to Alexandria between 1308 and 1316, together with two mentioned above manuscripts of Chrysostom. It remained <b>in</b> <b>Alexandria</b> until 1621, when Cyril removed it once to Constantinople. Whether was originally written, in Constantinople or <b>in</b> <b>Alexandria,</b> is another question.
