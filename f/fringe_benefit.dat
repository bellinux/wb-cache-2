25|$|As president, McDonald {{emphasized}} enhancing <b>fringe</b> <b>benefit.</b> The {{election of}} Dwight D. Eisenhower {{as president and}} the advent of Republican majorities in the United States Congress (at least from 1952 to 1954) made expansion of social programs unlikely even if some later occurred. To compensate, McDonald focused negotiations on benefits such as unemployment compensation, health insurance, pensions, tuition reimbursement, and more. Throughout the 1950s, however, McDonald often felt an intense rivalry with the Auto Workers (UAW). The UAW often won better wage and benefit packages than the Steelworkers, and were able to obtain the closed shop. McDonald's negotiating stands often reflected the interunion jealousy.|$|E

Our results indicate that when controlling for various individual and job characteristics, there remains a wage gap in favour of whites, and for several <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits,</b> there is an unexplained gap in favour of blacks.

40|$|<b>Fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> {{of various}} kinds have become an {{essential}} element of modern labour market mechanisms. Firms offer transport-related <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> such as transport subsidies (company cars, travel and parking subsidies) and relocation subsidies to job applicants. The spatial implications of these <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> have hardly received any systematic attention thus far. The present paper addresses this largely unexplored issue. Using information from a survey on firms' recruitment behaviour in the UK, this paper demonstrates that the applicants' journey-to-work time induces firms to offer various transport-related <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> to job applicants. The implications of these transport-related <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> for commuting and relocation are rather distinct. Transport subsidies discourage applicants, whereas relocation subsidies induce applicants to move closer to the workplace. We interpret the results as evidence that employers offer transport-related <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> either to reduce the length of the journey to work or to compensate employees for the incurred commuting costs. fringe benefits; company car; residential mobility...|$|R

Analysis of the survey reveals that women who own SMEs are more likely than men who own similar firms to provide employees with <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> such as annual leave, social benefits, and health insurance.

40|$|Mobility {{management}} measures taken by firms could potentially {{result in more}} sustainable transport choices and hence reduce traffic congestion and emissions. <b>Fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> offered to employees are a means to implement those measures. This paper explores the most common commuting-related <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> currently provided by employers in the Netherlands, namely telework, flextime and allowance types like public transport passes, bicycle contribution, company cars and general financial compensation. By using the Dutch National Time Use Survey (TBO) 2005 / 2006, interrelationships among <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> and correlations between company, employee, and (home and work) location characteristics and those employee benefits could be investigated. Logistic regressions and Tobit models are used for several estimations indicating the provision {{and the use of}} <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits.</b> The results show that relationships among <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> exist, mainly between telework and flextime, but also between those flexible work arrangements and some types of commuting allowance. Furthermore, numerous job, person and geographical variables affect the probability of receiving and using the <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits.</b> For example, in the non-profit and the public sector sustainable commuting benefits are more often provided, the use of <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> is strongly influenced by household composition and several allowance types show a significant correlation with the number of cars in the household.

40|$|May 1998 (Revised May 2000) This {{paper offers}} {{a new way of}} {{estimating}} workers' valuation of <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> using data on workers' choices among <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> packages offered by the employer. This approach overcomes both the omitted variable problem and the identification problem that bias estimates of compensating differentials and supply and demand parameters for <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> from the traditional hedonic model most frequently used to analyze this problem. With this approach, the observed choice among offered <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> packages which require different employee contributions and receive different employer subsidies conveys information about how much in wages workers are willing to give up to obtain additional firm dollars in the form of <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits.</b> That is the valuation of <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> that we want to estimate. The comparison among alternatives implicit in the discrete choice method differences away fixed unobservable individual productivity differences that are believed to be the main problem in estimating compensating differentials and lessens the endogeneity problems that arise in estimating hedonic demand parameters. Variation in the offered wage-fringe price across firms identifies workers' valuation of fringe dollars, serving the same function as the sometimes arbitrary market boundaries that must be imposed in the hedonic model to achieve identification. Exploratory empirical results using grouped firm data on choices of alternative health insurance plans provide support for the proposed approach. Unlike most estimates of compensating differentials for <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits,</b> the estimates are of the correct sign. The results suggest that families value health benefits substantially more than singles and that that valuation of <b>fringe</b> <b>benefits</b> dollars is substantially less than one-for-one with wage dollars. ...|$|R
