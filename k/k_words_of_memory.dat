40|$|Abstract — Efficient {{programmable}} baseband processors {{are important}} in order to enable true multi-standard radio platforms and software defined radio systems. In programmable processors, the memory sub-system accounts for {{a large part of}} both the area and power consumption. This paper presents a methodology for designing memory efficient multi-standard baseband processors. The methodology yields baseband processor micro-architectures, which eliminate excessive data moves between memories while still allowing true flexibility by utilizing SIMD clusters connected to memory banks via an internal network. The methodology has successfully been used to create a multi-standard baseband processor for OFDM-based wireless standards. This paper discusses the IEEE 802. 16 e (WiMAX), DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcast- Handheld) and DAB (Digital Audio Broadcast) standards. The architecture is truly scalable to accommodate future OFDM systems. Scheduling and resource allocation show that with the proposed memory structure and architecture, the processor can manage the baseband functions of the described standards operating at 80 MHz and using only 28 <b>k</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory.</b> I...|$|E

An (α, β) -spanner of a graph G is a subgraph S ⊆ G {{such that}} for {{each pair of}} vertices the distance in S is at most α times the distance in G plus β. We assume that the graph is given as a stream of edges and vertices, and that only one pass over the data is allowed. Furthermore, the number of vertices and edges are not known in advance. We denote by m the current number of scanned edges and by n the current number of discovered vertices. In this model we show how to compute a (k, k - 1) -spanner of an unweighted undirected graph, for k = 2, 3, in O (1) amortized processing time per edge/vertex.

Geological Survey Three broad geologic environmentB, or reservoirs, having appreciable amounts of U, Th, and Pb and sufficient longevity, are required by the plumbotectonics model. These resevoirs, the mantle, upper continental crust, and lower continental crust, and an additional short-lived mixing orogene provide the necessary chemical environments to produce gross terrestrial isotopic patterns. The transfer of matter among reservoirs is treated as proceeding through cycles called orogenies of discrete, sequential operations that can be expressed {{by a series of}} BASIC program statements (paralleling the algebraic equations of the companion paper). From the sets of numerical data generated as matrix arrays, both the total mass distribution and the U, Th, and Pb isotopic contents among reservoirs can be determined as a function of time. Two versions of the model are presented by Zartman and Doe (in press), which follow the same basic program form and differ only in certain parametric values. We list version I in its entirety in Appendix A, and supply the pertinent substitute lines for conversion to version II in Appendix B. In addition to yielding mass distribution and U, Th, and Pb isotopic contents of reservoirs, several output options are available for calculating isotopic ratios, mean age of the crust, and isotope concentrations of reservoirs. A separate subroutine is also provided, which modifies the main program, for computing the mean age of isotopes in the crust.

40|$|SPEC is {{the name}} of the {{operating}} system designed to control the NMR spectrometers in lab. SPEC is actually one large program which handles many functions necessary to control each spectrometer. The program handles all I/O with peripheral devices such as the console ('terminal' or 'CRT'). The program carries out its operations by accepting commands which each invoke specific subroutines to perform their function. There are a total of 60 commands in SPEC, each carrying out a different function. Because so many commands make SPEC a very large program, not all of the program is core resident. Rather, each command calls in an overlay handler which loads into memory the appropriate overlay from the disk and begins execution of the command. Thus SPEC is an independent disk based operating system. The commands in SPEC are capable of operating the microprocessor based pulse programmer, starting and acquiring data from the spectrometer data acquisition system, storing data on disk and manipulating it mathematically, displaying and plotting data. All arithmetic operations within SPEC are performed on integers. Since the DATA GENERAL computers are 16 bit machines operating in two's complement mode, the integer range is + 32767. Many of the mathematical operations of SPEC are done in double precision integer mode with the final result always scaled to the above range. For many of the commands, integer overflow is detected and reported as an error message. Overflowed points are set to + 32767. SPEC accepts command input from the console or reads a string of commands previously entered on the disk. The later command structure is called a macro. Macros may be nested and may have constants passed to them at execution time, thus allowing for a powerful supercommand structure. Both forms of commands are discussed in the next section. SPEC is designed to run on a DATA GENERAL computer with 32 <b>K</b> <b>words</b> <b>of</b> <b>memory</b> and a 10 Mbyte hard disk system. There are minor differences between the various computers in lab which are discussed in one of the appendices. The disk systems consist of two. 5 Mbyte platters, one fixed and one in a removable pack. While running SPEC, all disk I/O is with the fixed disk. All pulse programs, data records, phase box records, etc. reside on the fixed disk. Thus each disk drive is specific to one spectrometer. When running under RDOS (the DG operating system) these disk files may also be accessed. All the source listings of SPEC subroutines, the SPEC program library, and all supporting programs reside on one of the removable packs (labeled 'SPEC'). This pack will normally be in the drive but it is not required to run SPEC. It is required to run any of the supporting programs discussed in another chapter. This manual attempts to document the SPEC operating system and related topics. The following section discusses the general operation of SPEC including how to get into the program and how to issue commands. The following chapters discuss the commands in detail, operation of the microprocessor based pulse programmer, spectrometer peripherals, supporting programs, and how to create and load a 'TEMP' program.

40|$|Abstract — As the VLSI {{technologies}} {{scale down}} to the nanometer regime, the circuit design and verification processes have {{become more and more}} complex and a reliable operation of VLSI becomes sensitive to the PVT (Process, Voltage, and Temperature) variations. Therefore, the LSI test only before the shipment to screen out the initial failures has been insufficient to ensure the reliable in-field operation of LSI. In this paper, we propose an SoC platform with on-chip web interface to realize an in-field LSI testing and an easy access to the on-chip LSI monitoring circuits such as scan registers, temperature sensors, and so on. We can control the on-chip monitoring systems through the web interface, and can monitor the LSI correct operations from remote locations using the proposed platform. Therefore, the proposed SoC platform realizes the LSI functionality monitoring even after the shipment and can test the in-field operation of LSI.

40|$|IMAPS (Interactive Minicomputer Array Processing System) is {{a system}} of {{minicomputer}} software for processing large, two-dimensional arrays of gridded data such as those employed in the earth sciences, particularly remote sensing of the environment. IMAPS was designed to have wide applicability based on {{the flexibility of the}} software and its modest hardware requirements. Written in Fortran and operating in an interactive, single-user mode, the system provides a variety of array processing functions. These functions presently include routines for reading and calibrating LANDSAT and NOAA satellite data tapes, statistically summarizing array regions and transects, generating contrast-enhanced images via line printer or electrostatic plotter, and converting data from contoured to gridded format. Users having specialized needs can add their own functions to the system; this can be done without increasing core requirements inasmuch as each function is organized as a separate overlay. The design of new functions is facilitated by the availability of a library of utility subroutines, which perform tasks commonly required in array processing, such as buffering array data to and from disc. The data buffering subroutines are quite flexible, allowing variable array size, processing of from 2 to 10 arrays in parallel, and sequential or random access to individual array elements.
