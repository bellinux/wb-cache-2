40|$|The {{trajectories of}} {{pheromone}} plumes in canopied habitats, such as orchards, have been little studied. We documented {{the capture of}} male navel orangeworm moths, Amyelois transitella, in female-baited traps positioned at 5 levels, from ground level to the canopy top, at approximately 6 m above ground, in almond orchards. Males were captured in similar proportions at all levels, suggesting {{that they do not}} favor a particular height during ranging flight. A 3 -D sonic anemometer was used to establish patterns of wind flow and temperature at 6 heights from 2. 08 to 6. 65 m in an almond orchard with a 5 m high canopy, every 3 h over 72 h. The horizontal velocity of wind flow was highest above the canopy, where its directionality also was the most consistent. During the time of A. transitella mating (0300 – 0600), there was a net vertical displacement upward. Vertical buoyancy combined with only minor reductions in the distance that plumes will travel in the lower compared to the upper canopy suggest that the optimal height for release of pheromone from high-release-rate sources, such as <b>aerosol</b> <b>dispensers</b> (“puffers”), that are deployed at low densities (e. g., 3 per ha.) would be at mid or low in the canopy, thereby facilitating dispersion of disruptant throughout the canopy. Optimal placement of <b>aerosol</b> <b>dispensers</b> will vary with the behavioral ecology of the target pest; however, our results suggest that current protocols, which generally propose dispenser placement in the upper third of the canopy, should be reevaluated...|$|R

40|$|Liquids {{forced from}} a {{high-pressure}} zone into a low-pressure zone often cross the equilibrium pressure for the liquid temperature and disintegrate into a spray by partial evolution of vapor.

A critical superheat was found, above which the jet of liquid is shattered by rapid bubble growth within it. The bubble-growth rate was correlated with the Weber number, and a critical value of the Weber number was found to be 12. 5 for low-viscosity liquids. The mean drop size was also correlated with Weber number and degree of superheat.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, the {{official}} regulation of chemicals and chemical products has been intensified. Explicitly for spray products enhanced requirements {{to assess the}} consumers’/professionals’ exposure to such product type have been introduced. In this regard the Aerosol-Dispensers-Directive (75 / 324 /EEC) with obligation for marketing <b>aerosol</b> <b>dispensers,</b> and the Cosmetic-Products-Regulation (1223 / 2009 /EC) which obliges the insurance of a safety assessment, have to be mentioned. Both enactments, similar to the REACH regulation (1907 / 2006 /EC), require a robust chemical safety assessment. From such assessment, appropriate risk management measures may be identified to adequately control the risk of these chemicals/products to {{human health and the}} environment when used. Currently, the above-mentioned regulations lack the guidance on which data are needed for preparing a proper hazard analysis and safety assessment of spray products. Mandatory in the process of inhalation risk and safety assessment is the determination and quantification of the actual exposure to the spray product and more specifically, its ingredients. In this respect the current article, prepared by the European Aerosol Federation (FEA, Brussels) task force “Inhalation Toxicology”, intends to introduce toxicological principles and the state of the art in currently available exposure models adapted for typical application scenarios. This review on current methodologies is intended to guide safety assessors to better estimate inhalation exposure by using the most relevant data...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{saving and}} energy saving are {{essential}} components of “energy security” problem {{in all the}} countries, which raises the importance of analysis and revision of approaches to organization of recording and audit of resource saving innovations at industrial companies. The article’s objective is to study organization of recording and audit of resource saving technologies at industrial companies. A review of resource saving purposes and methods is given. For accounting purposes, innovations in resource saving are recorded now as intangible assets. Recording of resource saving innovations and technologies at industrial companies is confined to recording of transactions on creation or acquisition of patent rights objects and intellectual property objects. The author’s approach to organization of audit by the conformity of resource saving innovations with M. Porter’s test is proposed. Data showing success story of a Ukrainian company manufacturing polyurethane foam sealant PENADO in the <b>aerosol</b> <b>dispenser</b> is used to confirm that Ukraine does have potentials to introduce and utilize resource saving technologies, including energy saving ones. The proposed model for recording and audit of resource saving innovations {{should be used in}} strategic planning of resource saving innovations at the companies incorporated in industrial groups or holdings. Using this model, a company can reveal and assess the mismatch between amounts of resources that can be allocated in innovation and real capacities for introducing innovative resource saving technologies, and factors having the strongest impact on recourse saving innovations at companies incorporated in one financial and industrial group or holding. The proposed model accounts for the specific operative conditions in holdings and tough conditions for business operation of industrial companies in Ukraine. ...|$|R
30|$|The classifications {{presented}} here {{tend to be}} under-classifications to outline the best case, not the worst case. As I {{did not have the}} comprehensive data base like the producers of the respective products, I deliberately made the following assumptions which may lead to less severe classifications: (1) Where self classifications of various companies differed in several H-statements, I used the classification which the majority of companies agreed upon, which was usually not the most severe classification. (2) In most basic recipes no specific chemical names were given for preservatives, colorants, pigments or fragrances. In these cases I did not consider them at all, although it is known that most of them are hazardous substances. (3) I did not consider any potential contaminations, impurities or stabilizers/preservatives as part of an ingredient as I assume that they are present below the cut off values ([1] Annex I 1.1. 4.1). (4) I pretended that all properties of all ingredients are known and did not make use of the possibility to subtract substances with unknown properties ([1] Annex I 3.1. 3.6. 2). However, when no information could be retrieved for more than 20 % of the total product, products were not considered further. Most decorative cosmetic products which contained up to 10 % of unnamed pigments reached this limit and could not be analyzed further. Also natural ingredients pose problems for the correct classification, as the available information is scanter than for synthetic ingredients. Some ingredients do not have a CAS or EC number and could not be investigated further. Products which contained more than 80 % water were not considered if half of the remaining ingredients were unclear. (5) I pretended that the pH values are in a medium range and not extremely low or high. Therefore, I did not consider pH-effects of mixtures. (6) I pretended that diluted ingredients are diluted with water and not with any other solvent. (7) I had no information about the physical properties like thermal stability, heat of combustion, flash point or boiling point of the mixtures. I assumed that these properties were not crucial for cosmetic products and considered only the physical hazards of <b>aerosol</b> <b>dispensers.</b> (8) When the components were heated to allow chemical reactions before preparation of the final product (e.g. for soap production) I considered neither the raw material nor the reaction products.|$|R

40|$|Inhalants are {{a diverse}} group of {{volatile}} substances whose chemical vapors can be inhaled to produce psychoactive (mind-altering) effects. While other abused substances can be inhaled, the term “inhalants ” is used to describe substances that are rarely, if ever, taken by any other route of administration. A variety of products common in the home and workplace contain substances that can be inhaled to get high; however, people do not typically think of these products (e. g., spray paints, glues, and cleaning fluids) as drugs because they were never intended to induce intoxicating effects. Yet young children and adolescents can easily obtain these extremely toxic substances, and are among those most likely to abuse them. In fact, more 8 th graders have tried inhalants than any other illicit drug. 1 What Types of Products are Abused as Inhalants? Inhalants generally fall into the following categories: Volatile solvents—liquids that vaporize at room temperature Industrial or household products, including paint thinners or removers, degreasers, dry-cleaning fluids, gasoline, lighter fluid Art or office supply solvents, including correction fluids, felt-tip marker fluid, electronic contact cleaners, glue Aerosols—sprays that contain propellants and solvents Household aerosol propellants in items such as spray paints, hair or deodorant sprays, fabric protector sprays, aerosol computer cleaning products, and vegetable oil sprays Gases—found in household or commercial products and used as medical anesthetics Household or commercial products, including butane lighters and propane tanks, whipped cream <b>aerosols</b> or <b>dispensers</b> (whippets), and refrigerant gases Medical anesthetics, such as ether, chloroform, halothane, and nitrous oxide (“laughing gas”) Nitrites—a special class of inhalants that are used primarily as sexual enhancers Organic nitrites are volatiles that include cyclohexyl, butyl, and amyl nitrites, commonly known as “poppers. ” Amyl nitrite is still used in certain diagnostic medical procedures.

The subsequent one week exposure of shells in aerosol, prepared from the distilled water without Ni reduced the concentration of nickel in the tissue of the digestive gland. Thus, bioavailability of HM and nickel solutions prepared from untreated wastewaters in breathing aerosol and possibly by skin contact was demonstrated.

40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{is crucial}} to {{quantify}} the amount of absorbing aerosol present in the atmosphere because it may lower the single scatter albedo of otherwise mainly scattering aerosol. These absorbing aerosols consist primarily of dust, smoke from biomass burning, and carbonaceous aerosol associated with fossil fuel burning. These aerosols also may act as cloud condensation nuclei, thereby increasing reflection of solar radiation by clouds. In order to estimate the indirect effect, the quantification of the fraction of absorbing, carbonaceous aerosol relative to natural organic aerosol is needed. In this proposal we plan to use our global aerosol model in combination with meteorological fields that have been nudged towards observed or analyzed fields to enable us to compare predicted absorbing aerosols with observed aerosols as derived from the TOMS instrument (Herman et al., 1997). The TOMS instrument is only able to record absorbing aerosol above about 2 km.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{that a single}} zone furnace with a modified synthesis chamber design is sufficient to obtain metal (Fe, Co or Ni) filled carbon nanotubes (CNT) with high filling efficiency and controlled morphology. Samples are formed by pyrolysis of metallocenes, a synthesis technique that otherwise requires a dual zone furnace. Respective metallocene in all three cases are sublimed in powder form, a crucial factor for obtaining high filling efficiency. While Fe@CNT is routinely produced using this technique, well-formed Ni@CNT or Co@CNT samples are reported for the first time. This is achieved by sublimation of nickelocene (or cobaltocene) in combination with 'camphor'. These samples exhibit {{some of the highest}} saturation magnetization (Ms) values, at least an order of magnitude higher than that reported for Ni or Co <b>filled</b> CNT, by <b>aerosol</b> assisted pyrolysis. The results also elucidate on why Ni or Co@CNT are relatively difficult to obtain by pyrolyzing powder metallocene alone. Overall, a systematic variation of synthesis parameters provides insights for obtaining narrow length and diameter distribution and reduced residue particles outside filled CNT - factors which are important for device related applications. Finally, the utility of this technique is demonstrated by obtaining highly aligned forest of Fe 2 O 3 @CNT, wherein Fe 2 O 3 is a functional magnetic oxide relevant to spintronics and battery applications...|$|R
40|$|Definition: Although other abused {{drugs can}} be inhaled, the term inhalants is {{reserved}} for {{the wide variety of}} substances—including solvents, aerosols, gases, and nitrites—that are rarely, if ever, taken via any other route of administration. (See below for a list of examples.) Many products readily found in the home or workplace—such as spray paints, markers, glues, and cleaning fluids—contain volatile substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when inhaled. People do not typically think of these products as drugs because they were never intended for that purpose. However, these products are sometimes abused in that way. They are especially (but not exclusively) abused by young children and adolescents, and are the only class of substance abused more by younger than by older teens. How Are Inhalants Abused? Abusers of inhalants breathe them in through the nose or mouth {{in a variety of ways}} (known as “huffing”). They may sniff or snort fumes from a container or dispenser (such as a glue bottle or a marking pen), spray aerosols (such as computer cleaning dusters) directly into their nose or mouth, or place a chemical-soaked rag in their mouth. Abusers may also inhale fumes from a balloon or a plastic or paper bag. Although the high produced by inhalants usually lasts just a few minutes, abusers often try to prolong it by continuing to inhale repeatedly over several hours. People tend to abuse different inhalant products at different ages. New users ages 12 – 15 most commonly abuse glue, shoe polish, spray paints, gasoline, and lighter fluid. New users ages 16 – 17 most commonly abuse nitrous oxide or “whippets. ” Adults most commonly abuse a class of inhalants known as nitrites (such as amyl nitrites or “poppers”). How Do Inhalants Affect the Brain? Most abused inhalants other than nitrites depress the central nervous system in a manner not unlike alcohol. The effects are similar—including slurred speech, lack of coordination, euphoria, and dizziness. Inhalant abusers may also experience light-headedness, hallucinations, and delu-sions. With repeated inhalations, many users feel less inhibited and less in control. Some may feel drowsy for several hours and experience a lingering headache. Unlike other types of inhalants, nitrites enhance sexual pleasure by dilating and relaxing blood vessels. Although it is not very common, addiction to inhalants can occur with repeated abuse What Are the Other Health Effects of Inhalants Chemicals found in different types of inhaled products may produce a vari-ety of other short-term effects, such as nausea or vomiting, as well as more serious long-term consequences. These may include liver and kidney damage, hearing loss, or bone marrow damage. Effects may also include loss of coordination and limb spasms due to damage to myelin—a protective sheathing around nerve fibers that helps nerves transmit messages in the brain and peripheral nervous system. Inhalants can also cause brain damage by cutting off oxygen flow to the brain. Inhalants can even be lethal. Sniffing highly concentrated amounts of the chemicals in solvents or aerosol sprays can directly cause heart failure within minutes. This syndrome, known as “sudden sniffing death,” can result from a single session of inhalant use by an otherwise healthy young person. High concentrations of inhal-ants may also cause death from suffocation, especially when inhaled from a paper or plastic bag or in a closed area. Even when using aerosols or volatile products for their legitimate purposes like painting or cleaning, it is wise to do so in a well-ventilated room or outdoors. Nitrites are a special class of inhalants that are abused to enhance sexual pleasure and performance. They can be associated with unsafe sexual practices that increase the risk of contracting and spreading infectious diseases like HIV/AIDS and hepatitis.

40|$|International audienceIn June and July 2016 the Dynamics–Aerosol–Chemistry–Cloud Interactions in West Africa (DACCIWA) project {{organised}} a {{major international}} field campaign in southern West Africa (SWA) including measurements from three inland ground supersites, urban sites in Cotonou and Abidjan, radiosondes and three research aircraft. A significant range of different weather situations was encountered during this period, including the monsoon onset. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to characterise the large-scale setting for the campaign as well as synoptic and mesoscale weather systems affecting the study region in the light of existing conceptual ideas, mainly using objective and subjective identification algorithms based on (re-) analysis and satellite products. In addition, it is shown how the described synoptic variations influence the atmospheric composition over SWA through advection of mineral-dust, biomass-burning and urban-pollution plumes. The boreal summer of 2016 was characterised by Pacific La Niña, Atlantic El Niño and warm eastern Mediterranean conditions, whose competing influences on precipitation led to an overall average rainy season. During the relatively dusty pre-onset Phase 1 (1 – 21 June 2016), three westward propagating coherent cyclonic vortices between 4 and 13 °[*]N modulated winds and rainfall in the Guinea coastal area. The monsoon onset occurred in connection with a marked extratropical trough and cold surge over northern Africa, leading to a breakdown of the Saharan heat low and African easterly jet and a suppression of rainfall. During this period, quasi-stationary low-level vortices associated with the trough transformed into more tropical, propagating disturbances resembling an African easterly wave (AEW). To the east of this system, moist southerlies penetrated deep into the continent. The post-onset Phase 2 (22 June– 20 July 2016) was characterised by a significant increase of low-level cloudiness, unusually dry conditions and strong northeastward dispersion of urban pollution plumes in SWA as well as rainfall modulation by westward propagating AEWs in the Sahel. Around 12 – 14 July 2016 an interesting and so-far undocumented cyclonic-anticyclonic vortex couplet crossed SWA. The anticyclonic centre had its origin in the southern hemisphere and transported unusually dry air <b>filled</b> with aged <b>aerosol</b> into the region. During Phase 3 (21 – 26 July 2016), a similar vortex couplet slightly farther north created enhanced westerly moisture transports into SWA and extraordinarily wet conditions, accompanied by a deep penetration of the biomass-burning plume from central Africa. Finally, a return to more undisturbed monsoon conditions took place during Phase 4 (27 – 31 July 2016). The in-depth synoptic analysis reveals that several significant weather systems during the DACCIWA campaign cannot be attributed unequivocally to any of the tropical waves and disturbances described in the literature, and thus deserve further study...|$|R
