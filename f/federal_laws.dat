50|$|States {{sometimes}} have taken various actions short of nullification {{in an effort}} to prevent enforcement of <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> While nullification is an attempt to declare <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> unconstitutional and to forbid its enforcement within the state, some other actions by the states do not attempt to declare <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> invalid, but instead use other means {{in an effort to}} prevent or hinder enforcement of <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R

5000|$|As noted above, the Supreme Court {{indicated}} in Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 41 U.S. 539 (1842), {{that the states}} cannot be compelled to use state law enforcement resources to enforce <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> The Supreme Court reaffirmed this principle in cases such as Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997) and New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992), which held {{that the federal government}} may not enact a regulatory program that [...] "commandeers" [...] the state's legislative and administrative mechanisms to enforce <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> States therefore may refuse to use their legislative or administrative resources to enforce <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> This should be distinguished from nullification. States that withhold their enforcement assistance, but do not declare the <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> unconstitutional or forbid its enforcement by the federal government, are not declaring <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> invalid and therefore are not engaging in nullification. As Prigg held, the <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> still is valid and federal authorities may enforce it within the state. The states in this situation, rather than attempting to legally nullify <b>federal</b> <b>law,</b> are attempting to make enforcement of <b>federal</b> <b>law</b> more difficult by refusing to make available their legislative and administrative resources.|$|R
5|$|On November 4, 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders {{introduced}} the bill into Senate. It was read twice {{and referred to}} the Committee on the Judiciary.

5|$|Although it is {{situated}} in New York City, the land occupied by the United Nations Headquarters and the spaces of buildings that it rents are under the sole administration of the United Nations and not the U.S. government. They are technically extraterritorial through a treaty agreement with the U.S. government. However, in exchange for local police, fire protection and other services, the United Nations agrees to acknowledge most local, state, and <b>federal</b> <b>laws.</b>|$|E
50|$|Some {{states have}} legalized acts that are {{prohibited}} by <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> For example, several states have legalized recreational marijuana use {{under state law}}. Whether an act is legal under state law {{does not affect the}} legality of that act under <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> An act may be legal under state law, {{and at the same time}} illegal under <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> The states that have legalized marijuana use have not attempted to declare that <b>federal</b> marijuana <b>laws</b> are invalid or unenforceable. Rather, <b>federal</b> marijuana <b>laws</b> still are valid and enforceable, even in states that have made marijuana legal under state law. Thus, these states have not attempted to nullify <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b>|$|R
50|$|In Australia, under <b>federal</b> <b>law,</b> {{sexual conduct}} between consenting adults (18 {{years of age}} or older) is legal, and state incest laws are subject to the {{overriding}} <b>federal</b> <b>law.</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>law</b> prohibits marriage to an opposite-sex ancestor and descendant or sibling (including a sibling of half-blood), including those traced through adoption.|$|R

Some domestic nations such as the Yakama Nation and the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council rejected the approval to allow marijuana on their reservation.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, federal {{prosecutors}} such as Eugene Reese attempted to prosecute responsible parties under <b>federal</b> <b>laws</b> against debt peonage. But such efforts received little support nationally and {{none in the}} South, which had disenfranchised most blacks to exclude them from the political system. Northern attention was focused on immigration and World War I. The convict lease system finally ended {{with the advent of}} World War II. National and presidential attention was focused on racial issues because of the need for national unity and mobilization of the military.|$|E
5|$|Iowa was {{decommissioned}} for {{the last}} time in October 1990 after 19 total years of active service, and was initially stricken from the Naval Vessel Register in 1995.

5|$|The most {{important}} ACLU {{case of the}} 1920s was Gitlow v. New York, in which Benjamin Gitlow was arrested for violating a state law against inciting anarchy and violence, when he distributed literature promoting communism.

5|$|To {{bolster the}} new amendment, Grant {{relied on the}} army and signed {{legislation}} creating the Justice Department, primarily to enforce <b>federal</b> <b>laws</b> in the South. Where the attorney general had once been only a legal adviser to the president, he now led a cabinet department dedicated to enforcing federal law, including a solicitor general to argue on the government's behalf in court. Under Grant's first attorney general, Ebenezer R. Hoar, the administration was not very aggressive in prosecuting white Southerners who terrorized their black neighbors, but Hoar's successor, Amos T. Akerman, was more zealous.|$|E
5|$|When {{used in a}} {{court of}} law digital {{evidence}} falls under the same legal guidelines as other forms of evidence; courts do not usually require more stringent guidelines.

5|$|A {{controversy}} {{arose in}} March 2015, {{when it was}} revealed by the State Department's inspector general that Clinton had exclusively used personal email accounts on a non-government, privately maintained server—instead of email accounts maintained on federal government servers—when conducting official business during her tenure as secretary of state. Some experts, officials, members of Congress and political opponents contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures and <b>federal</b> <b>laws</b> and regulations governing recordkeeping requirements. The controversy occurred {{against the backdrop of}} Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the House Select Committee on Benghazi.|$|E
5|$|On August 4 limited {{transportation}} service resumed but largely dwindled {{as the day}} progressed. Hayes and his staff warned the strikers about the severe penalties provided by the SmithConnally Act for disruption of the war production: the instigators could {{be subject to a}} fine of $5,000, one year in prison, or both. This prospect was made more real when the United States Attorney General Francis Biddle started an inquiry into possible violations of <b>federal</b> <b>laws</b> by the strike organizers. On August 4 the strike committee again voted to continue the strike, but, in view of the possible SmithConnally Act penalties, told the workers to make up their own minds and follow the committee if they chose. The maneuver worked and the strike continued.|$|E
5|$|President Theodore Roosevelt {{appointed}} Landis {{a federal}} judge in 1905. Landis received national attention in 1907 when he fined Standard Oil of Indiana more than $29million for violating <b>federal</b> <b>laws</b> forbidding rebates on railroad freight tariffs. Though Landis was reversed on appeal, he was seen as a judge determined to rein in big business. During and after World War I, Landis presided over several high-profile trials of draft resisters and others whom he saw as opposing the war effort. He imposed heavy sentences on those who were convicted; some of the convictions were reversed on appeal, and other sentences were commuted.|$|E

A public hunting program removed many of the feral animals, at least temporarily. An active control program is in place, though it is not conducted with sufficient rigor to allow significant recovery of the māmane-naio ecosystem. There are many other species and ecosystems on the island, and on Mauna Kea, that remain threatened by human development and invasive species.|$|E
