25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have {{to be careful not to}} get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E
2500|$|Both as a rower {{and as a}} rowing coach, Courtney {{was known}} for his {{distinctive}} stroke. This style of rowing would become known as the Courtney Stroke. The most evident trait of the stroke is the positioning of the back. The back is always kept in a very straight position. Courtney is quoted as saying, [...] "No kink in the back if I <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] He kept the back straight to allow the lungs to work without difficulty with no strain on the abdominal muscles. His idea was influenced by watching famous professional rower Harry Coulter in 1870 at Buffalo, New York.|$|E

6000|$|He laughed shrewdly. “Not {{as long as}} our old hunters <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it. I’m {{dividing}} {{amongst them}} a dollar a skin for all the skins shot by our new hunters. At least half of their enthusiasm to-day was due to that. Oh, no, there won’t be any escaping if they <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it. And now you’d better get for’ard to your hospital duties.

60|$|But {{when the}} other colonists {{determined}} to resist unjust taxation, and resolved {{that they would not}} use tea, on which a heavy tax was laid without allowing the American people to <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, the patriotic people of New Jersey resolved that they too would use no tea so long as this unjust tax was placed upon it. When the tea was destroyed in Boston Harbor, the Jersey patriots applauded the act, and would have been glad to show in the same way what they thought upon the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] and {{the sick}} man shrieked with an energy {{that made him}} audible all through the house. [...] "I can do nothing that I would choose to do; be nothing that I would wish to be! What can I do? What can I be? What {{gratification}} can I have except the brandy bottle? If I go among gentlemen, can I talk to them? If they <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> a railway, they will ask me a question: if they speak to me beyond that, I must be dumb. If I go among my workmen, can they talk to me? No; I am their master, and a stern master. They bob their heads and shake in their shoes when they see me. Where are my friends? Here!" [...] said he, and he dragged a bottle from under his very pillow. [...] "Where are my amusements? Here!" [...] and he brandished the bottle almost in the doctor's face. [...] "Where is my one resource, my one gratification, my only comfort after all my toils. Here, doctor; here, here, here!" [...] and, so saying, he replaced his treasure beneath his pillow.|$|E

5000|$|He {{also argues}} that this 'interconnectedness' {{is the basis of}} ethics: when we see the inter-dependency of all relationships, it is {{possible}} to implement The Golden Rule. Steven Tainer describes his view on leadership, which is unique yet highly relevant: I am somewhat appalled by the notion that I <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> being a leader, because I have spent so much of my life trying to avoid the leadership stereotype. It's a model that doesn't fit into what I am trying to do together with other people. There are many common teacher-student relationships that involve a [...] "leader and led" [...] logic. I try to avoid that.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{commonly}} studied formal logics are propositional logic, predicate logic and their modal analogs, and for these there are standard ways of presenting an interpretation. In these contexts an interpretation {{is a function}} that provides the extension of symbols and strings of symbols of an object language. For example, an interpretation function could take the predicate T (for [...] "tall") and assign it the extension {a} (for [...] "Abraham Lincoln"). Note that all our interpretation does is assign the extension {a} to the non-logical constant T, and {{does not make a}} claim about whether T is to stand for tall and 'a' for Abraham Lincoln. Nor does logical interpretation <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> logical connectives like 'and', 'or' and 'not'. Though we may take these symbols to stand for certain things or concepts, this is not determined by the interpretation function.|$|E
5000|$|Red Sox historians often {{single out}} Higgins, along with Yawkey, when they discuss {{the root of}} the club's {{reputation}} for resisting racial integration. The Red Sox were the last (in 1959) of the then 16 major league teams to play a black player and fielded an all-white team from Jackie Robinson's Brooklyn Dodger debut in 1947 through Higgins' first managerial term. He was quoted by one Boston baseball writer, the late Al Hirshberg, as saying, [...] "There'll be no niggers on this ball club as long as I <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] He also reportedly called sportswriter Cliff Keane [...] "a fucking nigger-lover" [...] after hearing Keane praise the talents of White Sox outfielder Minnie Miñoso, a Cuban of African descent. The Red Sox' first African American player, utility infielder Pumpsie Green, was recalled from the minor leagues in July 1959, during Jurges' brief tenure as pilot. But Higgins had no control over the big league roster until he became Red Sox manager in 1955, and the club's policy of refusing to break the color line appeared to be in place well before then under Yawkey and his front office bosses, Eddie Collins and Joe Cronin.|$|E
5000|$|Robbie Collin of The Daily Telegraph {{gave the}} film {{five out of}} five stars, stating, [...] "When the film reaches its logical end point, Refn just keeps pushing, and {{eventually}} lands on a sequence so jaw-dropping - almost certainly a sly, glossy-magazine refashioning of Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dali's groundbreaking surrealist short Un Chien Andalou - that {{all you can do}} is howl or cheer." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani, writing for The Philadelphia Inquirer, called Refn a [...] "bold visionary artist... able to revel in the culture of instant gratification while also subjecting it to critique", giving the film three and a half out of four stars and calling it a [...] "brutal masterpiece". Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald wrote positively of the film's visuals and experimental filmmaking, writing, [...] "To complain that The Neon Demon lacks substance or that it doesn't <b>have</b> <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> our cultural obsession with beauty is to miss the crazy, cracked pageant unfolding in front of you. Not all movies are intended to be read like books; some are meant to be experienced," [...] going on to call it a [...] "film that is guaranteed to elicit strong reactions." [...] He awarded the film three out of four stars.|$|E
