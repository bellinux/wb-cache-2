500|$|After the Dawson College {{shooting}} in September 2006, when gunman Kimveer Gill killed one student and injured 19 others, the Toronto Sun wrote that Kimveer had self-reported playing Columbine Massacre {{on a web}} site. The story {{was picked up by}} media and reported widely. Upon hearing media reports of a link to the game one of the shooting victims at Dawson College contacted Ledonne and told him that [...] "I just suffered multiple gunshot wounds and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> take this game down." [...] Ledonne expressed his reaction to the shooting and renewed media attention towards his game in an interview a week later: ...|$|E
500|$|Originally, [...] "Castle Walls" [...] {{belonged to}} Diddy, who had {{commissioned}} the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money. But Diddy told T.I., [...] "Yeah, {{this is my}} record, but you know what, I {{think this is a}} better fit for you. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> rock out on this one. I think this speaks volumes to where you are, what you going through, what you living and how you feel." [...] Consequently, Christina Aguilera was chosen as the featured guest on the song, which appeared on T.I.'s album No Mercy. Alex da Kid, producer of the song, said about the collaboration, [...] "I love it. I think it's amazing. It's my sound, just kind of an evolution of that. I think it'll cater to a lot of different people." [...] T.I. told RapFix Live about the track's inspiration: ...|$|E
500|$|In 2007, after Pearl Jam's 2006 tour had ended, {{the band}} members began {{recording}} demo material on their own while staying in occasional contact via e-mail. Guitarist Mike McCready revealed {{at the time that}} he had tested out some ideas with guitarist Stone Gossard and drummer Matt Cameron in separate sessions as well. After the band was invited to record The Who's [...] "Love, Reign o'er Me" [...] for the Reign Over Me soundtrack, they opted to call long-time collaborator Brendan O'Brien to produce their cover. During the experience, O'Brien and Pearl Jam decided it was a good time for them to work again in a studio album. This ninth album would mark O'Brien's first production credit with Pearl Jam since 1998's Yield. The band allowed O'Brien greater latitude in determining the sound of Backspacer. [...] "At this point, I think we're willing to let somebody cut the songs up a little bit," [...] says lead vocalist Eddie Vedder. [...] "In the past, Brendan would say, 'It's a great song, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do it in a different key', and we'd say no. But now that we've heard Bruce [...] has listened to his suggestions, I think we will too." [...] Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "He brings a brutally honest approach to what he thinks is working and what isn't, and it really moves things along... We don't get weighted down with ideas that maybe aren't even that good. He's one of the few people outside of the band that we trust with our music, and we're really, really looking forward to making this record." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Tijerina was first {{encouraged}} to divert his religious energy into politics. After a sermon in Dallas one day, a man invited him home for lunch. As Tijerina recalls, [...] "He {{said to my}} face, 'I don't like preachers, they {{take advantage of the}} people. What <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> do is quit talking religion. What the Spanish-American people need is a Spanish-American politician, you may be that … you should study law and history and help your people.'" [...] In June 1956, Tijerina and a few bravos went to Monero, New Mexico, to visit a community that had previously welcomed him. [...] There he learned about land grants, a controversial issue regarding Hispanic property rights. [...] Zebedeo Martínez, Zebedeo Valdez, and other elderly men, all members of the Brotherhood of Jesus, shared the story of how their families were dispossessed of their lands. [...] The next day, they took Tijerina's group to Chama, Tierra Amarilla, and Ensenada to meet with other unhappy heirs.|$|E
2500|$|Ulliott took £10,000 {{with him}} on the trip, and was around even, until he entered the $500 pot limit Omaha event of the 1997 Four Queens Poker Classic. When the event reached the heads-up stage, {{numerous}} Vietnamese-American followers of Men Nguyen supported the latter by cheering [...] "Go on the Master" [...] at him. In response, Whitaker cheered Ulliott on by cheering [...] "Go on the Devilfish." [...] The nickname was thought up by Stephen Au-Yeung early 1997, who ran a poker game that Ulliott had frequented in Birmingham UK, who later sold him the website DevilFishPoker.com in 2005; a devilfish (or fugu) is a poisonous fish that can kill when ingested, if not properly prepared. Ulliott reduced Nguyen's stack to one chip, and the tournament director insisted upon still taking a one-hour scheduled break, over Nguyen's protests. Ulliott turned to Nguyen and said, [...] "We’re taking the break, and in all fairness to you, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> go upstairs and think about your tactics." [...] Ulliott went on to win, and the headlines the next day read, Devilfish devours the Master. Since the event, Ulliott claimed that the event was only of significance for defining his nickname.|$|E

2500|$|In 231, a Wu officer Sun Bu (孫布) {{secretly}} sent {{a messenger}} to meet Wang Ling, the Wei inspector of Yang Province, and convey {{his desire to}} defect to Wei. Sun Bu also said in his message: [...] "As we are too far apart from each other, I cannot come to you. You will need to send troops to escort me over." [...] Wang Ling then passed the letter to Man Chong {{and asked him to}} send a convoy of troops to escort Sun Bu to Yang Province. Man Chong suspected that Sun Bu was pretending to defect so he refused and wrote a reply to Sun Bu in Wang Ling's name: [...] "It is good to hear that you have recognised the folly of your ways and now desire to leave your tyrannical government and return to the path of righteousness. This is truly commendable. However, as much as I would like to send troops to escort you over, I do not think it is a good idea. If I send too few troops, {{they will not be able}} to protect you. If I send too many troops, the Wu government will find it suspicious. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> secretly make plans for yourself first and act accordingly when the time comes." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell {{became an}} outspoken {{supporter}} {{of gun control}} and a major figure in the Million Mom March. During the April 19, 1999 broadcast of her talk show, she stated, [...] "You {{are not allowed to}} own a gun, and if you do own a gun, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> go to prison." [...] O'Donnell previously had remarked, [...] "I don't personally own a gun, but if you are qualified, licensed and registered, I have no problem." [...] In May 1999, a month after the Columbine shootings, O'Donnell interviewed Tom Selleck, who was promoting The Love Letter. O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the National Rifle Association (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of [...] "assault weapons." [...] She said {{at the end of the}} segment the conversation had [...] "not gone the way I had hoped" [...] and added [...] "if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today." [...] Around the same time, the cast from Annie Get Your Gun was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line [...] "I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge" [...] from the song [...] "Anything You Can Do" [...] and agreed to perform [...] "My Defenses Are Down" [...] instead.|$|E
2500|$|Aleister Crowley {{had great}} admiration {{for the use of}} the ouija board and it played a passing role in his magical workings. Jane Wolfe, who lived with Crowley at Abbey of Thelema, also used the Ouija board. She credits some of her {{greatest}} spiritual communications to use of this implement. Crowley also discussed the Ouija board with another of his students, and the most ardent of them, Frater Achad (Charles Stansfeld Jones): it is frequently mentioned in their unpublished letters. In 1917 Achad experimented with the board as a means of summoning Angels, as opposed to Elementals. In one letter Crowley told Jones: [...] "Your Ouija board experiment is rather fun. You see how very satisfactory it is, but I believe things improve greatly with practice. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> keep to one angel, and make the magical preparations more elaborate." [...] Over the years, both became so fascinated by the board that they discussed marketing their own design. Their discourse culminated in a letter, dated February 21, 1919, in which Crowley tells Jones, [...] "Re: Ouija Board. I offer you the basis of ten percent of my net profit. You are, if you accept this, responsible for the legal protection of the ideas, and the marketing of the copyright designs. I trust that this may be satisfactory to you. I hope to let you have the material in the course of a week." [...] In March, Crowley wrote to Achad to inform him,"I'll think up another name for Ouija." [...] But their business venture never came to fruition and Crowley's new design, along with his name for the board, has not survived. Crowley has stated, of the Ouija Board that, ...|$|E

[...] Kanye West recorded six songs for the album at Avex Honolulu Studios in Honolulu, Hawaii. T.I. told MTV's Jayson Rodriguez that the song [...] "Castle Walls" [...] (featuring Christina Aguilera) originally belonged to Diddy who had commissioned the song for his fifth album Last Train to Paris with his group Dirty Money.
