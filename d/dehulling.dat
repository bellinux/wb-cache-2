50|$|Husking of corn is {{the process}} of {{removing}} its outer layers, leaving only the cob or seed rack of the corn. <b>Dehulling</b> {{is the process}} of removing the hulls (or chaff) from beans and other seeds. This is sometimes done using a machine known as a huller. To prepare the seeds to have oils extracted from them, they are cleaned to remove any foreign objects. Next, the seeds have their hulls, or outer coverings, or husk, removed. There are three different types of <b>dehulling</b> systems {{that can be used to}} process soybeans: Hot <b>dehulling,</b> warm <b>dehulling</b> and cold <b>dehulling.</b> Hot <b>dehulling</b> is the system offered in areas where beans are processed directly from the field.

40|$|Widespread protein-calorie {{malnutrition}} {{in many countries}} has stimulated interest in direct use of whole soybeans. However, acceptability of this protein/calorie-rich food is limited by several factors such as prolonged cooking time, poor texture and lack of consumer familiarity. Direct use of soybeans might be more acceptable if beans were <b>dehulled</b> prior to use. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to study the cooking quality, nutritive value, sensory characteristics and shelf life of <b>dehulled</b> soybeans in comparison with whole soybeans. The soaking time of whole soybeans was four times greater than that of <b>dehulled</b> soybeans (12 to 3 hr, respectively). Solid losses during soaking were greater for <b>dehulled</b> beans than for whole beans (8. 6 % and 0. 7 %, respectively), but cooking times (5. 9 to 6. 1 hr) were not significantly different. Whether raw or cooked, bean types did not significantly differ for PER, NPR and apparent digestibility. After cooking, there were significant increases in all nutritional parameters studied. Dry <b>dehulled</b> beans were significantly preferred over whole beans, but cooking reversed this preference. Both soybean types were stored in lots of 500 g polyethylene bags up to 6 mo at two environmental conditions (25 °C, 75 % RH, env. l; and 38 °C, 90 % RH, env. 11) and sampled monthly. Moisture content of whole and <b>dehulled</b> beans increased significantly during storage, however, rate of moisture increase was greater when both soybean types were stored under env. II. Cooking time of whole and <b>dehulled</b> beans increased linearly with storage duration. Storage environment affected the rate/extent of this increase (19 %, env. I; 87 %, env. II). Trypsin inhibitor activity decreased during storage; cooking destroyed this activity in all samples. PERs of <b>dehulled</b> beans were reduced by storage under both conditions, whereas those of whole beans were influenced only by env. II. For both soybean types, NPR and apparent digestibility values were independent of storage treatment. Color and odor of dry samples were adversely affected by storage duration under env. II. The increased color associated with storage under env. II. was less pronounced after samples were cooked.

Soy protein isolate is a highly pure form of soy protein with a minimum protein content of 90%.

The oil-free soybean meal is then suspended in water and treated with alkali to dissolve the protein while leaving behind the carbohydrates. The alkaline solution is then treated with acidic substances in order to precipitate the protein, before being washed and dried. The removal of fats and carbohydrates, results in a product that has a relatively neutral flavor.

In the production trial {{no statistically significant differences}} between treatments were found in weight gain (Figure 3). In the latter part of this experiment (November) mink fed 50 % <b>dehulled</b> oats gained even more than did the mink whose diet contained only barley as a cereal source. The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small and not significant (Table 3). Blue fox In the digestibility trial mean final weights of blue foxes were equal in all diets (Figure 1, 7355 - 7687 g). Average daily gain of blue foxes varied between 77. 4 - 81. 5 g. Final average weights varied from 13. 49 to 13. 75 kg (Figure 4). The differences in skin length, weight and characteristics were small (Table 4). Only quard hair quality, in the group 8 % <b>dehulled</b> oats became better than in other groups. Discussion Somewhat poorer weight gain in mink in the groups of 8 and 16 % <b>dehulled</b> oats did ot confirm the results of digestibility trial, where the difference in digestibility was not seen. The preliminary results of the digestibility trial show that both <b>dehulled</b> and naked oats diets were highly digestible. The difference may originate from looser and softer consistencys of <b>dehulled</b> oats diets. <b>Dehulled</b> oats finer particle size (2 mm) resulted in looser and softer consistency and probably led to feed waste from the wire mesh. The problem arose only with mink because the mink cages did not have feeding trays. In contrast, blue fox fed with the same experimental feed gained similarly to other diets. Van Barneveld et. al (1997) also studied digestibility of naked and <b>dehulled</b> oats in growing pigs and found that both <b>dehulled</b> and naked oats have very high amino acid digestibility. These results indicate that both naked and <b>dehulled</b> oats can promote good weight gain both in mink and blue foxes. Naked oats have been included in commercial young pigs diets with positive growth responses. <b>Dehulled</b> and naked oats have even been found very good feed ingredients for dogs. Amino acid content and profile oats is better than in corn Kempe et al. (2004).

40|$|Lupins (Lupinus angustifolius) {{have been}} {{suggested}} as a potential substitute for soybeans in Asian Food. Much {{research has been done}} using lupin as a substitute for soybean in soy milk and tofu. Furthermore lupin is a high protein seed and has a low Glycemic Index and in clinical trials it has been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Therefore the potential of using lupins as a nutraceutical food supplement and additive in Asian Foods is tremendous. Our own investigation has shown that <b>dehulled</b> lupin flour can improve the colour, water absorption, protein level and eating qualities of noodles, and in instant noodles we also see a reduction in fat content. Meat sausages, especially chicken frankfurters are very popular in Asia. Traditionally, soy isolates, concentrates and soy flour are used for cost and functional reasons. We have also investigated the use of <b>dehulled</b> lupin flour in sausage making. The use of <b>dehulled</b> lupins in aquaculture is well documented. In general, <b>dehulled</b> lupin will perform better than soybean meal in most aquatic species. Therefore aquaculture offers the best potential for lupins in animal feeding. However the protein level is not high enough for carnivorous aquatic species. We are researching into making a lupin concentrate. The use of lupin in pig feeding is well documented. Using a <b>dehulled</b> lupin meal processed to maximise nutrient release, we had been able to significantly improve the performance of pigs by replacing 75 % of soybean meal in the diets. Feed Conversion Ratios improved by 16 %. Our experience with the use of <b>dehulled</b> lupin in poultry has not been promising probably due to the high NSP in the lupin...|$|R
40|$|Proximate {{analysis}} of the seeds of Brachystegia eurycoma and Detrarium microcarpum were carried out on both the <b>dehulled</b> and undehulled samples of the flour. The protein content of the seeds are quite low 9. 1; 7. 2 and 11. 4; 8. 2 for undehulled and <b>dehulled</b> Brachystegia eurycoma and Detarium microcarpum, respectively. Crude fibre is less than 3 % in each, while ash was less than 5 % each per 100 gm dry weight of sample. Detarium microcarpum has a higher crude fat composition 18. 5 ± 0. 03, 15. 5 ± 0. 02 while Brachystegia eurycoma 15. 5 ± 0. 04, 14. 0 ± 0. 01 for the undehulled and <b>dehulled</b> samples respectively. Moisture content is higher in <b>dehulled</b> samples 14. 3 ± 0. 01 and 16. 7 ± 0. 03 for both seed types. The available carbohydrate is equally higher in the <b>dehulled</b> samples 59. 0 ± 0. 01 and 57. 0 ± 0. 01, respectively for both seeds. The sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium contents were less than 1 % each, with calcium having the highest concentration, followed by phosphorous. The phytochemical analysis showed the presence of alkaloids, tannins, saponins and flavonoids. Brachystegia eurcoma showed no presence of tannin. The findings are of nutritional relevance since these seeds are used for soup thickening by many homes in the southeastern Nigeria...|$|R
