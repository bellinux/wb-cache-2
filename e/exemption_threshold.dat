We consider progressive capital income tax schedules taking a simple two-bracket form with an exemption bracket at the bottom and a single marginal tax rate above a time varying <b>exemption</b> <b>threshold.</b> Individuals are taxed until their wealth is reduced down to the <b>exemption</b> <b>threshold.</b> When the intertemportal elasticity of substitution is not too large and the top tail of the initial wealth distribution is infinite and thick enough, the optimal <b>exemption</b> <b>threshold</b> converges to a finite limit. As a result, the optimal tax system drives all the large fortunes down a finite level and produces a truncated long-run wealth distribution.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a real options model of an all-equity financed firm that receives mean-reverting earnings and {{is subject to}} progressive taxation. Tax progression arises from an exogenously given tax <b>exemption</b> <b>threshold</b> such that the firm pays no corporate income taxes should its earnings be less than this threshold. The firm possesses a perpetual option to liquidate its operation for a deterministic salvage value at any time. We show that the firm optimally exercises the liquidation option at the first instant when its earnings reach an endogenously determined threshold (the liquidation trigger) from above. Using numerical analysis, we show that the liquidation trigger is higher or lower than the exogenously given tax <b>exemption</b> <b>threshold,</b> {{depending on whether the}} tax exemption is below or above a unique critical level, respectively. We further show that the liquidation trigger is strictly decreasing for all tax exemption thresholds less than the critical level, and can be hump-shaped for all tax exemption thresholds greater than the critical level, especially when the salvage value is small.

40|$|With {{the audit}} <b>exemption</b> <b>thresholds</b> rising in 2006, this poses the {{question}} whether it will have impact on the auditing sector. Presently {{there is a lot of}} interest in this area, with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) in the United Kingdom (UK) launching a consultation exercise on the impact the audit exemption has had on their auditing sector. While the United States (US) has gone under major restructuring to its auditing sector, due to the income from auditing diminishing and the profession had to alter its products. Therefore, this research explores the development of the audit exemption, and the evolution and progression of the auditing sector. The purpose of this research is to determine why the audit exemption was established and to investigate its impact on the auditing industry. It also investigates if the auditing sector has developed alternatives services that could be provided to the public. The researcher did an extensive literature search on the area audit exemption and sent questionnaires the top twenty accounting firms. The researcher also interviewed the three Irish accounting bodies to discover their views on the area. The literature shows there is a shift in the activities being performed by auditors internationally. Professional bodies have responded to the changing environment by updating the professional practices framework and expanding the skills and knowledge required to provide assurance in the future. The research has found that more than 50 percent of respondents felt an impact from the recent rise in audit thresholds, with 40 percent of respondents revenue decreasing and 50 percent saying it had decreased the number of audits performed by them. This research has also identified a clear gap for providing alternative services to the audit, such as assurance services, with 90 percent of respondents feeling they could be provided in Ireland. However, the demand for the services was highlighted as a concern by the accounting bodies. In conclusion, the top twenty accounting bodies have felt an impact by the recent rise in the audit <b>exemption</b> <b>thresholds,</b> and this research has identified potential alternative services...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} {{on the concept of}} ‘essential derivation’ which refers to the {{situation}} where the breeder of one variety – the ‘initial variety’ – claims that another breeder has developed a second variety – the ‘putative essentially derived variety’ – that is virtually the same as the initial variety.

In examining the concept of essential derivation, this article first looks at the general trends in plant breeding techniques.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of tax evasion and their implications for tax policy, with a special focus on taxation in developing countries. Chapter 1 studies how the transition from self-employment to employee-jobs {{over the long run}} of development explains the rise of the modern tax system. I construct a new microdataset, covering 90 countries at all levels of development today and 140 years within the US between 1870 and 2010. Using these data, I provide new stylized facts: within country, the share of employees increases over the income distribution, and increases at all levels of income as a country develops; 2) the income tax <b>exemption</b> <b>threshold</b> moves down the income distribution as a country develops tracking employee growth. I provide a causal estimate of the impact of employee-share on the <b>exemption</b> <b>threshold</b> and on tax revenue, by studying a state-led development program which was implemented across US states in the 1950 s- 60 s. I find that the exogenous increase in employee share is associated with a lower state income tax threshold and higher revenue. Chapter 2 studies individual and social motives in tax evasion. We build a dynamic model that incorporates these motives, their interactions, and where social motives underpin the role of norms. Our empirical analysis exploits the adoption in 1990 of a poll tax to fund local government in the UK, which led to widespread evasion, and a series of natural experiments due to narrow election outcomes, which induce shifts into single-majority local governments and lead to more vigorous enforcement of local taxes. The econometric results are consistent with the model’s main predictions on the dynamics of evasion. Chapter 3 studies the impact of access to formal finance and firm size on tax inspection and tax compliance. We use firm-level data on 108, 000 firms across 79 countries in the World Bank Enterprise Surveys.

We find a large and positive effect of firm size on both tax inspection and sales tax compliance, but no overall significant impact of reliance on external finance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{prospects}} for income tax reform in China during the coming decade (with a comparison to India), and argues that such reforms should rank high on the policy agenda in these two countries. Due to high average income growth and sharply rising top income shares during the 1990 s and early 2000 s, progressive income taxation is about to raise non-trivial tax revenues in China and India and to become an important political object. According to our projections, the income tax should raise at least 4 % of Chinese GDP in 2010 (versus less than 1 % in 2000 and 0, 1 % in 1990), {{in spite of the}} 20 % nominal rise in the <b>exemption</b> <b>threshold</b> that took effect in 2004. The fact that progressive income taxation is becoming an important policy tool has important consequences for China’s ability to finance social spending and to keep under control the rise in income inequality associated to globalization and growth.

40|$|After a {{long period}} of {{universal}} mandatory audit, the UK reduced the regulatory burden of private firms by introducing size-based audit exemption in 1994; the size thresholds have subsequently been progressively increased. Both accounting bodies and credit rating agencies have expressed reservations about this policy, arguing it could diminish user confidence in reported accounting numbers, and lead to a reduction in financial statement quality and credit ratings. Prior research, however, suggests that the managers of small UK companies do not perceive there to be an association between financial statement audit and firm credit score. To provide evidence of any effect on user confidence of making audit optional, we examine the credit scores and financial reporting quality of a large sample of UK private firms which qualified for audit <b>exemption</b> after major <b>threshold</b> changes in 2004. We find that, even though they report lower average profits, companies which retain a voluntary audit enjoy significantly higher credit scores than those which opt out of audit. The results of both conservatism and accruals-based tests indicate that opting out of audit is associated with less conservative financial reporting, consistent with the concerns of the accounting bodies and the credit rating agencies, and providing an explanation for why opt out firms report higher profits but receive lower credit scores. This study contributes to an important policy debate by providing large sample evidence that the audit does confer benefits to private firms in terms of financial reporting quality, assurance, and the credit scores generated from the financial reports...|$|R
40|$|Co-payments are {{a common}} {{instrument}} of health insurers to lower their pharmaceutical expenses and to share costs with consumers, the pa- tients. Tiered drug co-payments, e. g. lower co-payments for generic drugs, incentivize patients to buy certain products and, hence, steer drug con- sumption patterns. Since 2007, the German Statutory Health Insurance follows an innovative and unique regulation by dierentiating drug co- payments by the drug's price relative to its reference price. Co-payment exemption thresholds have been introduced in 185 out of 281 therapeutic clusters since 2007. We answer how eective this co-payment exemption policy is {{in order to reduce}} overall prices for pharmaceutical products. We analyze prices of all drugs marketed in reference price clusters and be- ing subject to the policy in Germany using quarterly data from January 2007 to October 2010 published by the Federal Association of Statutory Health Insurance Funds in Germany.
