50|$|Charles Turner Warren {{was born}} in London, and of his early career the only facts {{recorded}} are that he married {{at the age of}} eighteen, and was at one time engaged in <b>engraving</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> for calico printing.

His engraved plates of Robert Smirke in the English editions of the Arabian Nights (1802), Gil Blas (1809), and Don Quixote (1818), were very successful. His Broken Jar (after David Wilkie), one of the illustrations to poet Peter Coxe's Social Day, was considered a masterpiece of its kind.|$|R
50|$|In 1472, {{they applied}} to Pope Sixtus IV for Church benefices. From this {{we know that}} both were ecclesiastics: Pannartz of Cologne and Sweinheim of Mainz. The pope had a {{reversion}} drawn up for them, a proof of his great interest in printing. In 1474, Sweinheim was made a canon at St. Victor at Mainz. It is not known whether Pannartz also obtained benefice. Perhaps the pope also aided them; at any rate, they printed eighteen more works in 1472 and 1473. After this they separated. Pannartz printed by himself thirteen further volumes. Sweinheim took up <b>engraving</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> and executed the fine maps for the Cosmography of Ptolemy, the first work of this kind, but died before he had finished his task.|$|R
50|$|Myra {{introduced}} a new technique of <b>engraving</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal,</b> utilizing acids, but printed from the surface, called Metal Relief.

Her Metal Relief works were well received by art critic Paul Westheim in the important magazine El Nuevo Arte de los Metales and by art connoisseur, reviewer and historian Jorge Olvera. She continued her in-depth research and found her definitive expression in painting with pastel on raw linen. In this technique she was a pioneer. Her thematic approach was also new: she was the first Latin American abstract painter to use movements of free geometrical lines. All her works since 1965 are called Rhythms.|$|R

50|$|Giorgio Vasari claims Finiguerra {{invented the}} printmaking {{technique}} of engraving (using that word in its popular sense of taking impressions on paper from designs <b>engraved</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> plates to create prints). This {{made him a}} crucial figure {{in the history of}} old master prints and remained widely believed until the early twentieth century. However, it was gradually realised that Vasari's view, like many of his assertions as to the origins of technical advances, could not be sustained. Typically, Vasari had overstated the importance of a fellow-Florentine, and a fellow-Italian, since {{it is now clear that}} engraving developed in Germany before Italy. Although he clearly was an important artist of his time, few surviving works, and no surviving prints, can now be definitely attributed to him, so scholarly interest in him has greatly reduced.|$|R
5000|$|Dedicated to {{stopping}} counterfeiters, Ormsby {{invented the}} “grammagraph", a machine used to copy medals and medallions onto bank note dies {{in order to}} give the illusion of a bas-relief. The device was later used as a pantographic engraving machine to produce [...] "roll-die" [...] <b>engraving</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal.</b> The machine automated an existing engraving technique that varied spaces between parallel contour lines to give the impression of depth to a print. In Ormsby's case this was most famously used on the cylinders of revolvers made by Samuel Colt of Colt Firearms. Ormsby produced half a dozen engraving scenes for Colt as early as 1839 and these were featured on models such as the Colt Walker, Colt Dragoon Revolver, Colt Model 1849 Pocket Revolver, Colt 1851 Navy Revolver, and Colt Model 1855 Sidehammer Pocket Revolver.|$|R

50|$|<b>Engraving</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> {{was part}} of the goldsmith's craft {{throughout}} the Medieval period, and the idea of printing engraved designs onto paper probably began as a method for them to record the designs on pieces they had sold. Some artists trained as painters became involved from about 1450-1460, although many engravers continued to come from a goldsmithing background. From the start, engraving was {{in the hands of the}} luxury tradesmen, unlike woodcut, where at least the cutting of the block was associated with the lower-status trades of carpentry, and perhaps sculptural wood-carving. Engravings were also important from very early on as models for other artists, especially painters and sculptors, and many works survive, especially from smaller cities, which take their compositions directly from prints. Serving as a pattern for artists may have been a primary purpose for the creation of many prints, especially the numerous series of apostle figures.|$|R

50|$|John Alais, {{like his}} near contemporary, Francesco Bartolozzi, used the stipple {{technique}} {{which was a}} mixture of etching and <b>engraving</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> plates, using a roulette, a punch and a curved burin for flickwork. This gave a softer and more subtle effect than the line technique mostly employed by the cartoonists of the time such as Thomas Rowlandson and James Gilray. He seems to have worked with various artists including George Cruikshank and Adam Buck, but at least between 1802 and 1815 was published almost exclusively by John Roach of The Britannia Office, Russell Court, Drury Lane, London. He became known for producing portraits of actors and actresses, particularly those appearing at the Drury Lane and Covent Garden theatres, thus leaving a large contribution to the history of London theatre. However, he was sought for reproduction of their works which would increase their income.

60|$|And {{you will}} observe {{that the only}} {{engravings}} which bear imperishable value are, indeed, in this kind. It is true that, in wood-cutting, both Dürer and Holbein, as in our own days Leech and Tenniel, have workmen under them who can do all they want. But in metal cutting it is not so. For, as I have told you, in metal cutting, ultimate perfection of Line has to be reached; {{and it can be}} reached by none but a master's hand; nor by his, unless in the very moment and act of designing. Never, unless under the vivid first force of imagination and intellect, can the Line have its full value. And for this high reason, gentlemen, that paradox which perhaps seemed to you so daring, is nevertheless deeply and finally true, that while a woodcut may be laboriously finished, a grand <b>engraving</b> <b>on</b> <b>metal</b> must be comparatively incomplete.

Decoration was first based on Greek mythology, before hunting and circus scenes became popular, as well as imagery drawn from the Old and New Testament. It appears to have been used to mimic the appearance of precious metal wares during the same period, including the application of gold leaf, and could be cut free-hand or with lathes. As many as twenty separate stylistic workshops have been identified, and {{it seems likely that the}} engraver and vessel producer were separate craftsmen.|$|R

The central text (or libretto) on which the artwork is based derives from the principal clause of the Second Commandment, forbidding graven images (Exodus 20. 4). The term ?graven? (Hebrew: pesel) means ?to engrave?. Here, the clause ? taken from the Welsh Bible (1588) and Authorised Version (1611) ? sonified in three ways: 1.
