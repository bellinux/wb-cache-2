5|$|Another {{definition}} of the GCD is helpful in advanced mathematics, particularly ring theory. The greatest common divisor g of two nonzero numbers a and b is also their smallest positive integral linear combination, that is, the smallest positive number of the form ua+vb where u and v are integers. The set of all integral linear combinations of a and b is actually {{the same as the}} set of all multiples of g (mg, where m is an integer). In modern mathematical language, the <b>ideal</b> generated by a and b is the <b>ideal</b> generated byg alone (an <b>ideal</b> generated by a single element is called a principal <b>ideal,</b> and all ideals of the integers are principal ideals). Some properties of the GCD are in fact easier to see with this description, for instance the fact that any common divisor of a and b also divides the GCD (it divides both terms of ua+vb). The equivalence of this GCD definition with the other definitions is described below.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{two families}} of <b>ideals,</b> F-jumping <b>ideals</b> and F-Jacobian <b>ideals,</b> {{in order to}} study the singularities of hypersurfaces in positive characteristic. Both families are defined using the D-modules M_α that were introduced by Blickle, Mustaţă and Smith. Using strong connections between F-jumping <b>ideals</b> and generalized test <b>ideals,</b> we give a characterization of F-jumping numbers for hypersurfaces. Furthermore, we give an algorithm that determines whether certain numbers are F-jumping numbers. In addition, we use F-Jacobian <b>ideals</b> to study intrinsic properties of the singularities of hypersurfaces. In particular, we give conditions for F-regularity. Moreover, F-Jacobian <b>ideals</b> behave similarly to Jacobian <b>ideals</b> of polynomials. Using techniques developed to study these two new families of <b>ideals,</b> we provide relations among test <b>ideals,</b> generalized test <b>ideals,</b> and generalized Lyubeznik numbers for hypersurfaces.

5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using <b>ideal</b> strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with <b>ideal</b> pulleys, which allow <b>ideal</b> strings to switch physical direction. <b>Ideal</b> strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an <b>ideal</b> string, any force directed along the string by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E
