40|$|<b>Erythromycin</b> <b>acistrate</b> {{is a new}} 2 '-acetyl esther prodrug of erythromycin, whose {{structure}} {{resembles that}} of erythromycin estolate. However, in toxicological studies, {{it does not have}} the problems of hepatotoxicity. To assess its effects on hepatic functions in clinical practice, the liver parameters of patients with respiratory tract or skin infections were monitored during therapy. In total 1549 patients were treated for 7 - 14 days. In addition, 127 patients with suspected viral infections served as controls. There {{were no significant differences in}} serum aspartate aminotransferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), gamma-glutamyltransferase (y-GT) or alkaline phosphatase (APHOS) values between the <b>erythromycin</b> <b>acistrate</b> or control groups at the beginning or end of therapy. ASAT values increased moderately in 2 - 4 % and clearly in 0 - 3 % of patients treated, but also decreased in 20 %. ALAT values were moderately increased in 9 - 9 %, clearly increased in 0 - 6 % and normalized in 3 - 5 % of the patients. y-GT values increased moderately in 3 - 5 % and clearly in 0 - 3 %, but decreased to normal in 3 - 3 % of the patients. APHOS was moderately elevated in 1 - 0 % of the patients and normalized in 1 - 3 %. The correlation of changes between the different liver enzymes was poor. Only ten patients (0 - 6 %) had two or more clearly elevated liver enzyme values by the end of the therapy, of whom five had increased liver enzyme activities before the treatment, two had underlying disease explaining the changes and in only three patients out of 1549 (0 - 2 %) could hepatic changes be attributed to <b>erythromycin</b> <b>acistrate</b> therapy. These changes were reversible. The results demonstrate the hepatic safety of <b>erythromycin</b> <b>acistrate</b> in clinical practice. Concomitant food intake did not affect the safety profile...|$|E
40|$|The {{hepatotoxicity}} {{of a new}} erythromydn derivative, <b>erythromycin</b> <b>acistrate</b> (EA, 2 '-acetyl erythromydn stearate), {{was compared}} with that of erythromydn stearate (ES), erythromydn estolate (EE) and erythromydn- 11, 12 cyclic carbonate (EC) in 4 - 5 -day, 28 -day and 6 -month oral toxidty studies in rats and dogs. In the 4 -day rat study, EC caused fatty metamorphosis in the liver. ES caused similar, but milder changes at a dose nearly five times higher. The 5 -day dog study revealed markedly increased serum alanine aminotransferase (S-ALAT), serum aspartate aminotransferase (S-ASAT), serum alkaline phosphatase (S-APHOS) and serum y-glutamyl transpeptidase (S-y-GT) values in the EC- and EE-groups, and slightly elevated S-ALAT values also in the EA- and ES-groups. Microscopy revealed cholangitis, pericholangitis and phlebitis in the portal areas in the EC-group at all doses. Epithelial hyperplasia was observed also in the bile ducts. EE caused similar but milder changes. The changes in the EA-group were small, but mildly atypical bile duct epithelium was seen in female dogs receiving 2 x 200 mg/kg of EA. The ES-group was practically without changes and very much like the EA-group. Thu...|$|E
40|$|The {{concentrations}} of erythromycin, 2 '-acetylerythromycin (2 '-AE) and their anhydro forms in plasma and tonsillar tissue were analyzed after a 3 -day repeated-dosage regimen of erythromycin stearate (ES; 500 mg {{twice a day}} [b. i. d]) and <b>erythromycin</b> <b>acistrate</b> (EA), a new erythromycin prodrug, at two doses (400 and 500 mg b. i. d.). The tonsils of 40 patients were removed at 112 to 329 min after intake of the last dose. Blood samples were collected {{at the time of}} tonsillectomy and at 0, 2, and 6 h after the last dose. At all time points, EA produced severalfold more total antibiotic (erythromycin + 2 '-AE) concentrations in plasma compared with ES. There were two nonabsorbers in the ES group, but none in the two EA groups. The mean total antibiotic levels in tonsillar tissue after EA treatment exceeded the levels after treatment with ES by a factor of 3 (for EA at 400 mg b. i. d.) and 4. 5 (for EA at 500 mg b. i. d.). The ratios of erythromycin concentration in tonsil to that in plasma at the time of tissue removal were quite similar for all groups (means, 0. 51 to 0. 54). In the EA groups, 2 of 26 (8 %) patients had no measurable erythromycin in the tonsillar tissue samples, whereas in the ES group, 3 of 14 (21 %) patients had no measurable erythromycin in the same tissue. The degree of hydrolysis of 2 '-AE to erythromycin was about 25 % in plasma at the time of tonsillectomy for both EA groups and about 40 % in tonsillar tissue. There were negligible amounts of anhydro forms in plasma after EA administration, whereas in the ES group, anhydroerythromycin levels were, from time to time, even higher than erythromycin levels. Very high levels of anhydro forms were detected in tonsillar tissue after ES treatment, whereas only low levels were found after EA administration...|$|E
