40|$|In {{order to}} {{estimate}} investments from mine to end user (excluding automobiles), or {{to assess the}} rates of potential development of the synthetic fuels industry, {{it is necessary to}} consider all phases of the fuel cycles involved in the development. They include exploration for the resources, their mining, local transportation, beneficiation, transportation to conversion plants, conversion of the energy resources to fuels, and finally, their distribution to end users. Figures 2. 1 and 2. 2 (modified from <b>Reference</b> <b>No.</b> 7) describe in a schematic manner the involved in the case of coal conversion and of oil shale 2. 2 Coal and Oil Shale Resources energy systems retorting. Coal and oil shale resources are defined as those deposits “that can be extracted and processed to yield products that can be marketed at a profit ” (<b>Reference</b> <b>No.</b> 8). Estimates of resources are not limited by whether or not the deposits have been demonstrated, or whether they are extractable by existing technologies at competitive economic costs. If the resource has been demonstrated (i. e. its location, quality, and quantity have been determined by evidence supported by measuements) and its extraction is economically feasible, then it is classified as a reserve. Resources may become reserves as a result of changes in technical or economic development. The major coal and oil shale resources of the coterminous United States are shown in Figure 2. 3 (<b>Reference</b> <b>No.</b> 9) and 2. 4 (<b>Reference</b> <b>No.</b> 8). The United States reserves and resources of coal are estimated as 178 and 1, 285 billion metric tons (<b>Reference</b> <b>No.</b> 10). Other estimates vary widely, depending on economic and technical assumptions. For example a recent estimate of recoverable reserves of coal (<b>Reference</b> <b>No.</b> 11) places them at 38, 000 quads 2 or equivalent to 150 billion metric tons of coal.
