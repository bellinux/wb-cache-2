5|$|The emperor Constantine I {{created the}} scholae {{to replace the}} old praetorian guard. The scholae were his {{personal}} guard, and were mainly equipped as cavalry. Vogt suggests that the scholae formed two small central reserves (Latin: scholae) held to the strategic rear <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> comitatenses, one each {{in the presence of}} the emperors of West and East respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{voracious}} {{adults have}} very broad diets, including insects such as crickets, larvae, mosquito wrigglers, dragonflies, earthworms, cockroaches, flies, and grasshoppers. They are also known to eat freshwater crayfish and slugs, and other frogs, <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same species. They {{have a strong}} tendency for cannibalism, and frequently these in the same enclosure devour each other. Studies and trials in the wild have shown cannibalism also occurs in the wild.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at this extraordinary picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E

5|$|Because the {{territorial}} boundary {{line between the}} U.S. and British North America (specifically, the province of Quebec until 1791 and Upper Canada thereafter) ran {{through the middle of}} Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 Ohio Constitution believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the Maumee River, and possibly <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Detroit River. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes via Lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte's {{position}} as First Consul was {{strengthened by the}} successful outcome of the battle and the preceding campaign. After this victory, Napoleon could breathe a sigh of relief. The generals who had been hostile to him could see that his luck had not abandoned him. Thus, he had surpassed Schérer, Joubert, Championnet, and even Moreau, none {{of whom had been}} able to inflict a decisive blow on the Coalition. Moreau's victory at Hohenlinden, which was the one that in reality had {{put an end to the}} war, was minimised by Bonaparte who, from then on, would pose as a saviour of the fatherland, and <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Republic. He rejected offers from Louis XVIII, who had considered the Consulate to be a mere transition towards the restoration of the king. Thanks to the victory at Marengo, Napoleon could finally set about reforming France according to his own vision.|$|E
5|$|Muslims of Bombay elected Jinnah, though then {{absent in}} London, as their {{representative}} to the Central Legislative Assembly in October 1934. The British Parliament's Government of India Act 1935 gave considerable power to India's provinces, with a weak central parliament in New Delhi, which had no authority over such matters as foreign policy, defence, {{and much of the}} budget. Full power remained {{in the hands of the}} Viceroy, however, who could dissolve legislatures and rule by decree. The League reluctantly accepted the scheme, though expressing reservations about the weak parliament. The Congress was much better prepared for the provincial elections in 1937, and the League failed to win a majority <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Muslim seats in any of the provinces where members of that faith held a majority. It did win a majority of the Muslim seats in Delhi, but could not form a government anywhere, though it was part of the ruling coalition in Bengal. The Congress and its allies formed the government even in the North-West Frontier Province (N.W.F.P.), where the League won no seats despite the fact that almost all residents were Muslim.|$|E

25|$|Several critics {{notice the}} {{fundamental}} {{rhythm of the}} story, a rhythm of tension and relief simultaneously characteristic of the sentences, the state of mind of Captain Delano (the center of consciousness of the tale), and <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure of the novella as a whole.|$|E
25|$|He {{studied at}} the seminary at Homerton, London. Being a staunch nonconformist, and {{inclined}} {{in favor of a}} republican form of government, he wrote articles which attracted attention, <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cabinet ministry of that day. He took part in the growing discussions regarding slavery and slave-trade, along with the Wilberforces, Clarksons, Buxtons, and their compeers.|$|E
25|$|When Gladstone came to {{know him}} in later years, he was {{astonished}} to find that Parnell was ignorant <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic facts of Irish history. The romantic vision that characterised Young Ireland and the Fenians escaped him completely. He knew little of figures like Sarsfield, Tone or Emmett and even appeared unsure of who won the Battle of the Boyne.|$|E

25|$|By 1961 Spencer's {{days as a}} {{first-class}} player were drawing to a close, and he appeared only twice that season, although he continued to turn out regularly for the Second XI. After that season, however, he dropped out <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second team, although he did make a very brief comeback at that level in 1968 when he played one match against Surrey seconds.|$|E
25|$|Amendment 2's reach may not {{be limited}} to {{specific}} laws passed for the benefit of gays and lesbians. It is a fair, if not necessary, inference from the broad language of the amendment that it deprives gays and lesbians <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> protection of general laws and policies that prohibit arbitrary discrimination in governmental and private settings....The state court did not decide whether the amendment has this effect, however, and neither need we.|$|E
25|$|Saussure carried {{barometers}} and boiling-point thermometers to {{the summits}} {{of the highest}} mountains, and estimated the relative humidity of the atmosphere at different heights, its temperature, the strength of solar radiation, the composition of air and its transparency.

25|$|Empirical {{research}} has shown that attenuation in optical fiber is caused primarily by both scattering and absorption. Single-mode optical fibers can be made with extremely low loss. Corning's SMF-28 fiber, a standard single-mode fiber for telecommunications wavelengths, has a loss of 0.17dB/km at 1550nm. For example, an 8km length of SMF-28 transmits nearly 75% of light at 1,550nm. It has been noted that if ocean water was as clear as fiber, one could see {{all the way to the}} bottom <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean, a depth of 36,000 feet.|$|E
25|$|While on {{a mission}} to the Gamma Quadrant, Worf was {{captured}} by the Dominion and sent to a Jem'Hadar prison camp where he met the real General Martok and was reunited with the real Dr. Bashir, who had both been captured and replaced by changelings. While the prisoners worked to escape, Worf entered a daily round of combat with each of the guards in turn. He earned the respect and admiration of Martok and <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guards because he would not yield. Once the prisoners escaped, they managed to warn the station about the Bashir-changeling.|$|E
25|$|Troussay has, {{other than}} the aspect of Renaissance manor, a second center of interest: that of the Solognot field, {{cultivated}} {{until the middle of}} the 20th century by an almost completely autonomous community. The two commons buildings made it possible to house the farm personnel and the animals (pigs, bovines, horses, asses), and thus storing the reserves of food and manufacturing wine, bread, etc. Nowadays, the museum of the Sologne, rich with many agricultural elements and everyday life of the 19th century, and <b>even</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> screw pitch of the press used in the 16th century, recalls this aspect of daily life in Troussay.|$|E
