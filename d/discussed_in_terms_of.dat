5|$|The {{sociology}} {{of race and}} of ethnic relations is {{the area of the}} discipline that studies the social, political, and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society. This area encompasses the study of racism, residential segregation, and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. This research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology, as well as with postcolonial theory. At the level of political policy, ethnic relations are <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> either assimilationism or multiculturalism. Anti-racism forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
5|$|Yajnavalkya dedicates {{significant}} amount of text to explain the art of mastering each stage of breathing, that is inhalation, exhalation and stoppage between the two. Each stage is <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> its nature, speed, duration, depth on its own and relative to the other stage of breathing, regulating these at will during asanas meant for cleansing body or mind. In order to keep time for each stage without distraction, he recommends silently reciting time-measured mantras or sound beats to help measure each stage and thus establish progress during the yoga. The mantras for internal time measurement mentioned include Pranava (Om), Gayatri with Vyahritis, or Gayatri with Siras.|$|E

5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E

Auditory stimuli presented in the womb can be retained and recognized (learned) into the days following birth and that learning is specific to familiar auditory stimuli. Measuring learning and memory in the fetus has only been <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> healthy pregnancies; however, many factors such as disease affect these delicate processes.|$|E

In some cases federal or state statutes may preempt tort actions, which is particularly <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the U.S. FDA Preemption; although actions in the United States for medical devices are preempted due to Riegel v.

25|$|Scholars {{have long}} {{recognized}} that Amos utilized an ancient hymn within his prophecy, verses {{of which are}} found at 4.13; 5.8–9; 8.8; 9.5–6. This hymn is best understood as praising YHWH for His judgment, demonstrated in His destructive power, rather than praise for creation. Scholarship has also identified 'Sumerian City Lament' (SCL) motifs within Amos and particularly the hymn, offering the possibility that Amos used SCL as a literary template for his prophecy of Jerusalem's destruction. The Amos hymn has also been <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> a 'covenant curse' which was used to warn Israel {{of the consequences of}} breaking the covenant, and in particular a 'Flood covenant-curse' motif, first identified by D.R.

25|$|According to the WHO, {{all humans}} {{are exposed to}} some level of mercury. Factors that {{determine}} whether health effects occur and their severity include the type of mercury concerned (methylmercury and ethylmercury, commonly found in fish, being more serious than elemental mercury); the dose; the age or developmental stage of the person exposed (the foetus is most susceptible); the duration of exposure; and the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion or dermal contact). The universal standard for examining mercury toxicity is usually <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> the amount of mercury in the bloodstream for short-term exposure or the amount of mercury excreted in the urine relative to creatine for long-term mercury exposure. Elemental mercury (which is a component of amalgam) is absorbed very differently than methylmercury (which is found in fish). The exposure to mercury from amalgam restorations depends on the number and size of restorations, composition, chewing habits, food texture, grinding, brushing of teeth, and many other physiological factors.|$|E

500|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} gallium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of bauxite, sulfidic zinc ores (and coal) extracted per year. Therefore, its availability needs to be <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> <b>of</b> supply potential.

Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of gallium will be possible without significant increases in production costs or price.
