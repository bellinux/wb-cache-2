It is psychophysically well justified since it is consistent with several human visual perception laws and characteristics. It is mathematically and computationally relevant since it allows to consider color images as vectors in an abstract linear space, contrary to the classical color spaces (e. g., RGB and L∗a∗b∗). The first purpose of this book chapter is to present the mathematical fundamentals of the CoLIP together with its main psychophysical connections (Grasmann’s law, color matching functions, chromaticity diagram and the Maxwell triangle). The second purpose is to present some basic image processing and analysis techniques for contrast enhancement (histogram <b>equalization,</b> dynamic <b>range</b> maximization, toggle contrast calculation), white balance correction, color transfer, K-means clustering and filtering.

In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments.

40|$|In view of {{the fact}} that the {{phosphorus}} atom in its low co-ordination state (coordination numbers 1 and 2) has been termed as the carbon copy, there have been attempts to investigate, theoretically as well as experimentally, the effect of the exchange(s) of CH- moiety with phosphorus atom(s) (CH/P) on the structural and other aspects of the classical carbocyclic and heterocyclic systems. Tropylium ion is a well-known non-benzenoid aromatic system and has been studied extensively for its aromatic character. We have now investigated the effect of mono- and poly-CH/P exchange(s) on the aromaticity of the tropylium ion. For this purpose, the parameters based on the geometry and magnetic properties, namely bond equalization, aromatic stabilization energies (ASE), Nucleus-Independent Chemical Shift (NICS) values, (NICS(0), NICS(1), NICS(1) zz), proton nucleus magnetic resonance (1 H-NMR) chemical shifts, magnetic susceptibility exaltation and magnetic anisotropic values of mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-phosphatropylium ions have been determined at the Density Functional Theory (DFT) (B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 +G(d)) level. Geometry optimization reveals bond length <b>equalization.</b> ASEs <b>range</b> from − 46. 3 kcal/mol to − 6. 2 kcal/mol in mono- and diphospha-analogues which are planar. However, the ions having three and four phosphorus atoms lose planarity and their ASE values approach the values typical for non-aromatic structures. Of the three NICS values, the NICS(1) zz is consistently negative showing aromatic character of all the systems studied. It is also supported by the magnetic susceptibility exaltations and magnetic anisotropic values. Furthermore, 1 H-NMR chemical shifts also fall in the aromatic region. The conclusion that mono-, di-, tri- and tetra-phosphatropylium ions are aromatic in nature has been further corroborated by determining the energy gap between the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) and Lowest Unoccupied Molecular Orbital (LUMO) (HOMO − LUMO gap), which falls in the range, ca. 3 × 10 − 19 – 9 × 10 − 19 J.

40|$|Abstract—In various {{applications}} of RFID systems a reader should reliably get the ID of the tags that are within a bounded proximity region, termed the interrogation zone. This {{gives rise to}} two types of errors 1) False Negative Detections (FNDs), when tags within the intended interrogation zone cannot be read and 2) False Positive Detections (FPDs), when tags outside the zone can be read. The detuning effect experienced from the object a tag is attached to exacerbates the occurrence of FND. Solving FNDs by increasing the reader power increase the probability of FPDs for tags outside the zone. Hence, the design of an interrogation zone poses a trade-off between readability inside versus outside the desired zone. We present a novel method to reduce the probability of FNDs and FPDs, and practically equalize the achievable range for tags experiencing detuning. We propose to impose intentional interference on the communication between reader and tag. The expected effects of the proposed method are evaluated using experimental measurements. The results are positive, showing a sharp edge of the interrogation zone, and a strong <b>equalization</b> of the <b>range</b> of tuned and detuned tags. Hence it is concluded that by imposing interference enables design of well-defined interrogation zones for passive RFID systems. I...|$|R

40|$|Sound spatialization is a natural, {{intuitive}} but sparsely researched {{topic in}} multi-track audio mixing. Although {{a lot of}} research has been devoted to the automatic fader gain settings, addition of dynamic <b>range</b> <b>equalization</b> and related effects, delay and Reverb have taken a backseat. The dichotomy in the artistic and engineering approaches to audio mixing have resulted in studio best practices not given their due with suitable algorithmic interpretations. Due regard to studio practices along with a more holistic approach combining all the steps of audio mixing are especially necessary in the background of the exponential growth of bedroom studio producers and musicians, mixing and crafting their tracks personally. The additional growth in the availability of faster personal computing only fuels this trend. This thesis attempts to be an exploratory foray into the addition of Reverb to production oriented multi-track mixing. Taking into account studio practices, 2 different algorithms are compared with a professionally mixed track and an unreverberated reference track. The results from hidden reference listening tests are analyzed to draw conclusions of the effectiveness of automatic methods of Reverb addition against the professionally mixed track. The results suggest that the current algorithms implemented are unable to reach the subjective perceptual quality of the professionally mixed track. However, some important conclusions are drawn from the theoretical and experimental research which provide clear guidelines for possible future implementations. Electrical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} effects of equalization on Arizona unified school districts. Data was collected from three time spans, 1979 to 1981, {{the period of time}} before the passage of equalization legislation; 1982 to 1986 the period of time that equalization took place; and 1987 and 1988 the period after equalization was to have been fully realized. The study uses six measurements of <b>equalization.</b> The <b>Range</b> of Revenue per student was found to indicate a slight in inequality. The Federal Restricted Range Ratio also indicated a slight trend toward inequity. Inequity has decreased from 1. 79 in 1979 to 1. 47 in 1988. The data became erratic during the period of time that equalization was taking place. Both the Range of revenue and the Federal Restricted Range Ratio are relatively invalid measurements of equity. The Coefficient of Variation, a much better measure, indicated on overall trend toward increased equity. The Coefficient of Variation was. 35 in 1979 and. 29 in 1988. The McLoone Index, a widely used measure of equity, indicated that the State of Arizona has had a high degree of equity throughout the study; it was. 92 in 1979 and. 91 in 1988. The Lorenz Curves that were produced and the Gini Coefficients gave further indication that the State has had substantial equity throughout the study. In 1979, the Gini Coefficient was. 04 and. 03 in 1989. The results of the data indicate that there was little effect on equalization of unified districts in Arizona from the passage of HB 2013 in 1980. Immediately after the passage of the law, the data became more erratic, but equity did not increase substantially. The reason there was little effect on equity is thought to be because the degree of equity as measured by the Coefficient of Variation, McLoone Index, and the Gini Coefficient was so great that any increase in equity would be very difficult. The McLoone Index indicated equity was within 12 % of perfect equity and the Gini Coefficient indicated equity was within from 1 % to 4 % of perfect equity...|$|R
40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{the contrast}} enhancement of images, {{based on the}} theory of Partitioned Iterated Function System (PIFS), is presented. A PIFS consists of contractive transformations, such that the original image is the fixed point of the union of these transformations. Each transformation involves the contractive affine spatial transform of a square block, {{as well as the}} linear transform of the gray levels of its pixels. The transformation of the gray levels is determined by two parameters which adjust the brightness and the contrast of the transformed block. The PIFS is used {{in order to create a}} lowpass version of the original image. The contrast-enhanced image is obtained by adding the difference of the original image with its lowpass version, to the original image itself. The proposed algorithm uses a predefined constant value for the contrast parameter, whereas, the parameters of the affine spatial transform, as well as the parameter adjusting the brightness, are calculated using k-dimensional trees. The lowpass version of the original image is obtained applying the PIFS on the original image repeatedly while using a value for the contrast parameter that is lower than the predefined one. Quantitative and qualitative results stress the superior performance of the proposed contrast enhancement algorithm against four other widely used contrast enhancement methods; namely, linear and nonlinear unsharp masking, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram <b>Equalization</b> and Local <b>Range</b> Modification.

40|$|The great {{demand for}} location-aware {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) motivates the research in this thesis. The unique characteristics of WSNs impose numerous challenges on localization and communication. In this thesis, we handle some key challenges and provide affordable solutions. Impulse radio ultra wideband (IR-UWB) is employed as the fundamental technology for both localization and communication due to its distinctive advantages in accurate ranging and reliable communication. The following aspects are treated in this thesis. Transmitted-reference (TR) UWB communication systems: IR-UWB processing in the digital domain usually asks for very high sampling rates. The TR-UWB scheme allows for sub-Nyquist rate sampling by correlating the received pulse sequence with its delayed version in the analog domain. Thus, it avoids the daunting Nyquist sampling rate, relaxes the stringent synchronization requirements, and only asks for aggregate channel coefficients. A data model including various kinds of interferences is employed, and then a complete receiver is proposed including signal detection, channel estimation, synchronization and <b>equalization.</b> Theoretical <b>ranging</b> bounds and practical ranging methods based on IR-UWB: We investigate the theoretical ranging accuracy of a novel method, which exploits the range information in both the amplitude and the time delay of the received signal. The investigations are conducted not only for an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel with attenuation, but also for an AWGN channel with both attenuation and shadowing. Furthermore, a practical ranging method based on time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation using UWB IRs is developed. Stroboscopic sampling is employed to sacrifice transmission efficiency for a lower sampling rate. Moreover, it can maintain the same ranging resolution as Nyquist sampling can achieve. Due to the long preamble required by stroboscopic sampling, the clock drift, which is an accumulative effect over time caused by the relative clock skew between different clocks, {{is one of the}} main error sources in TOA estimation. Therefore, TOA estimation methods with clock drift calibration are explored to dramatically mitigate the influence of the drift. Various localization and tracking methods: Extended multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) : Since the classical MDS cannot be applied to general networks with missing links, we extend the classical MDS algorithm to deal with a special kind of network with specific missing links. Our goal is to jointly estimate the positions of all the nodes given partial pairwise distance measurements up to a translation, rotation, and reflection. Reference-free time-based localization: Low-complexity least-squares (LS) estimators based on time-of-arrival (TOA) or time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements have been developed in literature to locate a target node with the help of anchors (nodes with known positions). They require to select a reference anchor in order to cancel nuisance parameters or relax stringent synchronization requirements, and suffer from a poor reference selection. We propose reference-free localization estimators based on TOA measurements to decouple the reference dependency. Furthermore, we generalize existing reference-based closed-form localization estimators using TOA or TDOA measurements, and shed new light on their relations to clarify some confusions that still persist in recent literature. Robust time-based localization: Time-based localization approaches attract a lot of interest due to their high accuracy and potentially low cost for WSNs. However, time-based localization is tightly coupled with clock synchronization. Thus, the reliability of timestamps in time-based localization becomes an important yet challenging task to deal with. Regardless of the reliability of the timestamps from the target node, we propose a novel ranging protocol, namely asymmetric trip ranging (ATR), which leads to localization methods that are naturally immune to internal attacks mounted by a compromised target node. Robust localization strategies using the ATR protocol based on TOA measurements are proposed to localize a target node with the help of anchors for asynchronous networks. Kalman tracking: Due to the nonlinearity of the localization problem, a Kalman filter (KF) is usually replaced by an extended KF (EKF) for tracking a mobile target. However, the modeling errors inherently contained in the EKF degrade the tracking performance. Therefore, we make use of the ATR protocol again, carry out exact linearizations, and achieve a KF based on a linear measurement model to track a mobile target with the aid of fixed anchors.

40|$|This thesis aims at {{studying}} the recent dune dynamics {{and the interaction}} between the aeolian and fluvial processes at different temporal and spatial scales. The South-Rayan Dune-Field (SRDF) in Central Egypt was selected as the main study area for this research because it provides a typical example for analyzing dune dynamics and aeolian-fluvial interaction. At a first step a multi-temporal analysis of Landsat-TM 5 images was performed to detect the migration of desert dunes in the SRDF over the time period 1984 - 2003. The near-infrared (NIR) spectral bands of the old and new Landsat-TM 5 images were combined in a bi-temporal layerstack (BTLS), from which the dune migration and the overall sand drift over the entire dune-field can be detected. The BTLS was then used as an input to RGB-clustering (RGBC), which was performed to convert the color display of the BTLS into a map of dune activity between 1984 and 2003. In order to check the applicability and limitations of the technique it was also tested in other four dune systems around the globe. The technique proposed here was very successful in providing an initial insight into the dune dynamics in the dune-field without prior knowledge or field measurements. This makes it also highly applicable for investigation of inaccessible dune systems (i. e. extended sand seas and extraterrestrial dune systems). Moreover, the maps produced by the RGBC serve as digital bi-temporal atlases of large dune areas, from which smaller areas for detailed dune studies can be defined. For more quantitative analysis of dune migration in the SRDF another approach was followed. The same pair of Landsat-TM 5 images, used in performing the RGBC, was the main source of information to carry out the quantitative analysis. Here, all the spectral channels of the Landsat-TM 5 images, excluding the thermal band, were used. Image enhancement techniques - i. e. histogram <b>equalization</b> and dynamic <b>range</b> adjustment - were implemented to increase the contrast between the dunes and other land objects in the study area. This enabled a semi automatic extraction of dune boundaries in 1984 and 2003. The migration rate in m a- 1 of 43 dunes was estimated based on the calculation of the movement of centroids(i. e. centroid displacement) corresponding to each dune. At the end, a dune-migration map showing the direction and the magnitude of dune migration was produced. The results show that the barchan dunes in the SRDF are migrating NNW-SSE with a mean migration rate of 4. 4 m a- 1. Moreover, the dunemigration was found to be mainly controlled by dune size and the interdune slope-aspect. The migrating dunes of the SRDF are invading the contemporary Nile floodplain at several locations. The sand encroachment at these locations pose a permanent threat to soil productivity, agricultural production and thus sustainability of the local communities. Landsat-TM 5 images were classified to produce land use/land cover maps of the study area for quantifying the changes resulting from sand encroachment into the Nile floodplain. Furthermore, old maps and a CORONA image, dating from 1947 and 1968 respectively, were used along with the RGBC maps to perform a visual change detection analysis over the time period 1947 - 2011. The results show that indeed the sand encroachment is causing a land degradation rate equal to 32 ha a- 1. However, {{it was found that the}} dunes were being removed at much higher rates (i. e. 233 ha a- 1) by quarrying activities, leveling, irrigation and the establishment of agriculture over the last six decades. Hence, at larger spatial scale the human impact on dunes is much more pronounced than the perceived sand encroachment hazard. The results obtained on the recent dune dynamics and the anthropogenic interaction with dune migration have stimulated the extension of the research over longer time scales, i. e. the Holocene. This has been done through a geomorphologic approach based onthe analysis of sediment stratigraphy at the aeolian-fluvial interface. Electric resistivity ground imaging (ERGI) was combined with sediment coring to map the shallow deposits in the area. Furthermore, sediment characteristics were assessed using geochemical analysis, texture analysis and microscopic surface texture of the sand grains. Moreover, the age of some samples from the corings and quarry faces have been estimated by radiocarbon and OSL dating. The analysis of the sediment stratigraphy indicates several cycles of aeolian versus fluvial dominance in the area during the Holocene. Furthermore, a simple landscape evolution model is proposed for the study area. Based on thismodel, three main stratigraphic units could be distinguished: the Late-Pleistocene Nile braided floodplain or an old dune system, the aggrading Early Holocene Nile silts and the drying phase of the Late Holocene with dune expansion from the Western Desert into the Nile floodplain with a migration rate of 2 - 3. 2 m a- 1. The coring results indicate that human occupation of the dune areas was a common practice since Pharaonic times. Finally, the results produced in different parts of this thesis were integrated to understand the evolution of the SRDF and its interaction with the Nile fluvial system from the Mid-Holocene until present. It can be concluded that the Nile floodplain was first invaded by migrating dunes around 6000 BP and the dunesstart to accumulate within the floodplain around 4500 BP. However, several flooding events took place and they invaded the interdune areas and reworked the dune sediments during the Late Holocene. The sand flux in the SRDF indicates that on average 0. 34 Mt of sand is drifted into the Nile floodplain every year. This sand flux is considered relatively low compared to the sediment transport capacity of the River Nile (2. 8 Mt a- 1). On the other side, Bahr Youssef was found less competitive (i. e. 0. 25 MT a- 1). Moreover, if the sand in the interdune areas is taken into account the total sand flux from the SRDF into the floodplain is four times higher (1 - 1. 3 Mt a- 1). This could point to the fact that Bahr Youssef was forced to shift its courseeastward due to the expansion of the dune system during the Late Holocene. The overall setting is therefore suggesting a long history of mutual aeolian-fluvial-human interaction in the study area. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"
