40|$|One of {{the major}} {{problems}} {{in the analysis of}} beams with Moment of Inertia varying along their length, is to find the <b>Fixed</b> <b>End</b> <b>Moments,</b> Stiffness, and Carry-Over Factors. In order to determine <b>Fixed</b> <b>End</b> <b>Moments,</b> it is necessary to consider the non-prismatic member as integrated by a large number of small sections with constant Moment of Inertia, and to find the M/EI values for each individual section. This process {{takes a lot of time}} from Designers and Structural Engineers. The object of this thesis is to design a computer program to simplify this repetitive process, obtaining rapidly and effectively the Final Moments and Shears in continuous non-prismatic Beams. For this purpose the Column Analogy and the Moment Distribution Methods of Professor Hardy Cross have been utilized as the principles toward the methodical computer solutions. The program has been specifically designed to analyze continuous beams of a maximum of four spans of any length, integrated by symmetrical members with rectangular cross sections and with rectilinear variation of the Moment of Inertia. Any load or combination of uniform and concentrated loads must be considered. Finally sample problems will be solved with the new Computer Program and with traditional systems, to determine the accuracy and applicability of the Program...|$|R

40|$|This {{method is}} a kind of moment {{distribution}} methods. In an analysis of a non-rectangular rigid frame by the ordinary method of moment distribution, there must be needed to provide temporary support reactions and enforcing displacement forces. But in this method, none of these forces are needed. This method involves two main processes which are called “distribution　process” and “allotment　process” respectively, the former is utilized in ordinary method of moment distriblltion which satisfies the moment equations at joints, While the latter is a new concept which satisfies shear equations of the slope-deflection method. The “allotment process” is the process enforcing a kind of deformation of frames in which only one independent member rotation angle occures, while the others are kept zero and every joint rotation is <b>fixed.</b> <b>End</b> <b>moments</b> in this process necessarily satisfy corresponding shear equation of the slope deflection method. These <b>end</b> <b>moments</b> can be calculated from the storey moments muliplied by “allotments coefficients. ” The storey moments is the minus-signed work done by the loads applied on the frames in the shear eruation, which is virtual work equation of load-and-end-moment system of the frame when only one independent member rotation angle can occure and its value is unit quantity but the others are zero. The “allotment　coefficient” is the ratio of the allotment moment(end moment) to the storey moment when only one independent member rotation occure and the others and all joint rotation are kept zero. A member of the rigid frame can have several alltoment coefficients each of of which oorresponds each independent member rotation angle. This method consists in altertive application of distribution process and allotment process. Then moment equations and shear equations in the slope deflection method are iteraly and one by one satisfied approximately. So after several applications, we can get exact solution...|$|R
