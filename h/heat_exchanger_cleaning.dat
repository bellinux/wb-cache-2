40|$|Oil {{refinery}} is one {{of industries}} that require huge energy consumption. The today technology advance requires energy saving. Heat integration is a method used to minimize the energy comsumption though the implementation of Heat Exchanger Network (HEN). CPT {{is one of}} types of Heat Exchanger Network (HEN) that functions to recover the heat {{in the flow of}} product or waste. HEN comprises a number of heat exchangers (HEs) that are serially connected. However, the presence of fouling in the heat exchanger has caused the decline of the performance of both heat exchangers and all heat exchanger networks. Fouling can not be avoided. However, it can be mitigated. In industry, periodic <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> <b>cleaning</b> is the most effective and widely used mitigation technique. On the other side, a very frequent cleaning of heat exchanger can be much costly in maintenance and lost of production. In this way, an accurate optimization technique of cleaning schedule interval of heat exchanger is very essential. Commonly, this technique involves three elements: model to simulate the heat exchanger network, representative fouling model to describe the fouling behavior and suitable optimization algorithm {{to solve the problem of}} clening schedule interval for heat exchanger network. This paper describe the optimization of interval cleaning schedule of HEN within the 44 -month period using PSO (particle swarm optimization). The number of iteration used to achieve the convergent is 100 iterations and the fitness value in PSO correlated with the amount of heat recovery, cleaning cost, and additional pumping cost.

40|$|Process fouling and the {{penalties}} {{associated with it}} in petroleum refinery, particularly in the crude preheat train, {{have been the subject}} of extensive research over the last 30 years. Periodic cleaning and temperature drop due to the fouling have resulted in productivity losses and increased energy consumption. A common approach to reduce cleaning downtime is the injection of effective antifoulants into crude oil stream. However, with the wide variation in crude oil composition and fouling mechanisms, the use of antifoulant alone can often be ineffective. Together with the use of antifoulant, a systemsâ€™ design approach was proposed in this study to remove process bottlenecks due to <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> fouling in a petroleum refinery preheat train. The method calls for retrofit by over-designing the fouled exchangers.

The present study involves the sizing of triple concentric pipes <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> where in two cold water streams flow through the central tube and outer annular space at same mass flow rates and same inlet temperatures in co-current direction while hot water flows through inner annular space in counter-current direction.

40|$|One of {{the major}} indeterminates in the design as well as {{operation}} of <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> is the rate of fouling a select <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> geometry would exhibit over the operation cycles. Gradual deterioration of <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> performance due to the accumulation of fouling film on the heat transfer surface is often accounted for {{in the form of}} a fouling resistance, or commonly known as the fouling factor, while determining the heat transfer surface required for a specific heat duty.
