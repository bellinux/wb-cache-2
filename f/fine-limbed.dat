60|$|The Haji repaid {{me for my}} docility by vaunting me {{everywhere}} as {{the very}} phoenix of physicians. My first successes were in the Wakalah; opposite to me there lived an Arab slave dealer, whose Abyssinians constantly fell sick. A tender race, they suffer when first transported to Egypt from many complaints, especially consumption, dysentery and varicose veins. I succeeded in curing one girl. As she was worth at least fifteen pounds, the gratitude of her owner was great, and I had to dose half a dozen others in order to cure them of the pernicious and price-lowering habit of snoring. Living in rooms opposite these slave girls, and seeing them {{at all hours of}} the day and night, I had frequent opportunities of studying them. They were average specimens of the steato-pygous Abyssinian breed, broad-shouldered, thin-flanked, <b>fine-limbed,</b> and with haunches of a prodigious size. None of them had handsome features, but the short curly hair that stands on end being concealed under a kerchief, there was something pretty in the brow, eyes, and upper part of the nose, coarse and sensual in the pendent lips, large jowl and projecting mouth, whilst the whole had a combination of piquancy with sweetness. Their style of flirtation was peculiar.|$|E
6000|$|Queeker and {{his friend}} were first in the field, but {{they had not been}} there many minutes when one and another and another red-coat came cantering over the country, and ere long a large cavalcade {{assembled}} in front of a mansion, the lawn of which formed the rendezvous. There were men of all sorts and sizes, on steeds of all kinds and shapes--little men on big horses, and big men on little horses; men who looked like [...] "bloated aristocrats" [...] before the bloating process had begun, and men in whom the bloating process was pretty far advanced, but who had no touch of aristocracy to soften it. Men who looked healthy and happy, others who looked reckless and depraved. Some wore red-coats, cords, and tops--others, to the surprise and no small comfort of Queeker, who fancied that all huntsmen wore red coats, were habited in modest tweeds of brown and grey. Many of the horses were sleek, glossy, and <b>fine-limbed,</b> like racers; others were strong-boned and rough. Some few were of gigantic size and rugged aspect, to suit the massive men who bestrode them. One of these in particular, a hearty, jovial farmer--and a relative of Tom's--appeared to the admiring Queeker to be big and powerful enough to have charged a whole troop of light dragoons single-handed with some hope of a successful issue. Ladies were there to witness the start, and two of the fair sex appeared ready to join the hunt and follow the hounds, while here and there little boys might be seen bent on trying their metal on the backs of Shetland ponies.|$|E
5000|$|The Tarporley Painter was a Greek Apulian red-figure vase painter. His works date to {{the first}} quarter of the 4th century BC. The Tarporley Painter is his period's most {{important}} representative of the so-called [...] "Plain Style". He is considered to have been the pupil and successor of the Sisyphus Painter, as indicated by his elegant <b>fine-limbed</b> figures and the solemn facial expressions of his woman and cloaked youths. He painted garments in a less balanced style then the Sisyphus Painter. His heads are often oval and lean forwards. The spaces between his figures are often filled with flowers, branches or vines. Over time, his drawing style becomes more fluid, but also less precise. He painted especially on bell kraters, on which he often depicted dionysiac themes and theatrical scenes. His work includes the first known phlyax vase, showing the punishment of a thief, accompanied by a metric verse inscription. Mythological scenes by him are rare. There appears to be an especially close relationship between the work of the Tarporley Painter and that of the Dolon Painter, perhaps they cooperated directly for some time. His succession is represented by three separate schools, each clearly influenced by him. The most important painter of the first is the Schiller Painter, of the second the Hoppin Painter and of the third the Painter of Karlsruhe B9 and the Dijon Painter.|$|E
5000|$|Ismene Brown, in The Daily Telegraph {{reviewed}} her 2005 {{performance as}} Giselle at Sadler's Wells: [...] "Valdes is glorious, {{one of the}} great ballerinas of our time, and a very fine Giselle. Very <b>fine-limbed,</b> with eloquent eyes and a dimpled smile, she packs the kind of technique that not only redefines the spectacular but can hide its strength inside sincerest emotion or misty illusions. And her Giselle was so naturally assumed, so light in touch, and yet so deep in impact, an eager, happy girl, driven by the torrent of emotions, loving life, and unfamiliar with deception, her disintegration into death piteous to watch..." [...] In a separate article about the same tour, Brown wrote: [...] "Having lost two major talents - Rolando Sarabia, who reportedly defected to the US last week, and ballerina Alihaydée Carreño - the Ballet Nacional de Cuba relies heavily on its two remaining first-class talents, the stupendously entertaining party-girl Viengsay Valdés and her gentlemanly partner Joel Carreño (yes, another Carreño). Their Don Quixote excerpt in the second half defied belief. The beautiful Valdés takes the celebrated Cuban balancing and turning ability to the highest degree. When she spins, Carreño whips her like a top into a smiling blur. When she strikes an arabesque, arms flamboyantly high, leg at a perfect 90 degrees, head thrown laughingly back, she simply hangs there while time studies its fingernails. In Havana, watchers applaud ecstatically; in London, there was the dead silence of mass incredulity." ...|$|E
