40|$|Tryptamine, aryl aldehyde, and benzyl {{chloride}} undergo smooth coupling using well-ordered mesoporous AlSBA- 15 catalyst with hexagonal {{porous structure}} in acetonitrile at 80 °C to furnish tetrahydrocarbolines in good yields {{with a high}} selectivity. This reaction also proceeds with <b>homoveratrylamine</b> to give the corresponding tetrahydroisoquinolines. A variety of aryl and heteroaryl aldehydes have also been used for producing tetrahydrocarbolines in high yields. This AlSBA- 15 -promoted Pictet–Spengler reaction provides a mild alternative to the traditional Brönsted or Lewis acids typically employed for the preparation of tetrahydrocarbolines and tetrahydroisoquinolines...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAminopentadienals {{resulting}} from the condensation of tryptamine or <b>homoveratrylamine</b> with glutaconaldehydes were treated with trifluoroacetic anhydride, allowing the formation of tetrahydro-beta-carbolines and tetrahydroisoquinolines bearing an enal function. In this N-acyl Pictet-Spengler reaction the electrophilicity of the aminopentadienals was dramatically increased by O,N-bistrifluoroacetylation. Recovery of the nitrogen nucleophilicity was achieved using a reductive process, and the heterocyclic amines were converted into aminonitriles by a Strecker reaction {{in the presence of}} butanal. Cyclization, by intramolecular Michael addition of the in situ generated enamines onto the enal moiety, was achieved in the presence of zinc triflate and involved cyanide ion trapping. In this manner, compounds related to protoemetine and dihydrocorynantheal were obtained, and a reduction step led to a short synthesis of (+/-) -protoemetinol...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{synthesis}} of four {{new series of}} acyclic heteroaromatic receptors is described. They are built by two flexible polyether chains 	 functionalised at their end with pyridazinone or methylpyridazine rings and connected by pyridine or benzene units. Their ability as carriers 	 of lipophilic and hydrophilic phenethylamines and metallic cations has been evaluated. Transport rates show that, in general, these compounds are much more efficient carriers of lipophilic amines than of dopamine and NaC,KC and Ca 2 C ions. Their transport selectivities 	 towards phenethylamine and <b>homoveratrylamine</b> are discussed {{on the basis of}} their structural features. Molecular modelling studies suggest 	 that interaction of the aromatic moiety of the guest with the pyridazinone rings via double p-stacking, or with the pyridine ring by single 	 p-stacking, should be responsible of their enhanced efficacy and selectivity in the transport of lipophilic phenethylamines. ﻿The authors thank the Spanish Comision Interministerial de 	 Ciencia y Tecnologı´ a for financial support given to this 	 research work (SAF 99 - 0063).

40|$|A novel isocratic reverse phase high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (RPâHPLC) with photo diode array (PDA) detection method for {{the determination of}} dobutamine (DBT) in rat plasma was developed and validated after optimization of various chromatographic conditions and other experimental parameters. <b>Homoveratrylamine</b> {{was used as an}} internal standard. Methanol was used as the extracting solvent for the preparation of plasma samples. Samples were separated on a Symmetry C 18 (250 Â mmÃ 4. 6 Â mm i. d., 5 Â Î¼m) analytical column. Acetonitrile and 15 Â mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate (pH 5. 0 with 0. 3 % TEA) (20 : 80, v/v) was used. The column oven temperature was optimized at 35 Â Â°C and the flow rate was 0. 8 Â mL/min. The detection wavelength was fixed at 230 Â nm for entire analysis. The calibration curve was found to be linear over the concentration range of 50 â 2000 Â ng/mL (r 2 = 0. 9992). The limit of quantification (LOQ) of the method was 50 Â ng/mL. The % RSD values of accuracy and precision values for intra and inter days were < 15 % at quality control (QC) concentrations. Recovery, stability and robustness were studied within the acceptable range according to ICH guidelines. The method was efficiently applied to a pharmacokinetic study in healthy Wistar rats.
