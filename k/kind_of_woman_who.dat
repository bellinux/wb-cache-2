[...] Roth supported her, claiming that [...] "Jonny hasn't discovered girls yet but when he does Jessie would be the type of girl he'd like to be with... I think something will happen between them but right now Jess is his best friend." [...] H-B Chief Fred Seibert agreed, hinting that as adults [...] "there might be a Tracy/Hepburn thing going on."

2500|$|Negative reviews {{came from}} Xan Brooks of The Guardian, {{who gave the}} film one star, {{describing}} it as [...] "a primped and simpering folly, the turkey that dreamed it was a peacock. Brooks predicted that the film [...] "may even surpass 2008's Filth and Wisdom, Madonna's calamitous first outing as a film-maker. Her direction is so all over the shop that it barely qualifies as direction at all." [...] Pointing out a scene, he added that [...] "Madonna has Wallis bound on stage to dance with a Masai tribesman while Pretty Vacant blares on the soundtrack. But why? What point is she making? That social-climbing Wallis-Simpson was the world's first punk-rocker?" [...] Todd McCarthy from The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film resembled a documentary of a woman out on a shopping expedition. McCarthy felt that the storyline was especially dreary during the portrayal of the love affair between Wally and Evgeni. [...] "For the audience, Wally, despite Cornish's gentle and warm presence, offers very little in terms of personal interest or as a key {{into the world of}} one of the last century's most discussed couples." [...] However, McCarthy praised cinematographer Hagen Bogdaski's work. Oliver Lyttelton of indieWire also slammed the film stating that [...] "the use of music is horrible" [...] and [...] "We’ve never looked forward to Madonna going back on tour more, if only because it means that we’ll know, for certain, that she won’t be using that time to direct another movie." [...] Emma Pritchard from Grazia added that [...] "Wallis Simpson was the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> was accused of being more style than substance– and that, alas, is what Madonna has recreated on screen with W.E." [...] Mark Adams of Screen Daily singled out Riseborough's performance as a [...] "highlight", but overall felt that the film was disappointing. Leslie Felperin from Variety was disappointed in the film, saying that it is [...] "burdened with risible dialogue and weak performances". Felperin felt that the reason for the film's downfall was its script, which attended to the costumes and fashion more than the actual story, which she felt had much potential, but was unused.|$|E

40|$|A recent {{series of}} court cases in Australia in which {{teachers}} {{have been convicted of}} sexual crimes against children and adolescents has brought to attention the fact that females are capable of, and do commit, such crimes. However, the nature of the crimes does not reflect the range of sexually abusive behaviours females may perpetrate, nor the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> may engage in such behaviour. We consider definitional problems in identifying female-perpetrated sexual abuse, and note that apart from one attempt to describe the range of sexual abuse perpetrated by mothers, there is little to guide researchers or clinicians in relation to female perpetrated offences more generally. We then consider approaches to categorising female sex offenders, and conclude that, although there a several such approaches that overlap in some ways, a multidimensional approach that combines aspects of each taxonomy may be more useful. <br /...|$|R

Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her to church. She was a plain, motherly <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman,</b> <b>who</b> had worked hard in her youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his particular claim on her to leave her neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his fireside.|$|E

With original roster mostly intact in these seasons, the Belles clinched the title in 1946. Racine won first place with a league-best 74-38 record, captured the semifinal round by beating South Bend in four games, and took the lead in the finals over the 1945 champion Rockford, four games to two. Racine's Winter collected four wins in all series, including three against Rockford, despite allowing 19 base runners in a 14-inning, 1-0 shutout victory in decisive Game Six. The only run in the marathonic game came {{in the bottom of the}} 14th, when Kurys hit a single off Mildred Deegan, then stole second base, and scored on an RBI-single by Betty Trezza. Unfortunately for Deegan, she was the pitching star of the over-all series, beating Grand Rapids and Racine twice each and winning four straight before the Belles finally stopped her in the final game. Meanwhile, Hickson exemplified the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> played hardball in the league, heroically catching throughout the ten playoffs games with a broken finger on her throwing hand.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} women’s use {{of public}} parks in Edwardian Manchester. It addresses both leisure and non-leisure activities. Like many cities at this time, Manchester City Council was investing in municipal public parks, {{the high point of}} which was the purchase of the 650 acre Heaton Park in 1902. 	Evidence demonstrates that <b>women</b> were some <b>of</b> the earliest users of the new park – both as leisure visitors with or without children, but also as political activists such as suffragettes and members of the temperance movement. The availability of large, open spaces resulted in a reconfiguring of the lives <b>of</b> Edwardian <b>women.</b> The restrictive atmosphere of many Victorian parks with their improving and didactic agendas had begun to ease in the Edwardian period; consequently, the opportunities for women to become active (in the leisure and non-leisure sense) in parks increased also. 	While the development of sporting amenities such as golf and tennis in public parks often reinforced gender segregation, parks also offered an opportunity for the private female and the public male worlds to interact. Contemporary photographs enable us to speculate about the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> visited public parks and for what purpose. The flowering of the municipal public park in Manchester in the Edwardian era complemented the gradual increase in the opportunities for women to liberate themselves from the domestic sphere and to develop new roles as users of social spaces...|$|R
6000|$|As to the Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, rugged man, {{whose very}} face {{is the color}} of gunpowder, he also knows French, and can even write in it, if he like,--having duly had a Tutor of that nation, and strange adventures with him on the grand tour and elsewhere;--but does not much {{practise}} writing, when it can be helped. His children, I have heard, he expressly did not teach to read or write, seeing no benefit in that effeminate art, but left them to pick it up as they could.

60|$|Audrey Noel, too, {{had been}} early astir, {{though she had}} gone late enough to bed.

When she had finished, she looked at herself in the glass rather more distrustfully than usual. She felt that her sort of woman was at a {{discount}} in these days, and being sensitive, she was never content either with her appearance, or her habits. But, for all that, she went on behaving in unsatisfactory ways, because she incorrigibly loved to look as charming as she could; and even if no one were going to see her, she never felt that she looked charming enough. She was--as Lady Casterley had shrewdly guessed--the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> spoils men by being too nice to them; of no use to those who wish women to assert themselves; yet having a certain passive stoicism, very disconcerting. With little or no power of initiative, she would do what she was set to do with a thoroughness that would shame an initiator; temperamentally unable to beg anything of anybody, she required love as a plant requires water; she could give herself completely, yet remain oddly incorruptible; in a word, hopeless, and usually beloved of those who thought her so.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to examine the extent to which 10 -year breast cancer survivors integrated cancer into their self-concept (i. e. survivor centrality), identify predictors of survivor centrality, and determine the relation of survivor centrality to well-being. METHODS: Breast cancer survivors (n= 240) were interviewed 10 years following the initial diagnosis. They completed measures of survivor centrality, illness valence (i. e. positive or negative views of illness), and well-being (positive and negative affect, mental and physical functioning, psychological distress, benefit finding). RESULTS: There were few predictors <b>of</b> the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> were more likely to integrate breast cancer into their self-concepts, but survivor centrality was related to engaging in behaviors that suggested survivorship was relevant to women 2 ̆ 7 s daily lives, such as becoming involved in breast cancer activities. Survivor centrality was related to three markers of negative psychological well-being: more negative affect, poorer mental functioning, and greater psychological distress. However, in the case of negative affect and psychological distress, this relation was moderated by illness valence, such that survivor centrality was only related to negative psychological well-being when the illness was viewed in less positive terms. CONCLUSIONS: Women vary in {{the extent to which they}} define themselves in terms of the breast cancer experience. Survivor centrality in and of itself is not always indicative of adjustment to disease. When women have a more negative view of being a breast cancer survivor, survivor centrality is more likely to signify potential problems...|$|R

40|$|This {{project is}} a {{comparative}} study <b>of</b> print about <b>women</b> accused <b>of</b> murder in eighteenth-century London and Paris. While gender {{played an important role}} in determining how such women were perceived, in that female killers stimulated forms of social introspection that male murderers did not, this thesis demonstrates that a wider variety of factors affected the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>women</b> <b>who</b> stimulated concern among the London and Parisian populace. Most importantly, only eleven <b>women</b> accused <b>of</b> murder stimulated high levels of print reaction in the period, implying that aspects beyond their gender were behind such reactions. Through focus on the print material and judicial records of these eleven high-profile murderesses, including ballads, pamphlets, images, novels, legal tracts and printed correspondence, this thesis will expose a number of contemporary concerns present in eighteenth-century London and Paris. In both cities, perceptions of the crime of female-perpetrated murder reflected emerging concerns about the impact of urbanisation on social structures and women’s roles, alongside shifting European-wide ideas of gender difference. Murderous women’s occupations as midwives, servants, aristocrats and household managers were used to explore broader concerns about emerging sites of female independence. Discussion of cases that involved adultery, male sociability and court intrigue were used to reveal the perceived corrupting effects of urban society. But there were noticeable differences in the ways that such women were perceived in London and Paris. Heavy censorship in Paris imbued print on high-profile murderesses with politicised messages of transgression, whereas in London a freer press saw such cases as symbolic of the tensions brought by urban growth to relations between the middle and lower classes. ...|$|R
