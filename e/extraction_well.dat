50|$|Dual-phase vacuum {{extraction}} (DPVE), {{also known}} as multi-phase extraction, is a technology that uses a high-vacuum system to remove both contaminated groundwater and soil vapor. In DPVE systems, a high-vacuum <b>extraction</b> <b>well</b> is installed with its screened section in the zone of contaminated soils and groundwater. Fluid/vapor extraction systems depress the water table and water flows faster to the <b>extraction</b> <b>well.</b> DPVE removes contaminants from {{above and below the}} water table. As the water table around the well is lowered from pumping, unsaturated soil is exposed. This area, called the capillary fringe, is often highly contaminated, as it holds undissolved chemicals, chemicals that are lighter than water, and vapors that have escaped from the dissolved groundwater below. Contaminants in the newly exposed zone can be removed by vapor extraction. Once above ground, the extracted vapors and liquid-phase organics and groundwater are separated and treated. Use of dual-phase vacuum extraction with these technologies can shorten the cleanup time at a site, because the capillary fringe is often the most contaminated area.|$|E

By heating up the soil and vaporizing the contaminated liquid, it is anticipated that rate of extraction will increase as long as the recondensation is not significant. A major concern, therefore, is whether recondensation will occur. Intuitively, one might speculate that liquid phase may dominate near the injection well. Moving away from the injection site towards the <b>extraction</b> <b>well,</b> due to the combined effects of lower pressure and higher temperature (from heating), phase change occurs and a mixture of vapour and liquid may co-exist. There may also be a vapour-only region, depending on the values of temperature, pressure, and other parameters. In the two-phase zone, since vapour bubbles tend to rise due to the buoyancy force, and the temperature decreases along the vertical path of the bubbles out of the heated region, {{it is possible that the}} bubbles will recondense before reaching the <b>extraction</b> <b>well.</b> As a consequence, the probability exists that part of the contaminants stay in the soil. Obviously, to predict transition between single-phase and two-phase regions and to understand the transport phenomenon in detail, a thermal capillary two-phase flow model is needed.
