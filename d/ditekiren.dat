40|$|AbstractThe hepatic {{elimination}} of many oligopeptides is both rapid and extensive, and often limits their potential as therapeutic agents. The linear, hydrophobic pseudo-hexapeptide <b>ditekiren,</b> a renin inhibitor, {{is one such}} example. The mechanism(s) involved in its hepatic clearance are largely unknown; accordingly, the characteristics of ditekiren's transport into isolated rat hepatocytes was investigated. In addition to a concentration-independent, linear process, uptake also involved a carrier-mediated component (Km= 0. 2 ± 0. 05 μM; Vmax= 11. 6 ± 0. 6 pmol (mg protein) − 1 min− 1). Phenobarbital pretreatment in vivo resulted in marked induction of such transport. Negative results from cis-inhibition studies with substrates and/or inhibitors of well-established hepatic transport systems, e. g., sodium-dependent bile acid, sodium-independent multispecific bile acid and cation carriers, ruled out their involvement in ditekiren's uptake. By contrast, a number of cyclic and linear oligopeptides inhibited the uptake process to varying extents {{and in the case}} of EMD- 59121, the most inhibitory compound, the interaction was competitive in nature. Collectively, these data suggest the presence of a novel high affinity, low capacity transporter in rat hepatocytes with specific affinity for <b>ditekiren</b> and possibly other oligopeptides...|$|E
40|$|Many small oligopeptides {{are rapidly}} {{excreted}} unchanged into bile, which requires vectorial transport across the hepatocyte. To characterize the involved carrier system(s) at the canalicular membrane, studies were undertaken with vesicle preparations from the rat {{and the model}} pseudohexapeptide <b>ditekiren.</b> The initial uptake rate into inside-out-oriented vesicles {{was found to be}} ATP- and temperature-dependent and saturable. Kinetic analysis indicated the involvement of three processes: (1) an ATP-dependent carrier-mediated process (Km 5 19. 1 6 4. 26 mM; mean 6 S. E. M.), Vmax 5 140 6 29. 4 pmol/mg of protein/ 15 sec), (2) an ATP-independent carrier-mediated transporter (Km 5 17. 2 6 9. 58 mM, Vmax 5 62. 9 6 24. 5 pmol/mg of protein/ 15 sec) and (3) a nonsaturable component. ATP-dependent uptake was inhibited by several other oligopeptides, which in the cas...|$|E
40|$|Oligopeptides {{developed}} as potential therapeutic agents are often Ilmfted in their duration of action because of rapid disappearance from the bloodstream, {{even if they}} are proteolytically stable. In a number of instances, this involves hepatic elimination via biliary excretion of intact peptide. Knowledge of the processes of such hepatic uptake and secretion and their characteristics is Iimfted. Accordingly, the disposition of the renin inhibitor ditekiren-a pseu-dohexapeptide used as a model agent-was investigated in the isolated perfused rat liver preparation. Disappearance of radioactiv-fty from the perfusate after the rapid addition of a radiolabeled tracer dose (0. 1 1 gig) of <b>ditekiren</b> was biexponential. The concomitant administration of increasing doses of unlabeled OIigOPePtIde (0. 25 to 5 mg) had no effect on the perfusate’s pharmacokinetic parame-ters, including clearance, 6. 82 ± 0. 88 mI/mm (mean ± SD) at a perfusate flow rate of 10 mI/mm. However, at the 10 mg dosag...|$|E
