Blue Sky won Hub Atlanta's $ 3, 500 service {{package for}} Most Ready for Market. The team {{is working on}} affordable, {{effective}} air <b>filtration</b> <b>masks</b> for use in developing countries with heavy pollution, such as China. The team, which aims to add fashion flair to protective face masks, includes 2012 Executive MBA in Global Business graduates Clint Olearnick, Drew Mathias, and Clifton Peay.

5000|$|Although {{the concept}} of air <b>filtration</b> <b>masks</b> dates {{back as far as}} Pliny the Elder, many early designs {{suffered}} from serious flaws, including an inability to adequately filter or provide enough air to the user, or design shortcomings that led to equipment that was either uncomfortable or difficult to don and use.|$|R
50|$|The Airzone Solution {{takes place}} in a future Britain where {{pollution}} has reached a point where the populace must often wear <b>filtration</b> <b>masks</b> when they venture outside. AirZone, a powerful corporation, signs a lucrative deal with the government to deal with the problem. The public is told that AirZone plans to build giant filtration plants to clean the atmosphere, but environmentalists are skeptical, especially when people begin dying and disappearing around AirZone facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{characteristics}} of the wall flow diesel Particulate filter substrate are as follows: broad band filtration (the diameters of the filtered particles are 0.2-150 μm); <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency (can be up to 95%); high refractory; high mechanical properties.high boiling point.|$|R
40|$|Nanofibers {{have a large}} {{potential}} in air filtration applications, so this paper explores the performance of electrospun nanofiber membrane compared to traditional filtration fabrics. Poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO) and Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) were electrospun into nanofibrous membranes and analyzed their filtration attributes. Experimentation revealed that nanofibrous membranes have <b>higher</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency than traditional filtration fabrics, such as meltblown and needle filtration material. In addition, Nanofibrous membranes under the same electrospinning process but with different materials had similar <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency, while their permeability had obvious difference. We suggest that different structure in the nanofiber membrane should cause this difference. Our work proves {{that there is a}} large potential for nanofiber membranes to utilize in air filtration area...|$|R
40|$|Solid-liquid {{filtration}} is {{an important}} unit operation used in several applications in the pulp and paper industry. It can be challenging especially for materials that forms filter cakes that {{has a tendency to}} be highly compressible. The formation of a skin, i. e. an initial cake with a considerably <b>higher</b> <b>filtration</b> resistance, can further increase the filtration resistance for these filter cakes. The separation process in these cases requires considerably larger filter areas. This study investigates skin formation during the filtration of micro-crystalline cellulose, examining the effect of the filter medium, filtration pressure and pH. Depending on the choice of filter medium, the average specific filtration resistance was found to vary by more than one order of magnitude. A decrease in the suspension pH from 6. 3 to 2. 9 lowered both the filtration resistance and the differences between the filtration media. Using local pressure profiles, a region of <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> resistance for some of the filter media and pH values was identified close {{to the bottom of the}} filter cell. Characterisation of the media and micro-crystalline cellulose indicated that internal clogging of the filter medium was unlikely. This suggests that the filter cake closest to the filter medium had a considerably <b>higher</b> <b>filtration</b> resistance compared to the cake formed immediately after, i. e. a skin had been formed under certain conditions...|$|R

50|$|The {{flow rate}} {{is defined as}} the ratio of the driving force over the filter resistance. The two {{conventional}} types of depth filter designs: the rapid and slow filters operate with velocities of 5-15 m/h and 0.1-0.2 m/h respectively; whereas pressurised sand filters have design flow rates of 238 L/min14. During operation the filter rate decreases due to increasing filter resistance as particulates get lodged within the media. The rate of filtration affects the rate of clogging with high filter rates causing faster build up. Pilot tests demonstrate that the higher the filter rate the lower the filter area whilst increasing filter rate reduces the time to breakthrough, reduces the time to head loss (increases head loss) and results in shorter runs and lower optimum depths. They also demonstrate that higher filter rates can be achieved by using larger diameter media and increased media depth. <b>High</b> <b>filtration</b> rates depend on media design with the <b>highest</b> <b>filtration</b> rate design in service at 13.5gpm/ft2.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{recognize}} and extract the milk duct in haematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained breast cancer tissues. The paper presents the modified K-means approach to segmentation of the milk duct in HE stained images. Instead of using single pixels we propose to consider the defined region of pixels in the process. Thanks to such modification more accurate extraction of the milk ducts has been achieved. To compare the results in a numerical way the GT images prepared by the medical expert have been subtracted from the corresponding images created by the segmentation methods. The numerical experiments performed for many preparations have confirmed the superiority of such approach. The proposed method has allowed reducing significantly the error of duct segmentation {{in comparison to the}} classical K-means approaches. The results show, that our method is superior to the standard K-means and to the K-means preceded by averaging or Gaussian filtration at different size of <b>filtration</b> <b>mask...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two ceramic {{supports}} (sintered and foam) {{were employed}} for {{the preparation of}} catalytic filters for soot removal at diesel exhausts. Laboratory tests showed that while the foam filter is appropriate for small size and low engine backpressure, the sintered filter is more suitable for achieving <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency. Tests carried out at the exhaust of a diesel engine showed that the catalytic filter can be continuously regenerated at operating conditions typical of diesel exhaust...|$|R
5000|$|This is the {{standard}} drum filter discharge. A scraper blade, which serves to redirect the filter cake into the discharge chute, removes the cake from the filter cloth just before re-entering the vat. Scraper discharge is used if the desired separation requires <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> rate or if heavy solid slurry is used or if the slurry is easy to filter to produce cake formation or if a longer wear resistance is desired for {{the separation of the}} mentioned slurry.45 ...|$|R
40|$|We {{determine}} the BP-module structure, mod <b>higher</b> <b>filtration,</b> {{of the main}} part of the BP-homology of elementary 2 -groups. In doing this, we show, using algebraic topology, that certain Vandermonde-type systems of equations, mod 2, have solutions that are symmetric polynomials. We then show that in analogous situations not covered by our theorem, instead of polynomials, the solution involves infinite series containing many negative exponents. Equivalently, we have similar results regarding whether quotients of Schur polynomials are polynomials mod 2...|$|R
50|$|It {{is often}} {{regarded}} as a difficult plant to cultivate. This is mainly due to several problems: 1) it likes bright light and this encourages algal growth which is difficult to clear from the leaves; 2) newly imported bulbs grow well {{in the first year}} but often fail in the second year, apparently {{due to a lack of}} food in the bulbs (cause still unknown); 3) seeds may be produced but often fail to germinate or thrive. Some enthusiasts recommend strong water movement and <b>high</b> <b>filtration.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The GFR {{on its own}} is {{the most}} common and {{important}} measure of renal function. However, in a condition such as renal artery stenosis, the blood flow to the kidneys is reduced. The filtration must therefore be increased in order to perform the normal tasks of the kidney in balancing fluid and electrolytes in the body. This would be reflected by a <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> fraction, showing that the kidneys have to do more work with the fluid they are receiving. Diuretics such as loops and thiazides decrease the filtration fraction.|$|R
5000|$|It is a {{suitable}} discharge option for cakes that are thin {{and have the}} tendency to stick with one another. Filter cakes on the drum and discharged roll are pressed against one another {{to ensure that the}} thin filter cake is peeled or pulled from the drum. Removal of solids from the discharge roll is done via a knife blade. Roll discharged is used if the desired separation requires <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> rate, if <b>high</b> solid content slurry is used or if the slurry is easy to filter to produce cake formation or if the discharged solid is sticky or mud-like cake.45 ...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid filter {{material}} was obtained via modification of polypropylene (PP) nonwoven with nanosize zinc oxide particles {{of a high}} aspect ratio. Modification was conducted as a three-step process, a variant of hydrothermal method used for synthesis of nano-ZnO, adopted for coating three dimensional polymeric nonwoven filters. The process consisted of plasma treatment of nonwoven to increase its wettability, deposition of ZnO nanoparticles and low temperature hydrothermal growth of ZnO rods. The modified nonwovens were investigated by a high resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM). It {{has been found that}} the obtained hybrid filters offer a <b>higher</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency, in particular for so called most penetrating particle sizes...|$|R

The new process enables a control of porosity and pore size distribution of the filter material with comparatively high ﬂ exibility, {{in addition to the}} cost reduction compared with the normal sintering process. The developed filter indicated sufficient thermal durability and <b>higher</b> <b>filtration</b> efﬁ ciency on the initial stage which can respond to the severe regulation demanded in the future by controlling the pore size on the wall surface and the microstructure in the wall...|$|R
50|$|TFC {{membranes}} {{are commonly}} classified as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Both types are typically {{made out of}} a thin polyamide layer (<200 nm) deposited {{on top of a}} polyethersulfone or polysulfone porous layer (about 50 microns) on top of a non-woven fabric support sheet. The three layer configuration gives the desired properties of high rejection of undesired materials (like salts), <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> rate, and good mechanical strength. The polyamide top layer is responsible for the high rejection and is chosen primarily for its permeability to water and relative impermeability to various dissolved impurities including salt ions and other small, unfilterable molecules.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{non-invasive}} method for studying microvascular filtration in the non-articular tissues of the forearm is described. Rates of filtration under a standard hydrostatic pressure were measured in 20 normal female subjects and 44 female subjects with connective tissue disorders. An increased mean filtration rate {{was found in}} 14 subjects with rheumatoid arthritis. In 20 subjects with systemic lupus erythematosus and 10 subjects with scleroderma no such generalised increase in filtration rates was seen, but isolated cases had very <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> rates, suggesting a more heterogeneous physiological disturbance. Increased filtration {{was not associated with}} the presence of oedema. This confirms doubts raised by other workers about the importance of filtration in the genesis of clinical oedema...|$|R
40|$|Marine sponges are {{key players}} in the {{transfer}} of carbon from the pelagic microbial food web into the benthos. Selective uptake of prokaryotic picoplankton (3 ̆c 2 μm) by a demosponge (Callyspongia sp.), and carbon flux through this process, were examined {{for the first time in}} the oligotrophic coastal waters of southwestern Australia, where sponge abundance and biodiversity ranks among the highest in the world. Water sampling and flow rate measurements were conducted over five sampling occasions following the InEx method of Yahel et al. (2005), with heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic Synechococcus cyanobacteria identified and enumerated by flow cytometry.

40|$|ABSTRACTThis study {{evaluated}} {{a multidisciplinary}} strategy {{to decrease the}} rate of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) among adult patients hospitalised in two haematology wards in a single 560 -bed building at the University Hospital of Saint-Etienne. Upgrading of the air filtration system and construction of an air-lock chamber {{at the entrance to}} the unit were completed during 1994. In 1995, specific hygienic measures were introduced during hospital building work, including the use of plastic barriers, watering during demolition work, reduction of pedestrian traffic in construction areas, and the wearing of high-efficiency <b>filtration</b> <b>masks</b> by immunosuppressed patients when outside the protected unit. This strategy was evaluated by a prospective survey of IPA cases between 1993 and 2001, coupled with environmental surveillance. The number and risk-level of hospital renovation projects increased between 1995 and 2001 (p < 0. 01). In parallel, the rate of IPA decreased globally in the haematology unit from 0. 85 % (1. 19 / 1000 patients) in 1993 to 0. 28 % (0. 21 / 1000 patients) in 2001. The incidence of IPA decreased significantly between 1993 – 1996 and 1997 – 2001 (p 0. 02, Mann–Whitney test). These results show that a multidisciplinary approach involving engineers, infection control practitioners, mycologists and clinicians enables IPA rates among patients hospitalised in haematology wards to be significantly decreased...|$|R

40|$|A {{composite}} aerosol {{filter media}} was prepared by depositing nanofibers on the non-woven fabrics substrate using needleless electrospinning technique. The polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers with mean diameters of ca. 100 nm {{were used as}} top layers. The filtration performance was evaluated by measuring the filtration of sodium chloride nanoparticles (75 ± 20 nm) through the filters. It {{was found that the}} filtration efficiency of the composite filter media for nanoparticles was increased along with the thickness of nanofibers mats which was controlled by the collection time during the electrospinning. The multi-layer arrangement for fabrication of the composite filter can achieve <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency (up to 99. 95 %) which was comparable to commercial high efficiency particulate air filters but with higher quality factor and less mass...|$|R
40|$|The {{aircraft}} filters have to {{be designed}} to cater for high reliability and stringent environmental conditions. The performance of filter is decided based on the filter media and its rating. Filter rating is evaluated using multi pass test under constant flow conditions. Generally {{there are two types}} of medias used in development of aircraft hydraulic filters (I) glass fibre me-dia and (II) stainless steel mesh media. Glass fiber media is consided as absolute rated and possess <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency compared to the stainless steel mesh media. Stainless steel mesh media filters are of non disposable in nature and possess nominal filter rating.

40|$|The microalgae Tetraselmis suecica, Nannochloropsis oculata, Chlorella sp., Isochrysis gal- bana, and Dunaliella tertiolecta {{were used}} as food for the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis (L type) raised in {{laboratory}} conditions at 25 ± 1 oC and 25 ‰ salinity. Filtration and ingestion rates of the rotifer were determined to {{study the effects of}} different microalgae densities and feeding times on the feeding behavior of the starved B. plicatilis. The <b>highest</b> <b>filtration</b> (11. 5 x 10 - 4 ml/ind/min) and ingestion (246. 99 x 102 cells/ind/min) rates were obtained with N. oculata.

Feeding time significantly influenced these rates: after 60 min, both rates dropped...|$|R
40|$|Spin-dependent quantum {{transport}} {{properties in}} twisted carbon nanotube and stretched carbon nanotube are calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium green’s function (NEGF) formulation. Twisting and stretching {{have no effect}} on spin transport in CNTs at low bias voltages. However, at high bias voltages the effects are significant. Stretching restricts any spin-up current in antiparallel configuration (APC), which results in higher magneto resistance (MR). Twisting allows spin-up current almost equivalent to the pristine CNT case, resulting in lower MR. <b>High</b> spin <b>filtration</b> is observed in PC and APC for pristine, stretched and twisted structures at all applied voltages. In APC, at low voltages spin filtration in stretched CNT is higher than in pristine and twisted ones, with pristine giving a <b>higher</b> spin <b>filtration</b> than twisted CNT...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{processes}} {{that occur in}} MSW produce odorous gas emissions affecting health {{of the people and}} environment. Bio filters are bioreactors most commonly used for odour management. This study focused on evaluation of mature compost based bio filter {{that can be used in}} biological treatment facilities in Sri Lanka. The first experiment was with one layer of filter media, whereas the second with two layers having a 10 cm gap in between them. One wet and the other dry were maintained at 40 % (w/w) and 20 % (w/w) moisture contents, respectively. The odorous gases were obtained from an Inclined Step Grate (ISG) composting system. Ammonia was the reference gas. When one layer filter was used 90 % of incoming ammonia gas filtered. After modifications due to high moisture content of 40 %, <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> efficiency of 95 % from wet bed and remaining 5 % from dry bed were achieved. The wet bed prevented cracking and air channelling effect. The temperatures between 22 – 270 C and pH 6 to 9 of both filter media and stability of volatile compounds were favourable for microbial growth and survival. Doubled or layered filters with smaller depths and gaps between them would be the best design to achieve <b>higher</b> odour <b>filtration</b> efficiencies...|$|R

40|$|A {{process for}} {{dewaxing}} is described. It includes {{the steps of}} mixing a waxy feedstock near its pour point with an ambient or below ambient temperature solvent essentially free of a selected cosolvent, to form a solvent/feedstock mixture, and subsequently adding the cosolvent to the solvent/feedstock mixture to cause instantaneous precipitation of wax on addition of cosolvent. The amount of wax precipitation {{is controlled by the}} quantity and temperature of the cosolvent added. The cosolvent is essentially completely miscible with the solvent, but immiscible with the oil and wax. For example, alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol), ketones (ketene, acetone), amines, etc. The process of the present invention provides the advantages of lower solvent ratios (higher solvent recovery), <b>higher</b> <b>filtration</b> temperatures, “environmentally compatible” solvents, rapid filtration rates, and debottlenecking of existing dewaxing plants...|$|R
40|$|To prevent {{surgical}} site infection it {{is desirable}} to keep the number of airborne-carrying particles low {{in the operating room}} during surgery susceptible to infections. As the airborne bacteria are mainly derived from the skin flora of the personnel present in the operating room a reduction can be achieved by using surgical clothing systems with <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> efficacy. This study will discuss the performance of single-use clothing systems made of polypropylene in the context of operating room during surgical procedures. A comparison between the single-use clothing system and the commonly used reusable clothing systems mad of mixed material (cotton/polyester) is discussed.

50|$|In 2010, SEBO {{replaced}} the C series vacuum with the D1, D2, D3 and D4 series - the largest cylinder vacuum SEBO has ever produced for {{the domestic market}} and specifically designed for large homes. Designed in collaboration with Achim Heine, Professor of product design {{and member of the}} German Design Council, whose timeless design is famous with Braun's small appliances, this innovative new vacuum emanates form and function, led by SEBO's original design knowledge. For example, the circular front, with its patented airbelt bumper, is ideal for negotiating obstacles, houses an easy to remove filter inside, and allows a large capacity 6 litre disposable <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> dust bag. An extra long 12m cable contributes to an incredible 15.5m cleaning range, twice the cord length that other German brands supply.|$|R
25|$|The {{species is}} not {{particularly}} aggressive, feeding on small planktonic and pelagic crustaceans such as krill, prawns, shrimp, and mysids, as well as small squids and fishes. Geographical variation in diet is common, with fish in Malaysia taking species of polychaete worms as the preferred species. Studies on gill filtering mechanisms has shown the Malabar trevally's anatomy lies between two extremes, one which is a <b>high</b> <b>filtration</b> area characteristic of planktivorous species and the other of very low area which is associated with species which take large prey items. This further suggests the Malabar trevally can filter the small krill type prey, as well as taking larger fishes and squid. Seasonal diet fluctuation in the species has been observed in northern Australia, where a seasonal abundance of squid causes the preferred prey to change from paenid shrimp to these squid.|$|R
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{simulation model}} is developed that calculates {{the evolution of}} particle removal and headloss in a packed bed filter, as functions of the morphology of the colloidal particle deposits in the filter. The expressions derived {{are based on the}} postulate that particles form deposits that grow as mass fractals. The model is calibrated and validated with a set of laboratory data previously obtained. The calibrated value of fractal dimension was found to coincide with measurements obtained in an earlier study using light scattering. The effect of the filtration velocity and particle size on the fractal dimension of the deposits is evaluated. The hypothesis that <b>higher</b> <b>filtration</b> velocities create denser deposits is supported. However, a trend of increasing fractal dimension with decreasing particle size runs counter to theoretical expectations. The model is extended to include the effect of variable conditions in the influent...|$|R
