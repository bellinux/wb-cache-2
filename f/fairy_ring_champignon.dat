50|$|A {{great deal}} of {{folklore}} surrounds <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b> Their names in European languages often allude to supernatural origins; they are known as ronds de sorciers ("sorcerers' rings") in France, and Hexenringe ("witches' rings") in German. In German tradition, <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> were thought to mark the site of witches' dancing on Walpurgis Night, and Dutch superstition claimed that the circles show where the Devil set his milk churn. In Tyrol, folklore attributed <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> to the fiery tails of flying dragons; once a dragon had created such a circle, nothing but toadstools could grow there for seven years. European superstitions routinely warned against entering a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring.</b> French tradition reported that <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> were guarded by giant bug-eyed toads that cursed those who violated the circles. In other parts of Europe, entering a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> {{would result in the}} loss of an eye. <b>Fairy</b> <b>rings</b> are associated with diminutive spirits in the Philippines.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{theories}} {{regarding the}} process involved in creating <b>fairy</b> <b>rings.</b> One {{states that the}} <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> is begun by a spore from the sporocarpus. The underground presence of the fungus can also cause withering or varying colour or growth of the grass above. The second theory, which {{is presented in the}} investigations of Japanese scientists on the Tricholoma matsutake species, shows that <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> could be established by connecting neighbouring oval genets of these mushrooms. If they make an arc or a ring, they continuously grow about the centre of this object.|$|R

50|$|Fairy imagery became {{especially}} {{popular in}} the Victorian era. Thomas Hardy uses a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> {{as a symbol of}} lost love in The Mayor of Casterbridge (1886); the character Michael Henchard passes a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> and remembers that he last saw his wife Susan there when he sold her to a sailor in a drunken rage. Victorian poets who have referred to <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> in their works include Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Eliza Cook, Robert Stephen Hawker, Felicia Hemans, Gerald Massey, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. W. H. Cummings composed the cantata The Fairy Ring, and William Butler Yeats wrote of them in The Land of Heart's Desire (1894).|$|R

Early herbalists and botanists could not explain {{the origins of the}} rings. The Irish and Germans thought for centuries they were caused by leprechauns and witches dancing in circles. In Scotland, if farmers tilled an area containing <b>fairy</b> <b>rings,</b> it was believed that “bizarre days and weary nights will last to his dying day. ” Like the many early myths and superstitions, today’s <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> are considered a curse rather than good fortune...|$|R

5000|$|Many folk beliefs {{generally}} paint <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> {{as dangerous}} places, best avoided. Sikes traces these {{stories of people}} trespassing into forbidden territory and being punished for it to the tale of Psyche and Eros. In it, Psyche is forbidden to view her lover, and when she does so, her palace disappears and she is left alone. Superstition calls fairy circles sacred and warns against violating them lest the interloper (such as a farmer with a plough) anger the fairies and be cursed. In an Irish legend recorded by Wilde, a farmer builds a barn on a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> despite the protests of his neighbours. He is struck senseless one night, and a local [...] "fairy doctor" [...] breaks the curse. The farmer says that he dreamed that he must destroy the barn. Even collecting dew from the grass or flowers of a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> can bring bad luck. Destroying a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> is unlucky and fruitless; superstition says it will just grow back.|$|R
5000|$|Western European, {{including}} English, Scandinavian and Celtic, traditions {{claimed that}} <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> {{are the result}} of elves or fairies dancing. Such ideas dated to at least the mediæval period; The Middle English term elferingewort ("elf-ring"), meaning [...] "a ring of daisies caused by elves' dancing" [...] dates to the 12th century. In his History of the Goths (1628), Olaus Magnus makes this connection, saying that <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> are burned into the ground by the dancing of elves. British folklorist Thomas Keightley noted that in Scandinavia in the early 20th century, beliefs persisted that <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> (elfdans) arose from the dancing of elves. Keightley warned that while entering an elfdans might allow the interloper to see the elves—although this was not guaranteed—it would also put the intruder in thrall to their illusions.The folklores of the British Isles contain a wealth of fairy lore, including the idea from which <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> take their name: the phenomena result from the dancing of fairies. In 19th-century Wales, where the rings are known as cylch y Tylwyth Teg, fairies were almost invariably described as dancing in a group when encountered, and in Scotland and Wales in the late 20th century, stories about <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> were still common; some Welsh even claimed to have joined a fairy dance. Victorian folklorists regarded fairies and witches as related, based in part on the idea that both were believed to dance in circles. These revels are particularly associated with moonlit nights, the rings only becoming visible to mortals the following morning. Local variants add other details. An early 20th-century Irish tradition says that fairies enjoy dancing around the hawthorn tree so that <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> often centre on one. One resident of Balquhidder, Scotland, said that the fairies sit on the mushrooms and use them as dinnertables, and a Welsh woman claimed that fairies used the mushrooms as parasols and umbrellas. Olaus Magnus in Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus wrote that the brightness of the <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> comes not from the dancing of the fairies, who harm it with their feet, but from Puck, who refreshes the grass. A Devon legend says that a black hen and chickens sometimes appear at dusk in a large <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> on the edge of Dartmoor. A Welsh and Manx variant current in the 1960s removes dancing from the picture and claims that <b>fairy</b> <b>rings</b> spring up over an underground fairy village. These associations have become linked to specific sites. For example, [...] "The Pixies' Church" [...] was a rock formation in Dartmoor surrounded by a <b>fairy</b> <b>ring,</b> and a stone circle tops Cader Idris in northern Wales, believed to be a popular spot for fairy dances. Guernsey Fairy Ring is also a popular spot for fairie dancing and known for having evil fairies living there.|$|R

40|$|A broad {{class of}} soil fungi form the annular {{patterns}} known as 'fairy rings' and provide {{one of the}} only means to observe spatio-temporal dynamics of otherwise cryptic fungal growth processes in natural environments. We present observations of novel spiral and rotor patterns produced by <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> fungi and explain these behaviors mathematically by first showing that a well known model of <b>fairy</b> <b>ring</b> fungal growth and the Gray-Scott reaction-diffusion model are mathematically equivalent. We then use bifurcation analysis and numerical simulations to identify the conditions under which spiral waves and rotors can arise. We demonstrate that the region of dimensionless parameter space supporting these more complex dynamics is adjacent to that which produces the more familiar <b>fairy</b> <b>rings,</b> and identify experimental manipulations to test the transitions between these spatial modes. These same manipulations could also feasibly induce fungal colonies to transition from rotor/spiral formation to a set of richer, as yet unobserved, spatial patterns...|$|R

50|$|A <b>fairy</b> <b>ring,</b> {{also known}} as fairy circle, elf circle, elf ring or pixie ring, is a {{naturally}} occurring ring or arc of mushrooms.
