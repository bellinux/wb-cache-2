While Scientific Visualization {{techniques}} {{are used for}} the clarification of well-known phenomena, Information Visualization {{techniques are}} used for searching for interesting phenomena. There are therefore important {{differences between the two}} <b>fields</b> of <b>research.</b> The two <b>fields</b> of <b>research</b> are compared, but since this paper is meant for Scientific Visualization researchers, focus will be on explaining Information Visualization techniques.

5|$|Development began {{soon after}} Grand Theft Auto IVs release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The {{development}} team drew influence {{from many of}} their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3, and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted <b>field</b> <b>research</b> around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed {{by a team of}} producers who collaborated over several years.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game {{introduced}} a shift to a more realistic and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV had no strong cinematic influence, as the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted <b>field</b> <b>research</b> around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team.|$|E
5|$|Development of Life Is Strange {{began in}} April 2013. It was formed with an episodic format in mind, for reasons both {{financial}} and creative. The developers conducted <b>field</b> <b>research</b> on the setting by travelling to the Pacific Northwest, and subverted known archetypes {{to make the}} characters. Player feedback influenced the adjustments made to the episodes. Story and character arc serve as the central point in the game rather than traditional graphic adventure tropes like point-and-click puzzles. The voice recording sessions took place in Los Angeles.|$|E

50|$|<b>Field</b> of <b>Research</b> (FOR) - This {{classification}} allows both R&D {{activity and}} other activity within {{the higher education}} sector to be categorised. Prior to ASRC 1998, this information was collected using {{a different set of}} indicators called <b>Field</b> of <b>Research.</b> It was expanded in order that it can be used within the higher education sector to classify courses, units of study and teaching activity to field, and was renamed <b>Research</b> <b>Field,</b> Course and Discipline. The categories in the classification include recognised academic disciplines and related major sub-fields taught at universities or tertiary institutions, major <b>fields</b> of <b>research</b> investigated by national research institutions and organisations, and emerging areas of study. In the 2008 specification, this classification was again revised and its prior name (<b>Field</b> of <b>Research)</b> was again used. The FOR classification can be mapped to the OECD Fields of Science and Technology (FOS) classification in the Frascati Manual.|$|R
5|$|Early in 1953, Carson began {{library and}} <b>field</b> <b>research</b> on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she {{completed}} the third volume of her sea trilogy, The Edge of the Sea, {{which focuses on}} life in coastal ecosystems (particularly along the Eastern Seaboard). It appeared in The New Yorker in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; The Edge of the Sea received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for The Sea Around Us.|$|E
5|$|Hillforts in Scotland are earthworks, {{sometimes}} with wooden or stone enclosures, built on higher ground, which usually include a significant settlement, built within the modern boundaries of Scotland. They were first {{studied in the}} eighteenth century and the first serious <b>field</b> <b>research</b> was undertaken in the nineteenth century. In the twentieth century there were large numbers of archaeological investigations of specific sites, with an emphasis on establishing a chronology of the forts. Forts have been classified by type and their military and ritual functions have been debated.|$|E

5|$|L.A. Noires open {{world is}} a {{recreation}} of 1947 Los Angeles. The development team conducted <b>field</b> <b>research</b> in Los Angeles throughout the game's development, and compiled multiple aerial photographs to gather traffic and building information. Various plot points and investigations in the game are based on real life events, such as the Black Dahlia case. Like other games published by Rockstar, L.A. Noire uses licensed music provided by an in-game radio. Over 30 licensed tracks continuously loop on one radio station. The game also features an original score composed {{by a group of}} musicians and inspired by 1940s films.|$|E
5|$|Long-term <b>field</b> <b>research</b> {{has shown}} that range size, group size, social systems, and {{territorial}} behavior vary widely, and may be greatly affected by food distribution and quality. It is generally agreed that the ruffed lemur social system is multi-male/multi-female with a fission-fusion society, although some populations of black-and-white ruffed lemur have been reported as monogamous. This social flexibility is suspected to improve survivability despite an inflexible feeding ecology.|$|E
5|$|Sleeping Dogs {{difficult}} and prolonged development began in 2008.

Six months later, Square Enix bought the publishing rights and renamed the game Sleeping Dogs, without the True Crime license, but considered a spiritual successor.

5|$|The open {{world was}} {{modelled}} on Southern California and Los Angeles, and its design and in-game render constituted {{much of the}} game's early work. Key members of the game world production team took <b>field</b> <b>research</b> trips throughout the region and documented their research with photo and video footage. Google Maps projections of Los Angeles were used by the team to help design Los Santos' road networks. To reflect and reproduce Los Angeles' demographic spread, the developers studied census data and watched documentaries about the city. The team considered creating the open world the most technically demanding aspect of the game's production.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic Khmers have a poor {{perception}} of the Vietnamese community, due to persistent feelings of communal animosity from the past history of Vietnamese rule over Cambodia. In 1958, a survey conducted by Donald Willmott upon {{high school students in}} Phnom Penh showed that relations with Chinese were generally rated as friendly, whereas Khmer students viewed their Vietnamese classmates with suspicion. Relations between the Vietnamese and Chinese are considerably better, as both ethnic groups share a close cultural affinity. Chinese males sometimes take Vietnamese wives, particularly in Phnom Penh and eastern parts of the country where there are large Chinese and Vietnamese communities. In recent years, <b>field</b> <b>research</b> carried out by Ehrentraut in 2013 suggested that ethnic relations between Vietnamese have deteriorated not only with the ethnic Khmer, but also with the Cham and Chinese Cambodians.|$|E
5|$|Henry Walter Bates: (1825–1892) was an English explorer-naturalist who {{surveyed}} the Amazon rainforest with Alfred Russel Wallace in 1848. While Wallace returned in 1852, Bates remained {{for over a}} decade. His <b>field</b> <b>research</b> included collecting almost a hundred species of butterflies from the families Ithomiinae and Heliconiinae, as well as thousands of other insects specimens. In sorting these butterflies into similar groups based on appearance, inconsistencies began to arise. Some appeared superficially similar to others, even {{so much so that}} Bates could not tell some species apart based only on wing appearance. However, closer examination of less obvious morphological characters seemed to show that they were not even closely related. Shortly after his return to England he read a paper on his theory of mimicry {{at a meeting of the}} Linnean Society of London on 21 November 1861, which was then published in 1862 as 'Contributions to an Insect Fauna of the Amazon Valley' in the society's Transactions. He elaborated on his experiences further in The Naturalist on the River Amazons.|$|E
