25|$|Directly east {{of these}} areas, the weather becomes much harsher: {{precipitation}} drops to between 150 and 300mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao {{is a couple}} hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5°C warmer, rising up to 35°C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is −35°C, {{and it is not}} uncommon to see some nights 10°C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures.

40|$|Irrigation {{frequency}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important factors in drip irrigation scheduling, and a proper irrigation frequency can establish moderate moist and oxygen conditions in the root zone throughout the crop period. Field experiments on the effects of irrigation frequency on radish growth and water use were carried out in 2001 and 2002. The experiment included six irrigation frequencies: <b>once</b> <b>every</b> day, <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 2 days, <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 3 days, <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 4 days, <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 6 days and <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 8 days. There was no significant difference among the six treatments on radish development and yield, but significant differences in radish roots distribution and market quality were found. Radishes irrigated <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 3 days had well-developed roots throughout the crop period, the lowest cracking rate and the least number of radishes of Grade 3. The observation results of lysimeter in 2002 showed that radish evapotranspiration decreased as irrigation frequency decreased, and the general changing tendency of 2 -day ET of high irrigation frequency was related to that of 2 -day evaporation. It is recommended that radish irrigation frequency should be <b>once</b> <b>every</b> 3 days and the irrigation amount should be estimated according to the evaporation of 20 cm diameter pan in the North China Plain. © Springer-Verlag 2005...|$|R

In A narrative of the life of Mrs. Charlotte Charke, they talk to us about her child hood, Charlotte speaks about how she was born when her mother was forty five years of age, and not only was she late coming into the family, but she also felt as though she had been unwanted. She was the twelfth and last child born to actor/playwright poet laureate Colley Cibber and the musician/actress Katherine Shore. Most of her many siblings died before their first birthday. According to her autobiography, her brothers and sisters resented her arrival when she was young and many of them maintained their dislike throughout their lives.Charlotte was bold from a young age., family members and close friends of the family say that Charlotte began to show her “addiction” to manly activities at a young age. She was a great shot, she enjoyed, and was good at dressing horses, and at an early age preferred digging in the Gardens dirt.

The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who suggested an episode in which Lisa meets girls who {{thought she was a}} college student. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 12, 2002. Jean thought the idea was [...] "brilliant", and the subplot involving Bart in a [...] "germ-free" [...] plastic bubble was conceived by the writers wanting to make [...] "the most different subplot from an intellectual college plot" [...] they could think of. A scene in the episode shows Lisa talking to Bart on the branch of a tree in their garden.

500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song <b>every</b> <b>once</b> in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{usage of}} the word [...] "ironic" [...] {{attracted}} media attention for an improper application of the term; according to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, the song gives a distinct [...] "unironic" [...] sense in its implications. [...] According to the Oxford English Dictionary [...] "irony" [...] is [...] "a figure of speech in which the intended meaning {{is the opposite of}} that expressed by the words used". Thus, lyrics such as [...] "It's like rain on your wedding day" [...] and [...] "A traffic jam when you're already late" [...] are not ironic. Morissette commented about the writing of the song: [...] "For me the great debate on whether what I was saying in 'Ironic' was ironic wasn't a traumatic debate. I'd always embraced the fact that <b>every</b> <b>once</b> in a while I'd be the malapropism queen. And when Glen and I were writing it, we definitely were not doggedly making sure that everything was technically ironic". In 2014, Michael Reid Roberts penned for Salon.com a defense of the song's use of the term [...] "ironic", as the song cites situational ironies, which is defined as the [...] "state of affairs or event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often [...] amusing as a result", as some of the situations described in the lyrics could in fact be said to be [...] "ironic".|$|E
500|$|The {{traveller}} {{explains in}} [...] "Part III" [...] {{how he is}} the son of an Oxford mathematics professor. When young, he loved to read outdoors and wanted to know how the world worked. He became an architect and travelled throughout Europe. Eventually he married a lovely woman with whom he had a son, Henry. One day the couple left their son with his nurse during an outing and she fell asleep. When they returned, their son was gone, and he could not be found. The traveller spent years searching the countryside for his son; one day he met the woman, Dame Smithson, who had stolen his son. To please her sailor husband who wanted a child, she lied to him and said she was pregnant. Before his return, she needed a child, so she stole the traveller's. Unused to the harsh life of a peasant, the child suffered and became sickly. As a result, the woman's husband disliked him and beat him, believing him to be worthless. Hearing this story, Maurice reveals himself to be the traveller's son; he had changed his name to avoid the person he believed to be his cruel father. Overjoyed to be reunited with his son, the traveller buys the cottage for him and they return <b>every</b> <b>once</b> in a while. Maurice is educated, grows up, and travels widely. He returns to see that the cottage has disintegrated; he builds a new one for another poor fisherman's family, beside the lot of the old one.|$|E

As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen in most directions she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her {{in the back of a}} police car.
