50|$|The <b>Kerr</b> <b>Cell</b> <b>shutter</b> {{was used}} in the 1920-40s to measure the speed of light. A beam of light is timed between a laser and {{receiver}} while passing through a Kerr Cell. When the cell is activated the light beam is diverted and takes a different path to the receiver, this time difference is measured and the speed of light is calculated based on knowledge of the expected return time.|$|E
40|$|Methods for the {{production}} and detection of shock waves are reviewed with particular emphasis on {{the production}} of shock waves by exploding wires and by the absorption of energy from a pulsed laser system. An exploding wire system is described for the generation of shockwaves in perspex plates. Observation is made using the stress induced bi-refrigence, and 'time integrated' photographs of shock waves are produced. At lower energies the exploding wire produces a mixture of wire vapour and molten droplets. The disintegration of the droplets is shown and {{described in terms of}} the mechanism shown by Lane and Edwards (104) to operate forwater droplets. A modified <b>Kerr</b> <b>cell</b> <b>shutter</b> with an unsymmetric electrode geometry is described with reference to possible use as a fast light shutter for measuring shock wave velocities. A development of this shutter has one of the electrodes in the Kerr cell consisting of a stack of razor blades. Light which has been diffracted from an electrostrictively induced phase grating near the blade edges, has been detected. A number of mechanisms are described which take effect within the modified cell. A system {{for the production}} and detection of shock waves by a Q-switched ruby laser is described. Shock waves are produced in liquids both by electrical breakdown and by evaporation of the surface material from a metal target. Experimental results show the production of shock waves with velocities up to 10 4 m/s in water. The ablation wave produced when the surface of a metal wire is evaporated by a laser has been photographed. This shock wave accelerates as it moves towards the centre of the wire. Finally, the process of stimulated Brillouin scattering is described as the pulsed laser is focused into a liquid. <p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{work that}} demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} producing a gated digital holography system {{that is capable of}} producing high-resolution images of three-dimensional particle and structure details deep within dense particle fields of a spray. We developed a gated picosecond digital holocamera, using optical <b>Kerr</b> <b>cell</b> gating, to demonstrate features of gated digital holography that make it an exceptional candidate for this application. The <b>Kerr</b> <b>cell</b> gate <b>shuttered</b> the camera after the initial burst of ballistic and snake photons had been recorded, suppressing longer path, multiple scattered illumination. By starting with a CW laser without gating and then incorporating a picosecond laser and an optical Kerr gate, we were able to assess the imaging quality of the gated holograms, and determine improvement gained by gating. We produced high quality images of 50 – 200 μm diameter particles, hairs and USAF resolution charts from digital holograms recorded through turbid media where more than 98 % of the light was scattered from the field. The system can gate pulses as short as 3 mm in pathlength (10 ps), enabling image-improving features of the system. The experiments lead us to the conclusion that this method has an excellent capability as a diagnostics tool in dense spray combustion research...|$|R

50|$|Some polar liquids, such as {{nitrotoluene}} (C7H7NO2) and nitrobenzene (C6H5NO2) exhibit {{very large}} Kerr constants. A glass cell filled {{with one of}} these liquids is called a <b>Kerr</b> <b>cell.</b> These are frequently used to modulate light, since the Kerr effect responds very quickly to changes in electric field. Light can be modulated with these devices at frequencies as high as 10 GHz. Because the Kerr effect is relatively weak, a typical <b>Kerr</b> <b>cell</b> may require voltages as high as 30 kV to achieve complete transparency. This is in contrast to Pockels cells, which can operate at much lower voltages. Another disadvantage of <b>Kerr</b> <b>cells</b> is that the best available material, nitrobenzene, is poisonous. Some transparent crystals have also been used for Kerr modulation, although they have smaller Kerr constants.|$|R
40|$|Abstract, Considerable {{progress}} has been made recently on <b>Kerr</b> <b>cells.</b> In this paper the physical ground of this progress is examined. The optical defects of former <b>Kerr</b> <b>cells</b> were essentially due to the electric field distortions in the liquid proceeding from the space charges which attend the electric current. The various conduction regimes and the electric field distribution in these different cases are analysed. It is shown that in the most unfavourable case-unipolar injection, which is the most frequent regime under high voltage-the electric field distortion can be made very low if the conductivity of the liquid is sufficiently reduced. The importance of the ionic purification of the liquid is emphasized and methods for liquid de-ionization and injection decrease are described. In <b>Kerr</b> <b>cells</b> it is now possible to benefit fully by the quadratic nature of the electrical birefringence of liquids. 1...|$|R
40|$|Laser guide star systems {{based on}} Rayleigh {{scattering}} require some means {{to deal with}} the flash of low altitude laser light that follows immediately after each laser pulse. These systems also need a fast shutter to isolate the high altitude portion of the focused laser beam to make it appear star-like to the wavefront sensor. We describe how these tasks are accomplished with UnISIS, the Rayleigh laser guided adaptive optics system at the Mt. Wilson Observatory 2. 5 -m telescope. We use several methods: a 10, 000 RPM rotating disk, dichroics, a fast sweep and clear mode of the CCD readout electronics on a 10 µs timescale, and a Pockel’s <b>cell</b> <b>shutter</b> system. The Pockel’s <b>cell</b> <b>shutter</b> would be conventional in design if the laser light were naturally polarized, but the UnISIS 351 nm laser is unpolarized.

30|$|The InAs/GaSb SL {{is grown}} by {{molecular}} beam epitaxy [MBE] on n-type doped (100) GaSb substrates. The growth temperature was set at 450 °C and a V/III ration of 5 : 1. There are two important issues uniquely associated with InAs/GaSb SL growth: (1) InAs has 0.75 % smaller lattice constant than GaSb, and proper interface layers, in typical InSb, have to be inserted between the InAs and GaSb layers for strain balance and (2) interface control is extremely important to obtain high-quality epitaxial materials {{since there are no}} common atoms between InAs and GaSb. Shutter sequences were carefully designed to favor an InSb-like interface layer with a desired thickness. InSb-like interfaces were realized through proper shutter sequences. An important issue is to suppress the arsenic flux at the interface growth since arsenic has a high background pressure in a MBE chamber. At GaSb-to-InAs interfaces, we first closed the gallium <b>cell</b> <b>shutter,</b> left the antimony <b>cell</b> <b>shutter</b> open for 2 s, and then opened the indium cell for 0.8 s before opening the arsenic shutter for the InAs growth. At the InAs-to-GaSb interface, we first closed the arsenic shutter and left the indium shutter open for 1 s to have the growing surface covered by one layer of indium atoms, then closed the indium shutter, and opened the antimony shutter to switch to the GaSb growth. With the above shutter sequence, we greatly reduced the arsenic background pressure during the InSb and GaSb growth. The SL crystal qualities, such as the period and the lattice-mismatch from the GaSb substrates, were characterized by high-resolution X-ray diffraction [HRXRD]. The surface quality was measured by atomic force microscopy [AFM].|$|R

40|$|The {{electrical}} breakdown strength of insulating materials {{is a major}} limiting factor of reliability in electric power, medical devices, and other high electric field applications. Electrical breakdown strength increase results in increased reliability and energy storage in high voltage capacitors and other devices. If a correlation can be found between the breakdown strength and the electric field distribution when a voltage is applied without {{electrical breakdown}}, then {{this may be a}} critical step toward non-destructive electrical breakdown tests. The generation and transport of space charge in high voltage stressed dielectric liquids are not well understood or controlled. Electric field distributions, distorted by space charge, cannot be calculated from knowledge of the electrode configuration, dielectric properties, and source excitation alone. In this work, the Kerr effect, an electro-optic method based on field-induced birefringence, is used to measure the electric field and space charge distributions between a pair of high voltage stressed identical or different metal electrodes. The non-uniformities in the electric field can then be mapped to determine the shape of space charge distortion of the electric field distribution for each electrode pair configuration. A large well monitored <b>Kerr</b> <b>cell</b> was built to replace a previously used small <b>Kerr</b> <b>cell,</b> and incorporated many improvements to the systems measurement accuracy and repeatability. The electrode pairs were combinations of similar and dissimilar metals. The similar electrode pairs provided double checks of the testing process with the voltage polarity reversed.

30|$|The {{investigated}} QW sample {{consists of}} a 500 -nm-thick buffer GaAs layer, the GaAsBi/GaAs QW, and finally a 100 -nm-thick cap layer. After {{the growth of the}} buffer layer at 580 °C, the temperature is lowered to 365 °C, the value selected for the QW growth. The As cell valve opening is reduced in order to yield the As 4 flux corresponding to a V/III atomic ratio close to unity, as needed for GaAsBi growth [9]; the As cell is a RIBER VCAS 700 cracker (Bezons, France) one whose nose temperature is set to 650 °C, thus mostly ejecting As 4 species. At the same time, the Ga cell temperature is decreased to a value which leads to a low growth rate for GaAs, of the order of 0.25 ml/s. After substrate temperature cooling, care is taken to get temperature stabilization since this parameter {{plays a major role in}} Bi incorporation [7]. At this step, the Ga and Bi <b>cell</b> <b>shutters</b> are opened simultaneously. For the first period of growth, bismuth plays the role of a surfactant for the low-temperature-grown GaAs [9], until a (2 [*]×[*] 1) reconstruction of a bismuth-rich GaAs surface [10] is observed, the required condition for efficient incorporation of this element into GaAs [11]. Then, the bismuth element contributes to the formation of a GaAsBi QW. At the end of the QW growth, the Bi <b>cell</b> <b>shutter</b> is closed first. The Ga shutter is only closed once a 5 -nm layer of GaAs has been grown; we have observed that the GaAs RHEED pattern deteriorates for a GaAs layer thickness higher than 5 to 10 nm, after the floating bismuth was incorporated in GaAs or desorbed [7]. The growth is then interrupted to heat the structure temperature to 520 °C.
