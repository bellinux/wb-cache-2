5|$|In the {{drafts of}} the Alien Resurrection screenplay, writer Joss Whedon {{included}} a death {{scene in which}} a lifeform was sucked through {{a gap in the}} <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> a ship. In the second draft, Perez was sucked through a fist-sized breach in the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the Auriga; this was changed in the final version to the Newborn being sucked through the window of the Betty. 20th Century Fox executives were skeptical about the final version, seeing it as a comedic scene contrasting with the overall tone of the Alien franchise, but director Jean-Pierre Jeunet persuaded them to leave the scene in.|$|E
5|$|Auditory camouflage, {{at least}} in the form of noise reduction, is practised in various ways. The {{rubberized}} <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> military submarines absorbs sonar waves and {{can be seen as a}} form of auditory camouflage. Some modern helicopters are designed to be quiet. Combat uniforms are usually equipped with buttons rather than snap fasteners or velcro to reduce noise.|$|E
5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth.

5|$|Later, von Neumann {{suggested}} a new method of linear programming, using the homogeneous linear system of Gordan (1873), which was later popularized by Karmarkar's algorithm. Von Neumann's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices, with the pivoting decision {{determined by a}} nonnegative least squares subproblem with a convexity constraint (projecting the zero-vector onto the convex <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the active simplex). Von Neumann's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming.|$|E

5|$|At about 06:00 on 9 October 1913, , a Royal Line ship under {{charter to}} the Uranium Line, caught {{fire in a}} gale on the North Atlantic. The crew fought the fire for about two hours, but, realizing the {{severity}} of the fire and the limited options for dousing it in the high seas, Captain Francis Inch of Volturno had his wireless operator send out SOS signals. The westbound Kroonland, already beyond Volturnos location, turned east to aid the burning liner. In the meantime, several of Volturnos lifeboats with women and children aboard were launched with tragic results: all those aboard the lifeboats were killed as the boats capsized or were smashed by the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the heaving ship.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{continues}} his mission in Jamaica, where he meets a local fisherman, Quarrel, and John Strangways, {{the head of}} the local MI6 station. Quarrel gives Bond training in scuba diving in the local waters. Bond swims through shark- and barracuda-infested waters to Mr Big's island and manages to plant a limpet mine on the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> his yacht before being captured once again by Mr Big. Bond is reunited with Solitaire; the following morning Mr Big ties the couple to a line behind his yacht and plans to drag them over the shallow coral reef and into deeper water so that the sharks and barracuda that he attracts in to the area with regular feedings will eat them.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} {{elements}} on early splitting and the effects of phenolic compounds and gallic acid on the control of aflatoxins, an experiment was conducted at Rafsanjan Pistachio Research Station. At harvest time fruits of 15 clusters of each variety (Ahmadaghaii, Kalleghuchi, Ohadi) pollinated freely were collected randomly and their phenolic compounds and gallic acid contents were determined. Also from tree of each variety huge numbers of early-split, regular crack and healthy fruits were collected and their green hulls were examined for their macro and micro elements. The tests were conducted by factorial in the form of fully random blocks and the results were analyzed based on Duncan classification by SAS and Sigma Plot in three replicates. The highest amount of nitrogen (2. 15 %) was found in the <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> healthy fruits and its minimum was observed in the <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> early-split and irregular crack fruits (1. 94 % and 1. 97 %). Maximum magnesium was observed in <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> healthy fruit and minimum of it was found in <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> early-split ones (0. 10 %). The highest rate of phenolic compounds was found in green <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> Ohadi fruits (1398 mg/ 100 g.) and the lowest rate was observed in green <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> Ahmadaghaii (1131 mg/ 100 g.) variety. Results indicated that an increase in the phenolic compounds content causes a reduction or control of aflatoxins production in pistachio fruits.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} closed convex <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> unitary orbits in various C$^*$-algebras. For unital C$^*$-algebras with real rank zero and a {{faithful}} tracial state determining equivalence of projections, {{a notion of}} majorization describes the closed convex <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> unitary orbits for self-adjoint operators. Other notions of majorization are examined in these C$^*$-algebras. Combining these ideas with the Dixmier property, we demonstrate unital, infinite dimensional C$^*$-algebras of real rank zero and strict comparison of projections {{with respect to a}} faithful tracial state must be simple and have a unique tracial state. Also, closed convex <b>hulls</b> <b>of</b> unitary orbits of self-adjoint operators are fully described in unital, simple, purely infinite C$^*$-algebras...|$|R
5|$|Limitations {{imposed by}} the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty {{prevented}} the class from being completed as designed. However, the treaty had a limited allowance for hulls already under construction to be converted into aircraft carriers. Amagi and Akagi were both intended for conversion, but an earthquake damaged the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> Amagi so extensively that the ship was scrapped. Akagi was reconstructed as an aircraft carrier and served with distinction {{as part of the}} Kido Butai during the Second World War, participating in the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor before being sunk at the Battle of Midway.|$|E
5|$|No pre-dreadnoughts served postWorld War II as armed ships; {{the last}} serving pre-dreadnought was the former SMS Hessen, {{which was used}} as a target ship by the Soviet union into the early 1960s as the Tsel. The <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the former USS Kearsarge (BB-5) served as a crane ship from 1920 until its {{scrapping}} in 1955.

5|$|The {{ship was}} based on the {{incomplete}} <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> the Italian passenger ship Ausonia, which was being built in Hamburg. The conversion was proposed by the Air Department of the Reichs Navy Office, but it was abandoned after negotiations within the German Navy over a proposed moratorium on new ships {{at the end of the}} war. After World War I ended, high inflation in Germany added to the cost of the ship, and as a result, the Italian shipping company for whom the ship was originally built, declined to purchase her. The vessel was therefore sold to shipbreakers and dismantled in 1922.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} officially laid down on 19 December 1912, but work {{did not begin}} until March–April 1913. After a {{progress}} review on 4 June 1914, launching of the first pair of ships was delayed until October 1914. When World War I began, the <b>hull</b> <b>of</b> Izmail, the most advanced ship, was judged 43percent complete, with the others lagging considerably behind. The war caused more delays, including problems obtaining imported components, and the ships were competing for scarce resources with other production deemed necessary for the war. Three of the four ships were launched in 1915, {{but it was clear}} that Russian industry {{would not be able to}} complete them during the war, mostly because the turrets were seriously delayed. They were reclassified as 2nd rank projects by the Main Administration of Shipbuilding in 1916.|$|E
