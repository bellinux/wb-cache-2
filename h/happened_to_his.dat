Buck (Nathan Fillion) arrives and introduces Dare (Tricia Helfer). Romeo wakes the Rookie {{and the team}} enter their HEVs and drop through the atmosphere; at the last minute, Dare changes their trajectory to miss the ship. The Covenant ship enters slipspace, sending a shockwave toward the ODSTs; the Rookie's pod collides with Mickey's and crashes into a building on the ground, knocking him unconscious for six hours. He awakens and proceeds to find clues as to what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> squadmates.|$|E

Believing it to have been perpetrated by someone in the office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees, whom he considers his friends. Michael tries talking to his former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him {{that he does not}} need to have his employees be his friends. But his mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by his obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of his voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Nesbitt {{appeared}} in Wall of Silence, a fact-based drama about {{the aftermath of}} the murder of schoolboy Jamie Robe. Nesbitt played Stuart Robe, the boy's father, who tries to break down the wall of silence in the local community to discover exactly what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son. He had only just completed Bloody Sunday when he was offered the part and was unsure whether he wanted to take on such a demanding role so soon after playing Ivan Cooper. He decided to accept the part because he found it interesting. To prepare for the role, Nesbitt met with Robe and spent weeks talking to him in his South London flat, learning about Jamie, and of Robe's fight for his justice. Nesbitt spoke with his natural accent instead of affecting Robe's South London speech, as he did not want the audience to be distracted from the drama. The single-drama was filmed over four weeks and broadcast in January 2004. The role gained Nesbitt an IFTA nomination for Best Actor in a TV Drama later that year.|$|E

Louvois, Louis’ war minister, wanted to order Luxembourg to immediately besiege Namur or Charleroi, but Louis, concerned about the dauphin’s forces on the Rhine, ordered Luxembourg to detach part of his forces and forgo a major siege. Louvois objected, but King Louis {{wanted to be sure}} that nothing ‘disagreeable’ <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son’s command. Nevertheless, Luxembourg was able to put much of the land east of Brussels under contribution.|$|E

25|$|Mulder's {{ultimate}} {{goal was to}} uncover what he {{believed to be a}} government conspiracy to hide the truth about alien life, and to find out what had <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister. His quest and belief in the existence of aliens was, for most of the series, the driving force of the plot, or mytharc. However, during a period of time after Scully's cancer went into remission (season 5), Mulder was convinced by Michael Kritschgau that aliens did not in fact exist, and that the government conspirators had merely concocted that threat as a smokescreen, to justify military activities and toy with him.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{years went}} by before Raleigh {{decided to find out}} what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> colony. Led by Samuel Mace, this 1602 {{expedition}} differed from previous voyages in that Raleigh bought his own ship and guaranteed the sailors' wages so {{that they would not be}} distracted by privateering. However, Raleigh still hoped to make money from the trip, and Mace's ship landed in the Outer Banks to gather aromatic woods or plants such as sassafras that would generate a decent profit back in England. By the time they could turn their attention to the colonists, the weather had turned bad and they were forced to return without even making it to Roanoke Island. By this time, having been arrested for treason, Raleigh was unable to send any further missions.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} free {{practice}} crash between Nakajima and Jarvis, Davidson called for cars to {{be equipped with}} brighter flashing rain lights and that what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> co-driver was [...] "every driver's worst nightmare". He suggested Formula One rain lights provided by McLaren Electronic Systems were brighter than those employed in the World Endurance Championship. Toyota's technical director Pascal Vasselon believed Nakajima's lack of reaction time along with the absence of flashing rain lights contributed to his injury. Christopher Reinke, Audi Sport's Le Mans Prototype manager, stated such a measure had been discussed but the issue was complex, while the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's (ACO) sporting manager, Vincent Beaumesnil, said he was unsure that brighter lights would have assisted Nakajima. In early June, the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the ACO, required all Le Mans Prototype cars carry additional flashing rain lights {{at the rear of}} their cars from the 24 Hours of Le Mans onward after the FIA's Endurance Committee observed their usage under wet weather conditions and felt there was an improvement in visibility.|$|E
500|$|The {{story for}} [...] "Release" [...] was {{developed}} by John Shiban and David Amann; the teleplay was written by Amann. Kim Manners helmed the directing of the episode. [...] "Release" [...] was originally going to be written by Shiban alone, but he later turned the script over to Amann because he was needed elsewhere at the time. Shiban had been desiring {{to write a story}} like [...] "Release" [...] for a while. The character of Hayes was crafted as an ambitious character, inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle: he was written to be either a [...] "brilliant guy who's solving crimes with his amazing intuition", comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or [...] "a guy who's actually doing those crimes and playing a game", like Professor Moriarty. Shiban and Amman came up with a story wherein Scully encounters a [...] "genius" [...] from her classes at the FBI Academy at Quantico. Later on, they extrapolated on the story, allowing the [...] "genius" [...] crime solver to help John Doggett find out what <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> son, Luke Doggett.|$|E
