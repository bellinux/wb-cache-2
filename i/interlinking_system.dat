40|$|Abstract. Linked data {{interlinking}} is {{the discovery}} of all instances that represent the same real-world object and locate in different data sources. Since different data publishers frequently use different schemas for storing resources, we aim at developing a schema-independent <b>interlinking</b> <b>system.</b> Our system automatically selects important predicates and useful predicate alignments, which are used as the key for blocking and instance matching. The key distinction of our system {{is the use of}} weighted co-occurrence and adaptive filtering in blocking and instance matching. Experimental results show that the system highly improves the precision and recall over some recent ones. The performance of the system and the efficiency of main steps are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The goal of {{instance}} matching is {{to detect}} identity resources, which {{refer to the}} same real-world object. In this paper, we introduce SLINT+, a novel <b>interlinking</b> <b>system.</b> SLINT+ detects all identity linked data resources between two given repositories. SLINT+ {{does not require the}} specifications of RDF predicates and labeled matching resources. SLINT+ performs competitively at OAEI instance matching campaign this year. 1 Presentation of the system The problem of detecting instances co-referring to the same real-world object is positively important in data integration. It is useful for reducing the heterogeneity and warranting the consistency of data. The asynchronous development of linked data increasingly requires the specific linked data instance matching algorithms to connect existing instances and newly added instances. In linked data, the differences of data representation appear not only in object values, but also in RDF predicates, which specify the meaning of objects properties. This issue is popularly found in different data repositories or even the same repository bu...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Measurements of the {{viscosity}} {{and density}} of seven binary mixtures composed of methylcyclohexane 2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 8, 8 -heptamethylnonane {{along with the}} pure compounds have been performed in the temperature range 293. 15 ^ 353. 15 K and up to 100 MPa. The viscosity was measured up to 100 MPa with a falling-body viscometer, except at 0. 1 MPa where a classical capillary viscometer was used. The experimental uncertainty for the measured viscosities is 2 %. The density was measured up to 60 MPa with a resonance densimeter and extrapolated with a Tait-type relationship up to 100 MPa. The accuracy of the reported densities is better than 1 kg mÿ 3. On {{the basis of the}} obtained data, an analysis of the excess activation energy for viscous flow versus temperature, pressure, and composition has been performed, showing that the excess activation energy for viscous flow is positive with a maximum value of 700 J molÿ 1, corresponding to a weakly <b>interlinking</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, simple mixing laws (Grunberg ^Nissan and Katti ^ Chaudhri) have been evaluated in order to analyse the possibility of estimating the viscosity of the binary system under consideration from the viscosity and density of the pure compounds. ...|$|E

The assembly line-in i its first (Fordist) form, as in the `restructured ' form which it is to ~ take-must be examined in both of its aspects: As a technology of'f control of living labour, and as a structure for the realisation of value. The new assembly line {{is the beginning of}} a new `economy ' of time and control, which allows for the reproduction of the essential l mechanisms of production in the mass-production of standardised I commodities (a structure necessary for modern mass-production), while adapting these to present-day conditions in the labour market,, and to working class resistance. These experiments aim to replace the traditional assembly line with an alternative model based on `autonomous ' production groups. In order fully to appreciate their significance, we must first outline the basic characteristics of Fordism. Fordism derives essentially from the techniques of time and motion study inaugurated by Taylorism-but it contains at least two new essential characteristics: [2] i. the introduction of an <b>interlinking</b> <b>system</b> of conveyor lines and tracks (the `line'). This ensures, by mechanical means, the ordered transfer of the components to be worked on, and there-by establishes the principle of 'continuous-flow production" [See Emery (b) ], at the same time, the establishment of the `line ' makes it possible, in very many jobs, for the skilled worker to be replaced by unskilled labour, which is more flexible and has less capacity for resistance. ii. standardisation and the new techniques of assembly now allow commodities to be produced on a mass scale; the resulting economies of scale, as well as the advance in the extraction of surplus labour, allow substantial reductions in the unit value of commodities produced in this way...|$|E

40|$|AbstractMutual {{inhibitory}} {{positive feedback}} (MIPF), or double-negative feedback, {{is a key}} regulatory motif of cellular memory with the capability of maintaining switched states for transient stimuli. Such MIPFs are found in various biological systems where they are interlinked in many cases despite a single MIPF can still realize such a memory effect. An intriguing question then arises about the advantage of interlinking MIPFs instead of exploiting an isolated single MIPF to realize the memory effect. We have investigated the advantages of <b>interlinked</b> MIPF <b>systems</b> through mathematical modeling and computer simulations. Our results revealed that interlinking MIPFs expands the parameter range of achieving the memory effect, or the memory region, thereby making the system more robust to parameter perturbations. Moreover, the minimal duration and amplitude of an external stimulus required for off-to-on state transition are increased and, as a result, external noises can more effectively be filtered out. Hence, <b>interlinked</b> MIPF <b>systems</b> can realize more robust cellular memories with respect to both parameter perturbations and external noises. Our study suggests that <b>interlinked</b> MIPF <b>systems</b> might be an evolutionary consequence acquired for a more reliable memory effect by enhancing robustness against noisy cellular environments...|$|R

A variable that had a positive impact on a family business agreement was total experience of the business owner. Further, three variables increased the probability of having a family business agreement: separation of family and family business, perception that family comes first, and conflict that arises when decisions are in favor of the family versus the family business. The variable that had a negative impact on a family business agreement was division of ownership. Moreover, tension due to unresolved conflict decreased the probability of having a family business agreement. ...|$|R
