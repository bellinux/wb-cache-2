6000|$|Frank's {{house in}} Mulinuu was {{likewise}} filled with wounded; many dead bodies were brought in; I hear with certainty of five, wrapped in mats; and a pastor goes to-morrow {{to the field}} to bring others. The Laupepas brought in eleven heads to Mulinuu, and to the great horror and consternation of the native mind, one {{proved to be a}} girl, and was identified as that of a Taupou--or Maid of the Village--from Savaii. I hear this morning, with great relief, that it has been returned to Malie, wrapped in the most costly silk handkerchiefs, and with an apologetic embassy. This could easily happen. The girl was of course attending on her father with ammunition, and got shot; her hair was cut short to make her father's war head-dress--even as our own Sina's is at this moment; and the <b>decollator</b> was probably, in his red flurry of fight, wholly unconscious of her sex. I am sorry for him in the future; he must make up his mind to many bitter jests--perhaps to vengeance. But what an end to one chosen for her beauty and, in the time of peace, watched over by trusty crones and hunchbacks! ...|$|E
