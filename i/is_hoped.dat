His father, a merchant named Raden Potronojo, orders Hidjo to go to the Netherlands and attend university; this <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> to give the family greater status, as generally only priyayi (noble) families send their children abroad for schooling. Meanwhile, Dutch administrator Willem Walter, who views the Javanese positively, is engaged to a Dutch woman named Jet Roos; Roos is pregnant with his child.|$|E

The lowered borrowing rates have also caused the euro to fall {{in relation to other}} currencies, which <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> will boost exports from the eurozone and further aid the recovery.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Darren Tanke of the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology in Drumheller, Alberta {{relocated}} the long lost S. parksi site. Pieces of the skull, evidently abandoned by the 1915 crew, {{were found in the}} quarry. These were collected and it <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> more pieces will be found, perhaps enough to warrant a redescription of the skull and test whether S. albertensis and S. parksi are the same. The Tyrrell Museum has also collected several partial Styracosaurus skulls. At least one confirmed bonebed (bonebed 42) in Dinosaur Provincial Park has also been explored (other proposed Styracosaurus bonebeds instead have fossils from a mix of animals, and nondiagnostic ceratopsian remains). Bonebed 42 is known to contain numerous pieces of skulls such as horncores, jaws and frill pieces.|$|E

5|$|Poliomyelitis {{has existed}} for {{thousands}} of years, with depictions of the disease in ancient art. The disease was first recognized as a distinct condition by Michael Underwood in 1789 and {{the virus that causes}} it was first identified in 1908 by Karl Landsteiner. Major outbreaks started to occur in the late 19th century in Europe and the United States. In the 20th century it {{became one of the most}} worrying childhood diseases in these areas. The first polio vaccine was developed in the 1950s by Jonas Salk. It <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> that vaccination efforts and early detection of cases will result in global eradication of the disease by 2018.|$|E
5|$|The Avro Museum , based out of CYBW west of Calgary, Alberta, Canada is {{building}} a 2/3rd scale, manned, high performance flying replica of the Avro Arrow (officially known as ARROW II) to Canadian Aviation Experimental Aircraft Regulations {{in order to become}} an airshow demonstration aircraft. Construction began in October 2007, and by 2012 the fuselage was completed and passed its first MDRA inspection, and now has a serial number. Powered by a pair of Pratt & Whitney JT-15D-4s, the ARROW II will have a top speed of approximately 500 knots and a range of 1,800 miles. Current projections show a final cost of the project at approximately one million dollars and it <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> that ground tests will start in about 2016 with the first flight to follow.|$|E
5|$|The Wensleydale Railway {{is reached}} by a bus service, {{operated}} by Dales & District, which runs from Northallerton {{to the current}} terminus of the railway at Leeming Bar, from where trains run to Redmire.

At the moment there are some limited goods, engineering and excursion trains using the North Curve.|$|E

5|$|The {{small and}} {{isolated}} {{nature of the}} site makes it susceptible to damage from the surrounding area. For example, herbicides, thought to be generally damaging for the species richness, could get onto the site from the drift of spray from surrounding fields. To help combat this the maintenance of mature hedgerows around the perimeter is encouraged. As of 2006 the condition of Whitton Bridge Pasture is described as favourable, {{which means that the}} land is being adequately conserved and any conservation objectives are being met, but that there is scope for enhancement of the site. The condition of the site was also described as favourable in 2004 and 2005 assessments. In the future it <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> that the grazing regime will become more regularised and will be of high priority.|$|E
5|$|With {{water levels}} above the {{structure}} remaining fairly constant, Â£400,000 {{was spent on}} refurbishing City Mills Lock. Although some work had been carried out in 2006, including the fitting of new metal gates, it was not operational, and had not been used for around 40 years. The second phase of restoration included fitting the equipment to automate its operation. The first public use of the lock occurred on 31 July 2010. British Waterways hoped to restore the Carpenters Road Lock soon afterwards, but the project was postponed until {{after the completion of}} the Olympic games, as temporary 'Land Bridges' were erected over the site of the lock to enable pedestrians to reach the stadium, some of which will be removed after the event. Following the Olympic games, it <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> the waterways will continue to be used by both commercial and leisure craft.|$|E
5|$|Flying foxes {{often come}} to the {{attention}} of Australian wildlife care and rescue organisations, such as Wildcare Australia, ONARR, Wildlife Carers Darling Downs, Bat Care, Bat Rescue, Tweed Valley Wildlife Carers, WIRES, and Wildlife Victoria when reported as injured, sick, orphaned, or abandoned. A very high proportion of adult flying fox injuries are caused by entanglement in barbed wire fences or backyard fruit tree netting, both of which can result in very serious injuries and a slow, agonising death for the animal if not rescued quickly. More recently wildlife advocacy groups such the Victorian Advocates for Animals has used the commercial development of a range of wildlife safe fruit tree netting products to push for regulations to make it illegal to install wildlife unsafe nets on backyard fruit trees. These new products have as their chief characteristic small apertures / holes of 5mm x 5mm or less. Flying foxes are able to climb across the netting without being entangled. It <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> the uptake of wildlife safe netting products will see a marked decline in flying fox entanglements across time and subsequent reduction in public risk and the burden on wildlife rescue and rehabilitation volunteers.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 2012, Knight Frank {{announced}} that administrators Ernst & Young had entered into an exclusive agreement with Malaysian developers SP Setia and Sime Darby, {{who were given}} 28 days to conduct due diligence and agree the final terms of the deal. Completion of the sale to the Malaysian consortium took place in September 2012. The redevelopment of the site will use the existing Vinoly master plan which intends to position the Power Station as the central focus of the regenerated 40-acre site, housing a blend of shops, cafes, restaurants, art and leisure facilities, office space and residential accommodation. The plan includes {{the restoration of the}} historic Power Station itself, {{the creation of a new}} riverside park to the north of the Power Station and the creation of a new High Street which is designed to link the future entrance to Battersea Power Station tube station with the Power Station. The redevelopment <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> to bring about the extension of the existing riverside walk and facilitate access directly from the Power Station to Battersea Park and Chelsea Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Over Â£840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK local {{authorities}} was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council met {{to try to persuade}} the Treasury to secure the money {{in the same way that}} customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of all the local authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently Â£50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at Â£40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It <b>is</b> <b>hoped</b> that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E
5|$|The town lies on {{the ancient}} Watling Street, but is not {{recorded}} before the 17th century, although Ogley Hay, which in modern times is a district of the town, is recorded as a settlement in the Domesday Book. Brownhills quickly grew around the coal mining industry, especially after it became linked to the canal and railway networks in the mid-19th century, {{and by the end}} of the century had grown from a hamlet of only 300 inhabitants to a town with a population of over , of whom the vast majority were employed in the coal industry. Mining remained the town's principal industry until the 1950s, but the subsequent closure of the area's pits led to a severe economic decline which has continued until the present day.
