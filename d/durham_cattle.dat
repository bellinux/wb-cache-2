Following Juárez Celman's {{resignation}} in 1890, Cárcano toured Europe, returning in 1891 to his estancia {{on the banks of}} the Tercero River. There, he introduced Polled <b>Durham</b> <b>cattle,</b> a vaccine against anthrax that had been prepared at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, and an imported steam plough (becoming the first landowner in Argentina to use these innovations). Cárcano wrote numerous historical works during this period, notably El general Quiroga y la expedición al desierto (1882), Perfiles contemporáneos (1885), La universidad de Córdoba (1892), Historia de los medios de comunicación y transporte en la Argentina (1893), Estudios coloniales (1895), and La reforma universitaria (1901), and was inducted into the National Academy of History of Argentina in 1901. Named President of the Agricultural Education Advisory Commission in 1907, he joined the Higher Institute of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine, becoming the school's first dean upon its 1909 incorporation into the University of Buenos Aires. Among his best-known works outside the subject of history was Evolución histórica del régimen de la tierra pública, a study on eminent domain.|$|E

50|$|By {{the early}} 1970s, the Beef Shorthorn breeders were {{concerned}} their cattle {{were too small}} and lacked muscle, especially {{when compared with the}} continental breeds of cattle, such as the Charolais or Limousin - that were starting to be introduced to the UK. To help remedy this, in 1976, the Beef Shorthorn Cattle Society sanctioned the introduction of Maine-Anjou blood into the breed. The Maine-Anjou breed, developed in France, was descended from the same <b>Durham</b> <b>cattle</b> as the Shorthorn. The decision to introduce Maine-Anjou blood into the Beef Shorthorn breed was very controversial at the time, but most breeders now acknowledge it was a necessary step which saved the breed from irrelevance. The herd book was closed to Maine-Anjou blood lines in 2001, except by introduction through the Grading Register.|$|E

40|$|Many of {{the living}} {{heritage}} breeds are threatened by extinction due {{to the loss of}} their original function and/or competition with specialized breeds. The aim of this PhD research was to assess how genomic information may support the conservation of these living heritage breeds with the focus on two Belgian heritage breeds: Campine cattle and Belgian Draught horse. We did not only evaluate the genetic diversity in the Campine cattle and Belgian Draught horse, but also visualized the historical between breed relationships, the identification of selective sweeps in draught horses, and the identification of genomic regions associated to chronic progressive lymphedema, a complex disorder in the Belgian Draught horse. This PhD research assessed whether and to what extent exogenous genes still affect the authenticity of the Campine breed at a genomic level. Furthermore, the current population structure, genetic diversity, and introgression with phenotypically similar and/or historically related breeds such as MRY, Deep Red, Improved Red, Eastern Belgian Red and White was assessed. Introgression with Holstein and beef cattle genotypes in the Campine population was found to be limited to just a few farms. While the current population shows a substantial amount of within breed variation, the majority of genotypes can be separated from other breeds included in the study, supporting the re-establishment of the Campine breed. The majority of the population is genetically close to the Deep Red, Improved Red, and Eastern Belgium Red and White, breeds known for their historical ties to the Campine breed. These results could support the creation of an open herdbook policy among these populations which would increase the genetic breeding pool and may provide a more secure future for the breed. The past and current market stimulates farmers to utilize crossbreeding and/or breed replacement in their living heritage populations to accelerate genetic improvement and increase output. While bulls from the <b>Durham</b> <b>cattle</b> breed were often used to improve beef production {{at the turn of the}} 19 th century, the use of Holstein breeding bulls being preferred towards the second half of the 20 th century to upgrade milking traits. Additionally, the local populations themselves were part of transboundary cattle populations in which exchange occurred frequently. To assess whether historical ties are still present in modern day populations, the current local diversity was evaluated using the method of Eding. This also allows to assess whether a genetic print was left by recent Holstein and more distant Durham crosses. This method is used within and between breed kinships to create a core set. The use of the average kinship between and within populations demonstrated that many of the historical relationships among dual-purpose cattle breeds are still visible in the modern- day populations. However, in some cases the known historical ties between local breeds were difficult to reveal like for example in the Campine breed. This breed is still very diverse, which may have resulted in a low average kinship to other local breeds. Traces of these historical ties can still be seen when removing the breed from the core set as it resulted in increased contributions from many other local breeds. The results also highlighted the selection that took place against the presence of Durham genetics in local population as most of the current day dual-purpose populations no longer show a close relationship with Durham. When the genomic relationship between related breeds were less present this might have been a consequence of within breed selection, bottlenecks, and/or founder effects. Although popular for its specific draught conformation and willingness to work until the beginning of the 20 th century, the population of the Belgian Draught horse has decreased these past decades. This decline in population size is accompanied by an increasing concern for its genetic diversity. However, errors in pedigree recording and lack of pedigree depth make it difficult to utilize pedigree-based estimates. Furthermore, its conformation made it particularly suited for heavy labor and selection towards this end may still be visible in the presence of selective sweeps. Comparing pedigree-based and genomic estimates of inbreeding shows that the two differ substantially. While the effective population size based on pedigree and genomic information was similar, the pedigree-based estimates failed to reveal the substructure detected using PCA. This discrepancy can be explained by the ability of the genomic methods to detect population substructure and inbreeding caused by more distant relatedness predating pedigree recording, errors in pedigree recording, and/or import of horses. Within and between breed analyses showed a close relationship between the Belgian and Ardenner Draught and a more distant one with the Flemish Draught and Rhenish German Coldblood. As historical records show the historical ties between the four breeds, it is possible that a combination of founder effect, selection, genetic drift, and inbreeding led to the between-breed divergence. Finally, several signatures of selection on the chromosomes ECA 3, ECA 5, ECA 10, ECA 11, ECA 18 have been reported previously and are thought to be involved in both performance, conformation, coat color, and hereditary disorders. Finally, the intense selection on conformation and heavy limbs with abundant feathering in the Belgian Draught horse was likely accompanied with a selection for a condition called chronic progressive lymphedema. It results in a progressive lower limb swelling and deformation of the soft tissues of which the underlying cause remains unknown. Currently, two diverging hypotheses have been proposed; the first considers elastin alterations as the initial trigger of progressive lymphedema while the second considers chronic progressive lymphedema as an inflammatory dermatitis. Through the use of genome-wide and homozygosity association analyses the genetic background of this disease was analyzed. The genome-wide association study reached genome-wide significance on chromosome ECA 10 without the identification of a candidate gene. Several candidate genes described in previous studies on CPL (FOXC 2 (ECA 3), HET/MET (ECA 4), ubiquitin protein ligase E 3 A (ECA 1), and CD 109 (ECA 20)) were located in the proximity of regions surpassing nominal significance. All regions passing nominal significance in the genome-wide and homozygosity association analyses were subsequently analyzed using a pathway-based analysis. It suggests the involvement of several processes of the immune response and thereby supports the hypothesis that considers CPL as an inflammatory autoimmune response. It is possible that both are involved in the etiology of chronic progressive lymphedema. These results provide a first insight into the genetic background of chronic progressive lymphedema using a dense marker set. While these results were not conclusive, they do support the hypothesis of an inflammatory autoimmune response. Further research is needed to gain deeper insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying chronic progressive lymphedema and understand the involvement of both the skin elastic support system and immune response. status: accepte...|$|E
