5|$|The Dream uses a 528MHz Qualcomm MSM7201A {{system on}} a chip with 192 MB of RAM, {{and comes with}} 256 MB of <b>internal</b> <b>storage,</b> which can be {{expanded}} by up to 16 GB using a Micro SD card slot. For network connectivity, the Dream supports Quad-band GSM 850/900/1800/1900 MHz and GPRS/EDGE, plus Dual band UMTS Bands I and IV (1700 & 2100MHz) and HSDPA/HSUPA (in US/Europe) at 7.2/2 Mbit/s. The device also supports standalone GPS and A-GPS.|$|E
5|$|The new PCH-2000 {{series system}} is a lighter {{redesign}} of the device that was announced at the SCEJA Press Conference in September 2013 prior to the Tokyo Game Show. This model is 20% thinner and 15% lighter compared to the original model, has an additional hour of battery life, an LCD instead of OLED, includes a micro USB Type B port, 1GB of <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> memory. It was released in Japan on October 10, 2013 in six colors: white, black, pink, yellow, blue, and olive green, and in North America on May 6, 2014.|$|E
5|$|Though most {{computers}} since mid-2004 can boot from USB {{mass storage}} devices, USB {{is not intended}} as a primary bus for a computer's <b>internal</b> <b>storage.</b> Buses such as Parallel ATA (PATA or IDE), Serial ATA (SATA), or SCSI fulfill that role in PC class computers. However, USB has one important advantage, {{in that it is}} possible to install and remove devices without rebooting the computer (hot-swapping), making it useful for mobile peripherals, including drives of various kinds (given SATA or SCSI devices may or may not support hot-swapping).|$|E
50|$|The Pre has 8 GB of <b>internal</b> flash <b>storage</b> (approximately 7.4 GB {{of which}} is user accessible). The Pre {{does not have a}} flash memory card slot. The Pre Plus has 16 GB of <b>internal</b> flash <b>storage.</b>|$|R

5|$|To {{reduce the}} storage {{footprint}} {{of the operating}} system, Windows 10 automatically compresses system files. The system can reduce the storage footprint of Windows by approximately 1.5GB for 32-bit systems and 2.6GB for 64-bit systems. The level of compression used is dependent on a performance assessment performed during installations or by OEMs, which tests how much compression can be used without harming operating system performance. Furthermore, the Refresh and Reset functions use runtime system files instead, making a separate recovery partition redundant, allowing patches and updates to remain installed following the operation, and further {{reducing the amount of}} space required for Windows 10 by up to 12GB. These functions replace the WIMBoot mode introduced on Windows 8.1 Update, which allowed OEMs to configure low-capacity devices with flash-based storage to use Windows system files out of the compressed WIM image typically used for installation and recovery. Windows 10 also includes a function in its Settings app that allows users to view a breakdown of how their device's storage capacity is being used by different types of files, and determine whether certain types of files are saved to <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> or an SD card by default.|$|E

25|$|The 7-inch Nook Tablet, {{based on}} Android OS, with 16GB of <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> became {{available}} on November 17, 2011 for US$249. A version with 8GB of <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> was made available February 21, 2012 for US$199, replacing the Nook Color in that price range. On August 12, 2012, {{the price of}} the Nook Tablet 8GB and Nook Tablet 16GB were reduced to US$179 and US$199 respectively.|$|E
50|$|It {{is powered}} by a 1.8 GHz quad-core Intel Atom Z3560 {{processor}} with 1 GB of LPDDR3 RAM and 8 GB of <b>internal</b> eMMC <b>storage.</b>|$|R
50|$|The turret had power {{traverse}} and {{featured a}} turret basket (which limited {{the amount of}} <b>internal</b> crew <b>storage).</b> The 37 mm gun was gyroscopically stabilized.|$|R

25|$|When {{constructing}} a linked list, one {{is faced with}} the choice of whether to store the data of the list directly in the linked list nodes, called <b>internal</b> <b>storage,</b> or merely to store {{a reference to the}} data, called external storage. <b>Internal</b> <b>storage</b> has the advantage of making access to the data more efficient, requiring less storage overall, having better locality of reference, and simplifying memory management for the list (its data is allocated and deallocated {{at the same time as}} the list nodes).|$|E

25|$|Critics {{noted that}} about half of the <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> on the S4's 16GB model was taken up by its system software, using 1GB more than the S III and leaving only 8.5 to 9.15GB for the storage of other data, {{including}} downloaded apps (some of which cannot be moved to the SD card). Samsung initially stated that the space was required for the S4's new features, but following a report regarding the issue on the BBC series Watchdog, Samsung stated that it would review the possibility of optimising the S4's operating system to use less local drive space in a future update. Storage optimizations were brought in an update first released in June 2013, which frees 80MB of <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> and restores the ability to move apps to the device's microSD card.|$|E
25|$|As long as {{the number}} of {{families}} that a member can belong to is known at compile time, <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> works fine. If, however, a member needed to be included in an arbitrary number of families, with the specific number known only at run time, external storage would be necessary.|$|E
25|$|Both device {{variants}} {{also contain}} a new iteration of Apple's motion coprocessor, the M10. Unlike previous iPhone models, <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> options for iPhone 7 begin at 32GB instead of 16GB, and max out at 256GB. iPhone 7 Plus offers 3GB of RAM, {{more than any}} other previous iPhone; the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 has 2GB.|$|E
50|$|The fleet also {{consists}} of one executive Beechcraft KingAir B200 aircraft that carry 8-11 passengers each with <b>internal</b> baggage <b>storage,</b> comfortable leg room, reclining seats and full cabin pressurization.|$|R
50|$|In February 2008, {{a number}} of digital photo frames, such as the Insignia brand digital frames {{manufactured}} in China, {{were found to be}} carrying a Trojan horse dubbed Mocmex on their <b>internal</b> data <b>storage.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>internal</b> {{projectile}} <b>storage</b> contains 60 projectiles {{ready for}} automatic loading {{with the remaining}} 15 stored in other locations. The system enables the handling {{of all kinds of}} projectiles in use without any adaptation.|$|R
25|$|Semi-Subterranean {{structures}} were spaced considerably further apart. This suggests {{a decline in}} the level of genetic relatedness between structure occupants and indicates that sharing between structure occupants also declined. Storage in the deepest occupational levels of Semi-subterranean Structure 1 was composed of a single large pit in the floor. These lower occupational layers were not associated with kitchen rocks. <b>Internal</b> <b>storage</b> features were not present in later occupational levels of Semi-Subterranean Structure 1. However, kitchen rocks were used during the later occupations of Semi-Subterranean Structure 1. Rectangular Structures were spaced further apart than the pithouses, but were not spaced as far apart as Semi-Subterranean structures. No recognizable <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> features were encountered in either Rectangular Structure 1 or 2. This implies that either storage was practiced in a form that did not leave a recognizable archaeological signature, or all storage was exterior. Both of the Rectangular Structures contained kitchen rocks.|$|E
25|$|At the Archaic {{village of}} Jiskairumoko, {{it appears that}} over time genetic {{relatedness}} and sharing decreased. Storage appears to have become more centralized within structures {{and the use of}} <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> pits was eventually abandoned. About this same time the occupants of the structures began using kitchen rocks. This suggests that processing or serving activities took on greater importance within residential architecture.|$|E
25|$|External HDDs {{remained}} {{popular for}} much longer on the Apple Macintosh. Many Macintosh computers made between 1986 and 1998 featured a SCSI port on the back, making external expansion simple. Older compact Macintosh computers did not have user-accessible hard drive bays (indeed, the Macintosh 128K, Macintosh 512K, and Macintosh Plus did not feature a hard drive bay at all), so on those models external SCSI disks were the only reasonable option for expanding upon any <b>internal</b> <b>storage.</b>|$|E

30|$|There are two IO {{channels}} that the DIALIGN application running on our FPGA platform relies on. The {{first is the}} Ethernet channel for external communication, {{and the second is}} the SATA channel for <b>internal</b> deep <b>storage</b> access.|$|R
50|$|The Galaxy S II has 1 GB of {{dedicated}} RAM and 16 GB of <b>internal</b> mass <b>storage.</b> Within the battery compartment {{there is an}} external microSD card slot capable of recognizing and utilizing a 64 GB microSDXC card.|$|R
25|$|The device {{features}} a 6inches (diagonal) 4-level grayscale E Ink display, with 250MB of <b>internal</b> <b>storage,</b> which can hold approximately 200 non-illustrated titles. It {{also has a}} speaker and a headphone jack that allows the user to listen to audio files on Kindle. It is the only Kindle with expandable storage, via an SD card slot. The device's Whispernet feature was co-designed with Qualcomm, and Kindle was the first device to include free U.S.-wide 3G data access to browse and download e-books from Amazon's Kindle Store. Amazon did not sell the first generation Kindle outside the U.S.|$|E
25|$|The {{hardware}} of the second-generation {{model was}} upgraded {{in comparison to}} its predecessor, using a 2.3GHz quad-core Snapdragon 801 with 2GB of RAM, and a 5.0-inch, 1080p Super LCD 3 touchscreen display with a pixel density of 441 ppi, protected by a layer of Gorilla Glass 3 with a scratch-resistance coating. The device comes with either 16 or 32GB of <b>internal</b> <b>storage,</b> and also includes a MicroSD slot for up to 128GB of additional storage. The BoomSound stereo speakers were also improved with deeper enclosures, a larger amplifier, and an updated DSP for improved sound quality. It also incorporates a sensor hub for discrete motion tracking.|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, {{following}} {{the release of}} its new flagship, the Galaxy S5, Samsung released a refreshed version called the [...] "Galaxy S3 Neo", which has a quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor clocked either at 1.2 or 1.4GHz. [...] It has 1.5 GB of RAM and 16 GB of <b>internal</b> <b>storage</b> and ships with Android 4.4.4 [...] "KitKat".|$|E
50|$|SRBP {{insulated}} bushings {{are typically}} used up to voltages around 72.5 kV. However, above 12 kV, {{there is a}} need to control the external electrical field and to even out the <b>internal</b> energy <b>storage</b> which marginalises the dielectric strength of paper insulation.|$|R
50|$|Released in October 2012, the A110 {{includes}} 8 GB of <b>internal</b> flash <b>storage,</b> 1 GB of RAM and a 7-inch 1024×600 TFT multitouch display. Also includes in a front-facing 2 MP camera. Ships with Android 4.0 {{but can be}} {{upgraded to}} Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean).|$|R
5000|$|For many legacy CPLD devices, routing {{constrains}} most logic {{blocks to}} have {{input and output}} signals connected to external pins, reducing opportunities for <b>internal</b> state <b>storage</b> and deeply layered logic.
