5|$|Cubic {{diamonds}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> {{and easy}} octahedral cleavage, {{which means that}} they only have four planes—weak directions following the faces of the octahedron where there are fewer bonds—along which diamond can easily split upon blunt impact to leave a smooth surface. Similarly, diamond's hardness is markedly directional: the hardest direction is the diagonal on the cube face, 100 times harder than the softest direction, which is the dodecahedral plane. The octahedral plane is intermediate between the two extremes. The diamond cutting process relies heavily on this directional hardness, as without it a diamond would be nearly impossible to fashion. Cleavage also plays a helpful role, especially in large stones where the cutter wishes to remove flawed material or to produce more than one stone from the same piece of rough (e.g. Cullinan Diamond).|$|E

In the episode, SpongeBob is determined to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> day. But much to his disappointment, however, the day refuses to go at all as he planned. Each of his friends has a different problem of his/her own, so he sets out to help them while spoiling his own agendas. As soon as SpongeBob realizes that he has forfeited (and sacrificed) his perfect day to help his friends, they rally around him with their thanks and congratulations. Eventually, SpongeBob realizes {{that he has had}} his best day ever after all.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} morning hours on March 28 the Pittsburgh Penguins {{announced}} that they had acquired 16-year veteran and Calgary Flames captain Jarome Iginla in exchange for Ben Hanowski, Kenny Agostino and a 2013 first-round draft pick after Iginla also waived his no-trade clause to play for the Penguins. That evening the Penguins went on to defeat the Winnipeg Jets 4–0 which featured Evgeni Malkin making his return to the lineup after missing nine games and goaltender Tomas Vokoun recording his 50th career shutout extending the Penguins winning streak to 14 games. Jarome Iginla filled an immigration petition and was approved to join the team on March 29 in time {{to be added to the}} starting line-up against the New York Islanders. The Penguins went on to defeat the Islanders extending the winning streak to 15 games and became the first team in league history to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> record over a calendar month. The Penguins also set a franchise record for longest shutout streak of 208:24 minutes and Vokoun setting a personal and Penguins record for an individual shutout streak with 162:42 minutes. The win came with a price after 50 seconds into his first shift, Sidney Crosby left the game after a shot from Brooks Orpik was deflected and re-directed into his mouth. The next day, head coach Dan Bylsma announced that Sidney Crosby needed to have oral surgery as a result of the injury and was out indefinitely with a broken jaw. Defenseman Paul Martin also underwent surgery on a broken bone in his hand and is projected to miss 4–6 weeks.|$|E

500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com complimented the writers, who he said {{are able}} to make {{consistently}} strong episodes because they seem to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> understanding of their characters. He also said [...] "Jerry's Painting" [...] proved Ben's character has comedic potential beyond being Leslie's romantic interest. Zap2it writer Rick Porter said it was not the best of the season, but still [...] "a very solid half-hour of comedy" [...] and that [...] "the show's batting average this season is remarkably high". While Porter praised the main story, he said he found the subplot less entertaining, and did not believe April's character would have acted the way she did or lived in such filthy conditions. Not all reviews were positive. Matt Fowler of IGN said the idea of Jerry subconsciously painting Leslie and Tom was [...] "a bit too absurd", and that the episode did not feature enough of Ron Swanson. Fowler also said he did not enjoy seeing the normally positive Chris taking on an authoritarian role.|$|E

He also coached basketball at New Castle, leaving with a 319–159 record and two victories at the WPIAL championships in 1927 and 1936, and ran the track and field program.

2500|$|As we go {{from each}} pair to the next pair x increases, and so does y. This {{relationship}} is perfect, {{in the sense that}} an increase in x is always accompanied by an increase iny.
