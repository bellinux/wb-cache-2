We describe herein a 38 -yr-old woman who presented with pituitary lesion that considered to be a non-functioning pituitary lesion that was considered to be a non-functioning pituitary adenoma. Due to lack of hormonal deficits and/or compression of adjacent structures, we opted for conservation management and follow-up with consecutive magnetic resonance imaging. Fifteen months after initial diagnosis, considerable enlargement of the lesion was noted, extending mainly superiorly and indenting the potic chiasm. Repeated <b>endocrine</b> <b>investigation</b> revealed partial anterior pituitary insufficiency.

This case illustrates the effects of new-onset LYH in a patient with a pre-existing non-functioning pituatary adenoma.

Predominance of men was found (14 patients), {{especially in the}} cases with hyperthyroidism (5 patients). No thyrotoxic patient was of oriental origin. Only 4 patients had the hyperkalemic form (3 familiar, 1 sporadic). Attacks of paralysis began during the first decade in the hyperkalemic form {{and up to the}} third decade in the hypokalemic. In both forms the attacks occurred preferentially in the morning with rest after exercise being the most important precipitating factor. Seventy five percent of the hyperkalemic patients referred brief attacks (< 12 hours). Longer attacks were referred by 43 % of the hypokalemic patients. The majority of the attacks manifested with a generalized weakness mainly in legs, and its frequency was variable. Creatinokinase was evaluated in 10 patients and 8 of them had levels that varied from 1, 1 to 5 times normal. Electromyography was done in 6 patients and myotonic phenomenon was the only abnormality detected in 2 patients.

An unusual complication of Russell's viper bite envenoming in Burma (D. siamensis) and southern India (D. russelii) is hypopituitarism but until {{now it has}} not been reported elsewhere. Here, we describe the first case of hypopituitarism following Russell's viper bite in Sri Lanka, review the literature on this subject and make recommendations for <b>endocrine</b> <b>investigation</b> and management. A 49 -year-old man was bitten and seriously envenomed by D. russelii in 2005. He was treated with antivenom but although he recovered from the acute effects he remained feeling unwell. Hypopituitarism, with deficiencies of gonadal, steroid and thyroid axes, was diagnosed 3 years later. He showed marked improvement after replacement of anterior pituitary hormones. We attribute his hypopituitarism to D. russelii envenoming. Russell's viper bite is known to cause acute and chronic hypopituitarism and diabetes insipidus, perhaps through deposition of fibrin microthrombi and haemorrhage in the pituitary gland resulting from the action of venom procoagulant enzymes and haemorrhagins. Forty nine cases of hypopituitarism following Russell's viper bite have been described in the English language literature. Patients with acute hypopituitarism may present with hypoglycaemia and hypotension during the acute phase of envenoming. Those with chronic hypopituitarism seem to have recovered from envenoming but present later with features of hypopituitarism. Over 85 % of these patients had suffered acute kidney injury immediately after the bite. Steroid replacement in acute hypopituitarism is life saving. All 11 patients with chronic hypopituitarism in whom the outcome of treatment was reported, showed marked improvement with hormone replacement. Unrecognized acute hypopituitarism is potentially fatal while chronic hypopituitarism can be debilitating.

40|$|INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Adrenal myelolipomas {{are rare}} benign non {{functioning}} tumors which are mostly detected incidentally by imaging (8 - 15 %). The {{aim of this}} study was to find out the clinical outcome of 3 patients operated for incidentally discovered adrenal myelolipoma as well as to update the literature concerning this topic. PATIENTS AND METHODS: During a 24 year period (1976 - 2000) we operated on 28 of 39 (72 %) patients for incidentally discovered adrenal mass and pathology assessed 3 myelolipomas (11 %). All patients were males and average age was 54. 3 years (range 46 - 66). Myelolipoma was associated with arterial hypertension in 2 patients and BPH in 1. Patients underwent unilateral adrenalectomy. Results Myelolipomas, all unilateral, were right-sided in 2 cases (67 %) and left sided in 1. Average tumor diameter, as detected by CT scan, resulted 10. 3 cm range (3 - 17). <b>Endocrine</b> <b>investigation</b> was negative. Average tumor size, as detected by pathology, resulted 9. 3 cm (range 3 - 14) and mean weight 653 gr (range 210 - 980). Histopathology assessed primary adrenal myelolipoma in all cases. Mean follow-up is 110. 6 months (range 102 - 128) and all patients are alive and disease free. CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound (US), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are effective in diagnosing adrenal myelolipomas in about 90 % of cases. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology under CT or US control has an important role in investigating as well as diagnosing undefined masses suspected of adrenal or extraadrenal myelolipoma thus avoiding unnecessary surgery. The increasing number of incidentally discovered adrenal myelolipomas arise the question of appropriate treatment modalities which range from watchful waiting to surgical removal. Small asymptomatic tumors sized less than 4 cm can be monitored expectantly. Tumors when symptomatic or larger than 4 cm should be removed since the risk of spontaneous rupture with retroperitoneal hemorrhage and life threatening shock. Bilateral adrenalectomy for large and symptomatic tumors implies lifelong substitution with hydrocortisone. Actually, laparoscopic adrenalectomy is the new gold standard in treating myelolipomas since both showing more effective postoperative recovery than open surgery as well as reducing the number of patients who undergo long and close follow up...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This is a {{retrospective}} analysis of 25 consecutive pediatric patients with Cushing's disease who underwent transsphenoidal surgery performed by a single neurosurgeon in a specialist center during a 20 -year period. This article discusses the presentation of Cushing's disease, the endocrinological investigation with particular reference to bilateral inferior petrosal sinus sampling (BIPSS), the operative management with reference to specific pediatric difficulties of the transsphenoidal approach {{and the use of}} intraoperative image guidance, and the analysis of these cases as regards postoperative complications and outcomes of this rare condition in young patients. METHODS: All patients underwent detailed <b>endocrine</b> <b>investigation</b> and imaging in the form of computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging. BIPSS was performed in 19 patients (76 %), with successful lateralization of the side of the microadenoma in 14 (74 %) and prediction of a central tumor in four (94 % total prediction rate). Surgical removal was via the sublabial, paraseptal, transsphenoidal route. RESULTS: There were 15 male and 10 female patients, {{with a mean age of}} 13. 4 years (range, 6. 6 - 17. 8 yr). Weight gain was the most common presentation (100 %), and then growth impairment (96 %), fatigue and skin changes (64 %), and hypertension (32 %). Postoperative complications included growth hormone deficiency (36 %), transient diabetes insipidus (12 %), panhypopituitarism (4 %), and transient cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea (4 %). The median follow-up period was 59. 5 months (range, 6 - 126 mo). Overall, 15 patients (60 %) achieved surgical cure or remission, of which 14 outcomes were obtained using the results of BIPSS. Ten patients (40 %) required postoperative radiotherapy to achieve "remission. " There were no cases of meningitis, no neurological deficits, no reoperations, and no mortality. CONCLUSION: Cushing's disease in children and adolescents is a rare illness. The accurate preoperative localization of the adenoma is essential for achieving good results. In this series, BIPSS was far more accurate in localizing the adenoma than computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Imaging, however, is useful for the exclusion of other intracranial problems. Transsphenoidal surgery was safe and efficacious in achieving cure in the majority of cases. The challenge of transsphenoidal surgery in this age group is the small pituitary fossa and the absence of sphenoid sinus aeration in some cases. We found the use of intraoperative neuronavigation to be an excellent aid in overcoming such anatomic difficulties...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Huntington's disease (HD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder characterised by motor, cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. Several {{studies have demonstrated}} that hypothalamic dysfunction is part of the phenotypic spectrum. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate the growth hormone (GH) response to arginine infusion in a cohort of HD patients, to search for an in vivo biomarker of hypothalamic dysfunction. METHODS: The authors investigated 17 HD patients and 17 age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy controls. Clinical assessment of patients was performed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale motor section and total function capacity. Metabolic and <b>endocrine</b> <b>investigations</b> included total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, basal insulin, GH, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF- 1), SD Score IGF- 1 (SDS IGF- 1) and the GH response to arginine stimulation. RESULTS: HD patients showed lower plasma IGF- 1 and SDS IGF- 1 levels and a higher baseline GH in comparison with control subjects. The arginine test induced a normal GH peak in nine patients (53 %; Arg+), whereas the response was absent in the remaining eight (47 %; Arg-). Arg+ and Arg- also showed two distinct endocrine/metabolic profiles with differences in insulin and lipid metabolism. CONCLUSION: It remains to be clarified if these two subgroups of patients, according to the GH response to arginine, correspond to different disease stages or to different patterns of neurodegeneration...|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{perinatal}} history, postnatal auxological {{and clinical}} evolution and endocrine features were retrospectively evaluated in 49 children, {{adolescents and young}} adults with apparently idiopathic hypopituitarism. They were divided into two groups according to magnetic resonance images: 32 patients with isolated pituitary hypoplasia (group A) and 17 with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome (group B). The aim {{of the study was to}} assess whether these neuroradiological pictures are associated with specific endocrine and clinical patterns. No significant difference in terms of gestational age, intrauterine growth and rates of adverse perinatal events was found between the two groups. Clinical signs documenting the existence of pituitary dysfunction in utero or shortly after birth were either slightly (micropenis, cryptorchidism, cholestatic jaundice) or significantly (hypoglycemia) more frequent in patients in group B. Although diagnosis of hypopituitarism was made significantly earlier in patients in group B, height deficiency at diagnosis was similar in both groups. <b>Endocrine</b> <b>investigations</b> revealed a more severe and widespread impairment of pituitary function among those in group B. The main conclusion is that the postnatal clinical course is more severe when growth hormone deficiency is associated with pituitary stalk interruption syndrome than when the pituitary is only reduced in height, probably because of the more severe and widespread impairment of pituitary function in the former cases.

The transgenic zebrafish embryos were also considered to be experimental models compatible with EDA, and their integration in future studies is expected to be facilitated by automated image analysis procedures [52].|$|R
40|$|Adrenal incidentalomas {{detected}} {{during pregnancy}} are very rare, {{and the natural}} history of these tumors during gestation is unknown. We report a case of a pregnant woman with an adrenal mass discovered serendipitously, who was followed-up during gestation and underwent adrenalectomy shortly after delivery. This allowed the evaluation of both the clinical outcome and the molecular/immunohistochemical correlates. Estrogens may indeed influence the function and proliferation of human adrenal cells, and a state of circulating estrogen excess can represent an in vivo model to test their effect on the adrenals. No evidence of adrenal change in morphology and function was found in our patient throughout pregnancy, as shown by adrenal ultrasound imaging and adrenal hormone measurements. Four months after delivery, the patient underwent laparoscopic right adrenalectomy, and pathologic analysis revealed a 2. 7 cm benign adrenocortical adenoma. The diameter of the adrenal mass at ultrasonography correlated highly with post-partum mass diameter measured by abdominal computed tomography (CT). Quantitative expression of both ERalpha and ERbeta by real-time RT-PCR analysis and Western blotting findings did not differ among adenoma, normal adjacent adrenal and normal adrenal control tissues. This case of an adrenal incidentaloma discovered during pregnancy shows that a close observation with <b>endocrine</b> <b>investigations</b> and ultrasonography could be an appropriate approach, delaying the decision of surgical intervention after delivery. Estrogen receptor mRNA levels in the adrenal mass similar to those observed in normal adrenals suggest that estrogen oversecretion during pregnancy was not a risk factor for tumor progression...|$|R
