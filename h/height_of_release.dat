The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the repeatability and linearity of a taekwondo EBP. A commercially available EBP that registers the energy (E) of a hit in Joules was placed unfolded on a hard non-deformable surface. Ten potential "hit" areas were marked on the EBP's surface. To simulate kicking conditions a 4 kg iron shot attached to a switch operated electromagnet was systematically released against the EBP from three randomly selected heights (1. 78 m, 1. 92 m, and 2. 00 m). The shot was released 5 times repeatedly from each <b>height</b> on each <b>of</b> the 10 areas. The procedure was repeated after a 30 min interval. Reliability was assessed by the test-retest method using Chronbach's alpha, Guttman split half and ICC, and the coefficient of variation (%CV). The overall (10 sites pooled together) CV was 4. 8 %. Τhe CV’s for the three <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> were 5. 47 %, 4. 77 %, and 4. 18 %, respectively.

40|$|Dispersion {{capacity}} of alien invasive plants {{is a key}} feature for understanding invasion processes and risks. Here, we present an experimental study focussing on the seed rain pattern of Senecio inaequidens, an African plant widespread throughout Europe, under common favourable dispersal conditions. One hundred achenes from two Belgian populations underwent a drop time in still air experiment {{in order to assess}} linear correlation between several morphological traits and terminal velocity. Variation in morphological traits was measured for 250 additional achenes per population. The trait best correlated to terminal velocity was the square root of the plume loading. We then used this trait to model terminal velocity using a linear regression (r(2) of 79. 7 %). With this regression and imposing ecological parameters such as wind speed, turbulences and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> to be representative of favourable dispersal conditions, we established a Gaussian tilted plume model to predict the seed rain pattern of the species.

40|$|Abstract: - There {{are several}} types of events {{that could result in}} {{dispersion}} of radioactive substances in the environment. These include both intentional and unintentional events. The extent of the contamination and impact on the environment and people depend greatly on the specific event and the radionuclide involved. In recent years, the concern for protection of urban populations against terrorist attacks involving radiological substances has attracted increasing attention. Models and computational codes have been developed and hypothetical scenarios have been formulated for establishing priority of countermeasures and protective actions; determining of generic operational guidelines; and assessment of risks for exposure population. The aim of the presents study is to illustrate the resultant effects of intentional release of Cs- 137 from stacks of cement production industry. This is done through simulation of different scenarios using a computer code named HotSpot. The Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE), which includes external and internal contributions for the whole absorbed dose, has been calculated for various atmospheric stability Pasquill categories [1]. The meteorological data on atmospheric stability conditions are setting as “mean wind speed” and the results have been analyzed and are presented here. The results indicate that atmospheric dispersion of a relatively small amount of Cs- 137 has the potential to contaminate a relatively large area with the extent of contamination (area and activity) firstly dependent on Cs- 137 particle size, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>release,</b> and local weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Depleted uranium is a {{low-cost}} radioactive material that, {{in addition to}} other applications, is used by the military in kinetic energy weapons against armored vehicles. During the Gulf and Balkan conflicts concern has been raised about the potential health hazards arising from the toxic and radioactive material released. The aerosol produced during impact and combustion of depleted uranium munitions can potentially contaminate wide areas around the impact sites or can be inhaled by civilians and military personnel. Attempts to esti-mate the extent and magnitude of the dispersion were until now performed by complex modeling tools employing unclear assumptions and input parameters of high uncertainty. An analytical puff model accommodating diffusion with simulta-neous deposition is developed, which can provide a reasonable estimation of the dispersion of the released depleted uranium aerosol. Furthermore, the period of the exposure for a given point downwind from the release can be estimated (as opposed to when using a plume model). The main result is that the depleted uranium mass is deposited very close to the release point. The deposition flux at a couple of kilometers from the release point is more than one order of magnitude lower than the one a few meters near the release point. The effects due to uncertainties in the key input variables are addressed. The most influential parameters are found to be atmospheric stability, <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>release,</b> and wind speed, whereas aerosol size distribution is less significant. The output from the analytical model developed was tested against the numerical model RPM-AERO. Results display satisfactory agreement between the two models...|$|E
40|$|With {{widespread}} use of pesticides in modern agriculture, the impacts of spray drift have become a topic of considerable interest. The drifting of sprays is a highly complex process influenced by many factors. Advances in aerial application technology and {{in our ability to}} measure drift, coupled with the adoption of new technologies for regulating pesticide application have necessitated further research in the pesticide application process. Experiments were conducted to quantify spray drift and describe its movement from aerial applications of pesticide. The effects of spray quality, atomizer type and ground cover were examined. Initial airborne drift amounts were greater than downwind deposits, thus not all of the drifting spray was deposited in the measuring area. Total off-target movement of spray was significantly greater for Fine compared to Coarse sprays. Rotary and hydraulic atomizers, both producing Fine sprays, produced statistically similar off-target movement of sprays. Similarly, no significant statistical differences in spray drift between applications to bare ground and applications to a headed barley crop canopy were not identified. Contrary to expectations, aerial application to bare ground seemed to result in less off-target movement than application to a crop canopy. The vertical spray cloud profiles were similar for all applications with the greatest amount of spray present at the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>release.</b> Spray concentrations diminished from that height upward with diffusion and downward with deposition. The empirical data disagreed with the mechanistic model AgDISP which is currently used in the Canadian regulatory process. The model over-predicted drift deposition by a factor of two to five. Variability in spray deposit values could not be attributed to average differences in meteorological conditions at the time of application. Experiments with appropriate protocols for increased sensitivity may be required to more accurately report subtle differences in drift at distances greater than 200 m from the target area...|$|E
40|$|Several {{waters in}} the {{management}} area of waterboard “Hoogheemraadschap De Stichtse Rijnlanden” should meet the requirements for the Water Framework Directive but do not fulfil due to high phosphorus concentrations in the water column. These phosphorus concentrations {{were expected to be}} (partly) caused by high phosphorus release rates from the stream bed sediment to the water column, especially in non-urban ditches. Hence, phosphorus release rates were quantified in 57 non-urban ditches, divided over 11 sub-areas. This quantification was based on prior observed correlations <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>release</b> rates with interstitial phosphorus, the interstitial iron:phosphorus ratio and the sediment iron:sulphur ratio. Also relations <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>release</b> with soil type, land use type, seepage/infiltration rate, nature management and chemical and non-chemical characteristics of the ditches were studied for more insight on phosphorus release (and mechanism behind it) and to define rules of thumbs about phosphorus release. These rules were based on easy determinable ditch characteristics (relative to interstitial phosphorus, interstitial iron:phosphorus and sediment iron:sulphur) and aimed to easily indicate ditches where phosphorus release is probably high or low. Mean phosphorus release rates in the sub-areas vary between 0. 0 and 2. 0 mg P/m 2 /day and the high release rates in some sub-areas might indeed explain high phosphorus concentrations in the water column. Phosphorus release largely differs per soil type; the release is highest in peat areas and lowest in (sabulous) clay areas. Phosphorus release also seems to differ per land use and be lower by fruit cultivation than by crops/grasslands. However, this was not statistically verified. No effect of infiltration is found. Results, however, revealed that iron-rich seepage leads to lower release rates. Also nature management (e. g. decline of fertilizer use) can lead to lower phosphorus release rates. Phosphorus release correlates with variables that indicate organic decomposition, which emphasizes the important role of organic decomposition for phosphorus release. Furthermore, most locations with highly organic stream bed sediment also had low sediment phosphorus binding capacity, partly due to low iron concentrations. The “Rules of thumbs” form a tool that can easily indicate the possibility <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>release</b> but not the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>release.</b> At locations with a possibility <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>release,</b> determined with this tool, water managers could decide to measure interstitial phosphorus concentrations to quantify the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> phosphorus <b>release...</b>|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 46 - 48) Three factors, {{in order}} of importance, determine how far a shot will travel: velocity of release, angle of release, and <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>release.</b> It is agreed upon that <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> and angle of release are primarily constant among elite level shot putters. However, the velocity of release can be improved through resistance training and throwing multiple weight implements. Eight elite shot put coaches were surveyed on the resistance training methods they assign to their athletes. The survey asked questions about specific lifts that are used, specific structure of lifting throughout the year, and throwing multiple weighted implements. This quantitative and qualitative study investigated eight of the country's best shot put coaches to determine their philosophies on resistance training {{for the improvement of}} performance in the shot put. It was consistent among the coaches surveyed that they use forms of resistance training in their training plans. However, the philosophies on how to employ these methods varied among each coach. All coaches use a combination of Olympic lifts, power lifts, ancillary lifts, and core exercises in training. A majority of the coaches reported that the Olympic lifts are the most important lifts for success in the shot put and scheduled Olympic lifts before power lifts when performed on the same day. Most coaches reported emphasizing speed of movement on the power lifts, and two of the coaches felt that bench press was the lift that enabled you to have the most success in the shot put. All coaches reported using a variety of ancillary lifts for various reasons. However, a common theme for using these types of lifts was to improve performance of the primary Olympic and power lifts. Other reasons included injury prevention and building mass. The coaches also reported using a variety of core exercises the most common involving movement through multiple planes. All but one coach reported lifting on the same day they throw. All coaches used a structure to set up their lifting throughout the year. However, the way each coach structured training varied. The number of phases in the yearly program ranged from three to seven. Furthermore, the frequency of resistance training varied from two to five days per week. Each coach made similar adjustments according to important competitions throughout the year, dropping volume before an important competition. However, each coach differed in relation to their philosophies on intensity. All coaches surveyed reported making adjustments to their plans throughout the year, although, two of the coaches reported that 90 % of their training programs are constant and only make adjustments due to injury or illness. Three coaches reported assigning the same workouts to their male and female athletes, while four coaches reported that they are different. The most common difference among the workouts is that females are assigned more upper body training and higher volume. All coaches reported throwing multiple weighted implements as a method for training. However, the way this method was used differed among the coaches. Most coaches used a combination of light, heavy, and the competition implement and do not adjust weight room volume and intensity based on the types of implements being thrown during training sessions. Finally, five coaches reported that their coaching theories are based on scientific research. The three remaining coaches reported using trial and error and personal experience to develop their theories. It is hoped that the information obtained from this survey will assist less experienced coaches when evaluating their resistance training programs and aid in determining what can be added or taken away from current training protocols used with their athletes...|$|E
40|$|There {{are several}} types of events {{that could result in}} {{dispersion}} of radioactive substances in the environment. The dispersion can be a consequence of a natural or intentional event. In case of radiological release the estimation of the contaminated area is very important to properly manage the rescue operations and decontamination by evaluating the impact on the population and environment. The extent of the contamination and impact on the environment and people mainly depends on the specific event and the radionuclide involved. Models and computational codes have been developed and hypothetical scenarios have been formulated for establishing priority of countermeasures and protective actions, determining generic operational guidelines and assessment of risks for population exposure. The aim of the present study is to illustrate the effects of two different cases of intentional release. Due to the lack of available real data, this is carried out through simulation of different scenarios by using a computer code named HotSpot; in fact literature data referring to real events of this kind are classified and cannot be disseminated. The first case consists in the release of Cs- 137 from stacks of cement production industry, the second in the release of Strontium 90 from the explosion of a dirty bomb. The Total Effective Dose Equivalent (TEDE), which includes external and internal contributions for the whole absorbed dose, and the contaminant Ground Deposition have been calculated for various atmospheric stability Pasquill categories [1], several distributions of contaminant particle size, different explosive quantity (dirty bomb case). Results have been analyzed and presented here. They indicate that atmospheric dispersion of a relatively small amount of Cs- 137 has the potential to contaminate a relatively large area, while the explosion of a dirty bomb containing a large amount of a strontium 90, does not represent a problem in terms of direct contamination. In both cases the extent of contamination (area and activity) mainly depends on: particle size; the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> and local weather conditions...|$|E
40|$|Tall {{players are}} thought to have an {{advantage}} when shooting in netball. The {{purpose of the study was}} to analyse the effect of stature on netball shooting kinematics, with and without, the presence of a defender. With institutional ethical approval, 10 female elite netball shooters were recruited as participants. There was a significant difference (t¼ 73. 598, P¼ 0. 004) between the height of the five tallest shooters, (mean 174. 8, s¼ 3. 70 m), and the five shortest (mean 164. 2, s¼ 5. 45 m). Six successful shots by each participant from a distance of 2 m from the goal post, three with, and three without the presence of a defender, were videoed by a high definition video camera, positioned at right angles to the plane of motion. The defender was positioned 0. 9 m from the subject. A kinematic analysis was undertaken and the data were transferred to SPSS 15 for analysis. The shorter shooters were found to release the ball at a greater velocity both with (t¼ 2. 103, P¼ 0. 03), and without (t¼ 2. 097, P¼ 0. 03,) the presence of a defender. There was no difference in <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>release</b> between the two groups in the presence of a defender (P 40. 05), but the shorter participants released the ball at a significantly lower height when undefended, (P 50. 05). There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the angle of release with, or without, the presence of a defender (P 40. 05). There was no significant difference in the horizontal linear displacement of the ball during the ‘‘throwing phase’’ between the groups with, or without the presence of defenders (P 40. 05). There was no significant differences between the groups in terms of knee angle without a defender at any key positions (P 40. 05), although in the presence of a defender the shorter shooters bent their knees significantly more (P 50. 05) at the start of the throwing phase. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of elbow or wrist angle at any key position, with or without, the presence of a defender, (P 40. 05). These results suggest that stature is not a critical factor when selecting elite netball shooters, as successful shorter shooters compensate for their lack of height by changes in kinematics...|$|E

The impact of these heavy gases (high molecular weight than air) in the surrounding atmosphere is very harmful / hazardous to the human health because the formation of heavy clouds of the respective gases nears the earth surface. In present paper, considered the effect of atmospheric parameter such as, direction of air, wind speed etc. as well as stack parameter like <b>height</b> <b>of</b> stack and <b>released</b> gas parameter as density, venting speed of the gas on the dispersion of heavy gas in to the surrounding.

At {{the end of the}} year they issed their first release for Zebra, the 12" [...] EP We Got the Edge. This was {{followed}} by what was considered a radically different sounding second album, Hyperactive, which although gaining great reviews, the band were unable to capitalise on due to a lack of support from management or record company. Finally the band disbanded in 1986, resurfacing in 1995 at the request of fans during the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> Grunge <b>releasing</b> their third album Holy Wars, once again to critical acclaim. Albums followed in 1998, Babylon, and 2001, Xtreme Machine. A protracted hiatus then followed, fuelled by significant personal and family issues that were impacting all members of the band. The band resurfaced in 2011 with a new album Sons of Malice, again receiving significant critical acclaim with founding and driving members Chris Bradley and Andy Dawson, joined by Kris Bradley (Chris's son and Andys nephew) on guitar and Mark Nelson on drums. The band have returned to the festival circuit and are currently writing the follow-up album to Sons of Malice for a planned release in 2014 as part of a double album that will feature the entire Loose 'n' Lethal album recorded live.|$|R
