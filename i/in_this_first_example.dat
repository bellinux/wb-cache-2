40|$|Abstract. A {{context-free}} grammar G is ambiguous {{if there is}} a word that can be generated by G with at least two different derivation trees. Ambiguous grammars are often distinguished by their degree of ambiguity, which is the maximal number of derivation trees for the words generated by them. If there is no such upper bound G is said to be ambiguous of infinite degree. By considering how many derivation trees a word of at most length n may have, we can distinguish {{context-free grammar}}s with infinite degree of ambiguity by the growth-rate of their ambiguity with respect to the length of the words. It is known that each cycle-free context-free grammar G is either exponentially ambiguous or its ambiguity is bounded by a polynomial.

40|$|Kindlins are a novel {{family of}} {{intracellular}} adaptor proteins in integrin-containing focal adhesions. Kindlin- 1 and - 2 {{are expressed in}} the skin, but whether and how they cooperate in adult epithelial cells have remained elusive. We uncovered the overlapping roles of kindlin- 1 and - 2 in maintaining epithelial integrity and show that the phenotype of kindlin- 1 -deficient cells can be modulated by regulating kindlin- 2 gene expression and vice versa. The experimental evidence is provided by use of human keratinocyte cell lines that express both kindlins, just kindlin- 1 or kindlin- 2, or none of them. Double deficiency of kindlin- 1 and - 2 had significant negative effects on focal adhesion formation and actin cytoskeleton organization, cell adhesion, survival, directional migration, and activation of β 1 integrin, whereas deficiency of one kindlin only showed variable perturbation of these functions. Cell motility and formation of cell-cell contacts were particularly affected by lack of kindlin- 2. These results predict that kindlin- 1 and - 2 can functionally compensate for each other, at least in part. The high physiologic and pathologic significance of the compensation was emphasized by the discovery of environmental regulation of kindlin- 2 expression.

40|$|Theories of {{uncertainty}} {{are applied to}} a large range of fields, {{and they have a}} special interest on engineering, because of safety and risk concerns related to human lives. This concern is very high on aerospace applications, where safety is truly the most critical requirement.

Safety factors are applied on all scales from simple components to more complex systems. Within this paper, inherent variabilities are expressed through statistical distributions, which is an alternative approach to traditional safety factors. Structures are interpreted as systems whose reliability level should be assessed.

In another approach for this application, a specific readout method is proposed, allowing optimization of the integration time independently of the full frame-readout time. The circuit consists of an in-pixel front-end voltage amplifier, with a gain on the order of five, followed by two analog memory cells. The extended version of this scheme, based on the implementation of more memory cells per pixel, is the solution considered for the outer layers of a microvertex detector at the international linear collider. For the two innermost layers, a circuit allowing fast frame scans together with on-line, on-chip data sparsification is proposed. The <b>first</b> results of <b>this</b> prototype demonstrate that the fixed pattern dispersion is reduced below a noise level of 15 e−, allowing the use of a single comparator or a low-resolution ADC per pixel column. A common element for most of the mentioned readout schemes is a low-noise, low power consumption, layout efficient in-pixel amplifier. A review of possible solutions for this element together with some experimental results is presented...|$|R
40|$|We present {{multiple}} {{factor analysis}} for contingency tables (MFACT) and its implementation in the FactoMineR package. This method, through an option of the MFA function, allows us to deal with multiple contingency or frequency tables, {{in addition to the}} categorical and quantitative multiple tables already considered in previous versions of the package. Thanks to this revised function, either a multiple contingency table or a mixed multiple table integrating quantitative, categorical and frequency data can be tackled. The FactoMineR package (Lê et al., 2008; Husson et al., 2011) offers the most commonly used principal component methods: principal component analysis (PCA), correspondence analysis (CA; Benzécri, 1973), multiple correspondence analysis (MCA; Lebart et al., 2006) and {{multiple factor analysis}} (MFA; Escofier and Pagès, 2008). Detailed presentations of these methods enriched by numerous examples can be consulted at the website [URL] An extension of the MFA function that considers contingency or frequency tables as proposed by Bécue-Bertaut and Pagès (2004, 2008) is detailed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> article. <b>First,</b> an <b>example</b> is presented in order to motivate the approach. Next, the mortality data used to illustrate the method are introduced. Then we briefly describe multiple factor analysis (MFA) and present the principles of its extension to contingency tables. A real example on mortality data illustrates the handling of the MFA function to analyse these multiple tables and, finally, conclusions are presented.

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> study two timber bridges are analyzed, which {{constitute}} {{examples of}} structures with arch behaviour obtained assembling straight elements of reduced dimensions: Traian’s bridge on Danube River {{and the military}} bridge drawn by Leonard from Vinci. For each one, starting from available surveys in literature, a structural definition based upon an accurate interpretation of the behaviour of connections between the straight elements, needed for arch configuration, has been made. Leonard’s military bridge shows an arch configured by rectilinear rods, disposed on staggered planes, jointed by lashings. The exam of some papers in the Atlantic Code, relating to this bridge and to studies on details of connections made by lashings, has allowed {{the recognition of the}} military bridge joints as an application of the mechanism used by roman carpenters in building Caesar’s Bridge on Rhine River, following the interpretation given by Palladio. Joint’s behaviour schematization, introduced in a proper numerical modelling, has allowed verifying the real arch behaviour of the structure drawn by Leonard. For Traian’s Bridge, a new hypothesis on structure design has been proposed, different from those existing in literature, but more appropriate for technological level of its building times; the given interpretation recognizes <b>in</b> <b>this</b> work the <b>first</b> <b>example</b> of a bridge with an underlying polygonal centring. An experimental study on scale models has allowed introducing in the numerical modelling different degrees of stiffness of the joints between straight elements making the arch and double hanging posts. From numerical results the need of spacing transversal joists comes out at the aim of induce an equilibrated distribution of normal stresses between the three polygonal profiles of the arch structure...|$|R
