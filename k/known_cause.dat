5|$|The Bible {{may contain}} an early account of rhabdomyolysis. In , the Pentateuch {{says that the}} Jews demanded meat while {{traveling}} in the desert; God sent quail {{in response to the}} complaints, and people ate large quantities of quail meat. A plague then broke out, killing numerous people. Rhabdomyolysis after consuming quail was described in more recent times and called coturnism (after Coturnix, the main quail genus). Migrating quail consume large amounts of hemlock, a <b>known</b> <b>cause</b> of rhabdomyolysis.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a further}} {{five or six}} species/types and {{varieties}} of elephant gammaherpesvirus (EGHVs) found in eye and genital secretions of many healthy Asian and African zoo elephants - e.g. EGHV1, EGHV2, EGHV3A, EGHV3B, EGHV4 and EGHV5 (also called Elephantid herpesviruses EIHV3, EIHV4, EIHV5, EIHV6, ElHV9 and ElHV10 - which are gamma herpesviruses. But these are neither {{closely related to the}} EEHVs, nor the <b>known</b> <b>cause</b> of any disease symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} may {{be categorized}} {{according to whether}} they have environmental or developmental causes. While environmental abnormalities may appear to have an obvious cause, there may {{not appear to be}} any <b>known</b> <b>cause</b> for some developmental abnormalities. Environmental forces may affect teeth during development, destroy tooth structure after development, discolor teeth at any stage of development, or alter the course of tooth eruption. Developmental abnormalities most commonly affect the number, size, shape, and structure of teeth.|$|E

5|$|AIDS {{was first}} {{clinically}} observed in 1981 in the United States. The initial cases were {{a cluster of}} injection drug users and gay men with no <b>known</b> <b>cause</b> of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems. Soon thereafter, additional gay men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged, alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak. The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS {{is believed to have}} been in Norway beginning in 1966.|$|E

25|$|Within {{nine years}} of the Washington discovery, animal studies, {{including}} non-human monkey studies carried out at the University of Washington Primate Center by Dr. Sterling Clarren, had confirmed that alcohol was a teratogen.

25|$|Tremor {{can also}} be caused from lack of sleep, lack of vitamins, or {{increased}} stress. Deficiencies of magnesium and thiamine have also been known to cause tremor or shaking, which resolves when the deficiency is corrected. See magnesium in biology. Some forms of tremor are inherited and run in families, while others have no <b>known</b> <b>cause.</b> Tremors {{can also be}} caused by some spider bites, e.g. the redback spider of Australia.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors such}} as toxicants can {{adversely}} impact bone cells. Infections, chronic or acute, can affect blood flow by inducing platelet activation and aggregation, contributing to a localized state of excess coagulability (hypercoagulability) that may contribute to clot formation (thrombosis), a <b>known</b> <b>cause</b> of bone infarct and ischaemia. Exogenous estrogens, also called hormonal disruptors, have been linked with an increased tendency to clot (thrombophilia) and impaired bone healing.|$|E
25|$|Essential {{myoclonus}} {{occurs in}} the absence of epilepsy or other apparent abnormalities in the brain or nerves. It can occur randomly in people with no family history, or among members of the same family, indicating that it sometimes may be an inherited disorder. Essential myoclonus tends to be stable without increasing in severity over time. Some scientists speculate that some forms of essential myoclonus may be a type of epilepsy with no <b>known</b> <b>cause.</b>|$|E

Yapıcıoğlu then ran after an eyewitness, caught him and killed him by cutting his throat.|$|E
25|$|The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) {{estimates}} that each year 2.4 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution could be avoided. Particularly hazardous for health are emissions of black carbon, {{a component of}} particulate matter, which is a <b>known</b> <b>cause</b> of respiratory and carcinogenic diseases and a significant contributor to global climate change. The links between greenhouse gas emissions and particulate matter make low carbon transport an increasingly sustainable investment at local level—both by reducing emission levels and thus mitigating climate change; and by improving public health through better air quality.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, American {{biochemist}} Harry Steenbock at the University of Wisconsin {{demonstrated that}} irradiation by ultraviolet light increased the vitamin D content of foods and other organic materials. After irradiating rodent food, Steenbock discovered the rodents were cured of rickets. A vitamin D deficiency is a <b>known</b> <b>cause</b> of rickets. Using $300 {{of his own}} money, Steenbock patented his invention. His irradiation technique was used for foodstuffs, most memorably for milk. By the expiration of his patent in 1945, rickets had been all but eliminated in the US.|$|E

40|$|The {{reports of}} the state fire marshal of Iowa for the years 1912 - 1916 show that {{spontaneous}} combustion, or the overheating of a substance from causes within itself, is a very prominent cause of fires in the state.

50|$|This {{condition}} {{has several}} <b>known</b> <b>causes,</b> dietary and genetic. Dietary causes include the chronic excessive ingestion of licorice. Licorice inhibits the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type II (Protein:HSD11B2) enzyme resulting in inappropriate {{stimulation of the}} mineralocorticoid receptor by cortisol.|$|R
25|$|Definite loss: The loss {{takes place}} at a known time, in a known place, and from a <b>known</b> <b>cause.</b> The classic example is death of an insured person on a life {{insurance}} policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.|$|E
25|$|Diseases {{that affect}} the large {{intestine}} may affect it {{in whole or in}} part. Appendicitis is one such disease, caused by inflammation of the appendix. Generalised inflammation of the large intestine is referred to as colitis, which when caused be the bacteria Clostridium difficile is referred to as pseudomembranous colitis. Diverticulitis is a common cause of abdominal pain resulting from outpouchings that particularly affects the colon. Functional colonic diseases refer to disorders without a <b>known</b> <b>cause,</b> and include irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal pseudoobstruction. Constipation may result from lifestyle factors, impaction of a rigid stool in the rectum, or in neonates, Hirschprung's disease.|$|E
25|$|Fetal alcohol {{syndrome}} or FAS is a {{birth defect}} {{that occurs in}} the offspring of women who drink alcohol during pregnancy. Drinking heavily or {{during the early stages}} of prenatal development has been conclusively linked to FAS; moderate consumption is associated with fetal damage. Alcohol crosses the placental barrier and can stunt fetal growth or weight, create distinctive facial stigmata, damaged neurons and brain structures, and cause other physical, mental, or behavioural problems. Fetal alcohol exposure is the leading <b>known</b> <b>cause</b> of intellectual disability in the Western world. Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with brain insulin and insulin-like growth factor resistance.|$|E
