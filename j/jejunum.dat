5|$|During a Whipple's procedure, {{commonly}} used to treat pancreatic cancer by removing the pancreas, duodenum, {{and part of the}} <b>jejunum,</b> the ligament of Treitz is separated from the duodenum and preserved. When the remaining <b>jejunum</b> is anastamosed with the pylorus of the stomach, it may be passed through the ligament.|$|E
5|$|The {{duodenum}} and the <b>jejunum</b> are {{the first}} and second parts of the small intestine, respectively. The suspensory muscle of the duodenum marks their formal division. The suspensory muscle arises from the right crus of the diaphragm as it passes around the esophagus, continues as connective tissue around the stems of the celiac trunk (celiac artery) and superior mesenteric artery, passes behind the pancreas, and enters {{the upper part of the}} mesentery, inserting into the junction between the duodenum and <b>jejunum,</b> the duodenojejunal flexure. Here, the muscles are continuous with the muscular layers of the duodenum.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle {{marks the}} formal {{division between the}} first and second parts of the small intestine, the duodenum and the <b>jejunum.</b> This division is used to mark the difference between the upper and lower gastrointestinal tracts, which is relevant in clinical medicine as it may determine the source of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E
5|$|The {{suspensory}} muscle of duodenum {{is a thin}} muscle {{connecting the}} junction between the duodenum, <b>jejunum,</b> and duodenojejunal flexure to connective tissue surrounding the superior mesenteric artery and coeliac artery. It {{is also known as}} the ligament of Treitz. The suspensory muscle most often connects to both the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, as well as the duodenojejunal flexure, although the attachment is quite variable.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats fed the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the <b>jejunum</b> was greater on rats fed the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats fed the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats fed the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E
25|$|Special {{coatings}} {{can make}} the tablet resistant to the stomach acids such that it only disintegrates in the duodenum, <b>jejunum</b> and colon {{as a result of}} enzyme action or alkaline pH.|$|E
25|$|Ileum: The {{final section}} of the small intestine. It is about 3 m long, and {{contains}} villi similar to the <b>jejunum.</b> It absorbs mainly vitamin B12 and bile acids, {{as well as any}} other remaining nutrients.|$|E
25|$|One {{effect of}} {{campylobacteriosis}} is tissue {{injury in the}} gut. The sites of tissue injury include the <b>jejunum,</b> the ileum, and the colon. C jejuni appears to achieve this by invading and destroying epithelial cells.|$|E
25|$|Enteroclysis {{also called}} small bowel enema is a Barium X-ray {{examination}} used to display individual loops {{of the small}} intestine by intubating the <b>jejunum</b> with a small tube and administering Barium sulfate followed by methylcellulose or air.|$|E
25|$|The small {{intestine}} {{consists of the}} duodenum, <b>jejunum</b> and ileum. Inflammation of the {{small intestine}} is called enteritis, which if localised to just part is called duodenitis, jejunitis and ileitis, respectively. Peptic ulcers are also common in the duodenum.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspensory}} {{muscle is}} an important anatomical landmark which shows the formal division between the duodenum and the <b>jejunum,</b> {{the first and second}} parts of the small intestine, respectively. This is a thin muscle which is derived from the embryonic mesoderm.|$|E
25|$|STb is an {{enterotoxin}} type B that is heat stable; additionally, it is secreted by the enterotoxigenic E. coli strain, and {{it causes}} diarrheal diseases in humans {{and many other}} species of animals. STb also binds strongly to sulfatide as demonstrated by its binding to sulfatide present on the mucosal surface of a pig’s <b>jejunum.</b> Additional experimentation suggests that sulfatide is a functional STb receptor.|$|E
25|$|Foreign body is {{an object}} {{foreign to the}} body that becomes lodged in the {{gastrointestinal}} tract (or {{other part of the}} dog). Dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due to their ability to swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the esophagus. Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the stomach because of the inability to pass through the pyloric sphincter, and in the <b>jejunum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Proximal enteritis, {{also known}} as {{anterior}} enteritis or duodenitis-proximal jejunitis (DPJ), is inflammation of the duodenum and upper <b>jejunum.</b> It is potentially caused by infectious organisms, such as Salmonella and Clostridial species, but other possible contributing factors include Fusarium infection or high concentrate diets. The inflammation of the intestine leads to large secretions of electrolytes and fluid into its lumen, and thus large amounts of gastric reflux, leading to dehydration and occasionally shock.|$|E
25|$|The {{diagnosis}} of bacterial overgrowth {{is made by}} a number of techniques, with the gold standard being an aspirate from the <b>jejunum</b> that grows in excess of 105 bacteria per millilitre. Risk factors for the development of bacterial overgrowth include dysmotility; anatomical disturbances in the bowel, including fistulae, diverticula and blind loops created after surgery, and resection of the ileo-cecal valve; gastroenteritis-induced alterations to the small intestine; and the use of certain medications, including proton pump inhibitors.|$|E
25|$|When food {{containing}} fat {{enters the}} digestive tract, it stimulates the secretion of cholecystokinin (CCK) from I {{cells of the}} duodenum and <b>jejunum.</b> In response to cholecystokinin, the gallbladder rhythmically contracts and releases its contents into the common bile duct, eventually draining into the duodenum. The bile emulsifies fats in partly digested food, thereby assisting their absorption. Bile consists primarily of water and bile salts, and also acts {{as a means of}} eliminating bilirubin, a product of hemoglobin metabolism, from the body.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{gastrointestinal}} tract includes {{most of the}} small intestine {{and all of the}} large intestine. In human anatomy, the intestine (bowel, or gut) is the segment of the {{gastrointestinal tract}} extending from the pyloric sphincter of the stomach to the anus and, in humans and other mammals, consists of two segments, the small intestine and the large intestine. In humans, the small intestine is further subdivided into the duodenum, <b>jejunum</b> and ileum while the large intestine is subdivided into the cecum, colon, rectum, and anal canal.|$|E
25|$|Defined as the sodium-dependent proline {{transporter}} not inhibited by alanine, system IMINO, {{believed to}} be formed by the SLC6A20 (SIT1) gene, is a crucial mammalian transport mechanism responsible for both renal reabsorption and intestinal absorption of proline and other imino acids, such as hydroxyproline and pipecolate. The mRNA sequence for SIT1 is expressed in {{a great deal of}} the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, duodenum, <b>jejunum,</b> ileum, cecum and colon. It is also found in the kidney, optical choroid, and parts of the central nervous system such the brain and microglial cells.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} pharmacological {{studies on}} candicine (under {{the name of}} hordenine methiodide) appear to be those of Barger and Dale, who studied its effects primarily in cats and isolated animal organ preparations. These researchers found candicine to closely resemble nicotine in its effects. For example, contractions of isolated sections of rabbit <b>jejunum</b> were produced by ~ 2 × 10−5M concentrations of the drug; 1mg of candicine iodide given i.v. to cats produced the same rise in blood pressure as 0.5mg nicotine; toxic doses produced respiratory paralysis. It was observed that in the same blood pressure assay, candicine iodide was about twice as potent as its structural analog tyramine, and much more potent than its even-closer analog, hordenine.|$|E
25|$|Just {{behind the}} presumed {{position}} of the stomach a very conspicuous large and thick intestine is visible, that {{has been identified as}} the duodenum. It is preserved partly {{in the form of a}} natural endocast, partly as a petrification still showing the cellular structure, including the mucosa and connective tissue. Some mesenteric blood vessels cover the intestine in the form of up to a centimetre long and 0.02 to 0.1 millimetre wide hollow tubes. The duodenum forms a large loop, the descending part of which first is directed downwards towards the gastralia and then runs to the back. There in a sharp bend, the folds of which are clearly visible, it turns to the front, proceeding as an ascending tract, its visible part ending near the stomach. At this point the tract is directed to the left of the body, perpendicular to the fossil slab, and its course can thus no longer be followed. Nearby and slightly above, a subsequent intestine part surfaces that has been interpreted as the <b>jejunum.</b> This thinner intestine turns to the back, running parallel to the ascending tract of the duodenum and ultimately disappearing under it, at the level of the twelfth dorsal vertebra. Apparently a loop to the front is made because it resurfaces below the tenth dorsal vertebra, first running upwards and then turning to the back below the hind vertebral column — or at places even over it: probably after death its position partly shifted upwards. The <b>jejunum</b> seems to blend with an exceptionally short ileum. A contraction below the thirteenth dorsal vertebra might indicate the transition to the rectum. A caecum seems absent. The rectum runs to the back between the upper shafts of the pubes and ischia. Then it bends downwards parallel to the ischium shaft, at the end of it turning upwards again. In this final part faeces are still present. The cloaca is lacking. Dal Sasso & Maganuco suggested the cloaca exit was rather low, at the level of the ischial feet and that a rectocoprodaeal valve separated faeces and urine.|$|E
25|$|Small {{intestinal}} volvulus {{is thought}} to be caused by a change in local peristalsis, or due to a lesion that the mesentery may twist around (such as an ascarid impaction), and usually involves the distal <b>jejunum</b> and ileum.w It {{is one of the most}} common causes of small intestinal obstruction in foals, possibly because of a sudden change to a bulkier foodstuff. Animals present with acute and severe signs of colic, and multiple distended loops of small intestine, usually seen radiographically in a foal. Small intestinal volvulus often occurs secondary to another disease process in adult horses, where small intestinal obstruction causes distention and then rotation around the root of the mesentery. Surgery is required to resect nonviable sections of bowel, and prognosis is correlated to the length of bowel involved, with animals with greater than 50% of small intestinal involvement having a grave prognosis.|$|E
25|$|In the {{oesophagus}} tract {{about eight}} scales and some bone fragments are present. Dal Sasso & Maganuco considered {{it likely that}} these had not been swallowed as loose elements but were {{the remains of a}} meal, partly regurgitated from the stomach in the final death throes. In the stomach position itself, a cluster of small bones is visible. These include an ankle with a three millimetre wide metatarsus consisting of five metatarsals attached, a tail vertebra and the upper end of an ulna. If the remains represent a single prey animal, it is likely either a member of the Mesoeucrocodylia or some lepidosaurian lizard-like animal; the size indicates the last possibility. In the descending tract of the duodenum two clusters of lizard scales are present and, more below, a fish vertebra. The <b>jejunum</b> shows a cluster of dozens of fish vertebrae, likely having belonged to a member of the Clupeomorpha. A second cluster of vertebrae was found at the jejunum-ileum boundary. The final tract of the rectum still holds faeces in which a piece of skin is visible showing seventeen scales of a fish of the Osteoglossiformes that was nine seasons old, judging from the growth lines on the scales.|$|E
25|$|The {{primitive}} gut {{is suspended}} from the posterior abdominal wall by the dorsal mesentery. The gastrointestinal tract and associated dorsal mesentery are subdivided into foregut, midgut, and hindgut regions based on the respective blood supply. The foregut is supplied by the celiac trunk, the midgut is supplied by the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and the hindgut is supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). This division is established by the fourth week of development. After this, the midgut undergoes a period of rapid elongation, forcing it to herniate through the navel. During herniation, the midgut rotates 90° anti-clockwise around the axis of the SMA and forms the midgut loop. The cranial portion of the loop moves {{to the right and}} the caudal portion of the loop moves toward the left. This rotation occurs at about the eighth week of development. The cranial portion of the loop will develop into the <b>jejunum,</b> while most of the ileum and the caudal part of the loop eventually form the terminal portion of the ileum, the ascending colon and the initial two-thirds of the transverse colon. As the foetus grows larger, the mid-gut loop is drawn back through the umbilicus and undergoes a further 180° rotation, completing a total of 270° rotation. At this point, about 10 weeks, the caecum lies close to the liver. From here it moves in a cranial to caudal direction to eventually lie in the lower right portion of the abdominal cavity. This process brings the ascending colon to lie vertically in the lateral right portion of the abdominal cavity apposed to the posterior abdominal wall. The descending colon occupies a similar position on the left side.|$|E
500|$|The men {{knew that}} the {{pancreas}} produces digestive juices in response to increased acidity in the duodenum and <b>jejunum,</b> because of the arrival of chyme there. By severing the duodenal and jejunal nerves in anaesthetized dogs, while leaving the blood vessels intact, then introducing acid into the duodenum and <b>jejunum,</b> they discovered that the process is not mediated by a nervous response, but by {{a new type of}} chemical reflex. They named the chemical messenger secretin, because it is secreted by the intestinal lining into the bloodstream, stimulating the pancreas on circulation. In 1905 Starling coined the term hormone—from the Greek hormao [...] meaning [...] "I arouse" [...] or [...] "I excite"—to describe chemicals such as secretin that are capable, in extremely small quantities, of stimulating organs from a distance.|$|E
500|$|For cancers {{involving}} {{the head of}} the pancreas, the Whipple procedure is the most commonly attempted curative surgical treatment. This is a major operation which involves removing the pancreatic head and the curve of the duodenum together ("pancreato-duodenectomy"), making a bypass for food from the stomach to the <b>jejunum</b> ("gastro-jejunostomy") and attaching a loop of <b>jejunum</b> to the cystic duct to drain bile ("cholecysto-jejunostomy"). It can be performed only if the person is likely to survive major surgery and if the cancer is localized without invading local structures or metastasizing. It can, therefore, be performed only in a minority of cases. [...] Cancers of the tail of the pancreas can be resected using a procedure known as a distal pancreatectomy, which often also entails removal of the spleen. Nowadays, this can often be done using minimally invasive surgery.|$|E
500|$|In {{cases where}} a person is too ill to {{tolerate}} endoscopy or when a retrograde endoscopic approach fails to access the obstruction, a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) may be performed to evaluate the biliary system for placement of a percutaneous biliary drain (PBD). This is often necessary {{in the case of}} a proximal stricture or a bilioenteric anastomosis (a surgical connection between the bile duct and small bowel, such as the duodenum or <b>jejunum).</b> [...] Once access across the stricture is obtained, balloon dilation can be performed and stones can be swept forward into the duodenum. Due to potential complications of percutaneous biliary drain placement and the necessity of regular drain maintenance, a retrograde approach via ERCP remains first-line therapy.|$|E
2500|$|Certain {{species of}} {{bacteria}} are more {{commonly found in}} aspirates of the <b>jejunum</b> taken from patients with bacterial overgrowth. [...] The most common isolates are Escherichia coli, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, and Enterococcus species.|$|E
2500|$|The horse’s small {{intestine}} is [...] long and holds [...] This {{is the major}} digestive organ, and where most nutrients are absorbed. It has three parts, the duodenum, <b>jejunum</b> and ileum. [...] The majority of digestion occurs in the duodenum {{while the majority of}} absorption occurs in the <b>jejunum.</b> Bile from the liver aids in digesting fats in the duodenum combined with enzymes from the pancreas and {{small intestine}}. [...] Horses do not have a gall bladder, so bile flows constantly. Most food is digested and absorbed into the bloodstream from the small intestine, including proteins, simple carbohydrate, fats, and vitamins A, D, [...] Any remaining liquids and roughage move into the large intestine.|$|E
2500|$|Esophagectomy is {{the removal}} of {{a segment of the}} esophagus; as this shortens the length of the {{remaining}} esophagus, some other segment of the digestive tract is pulled up through the chest cavity and interposed. [...] This is usually the stomach or part of the large intestine (colon) or <b>jejunum.</b> Reconnection of the stomach to a shortened esophagus is called an esophagogastric anastomosis.|$|E
2500|$|Foreign {{bodies are}} common in animals, {{especially}} dogs and cats. [...] Dogs will readily eat toys, bones, and any object that either has food on it or retains the odor of food. [...] Unlike humans, dogs are susceptible to gastrointestinal obstruction due {{to their ability to}} swallow relatively large objects and pass them through the esophagus. [...] Foreign bodies most commonly become lodged in the stomach because of the inability to pass through the pyloric sphincter, and in the <b>jejunum.</b> [...] Symptoms of gastrointestinal obstruction include vomiting, abdominal pain, and depression due to dehydration. [...] Peritonitis results if either the stomach or intestine has ruptured. [...] Foreign bodies in the stomach can sometimes be removed by endoscopic retrieval or if necessary by gastrotomy. [...] Very often a simple Instrument to remove foreign bodies without operation endoscopy is the Hartmann Alligator Forceps. The instrument is manufactored from 8cm to 1 m length. Foreign bodies in the <b>jejunum</b> are removed by enterotomy.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{conditions}} can prevent {{the absorption of}} dietary niacin or tryptophan and lead to pellagra. Inflammation of the <b>jejunum</b> or ileum can prevent nutrient absorption, leading to pellagra, and this can in turn be caused by Crohn's disease. [...] Gastroenterostomy can also cause pellagra. Chronic alcoholism can also cause poor absorption which combines with a diet already low in niacin and tryptophan to produce pellagra. [...] Hartnup disease is a genetic disorder that reduces tryptophan absorption, leading to pellagra.|$|E
2500|$|Patients with {{bacterial}} overgrowth that is longstanding can develop complications of their illness {{as a result}} of malabsorption of nutrients. Anemia may occur from a variety of mechanisms, as many of the nutrients involved in production of red blood cells are absorbed in the affected small bowel. [...] Iron is absorbed in the more proximal parts of the small bowel, the duodenum and <b>jejunum,</b> and patients with malabsorption of iron can develop a microcytic anemia, with small red blood cells. Vitamin B12 is absorbed in {{the last part of the}} small bowel, the ileum, and patients who malabsorb vitamin B12 can develop a megaloblastic anemia with large red blood cells.|$|E
2500|$|As few as 2 to 10 oocysts can {{initiate}} an infection. [...] The parasite {{is located}} in the brush border of the epithelial cells of the small intestine. [...] They are mainly located in the <b>jejunum.</b> [...] When the sporozoites attach the epithelial cells’ membrane envelops them. [...] Thus, they are “intracellular but extracytoplasmic”. [...] The parasite can cause damage to the microvilli where it attaches. [...] The infected human excretes the most oocysts during the first week. [...] Oocysts can be excreted for weeks after the diarrhea subsides from infections by C. parvum or C. hominis; however, immunocompetent individuals with C. muris infections have been observed excreting oocysts for seven months.|$|E
2500|$|If medical {{treatment}} fails, {{or is not}} feasible due to severe illness, surgical intervention is required. The most common operation for SMA syndrome, duodenojejunostomy, was first proposed in 1907 by Bloodgood. Performed as either an [...] open surgery or laparoscopically, duodenojejunostomy involves {{the creation of an}} anastomosis between the duodenum and the <b>jejunum,</b> bypassing the compression caused by the AA and the SMA. [...] Less common surgical treatments for SMA syndrome include Roux-en-Y duodenojejunostomy, gastrojejunostomy, anterior transposition of the third portion of the duodenum, intestinal derotation, division of the ligament of Treitz (Strong's operation), and transposition of the SMA. Both transposition of the SMA and lysis of the duodenal suspensory muscle have the advantage that they do not involve the creation of an intestinal anastomosis.|$|E
2500|$|Thiamine is {{released}} {{by the action of}} phosphatase and pyrophosphatase in the upper small intestine. [...] At low concentrations, the process is carrier-mediated. At higher concentrations absorption also occurs via passive diffusion. Active transport is greatest in the <b>jejunum</b> and ileum, but it can be inhibited by alcohol consumption or by folic deficiency. Decline in thiamine absorption occurs at intakes above 5mg/day. The cells of the intestinal mucosa have thiamine pyrophosphokinase activity, but it is unclear as to whether the enzyme is linked to active absorption. The majority of thiamine present in the intestine is in the pyrophosphorylated form ThDP, but when thiamine arrives on the serosal side of the intestine it is often in the free form. The uptake of thiamine by the mucosal cell is likely coupled in some way to its phosphorylation/dephosphorylation. On the serosal side of the intestine, evidence has shown that discharge of the vitamin by those cells is dependent on Na+-dependent ATPase.|$|E
50|$|The <b>jejunum</b> {{lies between}} the {{duodenum}} and the ileum. The <b>jejunum</b> {{is considered to}} begin at the attachment of the suspensory muscle of the duodenum to the duodenum, a location called the duodenojejunal flexure. The division between the <b>jejunum</b> and ileum is not anatomically distinct. In adult humans, the small intestine is usually 6-7m long, about two-fifths of which (2.5 m) is the <b>jejunum.</b>|$|E
