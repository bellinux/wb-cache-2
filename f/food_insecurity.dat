5|$|Food {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale food power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and <b>food</b> <b>insecurity</b> in Africa are due to inconsistent output of food production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous <b>food</b> <b>insecurity</b> issues.|$|E

Starting in 2015, under the direction of and with assistance from the UN, the World Food Programme started the Madagascar Country Programme with the two main goals of long-term development/ reconstruction efforts and addressing the <b>food</b> <b>insecurity</b> issues in the southern regions of Madagascar. These goals plan to be accomplished by providing meals for specific schools in rural and urban priority areas and by developing national school feeding policies to increase consistency of nourishment throughout the country.

25|$|Food {{stability}} {{refers to}} the ability to obtain food over time. <b>Food</b> <b>insecurity</b> can be transitory, seasonal, or chronic. In transitory <b>food</b> <b>insecurity,</b> food may be unavailable during certain periods of time. At the food production level, natural disasters and drought result in crop failure and decreased food availability. Civil conflicts can also decrease access to food. Instability in markets resulting in food-price spikes can cause transitory <b>food</b> <b>insecurity.</b> Other factors that can temporarily cause <b>food</b> <b>insecurity</b> are loss of employment or productivity, which can be caused by illness. Seasonal <b>food</b> <b>insecurity</b> can result from the regular pattern of growing seasons in food production.|$|E

40|$|In {{the face}} of rising {{environmental}} and <b>food</b> <b>insecurities,</b> communities across the globe are increasingly organizing {{to regain control of}} agro-ecological systems. This thesis explores these struggles in the context of highland Guatemala, examining food/seed sovereignty and permaculture movements and the lived experiences of rural women, farmers and grassroots environmental collectives. First, this thesis explores the historical erosion of local seed sovereignty, women’s current roles in the food sovereignty movement and the gendered implications of both of these processes. Second, this thesis explores how grassroots collectives are drawing from permaculture’s principles to creatively address agricultural and environmental vulnerabilities through horizontal organizational frameworks. This thesis posits that the food sovereignty and permaculture movements not only offer promising approaches for agricultural production and environmental stewardship, but they also provide valuable insights into the process of promoting local self-determination, democratization, gender equality and resiliency within and beyond local movements...|$|R

25|$|Agriculture {{is a major}} {{industry}} in the United States, with California accounting for over 12% of the U.S. agriculture cash receipts. Over half of agricultural workers in California, contributing to the state's agriculture economy and providing the nation with over half of all fruits and vegetables, are undocumented. Despite undocumented laborers contributing to the agriculture industry, farm work and labor is among {{one of the lowest}} paid occupations in the U.S. Many undocumented communities suffer from <b>food</b> <b>insecurity</b> due to low wages, forcing families to purchase economically viable unhealthy food. Though existing food pantry and food stamp programs aid in reducing the amount of food insecure individuals, undocumented immigrants are ineligible for social service programs and studies have found that limited English acts as a barrier to food stamp program participation. Due to a lack of education, encounters with government agents, language barriers, undocumented individuals pose higher rates of <b>food</b> <b>insecurity</b> and hunger when compared to legal citizens. The Trump administration is attempting to draft new stricter immigration policies; undocumented individuals who fear being deported under the new policies, limit their interactions with government agencies, social service programs (e.g., food stamps), increasing their susceptibility to <b>food</b> <b>insecurity.</b>|$|E
40|$|Drawing on ethnographic {{research}} conducted in Nsisha, a rural village located {{close to the}} shores of Lake Victoria in northwestern Tanzania, this article analyzes how climate change and variability intersect with other stressors that affect rural livelihoods, particularly HIV/AIDS. The analysis integrates theories of vulnerability from both climate and HIV/AIDS literatures to show how these intersecting stressors compound livelihood vulnerability in complex ways. Climate change and variability are linked to declining agricultural yields {{and an increase in}} <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>insecurity</b> and poor health in this region. This situation heightens poverty and susceptibility to HIV/AIDS, compromising people’s abilities to cope and adapt. Because of social dynamics, single mothers and their children are particularly affected by these compound vulnerabilities. Climate change and variability are significant contributing vulnerability factors that sustain and exacerbate asymmetrical poverty, <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>insecurity,</b> and HIV/AIDS. By describing the links between vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and climate variability, findings highlight the importance of holistic and localized approaches to adaptation, instead of trying to isolate single issues. Prioritization of multidisciplinary research focusing on the socially differentiated and gendered distribution of vulnerability specifically in regard to poverty, <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>insecurity,</b> and HIV/AIDS is recommended as a means to enrich the understanding of climate change vulnerability. Adaptation strategies should address how climatic shifts interact with generalized poverty, <b>food</b> and nutrition <b>insecurity,</b> health, and gendered vulnerability in areas most affected...|$|R

Many indigenous food crops of Africa which promises to ameliorate nutritional <b>food</b> <b>insecurities</b> are presently neglected and under-utilized. African yam bean (AYB) is one of such crop with tremendous nutritional potentials.

40|$|To ease <b>food</b> <b>insecurities</b> in {{northern}} Canada, some remote communities started gardening initiatives {{to gain more}} access to locally grown foods. Bush beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.) were assessed for N, P, K, Mg, and Ca concentrations of foliage as indicators of plant nutrition in a calcareous silty loam soil of northern Ontario James Bay lowlands. Crops were grown in sole cropping and intercropping configurations, with comparisons made between an open field and an agroforestry site enclosed with willow (Salix spp.) trees. Foliage chemical analysis of the sites revealed an abundance of Ca, adequacies for Mg and N, and deficiencies in P and K. Intercropping bean and potato did not show significant crop–crop facilitation for nutrients. The agroforestry site showed to be a superior management practice for the James Bay lowland region, specifically for P. The agroforestry site had significantly greater P for bean plant (p = 0. 024) and potato foliage (p = 0. 002) compared to the open site.

In what follows, I analyze {{the development of}} the Agri-FoodBank (AFB) CSO in South Africa in order to critically examine PPPs. As part of the FoodBank South Africa (FBSA) network of food banks, the AFB has emerged to reduce rural and urban <b>food</b> <b>insecurities.</b> Building on the national system of food banks, the AFB aims to train small-scale rural farmers to sell their crops to the food bank’s network of local food organizations which then feed the urban poor. In the case of the AFB, findings suggest that the PPP emerged as a mutually beneficial collaboration between the state and FBSA, as the state needed political power and FBSA needed money. However, for this PPP to form, FBSA completely transformed its mission and structure to fit the state’s preference for rural development projects. Thus, although the AFB formed to empower FBSA, data findings indicate that the AFB has increased state control over FBSA. In this way, PPPs need to be understood within the context of local state-civil society relations, as methods of state control reflect South Africa’s unique version of neoliberalism...|$|R
