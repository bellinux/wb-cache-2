5|$|The element {{also has}} 42 nuclear isomers, with masses of 150, 151, 153–162, 166–180 (not every mass number {{corresponds}} {{to only one}} isomer). The most stable of them are lutetium-177m, with half-life of 160.4 days and lutetium-174m, with half-life of 142 days; this <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> half-lives of the ground states of all radioactive lutetium isotopes, except only for lutetium-173, 174, and 176.|$|E
30|$|However, trips {{need to be}} {{analysed}} in connection, in trip chains. The single {{trips are}} not isolated entities.

Looking at daily car trip chains, only 8  % <b>are</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 80  km and only 4  % of them <b>are</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> 120  km.

5|$|The ride is {{considered}} to be a terrain roller coaster, meaning the ride experiences various elevation changes. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the first. It drops through Thunderbolt's structure, which is located at the bottom of a hill in a ravine.|$|E
5|$|The tail, {{according}} to Schwartz, <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> in the potto. He {{does not provide}} measurements of the tail of AMZ 6698 and notes {{that at least one}} vertebra is missing, but Sarmiento counted 11 caudal vertebrae in an illustration of AMZ 6698 and Groves counted at least 15. However, Sarmiento found that the number of caudal vertebrae ranges from 5 to 17, with an average of 11, in pottos. Relatively long tails are also common in the western form of the potto, though {{according to}} Stump the tail of Pseudopotto <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> any seen in pottos. The false potto allegedly has shorter spines on its cervical (neck) and first and second thoracic (chest) vertebrae, but Leon notes that this feature is also seen in western pottos. Schwartz writes that the false potto differs from pottos and angwantibos in lacking a bifid (two-tipped) spine on the second cervical vertebra, but Sarmiento found this feature in 3 out of 11 potto specimens he examined.|$|E
5|$|The third island {{platform}} comprises platforms 9 to 12 and also {{dates from the}} 1930s. It <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> platforms 5–8 but the rear of a High Speed Train on the west end platforms will block part of the east end platform. A wide variety of trains use these platforms, including to and from London Paddington and London Waterloo and Weymouth.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|M.challengeri is {{considered}} {{to have the most}} primitive morphology of any species of Metanephrops, having even fewer novelties than the oldest known fossil species, M.rossensis. Its rostrum <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> that of other species in the thomsoni species group, and the ridge along the midline of the carapace only has two small spines. Unlike some other species of Metanephrops, the carapace is smooth, as are the abdominal tergae, and the chelipeds are covered in fine granules.|$|E
5|$|Phantom's Revenge (formerly {{known as}} Steel Phantom) is a steel roller coaster at Kennywood. When {{it opened in}} 1991, it was the fastest roller coaster and had the longest drop of any roller coaster in the world. The ride was {{originally}} manufactured by Arrow Dynamics. After the 2000 season, D.H. Morgan Manufacturing {{was brought in to}} renovate the ride, most notably to remove the four inversions. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop through Thunderbolt's structure <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> its first drop.|$|E

5000|$|The second rule {{of thumb}} is that no {{activity}} or group of activities at the lowest level of detail of the WBS should <b>be</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> a single reporting period.

5|$|The {{effects of}} BZP are largely similar to {{amphetamine}}s, with one study finding that former amphetamine addicts {{were unable to}} distinguish between dextroamphetamine and BZP administered intravenously. Users report alertness, euphoria and a general feeling of well being. The perception of certain sensations such as taste, colour or music may be subjectively enhanced. The average duration <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> that of dextroamphetamine, typically lasting 4–6 hours with reports as long as 8 hours depending on the dose. A recent study has shown that mixtures of BZP with other piperazine drugs such as TFMPP share certain pharmacodynamic traits with MDMA.|$|E
5|$|The element {{also has}} 18 nuclear isomers, with mass numbers of 133 to 142, 144, 148, 149, 152, and 154 (some mass numbers {{have more than}} one isomer). The most stable of them is promethium-148m, with a {{half-life}} of 43.1days; this <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> the half-lives of the ground states of all promethium isotopes, except for promethium-143 to 147. In fact, promethium-148m has a longer half-life than its ground state, promethium-148.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> it is broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader than it is long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences that separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E

The paraconid is distinct. The hypoconulid lobe <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> in Afrotarsius and the entoconid is located further to the front. Unlike on m2, there is no notch between the hypoconulid and entoconid, though a shallow valley is present.|$|E
5|$|The {{single tooth}} of Trapalcotherium is {{identified}} as a lower molar because it has two longitudinal rows of cusps; as a first molar because it <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> wide; and as a left tooth because the left side (interpreted as labial, {{in the direction of}} the lips) bears more cusps than the right side (lingual, the direction of the tongue). The tooth is 2.48mm long and 2.07mm wide. Part of the back labial corner is missing.|$|E
5|$|Alcelaphus lelwel x cokii: Known as the Kenya Highland {{hartebeest}} or the Laikipia hartebeest. It is a {{cross between}} the Lelwel and Coke's hartebeest. This hybrid is lighter in colour and larger than Coke's hartebeest. It is a light buff with reddish-tawny upper parts, and the head <b>is</b> <b>longer</b> <b>than</b> in Coke's hartebeest. Both sexes have horns, which are heavier as well as longer {{than those of the}} parents. It was formerly distributed throughout the western Kenyan highlands, between Lake Victoria and Mount Kenya, but is now believed to be restricted to the Lambwe Valley (south-west Kenya) and Laikipia and nearby regions of west-central Kenya.|$|E
