In 1919 he met drummer Sonny Greer from New Jersey, who encouraged Ellington's ambition to become a professional musician. Ellington built his music business through his day job: when a customer asked {{him to make a}} sign for a dance or party, he would ask if they had musical entertainment; if not, Ellington would offer to play for the occasion. He also had a messenger job with the U.S. Navy and State departments, where he made a wide range of contacts. Ellington moved out of his parents' home and bought his own as he became a successful pianist. At first, he played in other ensembles, and in late 1917 formed his first group, [...] "The Duke's Serenaders" [...] ("Colored Syncopators", his telephone <b>directory</b> <b>advertising</b> proclaimed). He was also the group's booking agent. His first play date was at the True Reformer's Hall, where he took home 75 cents.|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary]: The World Wide Web is a {{valuable}} source of information {{for all sorts of}} products and services. Town councils use the web to provide town residents and visitors with large amounts of information. One resource provided by many town councils is a community information directory containing details of local services including health services. Other sources of health service information are frequently insufficiently detailed at the local level. The Centre for Rural and Remote Area Health (CRRAH), a joint centre of the universities of Queensland and Southern Queensland, was interested in the value of these directories to town residents as a source about health services. This interest was prompted by the observations from health service providers in southern Queensland that sources of information about services are limited within the communities. Questionnaires were distributed in four towns in southern Queensland by mail and in health clinics. In addition interviews were conducted in the street. All four towns have community information <b>directories.</b> Two <b>directories</b> <b>advertise</b> themselves as a source of health service information. All four directories contain information about health services within the town. The extent of the information varies from town to town according to the criteria that are placed on inclusion. Questions determined the respondents’ use of the internet, awareness of town community directories, use of the local directory to find information about health services and other sources of information. Almost sixty percent of the 1125 respondents use the internet. This was highly correlated with age with fewer than 20...|$|R

40|$|The Interactive DIF Generator (IDG) utility {{is a tool}} used to {{generate}} and manipulate Directory Interchange Format files (DIF). Its purpose as a specialized text editor is to create and update DIF files which {{can be sent to}} NASA's Master Directory, also referred to as the International Global Change Directory at Goddard. Many government and university data systems use the Master <b>Directory</b> to <b>advertise</b> the availability of research data. The IDG interface consists of a set of four windows: (1) the IDG main window; (2) a text editing window; (3) a text formatting and validation window; and (4) a file viewing window. The IDG main window starts up the other windows and contains a list of valid keywords. The keywords are loaded from a user-designated file and selected keywords can be copied into any active editing window. Once activated, the editing window designates the file to be edited. Upon switching from the editing window to the formatting and validation window, the user has options for making simple changes to one or more files such as inserting tabs, aligning fields, and indenting groups. The viewing window is a scrollable read-only window that allows fast viewing of any text file. IDG is an interactive tool and requires a mouse or a trackball to operate. IDG uses the X Window System to build and manage its interactive forms, and also uses the Motif widget set and runs under Sun UNIX. IDG is written in C-language for Sun computers running SunOS. This package requires the X Window System, Version 11 Revision 4, with OSF/Motif 1. 1. IDG requires 1. 8 Mb of hard disk space. The standard distribution medium for IDG is a. 25 inch streaming magnetic tape cartridge in UNIX tar format. It is also available on a 3. 5 inch diskette in UNIX tar format.

40|$|The current {{increase}} in interest in Internet Multicast and Multimedia Applications is self-evident and has profited from such infrastructures as the Multicast Backbone (Mbone) and its applications and tools which are several years old now. However, an ad-hoc usage {{of some of}} this technology's features, namely, session announcements and multicast addresses, do not scale easily. The Session Description Protocol (SDP), a proposed standard, has been used and sometimes misused as a session <b>directory</b> tool to <b>advertise</b> multimedia sessions, without due attention to scalability, i. e., without taking into consideration {{the effect of the}} increasing number of simultaneous sessions being announced. A flat presentation of session announcements, with alphabeticaly ordered names, neither scale nor convey enough structured information to enable simple and efficient directory searches to pick up all the interesting sessions. This is what is really needed while keeping the directory manageable. SDP and its companion Session Announcement Protocol (SAPv 1) have enough scaling potential, if not misused. The quality of information presented to the user by popular tools, such as sdr, may be enhanced to a level similar to that obtained via the familiar Internet search engines and browsing and filtering services. Instead of burdening the user with the task of browsing and filtering the flat directory space, that task could be assigned to a server, should the information made available in the session descriptions be conveniently organised. We propose that session directory information be structured and then disclosed by a Multicast Session Directory Service (MSDS). Session description fields in SDP, such as the value attributes category (a=cat:) and type (a=type:) and selected description fields, such as media, repeat times, time active, and so on, may be used to aggregate sessions in classes and even in a pre-arranged classification hierarchy. The user would then be able to query or browse MSDS servers. The service itself would be announced either in multiple thematic or single well known multicast channels, with the directory structure being either port or time multiplexed, or made available as a server database...|$|R
