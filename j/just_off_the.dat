5|$|Tropical Storm Debby was {{the fifth}} {{tropical}} storm of the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season. Debby formed <b>just</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Africa on August 21 from a tropical wave. After passing near the Cape Verde islands, Debby moved generally northwestward for much of its life, reaching a peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h). Strong wind shear weakened the storm, and Debby dissipated on August 27 over the northern Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|A {{tropical}} depression {{formed in the}} western Gulf of Mexico on September14 and moved eastward. The storm produced heavy seas across the region, which damaged two small boats. After turning to the northeast, the storm reached peak winds of , followed by executing a clockwise loop from September16 through September18. After maintaining peak winds for about five days, the storm weakened, by which time it curved to the northeast. On September20, it moved ashore in Taylor County, Florida and later crossed the state. The storm dissipated on September21 <b>just</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> Georgia coast.|$|E

5|$|As Emilia first {{approached}} the southwest coast of Mexico, officials issued {{a tropical storm}} watch from Manzanillo to Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco; the watch was discontinued 30hours after it was issued. The storm passed the region on July 22, and {{is believed to have}} produced tropical storm force wind gusts along the coastline. A ship recorded 40mph (65km/h) winds while Emilia was <b>just</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast. Further up the coast, in Mazatlán, strong waves from the storm caused beaches to close, while the outer fringes of the storm dropped 4.68inches (119mm) of precipitation. Inland, the interaction between Emilia and a tropical wave brought increased moisture and precipitation to southeastern and central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen is {{recognized}} as one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the world. As a result of its commitment to high environmental standards, Copenhagen has been praised for its green economy, ranked as the top green city for the second time in the 2014 Global Green Economy Index (GGEI). In 2001 a large offshore wind farm was built <b>just</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Copenhagen at Middelgrunden. It produces about 4% of the city's energy. Years of substantial investment in sewage treatment have improved water quality in the harbour to an extent that the inner harbour can be used for swimming with facilities at a number of locations.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Alex {{was a rare}} June {{hurricane}} and {{the first}} tropical cyclone to develop in the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season. Originating from an area of disturbed weather on June25, 2010, it slowly developed in the western Caribbean Sea and struck Belize as a strong tropical storm. After entering the Gulf of Mexico, Alex became very large and encountered conditions favorable for gradual development. Early on June30, the cyclone attained hurricane status as it approached northeastern Mexico, the first June hurricane in the Atlantic basin since Hurricane Allison in 1995, and the storm rapidly intensified <b>just</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Tamaulipas. Alex came ashore near Soto la Marina as a Category2 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale.|$|E
5|$|Lili {{continued}} generally southward, {{reaching its}} peak intensity of 80mph (130km/h). Higher pressures developed to its northeast, {{resulting in the}} hurricane to accelerate to the southwest. On December 22, Lili finished executing its large cyclonic loop by passing over the same location it passed one week prior. The combination of its increased forward speed, as well as increased levels of vertical wind shear, created an unfavorable environment which caused steady weakening. On December 23, Lili weakened to a tropical storm while located 430miles (690km) northeast of Antigua. It rapidly lost organization as it approached the Leeward Islands, and dissipated <b>just</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of the Dominican Republic on December 24.|$|E
5|$|On August27, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began {{monitoring}} a large mass of convection {{associated with}} a tropical wave <b>just</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> western coast of Africa. An {{area of low pressure}} formed in association with the disturbance the following day, gaining sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 06:00UTC on August29 approximately 430miles (690km) southwest of the southernmost Cabo Verde Islands. The depression initially struggled upon designation, with its well-defined center displaced near the northeastern edge of the storm's convection as a result of strong east-northeasterly wind shear. By 00:00UTC on August30, however, an increase in the cyclone's convective organization marked its intensification into Tropical Storm Katia.|$|E
