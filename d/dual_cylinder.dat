40|$|The {{development}} and transmission/reflection {{characteristics of a}} 3 D <b>dual</b> <b>cylinder</b> Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) is presented. The investigation shows that {{the length of the}} resonant cylinders in the unit cell has significant effect on the frequency characteristics of the FSS, and the FSS can produce close band or highly selective responses. A stop and pass band very close to one another (essentially 1 : 1 band ratio) is achieved using equal length cylinders, without the need for any active components. Independently varying the unit cell cylinder heights produced a highly selective pass band with less than 0. 3 dB insertion loss and deep nulls only approximately 500 kHz on either side. The <b>dual</b> <b>cylinder</b> 3 D FSS was also experimentally verified, achieving very good agreement between the simulation and measurement results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Non-edible {{filtered}} {{neem oil}} based mono esters (biodiesel) produced and blended with diesel were tested {{for their use}} as substitute fuels of diesel engines in terms of emission. The major objective of the present investigation is to experimentally access the emission performance of biodiesel and find the optimum blending ratio in a <b>dual</b> <b>cylinder</b> diesel engine used in generating sets and the agricultural applications in India. Diesel; neat biodiesel from neem and their blends (10, 20 and 30 percentage by volume) were used for conducting tests at varying loads. It is observed that thirty percentage neem with diesel blend gives the better emission test (in terms of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrocarbon, smoke density) than other blend ratios of neem biodiesel. The higher fuel consumption of neem biodiesel is due to higher flash point and viscosity than petroleum diesel. The higher the flash point of the biodiesel, the better atomization process will be performed. Thirty percentage blends of bio-diesel (bio-diesel produced from non- edible sources like neem) {{have been found to}} comply with all specification of diesel fuel. The cetane number, flash point and lubricity of the blended fuel are observed to be better than commercial diesel fuel. Index Terms—Neem Biodiesel, Transesterification, Emission Test I...|$|E
40|$|Many {{cylindrical}} {{structures in}} engineering applications undergo flow-induced periodic loading {{due to the}} vortex shedding phenomenon. This can lead to early fatigue failure and {{be a source of}} unwanted noise. To mitigate or reduce the mean and fluctuating loading, the flow development can be altered by adding geometrical modifications to the structure. This thesis is focused on the <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinder</b> geometry, which consists of a finite-span circular cylinder (the large cylinder) attached co-axially to the mid-span of a uniform circular cylinder of smaller diameter (the small <b>cylinder).</b> The <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinder</b> is a geometrical modification to a uniform cylinder that is ubiquitous in engineering applications, but has not been investigated extensively for its potential use in flow control. Accordingly, {{there is a need for}} developing an understanding of the flow development and structural loading on <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinders</b> in cross-flow. This thesis provides a comprehensive characterization of the effects of <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinder</b> geometry and Reynolds number on wake development and structural loading in the turbulent vortex shedding regime. Experiments were carried out in the Water Flume Facility at the University of Waterloo and an open jet wind tunnel at TU Delft. Experimental measurements included flow and surface visualizations, wake velocity measurements with Tomographic Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), planar PIV, and Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV), and lift and drag force measurements. Through an analysis of the qualitative and quantitative results, six distinct flow regimes have been identified based on observed changes in the flow development downstream of the large cylinder. The results are summarized in a two-dimensional map which has both practical and fundamental importance. Specifically, the map can be used to select <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinder</b> geometries which produce desirable flow and loading characteristics, and the map provides detailed insight into the turbulent wake development of <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinders</b> and other similar complex cylindrical geometries including cantilevered cylinders, single step cylinders, coin-like cylinders, and cylinders with two free ends. For complex bluff body geometries, such as that of a <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinder,</b> the flow development is highly three-dimensional. In order to investigate such flows experimentally, quantitative measurements of the three-dimensional flow field are required. The presently available techniques of three-dimensional velocity field measurement, e. g., Tomographic PIV, Particle Tracking Velocimetry, and Holography, are expensive to implement and are not yet commonplace in experimental facilities world-wide. The present study employs multi-plane PIV measurements in order to investigate the three-dimensional wake development of a <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinder.</b> Two techniques of multi-plane PIV data analysis are proposed in order to reconstruct the dominant vortical structures and vortex interactions in the wake: (i) a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based phase-averaging approach, and (ii) a pattern recognition based conditional averaging approach. Through a comparison with Tomographic PIV results, both techniques are shown to successfully reconstruct the wake vortex shedding and vortex interactions downstream of a <b>dual</b> step <b>cylinder.</b> The techniques developed can be applied to complex bluff body flows and can accommodate the presence of more than one dominant frequency...|$|R

The Wigner measures are identified with the cluster points of (generalized) sequences of regular states, indexed by the semiclassical parameter h→ 0. All the measures are vector-valued, with values in the positive continuous functionals of A. If the Heisenberg group is infinite dimensional, the Wigner measures are cylindrical measures, i. e. finitely additive measures on the algebra of (<b>dual)</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Our analysis shows that, for infinite-dimensional Heisenberg groups, the semiclassical structure that emerges in the limit is richer than in the finite-dimensional case.

40|$|Soy sauce cakes contain about 5 – 10 wt% salt; therefore, {{incineration}} {{results in}} corrosion of the furnace and environmental problems related to, for example, dioxin generation. However, amino and organic acids, and soybean isoflavone, {{as well as}} a number of other useful components remain in the soy sauce cakes. The amount of desalination with water was 590 mg/ 10 g-feed, while that with methanol was about 70 % of this value. Desalination could not be performed successfully with acetone or n-hexane. The amounts of flavonoid in the form of daidzein and genistein extracted from 10 g of soy sauce cake were 3. 4 – 7. 2 and 7. 2 – 11. 0 mg, respectively, while extraction with water was minimal. Moreover, the amount of flavonoids extracted increased while the amount of desalination decreased with aqueous alcohol solutions. The <b>dual</b> <b>cylinder</b> solid–liquid extractor presented here for separation of flavonoids and salt from soy sauce cakes was able to collect 10. 2 mg/ 50 g-feed of daidzein and 18. 8 mg/ 50 g-feed of genistein. The length of time the sample is retained in the mixer can be varied by changing the agitation speed, the number of baffle plates and the diameter of the mixer cylinder outlet.
