40|$|Production of wet crude {{due to the}} {{raise in}} {{oil-water}} contact in many Iranian oil fields had been a growing field problem. Application of the right technology and installation of proper desalting facilities were required to solve this problem. Therefore, {{it was decided to}} install electrostatic desalting plants progressively in Iranian oil fields. By end of 2004, more than 20 plants with a total capacity of 1. 3 MMSTB/day of treated crude had been installed. It is expected that production of wet crude will rise to 2. 3 MMSTB/day in Iran by the year 2007. The performance of the majority of current desalting plants have been tested and found satisfactory. New equations covering a wide range of oil types are developed to estimate the optimum treating rate, treating temperature, and treating viscosity for dual polarity and AC conventional electrostatic <b>desalters</b> in Iranian oil fields. Based on these equations, this study suggests that dual polarity electrostatic <b>desalters</b> are more beneficial economically when compared with AC conventional electrostatic <b>desalters.</b> Dual polarity <b>desalters</b> may operate at a minimum crude oil inlet temperature, resulting in extra fuel savings, eliminating the need for a heating system in the vessel.

40|$|Pre-heat trains {{differ from}} most other heat {{recovery}} networks {{in a number}} of important ways. Combination of factors gives rise to the need for a design procedure specific to pre-heat trains. Outlining these factors, we first observe that one cold stream (the incoming crude) dominates the heat demand. We next observe that the heat recovery comes from streams a number of streams having similar temperature spans. Looking at typical Composite Curves (Figure 1) we observe that rather than the presence of a distinct and clear 'pinch point', the curves are close together over quite a large temperature region. Consideration of the process leads to the observation that the heating is undertaking in three distinct stages: storage to <b>desalter,</b> <b>desalter</b> to preflash and preflash to column. The operating temperature of both <b>desalter</b> and preflash can only be varied over a relatively small temperature span. Finally, we see that fouling is an important consideration. At the hot end of the train, this fouling is affected by velocity and by exchanger wall temperature. Consideration of fouling must be incorporated into the design procedure...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 The fouling {{characteristics}} of a desalted crude oil were investigated in a systematic investigation. There are two main parts in this study, the dry bulk tests (dehydrated crude oil) and the wet bulk tests (to which <b>desalter</b> brine was added). Three barrels of desalted crude oil provided by Amoco Oil Company were studied. For the dry bulk tests, no brine {{was added to the}} crude oil. The effects of fluid velocity and surface temperature on fouling were investigated. The higher the surface temperature the greater the fouling was observed. Fouling decreased with an increase of fluid velocity. Fluid velocity had a stronger effect on fouling at low surface temperatures than at high surface temperatures. It was also observed that the fouling behavior of crude oil depended on small difference in composition. The threshold surface temperatures for the initiation of fouling were 400 - 450 °F (3. 0 ft/sec), 525 - 550 °F (5. 5 ft/sec), 550 - 600 °F (8. 0 ft/sec) and about 600 °F (10. 0 ft/sec) for Barrel No. 2 and Barrel No. 3.

More than 99 % of the energy mix burned at these plants is natural gas, with the remainder provided by fuel oil, crude oil, and gas oil [34]. To estimate the total emissions for each plant attributable to residential water production under each scenario, we multiply the emission rate (g/kW h) for each plant by the total energy (Energywater,total, in kW h/m 3) used for water production and by the total amount of water produced to meet residential demand in Abu Dhabi City in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Desalting {{technique}} {{used in the}} Sarir Field (in Libya) has been studied. Salt content after electric <b>desalter</b> {{is found to be}} high.

On the basis of research work it is suggested to replace the existing crude oil desalting system with the new one comprising of major equipment as multiple-orifice plate mixers, hydrocyclone disaster and pressure filter using diatomaceous earth as a filter medium. The data showed that on adopting the new technology, the production operating cost was reduced significantly and the salts content in the crude oil was diminished remarkably.

40|$|When first {{received}} by a refinery, the crude oil usually contains some water, mineral salts, and sediments. The salt appears in different forms, most often times it is dissolved {{in the formation}} water {{that comes with the}} crude i. e. in brine form, but it could also be present as solid crystals, water-insoluble particles of corrosion products or scale and metal-organic compounds such as prophyrins and naphthenates. The amount of salt in the crude can vary typically between 5 to 200 PTB depending on the crude source, API, viscosity and other properties of the crude. For the following reasons, it is of utmost importance {{to reduce the amount of}} salt in the crude before processing the crude in the Crude Distillation Unit and consequently downstream processing units of a refinery. 1. Salt causes corrosion in the equipment. 2. Salt fouls inside the equipment. The fouling problem not only negatively impacts the heat transfer rates in the exchangers and furnace tubes but also affects the hydraulics of the system by increasing the pressure drops and hence requiring more pumping power to the system. Salt also plugs the fractionator trays and causes reduced mass transfer i. e. reduced separation efficiency and therefore need for increased re-boiler/condenser duties. 3. The salt in the crude usually has a source of metallic compounds, which could cause poisoning of catalyst in hydrotreating and other refinery units. Until a few years ago, salt concentrations as high as 10 PTB (1 PTB = 1 lb salt per 1000 bbl crude) was acceptable for desalted crude; However, most of the refineries have adopted more stringent measures for salt content and recent specs only allow 1 PTB in the desalted crude. This would require many existing refineries to improve their desalting units to achieve the tighter salt spec. This study will focus on optimizing the salt removal efficiency of a desalting unit which currently has an existing single-stage <b>desalter.</b> By adding a second stage <b>desalter,</b> the required salt spec in the desalted crude will be met. Also, focus will be on improving the heat integration of the desalting process, and optimization of the desalting temperature to achieve the best operating conditions in the plant after revamp. 1 yea...|$|E

40|$|Failure {{investigation}} {{was done on}} a 321 stainless steel charge heater tube which failed in a refinery unit processing heavy crude oil. Crude oil was the charge in the radiant and convection sections; while saturated stripping steam is present in convection section. After a leak was detected, visual inspection revealed that nine convection tubes had black oil/coke deposits on their external surfaces. The deposits were seen on the first three rows of tubes. When one of the tubes was lightly ground at the black colored area, a circumferential crack was visually observed. The investigation revealed that long-term aging, coupled with localized deposition of salts and coke from the heavy crude led to sensitization of the tube surface layers. This in turn resulted in sulphidation of the internal surface grain boundaries, formation of grooves, and cracking of the material. Thus, cracking was intergranular in nature in the initial stage, but became transgranular at later stages. It was concluded that cracking was due to chloride stress corrosion cracking catalyzed {{by the presence of}} sulphur-bearing species.

This method requires no expensiveequipment, resolvesa standard mixture of 17 a-amino acids, is consistently reproducible, and requires less than 7 hr from start to visualizationof the chromatogram. DENT (1) introduced paper chromatography for tile ilivestigatioll of amino-aciduria in 1948. However, his one-dimensional system yielded inadequate separation, and his two-dimensional method required 3 days. Since then, technics utilizing gas chromatography (2 - 4), thin layer chromatography, column chromatography, and high voltage electro-phoresis (5 - 7) have been published for tile determination of amillo acids in urine. All of these methods exhibit good resolution and permit quantitation. However, they suffer from either a need of costly equip-ment or extreme consumption of time.

NAs are ubiquitous in refinery wastewater streams and the <b>desalter</b> brine was found to be the main source of NAs in refinery wastewater. A commercial NA mixture was not biodegraded under nitrate-reducing or methanogenic/fermentative conditions. NAs were degraded under aerobic conditions by an NA-enriched culture; however, a residual fraction was not degraded under all conditions studied. The results indicated that NAs are not inherently recalcitrant and the residual fraction was due to the individual NA concentrations being below the minimum substrate concentrations at which they are no longer degraded. A fraction of the NA mixture was completely mineralized to carbon dioxide, with the remaining portion biotransformed to more oxidized intermediates. Overall, the results indicated that NAs were degraded under aerobic conditions; however, biological treatment of NA-bearing wastewater will not completely remove NA concentrations and thus, biological treatment must be combined with physical/chemical treatment to achieve complete NA removal.

It {{is not yet}} understood how the network of biomass polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin) gives rise to this intermediate "soft" network and how volatiles are ejected from this "metaplast" and then transported within the pores. To understand such mechanisms, it is needed to develop analytical methods for analyzing heavy species (eg. cellulose or hemicelluloses oligomers) which are ejected and condensed in bio-oils or extractables by water after a quench of biomass particles. Several HPLC methods were developed the past years and the most common ones are based on Ion Chromatography such as HPAEC-PAD (High Pressure Anion Exchange Chromatography coupled to a Pulsed Amperometric Detector). The lack of specificity in detection for this method was recently overcome by Yu et al. (Curtin Univ.). HPAED-PAD-MS coupling was developed to quantify liquid products from cellulose decomposition. However, due to a high salt content, an in-line <b>desalter</b> has {{to be used for}} mass spectrometry leading to a loss of information. Another way to overcome this problem is to use Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) especially because of its non-chemical selectivity, thus all type water-soluble content can be analyzed in addition to a high molecular mass limit (up to 4000 Da). Levoglucosan and DPs= 2 to 5 polysaccharides were analyzed by both SEC-Evaporative Light Selective Detector (ELSD) combined by Electro Spray Ionisation (ESI) -Mass Spectrometry (MS), in order to compare accuracy in quantification between mass spectrometry ion signals and ELSD's signals.

The main {{objectives}} of the GOSP are: - Separation of the associated gas through pressure drop in two series stages one to 120 psig {{and the other to}} 50 psig. - Separation of water by gravity separators called High Pressure Production Trap (HPPT), Dehydrator, <b>Desalter</b> and Water Oil Separator (WOSEP). - Reducing salt concentration to less than 10 PTB utilizing wash water and demulsifier. During the desalting process, the challenge is to overcome the existence of an emulsion layer at the interface between oil and water. In petroleum industry normally emulsions encountered are some kind of water droplets dispersed in a continuous phase of oil. In crude oil emulsions, emulsifying agents are present at the oil-water interface, hindering this coalescence process. Such agents include scale and clay particles, added chemicals or indigenous crude oil components like asphaltenes, resins, waxes and naphthenic acids. Many techniques made available to gas oil separation plant operators to minimize the effect of tight emulsions. These techniques include injection of demulsifier, increasing oil temperature, gravity separation in large vessels with high retention time as well as electrostatic voltage. From experience and studies these variables have been already optimized to a good extent; however, from the believe that knowledge never stop, this study is conducted targeting enhancing the demulsifier control and optimizing the wash water rate. The objective {{of this study is to}} design an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on data set to cover wide operating range of all parameters effecting demulsifier dosage.

40|$|In an oil refinery, {{crude oil}} is heated to 360 - 370 °C before {{entering}} a distillation columnoperating at atmospheric pressure where the gas fraction and several liquid fractions withdifferent boiling points (e. g. gasoline, kerosene, diesel, gas oil, heavy gas oil) are separated off. The crude oil is heated in two stages. The preheat train - {{a series of}} heat exchangers - heats itfrom ambient temperature to about 270 °C when it enters the furnace, known as the coil inlettemperature. The furnace then heats the oil to the temperature required for distillation. The purpose of the preheat train is to recover heat from the liquid products extracted in thedistillation column. Without this, 2 - 3 % of the crude oil throughput {{would be used for}} heating thefurnace; with the preheat train up to 70 % of the required heat is recovered. It also serves tocool the refined products: further cooling normally uses air or water. Over time, fouling reduces the performance of the heat exchangers, increasing the amount ofenergy that has to be supplied. It is possible to bypass units to allow them to be cleaned, withan associated cost and temporary loss of performance. The cleaning schedule thus has animpact on the overall efficiency, cost of operation and emissions. The group at the Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology at Cambridgedeveloped a scheduling algorithm for this non-linear optimisation problem. It yields a good,though not-necessarily optimal, schedule and can handle additional constraints, such as thepresence of desalters with specific temperature requirements within the preheat train. This isnow being developed into a commercial software product. Data from two refineries - one operated by Repsol YPF in Argentina and the Esso FawleyRefinery in the UK - were used to model the systems and test the algorithm. For the Repsol YPF refinery, when compared with current practice and including a constrainton the <b>desalter</b> inlet temperature, the most conservative estimate of the emissions reductionwas 773 t CO 2 /year. This assumed a furnace efficiency of 90 %. The emissions reductionincreased to 927 t CO 2 /year at 75 % efficiency and 1730 t CO 2 /year at 40 %. These were basedon a stoichiometric estimate of the emissions from the furnace. Using a standard emissionfactor increased them by 7. 4 %. For Esso Fawley, the estimated emission reduction compared to no maintenance was 1435 t CO 2 /year at 90 % furnace efficiency.

40|$|Having {{reviewed}} {{the analysis of}} Fula crude oil prior to desalting treatment, {{it was observed that}} the crude has high density of 936. 2 kg/m 3 at 15 o C, high viscosity of 69. 42 mm 2 /s at 100 oC and high calcium content of 1287 ppm (table(2. 1)). On the other hand it was observed that the calcium content after electrical desalting was also high amounting up to 307 ppm((table (2. 3)). The high calcium content affects the price and the environmental specifications. Inefficient separation process of salts causes serious problems such as discount of oil price, corrosion risks at the distillation columns, catalytic poisoning, formation of scale deposits in pipes and heat - exchangers. Although the electrical desalting treatment is very efficient for dehydration of crude, the efficiency of such device for calcium separation was low. Equipment other than the electrical desalting unit were reviewed, and it was found that a mixer – settler type of contactors was quite suitable and might improve the efficiency of calcium separation. A Preliminary investigation was undertaken to investigate the factors of temperature, dilution ratio, water to oil ratio, time and speed of agitation on the fluid properties mainly the density and viscosity. From the preliminary study the range of the low and high levels of the above mentioned factors were (90 - 120 oC, 5 - 30 %, 10 - 80 %, 5 - 20 minutes and 300 - 400 rpm) respectively. Once determining the range of the above mentioned parameters, factorial experiments were designed to investigate the effects of these parameters on dehydration and salt separation. 9 One set of the experiments were carried out {{with the addition of a}} demulsifier and the other set was carried out without any addition as shown in tables (4. 12) and (4. 13). These experiments showed that the demulsifier had improved the dehydration and settlement, but in both sets of factorial experiments no improvement was observed on calcium separation. This was because the calcium was fixed to the crude in form of calcium naphthanate which was difficult to remove. Hence, it was decided to use acetic acid as a decalcinizing agent, as the acetic acid has the ability to break this fixation. Various concentrations of the decalcinizer were studied, the results showed that the concentration level at 0. 8 % and pH level of 5 improved the calcium removal, table(4. 19). Having specified the levels of all factors as well the concentrations of the demulsifier and the decalcinizer, a controlled experiment was carried out to determine the number of actual stages required to remove the calcium content up to 98. 0 ppm. A mixer – settler contactor was designed at the same levels taking the input rate of the <b>desalter</b> of Khartoum refinery, the dimensions of the mixer-settler were shown in tables(4. 22) and (4. 23). In conclusion a mixer –settler is recommended to be used for desalting of Fula crude due to its high separation efficiency of calcium and its low cost...|$|E
