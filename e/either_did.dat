5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There was no immediate pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home <b>either</b> <b>did</b> not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.|$|E

5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks <b>either</b> <b>did</b> not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E

The caller then tried to inform the operator that there was someone with a gun, {{but he was in}} a state of panic at the time and the operator couldn't understand the situation. At 11:46, it was finally determined a shooter was involved, and the incident was reclassified as a shooting.|$|E

25|$|The rimes */ɔk/ (အောက်) */ɔŋ/ (အောင်) are {{somewhat}} problematic from a linguistic perspective. Despite {{the fact that}} these rimes are written with the same compound vowel diacritics which indicate the open syllable /ɔ/, as noted above, the rime */aw/ is viewed by linguists to have been a closed syllable and thus, it is assumed that the */aw/ vowel which resulted in MSB /ɔ/ is distinct from the vowel in the rimes */ɔk/ */ɔŋ/ which <b>either</b> <b>did</b> not exist in open syllables, or merged completely with a vowel which did. Whatever the etymology, in MSB the rimes */ɔk/ */ɔŋ/ are realised as /ăʊʔ/ /ãʊ/, and realised /ɔ̆ʔ/ /ɔ̃ː/ in Tavoyan.|$|E
25|$|There {{were many}} suspicions that corrupt figures in {{authority}} had helped Leggio avoid justice, {{with plenty of}} suspicion falling on the General Attorney of Sicily, Pietro Scaglione, who was shot dead on 5 May 1971 with his police bodyguard Antonino Lo Russo. Pentiti Tommaso Buscetta and Salvatore Contorno later said Leggio personally shot Scaglione dead because he <b>either</b> <b>did</b> {{not want him to}} help deliver an acquittal for one of the Corleonesi boss's rivals or {{he did not want to}} leave someone who knew a lot of his secrets alive. Leggio would later be tried twice for killing Scaglione but was acquitted for insufficient evidence.|$|E

At Drury Lane, in the {{following}} Italian season managed by George Wood, Santley sang The Dutchman in The Flying Dutchman (in Italian, as L'Ollandese Dannato), opposite di Murska, and with Signor Foli as Daland. This was the first presentation of a Wagner opera in London. It took place in July 1870. But several other promised productions <b>either</b> <b>did</b> not occur (Macbeth, Cherubini's Les Deux Journees, Rossini's Tancredi) or the baritone role in them was given to another artist.

25|$|In {{one study}} of Friends in Britain Yearly Meeting, around 30% of Quakers had views that were {{described}} as non-theistic, agnostic, or atheist. Another study of British Quakers, found that of the 727 members of the Religious Society of Friends who completed the survey, 75.1% said that they consider themselves to be Christian; 17.6% did not consider themselves Christian; and 7.3% of the members <b>either</b> <b>did</b> not answer or circled both answers. A further 22% of Quakers did not consider themselves to be a Christian, but fulfilled a definition of being a Christian in that {{they said that they}} devoutly followed the teachings and example of Jesus Christ.

25|$|The Transmobile was a {{monorail}} {{that would}} take riders from the base lodge, across Rt. 94 to the Cobblestone Village complex & Old Mill Mini Golf course, then to the Fest Haus Tents in Motorworld.

Rides to / from the Alpine Center were one way, and riders {{were not allowed to}} stay on the ride, and travel round-trip without getting off at either end.

25|$|Home Secretary David Blunkett {{ordered an}} inquiry into these revelations, chaired by Sir Michael Bichard, and later ordered the {{suspension}} of David Westwood, Chief of Humberside Police. The inquiry criticised Humberside Police for deleting information relating to previous allegations against Huntley and criticised Cambridgeshire Constabulary for not following vetting guidelines. An added complication in the vetting procedures {{was the fact that}} Huntley had applied for the caretaker's job under the name of Ian Nixon, although he did state on the application form that he was once known as Ian Huntley. It is believed that Humberside Police <b>either</b> <b>did</b> not check under the name Huntley on the police computer – if they had then they would have discovered a burglary charge left on file – or did not check either name.|$|E
