Tithonus indeed lived forever but grew ever older. In later tellings, Eos eventually {{turned him into a}} cricket to relieve him of such an existence. In the poem however, it is Eos, and not Zeus, who grants Tithonus immortality.|$|E

25|$|In 1536 Lady Kingston {{is said to}} {{have played}} a role in Mary Tudor's {{reconciliation}} with her father, and in his life of Mary Tudor, historian David Loades states that Lady Kingston had charge of a joint household for Henry VIII's daughters, Mary and Elizabeth, from March 1538 until April 1539. A letter <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> Thomas Wriothesley on 3 January 1538 advises of Mary's illness ('My Lady's Grace has been sick ever since Christmas'). Even after she was discharged from that position, Lady Kingston's continuing relationship with the King's elder daughter is attested to by gifts from her listed in Mary Tudor's privy purse accounts, including gifts of £4 in May 1540 and a gold spoon in January 1544.|$|E
25|$|Tickets for the American leg of {{the tour}} were {{available}} for pre-sale for members of Knowles' fan club on April 20, 2008 and the official tickets went on sale {{to the general public}} through Ticketmaster on April 25. In late May 2009, Knowles' label announced through a press release that the singer decided to set aside 2,000 seats for each date on her then-forthcoming North American tour at a discounted price of $20. After already selling 1,000 tickets per show for the special low price, the last 1,000 discounted seats for each show were made available to the public on May 29, 2009 through Ticketmaster (with the exception of the artist's four-night residency at the Encore at Wynn Las Vegas). Due to the big demand, Sony Music announced additional dates in England, Asia and South America. In May 2009, Knowles' official website was peppered with requests by disappointed fans — from Boston; Anchorage, Alaska; Tampa, Florida; St. Louis and Montreal — who asked <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come to their towns. The Daily Mail reported that the first European {{leg of the}} tour sold over 350,000 tickets for 32 shows; the UK part of the leg sold out completely with Knowles playing to over 100,000 fans.

500|$|Bunning's order {{also stated}} that Davis' deputy clerks must {{continue}} to comply with his earlier order to issue marriage licenses and to submit status reports to him every fourteen days confirming their compliance.

500|$|The film did not {{originally}} include circus scenes. Vasan {{decided to}} add them halfway through production, and the screenplay was changed. For {{the scene where}} Veerasimhan is freed from a cave by elephants, [...] "hundreds" [...] of circus elephants were used. Kittoo travelled throughout South India and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), seeing over 50 circuses before he chose the Kamala Circus Company and Parasuram Lion Circus; Vasan employed Kamala for a month. The circus scenes were shot by K. Ramnoth. Kittoo reminisced about the cinematographer's work:In those days, we had no zoom lenses and yet Ramnoth did it. One night, while Chandralekha is performing on the flying trapeze, she notices the villain's henchman in the front row. She is on her perch high up and he is seated in a ringside chair. Shock hits her and to convey the shock the camera zooms fast <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> the man. Today, with a fast zoom shot {{it can be done}} very easily, but there was no such lens forty years ago. Ramnoth did it using the crane. He planned it well and rehearsed the shot for long. He took the shot 20 times and selected the best [...] "take".|$|E

[...] They spent several days working on the song, with girl group Girls Aloud in mind as potential performers. [...] Warp Records and Simon Fuller of 19 Entertainment contacted Richard X by email to ask that he give the song to Geri Halliwell or Stevens, respectively, to record. He agreed to have Stevens record the song after Richard Curtis asked about using the song for Sport Relief 2004. Richard X later stated that he was surprised Sport Relief chose such a sexually suggestive song. When Halliwell {{found out that the}} writers were having Stevens record the song, she locked herself in her car in an attempt to change their minds, and she later wrote Richard X a love song. The aftermath of the decision for Stevens to record the song became the subject of another song written by Richard X and Robinson, [...] "Me Plus One" [...] from Annie's 2004 album Anniemal. While recording with Stevens, Richard X decided to get spoken soundbites <b>from</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make an extended version for the single's B-side. To fit the song's glam sound, he asked her questions about the Winter of Discontent, to which Stevens reacted with [...] "bemusement and terror." ...|$|E
