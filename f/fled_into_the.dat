5|$|Although Montcalm {{and other}} French {{officers}} attempted to stop further attacks, others did not, and some explicitly refused to provide further protection to the British. At this point, the column dissolved, as some {{tried to escape}} the Indian onslaught, while others actively tried to defend themselves. Massachusetts Colonel Joseph Frye reported that he was stripped of much of his clothing and repeatedly threatened. He <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods, and did not reach Fort Edward until 12 August.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the 9thcentury the Pechenegs {{controlled}} the territories to the east and south of the Carpathians. According to the Eymund's saga, they fought together with the Blökkumen ("Romanians") in the Kievan Rus' in the 1010s. The Pechenegs were swept aside from their territories by the Cumans between 1064 and 1078. A late variant of the oldest Turkish chronicle, the Oghuz-name relates that the Cumans defeated many nations, including the Ulâq ("Romanians"). Some of the Pechenegs <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of Hungary where they were employed to guard the border districts, for instance in Transylvania.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, Duyệt {{became a}} eunuch of the 18-year-old Prince Nguyễn Ánh, {{the nephew of}} the slain Nguyễn Lord and the most {{senior member of the}} family who survived the revolt by the three Tây Sơn brothers, who seized {{southern}} Vietnam from the Nguyễn in 1777. As a result, Nguyễn Ánh and a few loyalists <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> dense jungles of the Mekong Delta in the far south. Later, Nguyễn Ánh made Duyệt a Cai Cơ ("Commander") of his bodyguards. From 1777 onwards, the military balance between the Tây Sơn and the Nguyễn fluctuated, as the enemies counterattacked each other frequently.|$|E
5|$|Léopard {{had been}} {{selected}} to convince the Vichy government of La Réunion to join the Free French in June, but the collision and her consequent repairs delayed her mission. On the night of 27/28 November, she arrived off the island with 80 troops aboard. They were landed successfully and seized control of Saint-Denis, Réunion, the island's capital, although the governor <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> interior. A coast-defense battery engaged the contre-torpilleur and she fired back, with men killed on both sides. The Vichy hold-outs surrendered on the 30th and Léopard remained in the Indian Ocean escorting convoys until March 1943.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{responded to}} this outrage in a {{characteristically}} energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia {{at the head of}} a huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, who had participated in the attack on Cyprus. Thoros <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.|$|E

Baker and his brother-in-law brought the man to a store, where they were ambushed by the Anderson brothers. After a brief gunfight, Baker and his brother-in-law <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> store's basement. The Andersons barricaded {{the door to the}} basement and lit the store on fire, killing Baker and his brother-in-law. They also burnt Baker's home and stole two of his horses before returning to Missouri on the Santa Fe Trail.|$|E
5|$|The few Turks {{who survived}} the {{massacre}} <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> mountains, where the majority {{were killed by the}} local population. Ali, who spoke Romanian put on some peasant clothes and fled to Wallachia. Some 30,000 Turks died in the battle, whereas Báthory lost 8,000 Hungarians and some 2,000 Transylvanian Saxons and Transylvanian Wallachians. The two commanders feasted together with their troops, with Kinizsi dancing with a dead Turk as his companion.|$|E
5|$|When the French and Indian War {{began in}} 1754 {{as part of}} the Seven Years' War, Franklin {{recruited}} militias. During the war, the city attracted many refugees from the western frontier. When Pontiac's Rebellion occurred in 1763, refugees again <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city, including a group of Lenape hiding from other Native Americans, angry at their pacifism, and white frontiersmen. The Paxton Boys tried to follow them into Philadelphia for attacks, but was prevented by the city's militia and Franklin, who convinced them to leave.|$|E

5|$|Acoli {{then drove}} the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which {{contained}} Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who was dead or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol {{cars and the}} booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police helicopters, and bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur's {{body was found in}} a nearby gully along the road.|$|E
5|$|All six LSTs were {{unloaded}} by 11:45. There {{was little}} opposition. Eleven Japanese {{soldiers were killed}} by the naval bombardment or assault troops. Perhaps as many as 150 transient Japanese troops were in the Saidor area, all of whom <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> interior. American casualties {{on the day of the}} landing came to one soldier killed and five wounded, and two sailors drowned. Nine Japanese Nakajima Ki-49 (Helen) aircraft, escorted by up to twenty A6M Zero (Zeke) and Kawasaki Ki-61 (Tony) fighters bombed the beach area at 1630. There were three more air raids during the night, and 49 over the course of the month, but most were small.|$|E
5|$|Discharging {{most of the}} {{remaining}} escort, Breckinridge left Washington with a small party on May 5, hoping to distract federal forces from the fleeing Confederate president. Between Washington and Woodstock, the party was overtaken by Union forces under Lieutenant Colonel Andrew K. Campbell; Breckinridge ordered his nephew to surrender while he, his sons Cabell and Clifton, James B. Clay, Jr., and a few others <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> nearby woods. At Sandersville, he sent Clay and Clifton home, announcing that he {{and the rest of his}} companions would proceed to Madison, Florida. On May 11, they reached Milltown, Georgia, where Breckinridge expected to rendezvous with Davis, but on May 14, he learned of Davis's capture days earlier.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, the Byzantine {{right and}} centre had been {{engaging}} in skirmishes with the Normans opposite them. However, {{with the collapse}} of the Norman right, the knights were in danger of being outflanked. At this point, the Varangians (mainly Anglo-Saxons who had left England after the Norman Conquest) joined in the pursuit of the Norman right. With their massive battle axes, the Varangians attacked the Norman knights, who were driven away after their horses panicked. The Varangians soon became separated from the main force and exhausted so they were in no position to resist an assault. Guiscard sent a strong force of spearmen and crossbowmen against the Varangian flank and inflicted heavy casualties on them. The few remaining Varangians <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> church of the Archangel Michael. The Normans immediately set the church on fire, and all Varangians perished in the blaze.|$|E
5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van Tassel houses, they trapped Cornelius Van Tassel Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|Somerset {{played an}} {{important}} part in defeating the spread of the Danes in the 9th century. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle records that in 845 Alderman Eanwulf, with the men of Somersetshire (Sumorsǣte), and Bishop Ealstan, and Alderman Osric, with the men of Dorsetshire, conquered the Danish army {{at the mouth of the}} Parret. This was the first known use of the name Somersæte. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that in January 878 the King Alfred the Great <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> marshes of Somerset from the Viking's invasion and made a fort at Athelney. From the fort Alfred was able to organize an resistance using the local militias from Somerset, Wiltshire and Hampshire.|$|E

5|$|The British {{moved the}} capital to New Delhi in 1911. Calcutta {{continued}} to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement. The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944, during World War II. Coinciding with the war, millions starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 due to a combination of military, administrative, and natural factors. Demands {{for the creation of a}} Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of communal violence that killed over 4,000. The partition of India led to further clashes and a demographic shift—many Muslims left for East Pakistan (present day Bangladesh), while hundreds of thousands of Hindus <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> city.|$|E
5|$|The Indians were {{a harder}} fight; {{they were out}} of the main field of battle, skirmishing on the edge of an {{adjacent}} swamp. Richard Johnson eventually ordered a suicide squad of twenty men to ride forward and draw the Indians' fire, planning to charge with the rest as they reloaded. But the ground before the Indian position was too swampy to support many cavalry. Johnson had to order his men to dismount and hold until Shelby's infantry came up. But eventually they broke, and <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> swamp, during which time Tecumseh was slain, some say by Johnson, others believing it was someone else.|$|E
5|$|The jubilation {{with which}} Greeks had hailed their king at the {{beginning}} of the war was reversed in defeat. For a time, he considered abdication. It was not until the King faced down an assassination attempt on 27 February 1898 with great bravery that his subjects again held their monarch in high esteem. Returning from a trip to the beach at Phaleron in an open carriage, George and his daughter Maria were shot at by two riflemen. The King tried to shield his daughter; both were unhurt though the coachman and a horse were wounded. The gunmen (an Athens clerk called Karditzis and his assistant) <b>fled</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Hymettus hills but they were spotted and arrested. Both were beheaded at Nauplia.|$|E
