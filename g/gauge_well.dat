40|$|Why {{worry about}} numerics given {{so many other}} problems? Hydrologists often face sources of {{uncertainty}} that dwarf those normally encountered in many engineering and scientific disciplines. While a structural engineer designing a wall of a building can subject multiple bricks to repeated strength tests and simulate the full non-linear behaviour of individual bricks, joints and reinforcing bars using finite element models applied at the scale of millimetres, we as hydrologists often represent highly heterogeneous catchment systems, which may include complex stream networks, preferential flowpaths, varied vegetation, land use and geology, using highly conceptualized lumped models. Moreover, we often force these models with rainfall data from a single, daily recording <b>gauge</b> <b>well</b> outside of the catchment. Given the simplicity of our models, {{does it really matter}} how they are implemented...|$|E

40|$|Measuring {{sea level}} {{has been of}} {{interest}} in Sweden since {{the discovery of the}} land uplift and today one reason for measurements is the current climate change. By accurately measuring the sea level, vulnerable coastlines can be detected at an early stage and appropriate measures can be taken. The two types of sensors, radar and pneumatic bubbler gauge, that are mounted at the tide <b>gauge</b> <b>well</b> at Onsala Space Observatory both have a best case measurement uncertainty of 3 mm. This report will study another method based on an optical distance sensor, a laser, that will be a complement to the other two. Before an implementation of such an optical distance sensor the devices accuracy have to be examined. Given the specifications of the wells dimensions measurements related to repeatability, linearity and temperature depence will be carried out. The report conclude that an optical distance sensor has the smallest standard deviation of the three sensors, based on an experiment lasting slighly longer than one day, and that no significant temperature dependence can be found. The laser will sample the reflected light from a reflector that floats on the water surface. Calculations show that this reflector has insignificant impact on the total measurement accuracy. Therefore an optical distance sensor is a useful alternative to the already mounted sensors at Onsala Space Observatory for measuring the sea level...|$|E
40|$|The Permanent Downhole Gauge (PDG) {{can monitor}} the {{reservoir}} {{in real time}} {{over a long period}} of time. This produces a huge amount of real time data which can potentially provide more information about wells and reservoirs. However, processing large numbers of data and extracting useful information from these data brings new challenges for industry and engineers. A new workflow for processing the PDG data is proposed in this study. The new approach processes PDG data from the view of <b>gauge,</b> <b>well</b> and reservoir. The gauge information is first filtered with data preprocessing and outlier removal. Then, the well event is identified using an improved wavelet approach. The further processing step of data denoise and data reduction is carried out before analyzing the reservoir information. The accurate production history is very essential for data analysis. However, the accurate production rate is hard to be acquired. Therefore, a new approach is created to recover flow rate history from the accumulated production and PDG pressure data. This new approach is based on the theory that the relation between production rate and the amplitude of detail coefficient are in direct proportion after wavelet transform. With accurate pressure and rate data, traditional well testing is applied to analyze the PDG pressure data to get dynamic reservoir parameters. The numerical well testing approach is also carried out to analyze more complex reservoir model with a new toolbox. However, these two approaches all suffer from the nonlinear problem of PDG pressure. So, a dynamic forward modelling approach is proposed to analyze PDG pressure data. The new approach uses the deconvolution method to diagnose the linear region in the nonlinear system. The nonlinear system can be divided into different linear systems which can be analyzed with the numerical well testing approach. Finally, a toolbox which includes a PDG data processing module and PDG data analysis module is designed with Matlab. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Observations of long-period ocean waves {{have been}} carried out at Miyagi-Enoshima on the {{north-eastern}} coast of Japan for a long time. For tsunami study, however, it is necessary to have observation points similar to Enoshima at several places in the Pacific coast of Japan, and as a realization of this plan, the Izu-Oshima Tsunami Observatory was established in September 1960. This observatory stands at Senzu, the north-eastern part of Oshima, a volcanic island situated on the Izu-Marianne ridge which separates the Philippine Sea from the Pacific Ocean. The observatory is therefore situated at a favorable position to record tsunamis originating both from the NE and SW parts of Honshu Island of Japan. The observatory includes an observation house made of concrete blocks and a <b>gauge</b> <b>well</b> built on lava of Mt. Mihara projecting into the sea. In the observatory are installed the ERI-IV tsunami recorder, a microbarograph and a microseismograph, as shown in Table 1. Tsunamis have not yet been observed, but spectra of records in different meteorological conditions were obtained to investigate the features of the background noise constantly observable in the records of the tsunami recorder. The spectral analyses were made by the wave analyser specially constructed for studies of the tsunami spectra. The following features were known by the present spectral analyses. 1. When typhoon 6124 approached Oshima island and sea and swell became heavy, the tsunami recorder recorded prominently 1 to 2 minute waves. As heights of this 1 - 2 minute waves have a good correlation with wind velocities, they may be the "surf beat" named by Munk. 2. The spectra of the records were obtained for the following four cases. (1) Oct. 8 - 9, 1961, when typhoon 6124 was approaching. (2) May 14 - 15, 1961, when a small depression was passing along the southern coast of Honshu Island. (3) Dec. 25 - 26, 1961, when a monsoon wind was blowing. (4) May 4 - 5, 1961, when a depression was passing through the Japan sea. In the first and second cases when wind waves were very rough off the coast of Senzu, the parts of the spectrum of the period shorter than 12 to 18 minutes are about twice as large as the parts of longer period. On the other hand, in the third and fourth cases when the sea off the coast of Senzu was rather calm, the spectra are flat extending over the whole period band. Therefore, it is supposed that the short period components of spectra relate to the activity of the sea just adjoining the coast. In the latter two cases, another remarkable fact is that the sea level fluctuations of the period longer than 60 minutes increased later to the greatest energy. 3. The predominant period of 11 to 12 minutes was recorded in each spectrum, which may be explained as being due to the island seich of this island. 4. In every case stated above, there is a striking fact that all spectra have a minimum at about 40 minutes in period. If we assume the mouth of Sagami Bay to be the line connecting Oshima and Boso peninsula, the natural period of the bay will be 38 minutes. The fact that a spectrum of the tide gauge record at Ito on the coast of Sagami Bay shows a peak of 42 minutes will be in favor of this assumption. If there is such a resonator it is only reasonable that the amplitude of the sea level fluctuations near Oshima is attenuated at the period of the free oscillation of Sagami Bay. The minimum point of the spectrum mentioned above {{may be the result of}} this effect. 5. A spectrum of the microbarograph record obtained at Oshima is hardly similar to that of the tsunami recorder, even when the microbarograph has recorded fair and regular waves. This fact shows that the long-period sea level fluctuations have little relation with the microbarometric disturbances at this island...|$|E

40|$|Research on {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} changes of hydrological elements of the environment {{is an important issue}} of most emerging tasks due to the possible trends of the climate change. In this study we investigated a catchment (Canal Lónyay-főcsatorna) whichwas situated on the northeastern part of Hungary, in the Nyírségmezoregion. We examined some characteristic features of the hydrological elements (precipitation, surface and ground water). To achieve our aims, data measured in hydro-meteorological stations and groundwater <b>gauging</b> <b>wells</b> between 1950 - 2005, as well as data measured in water-gauges between 1980 - 2005 were used. We analysed the datasetwith statistical and GIS methods and we illustrated the results on maps and diagrams. About 540 - 650 mm precipitation was measured on the watershed of Lónyay canal. The effect of the relief was identified in the regional distribution of precipitation. According to the minimum precipitation map, the driest region was the southwestern part of the Lónyay-watershed area. This fact was the consequence of the relative location of the area in a basin (Carpathian Basin with the surrounding mountains). According to our observations the anthropogenic effects presumably does not exceed the influences of natural processes.
