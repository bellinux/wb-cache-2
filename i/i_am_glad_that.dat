500|$|In the report, Rahall did not {{directly}} criticize the court, but Don Young of Alaska, the committee's ranking member, did. In a section for additional views {{at the end of}} the report, he called the Ninth Circuit's decision [...] "mistaken." [...] The KD IIs action [...] "was clearly a violation of the Act, but the court ruled otherwise," [...] he wrote. [...] "The court was clearly wrong in their decision and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> we are overriding the court decision in this case." ...|$|E
500|$|... According to Muttahida Qaumi Movement senator Babar Khan Ghauri, [...] "This is a commendable {{decision}} by the government. We have been repeatedly telling the current government that instead of engaging the terrorists in dialogue, government should act against these elements. Karachi {{has a number of}} terrorists and it might suffer from a blow back; this should be tackled so Karachi does not have to suffer on account of this." [...] MQM head Altaf Hussain said, [...] "I welcome this operation and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> government is supporting the armed forces, those who have not backed the operation must realize that {{it is a matter of}} national security. I appeal to them to come on same page by setting aside their political compulsions." [...] he said.|$|E

500|$|Johnson had {{the matter}} investigated, and after having Cobb's September 24 doubleheader {{statistics}} re-checked, discovered {{only the first}} game of Cobb's statistics had been scored, but not the second game, in which he went 2-for-3. This put Cobb's suggested actual batting average at [...]385, again ahead of Lajoie's. In the end, Johnson ruled that Lajoie's sacrifice bunt should have been recorded as a hit (which would have allowed him to go 9-for-9) but that Cobb's batting average was greater, recording 196 hits in 509 at bats to Lajoie's 227 hits in 591 at bats. Johnson asked Chalmers if his company would award an automobile to each player, to which he agreed. Initially Lajoie refused the car but eventually relented and accepted it. Cobb said, [...] "I am glad that I won an automobile and am especially pleased that Lajoie also gets one. I have no one to criticize. I know the games were on the square and I am greatly pleased to know that the affair has ended so nicely." [...] Lajoie said, [...] "I am quite satisfied that I was treated fairly in every way by President Johnson, but I think the scorer at St. Louis made an error in not crediting me with nine hits. However, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> the controversy is over. I have the greatest respect for Cobb as a batter and am glad of his success." ...|$|E

"I devoured Lamark... his {{theories}} delighted me... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> {{he has been}} courageous enough and logical enough to admit that his argument, if pushed {{as far as it}} must go, if worth anything, would prove that men may have come from the Ourang-Outang.

2500|$|Hava Inbar, a lawyer, was {{appointed}} the {{judge of the}} military court in Haifa in September 1969, thus becoming the first female military judge in the world.

2500|$|Howard's {{abilities}} and powerful physique have drawn attention from fellow NBA All-Stars. Tim Duncan once remarked in 2007: [...] " [...] is so developed... He {{has so much}} promise and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> I {{will be out of}} the league when he is peaking." [...] Kevin Garnett echoed those sentiments: [...] " [...] is a freak of nature, man... I was nowhere near that physically talented. I wasn't that gifted, as far as body and physical presence." [...] Subsequent to a game in the 2009 NBA Playoffs, Philadelphia 76ers swingman Andre Iguodala said: [...] "It's like he can guard two guys at once. He can guard his guy and the guy coming off the pick-and-roll, which is almost impossible to do... If he gets any more athletic or jumps any higher, they're {{going to have to change}} the rules." [...] As early as December 2007, ESPN writer David Thorpe declared Howard to be the most dominant center in the NBA.|$|E
2500|$|The 1909 {{season was}} played under changed rules. The rule changes for 1909 {{included}} reducing {{the value of}} a field goal (whether by drop kick or place kick) from four points to three points. [...] Michigan's Board in Control of Athletics also re-established a freshman football team in 1909 after the freshman football program had been ceased four years earlier. [...] Michigan head coach Fielding H. Yost said at the time, [...] "It is to the freshmen that we must look for our future Michigan teams and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> it has been decided to allow us to have such a team. [...] Under competent coaching such as they will have the men will learn a lot about the Michigan style of playing and this will be invaluable when they come up for the Varsity team in future years." [...] Prentiss Douglass was hired as the coach of the freshman team, and he led the freshman to a 5-0 record.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 April 2017, Mallya {{was arrested}} by the UK Metropolitan Police {{extradition}} unit [...] "on behalf of the Indian authorities in relation to accusations of fraud", and he was then released on bail pending further consideration of the case. On 9 May 2017, the Supreme Court of India found Mallya guilty of contempt of court and summoned him to appear on 10 July. When he failed to appear, the Supreme Court said the contempt case would only proceed further after he is produced before the court. Mallya dismissed the proceedings against him – calling the situation a [...] "witch hunt". He said [...] "I have done absolutely nothing wrong. In fact <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>glad</b> <b>that</b> it is finally before a UK court and an impartial court. So we wait {{and see how it}} plays out." [...] In the meantime, he is not allowed to leave Britain, but he said that is no hardship for him. He said [...] "There's nothing to miss" [...] for him about India, since his immediate family has all moved to England or the United States.|$|E
