5|$|Another common {{condition}} is otitis externa (outer ear infections), which {{is common to}} a variety of spaniels, as the long floppy ears trap moisture, making them more prone to recurrent infections than <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> more upright ears. The infections can be caused by a variety of reasons including mites, ear fungi and generally dirt and germs. Treatment is relatively simple and can range from prescribed antibiotics to over-the-counter ear cleaning liquids.|$|E
5|$|Blunt-Lytton {{documented}} her {{attempts in}} the early 20th century to re-breed the 18th-century type of King Charles Spaniel {{as seen in the}} portraits of King Charles II. She used the Toy Trawler Spaniel, a curly haired, mostly black, small to medium-sized spaniel, and cross-bred these <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> a variety of other breeds, including Blenheim Spaniels and Cocker Spaniels, in unsuccessful attempts to reproduce the earlier style.|$|E
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in <b>dogs,</b> <b>with</b> prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E

5|$|The Alpine Spaniel {{was one of}} {{the direct}} genetic {{progenitors}} to the St. Bernard. Starting in 1830, the monks and canons of the Swiss Alps began crossing the <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> the Newfoundland, expecting that the resulting offspring would have the longer hair of the Newfoundland and this would protect the dogs better from the cold. Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that the dogs were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E
5|$|The Welsh Springer is {{generally}} a healthy breed, but some can suffer conditions common to many breeds such as hip dysplasia, Canine glaucoma and like other <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> pendulous ears, they {{are prone to}} ear infections such as otitis externa. In a survey of over a hundred breeds of dog conducted in 1997, the Welsh Springer Spaniel was ranked 14th for worst hip score, with the average score of the breed being 18.45. The average lifespan is 12 to 15 years.|$|E

The Kalmyk people near the Caspian Sea were known to frequently cross their <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> jackals, and Balkan shepherds once crossed their sheepdogs with jackals.|$|E

Reaching a vault is always possible with enough skill; the game forces players to escape their own traps before other players can access them. Being caught in one's own traps has the same consequence as any other trap in the game: permadeath.|$|E
5|$|Hip and elbow {{dysplasia}} are common. Giant Schnauzers {{are also}} prone to eye {{problems such as}} keratoconjunctivitis sicca, glaucoma, cataracts, multifocal retinal dysplasia, and generalized progressive retinal atrophy. They are also prone to skin diseases, such as seasonal flank alopecia, vitiligo, and follicular cysts. Cancer of the skin is common in dark-colored <b>dogs,</b> <b>with</b> the most frequently occurring varieties being melanoma of the limbs and digits, and squamous cell carcinoma of the digit. This susceptibility occurs because melanoma {{is caused by a}} defect in the melanocytes, the cells that darken the color of the skin. Noncancerous skin tumors are also common.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s a {{veterinarian}} in Santa Rosa, California, Jack Woolsey, {{was introduced to}} Lougher's <b>dogs.</b> <b>With</b> his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in Western Horsemen stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including Oaklea Blue Ace, Glen Iris Boomerang and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.|$|E

Lassie {{was associated with the}} wholesome family values of its period but some parents' groups monitoring television content found cliffhanger plots showing children in danger too intense for very young viewers and objected to some of Timmy's actions which were believed to encourage children to disobey parents. However, Lassie was consistently depicted as caring, nurturing, and responsible with a commitment to family and community, often rescuing those in peril and righting wrongs. She was the perfect 'mother' within the American ideology of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Saluki was {{historically}} bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated. Images {{of running}} <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> long, narrow bodies adorn pottery found in Susa {{that dates back}} to 6,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia, with one writer suggesting that these might depict the ancestor of the Saluki, despite the depictions bearing erect, pointed ears. Salukis and Greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom (2134 BC–1785 BC) onward, however it was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to prominence, replacing the Tesem (thought to be similar to modern Pariah dogs or a generic term for a dog) in ancient Egyptian art. The breed spread southward into the Sudan.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers <b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, {{it is understandable that}} the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.|$|E

5|$|Tracks are an {{important}} factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation. Coyote tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact than those of domestic dogs, and their claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of <b>dogs.</b> <b>With</b> the exception of sighthounds, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride. Coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by less damage to the underlying tissues in the former. Also, coyote scat tends to be smaller than wolf scat.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} become {{recognised}} fully by the American Kennel Club, they must first compete in a Miscellaneous Class. The requirements to compete in that class are to demonstrate a following by having a minimum of 100 active members in a national breed club, a population of 300 to 400 <b>dogs,</b> <b>with</b> third generation pedigrees and for all dogs in those pedigrees {{to be of the}} same breed, a distribution across twenty or more states, and the breed standard must be reviewed and approved by the AKC. Currently there are five dogs in the AKC's Miscellaneous Class which are Dogue de Bordeaux, Redbone Coonhound, Irish Red and White Setter, Norwegian Buhund and Pyrenean Shepherd. Typical stays in that class are between one and three years, and the national club of the breed must have held seminars, shows and judges workshops prior to being fully recognised.|$|E
