She finds all of her friends that she just left to also be their teenage selves, not just her. Still in shock, she allows herself to be taken home while she sees her surroundings are the way they were 25 years before.

25|$|Portal {{had been}} under {{development}} for about a year, at a state where there were only test chambers that the player moved between. Valve found from playtesting that while players had <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game's concept, they were left asking of where these puzzles were leading towards. The team worked {{to come up with}} some type of narrative, coming down to creating an antagonist that would guide the player in early part of the game but become the goal that the player would strive for by the end. The creation of GLaDOS to serve this purpose began with a discussion between the Valve team and Wolpaw on the narrative constraints they had to deal with. When they were designing the game, they found that they did not have enough time or staffing to use human characters, due to the amount of animation work and scene choreography involved.|$|E

25|$|Lancashire Lightning {{recorded}} the most emphatic victory by {{runs in the}} 2005 Twenty20 season, as they had <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Yorkshire Phoenix bowlers. After being put in to bat, Mal Loye and Stuart Law put on 106 for the first wicket, and when Loye departed for 47 Brad Hodge followed up with a 17-ball 33, a partnership of 77 with Law. Despite Ian Harvey digging into them with two wickets, the early run-rate ensured that Lancashire set a target of 208, Law recording the second Twenty20 century this season - in 56 balls. Ian Harvey, {{the man responsible for}} the first of those centuries, was out early for 1, and wickets fell to everyone as Yorkshire were out for 97 - Dominic Cork taking three for 10, Muttiah Muralitharan three for 17, and James Anderson two for 26.

[...] He felt the pace and storyline issues in [...] "Legends of Tomorrrow," [...] the Flash episode, were {{resolved}} satisfactorily. [...] The inclusion of flashbacks and time travel gave it [...] "a larger scope and an added sense of drama".

Alisdair Wilkins awarded the episode a B+ noting [...] "how much better the show's entire dynamic is this season compared with last year".

500|$|Game Arts's {{presence}} on the project, however, {{was more of a}} supervisory role. [...] Project Sylpheed was conceived and developed by SETA's Ikusabune team, which comprised former Game Arts employees who had worked on the Silpheed series. [...] The team intended to use the latest technology at the time to produce a sequel to Silpheed. [...] The new game would allow player characters to move anywhere in a three-dimensional playing arena, instead of restricting them to fixed paths as in standard rail shooters. [...] Computer graphics studio, Anima, was brought in to develop the game's story and characters, creating the animated cut scenes that are interspersed among the missions. [...] The product of this collaboration was showcased at Tokyo Game Show 2006; [...] journalists had <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> space shooter, commenting that its controls and learning curve were simpler than those of space flight simulators.|$|E

500|$|Following script rewrites, Cherry {{pitched the}} series to ABC, who {{picked up the}} pilot. ABC {{executives}} were, however, concerned about {{the title of the}} series, which Cherry had selected before even writing the script. They suggested renaming the series Wisteria Lane or The Secret Lives of Housewives, but Cherry insisted on keeping the original title. He later commented, [...] "I put 'desperate' [...] to try to indicate, however subtly... I'm going to have some <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> imagery, to take it to some interesting places. Most critics got the joke. Some people see the word 'housewives' and it pushes a button in them and they seem to lose all reason." [...] The project was officially announced on October 23, 2003 as a cross between American Beauty and Knots Landing. While Desperate Housewives, along with fellow new series Grey's Anatomy and Lost, would later help reverse ABC's flagging fortune, network executives Lloyd Braun and Susan Lyne were fired shortly after greenlighting these risky and expensive pilots.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Cindy White {{praised the}} writing for Deangelo's character saying that [...] "Ferrell {{is much better}} carrying the show on his own than being second banana to Carell. It seemed like he was having more <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> role in this episode". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.0/10. New Yorks Phoebe Reilly wrote that [...] "while {{it was nice to}} see the staff responding to someone new, it didn't feel like enough to make an audience antsy to come back after a long summer." [...] Hillary Busis of Entertainment Weekly also gave the episode a mediocre review commenting that [...] "judging by tonight's episode alone, the transition from the Carell era to the post-Carell era is going to be shaky, to say the least". [...] "The Inner Circle" [...] was voted the fourth lowest-rated episode out of 24 from the seventh season, according to an episode poll at the fansite OfficeTally.

500|$|Cranston's {{performance}} {{was a frequent}} topic in the critiques. Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive {{when you consider that}} he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants the hint of suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also having a lot of <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> jokes. It’s a nice reminder of just how funny Cranston can be, and I hope he gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week." [...] Jonah Gardner of Ology later said, [...] "Bryan Cranston remains a god among men." ...|$|E

500|$|The Sea of Monsters {{received}} generally positive reviews with reviewers {{praising the}} storyline, the themes and the author's style of writing. [...] "In a feat worthy of his heroic subjects, Riordan crafts a sequel stronger than his compelling debut," [...] said a Publishers Weekly review. School Library Journal singled out the novel's plot and main character, stating, [...] "Percy is an appealing kid, {{and the subject}} of a chilling prophecy may resonate with readers." [...] Child magazine wrote, [...] "Featuring the cliff-hangers and sassy attitude kids loved in The Lightning Thief – plus a surprising new family secret – this outstanding sequel should win over a fresh legion of fans." [...] Children's Literature called the writing extraordinary and added, [...] "This book, sequel to The Lightning Thief, is an amazing mixture of mythology and young adult fiction." [...] Matt Berman, of Common Sense Media, praised the book, saying [...] "The Percy Jackson series continues to be pure <b>fun,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> author doing nearly everything right to produce a book that few kids will be able to resist."

500|$|Fox {{issued a}} press release on January 11 {{previewing}} the episode's plot. It concluded, [...] "While the girl's mind-bending condition intensifies, Walter dusts off some old lab videos and hypothesizes the unthinkable, sending Olivia and Peter to investigate the bewildering case in an original 'Unearthed' episode of Fringe and here's another mystery: is it an unaired episode from Season One or is it from an alternate universe?" [...] As the press release purposely alluded to whether the episode was indeed originally {{part of the first}} season or from the parallel universe, one critic wrote that [...] "FOX [...] having <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fact that Fringe has alternate universes" [...] and that readers of the press release should [...] "take this with a grain of salt". According to Fox's media site, [...] "Unearthed" [...] was listed as the 21st episode of season one, despite its broadcast during the second season and inclusion in that season's DVD release as a special feature. Though one character had been killed off earlier in the second season, a former series regular appeared in the episode, sparking confusion among some viewers. As the broadcasting change went unexplained at the time, one media outlet speculated it was a marketing ploy on the network's part, believing the episode title was [...] "more than a stunning coincidence" [...] and that it was a reference to co-creator J.J. Abrams' other television series, Lost.|$|E
500|$|A few {{critics were}} {{negative}} about Metroid Prime Pinball. The reviewer from the Electronic Gaming Monthly video game magazine {{found it hard}} to see the pinball while playing the game, especially when it was in the area between the top and bottom Nintendo DS screens. With a limited selection of game modes, GamePros Rice Burner was disappointed with the game, and concluded that because every game mode features the same tabletops, Metroid Prime Pinball lacked variety, which Game Informers reviewer agreed with, noting that he would have had more <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> game if he [...] "had access to a little more content". The minigames were criticized by Game Revolution, which claimed that there were too many minigames that were only of average quality. Furthermore, it asked the game's developer, Fuse Games, to spend more time making a great pinball game rather than several minor minigames, requesting [...] "a character-based game that's great at pinball rather than a fence-riding jack of all trades that is master of none". Eurogamer had a different experience, finding that the minigames provided more entertainment than the main game, which they remarked was a [...] "cardinal sin in pinball". They also criticized the tilt feature for being unintuitive and difficult to use. The reviewer for GamesMaster felt that Metroid Prime Pinball was directed more towards Metroid fans than pinball aficionados, calling it a [...] "flashy but insipid" [...] game.|$|E
