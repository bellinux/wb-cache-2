30|$|AWS-ETI {{performance}} and easiness could probably {{be explained by}} its technical features. First, the disposable AWS blade is anatomically designed {{to conform to the}} shape of the mouth and pharynx and to pass over the tongue dorsum, with the minimal displacement of soft tissues. Second, unlike the DLM, the AWS does not require alignment of the oral, pharyngeal and tracheal axes to visualize the vocal cords [18]. Third, once inserted into the mouth, the AWS requires minimal adjustment of its position, whereas the DLM requires coordinated movements to expose the glottis [21, 24]. Fourth, imposed by the anatomic shape of the blade, epiglottis loading with the AWS blade tip allows to get the best glottis view to perform reliable ETI. By contrast, the DLM-ETI does not require epiglottis loading, but the blade tip must be placed into the <b>glossoepiglottic</b> <b>fold</b> in order to tract epiglottis and getting direct view of the glottis space [28]. This technical features, notably the need for loading the epiglottis or not, could explain in part the difference between both devices regarding ETI performance such as handling and the risk of adverse events or injuries. Therefore, the entire ETI procedure being performed under visual control with the AWS monitor, ETI could be more secured and supervised.|$|E
25|$|The {{anterior}} tongue is, at its apex (or tip), {{thin and}} narrow, it is directed forward against the lingual {{surfaces of the}} lower incisor teeth. The posterior part is, at its root, directed backward, and connected with the hyoid bone by the hyoglossi and genioglossi muscles and the hyoglossal membrane, with the epiglottis by three <b>glossoepiglottic</b> <b>folds</b> of mucous membrane, with the soft palate by the glossopalatine arches, and with the pharynx by the superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle and the mucous membrane. It also forms the anterior wall of the oropharynx.|$|R
2500|$|The {{oropharynx}} {{lies between}} the mouth (oral cavity) to the front, and the laryngopharynx below, which [...] separates {{it from the}} larynx. The upper limit of the oropharynx is marked by the soft palate, and its lower limit by the epiglottis and root of the tongue. The oropharynx communicates with the mouth, in front through {{what is known as}} the oropharyngeal isthmus, or isthmus of the fauces. The isthmus (i.e. connection) is formed above by the soft palate, below by the posterior third of the tongue, and at the sides by the palatoglossal arches. The posterior third of the tongue, or tongue base contains numerous follicles of lymphatic tissue that form the lingual tonsils. Adjacent to the tongue base, the lingual surface of the epiglottis, which curves forward, is attached to the tongue by median and lateral <b>glossoepiglottic</b> <b>folds.</b> The folds form small troughs known as the epiglottic valleculae. The lateral walls are marked by two vertical pillars on each side, the pillars of the fauces, or palatoglossal arches. More properly they are separately named the palatoglossal arch anteriorly and the palatopharyngeal arch posteriorly. The anterior arch is named from the palatoglossal muscle within, running from the soft palate to the tongue [...] (glossus), while the posterior arch similarly contains the palatopharyngeal muscle running from the soft palate to the lateral pharynx. Between the arches lies a triangular space, the tonsillar fossa in which lies the palatine tonsil, another lymphoid organ.|$|R
