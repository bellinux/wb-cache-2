5|$|Young {{began the}} season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> {{after failing to}} win {{a spot in the}} Kansas City rotation. On June 23, 2017, Young was {{designated}} for assignment by the Royals. He was immediately released.|$|E
5|$|After making three rehab {{starts in}} Wichita, Affeldt {{returned}} to the Royals on August 2 and threw a perfect inning against the Minnesota Twins. He remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> {{for the remainder of}} the 2002 season. After the season, he pitched in a winter league in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to try to fix his blister problems. The move was {{originally}} thought to be temporary. While <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen,</b> on August 3, he got his career first save in a 20 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 21, the Royals announced that Affeldt would {{spend the rest of the}} year <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen.</b> Two days later, he got another save against Minnesota. He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his blister problems, he had part of a fingernail on the middle finger of his left hand removed. Also, the Royals announced that if he developed blister problems again, he would be sent to the bullpen for good.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bullpens</b> {{are located}} along (and close to) {{the left and}} right field foul lines and there are no {{barriers}} that separate them from the field of play. In fact, fly balls hit into <b>the</b> <b>bullpens</b> are <b>in</b> play. <b>The</b> <b>bullpen</b> players and <b>the</b> pitching mounds are obstacles for fielders chasing fly balls into the pen. Teams have to station a batboy behind <b>the</b> catchers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpens</b> to prevent them from being hit by foul balls from behind. This style of bullpen used to be common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Major Leagues, and is still in use in 2 other stadiums.|$|R
50|$|In 2014, Cincinnati Reds Pitcher JJ Hoover {{used this}} song as his walk in song when coming <b>in</b> from <b>the</b> <b>bullpen.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> 38th Meiji Jingu Tournament that followed, {{he started}} all three games, leading Waseda to a match-up with Toyo University <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tournament finals on November 14. However, though he pitched six shutout frames and matched Toyo's ace (and current Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks pitcher) Shota Ohba <b>inning</b> for <b>inning,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> gave up <b>the</b> go-ahead run after Saito left {{the game and}} Waseda fell {{just short of the}} tournament championship.|$|R
5|$|As spring {{training}} 2015 began, Hollands {{noted that he}} was not taking a spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> for granted, and that he expected to compete with several other lefties. During {{spring training}}, he strained the common flexor tendon in his throwing arm. He underwent Tommy John surgery in April, and missed the 2015 season. After completing a rehabilitation assignment, the Phillies optioned Hollands to Lehigh Valley on June 2, 2016. He was released on May 20, 2017.|$|E
5|$|On July 6, 2010 at Miller Park, in a 6-1 {{win over}} the Milwaukee Brewers, Bumgarner earned his first career victory by going eight innings without {{yielding}} a run. Bumgarner pitched well enough that when Wellemeyer returned from the disabled list in August, Giants' manager Bruce Bochy chose to use him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> and leave Bumgarner in the rotation.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{returned}} to Kansas City's starting rotation in 2006 {{when he was}} named the fourth starter during Spring training. However, he was moved up to the third spot before the season began when Runelvys Hernández was demoted to the fifth spot. Affeldt struggled as a starter, going 25 with a 7.80 ERA in nine starts. His final major league start came on May 27 against the New York Yankees. He gave up ten runs on eleven hits in a 154 loss. After the start, {{he was sent to}} the bullpen, and Bobby Keppel filled his place in the starting rotation. Affeldt improved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen,</b> posting a 2.91 ERA there through July 31.|$|E
50|$|Hammond {{replaced}} the incumbent Mike Stanton as the left-handed setup man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yankees' <b>bullpen.</b> Joe Torre {{tried to use}} Hammond as a left-handed specialist because <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> lacked other left-handed pitchers. Hammond allowed the lowest percentage of inherited runners to score <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2003 Yankees <b>bullpen</b> while posting a 2.86 ERA. He only had one appearance during the 2003 postseason, pitching two innings without allowing an earned run during the World Series while facing the Marlins.|$|R
50|$|After {{beginning}} <b>the</b> season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indians <b>bullpen,</b> Westbrook {{earned a}} spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Indians rotation <b>in</b> late May.|$|R
50|$|On July 23, 1964, Campy Campaneris, was {{introduced}} on air by Monte Moore, announcer, by explaining a promotional gimmick by Charlie O. Finley, of Campy riding a donkey <b>in</b> from <b>the</b> <b>bullpen.</b>|$|R
5|$|Affeldt's time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> did {{not last}} long. On May 3, he {{replaced}} Bryan Rekar in the Royals' starting rotation. In his first start, he pitched four innings, gave up one run, and earned a nodecision in a 43 loss to the Baltimore Orioles. Affeldt's time as a starter garnered so-so results, as he was 04 with a 5.45 ERA in seven starts. In his last start, on June 8, Affeldt picked up the loss as the Royals fell 113 to the St. Louis Cardinals. After getting pulled in the fourth inning due to an injury, Affeldt {{was placed on the}} disabled list with fingernail and blister problems.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{said that}} the scariest moment of his career was when he {{attempted}} to pitch while sober in a 1973 game. During pre-game warmups, he could not recreate his pitching mechanics. Ellis went to his locker, took some amphetamines with coffee, and returned to pitch. In August 1973, pictures circulated of Ellis wearing hair curlers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> during pre-game warmups. The Pirates {{told him not to}} wear curlers on the field again. Ellis agreed, but charged that the Pirates were displaying racism. Ebony devoted a spread to Ellis about his hairstyles, which was inspired by the hair curlers.|$|E
5|$|Hennessey {{spent the}} entire 2007 season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> for the Giants. At the {{beginning}} of June, he was named the closer by Giants' manager Bruce Bochy after Armando Benítez was traded. From June 30 to August 31, he converted saves in 14 straight save opportunities, the longest streak by a Giant since Robb Nen had a 28-save streak in 2000; overall, Hennessey converted 17 out of 19 saves from May 30 to August 31. Afterwards, he converted only two out of five opportunities before Brian Wilson took over the closer role. In 2007, he went 45 and had a 3.42 ERA and 19 saves (out of 24 opportunities).|$|E
50|$|By 2000, Hawkins was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Twins <b>bullpen,</b> {{appearing}} <b>in</b> 66 games while sporting an ERA of 3.39 {{along with}} 14 saves.|$|R
50|$|Grim got {{the final}} {{out of the}} 1957 All-Star Game, being brought <b>in</b> from <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> with <b>the</b> American League leading 6-5 and getting pinch-hitter Gil Hodges on a game-ending fly out to left field.|$|R
500|$|The dugouts, which measure [...] by , {{are large}} enough to {{accommodate}} each team's staff without the need for relief pitchers to sit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpens.</b> <b>The</b> Sounds' dugout is located on the third-base side; the visiting team's is located on <b>the</b> first-base side. <b>Bullpens</b> are located in foul territory along the left-field and right-field lines near the corner of the outfield wall. The home clubhouse has wooden lockers, two couches, three card tables, and a center table. There is an attached kitchen with two full-size refrigerators and room for hot and cold catering. Other player amenities include large, indoor batting cages, a fully equipped workout room, and a family room for players' partners and children. <b>In</b> 2016, <b>the</b> umpire dressing room was named after former Major League Baseball umpire and Nashville native Chuck Meriwether.|$|R
5|$|In 2010, Affeldt again {{spent the}} entire season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> for the Giants. On March 28, the Giants {{extended}} his contract through the 2011 season with an option for 2012. Affeldt picked up his first save with the Giants in a 6–3 victory over the Atlanta Braves on April 11. He struggled {{for most of the}} season and was placed on the disabled list on July 24 with an oblique strain. After rehabbing in the minors, Affeldt returned to the Giants on August 18. He finished the season with four saves and a 4.14 ERA in fiftythree games.|$|E
5|$|Lieber {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> {{to begin}} the 1996 season. In his first 34 games, he posted a 4.21 ERA. In July, {{he returned to the}} starting rotation following the release of Zane Smith. As a starter, Lieber posted a 72 record with a 3.91 ERA, emerging as the Pirates' ace {{by the end of the}} year. In 51 games (15 starts) in 1996, Lieber posted a 95 record, a 3.99 ERA, 94 strikeouts, 28 walks, and 156 hits allowed in 142 innings pitched.|$|E
5|$|Loup was one {{of eight}} {{pitchers}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> for the Blue Jays' 2014 opening day. On April 20, Loup walked three consecutive batters {{for the first time}} in his career, and took the loss as the Blue Jays fell to the Cleveland Indians 6–4. On May 3, the Blue Jays announced that Loup would replace Sergio Santos as the team's closer until Casey Janssen returned from injury. After walking as many batters in three months as he had the entire last season, Loup regained confidence after pitching the last few innings of a game on June 4 that went from a 3–2 lead to an 8–2 win against the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
50|$|Don Wert's eighth-inning double {{momentarily}} {{gave the}} AL {{a threat to}} tie the game, but Seaver struck out <b>the</b> side. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ninth, with two out, Jerry Koosman was brought <b>in</b> from <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> to face Carl Yastrzemski, whose strikeout ended the game.|$|R
50|$|On June 29, 2010 Jenrry Mejía {{was sent}} back down to Double-A Binghamton and the Mets called up Parnell to take his spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mets <b>bullpen.</b>|$|R
50|$|He was {{promoted}} to the Las Vegas 51s, the Dodgers Triple-A team, during the 2005 season and pitched primarily <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 51s <b>bullpen</b> for <b>the</b> next two seasons.|$|R
5|$|The year 1956 was {{not very}} {{different}} from 1955 for Koufax. Despite the blazing speed of his fastball, Koufax continued to struggle with his control. He saw little work, pitching only 58.7 innings with a 4.91 ERA, 29 walks and 30 strikeouts. When Koufax allowed baserunners, he was rarely permitted to finish the inning. Teammate Joe Pignatano said that, as soon as Koufax threw a couple of balls in a row, Alston would signal for a replacement to start warming up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen.</b> Jackie Robinson, in his final season, clashed with Alston on Koufax's usage. Robinson saw that Koufax was talented and had flashes of brilliance, and objected to Koufax being benched {{for weeks at a}} time.|$|E
5|$|Lieber began 2007 on the DL with a {{strained}} right oblique, {{and when he}} was activated on April 9, he was placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen.</b> After two relief outings, he returned to the rotation on April 20 when Brett Myers was moved to the bullpen. On June 9, he struck out 11 and allowed three hits in a 40 shutout of the Royals. At the time, he was 34 with a 3.72 ERA, but he allowed 14 runs (13 earned) over his next two starts, both losses. On June 23, Lieber was placed on the DL with a ruptured tendon in his right foot, which ended his tenure with the Phillies. In 14 games (12 starts), he had a 36 record, a 4.73 ERA, 54 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 91 hits allowed in 78 innings. The Phillies reached the playoffs, but Lieber was left off their postseason roster because of his injury.|$|E
5|$|Mario Eduardo Lemus Hollands (born August 26, 1988) is an American {{professional}} baseball pitcher {{who is currently}} a free agent. He played college baseball for the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos, where he {{earned a degree in}} sociology. The Phillies drafted him in the 2010 MLB Draft, and after a few seasons in the farm system, they invited him to spring training in 2014. After performing well in those exhibition games, he made the Phillies' 2014 Opening Day roster, and although he walked too many hitters, showed some potential to emerge as a decent relief pitcher. His teammates described him as a good personality to have <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen,</b> and his coaches approved of his development. Meanwhile, he is pursuing another college degree; he is studying merchandise marketing at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising.|$|E
50|$|In 2014, Thornburg began <b>the</b> season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Brewers' <b>bullpen</b> before {{suffering}} a season-ending elbow injury. Thornburg {{spent most of}} <b>the</b> 2015 season <b>in</b> AAA regaining his arm strength.|$|R
5|$|Hoffman, {{whose mother}} was born <b>in</b> England, was <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> coach for <b>the</b> Great Britain team during the {{qualifying}} {{round of the}} 2017 World Baseball Classic.|$|R
50|$|Hale {{spent the}} {{majority}} of <b>the</b> 2014 season <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Braves <b>bullpen</b> after beginning <b>the</b> season as a starter. He started 6 games before shifting to <b>the</b> <b>bullpen,</b> where he ended up appearing in 39 games. Overall, Hale finished the 2014 season with 45 appearances and a 4-5 record with a 3.30 ERA in 87.1 innings.|$|R
5|$|Nathan {{spent all}} of 2003 with the Giants <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> after marrying Lisa Lemoncelli, his girlfriend of five years, in November 2002. This was a {{breakout}} year for Nathan, starting the season with 23 scoreless innings {{en route to a}} 12–4 record in his first full year as a reliever. His 78 appearances put him {{high on the list of}} most-used pitchers for the season as one of the best setup men in the NL, allowing no runs in 15 appearances from July 18 to August 20. His 12 wins in relief led the majors. The Giants won the National League West by 15 games and drew the Florida Marlins, the National League's wild card winner, in the NLDS. Nathan was hit hard in that series, blowing his only save opportunity. His team fared no better, winning Game 1 behind Jason Schmidt's complete game shutout before dropping the next three.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez pitched for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre for the {{remainder}} of the International League season, finishing with a Class AAA record of 1–5 with a 3.19 ERA in 29 games. Ramírez was promoted to the Yankees when MLB rosters expanded on September 1. He remained with the Yankees for September; along with fellow call-ups Jonathan Albaladejo, David Robertson, Mike Dunn and Mark Melancon, Ramírez was expected to absorb some of the workload <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen,</b> helping to spare the overworked Alfredo Aceves, Phil Hughes, Phil Coke, and Dámaso Marte. Towards the end of the season, he was only used on blowout games as a result of his ineffectiveness. Ramírez finished the season with a 5.73 ERA, allowing fourteen earned runs in 22 innings; though he did strike out exactly one batter per inning, he also issued too many walks as he struggled with consistency. Though Ramírez did not appear in the 2009 postseason with the Yankees, the organization did present him with a 2009 World Series ring.|$|E
5|$|Sánchez did {{not stay}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpen</b> very long though. After Randy Johnson {{strained}} his shoulder, Sánchez {{was chosen to}} start against the San Diego Padres on July 10. In that game, Sánchez not only threw the first complete game and the first shutout of his career; he threw a no-hitter, becoming the first Giants' pitcher to do so since John Montefusco no-hit the Atlanta Braves in 1976. In the process, Sánchez struck out a new career high of eleven batters. Sánchez had a perfect game going into the eighth inning, but an error by Juan Uribe allowed the only baserunner of the night. Sánchez almost lost the no-hitter during the ninth inning when Edgar Gonzalez hit a ball deep to centerfield. However, Aaron Rowand made a spectacular catch, and Sánchez got his no-hitter. Sánchez's no-hitter was also special because his father Sigfredo, who had never seen his son start a major league game, was in attendance.|$|E
50|$|He {{earned a}} spot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cardinals' <b>bullpen</b> <b>in</b> Spring , but {{got off to}} a horrible start to the regular season (11.57 ERA & 1 blown save in April). He then entered the {{starting}} rotation, and made the finest start of his major league career on May 14 against <b>the</b> Padres. <b>In</b> seven innings, he surrendered five hits and one earned run to earn the win. On May 30, after returning to <b>the</b> <b>bullpen,</b> he struck Montreal Expos outfielder Ellis Valentine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face with a pitch, shattering his cheekbone. He remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Cards' <b>bullpen</b> another month until he was optioned down to Springfield to make room for Silvio Martinez's return from the disabled list. After the season, he was drafted by <b>the</b> Oakland Athletics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980 rule 5 draft.|$|R
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> eighth <b>inning,</b> <b>the</b> <b>bullpens</b> took over. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{top of the}} eighth. Nationals {{reliever}} Ryan Madson gave up doubles to pinch-hitter Jon Jay and Anthony Rizzo, {{allowing the}} Cubs to push their lead to 3-0. No one else reached base for either team, Carl Edwards Jr. pitching a perfect eighth for the Cubs, Brandon Kintzler a perfect ninth for the Nationals, and Wade Davis closing with a perfect ninth for the Cubs. With Washington managing only two hits – and none after <b>the</b> second <b>inning</b> – Chicago took a 1-0 lead <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1997, <b>the</b> <b>bullpens</b> {{moved from}} along the foul {{lines to the}} outfield. The visitor and home bullpens create {{artificial}} home run porches in left and right field respectively. <b>In</b> 2007, <b>the</b> outfield fence was replaced and moved in 10-20 feet in some areas and bullpens moved once again.|$|R
