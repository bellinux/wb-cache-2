Programs that accredit engineers need to provide course assessment and learning activities that develop these essential skills. One tool that {{has been identified as}} important for supporting development of self-assessment is the ePortfolio. A three year longitudinal study of first-year engineering student engagement with and success in self-assessment using ePortfolios has been conducted. The self-assessment task was embedded within students’ ePortfolios that they compiled to display and reflect upon their CAD modelling and engineering drawings. In each of the three years, students were introduced and supported in self-assessment through ePortfolios with similar orientation experiences, focused computer practical sessions, mentor support and developmental feedback from teaching staff and <b>helpdesks.</b> The proportion of students that participated in the self-assessment activity, the depth of their reflection and their ability to predict their final grade compared to the actual grade, were used to evaluate student’s self-assessment skill development.

The personnel of such service points need a system that support their work efficiently and in a usable way. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the relationship between the usability of the counter system and the overall customer satisfaction. In order to record required data, an adapted usability questionnaire and a customer interview was used as well as observations of performance values. Statistical analysis reveiled two significant interactions. The first relationship exists between the expertise of the counter personnel and the duration of an interaction. The second finding was a negative association between the usability values and the customer satisfaction. These results indicate the personnel not only being a transmitter of information, but rather a powerful filter and translator of inputs and outputs on his system. The practical implication of these findings is to improve the counter system usability in order to effectively facilitate customer service and, therefore, overall customer satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract E-learning {{has emerged}} as a new {{paradigm}} in today’s education. Many e-learning applications have been developed to meet the increasing demand by education institutions. Previous research mainly focused on a variety of factors that influence the uptake of e-learning. However, very {{little is known about the}} quality and the extent of usage of these applications among end users. This study presents results that contain information on the uptake and use of e-learning. The uptake of e-learning is measured by the extent to which different technologies were used by students. A mail survey was conducted to examine the uptake of e-learning among undergraduates. The respondents for this study comprised of 419 respondents representing 16. 8 % from a random sample size of 2500 students. Thirty four applications available from Universiti Utara Malaysia Learning information system (Learningzone) were grouped into six categories that served as e-learning benchmarks to assess the uptake of e-learning among undergraduates. The results show that accessing for course materials, communications, viewing information are the commonly used applications while <b>helpdesks</b> and support, and link to other centres are least popular among undergraduates...|$|R
40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{products}} - particularly highly innovative and intelligent products - are being returned by customers, while analysis shows {{that many of these}} products are in fact functioning according to their technical specifications. Product developers are recognizing the need for information that gives more detail about the reason for these product returns, in order to find the root cause of the problems. Traditionally a lot of information from the field is stored in departments like sales and service (<b>helpdesks</b> and repair centers). Combining these data sources with new field feedback data sources, like customer experiences on the internet and product log files, could provide product developers with more in-depth and accurate information about the actual product performance and the context of use. Case studies were done at two different industries: a company from consumer electronic industry and a company from professional medical system industry. The Maturity Index on Reliability (MIR) method, a method to assess capability for businesses to respond to product reliability related issues, was combined with Contextual Design, a method for user context mapping and requirement definition, and explored as a means to analyze the structure and capability of the current field feedback process in supporting the development of complex and innovative products...|$|R

40|$|Interactive {{online help}} systems are {{considered}} to be a fruitful supplement to traditional IT <b>helpdesks,</b> which are often overloaded. They often comprise user-generated FAQ collections playing the role of technology-based conceptual artifacts. Two main questions arise: how the conceptual artifacts should be used, and which factors influence their acceptance in a community of practice (CoP). Firstly, this paper offers a theoretical frame and a usage scenario for technology-based conceptual artifacts against the theoretical background of the academic help-seeking and CoP approach. Each of the two approaches is extensively covered by psychological and educational research literature, however their combination is not yet sufficiently investigated. Secondly, the paper proposes a research model explaining the acceptance of conceptual artifacts. The model includes users 2 ̆ 7 expectations toward the artifact, perceived social influence and users 2 ̆ 7 roles in the CoP as predictors of artifact use intention and actual usage. A correlational study conducted in an academic software users 2 ̆ 7 CoP and involving structural equations modeling validates the model, suggesting thus a research line that is worth further pursuing. For educational practice, the study suggests three ways of supporting knowledge sharing in CoPs, i. e. use of technology-based conceptual artifacts, roles and division of labor, and purposeful communication in CoPs...|$|R
40|$|This article {{highlights}} some of {{the opportunities}} and challenges that collaboration between higher education institutions (HEIs) can bring {{to the development of}} sustainable community-university partnerships. In particular, it explores the potential for universities to collaborate on building effective engagement mechanisms (such as <b>helpdesks,</b> ‘hub and spoke’ contact models, and research groups to review ideas for activities) that will support an ongoing flow of new projects and partnerships over time. It draws on evidence gathered from the evaluation and coordination of the South East Coastal Communities (SECC) program, an almost unique experiment in collaboration between English universities. &# 13; &# 13; In an ‘age of austerity’, opportunities to reduce costs without damaging core services are of particular interest to public funding bodies. The article suggests that collaboration between universities may be an efficient and effective way of engaging with local communities, but that it is not cost-free, and high-level strategic buy-in within HEIs is required if community-university partnerships are to thrive in the current higher education funding environment. &# 13; &# 13; The article also suggests {{that there may be a}} geographic dimension to effective collaboration between universities in both community-university partnership work and the mechanisms that support community engagement. Inter-university collaboration across the whole region covered by the SECC program has been much weaker than collaboration at a subregional level and within ‘city-regions’ in particular. This raises a key question: does the natural geography for effective collaboration between universities need to reflect, at least in part, the geographies of communities themselves, in terms of lived experiences and/or community representation? Such a debate has interesting and timely parallels in the United Kingdom, where the new coalition government is bringing about a fundamental shift in the geography of public administration, with the aim of both increasing democratic accountability and improving the spatial fit between policy interventions and economic and social ‘reality’. &# 13; &# 13; Keywords&# 13; Community-university partnership, collaboration between universities, engagement mechanisms, sustainability, geographic communitie...|$|R
40|$|Sensemaking {{tasks are}} {{challenging}} and typically involve collecting, organizing and understanding information. Sensemaking often involves a handoff where a subsequent recipient picks up {{work done by}} a provider. Sensemaking handoffs are very challenging because handoffs introduce discontinuity in sensemaking. This dissertation attempts to explore various factors involved in sensemaking handoffs. This work drew on existing literature on sensemaking to propose five sensemaking task attributes: representation novelty required, encoding difficulty, broader applicability, representation search space and subtask interdependence. These attributes capture what makes sensemaking difficult and also help in choosing tasks to study sensemaking as well as modifying laboratory tasks so that they involve more sensemaking. Synthesizing existing literature on collaboration, the dissertation identified important elements in a sensemaking handoff: intent to collaborate, common ground, shared space, awareness, additional communication and handoff artifacts. These make up an ecology that helps deal with challenges of sensemaking expressed by the attributes of sensemaking tasks. A study of sensemaking handoffs in computer-support <b>helpdesks</b> found that sensemaking handoffs could be successful, especially when various collaboration elements complement handoff materials. The study also {{raised questions about the}} quality and utility of handoff material from incomplete sensemaking, and about the timing of handoffs. Three lab-studies conducted in the dissertation provided insights regarding the role of artifacts in sensemaking handoffs. The first study confirmed that handoff can be as effective as simultaneous collaboration. The second lab-study suggests that the quality of the handed-off material was important. Poor quality material seemed to be used at different times and in different ways from good quality material. The third lab-study found that available structure in the form of websites as well as handoff artifacts can have an effect on sensemaking. When external structure was available people adapted and used it early on. People appropriated structure sooner from the handoff artifacts when structure was not easily available externally, as compared to when structure was easily available externally. Artifact maturity was also found to have an effect; artifacts from late stages that were placeholders for structures in a task were used more often and were rated higher by the recipients...|$|R
