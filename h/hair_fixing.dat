40|$|A {{simple and}} direct method based on hollow fibresupported liquid {{membrane}} (HFSLM) extraction and liquid chromatography {{equipped with a}} UV detector was developed for analysis and quantification of parabens in cosmetic products. The parabens analysed included methyl, ethyl, propyl, isobutyl and butyl paraben. The HFSLM extraction {{was carried out by}} employing di-n-hexyl ether as organic liquid that was immobilized in the hollow fibre membrane. The HFSLM extraction is simple, cheap, minimizes the use of solvents and uses disposable material. In an investigation of 11 paraben- containing cosmetic products, the levels of parabens (sum of all parabens in a product) ranged from 0. 43 % to 0. 79 % (w/w) for skin care products, 0. 07 – 0. 44 % for <b>hair</b> <b>fixing</b> gels and 0. 30 – 0. 52 % for soap solutions. The levels of individual parabens in individual cosmetic products ranged between 0. 03 % and 0. 42 % w/w for skin care products, 0. 07 % and 0. 26 % w/w for <b>hair</b> <b>fixing</b> gels and between 0. 11 % and 0. 34 % w/w for soap solutions. Parabens were found in the highest concentrations in skin care products followed by soap solutions and the least amounts were found in <b>hair</b> <b>fixing</b> gels. Of the paraben-containing products tested, all of them contained methyl paraben and about 90 % contained propyl paraben in addition to methyl paraben. One product contained all the parabens analysed...|$|E

40|$|Laser axotomy {{followed}} by time-lapse microscopy is a sensitive assay for axon regeneration phenotypes in C. elegans 1. The main difficulty of this assay is the perceived cost ($ 25 - 100 K) and technical expertise required for implementing a laser ablation system 2, 3. However, solid-state pulse lasers of modest costs (<$ 10 K) can provide robust performance for laser ablation in transparent preparations where target axons are "close " to the tissue surface. Construction and alignment {{of a system}} can be accomplished in a day. The optical path provided by light from the focused condenser to the ablation laser provides a convenient alignment guide. An intermediate module with all optics removed can be dedicated to the ablation laser and assures that no optical elements need be moved during a laser ablation session. A dichroic in the intermediate module allows simultaneous imaging and laser ablation. Centering the laser beam to the outgoing beam from the focused microscope condenser lens guides the initial alignment of the system. A variety of lenses are used to condition and expand the laser beam to fill the back aperture of the chosen objective lens. Final alignment and testing is performed with a front surface mirrored glass slide target. Laser power is adjusted to give a minimum size ablation spot (< 1 um).

Reading aloud was not an accomplishment of his, but in their courting days she had expressed herself pleased at his attempts, and of this he took care, in his turn, to remind her. It was his idea that if the game were played at all, she should take a hand also. If he was to blither, it was only fair that she should bleat back. As he explained, for the future they would both be lovers all their life long; and no logical argument in reply could she think of. If she tried to write a letter, he would snatch away the paper her dear hands were pressing and fall to kissing it--and, of course, smearing it.

40|$|Olfactory {{transduction}} {{is thought}} {{to occur in the}} outer dendritic membrane of insect olfactory receptor neurons. Electrophysiological studies have indicated that the outer dendritic membrane has non-specific cation channels and inositol-triphosphate-dependent Ca 2 + channels. The presence of such channels is further supported by the observation that pheromone-stimulated dendrites take up cobalt. However, to date, there is no structural evidence for these channels. Therefore, in order to search for putative ion channels, we have imaged the membrane of the olfactory dendrites in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the atomic-force microscope (AFM), after extruding the dendrites out of the olfactory <b>hairs</b> and <b>fixing</b> them on plastic coverslips. With the aid of the SEM, we could see the beaded structure of the dendrite but no fine structural details, as the membrane was sputtered with gold. With the use of the contact mode of the AFM, we could see ''pores'' that were deeper than 3 nm and with a diameter of about 15 nm. The density of the ''pores'' was approximately 20 /mu m(2) or 10000 pores per thick dendrite. We believe these to be putative ion channels based on indirect evidence. [References: 35...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from African Bird Club. The White-tailed Swallow Hirundo megaensis is a threatened and poorly known bird endemic to southern Ethiopia, where it is restricted to a small area of Acacia savanna. Despite the paucity of previous nest records, we found 67 nests in the years 2010 – 14, commonly in village huts lived in by people, and report the first confirmation of nesting (two certain records) in termite mounds. Its nests are small mud cups lined with grass and animal <b>hair,</b> <b>fixed</b> to roof joists and {{similar to those of}} its sister species, the Pearl-breasted Swallow H. dimidiata of southern Africa, although it appears to lay larger clutches (3 – 4 pure white eggs) and breed less frequently, producing one brood in each of its two rain-driven breeding seasons (April–June and October–November). The same nests are reportedly used in these two seasons, presumably by the same pairs. Incubation lasts 16 – 17 days, with some broods showing clearly smaller chicks and hence presumably asynchronous hatching. Study of nestlings in the hand and museum skins confirmed that juveniles can be determined by their shorter tails, browner heads and frequently also wings, and reduced white in the tail. Although birds are typically seen singly or in pairs, flocks of up to 50, sometimes mixed with other hirundines, can occur. The breeding range appears to be almost identical to that of the Ethiopian Bush-crow Zavattariornis stresemanni but regular sightings of White-tailed Swallows since 2005 at the Liben Plain, 120 km to the east of the core area, suggest that the birds are frequent visitors there. We are grateful to the numerous funding bodies which have supported this research over several years: NERC, RSPB, British Birdfair, African Bird Club, British Ornithologists’ Union, Gesellschaft für Tropenornithologie, Tim Whitmore Zoology Fund, Magdalene College (Cambridge), Cambridge Philosophical Society, and BirdLife Preventing Extinctions Programme; and especially to Julian Francis.

40|$|Cadherin 23 and protocadherin 15 are {{components}} of tip links, fine filaments that interlink the stereocilia of hair cells and {{are believed to}} gate the hair cell's mechanotransducer channels. Tip links are aligned along the hair bundle's axis of mechanosensitivity, stretching obliquely {{from the top of}} one stereocilium to the side of an adjacent, taller stereocilium. In guinea pig auditory hair cells, tip links are polarized with cadherin 23 at the upper end and protocadherin 15 at the lower end, where the transducer channel is located. Double immunogold labeling of avian hair cells was used to study the distribution of these two proteins in kinocilial links, a link type that attaches the tallest stereocilia of the hair bundle to the kinocilium. In the kinocilial links of vestibular hair bundles, cadherin 23 localizes to the stereocilium and protocadherin 15 to the kinocilium. The two cadherins are therefore asymmetrically distributed within the kinocilial links but of a polarity that is, within those links that are aligned along the hair bundle's axis of sensitivity, reversed relative to that of tip links. Conventional transmission electron microscopy of <b>hair</b> bundles <b>fixed</b> in the presence of tannic acid reveals a distinct density in the 120 - 130 nm long kinocilial links that is located 35 - 40 nm from the kinociliary membrane.

40|$|Background and Objectives : All {{elements}} {{existing in}} orthodontic alloys can {{be released to}} the oral cavity as corrosion products; therefore, they can accumulate in body tissues after systemic absorption. Among body tissues that can be evaluated for systemic absorption of nickel, {{in this study we}} used hair strands, because if nickel is absorbed systematically, it would accumulate in these strands over time. Furthermore, hair sampling is a non-invasive method, so the main aim of this study was the evaluation of nickel ions release into the <b>hair</b> strands of <b>fixed</b> orthodontic patients compared with the control group in a 4 -month duration. Materials and Methods: In this clinical trial, the test group included 24 female patients between 12 - 20 years of age that were going to begin fixed orthodontic treatment. The control group consisted of their sisters in the same age range, who volunteered to participate in this study. Initial hair samples were taken from both groups at the beginning the study and immediately before setting up the fixed appliances in test group. The samples were taken from three different scalp sites including; frontal, vertex, and occipital areas. After 16 weeks, hair samples were taken from approximately the same scalp areas in both the groups. The samples were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometer and data analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. Results: This study showed that there were significant differences in nickel levels before and after study for case (P = 0. 004) and control groups (P = 0. 012). The mean nickel concentration after four months was 0. 382 ± 0. 36 μg/g for controls and 0. 673 ± 0. 38 μg/g for the case group, which was significantly different (P = 0. 002).

40|$|Sound {{wildlife}} conservation decisions require sound information, and scientists increasingly rely on remotely collected data over large spatial scales, such as noninvasive genetic tagging (NGT). Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), for example, {{are difficult to}} study at population scales except with noninvasive data, and NGT via hair trapping informs management over much of grizzly bears' range. Considerable statistical effort has gone into estimating sources of heterogeneity, but detection error-arising when a visiting bear fails to leave a hair sample-has not been independently estimated. We used camera traps to survey grizzly bear occurrence at <b>fixed</b> <b>hair</b> traps and multi-method hierarchical occupancy models to estimate {{the probability that a}} visiting bear actually leaves a hair sample with viable DNA. We surveyed grizzly bears via hair trapping and camera trapping for 8 monthly surveys at 50 (2012) and 76 (2013) sites in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. We used multi-method occupancy models to estimate site occupancy, probability of detection, and conditional occupancy at a hair trap. We tested the prediction that detection error in NGT studies could be induced by temporal variability within season, leading to underestimation of occupancy. NGT via hair trapping consistently underestimated grizzly bear occupancy at a site when compared to camera trapping. At best occupancy was underestimated by 50 %; at worst, by 95 %. Probability of false absence was reduced through successive surveys, but this mainly accounts for error imparted by movement among repeated surveys, not necessarily missed detections by extant bears. The implications of missed detections and biased occupancy estimates for density estimation-which form the crux of management plans-require consideration. We suggest hair-trap NGT studies should estimate and correct detection error using independent survey methods such as cameras, to ensure the reliability of the data upon which species management and conservation actions are based...|$|R
5000|$|Each cell {{has four}} flagella of equal length, {{in which the}} flagella are shorter than {{the length of the}} cell. [...] The flagella emerge from the apical {{depression}} in pairs and point in opposite directions, running parallel to the long side of the cell. [...] Due to their emergence from a deep depression, the mechanical force the flagella can produce is restricted. [...] Other lineages with non-depressed flagellar insertions can produce higher amounts of flagellar force, because the flagellar base is not geometrically limited. [...] The flagella of Tetraselmis species are thick, covered in mucilaginous material, and have a blunt end. [...] They are also covered in flagellar hairs which are loosely attached to the cell exterior; they are cross-striated with two scale layers on flagella. [...] See figure 3 for a detailed picture of flagella including their scales and hair. The inner layer is compact and densely covers the flagella, and hair cells are attached to the cell membrane through small sections of membrane that are not covered due to patterning. [...] The outer scale layer is made of small-round scales which are mainly used to overlap bare membrane not covered by the inner scales. [...] The inner scales are larger than the outer scales, and usually resemble a pentagon or square in shape. [...] See figure 1 for a generalized drawing of flagellar scales. The flagellar hairs have a distinct sequence of structural components, the proximal filament connects the flagellum and cell surface, this is followed by the tubular shaft, then the transition zone in which the shaft is modified, followed by a stretch of linear globular subunits, and the hair ends with a distal filament. [...] The distal filament and transition zone are the only components that are not produced by certain species. [...] Flagellar <b>hairs</b> have a <b>fixed</b> number of distal subunit repeats, which varies between 2-44 subunits depending on the species. [...] Thus, flagellar hairs are a good morphological tool for species comparison and classification. [...] Figure 1 includes these hairs on the flagella drawing. Species use their flagella to travel in straight lines while rotating along their axis, in which they travel in one direction for long distances and then abruptly change directions instantaneously without stopping.

40|$|I. Histologica! {{studies of}} calf skin In {{the case of}} tanning of leather and manufaeturing of gelatin, the skin always must be soaked in lime solution. Then the tissues and organs in the skin will {{make a lot of}} morphologically {{remarkable}} changes. Accordingly, in th first place the writer has observed minutely the tissues and organs of the backskin of the Holstein calf. The principal results obtained are as follows : 1. There was no great difference between the skin of the Holstein species and that of others. The former was composed of epidermis, corium and subcutaneous tissue that existed in animals skin in general. 2. The lucidum layer on that epidermis of the back skin, the appearance of which had not been reported, was discovered in this reserch. 3. The papillate layer of calf skin, occupying 45 ^ of all skin thickness, was comparatively thicker than that of the matured cattle skin, -while the reticular layer of calf skin was relatively thin. It was recognized distinctly that the sweat gland and the hair of calf skin were inferior in development to those of the matured cattle skin. 4. There was a little difference between the type of. collagen fibre in the papillate layer ani that in the reticular layer. The rcil form of the so-called grain layer was morphologically not yet clearly recognized. In the; collagen fibre, the kittsubstance was recognized. 5. In the case of the elastic fibre, it was picked up ani left alone for a long time, special striped figures similar to micula emerged {{in the center of the}} elastic fibre. From a distributing point of view, it was considered that there were twojtypes in the elastic fibre. II. On the change of the calf skin during the process of liming It was researched how the tissue of t'le skin suffered changes when it was soaked in the lime solution. The results are as follows : 1. When the raw skin was soaked in the saturate! solution of lime, every cellular element of skin took various forms to be dissolved, and most of them vanished within 72 hours. The cells of sweat glands and arectorpili muscles were the earliest, and every call in epidermis the next and the cell, in the hair follicle the last to be solved. 2. The keratin substance which composed the epidermis was dissolved in the lime solution. But layers in the epidermis separated not individually from one another, but together from the part of the corium. In this case the internal part of the epidermis melted and became one membrane-like plate. 3. The kittsubstance amon 3 the tissues Wire dissolved early, and tissues came to be in isolated states. When this state was over the remaining tissues (collagen fibres) swelled and occupied the space which was produced by the separation. 4. The collagen fibres began to swvell immediately after soaking, an 1 increased the degree of expansion as time passed, but began to separate from one another after about 72 hours owing to the dissolution of kittsubstanca. At the same time the fine fibres also begin to swell ani continued to separate from one another for about 7 days. Afterwards the spaces were not recognized because of the swelling. ^The collagen fibres in papillate layers was earlier in separation and expansion than those in reticular layers. 5. The elastic fibres swelled little by little, and the changes in the form were not recognized so clearly. 6. Some of the cells of the sebaceous gland made little change by lime soaking, except the nuclear change by lims soaking, but the nucleus in those cells made a change of form or was dissolved. It was not possible for the cytoplasma of the cells in raw skin to be stained by acid fuchsin, but they -were stained when soaked in lime solution. 7. The medulla of hairs did not make so much of a chage as others did, but the cells surrounding to support the hairs ･were dissolved, and so the hairs were isolated from one another into a floating condition. Moreover, this floating condition was thought to be enlarged by the spaces of sweat glands. Nevertheless, the <b>hair</b> became <b>fixed</b> by the pressure of the swelled collagen fibre because of the long soaking in the lime solution. 8. According to the facts mentioned above, it was thought best to unhair, after the skin were soaked for 5 or 8 days in lime solution at 18 °C. In comparison with various former theories of unhairing, it was proved that the chief cause of unhairing was the change in the form, produced by collapse of the tissue. III, On the change of fixed calf skin during the process of liming 1. Every tissue and organ in the skin, when it was fixed with formalin, stood against the lime action, and the resistance made a great difference in degree according to the variety of the tissue. 2. It took a long time for the cellular substance of skin to make changes, and it took about 30 days from the day on which it began to show the beginning of change to the dissolution, and each of the processes of change was not equal to each other. It became hard from staining on the fifteenth day or so after being soaked in lime solution. 3. The state of separation of the collagen fibre, from between the epidermis and the corium and from the corium was unsettled and indefinite. Especially the collagen fibres in the reticular layer was indefinite in separation. 4. The kittsubstance in every tissue and organ of the fixed skin grew strong against the lime solution. The floating condition of the collagen fibre and the hair was extremely rarely seen. The suitable time for unhairing cannot be determined, and the complete dehairing does not take place. IV. On the change of skin digested by trypsin 1. Being digested with trypsin, the skin lost the elastic fibres chiefly. That is to say, the fine elastic fibre which was complicated around every tissue and organ in the papillate layer began to vanish at first, and then gradually the large bundles of the elastic fibre in the reticular layer and the telasubcutanea were broken. All the elastic fibres disappeared within 20 hours. * 2. Being digested with the trypsin for. 20 hours, the collagen fibre swelled a little, but remarkable changes were not seen in from. The tissue, composed of keratin, seemed to be denaturated, but no great change was recognized in form. V. Histochemical studies on the reaction in the skin treated by lime solution 1. The collagen fibre degenerated and presented reaction of acidity or neutrality by soaking the raw skin in lime solution. In the case of treating the collagen fibre with silver nitrate, there appeared little dots in stripes. 2. The elastic fibre presented the basic character. That is the elastic fibre combined with lime, formed the protein base, and therefore presented remarkable reactions to the special pigments and was stained better than in the case of raw skin. Silver grains were not recognized in the place Where the elastic fibre existed. 3. The epidermistic tissue (including epidermis) also presented basic character by liming. 4 - The contents of the sebum cutaneum in the sebaceous gland are very complicated, and the reaction by lime solution is not always equal. It was considered that the sebum cutaneum seldom saponifies. The effect of taking fat away by liming was considered to be chiefly in breaking the supporting tissue...|$|R
