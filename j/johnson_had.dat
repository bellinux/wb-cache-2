5|$|In September, a poll {{conducted}} by the Goldwater campaign revealed that <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> a comfortable lead over him. Indeed, Goldwater's campaign was an uphill battle against an incumbent administration during a prosperous economy. In {{the wake of the}} death of John Kennedy, who had been leading in polls for reelection in 1964, there lingered the possibility that <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> the sympathy of the media and voters.|$|E

However, he was not {{prominent}} in the Tests, taking seven wickets at a bowling average of 61.00. Among the frontline bowlers who played in four or more Tests, <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> the worst average by a factor of almost two and took the least number of wickets. <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at a batting average of 10.20, but took five catches in the slips.|$|E

5|$|As {{the only}} member from a seceded state {{to remain in the}} Senate and the most {{prominent}} Southern Unionist, <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> Lincoln's ear in the early months of the war.

5|$|In 2011, <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> {{his second}} best {{statistical}} season of his NFL career, reaching a career-high 1,681 receiving yards and 16touchdowns. In Week 4 against the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson helped rally the Lions from a 24-point deficit to a 3430 victory by catching two touchdown {{passes in the}} fourth quarter, including a famous catch in which Johnson beat the Cowboys' triple coverage in the end zone. This performance gave Johnson eighttouchdown receptions through the first four {{games of the season}} and tied Cris Carter for most consecutive games with multiple touchdown receptions with four.

5|$|In {{the season}} opener against the Chicago Bears, Johnson caught a pass with 31seconds left in {{regulation}} {{in the end zone}} for what looked like a game-winning touchdown.

The Lions lost the game by a score of 1914.|$|E
5|$|<b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> several health problems, {{including}} childhood tuberculous scrofula {{resulting in}} deep facial scarring, deafness {{in one ear}} and blindness in one eye, gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{probably}} began {{fighting in}} June 1783, {{at the age}} of thirty-three, although Brailsford suggests it was 1781 or slightly earlier. <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> unintentionally slighted a carman (horse-drawn wagon driver) and fighter called Jack Jarvis, who then called for Johnson to fight him as a matter of honour. Johnson comprehensively battered the experienced Jarvis at Lock's Fields, and his name {{came to the attention of}} professional fighters. At that time <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> no intention of earning a living from the sport, but he became so goaded by a professional known as The Croydon Drover that a fight was arranged for March 1784, at Kennington Common. Johnson beat the Drover to a pulp in 27minutes and decided to become a professional.|$|E

During the trial, the court heard that Johnson often visited his former residence while drunk, but later expressed his intention not to drink again.|$|E
5|$|The Celtics {{franchise}} has retired Johnson's #3 jersey, which {{hangs from}} the rafters of the TD Garden, the home arena of the team.

5|$|The MCC {{match was}} {{followed}} by Australia's first non-victory of the tour, which against Lancashire. <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> little {{to do in the}} match.

5|$|Throughout October, {{the media}} {{emphasized}} the lead <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> over Goldwater, stating that Goldwater had {{little chance of}} winning the election. This negative coverage of the campaign caused many independent voters, who were not strong supporters of either candidate, not to vote, for they believed {{the result of the}} election had been already determined.|$|E
5|$|After Olander, Williams, and <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> recovered, the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, {{to the point that they}} occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>Johnson</b> <b>had</b> {{focused the}} {{majority}} of his campaign activities on the New Hampshire primary, he announced on November 29, 2011 that he would no longer campaign there due to his inability to gain traction with less than a month until the primary. There was speculation in the media that he might run as a Libertarian Party candidate instead. Johnson acknowledged that he was considering such a move. In December, Politico reported that Johnson would quit the Republican primaries and announce his intention to seek the Libertarian Party nomination at a December 28 press conference. He also encouraged his supporters to vote for Ron Paul in 2012 Republican presidential primaries.|$|E
