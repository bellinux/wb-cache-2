For launch vehicles an advantage of VTHL over HTHL is that the wing can be smaller, since it only has to carry the landing weight of the vehicle, rather than the takeoff weight.|$|R
50|$|Pioneer Rocketplane was an {{aerospace}} {{design and}} development company intent on developing affordable manned space flight.

50|$|Science Realms {{predecessor}} Science Dawn was {{a classified}} program {{to build a}} rocket-launched supersonic horizontal-take off horizontal-landing (HOTOL) SSTO spaceplane. However, {{it became clear that}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>takeoff</b> requirement was an inappropriate application of rocket thrust-to-weight ratio; the angle and relative size of rocket and earth meant the path of least effort was almost completely vertical (completely against gravitation). Consequently, SCIENCE DAWN ended, and the focus transferred to SCIENCE REALM.|$|E
50|$|HTVL or <b>horizontal</b> <b>takeoff</b> and {{vertical}} landing is the spaceflight equivalent of aviation HTOVL (and its subtypes CTOVL, STOVL, CATOVL). This {{mode of operation}} has not been used, but has been proposed for some systems that use a two-stage to orbit launch system with a plane based first stage, and a capsule return vehicle.

40|$|VSTOL attack {{aircraft}} {{to be developed}} in the mid- or late- 1990 's and research programs dealing with possible characteristics are discussed. Design studies of <b>horizontal</b> attitude <b>takeoff</b> and landing (HATOL) and vertical attitude takeoff and landing (VATOL) type aircraft were executed and wind tunnel models were built and tested. The configurations tested were a wing-canard HATOL concept with jet-diffuser ejectors as a vertical lift system {{and a variety of}} the same with nacelles which are closer together. Other proposals were a HATOL concept with wing-canard design and two vertical tails on twin afterbodies, and a VATOL concept which is tailless with an extended leading-edge wing to increase lift. Aerodynamic uncertainties were defined and wind tunnel tests were made. Special research concerning top-mounted air induction systems is also covered...|$|R
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in the Ames 9 by 7 ft supersonic wind tunnel to measure the aerodynamic characteristics of two <b>horizontal</b> attitude <b>takeoff</b> and landing V/STOL fighter/attack aircraft concepts. One concept featured a jet diffuser ejector for its vertical lift system and the other employed a remote augmentation lift system (RALS). Test results for Mach numbers from 1. 6 to 2. 0 are reported. Effects of varying the angle of attack (- 4 deg to + 17 deg), angle of sideslip (- 4 deg to + 8 deg) Mach number, and configuration building were investigated.

Detailed effects of varying the angle of attack (up to 27 deg), angle of sideslip (- 4 deg to + 8 deg), Mach number, Reynolds number, and configuration buildup were investigated.

50|$|In 1986 United States {{president}} Ronald Reagan {{announced the}} National Aerospace Plane (NASP) program, intended to develop two X-30 aircraft capable of single stage to orbit (SSTO), {{as well as}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>takeoff</b> and landing from conventional runways. The aircraft {{was to be a}} hydrogen fuelled air-breathing space plane, with a low speed accelerator system to bring the aircraft up to Mach 3, where the main dual-mode scramjet engines (ramjet/scramjet) would take over. At the edge of the atmosphere, a rocket was to take over and provide the final energy for orbital insertion. It was based on a classified DARPA research program called Copper Canyon. This research program suggested that Mach 25 might be possible. As the program proceeded it became clear that Mach 17 was probably the limit, whilst the weight penalty and complexity of the skin heat exchanger and other propulsion systems was going to be substantial. The program was established by the secretary of defence in 1985, and was funded to the end of FY1994, when the decision was made that the 15 billion dollars required to build the two X-30 test craft were excessive.|$|E

The convergence of several critical systems/technologies across the vehicle matrix is indicated.

5000|$|The X-13 was {{designed}} to investigate vertical <b>takeoff,</b> <b>horizontal</b> flight transition, and return to vertical flight for landing. The first prototype of the X-13 was equipped with temporary tricycle landing gear. The X-13 was flown conventionally on December 10, 1955 to test its aerodynamic characteristics. The Vertijet was then fitted with a temporary [...] "tail sitting" [...] rig. On May 28, 1956, it was flown from {{the ground in a}} vertical position to test its hovering qualities. The X-13 VertiJet completed its first full-cycle flight at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on April 11, 1957, when it took off vertically from its mobile trailer, angled over into a horizontal attitude, and flew for several minutes. The X-13 then transitioned to vertical flight and slowly descended back onto its trailer and landed.|$|R
40|$|Guidance {{schemes for}} near-optimum {{performance}} in wind shear are examined. The {{presence of a}} downdraft is assumed {{in addition to the}} <b>horizontal</b> shear. The <b>takeoff</b> problem is considered with reference to flight in a vertical plane. Trajectories for optimum performance in a wind shear are determined for different wind shear models and intensities. Methods of optimal control theory are used together with the dual sequential gradient-restoration algorithm for optimal control problems. Guidance schemes for near-optimum performance in a wind shear are developed, starting from optimal trajectories. These are gamma guidance, based on either the absolute of the relative path inclination, and theta guidance, based on the pitch attitude angle. These schemes are evaluated through numerical experiments in order to determine whether the resulting trajectories are sufficiently close to optimum and to compare these trajectories with those arising from alternative guidance schemes...|$|R
50|$|The Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company, {{established}} by Harold Frederick Pitcairn, designed the PCA-2 {{based on the}} autogiros of Juan de la Cierva. The resulting design had a standard aircraft fuselage and powerplant, with a standard tail. However, it sported short, stubby wings, angled up at the wingtips. Above the cockpit was the rotor, consisting of three blades. The engine usually drove a standard propellor, on a vertical plane, {{in front of the}} aircraft. However, the engine could be geared to the <b>horizontal</b> rotor during <b>takeoff</b> or landing. The horizontal rotor, while in flight, did not draw energy from the engine but rather generated lift from airspeed. A minimum speed of 30 mph was needed to keep the aircraft in flight. Thus, in moderate winds, the aircraft could behave like a helicopter, except that it could not hover.|$|R
