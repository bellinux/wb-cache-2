The access network can be both wired and wireless. Testing and assuring security in access networks is time-consuming and sometimes hard. The aim for this work is to create automated {{and easy to use}} tests for common security issues. The intended use of all tests is to make testing faster as well and easier and able to detect more possible issues. The main result from this thesis work is a set of tests implemented and integrated as part of Netrounds, which is a cloud-based network testing application. The result provides communication providers with intuitive and easy to use tests for assuring security for end-users in public access networks. The tests ultimately saves time during security assurance as well as helping in making the access network more secure. Major tests include testing that end-users cannot impersonate others, disturb the service, or access other users traffic. Each test focuses on security in common protocols and gives a pass or <b>fail</b> <b>status.</b> All implemented tests are tested extensively in multiple environments to ensure that they detect general issues and security problems. They are run giving good results performing security certification in access networks. Validerat; 20131004 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|E

In this work we present a methodology for detection and isolation of faults to hybrid control systems using a diagnoser. For this purpose a general framework is proposed. We discuss the notion of diagnosability of Hybrid Systems {{in the framework of}} Hybrid Input Output Automata (HIOA), imposing the conditions for a Hybrid System to be diagnosable. The diagnoser is designed using hybrid structure hypothesis tests. The states of the Hybrid System model reflect the normal and the <b>failed</b> <b>status</b> of the system components.

In this paper, I study the incentives and responses of schools that failed AYP once. Using data from the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction and regression discontinuity designs, I find evidence in these schools of improvements in high-stakes reading and spillover effects to low-stakes language arts. The patterns are consistent {{with a focus on}} marginal students around the high-stakes cutoff, but this improvement did not {{come at the expense of}} the ends. Meanwhile, there is little evidence of improvement in high-stakes math or in low-stakes science and social studies. Performance in low-stakes grades suffered, as did performance in weaker subgroups despite their inclusion in AYP computations. While there is no evidence of robust effects in either test participation or graduation, attendance improved in threatened schools where it mattered for AYP. Finally, there is strong evidence in favor of response to incentives: Schools that failed AYP only in reading and/or math subsequently did substantially better in those subject areas. Credibility of threat mattered. AYP-failed schools that faced more competition responded more strongly and also more broadly, robust evidence in favor of improvements in all AYP objectives.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of application of acoustic holographic analysis with statistical envelope analysis algorithm for vehicle side mirror power-fold (PF) noise diagnostic is explored. The {{aim of this}} paper is to establish whether the sound visualization contours derived from the measurements can be used as a basis for the power-fold quality differentiation, and whether the results of noise source localization can suggest the best locations for signal sensor placement(s). With use of the acoustic camera, the diagnostic algorithm of the statistical envelope analysis is developed and validated using a large number of power-fold actuators comprising of subjectively &# 039;good&# 039; and &# 039;bad&# 039; samples. These power-fold actuators were tested and measured for the sound pressure spectra over the 1 / 3 rd octave band over the frequency range up to 6300 Hz. Power-fold noise was measured by use of the microphone array. For given frequency limits of 1 / 3 rd octave bands, sound pressure levels are measured on given power-fold actuators, an envelope algorithm was formed for the subjectively &# 039;good&# 039; actuators, thus allowing to develop a quality control acceptance boundary envelope, with which, sound pressure spectrum amplitude of each individual actuator was compared. When the actuators have sound pressure spectrum amplitude curves falling within this boundary envelope, a pass status is obtained, and when the sound pressure spectrum amplitude curves stay outside of this envelope, a <b>fail</b> <b>status</b> is given...|$|E
40|$|Bison Gear and Engineering Corporation is a motor {{manufacturing}} company. To ensure quality, Bison must {{test the}} current through its manufactured motors {{to verify that}} they are in proper operating conditions. The designed product provides an automated solution to measuring motor current of the 560 and 562 series Hollow Shaft Offset Gear motors under emergency power conditions. The product is user friendly and efficient. It requires minimal operator input and automatically tests the motor in the clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. The system delivers a pass or fail to the operator, and archives serialized motor current data {{at the end of each}} test. The product also includes a user interface which allows the operator to observe the maximum current, current range, and the time remaining before a pass or fail result is delivered. The supervisor interface allows the client to access previously tested motor data. The client supervisor has the ability to generate a query based on the following parameters: pass, fail, date or motor id. The report will provide the client with the date the motor was tested, the maximum current in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, the current range in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions, and the pass or <b>fail</b> <b>status</b> of the motor. Accuracy of the current sensing circuitry is essential to ensuring the overall reliability of the final product as determined by the Failure Mode Effect Analysis.

At the end of the noise exposure, the audiological tests showed a worsening of the mean air and bone audiometric thresholds at the 2, 000 (1 / 10), 4, 000 (7 / 10), and 8, 000 Hz (6 / 10); a <b>fail</b> <b>status</b> of the TEOAE and DPOAE, which were previously present, in all the divers; temporary threshold shift, at the Peyser test, in 9 / 10 divers; discomfort for pulse tone presented at the TDT test, in all the divers; no post exposure significant differences at the Carhart and ABR tests, in any of the divers. Six months after the end of noise exposure, all the divers presented a complete recovery of their audio-vestibular functions.

While efforts are underway by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and other organizations to reform the emergency medical services (EMS) system, little data exists on the status of pediatric {{emergency care}} (PEC). To evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of out-of-hospital emergency physicians (EPs) in pediatric rapid assessment and resuscitation, and to identify areas of improvement to the pediatric EMS system and PEC education in the capital, Yerevan, a cross-sectional, anonymous, self-administered Knowledge and Attitudes survey regarding pediatric rapid assessment and resuscitation was distributed to all out-of-hospital EPs in Yerevan from August to September 2012. The response rate was 80 %. The majority (89. 7 %) failed the 10 -question knowledge test (pre-defined passing score of ≥ 7) with a mean score of 4. 17 ± 1. 99 SD. Answers regarding the relationship between pediatric cardiac arrest and respiratory issues, the compression ventilation ratio in neonates, the definition of hypotension, and recognition of shock were most frequently incorrect. None of the participants had attended pediatric specific continuing medical education (CME) in the last 5 years.

40|$|Formative {{assessment}} {{measures are}} commonly used in schools to assess early literacy skills as indicators of reading acquisition and to design instruction accordingly. The purpose {{of this research was}} to investigate the incremental predictive validity of formative assessment measures of reading comprehension. It was hypothesized that formative measures of reading comprehension will contribute more to our understanding of students 2 ̆ 7 overall reading abilities than simply Oral Reading Fluency (ORF). It was also hypothesized that these measures can be modeled in a meaningful way to explain student performance on criterion measures of academic competence. Four formative measures of reading comprehension [...] -Maze (MZ), Retell Fluency (RTF), Written Retell (WRT), and Sentence Verification Technique (SVT) [...] -were used to measure unique aspects of reading comprehension through production-type responses in an efficient and instructionally meaningful way. The Group Reading Assessment and Diagnostic Evaluation (GRADE) was used as a measure of overall reading proficiency while the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) was used as a measure of academic competence. Data were collected from 111 fourth grade students from two Western Massachusetts elementary schools. Four multiple regression equations were computed to test the hypothesis that measures of reading comprehension will contribute more to our understanding of reading proficiency than ORF alone. Each measure significantly predicted performance on GRADE above and beyond that predicted by ORF. A larger multiple regression equation was used to evaluate which measure predicted a unique and significant proportion of the variance in reading proficiency. The MZ, SVT and WRT were significant predictors in the model. Using the measures found to be significant with ORF, a logistic regression analysis was computed to evaluate how reliably the newly constructed model predicted a pass or <b>fail</b> <b>status</b> on the fourth grade English Language Arts section of MCAS.

This paper examines patterns of intra-organisational evolution and reform of Fianna Fáil as a party organisation before and after the 2011 Dáil election, widely considered an ‘earthquake election’ that fundamentally undermined Fianna <b>Fáil’s</b> <b>status</b> as the dominant party in the Irish party system. Electoral losses had triggered reform in Fianna Fáil prior to 2011, but such reforms tended to be minor, as the party expected its opposition status to be temporary. This orientation changed after 2011, as the party’s very foundation seemed threatened, having suffered a historic decline of its electoral support and membership. We argue that the post- 2011 re-orientation can be usefully characterised as a movement away from organisational characteristics associated with the ‘cartel model of party organisation’ towards characteristics echoing more ‘traditional mass party structures’, an organisational model less dependent on state resources, and more able to generate loyalty through organisational means. Whether the 2011 reforms will lead to lasting change is likely to depend on whether, and if so how quickly, Fianna Fáil can reclaim its position as the major party of government...|$|R

Somalia’s population in 2012 was estimated at 10, 195, 000 and the country has an area of 637, 657, square kilometres, its GDP in the same year was put at USD 1306.00. 6 The Somalis had developed intense contact with the Persian and Arab immigrants at early stages which shaped their lifestyle, language and culture immensely (Elmi 2010).|$|R
30|$|China, {{although}} a distant country, yet was affected severely by the piracy. A pointer {{in this case}} is the capture in November 2008 of two Chinese commercial ships by Somalian pirates and many Chinese taken as hostage. Not only that the fear of many more being captured and disrupting Chinese commercial traffic and sea lanes of communication loomed large prompting China to take steps to counter it. Noteworthy among the several steps taken by China since then, is to enhance Somalia’s capacity. For China, Somalia’s capacity building hence, is closely inter-twined with that of the security at the sea—for both the Somalians and China. Whereas the West sees Somalia and the problem of piracy as one associated with its <b>failed</b> <b>status</b> and the consequent threat posed by terrorist groups such as Al Shabaab, China’s approach is markedly different in that it has sought to engage with Somalia a la other African countries by building its capacity in order that piracy can no more thrive and thereby provide a stepping stone to strengthen its relationship with Somalia. A couple of issues comes out of this development (1) Chinese maritime economic interests cannot be compromised and (2) China is taking a more assertive role in international affairs without compromising its foreign policy principle of non-interference in internal affairs (Andrew and Strange 2013, p. 3).|$|R

Infarct size as determined by cardiac MRI has important therapeutic and prognostic information. MethodsTwenty six STEMI patients who had received thrombolytic therapy were subjected to cardiac MRI assessment at 5 – 7 day of admission. Base line variables of the study population were compared with the acute infarct size {{as determined by the}} Cardiac MRI. ResultsThe mean acute infarct size in our study population was 27. 2  ±  17. 4 % of LV. We found through univariate analysis that final infarct size was dependent on time to thrombolysis (p =  0. 04), Status of Thrombolysis (p =  0. 01), smoking status (p =  0. 02), location of infarct (p <  0. 00001), presence of microvascular obstruction (p =  0. 01) and viability status (p =  0. 0004). Thus, larger acute infarct size was seen in delayed time to thrombolysis, <b>failed</b> <b>status</b> of thrombolysis, smokers, anterior location of the infarct, presence of microvascular obstruction and non viable myocardial status. ConclusionInfarct size as determined by Cardiac MRI has been shown to carry important therapeutic and prognostic information. We have tried to evaluate predictors of acute infarct on cardiac MRI in STEMI patients during their initial hospital stay. Knowing the predictors of acute infarct size can help in early intervention and provide prognostic information for future cardiac events...|$|R
