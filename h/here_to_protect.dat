During the 12th century, the local seigneur Ridel (or Rideau) d'Azay, a knight in the service of Philip II Augustus, built a fortress <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the Tours to Chinon road where it crossed the river Indre.|$|E
2500|$|Porto Alegre {{lies in a}} {{transitional}} area between the subtropical forest and the Southern Brazilian grasslands (pampa). A number of conservation programmes have been established <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> native trees. Many of the city's avenues have been planted with different tree species. One striking {{example of this is}} Teresópolis Avenue, where bottle trees have been planted. The city is covered in green vegetation and Lapacho and Jacaranda are the main species that can be found here. The trees from the hills are protected. Two environmental conservation areas can be found in this city: [...] "Delta do Jacuí" [...] (Jacuí Delta) State Park and Lami Biological Reserve.|$|E
2500|$|Anna Walton as Princess Nuala: King Balor's {{daughter}} and Nuada's twin sister. She {{is described as}} [...] "very light" [...] while Nuada is [...] "very dark", creating a yin and yang dynamic. She elaborated on the incestuous tones between her character and Prince Nuada, [...] "He's the dark side and she's the light side and they're pulled apart and pulled back together again, and she's {{trying to get away}} because she knows there is something she has to do. He can't let that go and they can't really do anything without each other so it's a really interesting thing." [...] Her character also forms a relationship with Abe Sapien, and Walton noted their similarities, [...] "They are both slightly lost souls and they understand each other." [...] Walton spoke of her character's sense of purpose, [...] "She feels very strongly about what she has to do in the film, and then her absolute connection and love for the Earth and what we are given. That's what she's <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect...</b> Her relationship with her brother, and how he is almost a part of her but she has to break away and will {{do whatever it takes to}} stop him from achieving what he wants to achieve, which is the mass destruction of mankind." ...|$|E

2500|$|The spot {{advertising}} for the fictional United Trek Federation was {{a spot on}} Darker Projects, premiering on the sixth third-season episode of Star Trek: The Section 31 Files called Invasion, Part III - Warday. In this spot, an announcer says [...] "How many times does this happen to you?", followed by the two geeks downloading a possible new Star Trek episode ( [...] or Section 31) available. Instead, they stumbled upon Doctor Who, and attempts to free the computer unsuccessful as it detonated, marking [...] "another tragic act of computer terrorism {{at the hands of}} the Who World Order." [...] The announcer then asks: [...] "Do you wake up in the middle of the night, wondering today's the day the forces of the Who World Order will come knocking on your door, to drag you off to their Who Relocation Camps?" [...] It is then the United Trek Federation is introduced. What happens next is that a young woman (voiced by Kara Dennison) shouting her Trek DVDs have been stolen by some Dinomonster. This particular agent is being intercepted by the UTF agent who's there for her, and the stolen DVDs are recovered back. It concludes with the line: [...] "With the United Trek Federation, you can sleep easily. Knowing the monsters of the Who World Order have at last met their match. United Trek Federation. We are <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> you!" ...|$|E

50|$|Nyergesújfalu (Sattel-Neudorf) {{is a town}} in Komárom-Esztergom county, Hungary, in the Central Transdanubia region.The city, {{located near}} the river Danube, is an ancient site of habitation. It was located on the Crumerum, a major Roman trade and {{military}} route. Late-era Romans built a fort <b>here,</b> <b>to</b> help <b>protect</b> the northern border of their empire. The settlement was later overrun by various tribes and, later still, by invaders from the Ottoman Empire. In the periods of warfare the fort was destroyed.|$|R

5|$|The city's {{southern}} waterfront, {{away from}} the downtown core, is the location of many oil tanks, a docking station for a ferry boat, a non-profit sailing center, bars, strip clubs, and power plants. The Russian Submarine Museum was located here until 2008, when the submarine sank in a storm and was declared a loss. The Fox Point Hurricane Barrier is also found <b>here,</b> built <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> Providence from storm surge like that which it endured in the 1938 New England Hurricane and again in 1954 from Hurricane Carol.|$|R
50|$|Roussillon {{is famous}} for the rich {{deposits}} of ochre pigments found in the clay near the village.

Nowadays the mining of ochre is prohibited <b>here,</b> in order <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the sites from degradation or even complete destruction.|$|R
40|$|Image {{registration}} {{is the process}} of aligning two or more images of the same scene. A direct image registration approach uses Mutual Information (MI) as an image alignment. Mutual Information {{is a measure of the}} similarity of different images. It is robust, accurate and real-time for the both monomodal and multimodal images. It has the ability to perform robust alignment with illumination changes, multi-modality and occlusions. This method also helps to produce accurate image registration results in both monomodal and multimodal images. Time consumption is greatly reduced by this method. The optimization techniques used <b>here</b> are <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the Mutual Information cost function...|$|R

He said, [...] "It {{is the sort of}} thing which makes it hard {{for those of us who}} are <b>here</b> trying <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the governmental sovereignty of the state..." [...] At the time a federal anti-lynching bill was under consideration by Congress. It passed the House but it was defeated by the Solid South in the Senate. No one was ever prosecuted for the murders. Nazi Germany reported the lynching as propaganda to offset its anti-Semitic laws.|$|R

25|$|Manjampatti {{was given}} land for {{cultivation}} when the Reserved Forest was created {{and the families}} have kept their respective fields marked with the original stone boundaries. Villagers earlier practiced shifting cultivation, growing millets such as raagi, thinai and kambu. Later the Forest Department forbade shifting cultivation and restricted cultivation to the allotted lands. The crops now are rice in rainy season and butter beans otherwise, though with a more diverse population a few vegetables such as eggplant and tomatoes are grown. Farmers <b>here</b> have <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> their crops from wild elephants, gaur, wild boar, deer and sometimes peacocks. A complex and well maintained system of small canals distributes water from the Manalar to irrigate the fields.|$|R
5000|$|This verse {{introduces}} Joseph of Arimathea, who {{is found}} in all four gospels. None of them give many details about this figure, but in later years extensive legends about who he was have developed. Kenner notes that other scholars have noticed a parallel between Joseph <b>here</b> appearing <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> Jesus' body, just as Joseph, the husband of Mary, protected the infant Jesus in Matthew 2. Keener does not place much weight on this parallelism. In the other gospels Joseph does not play much of {{a role in the}} infancy narrative, but Joseph of Arimathea still appears. Joseph was also a very common name at the time. [...] The historicity of Joseph's role in Jesus' burial is debated among scholars. He is not mentioned outside the gospels, and Acts 13:29 can be read to imply that Jesus was buried by the governing forces.|$|R
50|$|The Slavards live in long, low-roofed log cabins, with roofs {{covered in}} grass or sodden earth. Packed earthen floors, wooden benches for sitting and {{sleeping}}, glowing hearths, and {{sheep and goats}} sleeping under the roof with their owners during severe frosts - Slavard dwellings can hardly be called places of comfort. Their houses are heated with chimneyless stoves, to make matters worse. Slavards prefer to sleep outside whenever the weather permits. The braces of their doubly-sloped roofs are usually decorated with depictions of animal heads. The shutters on their windows are also covered with stylized carvings depicting waves or plants of the sea. A Slavard's yard is generally enclosed by a fence or palisade wall. Human skulls are often seen hanging over the gates, the skulls of the ancestors of those who now live <b>here,</b> elevated <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the inhabitants from misfortune, frost, and evildoers.|$|R

40|$|The Large Hadron Collider {{built at}} CERN now enters a {{starting-up}} phase where the present design luminosity up to 1034 cm- 2 s- 1 will be reached after the running in phase. A possible upgrading {{of the machine}} to luminosity up to 10 ^ 35  cm^- 2 s^- 1 requires a new insertion region design, and will be implemented in essentially two phases. The energy from collision debris is deposited in the insertion regions and in particular in the superconducting magnet coils with a possible risk of quench. We describe <b>here</b> how <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> the interaction region magnets against this irradiation to keep the energy deposition below critical values estimated for safe operation. The constraint {{is to keep the}} absorber size as small as possible to leave most of the magnet aperture available for the beam. This can be done by choosing a suitable material and design minimizing the load on the cryogenic system.
