40|$|Limb {{shortening}} in poliomyelitis {{in children}} with paralysis in unilateral lower limb {{gives rise to a}} <b>discrepancy</b> in length of the lower limb which causes limping. Based on the impression that the degree of the <b>discrepancy</b> was related to the degree of paralysis, a study on shortening in 55 adults with paralysis in unilateral limb was made. The degree of paralysis was determined by using manual muscle testing in hip flexors, hip extensors, hip abductors, hip adductors, knee flexors, knee extensors, ankle dorsal flexors and ankle plantar flexors. The total muscle strength was computed by adding the numerical strength of the 8 muscle groups. On the other hand, the <b>discrepancy</b> was determined by clinical measurement from the anterior superior iliac spine to the tip of medial malleolus in the lower extremities, and the relative shortening was expressed as the "Index of <b>discrepancy</b> in length of the lower extremities", which was obtained by dividing the <b>discrepancy</b> by the length of the normal lower extremity multiplied by 100. The correlation between the index of the <b>discrepancy</b> and total muscle strength was statistically significant. Moreover, the correlation between the index of the <b>discrepancy</b> and hip muscle strength, knee muscle strength and ankle muscle strength were all statistically significant. To predict the index of the <b>discrepancy</b> in adult life, a regression equation of the index of the <b>discrepancy</b> against total muscle strength was set forth. A regression equation of the <b>discrepancy</b> against total muscle strength for prediction of the <b>discrepancy</b> at adult life was made. A 95 % confidence region of these regression equations was taken to predict individual values of both the index of the <b>discrepancy</b> and the <b>discrepancy</b> at adult life. However, the deviation was extensive and prediction using these regression equations could not be made. A 95 % confidence region of these regression equations was taken to predict the average values of both the index of the <b>discrepancy</b> and the <b>discrepancy.</b> These intervals were narrow and these regression equations may be of use in predicting the index of the <b>discrepancy</b> and the <b>discrepancy</b> at adult life.

40|$|AbstractThe linear <b>discrepancy</b> {{problem is}} to round a given [0, 1]-vector x to a binary vector y such that the {{rounding}} error {{with respect to a}} linear form is small, i. e., such that ||A(x−y) ||∞ is small for some given matrix A. The combinatorial <b>discrepancy</b> problem is the special case of x=(12,…, 12) t. A famous result of Beck and Spencer [Math. Programming 30 (1984) 88] as well as Lovász et al. [European J. Combin. 7 (1986) 151] shows that the linear <b>discrepancy</b> problem is not much harder than this special case: Any linear <b>discrepancy</b> problem can be solved with at most twice the maximum rounding error among the <b>discrepancy</b> problems of the submatrices of A. In this paper, we strengthen this result for the common situation that the <b>discrepancy</b> of submatrices having n 0 columns is bounded by Cn 0 α for some C> 0, α∈] 0, 1]. In this case, we improve the constant by which the general problem is harder than the <b>discrepancy</b> one from 2 down to 2 (23) α. We also find that a random vector has expected linear <b>discrepancy</b> 2 (12) αCnα only. Hence in the typical situation that the <b>discrepancy</b> is decreasing for smaller matrices, the linear <b>discrepancy</b> problem is even less difficult compared to the <b>discrepancy</b> one than assured by previous results. We also obtain the bound lindisc(A,x) ⩽ 2 (2 α/(21 −α− 1)) C||x|| 1 α. Our proofs use a reduction to Pusher–Chooser games...|$|R
40|$|Tanenbaum, Trenk, and Fishburn {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} linear <b>discrepancy</b> in 2001, proposing {{it as a way}} to measure a partially ordered set's distance from being a linear order. In addition to proving a number of results about linear <b>discrepancy,</b> they posed eight challenges and questions for future work. This dissertation completely resolves one of those challenges and makes contributions on two others. This dissertation has three principal components: 3 -discrepancy irreducible posets of width 3, degree bounds, and online algorithms for linear <b>discrepancy.</b> The first principal component of this dissertation provides a forbidden subposet characterization of the posets with linear <b>discrepancy</b> equal to 2 by completing the determination of the posets that are 3 -irreducible with respect to linear <b>discrepancy.</b> The second principal component concerns degree bounds for linear <b>discrepancy</b> and weak <b>discrepancy,</b> a parameter similar to linear <b>discrepancy.</b> Specifically, if every point of a poset is incomparable to at most D other points of the poset, we prove three bounds: the linear <b>discrepancy</b> of an interval order is at most D, with equality if and only if it contains an antichain of size D; the linear <b>discrepancy</b> of a disconnected poset is at most the greatest integer less than or equal to (3 D- 1) / 2; and the weak <b>discrepancy</b> of a poset is at most D. The third principal component of this dissertation incorporates another large area of research, that of online algorithms. We show that no online algorithm for linear <b>discrepancy</b> can be better than 3 -competitive, even for the class of interval orders. We also give a 2 -competitive online algorithm for linear <b>discrepancy</b> on semiorders and show that this algorithm is optimal. Ph. D.

40|$|The {{arguments}} on self <b>discrepancy</b> {{can be traced}} back to the old ages, but the systematic investigations were started by Higgins et al. at 1985. Compared to the large number of foreign studies, only a few ones have been conducted in our own country. Numerous characteristics of undergruaduate’s actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> and a great many determinative factors have been found as well as many of its negative effects—especially the greater the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy,</b> the more negative on the mind and behavior. Nevertheless, there are still many issues to be solved, such as the extend of the undergruaduate’s actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> level in own country. On the other hand, although there are a great many internal and external determinative factors of actual-ideal <b>discrepancy,</b> how they overally influence the <b>discrepancy</b> of the same individual is still unknown; to what extent does actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> influence the human mind and behavior and whether the influence is positive or negtive? This research collected a sample consisting of 4 undergraduate grades and 5 majors from a middle-ranked university. We adopted questionnaires in the study, and analyzed the data using correlation analysis, regression analysis, variances analysis, and path analysis. Our aim focused on the general characteristics of the undergruaduate’s actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> in own country, the overall working mechanism of the determinative factors including environmental and personal factors on the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> of the same individual, and the effects of the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> on psychological adaption, motivation, and behavior. The main results are as following: (1) The improved measurement instrument possesses good validity and reliability, and can be used in future research. (2) The actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> level among undergraduates is slightly bellow medium. The proportion of undergraduates who have a higher actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> level is small. There is significant gender difference in actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> level, but no significant difference across different majors and grades. (3) This research probed the overall working mechanism of the parenting style(environmental factors) and the personality factors(personal factors) including stability, flexibility, cleverness, and esteem on the undergruaduate’s actual-ideal <b>discrepancy.</b> The results shows that the parenting style of warmth and understanding, stability, flexibility, and esteem influence the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy.</b> Esteem entirely moderate the relationship between the parenting style of warmth and understanding and actual-ideal <b>discrepancy,</b> partially moderate the relationship between the flexibility, stability and actual-ideal <b>discrepancy.</b> Furthermore, the above factors can be order as stability, flexibility, and parenting style of warmth and understanding in terms of decreasing impact on the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy.</b> No significant effect of cleverness and other parenting style was found. The parenting style of warmth and understanding, stability, and flexibility interactively influence the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> in the following manner: the stability and flexibility, both of which have independent influence on the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy,</b> entirely moderate the relationship between the parenting style of warmth and understanding and actual-ideal <b>discrepancy.</b> (4) Actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> plays a negative role in adaption indices, including self-efficacy, self-identity, self-actualization. Actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> also has negative effects on the 9 symptoms measured by SCL- 90, vitality, approach motivation, avoidance motivation, and performance goals. No significant influence on mastering goals was found. Actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> uniquely correlates with depression symptom. The above results contribute from the point of self-discrepancy to the understanding of self-identity of undergraduates, and they enrich the knowledge of the development of self and contribute to the understanding of the development of human personality. This research advances on the two key problems of the developmental mechanism of actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> and that promotes the knowledge of the developmental mechanism of actual-ideal <b>discrepancy.</b> The research probed the relationship between the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> and motivation which is an important phenomenon and this enlarges the domain of the actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> research. The results make sure that actual-ideal <b>discrepancy</b> is one of the important factors influencing undergruaduate’s mind and behavior. The conclusions can provide reference and guidance in the diagnosis and intervension strategies for mental health education and counseling practice in university. 关于自我差异的相关观点由来已久，但是系统地研究自我差异还是从Higgins等人(1985) 开始的。目前大部分研究来自国外，国内的研究较少。研究者们开展的大量研究发现了大学生现实—理想差异的很多特点，以及影响现实—理想差异的众多因素，也发现了现实—理想差异的许多消极影响——特别是现实—理想差异越大，则心理和行为越消极。但是，已有的研究还存在一些问题，如，我国大学生现实—理想差异的水平是高还是低？影响现实—理想差异有各种内外因素，但这些因素是如何对同一个体的现实—理想差异产生作用的？现实—理想差异又是在何等程度上对人们的心理、行为产生影响的？这种影响是消极的还是积极的？ 该研究选取某中等水平的综合性大学的四个年级几个有代表性的专业的学生，采取问卷法进行调查研究，采取相关分析、回归分析、方差分析、路径分析等统计方法处理数据，主要探讨三个问题：当前我国大学生现实—理想差异的一般特点，各种环境因素、个人因素对同一个体现实—理想差异的整体作用机制、现实—理想差异对各种心理适应及有关动机、行为的效应。主要结果如下： （ 1 ）新改进的现实—理想差异测量工具具有较好的效度和信度，可作为进一步研究的工具。 （ 2 ）大学生现实—理想差异略低于中等水平；有较大现实—理想差异的人数比例较小；大学生现实—理想差异存在显著的性别差异但年级差异和专业差异不显著。 （ 3 ）该研究探查了家庭教养方式（环境因素）以及稳定性、灵活性、聪慧性、自尊等人格因素（个人因素）对大学生现实—理想差异的整体作用机制，结果表明，温暖理解教养方式、稳定性、灵活性、自尊对现实—理想差异的产生有重要影响，其中，自尊在温暖理解教养方式与现实—理想差异的关系中起完全中介作用，在灵活性、稳定性与现实—理想差异的关系中起部分中介作用。按作用大小而言，稳定性的作用最大，灵活性的作用次之，温暖理解教养方式的作用最小，聪慧性和其他教养方式对现实—理想差异无显著影响。就温暖理解教养方式、稳定性、灵活性怎样互相交织着影响现实—理想差异而言，温暖理解教养方式以稳定性、灵活性为完全中介对现实—理想差异起作用，稳定性、灵活性都对现实—理想差异有独立的作用。 （ 4 ）现实—理想差异在自我效能、自我认同、自我实现等心理适应指标上有消极效应，在用SCL- 90 所测量的 9 种心理症状上有消极效应，在活力行为、接近或回避动机、成就目标上同样有消极效应，但对掌握目标无显著影响。现实—理想差异与抑郁症状单独相关。 上述结果从自我差异的角度增进了人们对大学生有关自我认同的认识，丰富了个体自我发展的知识，进而增进了对人类个性发展的认识。该研究在关于现实—理想差异产生机制的两个关键问题上取得进展，使人们对现实—理想差异的产生机制的认识前进了一步。该研究还探讨了现实—理想差异与动机这一重要心理现象的关系，拓宽了现实—理想差异的研究领域。 研究结果肯定了现实—理想差异是影响大学生心理、行为的一个重要因素，其结论可为大学生心理健康教育、心理咨询实践提供诊断、干预策略的参考和指导...|$|R

It was suggested that the <b>discrepancy</b> approach was inaccurate, and information drawn from the <b>discrepancy</b> approach was not useful to develop an educational plan. However, these criticisms are not necessarily true for the original concept of the <b>discrepancy</b> approach. This paper addresses the original concept of the <b>discrepancy</b> approach. Bateman suggested that the measurement of intelligence-achievement <b>discrepancy</b> {{was the first step}} of LD diagnosis, and the second step, examination of cognitive characteristics and skills, had to follow the measurement of <b>discrepancy.</b> In the second step, ITPA(Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities) was often used. However, the first step was overemphasized when the <b>discrepancy</b> approach was widely adopted. This is because accurate judgment of LD was focused to allow the proper use of special education budget, and the decline of ITPA led to a decline in the second step, which led to overemphasis on the first step. This study yielded a number of insights regarding LD diagnosis. First, intelligence-achievement <b>discrepancy</b> represents only a limited part of LD diagnosis, and more particular measurement of individual ability must follow that. Second, a method is required to detect children with LD. Without such a method, the <b>discrepancy</b> approach cannot work adequately...|$|R
