5|$|On 15 September 1940, {{known as}} the Battle of Britain Day, an RAF pilot, Ray Holmes of No. 504 Squadron RAF rammed a German bomber he {{believed}} was going to bomb the Palace. Holmes {{had run out of}} ammunition and made the quick decision to ram it. Holmes bailed out. Both aircraft crashed. In fact the Dornier Do 17 bomber was empty. It had already been damaged, two of its crew had been killed and the remainder bailed out. Its pilot, Feldwebel Robert Zehbe, landed, only to die later of wounds suffered during the attack. During the Dornier's descent, <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> unloaded its bombs, one of which hit the Palace. It then crashed into the forecourt of London Victoria station. The bomber's engine was later exhibited at the Imperial War Museum in London. The British pilot became a King's Messenger after the war, and {{died at the age of}} 90 in 2005.|$|E
25|$|Anguilla has {{habitat for}} the Cuban tree frogs (Osteopilus septentrionalis). The red-footed {{tortoise}} (Chelonoidis carbonaria) is {{a species of}} tortoise found here, <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> came from South America. Hurricanes led to over-water dispersal for the green iguanas (Iguana iguana) to colonise Anguilla. All three animals are introduced.|$|E
25|$|In 1848 Young left Tennants', and in {{partnership}} with his friend and assistant Edward Meldrum, set up a small business refining the crude oil. The new oils were successful, but the supply of oil from the coal mine soon began to fail (eventually being exhausted in 1851). Young, noticing that the oil was dripping from the sandstone roof of the coal mine, theorised that <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> originated from the action of heat on the coal seam and from this thought {{that it might be}} produced artificially.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook {{control in}} the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51-49 {{majority}} in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, {{it would have been easy}} for the Democrats to have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote on the Senate floor, if <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> came to that. As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.|$|E
500|$|Considering {{the idea}} of the fission bomb {{theoretically}} settled—at least until more experimental data was available—the Berkeley conference then turned in a different direction. Edward Teller pushed for discussion of a more powerful bomb: the [...] "super", now usually referred to as a [...] "hydrogen bomb", which would use the explosive force of a detonating fission bomb to ignite a nuclear fusion reaction in deuterium and tritium. Teller proposed scheme after scheme, but Bethe refused each one. The fusion idea was put aside to concentrate on producing fission bombs. Teller also raised the speculative possibility that an atomic bomb might [...] "ignite" [...] the atmosphere because of a hypothetical fusion reaction of nitrogen nuclei. Bethe calculated that it could not happen, and a report co-authored by Teller showed that [...] "no self-propagating chain of nuclear reactions is likely to be started." [...] In Serber's account, Oppenheimer mentioned it to Arthur Compton, who [...] "didn't have enough sense to shut up about it. <b>It</b> <b>somehow</b> got into a document that went to Washington" [...] and was [...] "never laid to rest".|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Garcia posted several {{videos of}} his inmates' {{performances}} on YouTube {{in hopes of}} inspiring other prisons {{to learn from the}} experience. The clips became some of the most talked about in cyberspace. The most popular of the videos was uploaded in April 2007. It showed over 1,500 male inmates imitating the zombie dance featured in the music video of Michael Jackson's [...] "Thriller". The prisoners wore their orange jail-issue jumpsuits during the performance in the jail's exercise yard. The Los Angeles Times later commented that the dance moves were not lifted directly from the video, [...] "but they are performed with such precision <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> seems that they must have been". Inmate Crisanto Nierre played the role of Michael Jackson. Nierre, who at the time was awaiting trial on drug charges, has been a fan of Jackson since he was in a dance troupe at high school. USA Today noted that his favorite Jackson tracks were [...] "Bad" [...] and [...] "Smooth Criminal". Former pizza chef Wenjiel Resane, who is gay, played the part of Jackson's girlfriend. At the time, Resane had already been at the prison for three years, also awaiting trial on drug charges.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} {{has been}} positive towards the song. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic named it a [...] "track pick" [...] from the album. In {{a review of}} the album, Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani hailed it as [...] "a joyous composition". Michael Hubbard of musicOMH called it [...] "pure pop genius," [...] saying the track [...] "steals the show". Gary Crossing from Dotmusic described the song as a [...] "Sexy, bass-heavy monster of a floor-filler with cheesy synths, robotic voices and whispers aplenty" [...] while complimenting the [...] "I like to singy singy singy". This view was shared by Victoria Segal from NME who complimented Ahmadzaï's production technique and blending disco sounds with vocoder effects. She added that the song is [...] "so heavily distorted, the macho disco bassline is so quick to get its shirt off and the baby oil on, <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> sounds cool." [...] Barry Walters from Rolling Stone called the song [...] "improvisional", and described it as [...] " [...] like a rock rocket ship, then [...] while a digitally tweaked [...] squeaks". David Browne from Entertainment Weekly called the verses of [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] as Madonna's [...] "dippiest lyrics in ages", and also complimented Ahmadzaï's fusion of hard disco beats and contorting Madonna's vocals. Greg Kot from Chicago Tribune credited Madonna for paying homage to dance music with [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] and explaining that: ...|$|E

But we {{encourage}} users to report anything that is racist or objectionable. The JIDF claimed the [...] "Israel is not a Country" [...] group was antisemitic and mobilized supporters to complain to Facebook {{in an effort to}} have it deleted. After Facebook refused to shut the group down, the JIDF said <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> took control of the group in July 2008.|$|E

2500|$|On 9 April 2010, Harrison won {{the vacant}} EBU belt against old foe Michael Sprott at Alexandra Palace. He knocked out Sprott {{in the final}} round despite being behind on all three judges scorecards. Harrison claimed he {{sustained}} a shoulder injury early in the fight and had to carry on single-handed. BBC Sport said of the fight: [...] "Having come within seconds of a defeat that would have made a mockery of pre-fight assertions that he could face one of the Klitschko brothers for a world title, Harrison said: 'I had to win <b>it</b> <b>somehow.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Elvii is a {{registered}} trade name that belongs to the Elvis Extravaganza Fan Club. It is not a plural for the form Elvi in Elvis impersonators (this, however, is not grammatically correct, as the name [...] "Elvis" [...] derives from Old English. Even if <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> were a third-declension Latin noun, the plural form would be Elvēs). [...] This term was popularized by a Saturday Night Live sketch where Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi respectively impersonated the younger and older versions of Elvis. The term Elvira (plural, Elviras) {{has been used to}} refer to female Elvis impersonators.|$|E
2500|$|On August 5, 1926, while {{traveling}} in the Humboldt Mountains of Tibet's Kokonor region, Russian explorer Nicholas Roerich reported, members of his expedition saw [...] "something big and shiny reflecting the sun, like a huge oval moving at great speed. Crossing our camp the thing changed in its direction from south to southwest. And we saw how it disappeared in the intense blue sky. We even had time to take our field glasses and saw quite distinctly an oval form with shiny surface, one side of which was brilliant from the sun." [...] Another description by Roerich was of a [...] "shiny body flying from north to south. Field glasses are at hand. It is a huge body. One side glows in the sun. It is oval in shape. Then <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> turns in another direction and disappears in the southwest." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} named the 11th best {{psychedelic}} album of 2015 by Redefine magazine, with writer Thad McKraken stating that Weird Owl [...] "doesn’t do anything particularly well, and yet, <b>it’s</b> <b>somehow</b> arranged with such a concise precision that it rules". In regards to Weird Owl's discography, Jeff Treppel of Decibel called the album [...] "the finest LP of their career".|$|R
5000|$|The Beat Review {{gave the}} song 4 out of 5 stars saying that [...] "It’s an {{emotional}} track that catches every emotion of everybody who hears <b>it.</b> <b>It’s</b> <b>somehow</b> about being “perfect” as Daniel sings, “It took something perfect, to paint it red”. Along with the impressive arrangement, Daniel’s soulful, raspy vocals ventures {{into the whole}} track {{making it one of}} his finest".|$|R

2500|$|It {{is quite}} common for members of a company to {{supplement}} the corporate constitution with additional arrangements, such as shareholders' agreements, whereby they agree to exercise their membership rights in a certain way. [...] Conceptually a shareholders' agreement fulfills {{many of the same}} functions as the corporate constitution, but because it is a contract, it will not normally bind new members of the company unless they accede to <b>it</b> <b>somehow.</b> [...] One benefit of shareholders' agreement is that they will usually be confidential, as most jurisdictions do not require shareholders' agreements to be publicly filed. Another common method of supplementing the corporate constitution is by means of voting trusts, although these are relatively uncommon outside the United States and certain offshore jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions consider the company seal {{to be a part of}} the [...] "constitution" [...] (in the loose sense of the word) of the company, but the requirement for a seal has been abrogated by legislation in most countries.|$|E
2500|$|Manohla Dargis {{called it}} [...] "hugely likable" [...] {{with a story}} arc {{structured}} [...] "more or less" [...] as [...] "a long beginning and then an ending"; she calls Jim Henson's Creature Shop's Vogons [...] "beautifully constructed" [...] and noted that Sam Rockwell's performance is [...] "sensational, ... riffing on Elvis and the current President George Bush". Peter Bradshaw gave the film three stars out of five and said, [...] "The film is no disgrace, and honours the Guide's gentle, low-tech BBC origins. But it doesn't {{do justice to the}} open-ended inventiveness of the original. The inevitable Anglo-American accommodations of casting have muddled its identity and the performances of the new American stars can be uneasy. <b>It</b> <b>somehow</b> seems heavier-footed and slower-moving than Adams's concept; the gravity is stronger... The [...] and flavour of the Adams original, its playfully ruminative feel, has been downgraded in favour of a jolly but less interesting outerspace romp." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joe Amarante of the New Haven Register said he [...] "laughed {{several times}} during this cable comedy", and {{described}} it as [...] "'Monty Python' meets a Mike Myers' movie with a lead who looks like Ben Stiller". Curt Wagner of RedEye said he enjoyed the episode and the jokes that combined old and modern elements, like when Loquasto calls Krod master and he replies, [...] "You're making a PR nightmare for me". Wagner said of the show, [...] "The {{rest of the time}} the humor is just juvenile, but <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> works for this show, and this network, and apparently the mood I was in when I watched it." [...] Scott Thill of Wired magazine called the episode a mix between Rowan Atkinson's Blackadder and Mel Brooks' , and described it as [...] "a cable comedy perfectly suited for the male demographic". Thill also compared it to Korgoth of Barbaria, the cult hit Adult Swim pilot television episode parodying Conan the Barbarian, Matt Fowler of IGN said the show was [...] "not uproarious, (but) it's not painful to watch either", but said the characters had a [...] "one joke" [...] feel to them and expressed doubt as to whether they could sustain an entire series. Fowler identified Lucas as the stand-out cast member. Verne Gay of Newsday gave the episode a [...] "thumbs sideways", and praised the performances of Hart and especially Lucas. But the review also said the show needed to become funnier to laugh: [...] "there's definitely some funny here, but not nearly enough".|$|E

[...] Hetfield has also said that, of all parts of [...] "The Unforgiven," [...] this is his favourite. Robert Trujillo said [...] "it's got a great flow and it's very dynamic. <b>It's</b> <b>somehow</b> connected to the remaining body music of the album." ...|$|R

It doesn't quite develop its own identity. And <b>it's</b> <b>somehow</b> {{inevitable}} that Dame Evie's hilarious swearing and opinionating fade away as sentimentality takes over. But it's a great turn from Julie Walters, and a likable film." ...|$|R
2500|$|Kirsten {{told police}} he went to Cornell’s room at 12:15a.m., but couldn't access the locked room. He then had a {{telephone}} conversation with Vicky Cornell. [...] "I told Vicky that they wouldn’t come {{open the door and}} she told me to kick it open. I did. Upon entry, I found the bedroom door locked. I called the hotel operator and told her that I needed security to open the bedroom door. They refused again, and I told them that I’m going to damage the hotel room and (they) need to send security, call 911 and call an ambulance. I kicked the bedroom door 6-7 times before <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> popped open. I went inside and the bathroom door was partially opened and I could see his feet." [...] Kirsten told police in a signed statement. Kirsten said that Vicky {{was on the phone with}} him the whole time asking for updates, [...] "She told me that she called the front desk and they hung up on her. It was a female. She called back a couple minutes later and a male answered, saying that it was (the first) that he was hearing about the incident." [...] Kirsten said in his statement that he loosened the band around Cornell's neck then tried to resuscitate him by compressing his chest. Medical personnel arrived at 12:56 a.m and tried to resuscitate the singer with no success. Cornell was pronounced dead at 1:30a.m., an hour and 15 minutes after his bodyguard was first contacted by Cornell's wife. It's unknown how long it took the bodyguard to gain entry to the hotel room and find Cornell.|$|E
2500|$|According to Sharon Eberson of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, [...] "Stargate SG-1's" [...] {{place in}} the sci-fi {{universe}} {{can be measured in}} longevity, spot-on cast chemistry, rabid fans and tough subject it has tackled although she argued that the show was rarely a critical darling. Although the show was the most-watched program on Showtime, it received almost no media mention outside hard-core science fiction circles in its first seasons. Stargate SG-1 gained media attention when Stargate Atlantis was greenlit (the cover of the July 26, 2003 TV Guide issue notably called to [...] "Forget Trek! Stargate SG-1 is now sci-fi's biggest hit!"), but the Toronto Star noted in 2006 that [...] "Nobody seemed to like [...] but the fans; <b>it</b> <b>somehow</b> always slipped under the radar of most TV critics". According to Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, SG-1 records did not earn it [...] "the kind of wide-ranging respect a successful series with a 200-episode run deserves"; SG-1 rarely occupied a slot on 'best show' lists because the show remained [...] "relegated {{to the back of the}} bus in terms of popularity" [...] behind the glory of Battlestar Galactica, although every week, the show attracts an average of 10 million viewers worldwide. It has also been pointed out by Cooper that [...] "By the way, neither did the original 'Star Trek' in its time, It wasn't until 30 years later that people started looking back at it and realizing it was a milestone. I think we secretly hope that 10, 15, 20 years from now, that 'Stargate' will be considered in the same way." [...] Scott D. Pierce from Deseret News said that the series never made a [...] "sort of cultural impact" [...] as Star Trek because the show was [...] "pretty derivative" [...] which he further stated it became [...] "more so over the years." [...] Robert Hanks from the British newspaper The Independent said that the series [...] "Did the job" [...] during its second season of broadcasting.|$|E
