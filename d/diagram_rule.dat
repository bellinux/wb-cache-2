The question of ultraviolet divergences is one of the oldest concerns in the subject of quantum gravity.

We demonstrate how the increase of transferred energies in these reactions opens a complete new window in studying the microscopic nuclear structure at small distances. The simplifications in theoretical descriptions associated with the increase of the energies are discussed. The theoretical framework for calculation of high energy nuclear reactions based on the effective Feynman <b>diagram</b> <b>rules</b> is described in details. The result of this approach is the generalized eikonal approximation (GEA), which is reduced to Glauber approximation when nucleon recoil is neglected. The method of GEA is demonstrated in the calculation of high energy electro-disintegration of the deuteron and A = 3 targets. Subsequently we generalize the obtained formulae for A> 3 nuclei. The relation of GEA to the Glauber theory is analyzed. Then based on the GEA framework we discuss some of the phenomena which can be studied in exclusive reactions, these are: nuclear transparency and short-range correlations in nuclei. We illustrate how light-cone dynamics of high-energy scattering emerge naturally in high energy electro-nuclear reactions. I...|$|R

These rocks are mainly distinguished as two {{groups based on}} geographical, petrological and isotopic data: a) the east-central western group (E-CW) and b) the south western group (SW). The absence of contemporaneous basic volcanics in the Almopia area coupled with the considerable scatter of elements in variation <b>diagrams</b> <b>rule</b> out fractional crystallization as the dominant differentiation process. Instead, disequilibrium textures along with the positive correlation of Sr-isotope ratios with differentiation suggest mixing between a basic and an acid component combined with assimilation and fractionation.

Previous data on the oxygen isotope composition of the same volcanics are consistent with this genetic hypothesis.
