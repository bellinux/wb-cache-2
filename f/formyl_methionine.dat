40|$|AbstractWe have cloned {{the gene}} {{encoding}} Desulfovibrio gigas ferredoxin using a photodigoxigenin-labelled probe synthesized with the polymerase chain reaction. The DNA {{sequence of the}} gene predicts a polypeptide of 58 residues after removal of the initial <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine</b> (polypeptide Mr = 6, 276). The ferredoxin gene was expressed in aerobically grown E. coli behind the lac promoter of pUC 18 resulting in {{a high level of}} ferredoxin expression which comprises about 10 % of the total cell protein. EPR analysis of recombinant ferredoxin revealed the presence of a [3 Fe- 4 S] cluster which is characteristic of native D. gigas ferredoxin II...|$|E
40|$|Five {{species of}} tRNAs bearing two {{different}} fluorescent groups were synthesized. These were suitable for intramolecular distance measurements by singlet-singlet energy transfer. The efficiency of energy transfer was determined from the sensitized emission {{of the energy}} acceptor. With {{the assumption that the}} relative orientation of donor and acceptor is random, the apparent distances between the 5 ′-end and the 3 ′-end, the 4 -thiouridine and the 3 ′-end, the pseudouridine and 3 ′-end, the pseudouridine and the dihydrouridine in Escherichia coli <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine</b> tRNA, and between the 2 -thiouridine (in the anticodon) and the 3 ′-end in E. coli glutamate tRNA were calculated to be 24 Å, 38 Å, 55 Å, 36 Å, and > 65 Å, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Polyoma virus mRNA, {{isolated}} from the cytoplasm of 3 T 6 cells late after infection and purified by hybridization to HpaII fragment 3 of polyoma virus DNA, was separated on 50 % formamide-containing sucrose density gradients, and the fractionated RNA was recovered and translated in vitro. Analysis of the cell-free products showed that the minor virion protein VP 3 was synthesized from an mRNA sedimenting at approximately 18 S betweeen the 19 S VP 2 mRN and the 16 S VP 1 mRNA. Other experiments showed that the VP 2 and VP 3 can be labeled with <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine</b> from initiator tRNA. We conclude {{that there are three}} late polyoma virus mRNA's, each directing the synthesis of only one viral capsid protein...|$|E
50|$|Once protein {{synthesis}} is accomplished, the <b>formyl</b> group on <b>methionine</b> {{can be removed}} by peptide deformylase. The methionine residue can be further removed by the enzyme methionine aminopeptidase.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of the <b>formyl</b> group to <b>methionine</b> is catalyzed by the enzyme methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase. This modification is done after methionine has been loaded onto tRNAfMet by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase.|$|R
50|$|Methionine {{itself can}} be loaded either onto tRNAfMet or tRNAMet. However, transformylase will {{catalyze}} {{the addition of the}} <b>formyl</b> group to <b>methionine</b> only if methionine has been loaded onto tRNAfMet, not onto tRNAMet.|$|R
40|$|E. coli fMet-tRNAfMEet and E. coli RNA plymerase (RNA nucleotidyltransferase; EC 2. 7. 7. 6; nucleoside-triphosphate:RNA nucleotidyltransferase) form a 1 : 1 complex with an {{apparent}} association constant of 9. 0 X 10 (6) M- 1 at 37 degrees. The affinity of polymerase to tRNA {{depends on the}} tRNA {{as well as the}} <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine</b> moiety. Core polymerase has a greatly reduced affinity for initiator tRNA. Optimal binding conditions are similar to those that are also optimal for binding initiator tRNA to ribosomes. Binding of initiator tRNA to polymerase stimulates the transcription of lambda plac DNA, as determined in a crude cell-free system for beta-galactosidase (EC 3. 2. 1. 23; beta-D-galactoside galactohydrolase) synthesis as well as in a highly purified transcription system...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} individual mitochondrial tRNAs from {{a petite}} mutant OI-P 2 - 1 known {{to contain a}} limited subset of mitochondrial tRNA genes and have mapped these genes on the wild type genome of the yeast strains MH 41 - 7 B and D 273 - 10 B. To obtain DNA for fine structure mapping and DNA sequence analysis of these genes, we screened a yeast mitochondrial DNA-pBR 322 recombinant bank with the isolated tRNAs. We report here the fine structure mapping of recombinant clones containing the tryptophan, <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine</b> and proline tRNA genes {{as well as the}} DNA sequence of the proline tRNA gene. The combination of restriction mapping and DNA sequence analysis has enabled us to locate these genes precisely on the wild type genome and to determine their direction of transcription...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAs nascent polypeptides exit ribosomes, {{they are}} engaged {{by a series}} of processing, targeting, and folding factors. Here, we present a {{selective}} ribosome profiling strategy that enables global monitoring of when these factors engage polypeptides in the complex cellular environment. Studies of the Escherichia coli chaperone trigger factor (TF) reveal that, though TF can interact with many polypeptides, β-barrel outer-membrane proteins are the most prominent substrates. Loss of TF leads to broad outer-membrane defects and premature, cotranslational protein translocation. Whereas in vitro studies suggested that TF is prebound to ribosomes waiting for polypeptides to emerge from the exit channel, we find that in vivo TF engages ribosomes only after ∼ 100 amino acids are translated. Moreover, excess TF interferes with cotranslational removal of the N-terminal <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine.</b> Our studies support a triaging model in which proper protein biogenesis relies on the fine-tuned, sequential engagement of processing, targeting, and folding factors.

40|$|Peptide Deformylase (PDF) is an {{essential}} metalloenzyme and removes the <b>formyl</b> group from <b>methionine</b> at the N terminus of nascent polypeptide chains. Since this protein is essential for survival {{of most of the}} pathogenic bacteria and functionally equivalent gene is absent in mammalian cells, it provides an attractive target for development of novel antibacterials. In the current project, an In silico approach has been used to develop a novel broad spectrum antibacterial based on binding affinity of PDF with derivatives of hydrazines. Virtual screening and Molecular docking based on Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm was carried out to find binding affinity of PDFs from seven different pathogenic bacteria. These molecules were screened from PubChem database on the basis of structural similarity to sulfonylpiperidine. Molecular Dockings were carried out for each ligand and results were clustered together with accepted RMSD of 0. 5 Ao. Hydrogen bond analysis was done on UCSF Chimera while ADME and toxicity properties were evaluated using Molsoft and PreADMET server. 1 -(4 -fluorophenyl) sulfonylpiperidine- 3 -carbohydrazide (CID_ 4539974) was found to be the best potent inhibitor of PDF, made H-bonds with active metal binding amino residues, successfully passed the Lipinski rule of five, gained good drug-likeness model score, and exhibited negative carcinogenicity and toxicity test. Further, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) was done to check the stability of protein-ligand complex under using GROMACSv 4. 05. Negative system energies of protein-ligand complex, negligible deviation of Cá from crystal structure and decrease in fluctuations in region containing active metal binding amino acid residue supported the stability of protein-ligand complex. The outcomes concluded that CID_ 4539974 have all the desirable properties to become a novel broad spectrum antibacterial by targeting bacterial PDF efficiently that needs further validation by wet lab experiments...|$|R
40|$|TolQ is a 230 -amino-acid protein {{required}} to maintain {{the integrity of the}} bacterial envelope and to facilitate the import of both filamentous bacteriophage and group A colicins. Cellular fractionation experiments showed TolQ to be localized to the cytoplasmic membrane. Bacteria expressing a series of TolQ-beta-galactosidase and TolQ-alkaline phosphatase fusion proteins were analyzed for the appropriate enzyme activity, membrane location, and sensitivity to exogenously added protease. The results are consistent with TolQ being an integral cytoplasmic membrane protein with three membrane-spanning regions. The amino-terminal 19 residues as well as a small loop in the 155 to 170 residue region appear exposed in the periplasm, while the carboxy terminus and a large loop after the first transmembrane region are cytoplasmic. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of TolQ purified from the membrane revealed the presence of the initiating <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine</b> group, suggesting a rapid translocation of the amino-terminal region across the cytoplasmic membrane. Analysis of various tolQ mutant strains suggests that the third transmembrane region as well as parts of the large cytoplasmic loop are necessary for activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemotactic}} {{migration of}} phagocytes to sites of infection, guided by gradients of microbial molecules, {{plays a key}} role in the first line of host defence. Bacteria are distinguished from eukaryotes by initiation of protein synthesis with <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine.</b> Synthetic formylated peptides (FPs) have been shown to be chemotactic for phagocytes, leading to the concept of FPs as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). However, it remains unclear whether FPs are major chemoattractants released by bacteria and whether further chemoattractants are produced. A Staphylococcus aureus mutant whose formyltransferase gene was inactivated (Deltafmt) produced no FPs and the in vitro and in vivo ability of Deltafmt culture supernatants to recruit neutrophils was considerably reduced compared with those of the parental strain. However, some chemotactic activity was retained, indicating that bacteria produce also unknown, non-FP chemoattractants. The activity of these novel PAMPs was sensitive to pertussis toxin but insensitive to the formyl peptide receptor inhibitor CHIPS. Deltafmt culture supernatants caused reduced calcium ion fluxes and reduced CD 11 b upregulation in neutrophils compared with wild-type supernatants. These data demonstrate an important role of FPs in innate immunity against bacterial infections and indicate that host chemotaxis receptors recognize a larger set of bacterial molecules than previously thought. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Mutations in the fmt gene (encoding <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine</b> transferase) that {{eliminate}} formylation of initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA(i)) confer {{resistance to}} the novel antibiotic class of peptide deformylase inhibitors (PDFIs) while concomitantly reducing bacterial fitness. Here we show in Salmonella typhimurium that novel mutations in initiation factor 2 (IF 2) located outside the initiator tRNA binding domain can partly restore fitness of fmt mutants without loss of antibiotic resistance. Analysis of initiation of protein synthesis in vitro showed that with non-formylated Met-tRNA(i) IF 2 mutants initiated much faster than wild-type IF 2, whereas with formylated fMet-tRNA(i) the initiation rates were similar. Moreover, the increase in initiation rates with Met-tRNA(i) conferred by IF 2 mutations in vitro correlated well {{with the increase in}} growth rate conferred by the same mutations in vivo, suggesting that the mutations in IF 2 compensate formylation deficiency by increasing the rate of in vivo initiation with Met-tRNA(i). IF 2 mutants had also a high propensity for erroneous initiation with elongator tRNAs in vitro, which could account for their reduced fitness in vivo in a formylation-proficient strain. More generally, our results suggest that bacterial protein synthesis is mRNA-limited and that compensatory mutations in IF 2 could increase the persistence of PDFI-resistant bacteria in clinical settings...|$|E
40|$|The {{functional}} deficits of neonatal neutrophils are well documented and {{are thought to}} contribute to the increased susceptibility of newborn infants to infection. We measured the adhesion molecules L-selectin, CD 11 a/CD 18 and CD 11 b/CD 18 on neutrophils from the cord blood of term (n = 22) and premature (n = 32) infants using a whole blood method with flow cytometry and quantitative bead standards to enumerate cell surface receptors. We also assayed plasma for the shed form of L-selectin (sL-selectin). Our results suggested that L-selectin expression on term infant neutrophils is lower than that on adult neutrophils (unstimulated and stimulated, both P < 0. 001), but that stimulated premature infant cell express higher L-selectin than term infants (P < 0. 05); it is possible that this deficiency is caused by physiological changes occurring around the normal time of parturition. We observed reduced sL-selectin in term infants (P < 0. 001) compared with adults, and even lower concentrations in premature infants (P < 0. 001). The sL-selectin concentrations in plasma may be a reflection of granulopoiesis, which may be reduced in premature infants. Our results showed increased resting neonatal neutrophil expression of CD 11 b/CD 18 compared with adults, and the absence of any neonatal deficit of the ability to up-regulate CD 11 b/CD 18 expression on stimulation. These findings are contrary to previous reports. Further studies suggested that the isolation procedures used in previous reports reduces the capability of the cells to respond to a <b>formyl</b> <b>methionine</b> leucine phenylalanine (fMLP) stimulus. This effect is more marked in neonatal neutrophils, suggesting that the previously reported deficiency is in fact due to the isolation techniques used rather than the cells' innate ability to up-regulate CD 11 b/CD 18 expression. The results of our study lead us to propose that the adhesive function of neonatal neutrophils may be less defective than previously thought...|$|E
