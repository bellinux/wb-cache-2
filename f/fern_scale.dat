5000|$|The {{breeding}} of some species is entirely undescribed, and {{little is known}} about the breeding in most species. Records of nests have been made in both wet and dry seasons. [...] They build a cup nest, usually on a forked branch near the edge of a tree, out of <b>fern</b> <b>scales</b> and plant fibres bound neatly with insect or spider silk and ornamented with lichens. Little is known about the division of labour in the family, although the pattern exhibited by the black berrypecker, where the female construct the nest alone but both sexes feed the young, may be typical of the family. [...] They lay one or two eggs.|$|R

50|$|Starting in the Carboniferous period, {{a series}} of {{volcanic}} archipelagos formed in the region. Islands in these chains would have hosted warm, wet terrestrial environments. Fossils in Oregon's oldest floral assemblage, dating to the Late Carboniferous period, implies a lagoon ecosystem. Fossils in the assemblage include horsetails, <b>ferns,</b> <b>scale</b> trees, and conifer tree seeds. Formations of similar age also include shallow water invertebrates indicating that Oregon's volcanic islands were surrounded by coral reefs, {{which is consistent with}} Charles Darwin's theory of reef formation.Island chains continued to form over Oregon through the Permian period. Fossil assemblages from that time are therefore similar to those from the Carboniferous, although none have been found that include any Permian plant life. One species of Permian snail found in Oregon, Acteonina permiana, lends credence to the theory of plate tectonics because of its resemblance to contemporary Eurasian species. Fragmentary remains of Permian trilobites, including the endemic species Cummingella oregonensis, have been found in the state's Coyote Butte Formation.|$|R

They have also been recorded inhabiting St. Helena redwood trees.|$|R
50|$|The {{island is}} uninhabited. But {{there are some}} ruins from Genoa era. Most {{important}} ruin is an observation tower. Birds such as sea gull and partridge {{as well as some}} snakes and lizards make up the fauna of the island. Olive, thyme and <b>scale</b> <b>fern</b> are some of the plants.|$|R
50|$|Swamps formed {{across the}} state as the Carboniferous period {{continued}} and the sea left the state. These swamps were full of <b>ferns</b> and <b>scale</b> trees.Xenacanth fossils are known from such deposits. Plant fossils are common from Michigan rocks of Pennsylvanian age. The flora of Michigan back then included club moss trees, ferns, and horsetails. Contemporary vegetation was preserved in the Midland and Saginaw regions. Fossil lungfish burrows are another interesting find from the Pennsylvanian coal swamp deposits near Grand Ledge in Clinton County but these tend to be poorly preserved. Nevertheless, such fossils are an uncommon find. Other Pennsylvanian fish fossils were preserved in Clinton and Saginaw counties of {{the central part of}} the state.|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{detailed}} nesting biology {{information for the}} highland Andean hummingbird Gould's Inca (Coeligena torquata omissa) at 2, 200 - 3, 000 m in Manu National Park, SE Peru. We found nine mossy cup-shaped nests lined with red <b>fern</b> <b>scales</b> containing nestlings or 1 - 2 synchronously hatching eggs. We obtained 17 days of internal nest temperatures from one nest, which exhibited wide circadian variation (range = 14. 9 - 36. 2 °C). We show that C. t. omissa meets the challenges of life and incubation at high altitudes by undertaking numerous (20. 3 ± 0. 4 trips/morning, range = 14 - 27) and short morning off-bouts (5. 2 ± 0. 2 min, range = 1 - 24 min). In the morning, the focal bird warmed the nest 1. 7 times faster than in the afternoon where incubation bouts are long (17. 8 ± 0. 6 min, range = 4 - 56) and less frequent (10. 2 ± 0. 3 trips/afternoon). Incubation off-bout frequency and durations were not influenced by external temperature, suggesting strong nest insulation. On-bout durations increased with external temperature most strongly in the cold mornings. Short off-bouts and long on-bouts yielded high attentiveness (70. 2 %). One nestling fledged after 23 days. The eggs measured 15. 2 ± 0. 4 mm by 9. 3 ± 0. 3 mm and weighed 0. 75 ± 0. 03 g (n = 12). The small mossy cup nest was 81. 9 ± 5. 9 mm by 75. 8 ± 4. 4 mm wide and 73. 1 ± 6. 7 mm high. The inner cup was 45. 7 ± 3. 0 mm long by 45. 6 ± 4. 1 mm wide and 30. 9 ± 2. 5 mm deep (n = 8). Compared to C. t. torquata, we found a smaller egg width, higher nest placement and different nest substrate, but confirmed similarities in many aspects of nesting strategies...|$|R
50|$|Paleontology in Tennessee {{refers to}} paleontological {{research}} occurring within or conducted by {{people from the}} U.S. state of Tennessee. During {{the early part of}} the Paleozoic era, Tennessee was covered by a warm, shallow sea. This sea was home to brachiopods, bryozoans, cephalopods, corals, and trilobites. Tennessee is one of the best sources of Early Devonian fossils in North America. During the mid-to-late Carboniferous, the state became a swampy environment, home to a rich variety of plants including <b>ferns</b> and <b>scale</b> trees. A gap in the local rock record spans from the Permian through the Jurassic. During the Cretaceous, the western part of the state was submerged by seawater. The local waters were home to more fossil gastropods than are known from anywhere else in the world. Mosasaurs and sea turtles also inhabited these waters. On land the state was home to dinosaurs. Western Tennessee was still under the sea during {{the early part of the}} Cenozoic. Terrestrial portions of the state were swampy. Climate cooled until the Ice Age, when the state was home to Camelops, horses, mammoths, mastodons, and giant ground sloths. The local Yuchi people told myths of giant lizard monsters that may have been inspired by fossils either local or encountered elsewhere. In 1920, after local fossils became a subject of formal scientific study, a significant discovery of a variety of Pleistocene creatures was made near Nashville. The Cretaceous bivalve Pterotrigonia thoracica is the Tennessee state fossil.|$|R

50|$|No Precambrian fossils {{are known}} from Kansas, so the state's fossil record {{does not begin}} until the Paleozoic era. Kansas From the Cambrian to the Devonian, Kansas was covered by a shallow sea. The Cambrian life of Kansas left behind few fossils. The state's sea levels began to {{fluctuate}} during the Carboniferous period. While the state was still covered by the sea, it was home to a rich variety of marine invertebrates. During the later half of the Carboniferous, the Pennsylvanian, nautiloids {{could be found in}} Franklin County. Other kinds of marine invertebrates could be found in Anderson County. Paleoniscid fishes swam in the waterways of Douglas County. Some of their fossils have preserved the fishes' soft parts. Fish fossils of this age were also preserved in Anderson County. During the drier intervals Kansas was home to great coastal swamps with a rich flora included <b>ferns</b> and <b>scale</b> trees. These swamps were responsible for leaving behind great coal deposits. The local flora also left behind remains that would later fossilize in what are now southern Labette County and Montgomery County. The plant Walchia grew in Anderson County, although its fossils are rare. The contemporary terrestrial environments of Kansas were home to invertebrates like scorpions. They were also home to amphibians and early reptiles. Such contemporary tetrapods left behind footprints in Kansas that would later fossilize. Among these were tracks of the ichnogenus Limnopus. Other fossils from this time period include Wakarusopus tracks left behind in Douglas County by a colossal amphibian that would have weighed several hundred pounds in life. Pennsylvanian amphibian remains were also preserved in Anderson County. Primitive reptiles left behind remains that were preserved in Anderson County, near the town of Garnett.|$|R

This manuscript version is made available under the CC-BY-NC-ND 4. 0 license [URL] To apply the Masmali tear <b>ferning</b> (TF) grading <b>scale</b> on non-dry eye (NDE) and dry eye (DE) subjects to test {{the validity of the}} grading scale in practice, and to describe the grading scale range for NDE and DE. Method: Forty NDE subjects (20 males, 20 females) and 40 DE subjects (23 males, 17 females) ranging in age from 19 to 53 years (mean ± SD: 25. 3 ± 5. 5) with no other ocular disease, no contact lens wear, and not pregnant or breastfeeding were recruited. McMonnies scores were used for subject grouping. Phenol red thread (PRT) and slit-lamp test were used. A tear sample was collected from right eye, which was then dried to produce a ferning pattern, that was observed using a digital microscope, and graded. Results: Mean McMonnies, PRT and TF grade in NDE subjects were 7. 1 ± 3. 8, 27. 4 ± 4. 3 mm and 0. 78 ± 0. 40, respectively. Median McMonnies, PRT and TF grade in DE subjects were 16. 5 ± 3. 0, 9. 0 ± 2. 0 mm and 2. 3 ± 1. 48, respectively. In NDE subjects, grades 0. 0 – 1. 8 were observed (82. 5 % Grade 0. 0 – 1. 00). Grades 2. 0 – 4. 0 were observed in DE subjects (72. 5 % Grades 2. 0 – 3. 0). For all subjects, there were large correlations between TF grade and PRT (r = − 0. 79), PRT and McMonnies (r = − 0. 60), and TF and McMonnies (r = 0. 73). Conclusions: The Masmali TF grading scale showed good validity in describing the TF patterns. Grades ≥ 2 can be classified as abnormal patterns. The TF test {{has the potential to be}} used in the clinic...|$|R
