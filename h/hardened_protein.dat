25|$|Arthropods (class Athropoda) {{are covered}} with a tough, {{resilient}} integument or exoskeleton of chitin. Generally the exoskeleton will have thickened areas in which the chitin is reinforced or stiffened by materials such as minerals or <b>hardened</b> <b>proteins.</b> This happens {{in parts of the}} body where {{there is a need for}} rigidity or elasticity. Typically the mineral crystals, mainly calcium carbonate, are deposited among the chitin and protein molecules in a process called biomineralization. The crystals and fibres interpenetrate and reinforce each other, the minerals supplying the hardness and resistance to compression, while the chitin supplies the tensile strength. Biomineralization occurs mainly in crustaceans; in insects and Arachnids the main reinforcing materials are various <b>proteins</b> <b>hardened</b> by linking the fibres in processes called sclerotisation and the <b>hardened</b> <b>proteins</b> are called sclerotin.|$|R
5|$|Like all arthropods, chelicerates' {{bodies and}} {{appendages}} {{are covered with}} a tough cuticle made mainly of chitin and chemically <b>hardened</b> <b>proteins.</b> Since this cannot stretch, the animals must molt to grow. In other words, they grow new but still soft cuticles, then cast off the old one {{and wait for the}} new one to harden. Until the new cuticle hardens the animals are defenseless and almost immobilized.|$|R
50|$|When {{mixtures}} of mucilaginous, protein-containing materials together with soluble salts of dichromate {{are exposed to}} ultraviolet light, the protein content becomes tanned and resistant to solution in water. The untanned material can be washed away in warm water leaving a <b>hardened,</b> tanned <b>protein</b> negative.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hardening</b> of the <b>protein</b> {{component}} of insect cuticle {{has been shown}} to be due to the tanning action of an agent produced by oxidation of a phenolic substance. In the analogous hardening of the cockroach ootheca, the phenolic substance concerned is protocatechuic acid.|$|R
40|$|In ectotherms, high {{temperatures}} impose physical limits, impeding activity. Exposure to high heat levels causes various deleterious and lethal effects, including protein misfolding and denaturation. Thermophilic ectotherms have evolved various {{ways to increase}} macromolecular stability and cope with elevated body temperatures; these include the high constitutive expression of molecular chaperones. In this study, we investigated the effect of moderate to severe heat shock (37 - 45 °C) on survival, heat <b>hardening,</b> <b>protein</b> damage and the expression of five heat tolerance-related genes (hsc 70 - 4 h 1, hsc 70 - 4 h 2, hsp 83, hsc 70 - 5 and hsf 1) in two closely related Cataglyphis ants that occur in distinct habitats. Our {{results show that the}} highly thermophilic Sahara ant Cataglyphis bombycina constitutively expresses HSC 70 at higher levels, but has lower induced expression of heat tolerance-related genes in response to heat shock, as compared with the more mesophilic Cataglyphis mauritanica found in the Atlas Mountains. As a result, C. bombycina demonstrates increased protein stability when exposed to acute heat stress but is less disposed to acquiring induced thermotolerance via heat hardening. These results provide further insight into the evolutionary plasticity of the hsp gene expression system and subsequent physiological adaptations in thermophilous desert insects to adapt to harsh environmental conditions.

5|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily {{absent in}} a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly chitin and conchiolin (a <b>protein</b> <b>hardened</b> with calcium carbonate), except the outermost layer in almost all cases is all conchiolin (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of Cobcrephora.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Sporulation, {{characteristic}} {{for some}} bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, {{has not been}} entirely defined yet. Protein phosphatase E (PrpE) and small, acid soluble spore proteins (SASPs) influence this process. Nevertheless, direct result of PrpE interaction on SASPs content in spore coat of B. subtilis has not been evidenced so far. As proteomic approach enables global analysis of occurring proteins, therefore it was chosen in this experiment to compare SASPs occurrence in two strains of B. subtilis, standard 168 and ΔprpE, lacking PrpE phosphatase. Proteomic analysis is still a challenge, and despite of big approach in mass spectrometry (MS) field, the identification reliability remains unsatisfactory. Therefore there is a rising interest in new methods, particularly bioinformatic tools that would <b>harden</b> <b>protein</b> identification. Most of currently applied algorithms are based on MS-data. Information from separation steps is not still in routine usage, even though they also provide valuable facts about analyzed structures. The aim {{of this research was}} to apply a model for peptides retention times prediction, based on quantitative structure-retention relationships (QSRR) in SASPs analysis, obtained from two strains of B. subtilis proteome digests after separation and identification of the peptides by LC-ESI-MS/MS. The QSRR approach was applied as the additional constraint in proteomic research verifying results of MS/MS ion search and confirming the correctness of the peptides identifications along with the indication of the potential false positives and false negatives. Results In both strains of B. subtilis, peptides characteristic for SASPs were found, however their identification confidence varied. According to the MS identity parameter X corr and difference between predicted and experimental retention times (Δt R) four groups could be distinguished: correctly and incorrectly identified, potential false positives and false negatives. The ΔprpE strain was characterized by much higher amount of SASPs peptides than standard 168 and their identification confidence was, mostly for alpha- and beta-type SASP, satisfactory. Conclusions The QSRR-based model for predicting retention times of the peptides, was a useful additional to MS tool, enhancing protein identification. Higher content of SASPs in strain lacking PrpE phosphatase suggests that this enzyme may influence their occurrence in the spores, lowering levels of these proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|High-protein snack bars (protein bars) contain {{high-quality}} protein, sugars {{and other}} {{low molecular weight}} polyhydroxy compounds (PHCs), high-energy confectionary fats, and a minimum of water (water activity ≤ 0. 65). The consequence of the intimate mixing of these components in protein bars {{is that they can}} react together, creating sensory characteristics that are unacceptable to consumers. This study examined the changes occurring in a model protein bar during storage for 50 days at 20 °C. Over this time, fracture stress increased from 20. 1 +/- 1. 8 Pa to 201 +/- 75 Pa at a rate that decreased slightly over time. 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) showed that the molecular mobility of PHCs decreased dramatically over the first 5 days as the batter set into a solid bar. Over the first 17 hours after manufacturing, protein particles became more clustered, and soluble protein appeared to precipitate, as shown by confocal microscopy. Reactive lysine fell 38 % in the first 10 days of storage and was approximately constant thereafter. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed little change in protein molecular weights. Following the initial ‘setting’ phase of 5 - 10 days, fracture stress continued to increase and the molecular mobility of PHCs decreased. Changes in PHC molecular mobility were consistent with glucose crystallisation. Chemical changes were minimal during this phase, which suggests that chemical reactions play little part in the <b>hardening</b> of <b>protein</b> bars and that changes in molecular mobility and changes in microstructure driven by moisture migration may be more important...|$|R
50|$|Cold {{hardening}} {{has also}} been observed in insects such as the fruit fly and diamondback moth. The insects use rapid cold hardening to protect against cold shock during overwintering periods.Overwintering insects stay awake and active through the winter while non-overwintering insects migrate or die. Rapid cold hardening can be experienced during short periods of undesirable temperatures, such as cold shock in environment temperature, {{as well as the}} common cold months. The build up of cryoprotective compounds is the reason that insects can experience cold hardening. Glycerol is a cryoprotective substance found within these insects capable of overwintering. Through testing, glycerol requires interactions with other cell components within the insect in order to decrease the body's permeability to the cold. When an insect is exposed to these cold temperatures, glycerol rapidly accumulates. Glycerol is known as a non-ionic kosmotrope forming powerful hydrogen bonds with water molecules. The hydrogen bonds in the glycerol compound compete with the weaker bonds between the water molecules causing an interruption in the makeup of ice formation. This chemistry found within the glycerol compound and reaction between water has been used as an antifreeze in the past, and can be seen here when concerning cold <b>hardening.</b> <b>Proteins</b> also play a large role in the cryoprotective compounds that increase ability to survive the cold hardening process and environmental change. Glycogen phosphorylase(GlyP) has been a key protein found during testing to increase in comparison to a controlled group not experiencing the cold hardening. Once warmer temperatures are observed the process of acclimation begins, and the increased glycerol along with other cryoprotective compounds and proteins are also reversed. There is a rapid cold hardening capacity found within certain insects that suggests not all insects can survive a long period of overwintering. Non-diapausing insects can sustain brief temperature shocks but often have a limit to which they can handle before the body can no longer produce enough cryoprotective components.Inclusive to the cold hardening process being beneficial for insects survival during cold temperatures, it also helps improve the organisms performance. Rapid cold hardening (RCH) is one of the fastest cold temperature responses recorded. This process allows an insect to instantly adapt to the severe weather change without compromising function. The Drosophila melanogaster (common fruit fly) is a frequently experimented insect involving cold hardening. A proven example of RCH enhancing organisms performance comes from courting and mating within the fruit fly. It has been tested that the fruit fly mated more frequently once RCH has commenced in relation to a controlled insect group not experiencing RCH. Most insects experiencing extended cold periods are observed to modify the membrane lipids within the body. Desaturation of fatty acids are the most commonly seen modification to the membrane. When the fruit fly was observed under the stressful climate the survival rate increased in comparison to the fly prior to cold hardening.In addition to testing on the common fruit fly, Plutella xylostella (diamondback moth) also has been widely studied for its significance in cold hardening. While this insect also shows an increase in glycerol and similar cryoprotective compounds, it also shows an increase in polyols. These compounds are specifically linked to cryoprotective compounds designed to withstand cold hardening. The polyol compound is freeze-susceptible and freeze tolerant. Polyols simply act as a barrier within the insect body by preventing intracellular freezing by restricting the extracellular freezing likely to happen in overwintering periods. During the larvae stage of the diamondback moth, the significance of glycerol was tested again for validity. The lab injected the larvae with added glycerol and in turn proved that glycerol is a major factor in survival rate when cold hardening. The cold tolerance is directly proportional to the build up of glycerol during cold hardening.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Marine mussels anchor to {{a variety}} of {{surfaces}} in turbulent intertidal zones through the use of adhesive plaques formed from <b>hardened</b> mussel adhesive <b>proteins</b> (MAPs). It is believed that 3, 4 -dihydroxyphen-ylalanine (DOPA) imparts both water-resistant adhesive characteristics and rapid curing ability to MAPs. In this paper, DOPA-modified triblock copolymers were synthesized and used to form adhesive hydrogels. Amphiphilic block copolymers with DOPA content as high as 10 wt % were prepared, and aqueous solutions of the polymers rapidly (< 1 min) formed hydrogels by photopolymerization of methacrylate end groups attached to the hydrophobic segments. Contact mechanics adhesion tests were performed on the photocured hydrogels, and it was shown that incorporating DOPA into the polymer structure significantly enhanced work of adhesion to titanium surfaces submerged in an aqueous medium. Work of adhesion values as high as 410 mJ/m 2 were recorded for polymers containing 10 wt % DOPA, although the introduction of Lys {{in the form of a}} DOPA-Lys copolypeptide reduced the work of adhesion. Oxidation of DOPA was shown to reduce work of adhesion to Ti, confirming earlier studies suggesting that the catecholic form of DOPA is largely responsible for adhesion to metal oxide surfaces. The DOPA-containing block copolymers described in this study are candidates for use as adhesive biomaterials for medical applications...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} {{amino acid}} sequence of a low molecular weight peptide from the hemolymph of the housefly Musca domestica L., which had been determined to competitively inhibit phenol oxidase (PO; monophenol, dihydroxy-phenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase; EC 1. 14. 18. 1) in the nM range, was unambiguously established by employing both automatic Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. The physiologically active peptide, which was designated phenol oxidase inhibitor (POI), has an observed molecular weight of 4213. 1 +/- 0. 2 by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The relatively short and structurally dense peptide contained 38 amino acid residues rich in cysteine and lysine. Comparison of the observed and calculated molecular mass indicates that apparently all six cysteine residues form disulfide bridges. Interestingly, sequence analyses of both the intact and protease-digested S-pyridylethylated POI showed {{that one of the}} two tyrosine residues (Tyr- 32) is hydroxylated to a 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (dopa) residue. This agreed with the increase of 16 mass units observed in mass spectrometric measurements. This was further verified by submission of free L-dopa to the sequencer, which gave a retention time consistent with the atypical peak observed at the Edman cycle of the peptide containing dopa. This study demonstrates the existence of a biologically active, dopa-containing peptide among the insects. Since the POI activity was most prominent in aged pupae, especially pharate adults, the POI may {{play an important role in}} smoothing the way of adult emergence through hindering excessive melanization, as well as <b>hardening,</b> of cuticular <b>proteins</b> under the epicuticle...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} matrix-type drug {{delivery}} devices comprising a continuous phase of microporous poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) and a dispersed phase of protein particles (gelatin) with defined size ranges (45 - 90, 90 - 125 and 125 - 250 mm) were produced by rapidly cooling suspensions in dry ice followed by solvent extraction from the <b>hardened</b> material. High <b>protein</b> loadings (38 - 44 %, w/w) were achieved and highly efficient protein release (90 % {{of the initial}} load) was obtained over time periods of 3 - 11 days depending on particle loading and size range. The duration of protein release was extended from 3 to 11 days reducing the protein load. Quantitative analysis of Micro-CT images identified a {{three to four times}} increase in the population of sub- 40 μm pores in those matrices which gave rise to accelerated protein release in 24 h (40 % rising to 80 %) and reduced duration of protein release (11 - 3 days). Formation of a high density of channels and fissures (connects) between the particles is indicated, which facilitate fluid ingress and diffusion of solubilised protein molecules. Micro-CT analysis also confirmed the uniformity of particle distribution in the matrices and provided measurements of macroporosity within 5 - 30 % of the theoretical value for materials displaying irregular shaped macropores larger than 90 μm. These findings demonstrate the utility of Micro-CT for optimising the formulation and performance of matrix-type delivery devices for macromolecular entities. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association...|$|R
