5|$|When Germany invaded Poland on 1 September 1939, Riefenstahl {{was photographed}} in Poland wearing a {{military}} uniform and a pistol on <b>her</b> <b>belt</b> {{in the company}} of German soldiers; she had gone to Poland as a war correspondent. On 12 September, she was in the town of Końskie when 30 civilians were executed in retaliation for an alleged attack on German soldiers. According to her memoir, Riefenstahl tried to intervene but a furious German soldier held her at gunpoint and threatened to shoot her on the spot. She claimed she did not realize the victims were Jews. Closeup photographs of a distraught Riefenstahl survive from that day. Nevertheless, by 5 October 1939, Riefenstahl was back in occupied Poland filming Hitler's victory parade in Warsaw. Afterwards, she left Poland and chose not to make any more Nazi-related movies.|$|E
5|$|Before going {{hunting the}} next day Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain {{whatever}} he catches {{on the condition that}} Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, Lady Bertilak visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted boar for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, this time offering Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take <b>her</b> <b>belt,</b> a girdle of green and gold silk which, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die {{the next day}}, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses – but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.|$|E

She later sighted a convoy of a damaged freighter and two escorts and moved in for an attack only to discover that the freighter was her target of 1 January.

500|$|Hood, {{launched}} in 1918, {{was the last}} World War I battlecruiser to be completed.

Hood was the largest ship in the Royal Navy when completed; thanks to her great displacement, in theory she combined the firepower and armour of a battleship with the speed of a battlecruiser, causing some to refer to her as a fast battleship.

500|$|This {{allowed the}} {{technical}} design process to begin {{and it was}} completed in December 1950. Reviews by the Navy and Shipbuilding Ministries in February 1951 led to some significant changes to the design in April. The original form of the bow {{was similar to that}} of the Chapayev-class light cruisers, but sea trials of the lead ship of that class in December 1950 – January 1951 proved that she was very wet forward, which hindered her seakeeping ability. The Stalingrads bow form was radically altered with a much more raked stem, its sheer and flare were greatly increased and the ship gained almost [...] in length, possibly in response to the Chapayevs problems.

500|$|In 1904, Admiral John [...] "Jacky" [...] Fisher became First Sea Lord, {{the senior}} {{officer of the}} Royal Navy. He had for some time thought about the {{development}} of a new fast armoured ship. He was very fond of the [...] "second-class battleship" [...] , a faster, more lightly armoured battleship. As early as 1901, there is confusion in Fisher's writing about whether he saw the battleship or the cruiser as the model for future developments. This did not stop him from commissioning designs from naval architect W. H. Gard for an armoured cruiser with the heaviest possible armament for use with the fleet. The design Gard submitted was for a ship between , capable of , armed with four 9.2-inch and twelve [...] guns in twin gun turrets and protected with six inches of armour along <b>her</b> <b>belt</b> and 9.2-inch turrets, [...] on her 7.5-inch turrets, 10 inches on her conning tower and up to [...] on her decks.

500|$|HMS Queen Mary {{was similar}} to the s, though she was {{slightly}} larger and given more powerful engines to achieve the same speed as the earlier ships.

As part of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, she unsuccessfully attempted to intercept a German force that bombarded the North Sea coast of England in December 1914. She was refitting during the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915, but participated in the next major fleet action of the war, the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916. Queen Mary hit the German battlecruiser [...] early in the battle and burnt out one of that ship's rear turrets. Seydlitz later knocked out one of Queen Marys main guns.

500|$|The ship's armour {{scheme was}} based on that of the King George V class with a thinner {{waterline}} belt and additional splinter protection. Originally the belt armour was {{equal to that of}} the older ships, but it had to be reduced to offset weight increases when the design was modified to reflect wartime experience. The waterline [...] main belt was composed of Krupp cemented armour (KCA) [...] thick, but increased to [...] abreast the magazines.

500|$|The {{first two}} ships used Harvey armor {{for most of}} their armored {{vertical}} surfaces except for the gun turrets and their support tubes, which were made from Krupp armor.

The belt tapered to a thickness of [...] over the machinery spaces and [...] over the magazines. The belt covered [...] of the ships' length and was [...] high, of which the upper [...] was intended to be above the waterline, but the ships were significantly overweight.

The belt in both ships terminated in 7-inch transverse bulkheads, leaving the ends of the ships unprotected. The transverse bulkheads of the waterline belt in Pobeda were eliminated as the belt was extended {{to the ends of the}} ship with 4-inch armor plates. Above the waterline belt in all three ships was a shorter strake of armor that protected the middle of the ships. It was [...] long and 4 inches thick. The ends of the upper belt were closed off by 4-inch angled transverse bulkheads.|$|E
