50|$|In {{the area}} of leptin, Christos Mantzoros is a world-renowned expert, having pioneered {{physiology}} studies, clinical trials in humans and discovering its therapeutic potential. He {{was the first to}} investigate the normal physiology of leptin in humans, including circadian rhythms and the role of leptin in fasting and with relation to body weight. His team has published the only three studies on leptin pharmacokinetics determining leptin doses to be used in humans. Indeed, his research broadened the understanding of the neuroendocrine function of leptin on body weight, energy homeostasis, gender differentiation, immunology and the interaction with other hormones, such as thyroid stimulating hormone and sex steroids. Observing that hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) and lipodystrophy were conditions of hypoleptinemia, he piloted clinical trials to test the efficacy of leptin to treat these conditions, showing that leptin replacement in patients with HA and lipodystrophy resulted in complete normalization of hormone axes and bone density in HA as well as insulin resistance and metabolic regulation in lipodystrophy. Additionally, he observed that functional changes in how the brain views food occur in subjects with hypoleptinemia and that these can be corrected with leptin replacement. Dr. Mantzoros and his team observed that short-term metreleptin treatment enhanced activity in areas detecting the salience and rewarding value of food during fasting, while long-term treatment decreased attention to and the rewarding value of food after feeding. Furthermore, <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>activity</b> is modulated by metreleptin treatment and leptin decreases functional connectivity of the hypothalamus to key feeding-related areas in these hypoleptinemic subjects. These findings expanded the role of leptin into systemic neuroendocrine regulation.|$|E

We performed studies using human subjects with [high risk (HR) ] and without [low risk (LR) ] a family history of alcoholism to supplement our studies with experimental animals bred selectively for high- or low-ethanol consumption. HR subjects had lower basal plasma /J-endorphin levels as compared with LR subjects, but they had a more pronounced release of /J-endorphin after exposure to ethanol. Findings from animal studies indicated that ethanol-preferring (C 57 BL/ 6) mice (analogous to the HR human subjects) had higher levels of <b>hypothalamic</b> /S-endorphin <b>activity</b> than did ethanol-avoiding (DBA/ 2) mice (analogous to the LR human subjects) under basal conditions.

Thus, although <b>hypothalamic</b> /J-endorphin system <b>activity</b> in human and animal models of alcoholism differs under basal conditions, there is enhanced <b>hypothalamic</b> /J-endorphin system <b>activity</b> after exposure to ethanol in both models.

Twenty-one patients reporting life events associated to the onset of amenorrhea had LH pulse frequency (2. 28 +/- 1. 10 pulses/ 4 hr) lower than those without life events (3. 40 +/- 1. 46 p =. 007).

40|$|Oscillating {{levels of}} adrenal {{glucocorticoid}} hormones {{are essential for}} optimal gene expression, and for maintaining physiological and behavioural responsiveness to stress. The biological basis for these oscillations is not known, but a neuronal "pulse generator" within the hypothalamus has remained a popular hypothesis. We demonstrate that pulsatile <b>hypothalamic</b> <b>activity</b> is not required for generating ultradian glucocorticoid oscillations. We show that a constant level of corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) can activate a dynamic pituitary-adrenal peripheral network to produce ultradian adrenocorticotrophic hormone and glucocorticoid oscillations with a physiological frequency. This oscillatory response to CRH is dose dependent and becomes disrupted for higher levels of CRH. These data suggest that glucocorticoid oscillations result from a sub-hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal system, which functions as a deterministic peripheral hormone oscillator with a characteristic ultradian frequency. This constitutes a novel mechanism by which the level, rather than the pattern, of CRH determines the dynamics of glucocorticoid hormone secretion...|$|E

Despite extensive research devoted to this problem, the main cause of reproductive dysfunction in such patients remains unclear even though DM 1 is known to negatively affect performance of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ghrelin is {{a potent}} orexigenic brain-gut peptide with lipogenic and diabetogenic effects, {{possibly}} mediated by growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHS-R 1 a). Cannabinoids also have orexigenic and lipogenic effects. AMPK is a regulator of energy homeostasis and we have previously shown that ghrelin and cannabinoids stimulate <b>hypothalamic</b> AMPK <b>activity</b> while inhibiting it in the liver and adipose tissue, suggesting that AMPK mediates both the central appetite-inducing and peripheral effects of ghrelin and cannabinoids. AIMS: Using GHS-R KO mice, we investigated whether the known ghrelin receptor GHS-R 1 a {{is required for the}} tissue-specific effects of ghrelin on AMPK activity, and if an intact ghrelin signalling pathway is necessary for the effects of cannabinoids on AMPK activity. METHODS: Wild-type and GHS-R KO mice were treated intraperitoneally with ghrelin 500 ng/g bodyweight or CB 1 agonist HU 210 20 ng/g and hypothalamic, hepatic and adipose AMPK activity was studied using a functional kinase assay. RESULTS: Ghrelin and HU 210 significantly stimulated <b>hypothalamic</b> AMPK <b>activity</b> in wild-type animals (mean±SEM, 122. 5 ± 5. 2 % and 128 ± 11. 6 % of control, p 0. 05).
