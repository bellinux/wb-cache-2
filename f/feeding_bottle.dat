40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{intensive}} care patients, enteral feeding requires sterile feedings because of infectious complications and adequate supplements to meet nutritional needs. Heretofore, prepacked, large-volume formula containers were developed, but bacterial contamination occurred in 4 % to 15 %. Our {{objective was to}} investigate the microbial contamination rate of 1 -L <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> and newly designed administration sets over hanging times of 24 hrs in the {{intensive care}} unit (ICU). DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to the ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients fed via a nasojejunal tube for at least 4 days. MEASUREMENTS: Cultures of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles,</b> administration sets, and gastric and tracheobronchial aspirates at day 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. RESULTS: A total of 4 % of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> and 74 % of infusion sets contained > 10 (2) colony forming units (CFU) /mL. Gastric and bronchial aspirates were positive in 90 % and 92 %, respectively. Bacterial counts of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> were 10 (2) - 10 (5) CFU/mL, and the main bacteria isolated included Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and enterococci. One third of all cultured bacteria in <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles,</b> administration sets, stomach, and lungs belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which was held responsible for the nosocomial infections in the ICU. None of the 1 -L <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> with a hanging time of 19 - 24 hrs was contaminated. Only bottles that had to be exchanged because of need for a faster rate of infusion proved to be contaminated, apparently without clinical consequences. With time and the increasing severity of disease, the administration sets became contaminated at an increasingly faster rate and with higher bacterial counts mainly through retrograde growth of endogenous bacteria. The final step of bottle contamination might have been the bacterial transfer by nurses' hands. CONCLUSION: Despite an almost ideal design of the enteral nutrition delivery system, a 4 % contamination rate of initially sterile feedings with clinically relevant bacteria and the fact that only manipulated systems showed bacterial growth are of concer...|$|R

Samples of the lacteal contents of the <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> were cultured and the medians (25 th and 75 th percentiles) of the counts (bacteria per ml) were significantly higher in the LSE group: mesophilic bacteria, 555, 000 (17, 250 - 4, 350, 000) in the LSE group and 1615 (20 - 500, 000) in the HSE group; coliforms, 2400 (19 - 150, 000) in the LSE group and 7 (0 - 7800) in the HSE group.

40|$|Aim: WHO {{strictly}} recommends breastfeeding of new-borns {{exclusively for}} the first 6 months. This study aims to explore timing and reasons of the mothers who took service from a baby-friendly mother and child health care unit, to start complementary foods. Material and Medhod: For a six week period 358 mothers visiting the baby friendly Mother and Child Health Care Center that was chosen for this descriptive study were interviewed. A structured questionnaire that included open and close ended questions was used. For the babies older than 6 months, the questions about using <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> and pacifiers were asked directing the first 6 months. Data was collected by the same researcher and by face to face interviews. Chi-square, student’s t test, Mann Whitney-U analysis were used. Results: Although % 98, 9 of the mothers were breast feeding after delivery, % 44, 6 started complementary foods before 6 monthsand the most frequent starting period was 0 - 3 months.

Conclusıons: Besides the high frequency of breastfeeding, mothers begin to give solid foods in an early period.
