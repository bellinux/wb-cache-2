We also present an extension of our fixed-view approach to detect entry and <b>exit</b> <b>regions</b> within the entire viewspace of a pan–tilt–zoom camera. We additionally provide methods employing the regions to learn scene occlusions and causal relationships from entry–exit pairs along with exploitation algorithms (e. g., anomaly detection).

The simulations {{showed that the}} histone cores were structurally stable during simulation periods of 100 ns and 50 ns, while DNA was highly flexible at the entry and <b>exit</b> <b>regions</b> and partially dissociated from the histone core. In particular, approximately 20 - 25 bp of DNA at the entry and <b>exit</b> <b>regions</b> of the CENP-A nucleosome exhibited larger fluctuations than DNA at the entry and <b>exit</b> <b>regions</b> of the H 3 nucleosome. Our detailed analysis clarified that this difference in dynamics was attributable to a difference in two basic amino acids in the αN helix; two arginine (Arg) residues in H 3 were substituted by lysine (Lys) residues at the corresponding sites in CENP-A. The difference {{in the ability to}} form hydrogen bonds with DNA of these two residues regulated the flexibility of nucleosomal DNA at the entry and <b>exit</b> <b>regions.</b> Our exonuclease III assay consistently revealed that replacement of these two Arg residues in the H 3 nucleosome by Lys enhanced endonuclease susceptibility, suggesting that the DNA ends of the CENP-A nucleosome are more flexible than those of the H 3 nucleosome. This difference in the dynamics between the two types of nucleosomes may be important for forming higher order structures in different phases...|$|R

50|$|On Monday, November 27, 1978, a {{cold front}} moved through Northwest Louisiana. By Friday, December 1, a {{positively}} tilted trough {{was present in}} the upper atmosphere from the High Plains to the Desert Southwest. This allowed Gulf moisture {{to return to the}} lower part of the atmosphere Friday night. The placement of the upper atmospheric trough allowed very little movement of the associated front from Thursday to Saturday. At this time, the front stretched over north Texas, Southern Missouri, Southwestern Arkansas, and Southeast Oklahoma. This front was unusually strong for the month of December, and placed the Shreveport area under the right <b>exit</b> <b>region</b> of a strong jet stream. The strong synoptic-scale lifting was favorable to thunderstorm formation. Also at this time, a low pressure system had developed over Northeast Texas. This caused increased low-level wind shear that enabled the development of thunderstorms. Meanwhile, a warm temperature plume, or inversion, at the 850-millibar geopotential height allowed low-level instability to increase. CAPE thus soared to 2,179 j/kg on December 2, the evening before the outbreak began.|$|E

40|$|A conceptually new {{approach}} to diagnosing tracer-independent ventilation rates is developed. Tracer Green functions are exploited to partition ventilation rates according to the ventilated fluid’s residence time in the ocean interior and according to where this fluid enters and exits the interior. In the presence of mixing by mesoscale eddies, which are reasonably represented by diffusion, ventilation rates for overlapping entry and <b>exit</b> <b>regions</b> cannot meaningfully be characterized by a single rate. It is a physical consequence of diffusive transport that fluid elements that spend an infinitesimally short time in the interior cause singularly large ventilation rates for overlapping entry and <b>exit</b> <b>regions.</b> Therefore, ventilation must generally be characterized by a ventilation-rate distribution,, partitioned according to {{the time that the}} ventilated fluid spends in the interior between successive surface contacts. An offline forward and adjoint time-averaged OGCM is used to illustrate the rich detail that and the closely related probability density function of residence times provide on the way the ocean communicates with the surface. These diagnostics quantify the relative importance of various surface regions for ventilating the interior ocean by either exposing old water masses to the atmosphere or by forming newly ventilated ones.
