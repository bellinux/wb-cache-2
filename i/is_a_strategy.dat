The boycott was later extended to boycott companies which trade with Israel.|$|E

25|$|Bid shading <b>is</b> placing <b>a</b> bid which <b>is</b> {{below the}} bidder's actual {{value for the}} item.

25|$|The {{ecosystem}} approach <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> for the integrated management of land, water and living resources that promotes conservation and sustainable use in an equitable way. Application of the {{ecosystem approach}} will help to reach a balance of the three objectives of the Convention. An ecosystem approach {{is based on the}} application of appropriate scientific methodologies focused on levels of biological organization, which encompasses the essential structures, processes, functions and interactions among organisms and their environment. It recognizes that humans, with their cultural diversity, are an integral component of many ecosystems.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s and 1990s some {{began to}} see the {{advancing}} theories in ecofeminism as essentialist. Through analysis done by post structural and third wave feminists it was argued that ecofeminism equated women with nature. This dichotomy is dangerous because it groups all women into one category and enforces the very societal norms that feminism is trying to break. Out of this critique rose the anti-essentialist argument. Ecofeminist and author Noel Sturgeon says in an interview that what anti-essentialists are critiquing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> used to mobilize large and diverse groups of both theorists and activists.|$|E
25|$|According to American {{soap opera}} writer and romance novelist Leah Laiman, soap operas are best known and most remembered for romance. The romances in daytime dramas are {{significantly}} characterized by bringing couples together, splitting them up, and starting the cycle over again {{to ensure that}} viewers remain invested in the pairings, if popular. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> that often succeeds within the medium. A supercouple storyline is typically detailed by the couple's facing seemingly insurmountable challenges, such as a difference in social class, strong family interference, simple disagreements, marriages to other people, children with other people, etc.|$|E
50|$|Note that we {{have said}} nothing, as yet, about whether <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> <b>is</b> in any way good. <b>A</b> <b>strategy</b> might direct <b>a</b> player to make aggressively bad moves, and it would still <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy.</b> In fact it is not {{necessary}} even to know the winning condition for a game, to know what strategies exist for the game.|$|R

50|$|Fear, {{uncertainty}} and doubt (often shortened to FUD) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> disinformation <b>strategy</b> used in sales, marketing, public relations, talk radio, politics, religious organizations, and propaganda.

25|$|Delta Air Lines began leasing AirTran Airways' 717 in 2013 and was to {{eventually}} lease all 88 of the airline's fleet, as Southwest Airlines who purchased AirTran wanted {{to preserve its}} all-Boeing 737 fleet rather than taking upon another class of aircraft. In 2015, Blue1 announced it will sell their 717 fleet to Delta Air Lines and Volotea. For Delta, used Boeing 717 and MD-90s allowed them to retire their DC-9s while also being cheaper than buying brand-new Boeing 737 and Airbus A320s. Unlike other mainline US legacy carriers, Delta has decided that its best path to profitability <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> that utilizes older aircraft, and Delta has created a very extensive MRO (maintenance, repair and overhaul) organization, called TechOps, to support them.|$|E
25|$|The closest {{examples}} to a true air invasion are the Battle of Crete, Operation Thursday (the Chindits second operation during the Burma Campaign) and Operation Market Garden. The latter was {{an assault on}} the German-occupied Netherlands conducted in September 1944. Nearly 35,000 men were dropped by parachute and glider into enemy territory in an attempt to capture bridges from the Germans and make way for the Allies' advance. However, even with such a massive force taking the Germans completely by surprise, the assault was a tactical failure and after 9 days of fighting the Allies managed only to escape back to their own lines, having sustained over 18,000 casualties. In the 21st century, as vast improvements are made in anti-aircraft defenses, it seems that the air invasion <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> whose time may never come.|$|E
25|$|In {{synthetic}} {{organic chemistry}} orthogonal protection <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>strategy</b> allowing the deprotection of functional groups independently of each other. In chemistry and biochemistry, an orthogonal interaction occurs {{when there are}} two pairs of substances and each substance can interact with their respective partner, but does not interact with either substance of the other pair. For example, DNA has two orthogonal pairs: cytosine and guanine form a base-pair, and adenine and thymine form another base-pair, but other base-pair combinations are strongly disfavored. As a chemical example, tetrazine reacts with transcyclooctene and azide reacts with cyclooctyne without any cross-reaction, so these are mutually orthogonal reactions, and so, can be performed simultaneously and selectively. Bioorthogonal chemistry refers to chemical reactions occurring inside living systems without reacting with naturally present cellular components. In supramolecular chemistry the notion of orthogonality refers {{to the possibility of}} two or more supramolecular, often non-covalent, interactions being compatible; reversibly forming without interference from the other.|$|E
50|$|As {{with any}} emotion, {{the display of}} anger can be feigned or exaggerated. Studies by Hochschild and Sutton {{have shown that the}} show of anger is likely to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> {{effective}} manipulation <b>strategy</b> in order to change and design attitudes. Anger <b>is</b> <b>a</b> distinct <b>strategy</b> of social influence and its use (i.e. belligerent behaviors) as a goal achievement mechanism proves to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> successful <b>strategy.</b>|$|R
