5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of humans, an {{estimated}} 80% of the land was covered in <b>forest,</b> <b>with</b> only high alpine, wet, infertile and volcanic areas without trees. Massive deforestation occurred after humans arrived, with around half the forest cover lost to fire after Polynesian settlement. Much of the remaining forest fell after European settlement, being logged or cleared {{to make room for}} pastoral farming, leaving forest occupying only 23% of the land.|$|E
5|$|Being highly {{arboreal}} and {{the most}} frugivorous of the lemurs, they thrive only in primary <b>forest</b> <b>with</b> large fruiting trees, where they {{spend most of their}} time in the upper canopy. By spending the majority of their time in the crown of tall forest trees, they are relatively safe from predators such as the fossa.|$|E
5|$|Over the centuries, {{the tree}} grows thicker and taller as {{successive}} rings develop around its trunk and new buds grow on the branches. The tree {{becomes part of}} an old growth <b>forest</b> <b>with</b> a shaded and damp understory of broadleaf trees, shrubs, and ferns. In the canopy, a mat of dead needles and lichen accumulate on the wide upper branches. Exposed to light, air, and rain, the needles decompose and the mat becomes colonized by insects, fungus, and new plants.|$|E

50|$|The wet {{and cool}} older subatlantic (pollen zone IX a) is {{characterized}} in central Europe by an oak forest intruded {{more and more}} by beech (mixed oak <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> lime and elm or mixed oak <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> ash and beech). Humid terrains were generally occupied by alder and ash. The mixed oak forests lasted until the middle subatlantic (pollen zone IX b), which also had a wet but somewhat milder climate. Interspersed within the middle subatlantic are peaks in the occurrence of European beech and European hornbeam (mixed oak <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> beech or mixed oak <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> elm, hornbeam and beech).|$|R

5|$|The {{history of}} the National Forest System is very complicated. Forests have been {{transferred}} between agencies, renamed, divided, consolidated, discontinued, established from parts of existing forests, had portions ceded to other forests, expanded from other lands, among various other actions.

5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense <b>forest</b> <b>with</b> {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, incense cedar, and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} part of the city has a rich tropical evergreen <b>forest</b> <b>with</b> commercially significant trees such as teak, sandalwood, rosewood and bamboo. The soil is predominantly black, which is suitable for cotton cultivation, but some red loamy soil is also found.

40|$|International audienceTrees with {{sufficient}} nutrition {{are known to}} allocate carbon preferentially to aboveground plant parts. Our global study of 49 forests revealed an even more fundamental carbon allocation response to nutrient availability: <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> high-nutrient availability use 58 ± 3 % (mean ± SE; 17 forests) of their photosynthates for plant biomass production (BP), while <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> low-nutrient availability only convert 42 ± 2 % (mean ± SE; 19 forests) of annual photosynthates to biomass. This nutrient effect largely overshadows previously observed differences in carbon allocation patterns among climate zones, forest types and age classes. If <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> low-nutrient availability use 16 ± 4 % less of their photosynthates for plant growth, what are these used for? Current knowledge suggests that lower BP per unit photosynthesis in <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> low- versus <b>forests</b> <b>with</b> high-nutrient availability reflects not merely an increase in plant respiration, but likely results from reduced carbon allocation to unaccounted components of net primary production, particularly root symbionts...|$|R

Talaskangas Nature Reserve, with nearly pristine natural forest and about 50 different wildlife species, is in the Vieremä and Sonkajärvi local area. Logging was planned in the 1980s, but environmental activists prevented exploitation through lobbying. The reserve was formally established in 1994.|$|E

5|$|A rough collie named Lad {{lives at}} the Place with his Master, Mistress, and his mate, Lady. When Knave, a younger collie, is boarded at the Place, Lady begins {{ignoring}} Lad {{in favor of the}} newcomer. During a romp in the <b>forest</b> <b>with</b> Knave, Lady is caught in a leghold trap. Knave leaves her there and returns home but Lad finds her. Several days later, the still limping Lady accidentally gets locked in the library and is subsequently blamed for the destruction of the Master's beloved mounted bald eagle. The Master starts to whip her, but Lad intervenes and takes the whipping himself, knowing Knave was the culprit. Later, he attacks Knave for getting Lady in trouble, sending him fleeing from the Place. As the Master apologizes to Lad, Lady lovingly licks his wounds from the fight.|$|E
5|$|Adams {{is home to}} {{a fairly}} wide variety of animal species. Several hoofed mammals call the {{mountain}} home: mountain goats, Roosevelt elk, black-tailed deer, and mule deer. Large carnivores include cougar, black bear, coyote, bobcat, and the Cascade mountain fox, an endemic subspecies of the red fox. There have also been sightings of wolverine and unconfirmed reports of wolves. Many small mammals also make Adams their home. Squirrels and chipmunks are numerous throughout the forest. Douglas squirrels, least chipmunks, and Townsend's chipmunks live throughout the <b>forest</b> <b>with</b> golden-mantled ground squirrels and California ground squirrels occupying drier areas as well. These squirrels are preyed upon by the elusive and secretive pine martens that also call Adams their home. Hoary marmots and pikas make their home on open rocky areas at any altitude while the elusive snowshoe hare lives throughout the forest.|$|E
5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators {{that live in the}} forest and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present in the <b>forest,</b> <b>with</b> the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E
