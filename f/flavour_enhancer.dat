40|$|The {{study was}} aimed at {{determining}} the effect of <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancers</b> on the occurrence of sensory-specific satiety (SSS) phenomenon in young and elderly people of both sexes. Investigations involved a group of 60 subjects (30 young and 30 elderly ones, 15 {{women and men in}} each group) who rated the pleasantness of instant products with various sensory properties (pasta with Bolognese sauce, lemon gelatin dessert, fruit semolina) before and after ad libitum consumption of pasta with Bolognese sauce without and with the addition of <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancers</b> (sodium monoglutamate, sodium inosinate and a mixture of sodium inosinate and sodium guanylate). A significant effect (p< 0. 001) of age on the development of SSS was demonstrated in the study, yet only in the case of young people. The addition of <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancers</b> to pasta with Bolognese sauce intensified the occur-rence of sensory-specific satiety, however that effect appeared to depend on the sex of the examined and was distinctly higher in women than in men. It was also demonstrated that in the elderly the feeling of satiety occurred at a relatively lower intake of pasta with Bolognese sauce as compared to the young people and the addition of <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancers</b> had no significant effect on the content of energy ingested with a meal in both sex groups...|$|R

50|$|The {{most popular}} use of T. daniellii is as sweetener. The aril {{contains}} a non-toxic, intensely sweet protein named thaumatin, {{which is at}} least 3000 times as sweet as sucrose. In West Africa, the aril is traditionally used for sweetening bread, over-fermented palm-wine and sour food. When the seeds are chewed, for {{up to an hour}} afterwards they cause sour materials eaten or drunk to taste very sweet. Since the mid-1990s, thaumatin is used as sweetener and <b>flavour</b> <b>enhancer</b> by the food and confectionery industry. Substituting synthetic sweeteners, it is used as a non-caloric natural sweetener. Thaumatin is not a carbohydrate thus it is an ideal sweetener for diabetics.|$|E

It is sometimes used to harmonize sweet, sour, salty, and spicy components in food. Asafoetida, onion, and garlic are forbidden in yogic texts, and places them alongside meat and alcohol in terms of producing tamas or lethargy.

Total FAA and essential amino acids were found at significantly higher concentrations in TNB 51 thua nao than in TNMX thua nao (naturally fermented). Both fermented thua nao had much higher concentrations of FAA than had their unfermented counterparts.
