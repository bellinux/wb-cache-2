After positioning herself as queen {{following the death of}} her young husband and second cousin, Radama I, Ranavalona pursued a policy of isolationism and self-sufficiency, reducing economic and political ties with European powers, repelling a French attack on the coastal town of Foulpointe, and taking vigorous measures to eradicate the small but growing Malagasy Christian movement initiated under Radama I by members of the London Missionary Society. She made heavy use of the traditional practice of fanompoana (<b>forced</b> <b>labor</b> as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the realm.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the role of}} the tax and benefit system in spurring the impressive increase in Canadian female labor participation in the last decade. Using annual panel data for 10 large industrial countries over the period 1980 - 2001, I find that reforms in the Canadian tax and benefit system in the mid- 1990 s account for at least one-third of the observed increase in female participation in the period 1995 - 2001. The analysis indicates that policy initiatives similar to the "family-friendly" policies introduced in Canada could boost female participation in other countries and help policymakers meet the challenges of population aging.

40|$|Based on the {{introduction}} of research theories about rural <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer at home and abroad, taking Liaocheng City as the representative of medium and small cities, transfer situation of rural <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> in Liaocheng City is discussed from several aspects, including the transfer of total <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> structure of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> flow of regional <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> industry selection of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> and income of <b>labor</b> <b>force.</b> Combining with the situation of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer in Liaocheng City, social benefits, including both negative and positive benefits, of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer are analyzed. From the aspect of positive benefit, foreign labor is one of premier builders for in-flow area (city), fills in the structural lack of <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> and has made huge contributions to urban construction. Meanwhile, for out-flow area (village), transfer of surplus <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> can reduce the employment pressure in rural areas, increase the income of peasant households, and promote the development of rural economy. From the aspect of negative benefit, {{a large number of}} <b>labor</b> <b>forces</b> pouring into cities will bring pressure on the transportation and infrastructure, increase the instability factor of city, and cause difficulties in the management of city. At the same time, a large number of young <b>labor</b> <b>forces</b> work in cities, leaving only the old and sick in rural areas. This might become a hidden danger to the development of agriculture. Push-Pull Theory is used to analyze the socio-economic factors affecting <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer. Suggestions are put forward to reform the household registration system, to improve the cultural quality of rural <b>labor</b> <b>force,</b> to develop rural secondary and tertiary industries, to promote the rapid and harmonious development of economic society in underdeveloped regions, and to provide scientific reference for the sustainable development of regional economy and the construction of new socialist countryside in Liaocheng City. <b>Labor</b> <b>force</b> transfer, Push-Pull Theory, Liaocheng City, China, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R

The estimations have been performed using Heckman (1979) methodology and results showed relatively small wage elasticities of <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation for both men and women. In contrast, the sensitivity of the <b>labor</b> <b>force</b> participation decision to changes in wages is found to be bigger for females.
