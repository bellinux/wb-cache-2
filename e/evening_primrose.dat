Atamasco lily, periwinkle, buttercup, Jack-in-the-pulpit, maypops, and jewelweed are sometimes {{found on the}} banks and in the shallows of Lake Phelps. The Scuppernong River provides a habitat for swamp dogwood, <b>evening</b> <b>primrose,</b> blue flag iris and cardinal flowers. The roughleaf dogwood is also found near the river. This particular dogwood is rare in North Carolina and the type along the Scuppernong is rarer still.|$|E

Growing among the grasses are flowering species such as <b>evening</b> <b>primrose,</b> mariposa lily, and blue flax, and shrubs such as sagebrush, saltbush, and rabbitbrush. Among {{the wide variety of}} grasses are native perennial bunchgrass, blue grama, sacaton, sideoats grama, bearded sprangletop, and bush muhly. Invasive species that crowd out slower-spreading natives include annual lovegrass and brome (cheat grass).|$|E

25|$|Established in 1980, Antioch Dunes National Wildlife Refuge was {{the first}} {{national}} wildlife refuge in the country established {{for the purpose of}} protecting endangered plants and insects, specifically the Apodemia mormo langei known by the common name Lange's metalmark butterfly, Antioch Dunes <b>evening</b> <b>primrose,</b> and Contra Costa wallflower. It is located on the south shore of the San Joaquin River in Antioch. The refuge and a few acres of surrounding lands contain most of the remaining habitat for these three species and are all that remain of a nine kilometer stretch of sand dunes formed during glaciation periods.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{a column}} in The Guardian {{suggested}} that Horrobin had also actively suppressed research findings contradicting his claims about EPO. Horrobin wrote a meta-analysis of EPO research on eczema in 1989, concluding that EPO was effective. Horrobin excluded the negative results of the largest published study to date but included purported results of seven of his own unpublished studies that remained unpublished as of 2006. When several scientists asked to see the unpublished data, Horrobin's legal team convinced the journal to refuse the request. In 1997, Horrobin's team successfully halted the publication of another meta-analysis commissioned by the Department of Health. Research published after Horrobin's death indicates that fatty acids are no more effective than a placebo against eczema; Scotia's medicines licences for <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> oil drugs was withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|Harris {{has worked}} on Broadway in both musical and {{dramatic}} roles. He played Tobias Ragg in the 2001 concert performances of Sweeney Todd. In 2002, he performed beside Anne Heche in Proof. In 2003, he took {{the role of the}} Emcee in Cabaret alongside Deborah Gibson and Tom Bosley. As a result of his critically acclaimed performance in Cabaret, Harris was named the top-drawing headliner {{in the role of the}} Emcee by GuestStarCasting.com, outranking fellow celebrity stars John Stamos and Alan Cumming. In 2004, he performed the dual role of the Balladeer and Lee Harvey Oswald on Broadway in the musical revival of Stephen Sondheim's Assassins. He also sang the role of Charles (first played by Anthony Perkins) on the Nonesuch recording of Sondheim's <b>Evening</b> <b>Primrose</b> and portrayed Mark Cohen in the 1997 touring company of the musical Rent, a role he satirized on the January 10, 2009, episode of Saturday Night Live, which he hosted.|$|E

Land plants identified in Lake Cahuilla sediments include <b>evening</b> <b>primroses,</b> pine, Polypodiaceae, ragweed, saltbushes, Selaginella sinuites and sunflower. Many of these are represented by pollen. The Pleistocene lake and adjacent lagoons featured charophytes of the genus Chara.|$|R

In an epigynous flower, the stamens, petals, and sepals are {{attached}} to the hypanthium at the top of the ovary or, occasionally, the hypanthium may extend beyond the top of the ovary. Epigynous flowers are often referred to as having an inferior ovary. Plant families with epigynous flowers include orchids, asters, and <b>evening</b> <b>primroses.</b>|$|R
25|$|The 1901 {{mutation}} {{theory of}} evolution held that species went through periods of rapid mutation, possibly {{as a result of}} environmental stress, that could produce multiple mutations, and in some cases completely new species, in a single generation. Its originator was the Dutch botanist Hugo de Vries. De Vries looked for evidence of mutation extensive enough to produce a new species in a single generation and thought he found it with his work breeding the <b>evening</b> <b>primrose</b> of the genus Oenothera, which he started in 1886. The plants that de Vries worked with seemed to be constantly producing new varieties with striking variations in form and color, some of which appeared to be new species because plants of the new generation could only be crossed with one another, not with their parents. DeVries himself allowed a role for natural selection in determining which new species would survive, but some geneticists influenced by his work, including Morgan, felt that natural selection was not necessary at all. De Vries's ideas were influential in the first two decades of the 20th century, as some biologists felt that mutation theory could explain the sudden emergence of new forms in the fossil record; research on Oenothera spread across the world. However, critics including many field naturalists wondered why no other organism seemed to show the same kind of rapid mutation.|$|E

50|$|Circaea is in {{the family}} Onagraceae, which also {{includes}} willowherbs, <b>evening</b> <b>primroses</b> and fuchsias.The genus is named after the enchantress Circe from Greek mythology, {{who is supposed to}} have used enchanter's nightshade in her magic. Enchanter's nightshade is not related to the nightshade family that includes deadly nightshade and the Solanum genus (the Solanaceae). Molecular evidence indicates the closest relative to Circaea is the lineage that gave rise to the genus Fuchsia, which diverged from it around 41 million years ago.|$|R

500|$|Several large {{parks are}} located in Brookings. The [...] Azalea Park in Brookings {{features}} five species of wild azaleas. The park was designated an Oregon State Park in 1939, but was given to Brookings in 1993. It hosts the American Music Festival from June until September. The Nature's Coastal Holiday light show is displayed in Azalea Park every December. Chetco Point Park, located near the wharf, has several fire rings and picnic tables, as well as views of the river, the Pacific Ocean, and the Port of Brookings Harbor.

50|$|Herbaceous weeds, mostly annuals such as asters, <b>evening</b> <b>primroses,</b> {{and milk}} weeds, invade the rock. Their roots {{penetrate}} deep down, secrete acids {{and enhance the}} process of weathering. Leaf litter and death of herbs add humus to the soil. Shading of soil results in decrease in evaporation {{and there is a}} slight increase in temperature. As a result, the xeric conditions begin to change and biennial and perennial herbs and xeric grasses such as Aristida, Festuca, and Poa, begin to inhabit. These climatic conditions favor growth of bacterial and fungal populations, resulting in increase in decomposition activity.|$|R
50|$|Its larvae {{feed upon}} various {{plants in the}} olive family (Oleaceae) such as lilacs (Syringa spp.), ashes (Fraxinus spp.), and privet (Ligustrum vulgare). Mature {{caterpillars}} pupate in subterranean chambers when they have finished feeding, and here the pupae stay dormant until the next year. The moth emerges any time from May to August in the South, but is only found from June to July farther north. Adults feed at dusk on deep-throated flowers and have been sighted at honeysuckles (Lonicera spp.), <b>evening</b> <b>primroses</b> (in the family Onagraceae), dogbane (Apocynum spp.), phlox (Phlox spp.), and bouncing bet (Saponaria officinalis).|$|R
