40|$|The Nevada Test Site (NTS), {{located in}} {{southern}} Nevada, {{has been the}} primary location for testing of nuclear explosives in the continental US. Testing began in 1951 and continued until the moratorium in 1992. Waste storage and disposal facilities for defense radioactive and mixed waste are located in Areas 3 and 5. At the Area 5 Radioactive Waste Management Site (RWMS- 5), low-level wastes (LLW) from US Department of <b>Energy</b> (DOE) <b>affiliated</b> onsite and offsite generators are disposed of using standard shallow land disposal techniques. Transuranic wastes are retrievably stored at the RWMS- 5 in containers on a surface pad, pending shipment to the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant facility in New Mexico. Nonradioactive hazardous wastes are accumulated at a special site before shipment to a licensed offsite disposal facility. Non-standard packages of LLW are buried in subsidence craters in the Area 3 RWMS. This report describes these activities on and around the NTS and includes a listing of the results obtained from environmental surveillance activities during the second calendar quarter of 1996...|$|R
30|$|The {{ocean energy}} {{development}} in China {{is still at}} its initial stage. Some research institutes and companies are making great efforts to develop marine resources. In 2002, Harbin Engineering University independently designed and constructed the first 70  kW tidal current energy testing power station in China, and completed building a 40  kW tidal current testing power station named ‘Universal II’, which is categorized as submarine stationary vertical axis tidal current device. Northeast Normal University completed building a 1  kW underwater suspended horizontal axis tidal current device in 2008. Ocean University of China and China Academy of Machinery Science and Technology jointly developed a 5  kW tidal current energy generation device equipped with hydraulic turbine featured with flexible blades which passed tests in real sea in Qingdao in 2008. Zhejiang University developed a 5  kW and a 25  kW stationary horizontal axis tidal current device successively which both passed power generation tests in real sea. Until now, a 100 kW power station with oscillating water column (OWC) structure has been constructed in Shanwei City of Guangdong Province and a 30 kW pendulum wave energy testing power station in Daguang island of Qingdao. Guangzhou Institute of <b>Energy</b> Conversion <b>affiliated</b> with Chinese Academy of Science developed a 3  kW, a 20  kW and a 100  kW land-based wave power testing station successively.|$|R
40|$|The Florida Solar <b>Energy</b> Center (FSEC), <b>affiliated</b> {{with the}} University of Central Florida, has invented a {{reversible}} pigment that changes from light beige to blue {{when exposed to}} hydrogen and back to light beige when exposed to atmospheric oxygen. In laboratory and environmental studies, the FSEC pigment in its tape form failed to change color adequately when exposed to hydrogen after one day of exposure at Kennedy Space Center's Beach Corrosion Test Facility. The reversible hydrogen-detecting tape also lost its ability to change color after being placed in an environmental chamber at 45 C for one day. The first attempts at extruding the reversible pigment into various polymers were unsuccessful because of the pigment's poor thermal stability. The goal of this project was to formulate a pigment with improved thermal and environmental stability for extrusion {{into a variety of}} appropriate polymer matrices. The formulation of the reversible hydrogen-detecting pigment was modified by removing one reagent and chemically modifying the hydrogen sensitive ingredient. This was intended to improve the hydrophobicity of the pigment and alter the thermal degradation mechanism...|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Google Energy {{made its}} first {{investment}} in a renewable energy project, putting $38.8 million into two wind farms in North Dakota. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5 megawatts of power, enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by NextEra Energy Resources, will reduce fossil fuel use {{in the region and}} return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty-percent stake in the project to get funding for its development. In February 2010, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FERC granted Google an authorization to buy and sell energy at market rates. The order specifically states that Google Energy—a subsidiary of Google—holds the rights [...] "for the sale of energy, capacity, and ancillary services at market-based rates", but acknowledges that neither Google <b>Energy</b> nor its <b>affiliates</b> [...] "own or control any generation or transmission" [...] facilities.

40|$|Within {{the past}} decade, the Space Solar Power (SSP) {{community}} has seen {{an influx of}} stakeholders willing to entertain the SSP prospect of potentially boundless, base-load solar <b>energy.</b> Interested parties <b>affiliated</b> with the Department of Defense (DoD), the private sector, and various international entities have all agreed that while the benefits of SSP are tremendous and potentially profitable, the risk associated with developing an efficient end to end SSP harvesting system is still very high. In {{an effort to reduce}} the implementation risk for future SSP architectures, this study proposes a system level design that is both low-cost and seeks to demonstrate the furthest transmission of wireless power to date. The overall concept is presented and each subsystem is explained in detail with best estimates of current implementable technologies. Basic cost models were constructed based on input from JPL subject matter experts and assume that the technology demonstration would be carried out by a federally funded entity. The main thrust of the architecture is to demonstrate that a usable amount of solar power can be safely and reliably transmitted from space to the Earth's surface; however, maximum power scalability limits and their cost implications are discussed...|$|R
