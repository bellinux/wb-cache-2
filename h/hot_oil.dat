5|$|Deep frying is {{done with}} a deep fryer, a pan such as a wok or chip pan, a Dutch oven, or a {{cast-iron}} pot. Additional tools include fry baskets, which are used to contain foods in a deep fryer and to strain foods when removed from the oil, and cooking thermometers, used to gauge oil temperature. Tongs, slotted spoons, wooden spoons, and sieves {{may be used to}} remove or separate foods from the <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b>|$|E
30|$|If the {{paraffin}} {{problems are}} extensive and require frequent mechanical removal operations, this procedure may become costly. Additionally, for isolated wells, the minimum charges {{can also be}} expensive. Generally, this procedure is used when <b>hot</b> <b>oiling</b> cannot be used (Khandekar 2015). However, mechanical removal is not so efficient as <b>hot</b> <b>oiling,</b> being about 67 % effective (Khandekar 2015).|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} common oil-field {{treatments}} is <b>hot</b> <b>oiling</b> to remove paraffin from wells. Even though the practice is common, the thermal effectiveness of the process is not commonly understood. In order for producers to easily understand the thermodynamics of <b>hot</b> <b>oiling,</b> a simple tool is needed for estimating downhole temperatures. Such a tool has been developed that was distributed as a compiled, public-domain-software spreadsheet. That spreadsheet has evolved into a interactive from on the World Wide Web ([URL] and has been adapted into a Windows program by Petrolite, St. Louis MO. The development of such a tools was facilitated by expressing downhole temperatures in terms of analytic formulas. Considerable algebraic work is required to develop such formulas. Also, the data describing <b>hot</b> <b>oiling</b> is customarily a mixture of practical units that must be converted to a consistent set of units. To facilitate the algebraic manipulations and to assure unit conversions [...] ...|$|R

5|$|In India carrots {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} ways, as salads or as {{vegetables}} added to spicy rice or dal dishes. A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> Carrots can also be cut in thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Department {{responded by}} sending {{personnel}} {{to analyze the}} proposed route and plan. Max Brewer, an arctic expert {{in charge of the}} Naval Arctic Research Laboratory at Barrow, concluded that the plan to bury most of the pipeline was completely unfeasible because of the abundance of permafrost along the route. In a report, Brewer said the <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> conveyed by the pipeline would melt the underlying permafrost, causing the pipeline to fail as its support turned to mud. This report was passed along to the appropriate committees of the U.S. House and Senate, which had to approve the right-of-way proposal because it asked for more land than authorized in the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 and because it would break a development freeze imposed in 1966 by former Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall.|$|E
5|$|Trough systems {{convert the}} heat from the sun into electricity. Because of their {{parabolic}} shape, trough collectors can focus the sun at 30-60 times its normal intensity on a receiver pipe located along the focal line of the trough. Synthetic oil circulates through the pipe and captures this heat, reaching temperatures of 390°C (735°F). The <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> is pumped to a generating station and routed through a heat exchanger to produce steam. Finally, electricity is produced in a conventional steam turbine. The SEGS plants operate on natural gas on cloudy days or after dark, and natural gas provides 25% of the total output.|$|E
30|$|None {{of these}} {{measures}} is seen {{to be effective in}} the long term to prevent wax deposition in the field cases. For instance, Straub et al. denoted that <b>hot</b> <b>oiling</b> treatments performed did not produce permanent advantages (Straub et al. 1989).|$|R
30|$|The {{concept of}} using hot {{watering}} is like <b>hot</b> <b>oiling,</b> and {{this method is}} used {{as an alternative to}} it. Water contains a higher heat capacity than the oil, for the same temperature, making it an interesting solution and cost effective. The other advantage of hot water is that water does not contain contaminants that may be present in oil (Khandekar 2015). However, hot water cannot provide the solvency available in <b>hot</b> <b>oiling.</b> Furthermore, surfactants need to be added to help the dispersion of wax into the water phase. To be effective, the surfactant needs to be in contact with melted paraffin, otherwise the mixture of water and surfactant will produce very large water-wet particles of wax. To demulsify the water-wet waxes solution, greater amounts of demulsifier needs to be used than usually used in the two-phase water and oil.|$|R

The oils used were also extracted from sesame and olives. Essential oil was produced by joining various retorts, the steam from these retorts condensed, combined and its scented droplets were used as perfume and mixed to produce the most costly medicines.|$|R
25|$|Adiabatic storage {{continues}} {{to keep the}} heat produced by compression and returns it to the air as it is expanded to generate power. This is a subject of ongoing study, with no utility scale plants as of 2015, but a German project ADELE is planning to bring a demonstration plant (360MWh storage capacity) into service in 2016. The theoretical efficiency of adiabatic storage approaches 100% with perfect insulation, but in practice round trip efficiency {{is expected to be}} 70%.

25|$|CSS {{has been}} in use by Imperial Oil at Cold Lake since 1985 and is also used by Canadian Natural Resources at Primrose and Wolf Lake and by Shell Canada at Peace River. In this method, the well is put through cycles of steam injection, soak, and oil production. First, steam is {{injected}} into a well at a temperature of 300 to 340 degrees Celsius {{for a period of}} weeks to months; then, the well is allowed to sit for days to weeks to allow heat to soak into the formation; and, later, the <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> is pumped out of the well for a period of weeks or months. Once the production rate falls off, the well is put through another cycle of injection, soak and production. This process is repeated until the cost of injecting steam becomes higher than the money made from producing oil.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacture}} of the chains involved several processes: The {{figure of eight}} links were punched from a sheet of steel and assembled three deep with the centre link overlapping the two outer, like a bicycle chain. The links were held together with rivets cut from steel wire and hooks punched from sheet metal were attached to either end. The entire chain was filed smooth, burnished and tempered in <b>hot</b> <b>oil.</b> Because the work was so fine, the chains were often thinner than a piece of cotton thread, a magnifying instrument was required. In addition it was common practice to place a glass globe filled with water {{in front of a}} candle and a mirror behind to increase the light. By 1793 Robert Cox had a monopoly on chain production in Britain, supplying watch, clock and chronometer makers throughout the country. Production flourished and in 1845 William Hart opened a similar factory in Bargates. It was built to an advanced design with particularly large windows on either side. 74' long but only 18' wide, it allowed the maximum amount of natural light to enter.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire {{was also}} {{developing}} their own artillery pieces. Mehmed the Conqueror (1432-1481) was determined to procure large cannons {{for the purpose of}} conquering Constantinople and paid handsomely as well as allowed creative autonomy for cannon makers. One of the cannon makers that responded to his call was a Hungarian named Urban, who left Byzantium after being denied a raise by the Byzantine emperor. Urban labored for four months to create a six meter long cannon, which required hundreds of pounds of gunpowder to fire, and its stone projectiles weighed between 550 and 800 kilograms. The gun's projectiles were reported to have flown for a mile before landing, and shook the entire ground when fired, the roar blasting four miles away. It had to be transported by 30 wagons pulled by 60 oxen, with the assistance of 200 handlers. An additional 50 carpenters and 200 laborers helped in the transport by leveling terrain and building bridges. During the actual siege of Constantinople the gun proved to be somewhat underwhelming. The aiming process was laborious and after each shot it required <b>hot</b> <b>oil</b> ointment for cooling. Its rate of fire was once every three hours, and may have even suffered damage from cracks early on, never to be repaired.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>oil</b> was {{considerably}} less common than boiling water or heated sand, which were cheap and extremely effective; even [...] "dust from the street" [...] could be used. These would penetrate armour and cause terrible burns. Sand, especially, could {{work its way}} through very small gaps in armour. [...] The Phoenicians at the Siege of Tyre (332 BC) dropped burning sand down on the attacking Greeks, which got in behind the armour and burned the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Spilled <b>hot</b> cooking <b>oil</b> {{can also}} cause severe third degree burns, In the {{worst-case}} scenario, severe burns can be fatal. The higher temperatures and tendency of oil {{to stick to the}} skin make spilled <b>hot</b> cooking <b>oil</b> far more dangerous than spilled hot water. Children can accidentally place their hands on top of the stove, playing with the materials while being cooked, or accidentally pull the pot down, which can cause significant injury. The utmost care should be used when deep frying when children are present, to protect their safety at all times.|$|R
