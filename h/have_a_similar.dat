5|$|Collybia cirrhata is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the remaining members of Collybia, which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> external appearance. C.tuberosa is distinguished by its dark reddish-brown sclerotia that resemble apple seeds, while C.cookei has wrinkled, often irregularly shaped sclerotia that are pale yellow to orange. Other similar mushrooms include Baeospora myosura and species of Strobilurus, but these species only grow on pine cones.|$|E
5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear to {{have a significant impact on}} long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{prepared}} with toppings such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazes, dusted with granulated sugar or cinnamon-sugar, or served plain without any topping. The {{shape of the}} doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> texture {{to that of a}} buttermilk doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.|$|E

5|$|Modern digital {{typography}} {{has reduced the}} costs of typesetting substantially, especially for small print runs. As long as a freely licensed Deseret alphabet font and a font of the standard orthography have similar inked surface areas, printing a book in the Deseret alphabet using modern technology would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> cost as printing a book in the standard orthography.|$|E
5|$|Namaka is only 1.5% {{as bright}} as its parent dwarf planet Haumea and is about 0.05% its mass. If {{it turns out to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> albedo, it would be about 170km in diameter. Photometric {{observations}} indicate that its surface is made of water ice.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to develop}} a new stadium and {{training}} facilities near Westhill, close to the newly developed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, were announced in May 2016. The site's training facilities are scheduled to be operational by 2018, while the stadium could be ready ahead of the 2019–20 season. The new stadium is expected to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> capacity to Pittodrie Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Some {{animals are}} {{coloured}} purely incidentally because their blood contains pigments. For example, amphibians like the olm {{that live in}} caves may be largely colourless as colour has no function in that environment, but they show some red because of the haem pigment in their red blood cells, needed to carry oxygen. They also have a little orange coloured riboflavin in their skin. Human albinos and people with fair skin <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> colour for the same reason.|$|E
5|$|Species of Crepidotus {{having a}} similar shape can be {{distinguished}} by their brown spore print, compared with the white spore print of P.stipticus. Schizophyllum commune has a densely hairy white to grayish cap and longitudinally split gill-folds on the underside. The ruddy panus mushroom (Panus rudis) is larger, has a reddish-brown cap that fades to pinkish-tan, and shows lilac tinges when young, fresh, and moist. Some Paxillus species may <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> appearance, but they have yellow-brown spore prints.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there are}} many Cortinarius species {{with some degree of}} violet colour, C.violaceus and its close {{relatives}} are easily distinguished by their much darker purple colour. Cortinarius iodes of the southeastern United States has a slimy purple cap and paler violet stipe. The other species in the section Cortinarius are dark purple and superficially similar, but can be differentiated based on host and geography as they do not occur in the same locations as C. violaceus. Certain Leptonia species in northwestern North America, including L. carnea and L. nigroviolacea, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> color, but are easily differentiated due to their pink spore print.|$|E

5|$|Blandy ordered Warren {{to explain}} his {{position}} to 1,400 skeptical officers and sailors. Some found him persuasive, but it was August 9 before he convinced Blandy. That was the date when Blandy realized, for the first time, that Geiger counters could not detect plutonium. Blandy {{was aware of the}} health problems of radium dial painters who ingested microscopic amounts of radium in the 1920s, and the fact that plutonium was assumed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> biological effect. When plutonium was discovered in the captain's quarters of Prinz Eugen, unaccompanied by fission products, Blandy realized that plutonium could be anywhere.|$|E
5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the wood turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the wood turtle shares with only the bog turtle. It and the bog turtle <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> genetic makeup, which is marginally {{different from that of the}} spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. The wood turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the wood turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of Rasanayagam Mudaliar and Swami Gnanapragasar the Aryacakravarti dynasty was {{connected}} to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. Rasanayagam believes that a Brahmin from the town of Rameswaram married into the surviving family members of the Kalinga Magha, an invader claiming to be from Kalinga kingdom in India. Magha apparently belonged to the Eastern Ganga Dynasty. The Royal flag of the Jaffna kingdom is similar to the Royal insignia of the Eastern Gangas. Gangas themselves also claimed Brahmin origins. The Setu coins minted by the Aryacakravarti kings also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> symbol.|$|E

5|$|Malta's fortifications are {{featured}} {{a number of}} times on the islands' heraldry. The coat of arms of Malta contains a mural crown in gold with a sally port and eight turrets (five of which are visible), which represents the fortifications as well as Malta's status as a city-state. The coats of arms of the five regions of Malta <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> crown but with five turrets, all of which are visible. A mural crown with four visible turrets can be seen on the coats of arms of Valletta, Mdina and Birgu, indicating their status as capital city or former capitals. Another version with four turrets (three visible) can be seen on the coats of arms of Cospicua, Senglea, Qormi, Siġġiewi, Żabbar, Żebbuġ, Żejtun and Victoria, indicating the status of a city.|$|E
5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independently—the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E
5|$|Muslims {{are obliged}} to follow the {{decisions}} of Syariah courts in matters concerning their religion. The Islamic judges are expected to follow the Shafi'i legal school of Islam, which is the main madh'hab of Malaysia. The jurisdiction of Syariah courts is limited to Muslims in matters such as marriage, inheritance, divorce, apostasy, religious conversion, and custody among others. No other criminal or civil offences are {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Shariah courts, which <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>similar</b> hierarchy to the Civil Courts. Despite being the supreme courts of the land, the Civil Courts do not hear matters related to Islamic practices.|$|E
