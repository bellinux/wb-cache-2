50|$|In Kentucky, <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> {{makes up}} an {{estimated}} 0.7% of total employment, and {{the agricultural sector}} accounts for about 2% of Kentucky's GDP. Agriculture {{as a percentage of}} the state's GDP has declined over time; in 1963 agriculture accounted for an estimated 5% of the state's GDP. In 2007, the state had 85,260 farms; by 2012, this number had declined to 77,064. In 2013, the average market value of agricultural products per farm in Kentucky was $65,755.|$|E
50|$|Agriculture {{and rural}} {{development}} {{was a high}} priority theme with IEG since in inception. The projects under this theme are funder by the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India. The efforts are focussed on sustainable agricultural development with special attention on environmental economics. The studies revolve around the pattern of growth in agriculture, its sources, determinants and implications in the society and the non <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> in rural and urban India. The researches have produced several books, journals and research papers which are available for reference with IEG library.|$|E
50|$|Katemcy became {{attractive}} to settlers with its inexpensive acreage and bountiful water supply. The area received its first telephone in 1914. Local farms were often tenant farms, {{an arrangement that}} contributed to the thriving rural community that supported three churches, a school, two doctors, two general stores, two blacksmith shops, and a cotton gin. By 1920, the tractor had replaced a lot of field hands, and <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> began to disappear. The population began its decline in 1925. The Katemcy school system was consolidated with Mason in 1945. Today, the rural community population remains small.|$|E
50|$|The farm’s rich {{soil and}} high water table, {{as well as}} the region’s ideal climate, make it a solid {{foundation}} for a future Agricultural program.

50|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century, Fanad, in common with other coastal areas of Donegal, settled into a pattern of {{subsistence}} <b>farming.</b> <b>Employment</b> outside of agriculture was very limited, leading to continuing high levels of migration both permanent and seasonal, some overseas to the UK and to the US, and some to cities in Ireland including Derry and to a lesser extent, Belfast and Dublin. The drop in population continued, with the population recorded as 2,846 in 1961 approximately a quarter of that recorded in the 1840s.|$|R
50|$|Spain's {{economic}} {{transformation in the}} 1960s {{and in the first}} half of the 1970s caused tremendous outmigration from rural areas. Between 1960 and 1973, 1.8 million people migrated to urban areas. Even later, between 1976 and 1985, when the economy was experiencing serious difficulties, the fall in <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> averaged 4 percent per annum. The results of these migrations were reflected in the changing percentage of the population involved in farming. In 1960, 42 percent of the population was engaged in agricultural work. By 1986 about 15 percent was so employed — a marked reduction, though still twice as high as the European Community (EC) average.|$|E
50|$|Under the program, total <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> skyrocketed, {{domestic}} {{farm worker}} employment decreased, and the farm wage rate decreased. Critics have noted widespread {{abuses of the}} program: workers had ten percent of their wages withheld for planned pensions but the money was often never repaid. Workers also were de-loused with DDT at border stations and were often placed in housing conditions deemed ‘highly inadequate’ by the Farm Service Agency. Other scholars who interviewed workers have highlighted {{some of the more}} positive aspects of the program, including the higher potential wages a bracero could earn in the United States. Due {{in large part to the}} growing opposition by organized labor and welfare groups, the program came to an end in 1964.|$|E
5000|$|After 1950, Germany overtook Britain in {{comparative}} productivity levels {{for the whole}} economy, primarily {{as a result of}} trends in services rather than trends in industry. The Marshall Plan was eagerly adopted in Germany as a way to modernize business procedures and utilize the best practices, while these changes were resisted in Britain. [...] Britain's historic lead in productivity of its services sector was based on external economies of scale in a highly urbanized economy with an international orientation. On the other hand, the low productivity in Germany was caused by the underdevelopment of services generally, especially in rural areas that comprised a much larger sector. As German <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> declined sharply after 1950 thanks to mechanization, catching-up occurred in services. This process was aided by a sharp increase in human and physical capital accumulation, a pro-growth government policy, and the effective utilization of the education sector to create a more productive work force.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to inquire into the {{problems}} of psrt-time farmers in Hokkaido. 1. Part-time farmers in Hokkaido are different from their prefectural counterparts in four ways. 2. The development since 1970 of part-time farming in the main rice field region in Hokkaido, Ishikari, has been different in each basin. Part-time farmers can be classified into three types according to the size of operational holding. 3. Part-time <b>farming</b> <b>employment</b> in Hokkaido is limited, as it is a form of decreasing the coata of labor. As opportunities for work have decreased, it has become necessary for Hokkaido to promote its own part-time farming...|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{low income}} {{elasticity}} of demand for farm products {{and the ability of}} farmers to increase labor productivity, economic growth requires that <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> decline if farmers are to share in the benefits of such growth. In 1952 approximately 84 percent of China's workers were engaged in agriculture; in 1997 the figure had declined to 41 percent. By 2030 <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> may account for only 10 percent of the total. The productivity of farm labor must increase at a rapid pace if the 63 percent decline in <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> does not adversely affect the rate of growth of farm output.

S. households in 1980. However, in 1990, the farm employment-poverty relationship reversed: an additional farm job was associated with an increase in poverty.

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the possible}} impacts of CAP reform on <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> in an economically disadvantaged rural region in Hungary using survey among farmers. Results show that farmers are rather {{pessimistic about the}} employment effects of CAP reformy expecting {{a decrease in the}} number of farm jobs regardless of the type. Econometric analyses suggest that farm size in terms of area is positively related to the expected number of male employment on the farms, whilst the less favoured land has negative effects on the male employment except seasonal workers. Farms employing more labour expect thet number of full time female workers to slightly increase, whilst the number of part-time and seasonal employees is expected to decrease. Less favoured areas have negative impact on the job expectancy for seasonal workers. In general, farmers’ expectations contradict to the intention of CAP reform.

40|$|During {{recent decades}} rural areas in Croatia {{underwent}} fundamental change. In {{most of them}} depopulation was rife and {{the participation of the}} agricultural population decreased greatly, there was a diversification of non-agrarian activities and urban patterns of life spread through rural areas. However, changes in rural areas differ and vary from one part of Croatia to the other. This article treats social and demographic change in the commune of Imotski, with reference to economic factors. Meager conditions of life and an inclination towards mobility had a strong influence in the Imotski area, resulting in migration towards cities and abroad. The result was that the population relied on three existential foundations: small <b>farms,</b> <b>employment</b> in local non-agricultural activities and work abroad.

40|$|There is {{a general}} {{consensus}} that bad economic policies, among other factors, {{are to blame for}} the poor performance of economies in sub Saharan African (SSA). However, there is no similar consensus on the effect of economic reforms on poverty alleviation, a primary goal of any economy in the region. This paper looked into the effect of macro-economic reforms, particularly the removal of subsidized agricultural credit for irrigator farmers in Ghana, a pioneering reform country in SSA. A theoretical model of this scenario is constructed in which it is shown that, under multiple market imperfection, farmers resort to alternative financial sources to finance irrigation. Particularly in the presence of off- farm alternative, farmers divide their labor resource between irrigation farming and off- <b>farm</b> <b>employment.</b> The long term implication of a predominant dependence on off-farm income for financing irrigation farming will be an induced increase in family size. This model is subsequently tested and validated with a household data collected from northern Ghana. Household labor endowment and off-farm participation have a positive and significant effect on household irrigation decisions. This implies that, irrigation and off- <b>farm</b> <b>employment</b> are complimentary activities, which indicates a possible induced family size increase. 2 I...|$|E
