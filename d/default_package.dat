5000|$|... #Caption: GNOME Software, Fedora's <b>default</b> <b>package</b> manager {{front-end}} ...|$|E
5000|$|PackageKit is {{included}} as a front-end to yum, and as the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> manager.|$|E
50|$|CouchDB {{includes}} {{a number of}} other open source projects as part of its <b>default</b> <b>package.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>default</b> <b>packages</b> include Nautilus Elementary, Adobe Flash, the Fluendo MP3 Codec, VLC, Infinality Freetype, LibreOffice, and the nano editor.|$|R
50|$|Wakanda {{supports}} {{some of the}} Node.js modules including EventEmitter, Socket, and TLS. Wakanda includes other {{open source}} projects {{as part of its}} <b>default</b> <b>packages.</b> Wakanda Server is built with JavaScriptCore, ICU, OpenSSL and Zlib.|$|R
50|$|Precompiled (binary) ports {{are called}} packages. A package {{can be created}} from the {{corresponding}} port with the make package command; prebuilt packages are also available for download from FreeBSD-hosted package repositories. A user can install a package by passing the package name to the pkg install command. This downloads the appropriate package for the installed FreeBSD release version, then installs the application, including any software dependencies it may have. By <b>default,</b> <b>packages</b> are downloaded from the main FreeBSD Package Repository (pkg.freebsd.org).|$|R
50|$|DNF {{has been}} the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> manager for Fedora since version 22 which was {{released}} in May 2015. The libdnf library {{is used as a}} package backend in PackageKit.|$|E
50|$|WANdisco {{provides}} Subversion binary downloads for Windows, Debian, CentOS, Solaris, Ubuntu, Mac OS X and RHEL via its website. These binaries use the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> {{management system}} for each Linux distribution.|$|E
5000|$|While the Oak default {{access level}} {{was the same}} as Java's (<b>default)</b> <b>package</b> private access level, it was called [...] "private". Oak did not have an {{equivalent}} to Java's [...] access modifier.|$|E
5000|$|By <b>default,</b> Maven <b>packages</b> the POM file in {{generated}} JAR and WAR files. Tools like diet4j can {{use this}} information to recursively resolve and run Maven modules at run-time without requiring an [...] "uber"-jar that contains all project code.|$|R
50|$|An east-facing {{photo of}} the Seven Sisters is {{included}} {{as one of the}} <b>default</b> landscape wallpapers <b>packaged</b> with Microsoft Windows 7.|$|R
5000|$|DistroWatch {{concluded}} [...] "Xubuntu {{is a great}} distribution, but its <b>default</b> {{selection of}} <b>packages</b> does not necessarily suit itself to low-memory systems." ...|$|R
50|$|DESQview/X {{had three}} window {{managers}} that it launched with, X/Motif, OPEN LOOK, and twm. The <b>default</b> <b>package</b> contained only twm, {{the others were}} costly optional extras, as was the ability to interact on TCP/IP networks. Mosaic was ported to DVX.|$|E
50|$|DNF or Dandified Yum is {{the next}} {{generation}} version of the Yellowdog Updater, Modified (yum), a package manager for RPM-based distributions. DNF was introduced in Fedora 18, {{and it has been}} the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> manager for Fedora since version 22.|$|E
5000|$|Cabal {{has been}} {{introduced}} to simplify packaging of Haskell software and modules. It {{was added to the}} Glasgow Haskell Compiler version 6.4 as <b>default</b> <b>package</b> manager, [...] along GHC's internal manager ghc-pkg. The actual binary cabal and the library Cabal are developed in different packages.|$|E
50|$|As of {{its version}} 5, JOnAS is fully {{based on the}} OSGi framework; using either Apache Felix, Eclipse Equinox or Knopflerfish (though the <b>default</b> JOnAS <b>packaging</b> comes with Apache Felix). This means that all JOnAS {{components}} are packaged as bundles, for example the full JOnAS profile comes with more than 250 bundles.|$|R
5000|$|The Embedded Device Configuration {{specification}} {{defines the}} minimal embedded standard runtime environment for embedded Java devices.It defines all the <b>default</b> CORE API <b>packages</b> (138 classes/interfaces): ...|$|R
25|$|There {{are more}} Ubuntu {{variants}} (or derivatives) {{based on the}} official Ubuntu editions. These install a <b>default</b> set of <b>packages</b> that differ from the official Ubuntu distributions.|$|R
5000|$|Cygwin's <b>default</b> <b>package</b> {{selection}} is fairly small, containing {{little more than}} the bash shell and the core file manipulation utilities expected of a Unix command line. Additional packages are available as optional installs from within Cygwin's package manager ("setup-x86.exe" [...] - 32bit & [...] "setup-x86_64.exe" [...] - 64bit). These include (among many others): ...|$|E
50|$|AppArmor {{was first}} {{successfully}} ported/packaged for Ubuntu in April 2007. AppArmor became a <b>default</b> <b>package</b> starting in Ubuntu 7.10, and {{came as a}} part of the release of Ubuntu 8.04, protecting only CUPS by default. As of Ubuntu 9.04 more items such as MySQL have installed profiles. AppArmor hardening continued to improve in Ubuntu 9.10 as it ships with profiles for its guest session, libvirt virtual machines, the Evince document viewer, and an optional Firefox profile.|$|E
5000|$|... npm ("Node Package Manager") is {{a package}} {{manager for the}} JavaScript {{programming}} language. It is the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.|$|E
5000|$|... where β0 is a non-random, known {{constant}} {{which may}} or may not match the actual unknown parameter value β, and [...] is the standard error of the estimator [...] for β. By <b>default,</b> statistical <b>packages</b> report t-statistic with β0 [...] 0 (these t-statistics are used to test the significance of corresponding regressor). However, when t-statistic is needed to test the hypothesis of the form H0: β [...] β0, then a non-zero β0 may be used.|$|R
5000|$|User-written {{software}} End-user development tailors {{systems to}} meet users' specific needs. User software include spreadsheet templates and word processor templates. Even email filters are {{a kind of}} user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into <b>default</b> application <b>packages,</b> many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.|$|R
30|$|Second, imperfectly {{optimizing}} individuals {{create an}} additional layer of challenges for providing job training services through market-based mechanisms, a potentially {{efficient way to}} deliver such benefits for standard rational economic actors. But if individuals choose only imperfectly and are greatly swayed by <b>defaults</b> and <b>packaging</b> and framing of information, the resulting market pressures may produce behavior that strays further from optimal outcomes. Market mechanisms in this context should be designed to be robust to such imperfect decision making by beneficiaries.|$|R
5000|$|The {{library is}} {{distributed}} as Free Software {{under the terms}} of either the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) or the Mozilla Public License (MPL). It is platform independent and officially supports several Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and OS X), and Windows. Installation on popular Linux distributions is possible using the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> sources, and even pre-installed in popular desktop systems.TagLib is the base for the [...] "Tagging" [...] capability for a number of media players, including Amarok and VLC media player, however, it is used by the last.fm or the file manager GNOME Commander as well.|$|E
50|$|Under the hood, yum {{depends on}} RPM, {{which is a}} {{packaging}} standard for digital distribution of software, which automatically uses hashes and digisigs to verify the authorship and integrity of said software; unlike some app stores, which serve a similar function, neither yum nor RPM provide built-in support for proprietary restrictions on copying of packages by endusers. Yum is implemented as libraries in the Python programming language, with a small set of programs that provide a command-line interface. GUI-based wrappers such as Yum Extender (yumex) also exist. A rewrite of yum based on libsolv named DNF is currently being developed and replaced yum as the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> manager in Fedora 22.|$|E
5000|$|This is {{the first}} Robot Unicorn Attack to include in-game purchases; the player can buy credits to upgrade his or her unicorn and {{additional}} sound-packs. Erasure's seminal song [...] "Always" [...] - which was a {{main part of the}} original game - {{is not part of the}} <b>default</b> <b>package</b> and must be purchased separately for $0.99. [...] "I will never be able to separate Always from Robot Unicorn Attack," [...] wrote Kieron Gillen in 2010. [...] "I can't even imagine wanting to do such a thing. It'd be like decapitating the Mona Lisa. It merges with the sparkles of sound effects and the explosions of light and makes it complete." [...] The song is not included with the base game due to copyright, and as Adult Swim wanted the game to be free-to-play, it was made into an in-game purchase. Other songs by such bands as Blind Guardian, Slade, Limahl, and Corey Hart are also available for purchase.|$|E
50|$|Apache suEXEC is {{a feature}} of the Apache Web server. It allows users to run CGI and SSI {{applications}} as a different user - normally, all web server processes run as the default web server user (often wwwrun, www-data, Apache or nobody). The suEXEC feature consists of a module for the web server and a binary executable which acts as a wrapper. suEXEC was introduced in Apache 1.2 and is often included in the <b>default</b> Apache <b>package</b> provided by most Linux distributions.|$|R
50|$|Pipeline grants {{developers}} {{the opportunity}} {{to create their own}} plugins to communicate with various grid managers. The <b>default</b> Pipeline <b>package</b> includes the JGDIPlugin and the DRMAAPlugin plugins created for Sun Grid Engine but they may work with Oracle Grid Engine, Univa Grid Engine or Son of Grid Engine. Both plugins are housed under the gridplugins directory which is parented under the dist directory in the installed package of Pipeline. All additional plugins you wish to employ can be downloaded separately.|$|R
50|$|By <b>default</b> {{only the}} <b>packages</b> of the JDK {{standard}} API and extension packages are accessible without needing to set {{where to find}} them. The path for all user-defined packages and libraries must be set in the command-line (or in the Manifest associated with the Jar file containing the classes).|$|R
50|$|Generally speaking, I {{was happy}} with gNewSense 3.0. Being based on Debian, the {{distribution}} {{can be counted on}} to provide both stability and amazing performance. The distribution is lean, fast and uncluttered. The flip side to this is gNewSense's system installer and <b>default</b> <b>package</b> management tools are geared more toward experienced users and will probably provide a steep learning curve to novice Linux users. Not much is automated and there is a minimum of hand holding. The main feature of gNewSense, the lack of proprietary software, is also a double-edged blade. On the one hand, it means the entire operating system can be audited, modified and redistributed. This is great from the perspective of software freedom. The fact that the distribution can play most multimedia formats and handled Flash content fairly well is a testament of the power of free and open source software. The one problem I ran into with gNewSense's software policy was with regards to my wireless network card. Most distributions ship with the non-free Intel firmware, but gNewSense doesn't include it and this means the distribution isn't a good fit with my laptop. It is, on the other hard , a great match with my desktop system.|$|E
40|$|We report {{findings}} {{of an experiment}} in which we investigate whether people choose courses to reduce work-related skill-deficiencies, and whether they choose courses deliberately. In addition, we analyze which personal characteristics deter-mine the outcome of their choices. In a survey we evaluated the levels and require-ments for six different skills of 1, 631 workers 1. 5 years after graduation. Six months later we perform an experiment in which the respondents hypothetically are asked by their employers {{to participate in a}} program of three courses. The respondents have the option to exchange these courses for three other courses. The basic idea is that people will consider the default as an advise about what would be a rea-sonable choice. The actual choice will be based on a combination of this implicit information and the perceptions {{in the mind of the}} respondent. Randomizing the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> of courses, we can identify the deliberateness of their choice. We find that people choose courses in the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> significantly more often, es-pecially when the default course matches their skill-deficiencies. Interestingly, w...|$|E
3000|$|We {{applied the}} {{probability}} model in Equation 1 to a classification tree by calculating the posterior probability of the recruitment classes at each node of the tree. The R package tree {{was used to}} train classifiers grown using recursive partitioning with a deviance criterion to select features at each node [47]. We used the <b>default</b> <b>package</b> parameters to control tree growth, including: minimum within-node deviance = 0.01 (d e v i a n c e [...]...|$|E
5000|$|... up2date on Fedora Core <b>defaults</b> to {{retrieving}} <b>packages</b> from yum repositories. Again, {{other sources}} {{can be added}} (apart from RHN, which is Red Hat Enterprise Linux Specific). As of Fedora Core 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, up2date is no longer shipped with the distribution; yum is used instead.|$|R
50|$|Lubuntu 12.04 was {{released}} with the Linux v3.2.14 Linux kernel and also introduced {{a large number}} of bug fixes, particularly in the LX panel and the PCManFM file manager. Also the Ubuntu Backports repository was enabled by <b>default,</b> meaning backport <b>packages</b> were not installed by default, but once installed were automatically upgraded to newer versions.|$|R
50|$|Debian-based {{distributions}} support GPG {{signature verification}} of signed Debian packages, but most (if not all) have this feature disabled by <b>default.</b> Instead <b>packages</b> are verified by signing the repository metadata (i.e. Release files). The metadata files in turn include checksums for the repository files {{as a means}} to verify authenticity of the files. Currently there are two different implementations for signing individual packages. The first is done via the debsigs / debsig-verify toolset, which is supported by dpkg. The second is done through the dpkg-sig program which is not supported by dpkg, so the packages have to be manually checked with the dpkg-sig program. Both formats add new section(s) to the ar archive to store the signature information, but the formats are not compatible with one another. Neither of the modifications to the package format are listed in the official Debian handbook or man page about the binary package format.|$|R
