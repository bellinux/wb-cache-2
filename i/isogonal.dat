5|$|When {{regarded}} as a star icosahedron, the complete stellation is a noble polyhedron, because it is both isohedral (face-transitive) and <b>isogonal</b> (vertex-transitive).|$|E
5|$|A regular {{tessellation}} is {{a highly}} symmetric, edge-to-edge tiling made up of regular polygons, all of the same shape. There are only three regular tessellations: those made up of equilateral triangles, squares, or regular hexagons. All three of these tilings are <b>isogonal</b> and monohedral.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to tessellate in non-Euclidean geometries such as hyperbolic geometry. A uniform tiling in the hyperbolic plane (which may be regular, quasiregular or semiregular) is an edge-to-edge filling of the hyperbolic plane, with regular polygons as faces; these are vertex-transitive (transitive on its vertices), and <b>isogonal</b> (there is an isometry mapping any vertex onto any other).|$|E
5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} {{technical}} terms when discussing tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an <b>isogonal</b> or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E
5|$|A semi-regular (or Archimedean) {{tessellation}} uses {{more than}} one type of regular polygon in an <b>isogonal</b> arrangement. There are eight semi-regular tilings (or nine if the mirror-image pair of tilings counts as two). These can be described by their vertex configuration; for example, a semi-regular tiling using squares and regular octagons has the vertex configuration 4.82 (each vertex has one square and two octagons). Many non-edge-to-edge tilings of the Euclidean plane are possible, including the family of Pythagorean tilings, tessellations that use two (parameterised) sizes of square, each square touching four squares of the other size. An edge tessellation {{is one in which}} each tile can be reflected over an edge to take up the position of a neighbouring tile, such as in an array of equilateral or isosceles triangles.|$|E
25|$|The <b>isogonal</b> {{conjugate}} of the circumcenter is the orthocenter.|$|E
25|$|<b>Isogonal</b> or vertex-transitive: {{all corners}} lie {{within the same}} {{symmetry}} orbit. The polygon is also cyclic and equiangular.|$|E
25|$|There {{are seven}} {{families}} of <b>isogonal</b> each family having a real-valued parameter determining the overlap between sides of adjacent tiles or the ratio between the edge lengths of different tiles. Two {{of the families}} are generated from shifted square, either progressive or zig-zagging positions. Gr√ºnbaum and Shephard call these tilings uniform although it contradicts Coxeter's definition for uniformity which requires edge-to-edge regular polygons. Such <b>isogonal</b> tilings are actually topologically identical to the uniform tilings, with different geometric proportions.|$|E
25|$|Regular: the polygon is both <b>isogonal</b> and isotoxal. Equivalently, {{it is both}} cyclic and {{equilateral}}, or both equilateral and equiangular. A non-convex {{regular polygon}} is called a regular star polygon.|$|E
2500|$|We can infer {{the proof}} from {{existence}} of <b>isogonal</b> conjugate too. If {{we are to}} show that , , [...] are collinear for conconical , then notice that [...] and [...] are similar, and that [...] and [...] will correspond to the <b>isogonal</b> conjugate if we overlap the similar triangles. This means that , hence making [...] collinear.|$|E

50|$|The <b>isogonal</b> {{conjugate}} of the incentre I is itself. The <b>isogonal</b> conjugate of the orthocentre H is the circumcentre O. The <b>isogonal</b> conjugate of {{the centroid}} G is (by definition) the symmedian point K. The <b>isogonal</b> conjugates of the Fermat points are the isodynamic points and vice versa. The Brocard points are <b>isogonal</b> conjugates of each other.|$|E
50|$|Regular polyhedra are isohedral (face-transitive), <b>isogonal</b> (vertex-transitive) and isotoxal. Quasiregular polyhedra are <b>isogonal</b> and isotoxal, but not isohedral; their duals are isohedral and isotoxal, but not <b>isogonal.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{polyhedron}} {{which is}} isohedral has a dual polyhedron that is vertex-transitive (<b>isogonal).</b> The Catalan solids, the bipyramids and the trapezohedra are all isohedral. They are the duals of the <b>isogonal</b> Archimedean solids, prisms and antiprisms, respectively. The Platonic solids, which are either self-dual or dual with another Platonic solid, are vertex, edge, and face-transitive (<b>isogonal,</b> isotoxal, and isohedral). A polyhedron which is isohedral and <b>isogonal</b> {{is said to}} be noble.|$|E

50|$|As <b>isogonal</b> {{conjugation}} is a function, {{it makes}} sense to speak of the <b>isogonal</b> conjugate of sets of points, such as lines and circles. For example, the <b>isogonal</b> conjugate of a line is a circumconic; specifically, an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola according as the line intersects the circumcircle in 0, 1, or 2 points. The <b>isogonal</b> conjugate of the circumcircle is the line at infinity. Several well-known cubics (e.g., Thompson cubic, Darboux cubic, Neuberg cubic) are self-isogonal-conjugate, in the sense that if X is on the cubic, then X &minus;1 is also on the cubic.|$|E
50|$|Many {{times in}} geometry, {{if we take}} three special lines through the {{vertices}} of a triangle, or cevians, then their reflections about the corresponding angle bisectors, called <b>isogonal</b> lines, will also have interesting properties. For instance, if three cevians of a triangle intersect at a point P, then their <b>isogonal</b> lines also intersect at a point, called the <b>isogonal</b> conjugate of P.|$|E
