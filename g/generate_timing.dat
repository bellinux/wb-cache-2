40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of real world applications often critically {{depends on a}} few computationally intensive routines that are either in-voked numerous times by the application and/or include {{a significant number of}} loop iterations.

This paper presents a framework for automatically <b>generating</b> <b>timing</b> drivers that independently measure the performance of critical routines sepa-rately from their original applications.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{objective of this}} research has been {{the creation of a}} hardware design for a Predictive Read Cache (PRC). The PRC is a developmental cache intended to replace second-level caches common in modern microprocessor systems. The PRC has the potential of being faster and cheaper than current second-level caches and is distinctive in its ability to predict data addresses to be referenced by a central processing unit. Previous research has analyzed the behavior that the PRC must exhibit. During the described research, the behavior was modeled in the Verilog hardware description language. Verilog-XL was used for simulation, which uses the Verilog behavioral model as input. The behavioral model suggests that the internal structure of the PRC could be divided into six modules, each performing part of the function of the whole PRC. Each of these blocks was studied for hardware equivalents, easing the development of the total structural model.

Generally in real-time systems, the WCET of a program is a crucial component, which is the longest execution time of a specified task.

The Electronics Development group at TRIUMF/ISAC has previously developed VME modules [1] for the ISAC facility. This success led to development of several purpose built modules. Specifically for TITAN (TRIUMF’s Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science) five VME modules were developed: a frequency generator for the RFQ cooler with an output {{in the range}} of 200 kHz to 1. 2 MHz 1 Vp-p sine wave, a gate trigger module to <b>generate</b> <b>timing</b> pulses for injection and extraction of the ion beam, a 6 -channel high voltage module to provide the extraction voltages adjustable from 0 - 2000 V, an 8 -channel +/- 40 V power supply used in setting the trap DC levels, and an 8 -channel 12 or 16 bit scanning ADC with a single 16 bit DAC.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for problems of estimating deterministic parameters {{in the presence of}} random nuisance parameters has usually been hard, due to the total probability structure of the marginal likelihood function. Alternative bounds exist, but they are either not looser than the CRB, or apply only to restricted classes of estimators. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, we present a family of tighter bounds, the modified Bhattacharyya bound (MBB) as extensions of an existing bound in the literature. Case studies on synchronization problems show that the MBB 2 ̆ 7 s can be much tighter than the Cramér-Rao bound (CRB). As an analogy, another family of bounds, the modified Bhattacharyya bound 2 (MBB 2) is also derived for the class of uniformly unbiased estimators. ^ Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is being used or under consideration for a variety of new wireless applications. The communication channels for some of these applications are highly dispersive, requiring synchronization algorithms which are robust to channel dispersion. In the second part of this dissertation, we present a blind OFDM synchronization technique, the Minimum-Interference-Power (MIP) algorithms, which exploits the significant self-interference energy buildup in the presence of synchronization errors. The MIP algorithms <b>generate</b> <b>timing</b> and frequency offset estimates based on the FFT sequence of the oversampled received signal. For OFDM systems with virtual carrier (VC), the same principle can be applied based on the VC without oversampling the received signal. The VC-based MIP frequency estimator is identical to an existing blind frequency estimator. To mitigate the complexity issue, we propose a two-stage estimation structure as well as a variant of the MIP estimator. Performance study via simulation shows that the MIP estimators are very robust against channel dispersion, and produces excellent estimates. A three-step hybrid estimator which combines existing cyclic prefix (CP) -based technique and the MIP technique is presented and shown to have better performance than the both component techniques for SNR up to 32 dB. The document concludes with some discussions on the use of MIP timing estimators for channel length determination. ...|$|E

40|$|The ever {{expanding}} {{range of}} applications for embedded systems continues to offer new challenges (and opportunities) to chip manufacturers. Applications ranging from exciting high resolution gaming to routine tasks like temperature control {{need to be}} supported on increasingly small devices with shrinking dimensions and tighter energy budgets. These systems benefit greatly by having the capability to operate {{over a wide range}} of supply voltages, known as ultra dynamic voltage scaling (U-DVS). This refers to systems capable of operating from nominal voltages down to sub-threshold voltages. Memories {{play an important role in}} these systems with future chips estimated to have over 80 % of chip area occupied by memories. This thesis presents the design and characterization of an ultra dynamic voltage scalable memory (SRAM) that functions from nominal voltages down to sub-threshold voltages without the need for external support. The key contributions of the thesis are as follows: 1) A variation tolerant reference generation for single ended sensing: We present a reference generator, for U-DVS memories, that tracks the memory over a wide range of voltages and is tunable to allow functioning down to sub-threshold voltages. Replica columns are used to generate the reference voltage which allows the technique to track slow changes such as temperature and aging. A few configurable cells in the replica column are found to be sufficient to cover the whole range of voltages of interest. The use of tunable delay line to <b>generate</b> <b>timing</b> is shown to help in overcoming the effects of process variations. 2) Random-sampling based tuning algorithm: Tuning is necessary to overcome the in-creased effects of variation at lower voltages. We present an random-sampling based BIST tuning algorithm that significantly speed-up the tuning ensuring that the time required to tune is comparable to a single MBIST algorithm. Further, the use of redundancy after delay tuning enables maximum utilization of redundancy infrastructure to reduce power consumption and enhance performance. 3) Testing and Characterization for U-DVS systems: Testing and characterization is an important challenge in U-DVS systems that have remained largely unexplored. We propose an iterative technique that allows realization of an on-chip oscilloscope with minimal area overhead. The all digital nature of the technique makes it simple to design and implement across technology nodes. Combining the proposed techniques allows the designed 4 Kb SRAM array to function from 1. 2 V down to 310 mV with reads functioning down to 190 mV. This would contribute towards moving ultra wide voltage operation a step closer towards implementation in commercial designs...|$|E
40|$|I study {{various aspects}} of mutual funds in my thesis. These are divided over four chapters. The first chapter is an {{introduction}} to the thesis and sets out an executive summary of my research. The second to fourth chapters each deal with a new concept. The second chapter shows that the sensitivity of an investor's reaction to a mutual fund's recent performance increases with the fund's historical performance. Put differently, bad (good) performance combined with a good-history for a fund results in a greater fraction of capital outflows (inflows) relative to a fund with a poor past history. The evidence is puzzling as we would expect investors to stick with a fund having a good-history, even after a single bad performance. I solve this problem using a model with investors of differing attentiveness. In equilibrium, fund owner's attentiveness increases the historical record of a fund. With this mechanism, the model can explain the higher sensitivity of outflows for higher reputation funds. The chapter is important in that it shows that return-chasing behavior is not ubiquitous. It also provides a clear evidence where the market is slow to incorporate the new information into decision making. The third chapter studies the managerial side of the mutual funds industry regarding the risk-taking behavior of the mutual funds. Mutual fund managers are compared against a benchmark or with the peers. The employment, as well as investor's capital flows, depends on how the manager fares in the competition. I present new evidence in the chapter that the exposure of a manager to these risks is heterogeneous, and manager's historical performance governs it. The evidence implies that the risk-appetite and behavior of a manager depends on his historical performance. I find strong support in the data for this hypothesis. I show that funds with poor historical performance do not boost the portfolio risk {{to catch up with the}} peers if they are lagging at the interim date. In general, the risk appetite of the poor-history manager is less driven by their interim performance. But the good-history managers respond to their midyear position and more so during the bull years. The evidence on risk-shifting is consistent with the evidence on how each incentive behaves for good and poor history managers over bull and bear phases. The fourth chapter shows that capital movement in and out of a mutual fund is more sensitive to fund performance during periods of high market volatility. I explain this result using a model where the manager has picking as well as timing skill. A volatile market presents an opportunity to <b>generate</b> <b>timing</b> value and to that extent produces speedy learning about managerial timing ability. Persistence in volatility boosts the sensitivity of flows to performance during such times. Given the counter-cyclical nature of market volatility, the model predicts that the flow sensitivity is higher during the recessions. Data supports the model prediction. The chapter provides a clear example when the trade volume (here capital flows) is linked positively with the volatility. Usually, literature has shown how the volatile periods slows the learning and hence trade volumes too. But my model indicates that there could be substantial learning going on during volatile times about critical economics parameters, mainly because those parameters are revealed only during volatile times...|$|E
40|$|In {{high-power}} electric drives, multilevel inverters {{are generally}} deployed {{to address issues}} such as electromagnetic interference, switch voltage stress and harmonic distortion. The switching frequency of the inverter is always kept low, {{of the order of}} 1 KHz or even less to reduce switching losses and synchronous pulse width modulation (PWM) is used to avoid the problem of sub-harmonics and beat frequencies. This is particularly important if the switching frequency is very low. The synchronous PWM is getting popularity as its realization is very easy with digital controllers compared to analog controllers. Neutral-point-clamped (NPC) inverters, cascaded H-bridge, and flying-capacitor multilevel inverters are some of the popular schemes used for high-power applications. Hybrids of these multilevel inverters have also been proposed recently {{to take advantage of the}} basic configurations. Multilevel inverters can also be realized by feeding the induction motor from both ends (open-end winding) using conventional inverter structures. For controlling the output voltage of these inverters, various PWM techniques are used. Chapter- 1 of this thesis provides an over view of the various multilevel inverter schemes preceded by a discussion on basic two-level VSI topology. The inverters used in motor drive applications have to be operated in over-modulation range in order to extract the maximum fundamental output voltage that is possible from the dc-link. Operation in this high modulation range is required to meet temporary overloads or to have maximum power operation in the high speed range (flux weakened region). This, however, introduces a substantial amount of low order harmonics in the Motor phase voltages. Due to these low-order harmonic frequencies, the dynamic performance of the drive is lost and the current control schemes are severely affected especially due to 5 th and 7 th harmonic components. Further, due to these low-order harmonics and non-linear PWM operation in over-modulation region, frequent over-current fault conditions occur and reliability of the drive is jeopardized. The twelve sided-polygonal space vector diagram (dodecagonal space vectors) can be used to overcome the problem of low order 5 th and 7 th harmonics and to give more range for linear modulation while keeping the switching frequency at a minimum compared to conventional hexagonal space vector based inverters. Thus, the dodecagonal space-vector switching can be viewed as an engineering compromise between low switching frequency and quality load current waveform. Most of the previous works of dodecagonal space-vector generation schemes are based on NPC inverters. However, sophisticated charge control schemes are required in NPC inverters to deal with the neutral-point voltage fluctuation and the neutral-point voltage shifting issues. The losses in the clamping diodes are another major concern. In the second chapter, a multilevel dodecagonal space-vector generation scheme based on flying capacitor topology, utilizing an open end winding induction motor is presented. The neutral point charge-balancing problem reported in the previous works is not present in this scheme, the clamping diodes are eliminated and the number of power supplies required has been reduced. The capacitors have inherent charge balancing capability, and the charge control is done once in every switching cycle, which gives tight voltage control for the capacitors. For the speed control of induction motors, the space-vector PWM scheme is more advantageous than the sine-triangle PWM as it gives a more linear range of operation and improved harmonic performance. One major disadvantage with the conventional space-vector PWM is that the trigonometric operations demand formidable computational efforts and look-up tables. Carrier based, common-mode injected PWM schemes have been proposed to simplify the PWM process. However, the freedom of selecting the PWM switching sequences is limited here. Another way of obtaining SVPWM is using the reference voltage samples and the nearest vector information to switch appropriate devices for proper time intervals, realizing the reference vector in an average sense. In-formation regarding the sector and nearest vectors can be easily obtained by comparing the instantaneous amplitudes of the reference voltages. This PWM approach is pro-posed for the speed control of the motor in this thesis. The trigonometric operations and the requirement of large look-up tables in the conventional SVPWM are avoided in this method. It has the additional advantage that the switching sequences can be decided at will, which is helpful in reducing further, the harmonic distortion in certain frequency ranges. In this way, this method tries to combine the advantages of vector based methods (conventional SVPWM) and scalar methods (carrier-based methods). The open-end winding schemes allowed the required phase voltage levels to be generated quite easily by feeding from both ends of the windings. Thus, most of the multilevel inverters based on dodecagonal space-vector structures relied on induction motors with open-end windings. The main disadvantage of open-end winding induction motor is that six wires are to be run from the inverter to the motor, which may be unacceptable in certain applications. Apart from the inconvenience of laying six wires, the voltage reflections in the wires can lead to over voltages at the motor terminals, causing insulation failures. Where as the topology presented in chapter- 2 of this thesis uses open-end winding motor with flying-capacitor inverters for the generation of dodecagonal space-vectors, the topology presented in chapter- 3 utilizes a cascade connection of flying-capacitors and floating H-bridge cells to generate the same set of voltage space-vectors, thus allowing any standard induction motor as the load. Of the methods used for the speed control of induction motors, namely sine-triangle PWM and space vector PWM, the latter that provides extra modulation range is naturally preferred. It is a well-understood fact that the way in which the PWM switching sequences are applied has a significant influence on the harmonic performance of the drive. However, this topic has not been addressed properly for dodecagonal voltage space-vector based multilevel inverter drives. In chapter- 4 of the thesis, this aspect is taken into ac-count and the notion of “harmonic flux trajectories” and “stator flux ripple” are used to analyze the harmonic performance of the various PWM switching schemes. Although the PWM method used in this study is similar to that in chapter- 2, the modification in the PWM switching sequence in the PWM algorithm yields significant improvements in harmonic performance. The proposed topologies and PWM schemes are extensively simulated and experimentally verified. The control scheme was implemented using a DSP processor running at a clock frequency 150 MHz and a four-pole, 3. 7 kW, 50 Hz, 415 V three-phase induction motor was used as the load. Since the PWM ports are limited in a DSP, a ﬁeld-programmable gate array (FPGA) was used to decode the PWM signals from the DSP to <b>generate</b> <b>timing</b> information required for PWM sequencing for all the power devices. The same FPGA was used to generate the dead-time signals for the power devices also...|$|E
