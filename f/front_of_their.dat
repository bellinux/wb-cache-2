5|$|Kepler-11 and its planets were {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler Mission, a mission tasked with discovering planets in transit around their stars. The transit method that Kepler uses involves detecting dips in brightness in stars.

Kepler-11 is the first discovered exoplanetary system with more than three transiting planets.|$|E

50|$|Eventually all twelve Class 16 {{locomotives}} were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2B boilers and reclassified to Class 16R.

5|$|Kepler-9d's {{name comes}} from it being the third planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-9. Kepler-9 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite that aims to discover terrestrial planets in transit around, or crossing in <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> host stars as seen from Earth. This transit causes a regular interval in which the star briefly and slightly dims as the planet crosses it.|$|E

In Montenegro, decasyllable Serbian epics are sung to an accompaniment played on the gusle, a traditional Serbian bowed string instrument. The celebration ends with parishioners gathered around the fire, served with cooked rakia, wine, or tea, and the food allowed during the Nativity Fast.

5|$|All known planets transit the star; {{this means}} that all six planets' orbits appear to cross in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> star as viewed from the Earth's perspective. Their inclinations {{relative}} to Earth's line of sight, or how far above or below the plane of sight they are, vary by {{a little more than}} a degree. This allows direct measurements of the planets' periods and relative diameters (compared to the host star) by monitoring each planet's transit of the star. Simulations suggest that the mean mutual inclinations of the planetary orbits are about 1°, meaning the system is probably more coplanar (flatter) than the Solar System, where the corresponding figure is 2.3°.|$|E

5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> own goal. Though {{there are a variety}} of positions in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 b {{was one of}} {{a sample}} of over 300 very-low-mass stars {{targeted}} by astronomers in search of planets that may orbit such stars. Using the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) at La Silla Observatory in Chile, six years of radial velocity data led the astronomers in the discovery of eleven other planets. After these discoveries, the astronomers chose to refocus their search on short-period planets, hoping to follow up after discoveries using the radial velocity method with a search for planets that also transited, or crossed in <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> host stars as seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b's {{existence}} was first suggested after observations by the six-telescope HATnet collaboration, {{a project that}} searches the sky for planets in transit of, or crossing in <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> host stars. The presence of a planet in HAT-P-33's orbit had been suspected as early as 2004, although high levels of jitter were detected. This jitter, or a random and shaky appearance that clouds the accuracy of measurements, {{made it difficult to}} easily verify the radial velocity of the planetary candidate's host star, which usually leads summarily to the planet's confirmation.|$|E

Again, the Lakers reached the finals, and again, they battled the Celtics. With West not yet in shape, Baylor and the Lakers fell back 3–2; then they succumbed in Game 6 in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> home crowd with a 112–109 loss. As the game ended, veteran Celtics playmaker Bob Cousy threw the ball high into the rafters of the L.A. Sports Arena.|$|E
5|$|In the Carnian {{stage of}} the Late Triassic (228.0 - 216.5 Mya), capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar Metoposauridae. Metoposaurids are {{distinguished}} from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets near the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> skulls. Another group of stereospondyls, the plagiosaurs, had wide heads with external gills, and adapted to life {{at the bottom of}} lakes and rivers. By this time, temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems. Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which was covered in temperate forests at the time.|$|E

These changes were necessary due to the Taylor Report, which required all clubs in the highest two divisions of English football to have an all-seater stadium by August 1994.|$|E

50|$|All thirty Class 12B {{locomotives}} {{were eventually}} reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers.

Upon reboilering, the unknown original reason for the separate classification was ignored and instead of becoming Class 12BR, the reboilered locomotives were reclassified to Class 12R along with the reboilered Class 12 locomotives.|$|R
5|$|Kepler-5 {{is named}} so {{because it was}} the fifth planet-bearing star {{discovered}} {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA operation that seeks to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> host stars with respect to Earth. The star's planet, Kepler-5b, was the second of the first five planets to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets found by Kepler were used as tests, and had already been discovered. Kepler-5b was presented to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-6, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6 {{was named}} for the Kepler Mission, a NASA and {{accomplishment}} project launched in 2009 that aims to discover Earth-like planets that transit, or cross in <b>front</b> <b>of,</b> <b>their</b> home stars with respect to Earth. Unlike stars like the Sun or Sirius, Kepler-6 {{does not have a}} common and colloquial name. The discovery of Kepler-6b was announced by the Kepler team on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society along with planets around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-7, and Kepler-8. It was the third planet to be discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets to be verified by data from Kepler had been previously discovered. These three planets were used to test the accuracy of Kepler's measurements.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8b is {{the fifth}} of the first five exoplanets {{discovered}} by NASA's Kepler spacecraft, which aims to discover planets in a region of the sky between the constellations Lyra and Cygnus that transit (cross in <b>front</b> <b>of)</b> <b>their</b> host stars. The planet is the hottest of the five. Kepler-8b was the only planet discovered in Kepler-8's orbit, and is larger (though more diffuse) than Jupiter. It orbits its host star every 3.5 days. The planet also demonstrates the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, where the planet's orbit affects the redshifting of the spectrum of the host star. Kepler-8b was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 {{at a conference in}} Washington, D.C. after radial velocity measurements conducted at the W.M. Keck Observatory confirmed its detection by Kepler.|$|E
