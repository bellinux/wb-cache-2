5|$|Debs {{attended}} public school, {{dropping out}} of high school at age 14. He took a job with the Vandalia Railroad cleaning grease from the trucks of freight engines for fifty cents a day. He later became a painter and car cleaner in the railroad shops. In December 1871, when a drunken locomotive <b>fireman</b> failed to report for work, Debs was pressed into service as a night <b>fireman.</b> He decided to remain a <b>fireman</b> on the run between Terre Haute and Indianapolis, earning more than a dollar a night for the next three and half years.|$|E

5|$|At Tomorrowland Station {{in early}} 2004, {{accumulated}} diesel fumes in the firebox of the DRR's No. 3 locomotive exploded after its fire suddenly went out. The explosion ejected the engineer from the locomotive's cab and inflicted serious burns on the <b>fireman.</b>|$|E
5|$|Even {{before leaving}} the Brooklyn Navy Yard on June 29, 1871, the {{expedition}} ran into personnel troubles. The cook, a seaman, a <b>fireman,</b> and assistant engineer Wilson deserted. The steward {{turned out to be}} a drunk, and was left in port.|$|E
5|$|The {{line had}} no signals or {{automatic}} points {{to control the}} switching between lines at junctions with the main line and with the sidings. On the approach to a level crossing the <b>fireman</b> ran ahead with a red flag, to stop the traffic; he also manually operated the points.|$|E

5|$|The team {{played on}} a {{strictly}} amateur basis for 1895 at least, with a team featuring a number of works employees including Thomas Freeman (ships <b>fireman),</b> Walter Parks (clerk), Tom Mundy, Walter Tranter and James Lindsay (all boilermakers), William Chapman, George Sage, and William Chamberlain and apprentice riveter Charlie Dove.|$|E
5|$|The tender {{included}} a corridor connection and tunnel {{through the water}} tank giving access to the locomotive cab from the train so that the driver and <b>fireman</b> could be changed without stopping the train. The following year the locomotive appeared in the film The Flying Scotsman.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Merchant Navy class, {{electric}} lighting was provided on both locomotive and footplate, {{powered by a}} steam-powered generator below the footplate. The gauges were lit by ultra-violet light. This enabled clearer night-time vision of the boiler steam pressure gauge and the brake pipe vacuum pressure gauge whilst eliminating dazzle, {{making it easier for}} the crew to see signals along the track. Close attention was paid to the ergonomics of the cab, which was designed with the controls required for operation grouped according to the needs of both driver and <b>fireman,</b> thus promoting safe operation. As an aid to the <b>fireman,</b> a treadle used steam pressure to open the firehole doors, where the coal is shovelled into the firebox. The footplate was entirely enclosed, improving crew working conditions in winter. Other refinements and innovations used on the Merchant Navy class included steam-powered clasp brakes and the unusual 6ft 2 in (1.88 m) Bulleid Firth Brown (BFB) wheels.|$|E

5|$|At around 2:00am on July 17, {{the first}} act of {{violence}} in Baltimore emerged. According to the newspaper reports the following day, a westbound train was thrown from the tracks at a switch in a suburb south of the city. The switch had been opened and locked by an unknown person. The engine caught fire, and the engineer and the <b>fireman</b> aboard were severely injured.|$|E
5|$|Lovefilm (1970) {{focuses on}} a young man’s {{relationship}} with his childhood sweetheart, told through flashbacks that include the Arrow Cross dictatorship and 1956, and rendered in an experimental, fragmented form. This experimental tendency in Szabó’s films reached its apotheosis in 25 <b>Fireman</b> Street (1973), which began as a short film, Dream About a House (1971). 25 <b>Fireman</b> Street takes place {{during the course of}} a long, hot night in Budapest, during which the residents of a single apartment building are plagued by dream-memories of pain and loss spanning thirty years, including both World Wars, the Arrow Cross dictatorship, the Communist takeover, and 1956. While the film won the top prize at Locarno, Szabó was upset by its lack of success at the box office and at film festivals. Attributing this lack of success to the film's complex structure, he decided to give his next film a simpler structure.|$|E

5|$|On 13 April 1948, {{the goods}} hoist to the Waterloo and City line began to sink while a M7 class tank engine was pushing loaded coal wagons onto it. The engine {{dropped into the}} hoist's shaft, ending up {{upside-down}} and spurting steam over it. The driver and <b>fireman</b> managed to jump free, and the locomotive was rescued piecemeal and used for spares.|$|E
5|$|On February 19, 1904, a Baltimore and Ohio train accidentally {{crossed the}} Big Four Bridge, due to {{engineer}} Dick Foreman falling asleep and going {{the wrong way}} at Otisco, Indiana. The <b>fireman</b> kept shoveling coal and did not pay attention. It was the conductor that finally noticed the error midway across the Big Four Bridge. The wayward train had to back {{up all the way}} back to Otisco.|$|E

5|$|To {{strengthen}} the city's firefighting capabilities, the city established a reserve unit called the Exempt Fireman's Company, so called {{because it was}} made up of firemen who were exempt from militia and jury duty. The company was led by veteran <b>fireman</b> Zophar Mills, who had helped stop the great 1835 fire from crossing Wall Street.|$|E
5|$|Willis {{teamed up}} with 50 Cent in a film {{directed}} by David Barrett called Fire with Fire, starring opposite Josh Duhamel and Rosario Dawson, about a <b>fireman</b> who must save {{the love of his}} life. Willis also joined Vince Vaughn and Catherine Zeta-Jones in Lay the Favorite, directed by Stephen Frears, about a Las Vegas cocktail waitress who becomes an elite professional gambler. The two films were distributed by Lionsgate Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the <b>fireman</b> to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
