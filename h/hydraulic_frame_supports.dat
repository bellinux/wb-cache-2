Main design points and structural measures of transformation layer in <b>frame</b> <b>supported</b> shear wall structure was discussed which has certain reference value to engineering design personnel. Introduction： To {{meet the requirements of}} bottom large space for structure function in modern high-rise buildings, vertical components of upper part cannot be connected to ground directly and transformation layer structure is usually adopted. The common styles of transformation layer structure are beam conversion, plate type conversion, etc. Because of its clear force transmissio...|$|R

The {{stiffness}} {{analysis method}} considering uncertainty parameters of <b>frame</b> <b>hydraulic</b> press with movable eccentricity loading {{in the early}} design stage was proposed. The mathematical analytical stiffness of the upper beam with movable eccentricity loading was built. The adaptive Monte Carlo Method was {{used to calculate the}} interval of the stiffness with random parameters. The result shows that the stiffness appears higher when the eccentricity increasing. The approach has been tested by measuring the stiffness of a 10000 kN <b>frame</b> <b>hydraulic</b> press and a 15000 kN <b>frame</b> <b>hydraulic</b> press...|$|R

40|$|Ingenium AS is {{developing}} a new concept for transporting and installing fixed wind turbines, mainly jacket structures. As {{a part of the}} installation the jacket is lowered down to the seabed from a free hanging configuration, <b>supported</b> by a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>frame.</b> This operation is analyzed by use of the computer program Orcaflex, where the structure is modeled as rigid. Two critical scenarios are identified. In Scenario 1 a the jacket is 10 m above seabed. Here, the jacket may collide with the <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> if the motions are sufficiently large. In Scenario 2 a, the jacket is 3 m above seabed, and large motions may cause troubles under installation. Both these Scenarios are modeled and investigated by running response analyses in Orcaflex. The effect of applying a passive heave compensation system is also investigated. Damping characteristics for the system are provided by Ingenium. By these damping characteristics, the heave compensation system is implemented in the Orcaflex models. Contact between the <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> and the jacket legs may occur if the jacket motions are sufficiently large. The effect of applying a bumper system to reduce the stress in the jacket legs is investigated. This is done by attaching a bumper to the <b>support</b> <b>frame</b> in Scenario 1 a, and use different materials with different contact stiffness for the bumper analysis. All scenarios are run with different environmental conditions. A matrix which defines the different cases for each scenario with respect to load parameters is established. Modal analyses with different line length are performed to see what effect the line length has on the natural frequency of the system. </p...|$|R
