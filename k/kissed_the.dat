The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.|$|E

In addition to appearing in four films she toured Scotland and Ireland {{as part of a}} vaudeville show. She also appeared in the King George Silver Jubilee program in 1935. Her film Java Head (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, {{one of the most famous}} stars of the Beijing Opera. She had long been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong if she ever visited China.|$|E

Rupert practised etching, played tennis, practised shooting, read military textbooks and was taken on accompanied hunting trips. He also entered into a romantic affair with Susan Kuffstein, the daughter of Count von Kuffstein, his gaoler. He received a present of a rare white poodle that Rupert called Boy, or sometimes Pudel, and which remained with him into the English Civil War. Despite attempts by a Franco-Swedish army to seize Linz and free Rupert, his release was ultimately negotiated through Leopold and the Empress Maria Anna; in exchange for a commitment never again to take up arms against the Emperor, Rupert would be released. Rupert formally <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> Emperor's hand at the end of 1641, turned down a final offer of an Imperial command and left Germany for England.|$|E

5|$|Two {{bishops and}} a hermit came to Vladimir, {{gave him a}} wooden cross, and {{confirmed}} that the tsar had made a pledge of faith on it. Vladimir <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> cross and clutched it to his chest, collected a few followers, and set off for Prespa. As he arrived, on 22May 1016, he went into a church to pray. When he exited the church, he was struck down by Vladislav's soldiers and beheaded. According to Skylitzes, Vladimir believed Vladislav's pledge, told {{to him by the}} Bulgarian archbishop David. He then allowed himself to fall into Vladislav's hands, and was executed. The motivation behind the murder is unclear. Since Samuel's defeat in 1014, the Bulgarians had been losing battle after battle, and Vladislav probably suspected or was informed that Vladimir planned to restore Duklja's alliance with Byzantium. This alliance would be particularly disturbing for Tsar Vladislav because of the proximity of Duklja to Dyrrhachium, which was a target of the tsar's war efforts.|$|E

Following the ceremony, the Queen kissed Louise, and Lorne – {{now a member of}} the royal family, but still a subject – <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> Queen's hand.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>kiss</b> on <b>the</b> lips can be {{performed}} between two friends or family. This move aims to express the affection that you have for a friend.

Two days later a Polish envoy, Paweł Działyński, arrived at the palace in Greenwich. Brought to the reception hall, he found Elizabeth sitting on the throne under the canopy of state with all her nobles in attendance. The ambassador presented his credentials, and <b>kissed</b> <b>the</b> Queen's hand extended to him―a gesture of royal favour.

In Latin, he hectored, admonished and criticized the queen, and declared an ultimatum of capitulation to terms or hostile action.|$|E
