25|$|Mongolia's Southern and Central Zones occupy terrain {{traditionally}} used by nomadic herdsmen. Diverting already scarce {{water resources}} to mining could jeopardize their livelihoods. In harsh conditions of Gobi desert herders {{have a very}} specific way of organizing summer pasture and its rotation, access to water, hay collection and <b>hay</b> <b>storage.</b> Any changes to these unique practises hamper the livelihoods of nomads. Steel fence that surrounds the gaping mine blocks traditional herding corridors and {{makes it difficult for}} the herd animals to find water. Roads constructed by the mine owners present additional barriers to animals.|$|E
25|$|Similarities {{between the}} English and New England barn are that {{buildings}} {{were used for}} multiple purposes: the cows were in tie-ups {{on one side of}} the main floor, typically a narrower space on the warmer side of the building, and <b>hay</b> <b>storage</b> and a stable were in the other side, typically the colder side. Both types of barns were sometimes built with big doors on both ends of the drive floor so a wagon team could drive through and generally called a drive through barn. Occasionally the back door was small and only used for ventilation or winnowing. There were likely loose poles called a scaffold on the beams above the drive floor and loft floors above the tie-ups. There may be a transom window above the barn doors and windows were used as needed in some of the walls, but more windows are likely to be found in the New England barn. The roofs of the three-bay barns frequently have no overhang on the eaves or sidewalls, but some New England barns have original, built in roof overhangs.|$|E
2500|$|Because {{this type}} of farm {{combines}} living quarters, stalls and <b>hay</b> <b>storage</b> under one roof it is also described as an Einhaus ("single house" [...] or [...] "all-in-one house") and the attached farmyard as an Eindachhof ("single-roofed farmyard"). A special feature of the Low German house is its longitudinal division, {{also referred to as}} dreischiffige or [...] "triple-aisled". This is considerably different from all-in-one farmhouses elsewhere in Germany and Europe which are built with traditional transverse divisions, as in the Ernhaus, not to mention other common farm layouts where the farm comprises several buildings with different functions, usually around a farmyard.|$|E
2500|$|The human-caused {{extinction}} of the tarpan began in Southern Europe, possibly in antiquity. [...] While humans had been hunting wild horses since the Paleolithic, during historic times horse meat {{was an important}} source of protein for many cultures. As large herbivores, the range of the tarpan was continuously decreased by the increasing civilization of the Eurasian continent. Wild horses were further persecuted because they caused damage to <b>hay</b> <b>storages</b> and often took domestic mares from pastures. Furthermore, interbreeding with wild horses was an economic loss for farmers since the foals of such matings were intractable. Tarpans survived the longest in the southern parts of the Russian steppe. By 1880, when most [...] "tarpans" [...] may have become hybrids, wild horses became very rare. In 1879 the last scientifically confirmed individual was killed. After that, only dubious sightings were documented. As the tarpan horse died out in the wild between 1875 and 1890, the last considered-wild mare was accidentally killed during an attempt at capture. The last captive tarpan died in 1909 in a Russian zoo.|$|R

50|$|The early pioneers {{brought with}} them a barn design {{inherited}} from the first colonists. An average English barn measured thirty feet by forty feet and had a large double wagon door on its lateral side and unpainted vertical boards covering the walls. English barns were normally without a basement and stood on level ground. The interior of the barns were characterized by a center driveway which acted as a threshing floor, similar to the breezeway of a crib barn. The double doors generally opened onto the center drive which divided the building into two separate areas, one for <b>hay</b> and grain <b>storage</b> {{and the other for}} livestock.|$|R

40|$|Hay {{that has}} been baled with {{incorrect}} moisture content or {{that has been}} {{under the influence of}} moisture has potential to generate heat and create a fire hazard. Traditional means of monitoring baled <b>hay</b> temperature in <b>storage,</b> by inserting a pipe probe with thermometer, are time consuming. A ZigBee wireless sensor network could be used to remotely monitor internal hay bale temperatures. Tests were conducted to determine the maximum amount of hay through which a 2. 4 GHz ZigBee module could transmit data and the resulting signal strength (RSSI). Based on analysis of the data, a ZigBee transmitter with 2 mW transmitting power can transmit data through 9 ft of baled hay and a ZigBee transmitter with 50 mW transmitting power can transmit data through 18 ft of baled hay. In general, RSSI decreased significantly with each additional 3 ft of baled hay...|$|R

40|$|In a {{research}} program being performed at The Ohio State University, the agronomic and engineering properties of flue gas desulfurization by-products are being evaluated. The {{purpose of this}} project is to identify potentially beneficial uses for these materials {{and in so doing}} reduce the amount of by-product that must be disposed of in landfills. The results of the experimental program have demonstrated that FGD by-products possess the physical properties that should make them suitable for use as a select fill in a variety of construction projects. To verify the laboratory findings on a larger scale, work was begun on a number of field demonstration projects in which the behavior of the FGD could be evaluated under actual field conditions. Two of these field projects were conducted at an Ohio State University research farm where both wet and dry FGD materials were used to stabilize the soil bases in cattle feedlots. Ash from American Electric Power`s Tidd PFBC plant in Brilliant, Ohio was placed in three lots each designed to accommodate approximately fifty animals. Stability wet scrubber sludge from AEP`s Conesville, Ohio plant was placed at two <b>hay</b> bale <b>storage</b> and Winter feeding sites. The construction of the test plots is described.

40|$|This trial {{aimed at}} {{determining}} the dehydration curve at nine times (0, 3, 6, 9, 24, 27, 30, 33 and 46 hours after cuting of the plants); the leaf/stem ratio {{and number of}} leaves per stem in alfalfa submitted to four managements during the drying process. It was also evaluated the bromatologic composition and in vitro digestibility of the dry matter and cell wall of alfalfa <b>hay</b> before <b>storage.</b> The drying methods applied for alfalfa were the following: drying in the field until 50 % DM and drying conclusion in an airy shed; drying in the field without turning; drying with only one turning and drying with two turnings. The experimental design was completely randomized with four drying methods and five replications. Leaf dehydration was faster {{when compared to the}} stems in all drying methods. Drying in the shed promoted the lesser re-hydration of the plants at night due to dew. It was also verified that alfalfa hays that remained under the sun and were turned showed the worst quality with reduction in crude protein contents and increase in NDF, ADF, NDIN and ADIN. However, in vitro dry matter digestibility and cell wall digestibility did not suffer any alteration because of the different dehydration methods (69. 79 and 41. 39 %, respectively).

50|$|The {{earliest}} round barns tend to {{have several}} flat sides, usually twelve or sixteen. They {{also tend to be}} wood-sided while the later round barns are more often faced with brick or glazed tile. The interior design of round barns shifted as well. The early round barns had cattle stanchions on the first floor with the whole of the loft used for <b>hay</b> and feed <b>storage.</b> Later barns possessed a central space which rose up from the ground level through the entire building. The cattle stanchions in this variation of round barn were arranged around a circular manger on the lower level. Above the stanchion level a circular wagon drive allowed hay to be unloaded into the central mow as the wagon circled the perimeter. The final stage of interior design in round barns included a storage silo {{through the center of the}} structures. These were not really added until silos became fixtures of American farms. Sometimes the central silo would project up through the roof.|$|R

50|$|A recent {{innovation}} in <b>hay</b> <b>storage</b> {{has been the}} development of the silage or haylage bale, which is a high-moisture bale wrapped in plastic film. These are baled much wetter than hay bales, and are usually smaller than hay bales because the greater moisture content makes them heavier and harder to handle. These bales begin to ferment almost immediately, and the metal bale spear stabbed into the core becomes very warm to the touch from the fermentation process.|$|E

50|$|The core of {{the farm}} {{property}} was purchased by Henry Duncan in 1904, with a potato house and small barn (both no longer extant) standing on it, indicating {{it had already been}} partly cleared and cultivated. Needing a larger barn to provide <b>storage</b> for <b>hay</b> and feed for his workhorses, Duncan built the large barn in 1910. The family typically planted 50 acre in potatoes, another 50 in hay and oats, and left the remaining land fallow. They kept cows and chickens for personal use (the latter in a shed built {{off the side of the}} barn, which has since been removed). The type of barn Duncan built fell into decline with the advent of mechanized agriculture, for which the large <b>hay</b> and feed <b>storage</b> areas were not needed. Beecher Duncan, who succeeded to the farm after his father's death in 1915, acquired a gasoline-powered tractor in 1944, sold off his workhorses, and removed stalls housing them from the barn.|$|R
30|$|Grass {{production}} for <b>storage</b> as <b>hay</b> {{requires a lot}} of care from harvest handling which may determine the quality after storage to feeding. Crude protein (CP) has been used widely as proxy for feed quality analysis and has been reported to decline depending on post harvest handling. The same nutrient has been reported to be among the most limiting in the drylands especially during the dry seasons. Mechanisms of handling and storage to reduce its decline in forage during handling are imperative. The measurement of this vital nutrient that is most limiting in hay was therefore picked in this study and was measured from different curing methods and storage periods. We therefore evaluated the effect of stage of maturity (mature flowering at 12 -week phonological stage) and duration of curing before storage for periods of 2, 12, 24, and 36  weeks on the quality of hay. The selected grass species in were C. roxburghiana (CR), E. superb (ES), E. macrostachyus (EM), C. ciliaris (CC), C. gayana (CG), and S. sudanense (SB). The six were selected from their ranking as best species for hay and reseeding in Rangelands. This study aimed to provide vital information on hay handling from harvest to storage in Kenyan rangelands for quality preservation of pastures that has high demand during the dry seasons. The study sort to answer our hypothesis that <b>hay</b> curing and <b>storage</b> affects the quality of the end product in the Kenyan rangelands.|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on mycotoxins and mycotoxicoses is reviewed. It is stressed that strict {{proof of a}} mycotoxicosis depends on isolation of the toxin, proof {{that it is a}} fungal metabolite, and proof that it occurs in the feedstuffs in sufficient concentrations to cause the disease syndrome. The rational control of mycotoxicosis depends on a greater understanding of the ecology and physiology of toxigenic fungi in stored feedstuffs. The experimental studies are based on a holistic approach to establish the mycoflora of pasture hay and progress to a reductionist study of the effects of temperature and osmotic pressure on fungi isolated from hay. A critical assessment of some isolation techniques has demonstrated their inherent limitations and the need for a variety of isolation techniques to adequately characterize the mycoflora of pasture hay. A broad survey of the mycoflora of baled <b>hay</b> under natural <b>storage</b> conditions has established the variation in the mycoflora in space and time. The distribution of fungi was related to three principal components of the ecosystem of stored hay; namely temperature, osmotic pressure and time. Laboratory storage studies have shown a succession of fungi and other micro-organisms during the moist <b>storage</b> of <b>hay</b> by using both cultural techniques and direct observation with cellophane squares. Autecological studies on the fungi in hay have concentrated on the factors of temperature and osmotic pressure. An interaction between osmotic pressure and temperature was found such that at higher temperatures some fungi were able to grow on media with higher osmotic pressure.
