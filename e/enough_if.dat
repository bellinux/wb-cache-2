5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black <b>enough.</b> <b>If</b> you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E
25|$|The {{selection}} {{for the proper}} solvent {{is based on the}} identification of the adhesive itself. Every adhesive has a particular solvent that work best to break down its chemical composition. Color, hardness, and other physical properties will allow for identification of the adhesive. The adhesive can be soften once exposed, either in a liquid of vapor form, of the solvent for some time. The length of time depends on the solubility of the adhesive and the thickness of the joint. Porous bodies, low-fired clays, are sometimes pre-soaked in water to prevent the adhesive from being drawn back into the body once it joins with the removal solution. If the adhesive that is being removed is part of the support for the object, then supports, such as tissue paper or propping up the object, will be used to make sure the object does not sustain damages once the adhesive is removed. Sometimes if the adhesive is not softened <b>enough</b> <b>if</b> will remove part of the surface on the ceramic if pressure is applied. The information on solvents for specific adhesives are found below, under each adhesive section.|$|E
25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. We all know scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad <b>enough</b> <b>if</b> we {{have to put up with}} these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E

500|$|Participants of {{the rally}} in Austin {{wanted to use}} [...] "Not My Presidents Day" [...] to educate others and hoped that more people would get {{involved}} with expressing their political opinions.

500|$|In contrast, {{the film}} {{gathered}} positive reviews from top critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times enjoyed {{the film and}} gave it {{three out of four}} stars, stating that [...] "Final Destination will no doubt be a hit and inspire the obligatory sequels. Like the original Scream, this movie is too good {{to be the end of}} the road. I have visions of my own". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the film, saying [...] " [...] was playful and energized enough to keep an audience guessing". Joe Leydon of Variety praised the film, saying [...] " [...] generates a respectable amount of suspense and takes a few unexpected turns while covering familiar territory", while Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said it was [...] "a terrific theatrical feature debut for television veterans Glen Morgan and James Wong". Chris Kaltenbach of The Baltimore Sun found the film [...] "fitfully thrilling", while Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide defined the film as [...] "serviceable <b>enough,</b> <b>if</b> you come to it with sufficiently modest expectations".|$|E
500|$|In English law, {{an assault}} means {{to act in}} such a way that the {{claimant}} or victim apprehends the application of immediate unlawful force upon themselves. The key elements of the tort are therefore that the defendant acts, and does so {{in such a way}} that the claimant is put in fear of [...] "immediate physical violence". There is no requirement that actual damage be caused. In R v Costanza, the courts held that threats made by a stalker could be assault, while in R v Ireland, the House of Lords said that in the right situation (specifically, harassing phone calls) silence could be enough. In some situations an act which would otherwise be assault can be mitigated by the language used. In Tuberville v Savage, the defendant reached for his sword and told the claimant that [...] "if it were not [...] time, I would not take such language from you"; it was held that despite the threatening gesture, this meant the claimant was not in immediate danger. The actions must give the claimant reasonable expectation that the defendant is going to use violence; if a fist was raised in front of the claimant, it could be <b>enough.</b> <b>If</b> the fist was raised from inside a police van following arrest, it would not.|$|E

500|$|Mother 3 {{retains the}} turn-based battle system {{featured}} in EarthBound. When the player comes {{into contact with}} an enemy in the overworld, the game transitions to a battle screen. Battles are viewed from a first-person perspective, showing the enemies against a distorted, animated background. The player can assign each character in their party to perform an action, such as attacking an enemy or using items to restore HP or PP. Some characters can utilize psychic-based abilities referred to as PSI, which includes stronger attacks and healing abilities, and require PP to execute. Like EarthBound, combat uses a [...] "rolling health" [...] system: {{when one of the}} player's characters is injured, its HP will gradually [...] "roll" [...] down, similar to an odometer, rather than immediately decremented. This allows a mortally wounded character to perform actions like attacking or healing themselves, as long as the player acts quickly <b>enough.</b> <b>If</b> a character loses all HP, it will become unconscious and cannot participate unless revived by another character. The player loses a battle if all characters become unconscious; the player will then be given the option to continue play from the nearest save point, but with half the DP on their person.|$|E
500|$|Although the Sunday Post was ended {{because of}} {{financial}} losses, the McNeery columns {{were moved to}} the Saturday edition because of their popularity. [...] This local fame came with some annoyance to McNeery's real-life analogue, McGarry, who found himself called McNeery, and even stared at by a Swedish immigrant, a nationality held by Chicago Irish in disdain. One afternoon, when Dunne was in McGarry's tavern, the journalist found him uncommunicative, until his sudden explosion, [...] "You can't put printer's ink on me with impunity," [...] announcing {{that he intended to}} see Dunne's publisher, John R. Walsh. According to Grace Eckley in her volume on Dunne's works, the political positions McNeery was made to espouse were contrary to those of some of McGarry's customers, placing him in an uncomfortable position. The following day, Walsh asked Dunne to change the name, but the writer decided this would not be <b>enough</b> <b>if</b> the fictional saloon was kept as is; instead a humbler establishment (and bartender) in some remoter part of Chicago seemed called for. McKenna, unlike McGarry, was enjoying the attention, and, hearing of the problem, took Dunne to his heavily Irish neighborhood of Bridgeport, introducing him to locals there. Moving the venue to Bridgeport had advantages. A [...] "shanty Irish" [...] barkeeper could be permitted greater freedom of expression than McNeery, for to more urbane Chicagoans, Bridgeporters were unsophisticated, humorous hicks. As Dunne later put it, [...] "while it might be dangerous to call an alderman a thief in English no one could sue if a comic Irishman denounced the statesman as a thief". McGarry's heavy brogue featured in McNeery's speech, and was retained in the move to Bridgeport.|$|E
500|$|In {{her earlier}} episodes, {{producers}} {{set up a}} rivalry between Babe and her brother-in-law Stan Carter, portrayed by Timothy West. The reason for their shared hatred was not explained until Sylvie arrived, when {{it was revealed that}} Babe was in love with Stan and believed Sylvie stole Stan when they were younger. Vicky Prior of the Metro described that there is [...] "no love lost" [...] between Babe and Stan, and speculated that Babe and Stan may have had an affair. Katy Brent-Stacey of the Daily Mirror said Babe's life was [...] "wasted" [...] because she spent it [...] "hoping that Stan would notice her". Miller (Daily Express) described Babe as being [...] "madly in love" [...] with Stan. All About Soap said that [...] "all those years of unrequited love [...] made Babe pretty bitter". Shelley (Daily Mail) was critical of Babe's feelings for Stan, writing, [...] " [...] only made worse by the scriptwriters' occasional, predictable, attempts at trying to evoke viewers' sympathy over her lovelorn feelings for her sister's husband Stan." [...] When Stan is diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer, Babe is [...] "devastated" [...] at the prospect of losing him. Stan becomes engaged to Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell) and when his health deteriorates, they decide to marry quickly. Babe attempts to ruin it by bringing Sylvie to see Stan, but they decide to marry nevertheless. Babe is delighted when Stan is physically unable to say his vows, but is devastated when he dies. Gary Gillatt of Inside Soap expressed his approval of Babe's rivalry with Cora and said, [...] "there's a hot new rivalry in Walford – and we can't get <b>enough</b> <b>if</b> it!" ...|$|E

2500|$|In August 2007, the American Cancer Society {{dedicated}} $15 {{million to}} a public awareness campaign on inadequate access to healthcare for the 47 million Americans not covered by insurance.

The society noted that studies had shown that patients without insurance were more than twice as likely to have their cancer diagnosed in the late stages of the disease.

In markets {{where there were no}} VHF stations and UHF was the only TV service available, UHF survived. In other markets, which were too small to financially support a television station, too close to VHF outlets in nearby cities, or where UHF was forced to compete with more than one well-established VHF station, UHF had little chance for success.|$|E

[...] His energy levels were very low {{and he did not}} leave his house for two months: [...] "I couldn't deal with more than {{one person at a time}} or with multitasking and I cried easily."

2500|$|Mr. Max Harris {{and other}} Angry Penguins writers {{represent}} an Australian outcrop {{of a literary}} fashion which has become prominent in England and America. The distinctive feature of the fashion, it seemed to us, was that it rendered its devotees insensible of absurdity and incapable of ordinary discrimination. Our feeling was that by processes of critical self-delusion and mutual admiration, the perpetrators of this humourless nonsense had managed to pass it off on would-be intellectuals and Bohemians, both here and abroad, as great poetry. [...] However, {{it was possible that}} we had simply failed to penetrate to the inward substance of these productions. The only way of settling the matter was by way of experiment. It was, after all, fair <b>enough.</b> <b>If</b> Mr Harris proved to have sufficient discrimination to reject the poems, then the tables would have been turned.|$|E
2500|$|Development of radar greatly {{expanded}} on 1 September 1936 when Watson-Watt became Superintendent {{of a new}} establishment under the British Air Ministry, Bawdsey Research Station located in Bawdsey Manor, near Felixstowe, Suffolk. Work there resulted {{in the design and}} installation of aircraft detection and tracking stations called [...] "Chain Home" [...] along the East and South coasts of England in time for the outbreak of World War II in 1939. This system provided the vital advance information that helped the Royal Air Force win the Battle of Britain; without it, significant numbers of fighter aircraft would always need to be in the air to respond quickly <b>enough</b> <b>if</b> enemy aircraft detection relied solely on the observations of ground-based individuals.
