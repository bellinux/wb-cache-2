40|$|The Pioneer {{thrust fault}} was {{previously}} proposed {{to be the}} continuous trace of a single, low-angle, Cretaceous thrust fault. The Pioneer thrust fault is mapped wherever the Ordovician Phi Kappa, Silurian Trail Creek, or Devonian Milligen formations are in fault contact above the Mississippian Copper Basin Group. Geologic mapping and structural analysis of the Pioneer thrust fault in the Pioneer Mountains of south-central Idaho indicate that the mapped fault trace north of the Pioneer metamorphic core complex {{is not a single}} Cretaceous fault but a thrust fault offset by an assortment of normal faults. New mapping confirms the presence of the Pioneer thrust fault only in the drainages of Big and Little Fall creeks. The fault north of the Pioneer metamorphic core complex has many significant changes in strike and dip over its map trace. The fault as exposed in Little Fall Creek is typical of the unusual geometry. The Pioneer thrust fault in Little Fall Creek is truncated on the north and south by a series of northeast striking normal faults. Structure contour lines and stereo graphic analysis of the two types of faults differentiate between the northwest striking Pioneer thrust fault and the northeast striking normal faults. The Pioneer thrust fault shows evidence of at least two phases of motion. The earliest phase of motion is recorded by folds in the hangingwall and footwall which verge to the northeast, an accepted direction for thrust faulting associated with regional compression during the Mesozoic Sevier orogeny. At other locations, the Pioneer thrust fault geometry and last recorded sense of motion are consistent with northwest-directed low-angle, oblique-slip motion, which is similar to other low-angle normal faults in the Pioneer Mountains. This direction is associated with Eocene extension. Evidence of this most recent motion is preseved by slickenlines in several locations on the fault surface. M-pole, M-plane analysis yields principal compressive stress axes that are incompatible with the formation of a low-angle oblique-slip <b>fault,</b> <b>reinforcing</b> the possibility of re-activation. Therefore it is suggested that the Pioneer thrust fault be renamed the Pioneer fault system to more accurately reflect its complex motion history. The age of normal faulting in Big and Little Fall creeks is constrained by local and regional cross-cutting relationships. Based on the ages of regional extension, the Pioneer fault extensional re-activation may have occurred during either the late Early Eocene to earliest Middle Eocene (51 to 48 Ma) if it is similar to the Lake Creek and Trail Creek faults, or the early Middle Eocene (48 to 44 Ma) interval if motion is related to the low- angle normal fault in Big Fall Creek. The low angle normal fault in Little Fall Creek cuts the Summit Creek Stock (48 Ma, Silverburg, 1990 a), indicating a post early Middle Eocene age of motion. Other normal faults in Little Fall Creek, interpreted as similar in age, also cut the Pioneer thrust fault. South of the Pioneer metamorphic core complex, the White Mountains fault, a fault interpreted as the same age as the normal faults of Little Fall Creek, cuts the Oligocene (33 Ma) low angle Wildhorse detachment fault. The age of normal faulting in Little Fall Creek is constrained to post early Middle Eocene (48 Ma), and pre-Quaternary (1. 6 Ma). Total displacement accommodated by the Pioneer thrust fault, either as a Cretaceous thrust fault or re-activated Eocene oblique-slip fault is unknown. There are no known pin-points to aid in reconstruction across the thrust fault. Estimations based on similar faults nearby would range from one hundred to several hundred meters...|$|E
500|$|Prior to the 1999 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} in Nantou County, Taiwan, little information {{was available for}} estimating ground motion that resulted from large (greater than M7) thrust earthquakes, and whether the values seen in that event are commonplace remains unresolved. Foam rubber modeling, numerical modeling, and field {{studies have shown that}} intense ground motions close to 1g are possible on the [...] hanging wall side of the fault during some large thrust earthquakes. A common occurrence of shattered rock that has been observed on the hanging wall of thrust <b>faults</b> <b>reinforces</b> the existence of the strong motions, but precarious rock surveys have indicated that smaller ground motions are present on the foot wall side of the fault. Foam rubber modelling studies confirm that the ground motion on the foot wall side can be lower by a factor of up to five, and an example of this imbalance was displayed during the September 1999 M7.6 {{earthquake in}} Taiwan.|$|R
40|$|A {{structural}} analysis {{was carried out}} across on a transect of {{the eastern part of}} the Mogul fault along the Charlouleau Gap Road, located in southern Pinal County, Arizona, to examine how the increased presence of the Pinal Schist along the eastern segment of the exposed fault influenced the faulting along this section. Changes in foliation orientation within the Pinal Schist were observed and measured. The data base evaluated included hundreds of foliation orientation measurements taken and reported by Jinks (1961) in his University of Arizona M. S. thesis. The two sets of observations and orientations revealed that the orientations of the foliation within the Pinal Schist are notably different within the eastern segment of the fault versus the western. It was also found that a section of mylonitized Oracle Granite and highly sheared Pinal Schist crop out on the eastern segment of the fault, contrary to past observations that such mylonitic fabrics were exclusively found within the western segment of the fault. The overall geometry of ‘dragged and rotated foliations in the Pinal Schist in the eastern segment of the Mogul <b>fault</b> <b>reinforces</b> Jinks'(1961) interpretation that the kinematic history of this shear zone included left handed shear...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Fault {{diagnosis}} {{plays an}} important role in physical failure analysis and yield learning process. With tens of billions of transistors being integrated in one chip, multiple faults may exist. With multiple faults, <b>fault</b> masking and <b>reinforcing</b> effects may appear. They may cause the conventional single-fault-based diagnosis methods such as the single location at a time (SLAT) to be invalid. The popular SLAT approach fails if there are not enough SLAT patterns that can be explained by a single stuck-at fault. Moreover, a real silicon defect may behave as different fault models (DM) under different failing patterns, which may invalidate the SLAT approach that uses a single-fault model across all failing patterns. In this paper, we introduce the concept of fault element to support multiple fault models, and use a fault-element graph (FEG) to consider <b>fault</b> masking and <b>reinforcing</b> effects among multiple faults. Based on the FEGs of all failing patterns, the most likely fault locations and their fault elements are iteratively identified. Meanwhile, the FEGs are iteratively pruned to keep track of the remaining multiple fault effects until all the fault locations are identified and all the FEGs are reduced to null. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed diagnosis method can identify the locations of multiple faults even under DM with high diagnostic accuracy and resolution.

40|$|The 24 / 580 / 980 {{interchange}} {{is located}} near Oakland California on the Eastern {{perimeter of the}} San Francisco Bay (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). This interchange is a major artery in the Eastern San Francisco Bay area and provides a critical link between major bay area highways. The main Concord line of the Bay Area Rapid Transit System (BART), with ridership of approximately 270, 000 per day, runs underneath the interchange. The interchange site is approximately 4 Km from the Hayward fault and 16 Km from the San Andreas <b>fault.</b> The <b>reinforced</b> concrete interchange was designed and constructed in the mid 1960 `s and thus the asphalt structure has many of the vulnerabilities associated with typical pre- 1970 `s concrete structures (Roberts [1], Zefinski [2], Chai et. al. [3], Priestly and Seible [4]). In 1980 some of the seismic vulnerabilities were addressed as the interchange was retrofit with deck hinge restrainers {{as part of the}} California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) state-wide seismic retrofit of bridge expansion joints. The interchange was subjected to earthquake motion during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and sustained minor damage in some of the concrete diaphragms which support the hinge restrainer forces [5]. Caltrans engineers, working together with their external consultants Imbsen and Associates, have recently completed a seismic retrofit design for portions of the interchange. The retrofit is primarily intended to fix inadequacies in many of the 1960 `s vintage reinforced concrete elements which constitute the bridge superstructure and foundations...|$|R
40|$|The Cristo lagoon, {{situated}} on Neogene deposits {{in the northern}} Spanish Meseta, occupies a shallow depression on a Pleistocene piedmont. The development of the lacustrine depression on the piedmont was favoured by the <b>fault</b> network, <b>reinforced</b> by substrateloss by weathering, probably during the late Quaternary. Even during the hot summer season, salinity is low, with concentrations of total dissolved solids (TDS) being around 150 mg L – 1. Only when the lagoon is almost dry do TDS concentrations exceed 500 mg L – 1, sometimes rising as high as 1700 mg L – 1. Whenthe lake level is high, lake chemistry is dominated by Na +, Ca 2 +, HCO 3 – and Cl –. During drier stages, there is a relative increase in Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl –, and SO 4 2 –, trending toward a calcium chloride-sulphate brine. Values of pH are above 9 during late spring and summer, resulting primarily from evaporative degassing favoured by the shallow depth of water, and secondarily from photosynthesis by the abundant submerged macrophytes. The infilling deposits, less than 0. 5 m thick, are dark brown, massive, sandy muds consisting of quartz and clays (illite, kaolinite, smectite), {{all of which are}} allogenic in origin. The main source of dissolved sulphate was the oxidation of sulphides during weathering of lower Palaeozoic rocks in the catchment area. The  13 C-depleted nature of dissolved inorganic carbon indicates an origin mostly by respiration and oxidation of organic matter. Geomorphology and hydrogeochemistry indicate a flow-through lake dominated essentially by groundwater flows.  </p...|$|R
40|$|The Neoproterozoic outcrop belt of the Death Valley region, California, {{preserves}} {{an oblique}} {{cross section of}} the Noonday Formation, a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform that hosts distinctive basal Ediacaran cap carbonate−affiliated sedimentary structures, stromatolite textures, and δ^(13) C_(carb) values. The Noonday platform encompasses two depositional sequences that reveal two cycles of relative sea-level change within strata conventionally considered to record a single, rapid, postglacial sea-level rise. In updip localities, facies of the first depositional sequence record the transition from a carbonate ramp to a stromatolite-bearing, “tubestone”-textured, reef-rimmed platform; downdip, localities seaward of the reefal escarpment variably preserve a thin and condensed onlapping foreslope wedge. Base-level fall exposed the reef crest to karstic dissolution and propagated submarine incised valleys into the seaward margin of the reef. Overlying strata record the backfilling of a submarine incised valley and reestablishment of a back-stepping, carbonate-dominated ramp prior to a second subaerial exposure event that defines the contact between the Noonday and Johnnie formations. We address the relative contributions of syndepositional tectonism and recovery from low-latitude deglaciation in dictating Noonday platform architecture and the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary. Noonday Formation deposition coincided with extension of the Laurentian margin during disaggregation of the Rodinian supercontinent. Within this framework, previous work has suggested that the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary records growth <b>faulting</b> that <b>reinforced</b> differential topography, uplifting reef-rimmed horsts—exposing the reef crest to karstic dissolution—and downdropping grabens. However, we trace the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary seaward of the reef crest and demonstrate that, for a time, wave base was situated downdip of the reef escarpment on putatively downdropped fault blocks. Thus, if the Noonday margin were undergoing extension, then the creation of the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary required a concomitant decrease in accommodation due, perhaps, to postglacial isostatic uplift attendant with low-latitude deglaciation. We speculate that Noonday Formation sequence architecture records (1) immediate deglacial flooding, (2) shoaling and exposure due to isostatic rebound induced by either a hiatus in meltwater flux or rapid ice-sheet collapse against a background of global deglaciation, and (3) resumed flooding following complete deglaciation. As rift-related tectonism could amplify or counter glacial isostasy, inferences of the amplitude of local postglacial sea-level change will require robust estimates of syndepositional extension across the Noonday margin...|$|R
40|$|Use {{of expert}} systems for Engineering {{applications}} {{is still in}} very primitive stages in Sri Lanka. However it is being used satisfactorily in many developed countries over several areas of the Engineering applications. In Medical diagnostic applications it had been used successfully over many decades. Later it has been spreaded over some other disciplines such as Engineering fault diagnosis and selecting bad ones from production lines etc. Further {{it has been reported}} that attempts are being done to carry out Engineering designs. Algorithmic methods are still prevalent in structural Engineering designs and these are mainly data driven and non-availability of any single data will stop the running of design process. Expert systems are knowledge driven and non-availability of piece of knowledge will not stop the process. Rule based expert system approach is very popular among the system builders due to its flexibility in applications. In this assignment rule based method was utilized in the process of developing a proto type computer model "BUILD GUIDE" on the design guidelines for domestic buildings, operating in the DOS environment. Chapter I of this report is dealing with the background details of the study including objectives of the study and methodology used and aspects of the Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems. Chapter 2 of this report is on the literature review of the Expert systems and various aspects of them including structure of them, advantages, disadvantages, uncertainty of data and reasoning and methods of developing expert systems etc. Chapter 3 of this report is reserved to discuss about the structuring of design guidelines for domestic buildings, usefulness of design guidelines of domestic buildings and related topics. For this purpose the design entity was considered in three basic stages namely, preliminary design, outline or conceptual design and detailed design stages. Further a description about the expert system development software is available. An output of a sample session for a small domestic building is included in the chapter 3. 5 to illustrate about the output report of the BUILD GUIDE system. Finally a comprehensive comparison of design and diagnosis processes is provided, as it is necessary to understand it clearly before developing an expert system on design and diagnosis. The "CONFAULT" system, which has been formulated to diagnose the <b>faults</b> of <b>Reinforced</b> Concrete structures by identifying sub fault types, is used with the BUILD GUIDE system for the comparison. Further, this report consists with a chapter on brief description of the expert systems for design applications...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the nature of marriage and the expectations of husbands and wives in nineteenth century America by analyzing trial reports of famous nineteenth century divorce cases. The article argues that the textured history of divorce law in the United States shows how the law has affected gendered marital roles through its regulation of divorce. While fault {{is no longer the}} focus of divorce, conformity with gendered expectations remains a central aspect of the marital dissolution legal process. In the nineteenth century, conformity benefitted women; if they were the innocent spouse who had taken care of the children, the household, and their husbands, then they were protected in divorce proceedings. Nineteenth century ideology strongly supported this gendered role of both women and wives, and there was a significant overlap between gendered and marital roles. By the late twentieth century, those very same actions of gender conformity had very different consequences. In the nineteenth century, a woman 2 ̆ 7 s highest calling was to act as a wife; this is no longer true. Late twentieth century wives who try to live the same lives as their nineteenth century counterparts are penalized. While gender roles and expectations, together with domestic relations laws, are changing, the realities of most women 2 ̆ 7 s lives do not yet accord with these changes. Instead, the social norms for marital roles diverge from the legal norms embodied by divorce law. Examining nineteenth century divorce illustrates the confining nature of these congruent legal and social norms, but also illustrates how contemporary divorce law has become separated from these norms. Although divorce law should not return to <b>fault</b> or to <b>reinforcing</b> confining gender roles, it should respect the diverse roles of men and women within marriage. This examination of nineteenth century divorce shows the relationship between gender roles and domestic relations law, but also shows how social norms and legal norms can reinforce, or conflict, with each other...|$|R
