These coatings are UV-cured urethane acrylate composite or polyimide materials {{applied to the}} outside of the fiber during the <b>drawing</b> <b>process.</b> The coatings protect the very delicate strands of glass fiber—about the size of a human hair—and allow it to survive the rigors of manufacturing, proof testing, cabling and installation.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the surface}} tension, the shape is {{smoothed}} during the <b>drawing</b> <b>process,</b> and {{the shape of the}} resulting fiber does not reproduce the sharp edges of the preform. Nevertheless, careful polishing of the preform is important, since any defects of the preform surface affect the optical and mechanical properties of the resulting fiber. In particular, the preform for the test-fiber shown in the figure was not polished well, and cracks are seen with the confocal optical microscope.|$|E

The portrait, along with videos detailing the <b>drawing</b> <b>process,</b> went viral on social media. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's wife Ho Ching shared it on Facebook. Days after Lee died, 16-year-old blogger Amos Yee released a video, Lee Kuan Yew is Finally Dead!, which criticised Lee and compared him to Jesus Christ, insulting both their followers. Yee also posted on his blog a stick-figure cartoon depicting Lee having sex with Margaret Thatcher, a personal and political ally of Lee's. For his actions, Yee was respectively charged with insulting religious feelings and obscenity and sentenced to four weeks imprisonment despite his youth.|$|E

2500|$|The wire <b>drawing</b> <b>process</b> {{is quite}} simple in concept. The wire is {{prepared}} by shrinking {{the beginning of}} it, by hammering, filing, rolling or swaging, {{so that it will}} fit through the die; the wire is then pulled through the die. As the wire is pulled through the die, its volume remains the same, so as the diameter decreases, the length increases. Usually the wire will require more than one draw, through successively smaller dies, to reach the desired size. The American wire gauge scale is based on this. This can be done on a small scale with a draw plate, or on a large commercial scale using automated machinery. [...] The process of wire drawing changes material properties due to cold working.|$|E
2500|$|These are two {{different}} approaches to the actual <b>drawing</b> <b>process.</b> [...] "Straight ahead action" [...] means drawing out a scene frame by frame from beginning to end, while [...] "pose to pose" [...] involves starting with drawing a few key frames, and then filling in the intervals later. [...] "Straight ahead action" [...] creates a more fluid, dynamic illusion of movement, and is better for producing realistic action sequences. On the other hand, {{it is hard to}} maintain proportions, and to create exact, convincing poses along the way. [...] "Pose to pose" [...] works better for dramatic or emotional scenes, where composition and relation to the surroundings are of greater importance. A combination of the two techniques is often used.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "calotype", or [...] "talbotype", was a [...] "developing out" [...] process, Talbot's {{improvement}} {{of his earlier}} photogenic <b>drawing</b> <b>process</b> {{by the use of}} a different silver salt (silver iodide instead of silver chloride) and a developing agent (gallic acid and silver nitrate) to bring out an invisibly slight [...] "latent" [...] image on the exposed paper. This reduced the required exposure time in the camera to only a minute or two for subjects in bright sunlight. The translucent calotype negative made it possible to produce as many positive prints as desired by simple contact printing, whereas the daguerreotype was an opaque direct positive that could only be reproduced by copying it with a camera. On the other hand, the calotype, despite waxing of the negative to make the image clearer, still was not pin-sharp like the metallic daguerreotype, because the paper fibres degraded the printed image. The simpler salted paper process was normally used when making prints from calotype negatives.|$|E

As an example, the original eight-stage deep forming process for a copper cylindrical cup with a high aspect ratio was analyzed by finite element simulation. Microridge punch designs were introduced in Stages 4 and 7 to replace the original punches. In addition, Stages 3 and 6 were eliminated. Finally, these changes were verified through experiments. The results showed that the microridge punches reduced the number of deep drawing stages yielding similar thickness difference percentages. Further, the numerical and experimental results demonstrated good consistency in the thickness distribution.|$|R

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop a mathematical model of cementite and ferrite deformation during <b>drawing</b> <b>processes</b> and receive an information about transformation of a pearlitic structure of wire during drawing. Design/methodology/approach: The wire <b>drawing</b> <b>processes</b> was investigated in two levels - using the 2 -dimensional rigid-plastic finite element method (macro-level) and modelling of a microstructure change (micro-level). In micro-level the process of deformation of representative volume element (RVE) is considered. The pearlitic colony deformation and stress-strain state in RVE is modelled with help of the FEM. Research limitations/implications: The {{influence of}} initial cementite lamellas orientation on triaxity factor and localization of deformation in micro-level is investigated. The numerical simulation is shown a maximal non-uniform deformation of pearlite phases for the canting positions of the cementite lamellas relative the drawing direction. Practical implications: The results of article will be helpful for a fundamental understanding of pearlitic deformation during development of high strength steel wires for tire cord applications. Originality/value: A new model of two-phase grain deformation for wire drawing is proposed. The new conception of simulation of the boundary conditions for the RVE is based on the penalty method and uses a solution of the problem on macro-level...|$|R
