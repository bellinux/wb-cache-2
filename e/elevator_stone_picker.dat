50|$|A <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> (or rock picker) is an {{implement}} to sieve {{through the top}} layer of soil to separate and collect rocks and soil debris from good topsoil. It is usually tractor-pulled. A <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> is similar in function to a rock windrower (rock rake); a <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> generally digs to greater depths to remove stones and rocks.|$|R
50|$|A <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> has digging teeth, a {{conveyor}} system, a sieve or screen, and a stone bin. The digging teeth {{are at the}} leading edge of the <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> and removes soil, which is placed on the conveyor system. If the sieve is not combined with the conveyor system, the conveyor system transports the stones and large rocks to a bin or hopper for periodic dumping. Some <b>stone</b> <b>pickers</b> use a large tractor, generally over 100 horsepower, equipped with hydraulics and power take-off driven mechanisms. PTO pump driven equipment can use 60 horsepower tractors. The tractor's hydraulics control the depth to which the <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> digs to excavate soil material; whereas, the PTO controls the movement of the conveyor and picking system.|$|R

50|$|<b>Stone</b> <b>pickers</b> {{are used}} in farming and landscaping, where stones need {{to be removed from}} the soil and ground surface to prevent damage to other farm {{machinery}} (such as hay balers, combines, and mowers), improve the soil for crop production, or improve the appearance of the ground surface in preparation for a lawn or a golf course. Surface stones and large rocks often left from plowing can damage a hay bailer, the header or reciprocating knives on a combine, and blades on a rotary mower. Land with rock instead of fine soil are often less useful for crops. Thus, removing stones from the soil also ensures a more consistent yield. Additionally, using <b>stone</b> <b>pickers</b> is particularly useful for crops forming tubers (such as potatoes) in the ground.|$|R
50|$|Lee {{tries to}} {{sabotage}} {{the last remaining}} mining shuttle, but he is trapped in an <b>elevator</b> by <b>Stone</b> and blown up by his own bomb. The others return safely to Earth, where Stone informs the Galactic Mining Chairman (Roscoe Lee Browne) that Lee was bribed by Pyrite to redirect the mining shuttles to a planet in the Outer Zone.|$|R
40|$|The {{equipment}} (Fig. 1) {{consists of}} a 10 -mm suction-irrigation pipe, Maelecot catheter (no. 30 / 32), and a small plastic contain-er with air-tight cap. The <b>stone</b> <b>picker</b> (Fig. 2) is prepared as fol-lows. With {{the help of the}} hot metal perforator, a small hole of ~ 3 mm (air vent) diameter is made in the cap of the plastic con-tainer. A second hole of ~ 10 mm diameter is made in the side wall. A small length of Maelecot catheter is used to connect the box to the 10 -mm suction-irrigation pipe. The air vent is closed with the right index finger and the system is inserted through the 10 -mm (internal diameter) cannula (Fig. 3). Its tip should be placed near the stone to be extracted. The air vent is opened. As the intra-abdominal pressure (10 – 12 mmHg) is high, there is a gush of air through the cannula which takes the stone out. With this technique, stones less than 10 mm in diameter can be vent-ed out. Larger stones are crushed and then they can be dealt wit...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new scheme {{of a highly}} {{efficient}} line for preparing safflower grains for processing consisting of an air-sieve separator, a magnetic separator, an ovary, a puppet, and a <b>stone</b> <b>picker.</b> The new after vortex separator is a vibroseparator for separating the products close in physical properties, grinding Machine with a duo-aspirator, a photoseparator and a device for moisture-thermal treatment. Advantages of the proposed line for preparation of safflower grain for processing are that an additional plant {{in front of the}} photocarerator of the grinding machine and duo-espirator allows the crest to separate and remove or refine the shell of the seed {{in the form of a}} shell layer for more efficient subsequent spectral point analysis, which determines the grain composition for the purpose of sorting it On the basis of chemical composition and color in the photo separator, and sequential placement after the stone separator of a vibro separator for separation of products close in physical properties, a grinding machine with a duo-aspirator, a photoseparator and a device for moisture-thermal treatment, provides an intensification of the technological process of efficient separation of safflower from impurities and its preparation for further processing and Due to the rational layout of equipment. A highly efficient photocell separator is also provided, the advantages of which are that the installation of a storage and vibrating feeder in relation to the slanting tray from the back side and the execution of a smooth curved transition to the vibrating feeder in the upper part of the pitcher allows improving the separation of grain products by reducing the amplitude of grain oscillations, Caused by a rebound from the surface of the tray during the loading of the sorted material from the vibrating feeder...|$|R
50|$|Maybee {{was named}} for Abram Maybee, who, along with Joseph Klotz, surveyed, platted, and sold the land that became the village between 1873 and 1875. The village was {{incorporated}} in 1899. Spurred on by the railroad, the village grew to include a grain <b>elevator,</b> grist mill, <b>stone</b> quarry, sand pit, hotel, three churches, two schools, and several small factories and stores. It is primarily an agricultural community. The grain elevator and quarry are still operating, along with several small businesses and restaurants.|$|R

50|$|The Dyerville Mill is an {{historic}} textile mill complex at 610 Manton Avenue in Providence, Rhode Island, USA. Its oldest buildings dating to 1835, {{it is one}} the oldest textile mill in the city. The complex is located between Manton Avenue and the Woonasquatucket River, {{just south of the}} Dyerville Mill Pond. Remnants of the head race run south from the pond, through the property, with the tail race exiting to the southwest. The main mill building is a 3-1/2 story L-shaped stuccoed <b>stone</b> structure. The <b>picker</b> house is a 2-1/2 story stone structure southwest of the main mill, with a brick extension that also gives it an L shape and creates a courtyard with the main building. A 20th-century warehouse stands south of this complex. The mill was established by Elisha Dyer, father of Elisha Dyer and grandfather of Elisha Dyer, Jr., and was operated by the Dyer family until 1867. It was then operated by cotton broker Truman Beckwith and his son. The Joslin Manufacturing Company purchased the business in 1903 and operated textile production on the site until the 1930s. The site has thereafter seen other light industrial uses.|$|R
50|$|This {{is where}} Hannah Grant starts her journey of Schizm. Her {{starting}} locations differ between the CD and DVD version. On the CD, she starts {{on a narrow}} catwalk leading up, but on the DVD version, Hannah begins on a wide island with benches and walkways, leading to the catwalk. From what the player can see, it is quite evident that these organic structures form a village for most, if not all, the Argilans. Gazebos, tentacles, <b>elevators,</b> benches, curly <b>stone</b> formations, and plants {{are all over the}} place, and some of the villagers' houses bear things outside of them such as pools of greenish liquid, gourds in boxes (which seem to also grow on the living island walls), pillows and pottery, or bee-like insects swarming around odd, tuber-like structures. (a picture of said insect can be seen in one of their locations) And in the DVD version, an adult version of this insect can be seen sweeping through the player's view with a whooshing sound, and several of them hover in certain areas.|$|R
