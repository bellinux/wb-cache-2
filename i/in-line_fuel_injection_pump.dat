40|$|Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) {{returned}} {{one high}} pressure fuel hose to Engine Systems, Inc. (ESI) because CNS had found foreign material within the hose during receipt inspection. This fuel hose {{was one of four}} fuel hoses that had been supplied to CNS by ESI in October 2011. ESI performed an evaluation and found very small pieces of the elastomer tube internal to the hose. Apparently these pieces were introduced during assembly of the end fittings onto the hose during fabrication of the hose assembly. When installed, this fuel hose would be located after the engine fuel filter and before the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps.</b> Foreign material within this hose could migrate to the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps.</b> The entrance of foreign material could impact operability of one or more <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> and therefore affect fuel delivery to one or more engine cylinders. This could impact the load carrying capability of the diesel engine or possibly cause complete engine shutdown. Either scenario has the potential to prevent the emergency diesel generator from performing its safety related function. These hoses were supplied only to CNS. 02 - 03 - 12; 03 : 43 PM; # 11 /...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the engine}} was cylinder-ported and {{required}} no poppet valves, each bank had a camshaft, driven at crankshaft speed. This was used solely to drive the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps,</b> each cylinder having its own injector and pump, driven by its own cam lobe.|$|R

50|$|The drive {{between the}} {{crankshafts}} was unusual. Rather {{than the typical}} geared drive, as used by the Jumo, there was a triangular coupling rod frame, driven by an overhung crank {{on the end of}} each crankshaft. This frame in turn drove the flywheel and output shaft. The frame also drove the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump,</b> mounted in the top vee between the cylinders.|$|R
25|$|A two-speed, {{two-stage}} supercharger and intercooler {{were used}} to compress then cool the air-fuel mixture, following Griffon and Merlin practice. Starting was by Coffman starter. An auxiliary shaft driven by the lower crankshaft operated the main coolant pump, intercooler coolant pump, pressure and scavenge oil <b>pumps</b> and a <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump.</b> Piston ring failures and cylinder head sealing problems were experienced during early flight testing.|$|R
50|$|Following the Bosch takeover, {{there was}} a series of {{ownership}} changes that resulted in the division of the major business groups: <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps,</b> automotive airconditioners, bus airconditioners and mobile refrigeration units, and the differential and airbag product lines. For example, M.C. Bernardo Inc. (the exclusive representative of Diesel Kiki/Zexel in the Philippines) had to turn over business to Robert Bosch Philippines, like other Zexel partners in other countries and regions.|$|R

50|$|The {{mechanical}} fly-weight {{governors of}} inline and distributor diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> {{used to control}} fuel delivery {{under a variety of}} engine loads and conditions could no longer deal with the ever increasing demands for efficiency, emission control, power and fuel consumption.These demands are now primarily fulfilled by the Electronic Control, the system which provides greater ability for precise measuring, data processing, operating environment flexibility and analysis to ensure efficient diesel engine operation. The EDC replaces the mechanical control governor with an electro-magnetic control device.|$|R
50|$|The Endura-DE engine {{features}} a cast iron block and indirect injection style cylinder head, which {{means there is}} a combustion chamber built into the cylinder head. This engine makes use of aluminium for some other components to minimise the weight penalty of the Diesel engine. It has a single overhead camshaft opening eight valves via shim-and-bucket followers. The camshaft is rotated by a toothed belt driven by a toothed sprocket on the Crankshaft, likewise the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> is rotated by a second toothed belt driven from the crankshaft. The diesel <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> is a rotary distributor type most typically made by Lucas CAV.|$|R

50|$|The {{improved}} powerplant had its stroke lifted by 10 mm {{while the}} bore remained the same. The displacement was lifted to 12.6 litres {{which resulted in}} increased horsepower and torque. For military variants the engines were capable of running on alternative fuels (mixtures of diesel fuel, gasoline and or aviation kerosine fuel), albeit with a performance loss. The air cooling system was retained once again with the cooling fan driven via hydraulic clutch and engine oil temperature controlled. The <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> featured different types variable or combination governors depending on the vehicle application.|$|R
50|$|In 1926 CAV {{was bought}} by Lucas. In 1931, CAV in {{partnership}} with Robert Bosch Ltd., became CAV-Bosch Ltd and began making <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pumps</b> for the diesel industry and later fuel systems for aircraft. Lucas bought Bosch's interest out in 1937 and it became CAV Ltd in 1939. In 1978 the company's name became Lucas CAV. In 1980 the Acton factory employed around 3,000 people making heavy duty electric equipment for commercial vehicles, by this time high volume diesel <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> manufacturing had been relocated to larger modern factories in Kent, Suffolk, Gloucestershire and many countries throughout the world. Acton continued to make low volume specialist pumps for the military and for Gardner engines.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> {{system has}} a {{throttle}} position sensor on the throttle body; O2 sensor {{in the top of}} the exhaust header-pipe; temperature sensor; thermo unit at the upper rear of the cylinder head; and a lean angle sensor to interrupt the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> — should, for example, the bike be on its side. The air filter is a disposable oil-coated paper type held in place by the airbox cover. The electrical system had an automatic cut-out to stop the engine when left idling longer than 20 minutes. The exhaust system has an exhaust pipe coated with a nano-film to prevent discoloration and includes a 3-way honeycomb-type catalytic converter to meet EU and US (50 state) emission requirements.|$|R
5000|$|The 2308 cc L M127.II inline-six engine with [...] and 196 Nm torque {{was based}} on Mercedes-Benz' venerable M180 inline-six with four main {{bearings}} and mechanical Bosch multi-port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> Mercedes-Benz {{made a number of}} modifications to boost its power, including increasing displacement from 2197 cc L, and using a completely new cylinder head with a higher compression ratio (9.3 vs. 8.7), enlarged valves and a modified camshaft. A <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> with six plungers instead of two was fitted, which allowed placing the nozzles in the cylinder head and [...] "shooting" [...] the fuel through the intake manifold and open valves directly into the combustion chambers. An optional oil-water heat exchanger was also available.|$|R
40|$|The inner {{diameter}} of {{high pressure fuel}} pipe has {{a significant effect on}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> process and the performance of a diesel engine. The spray impact force of each nozzle hole of a conventional injection system of pump-line-nozzle for diesel engine (based on the spray momentum flux) and the injection pressure (on a <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> test rig) were measured. With varying <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> quantities and <b>pump</b> speed, the effects of the {{inner diameter}} of the high pressure fuel pipe on <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> process and the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> characteristics of each nozzle hole were analyzed. It was noted from experimental results that the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> pressure changes with variations in the inner diameter of the high pressure fuel pipe and also the injection duration gradually increases with increase in the inner diameter. At low <b>injection</b> <b>pump</b> speed, even with the same geometric fuel deliver rate, the injection duration also increases gradually. Due to throttling effect and reduction in <b>injection</b> pressure, the <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> quantities of the injection nozzle were relatively minimal when the inner diameters of the high pressure fuel pipe were respectively small and large. The optimum injection pipe inner diameter for the right quantity for <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> falls between the two cases (between small and large). In addition, the injection rate of each nozzle hole increases with the decrease in angle between the needle axis and each of the nozzle hole axis. The <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> quantity of each nozzle hole increases while their relative difference decreases with increasing pump speed...|$|R
