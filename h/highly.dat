5|$|Also, {{the paucity}} of {{morphological}} differences between the Old World mallards and the New World mallard demonstrates {{the extent to which}} the genome is shared among them such that birds like the Chinese spot-billed duck are <b>highly</b> similar to the Old World mallard, and birds such as the Hawaiian duck are <b>highly</b> similar to the New World mallard.|$|E

5|$|Hawksbills are <b>highly</b> {{resilient}} and {{resistant to}} their prey. Some of the sponges they eat, such as Aaptos aaptos, Chondrilla nucula, Tethya actinia, Spheciospongia vesparium, and Suberites domuncula, are <b>highly</b> (often lethally) toxic to other organisms. In addition, hawksbills choose sponge species with {{significant numbers of}} siliceous spicules, such as Ancorina, Geodia (G. gibberosa), Ecionemia, and Placospongia.|$|E
5|$|In some {{reactions}} between <b>highly</b> {{reactive metals}} (usually from Group 1 or Group 2) and <b>highly</b> electronegative halogen gases, or water, the atoms can be ionized by electron transfer, a process thermodynamically understood using the Bornâ€“Haber cycle.|$|E

5|$|The {{chronological order}} of the kings from the second kingdom era is <b>highly</b> uncertain; nevertheless, {{it is assumed that}} the letter of Enna-Dagan lists them in a chronological order. Many of the kings were attested through their own votive objects {{discovered}} in the city, and the dates are <b>highly</b> speculative.|$|E
5|$|The cost of free {{allocation}} of units to emitters is a <b>highly</b> contentious subject. The Sustainability Council {{argued that the}} {{allocation of}} units to industry is <b>highly</b> costly to taxpayers.|$|E

5|$|The {{outlines}} of an animal's body {{can be made}} hard to see by other methods, such as by using a <b>highly</b> irregular outline. For example, the comma butterfly, Polygonia c-album, is <b>highly</b> cryptic when its wings are closed, with cryptic colours, disruptive pattern, and irregular outer margins to the wings.|$|E

5|$|Although {{these issues}} with {{censorship}} obscured and truncated the film {{for many years}} following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a <b>highly</b> original and accomplished work. Even more since being restored to its original version, Andrei Rublev {{has come to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} greatest films of all time, and has often been ranked <b>highly</b> in both the Sight & Sound critics' and directors' polls.|$|E

5|$|B.integrifolia is a <b>highly</b> {{variable}} species. It is {{most often}} encountered as a tree up to 25 metres (80ft) in height, but in sheltered locations it can reach 35 metres (110ft). In more exposed areas it may grow as a small, gnarled tree, reaching {{to no more than}} about 5 metres (15ft), and in <b>highly</b> exposed positions, such as on exposed coastal headlands, it may even be reduced to a small shrub.|$|E

5|$|Bulk {{francium}} {{has never}} been viewed. Because of the general appearance of the other elements in its periodic table column, {{it is assumed that}} francium would appear as a <b>highly</b> reactive metal, if enough could be collected together to be viewed as a bulk solid or liquid. Obtaining such a sample is <b>highly</b> improbable, since the extreme heat of decay (the half-life of its longest-lived isotope is only 22 minutes) would immediately vaporize any viewable quantity of the element.|$|E

5|$|Frank Spedding's Ames Project had {{developed}} the Ames process, {{a method of}} producing uranium metal on an industrial scale, but Cyril Stanley Smith, the CM Division's associate leader in charge of metallurgy, was concerned about using it with <b>highly</b> enriched uranium due to the danger of forming a critical mass. <b>Highly</b> enriched uranium was also far more valuable than natural uranium, {{and he wanted to}} avoid the loss of even a milligram. He recruited Richard D. Baker, a chemist who had worked with Spedding, and together they adapted the Ames Process for use at the Los Alamos laboratory. In February Baker and his group made twenty 360 gram reductions and twenty-seven 500 gram reductions with <b>highly</b> enriched uranium tetrafluoride.|$|E
