40|$|The {{growth and}} {{development}} of perennial gentians (Gentiana L.) for cut flowers are seasonally controlled. It was hypothesized that in these plants the availability of carbohydrates is a limiting factor influencing the development of crown buds, winter survival, spring re-growth, and their development to flowering; this in turn influences the yield and quality of flowering shoots. By focussing on the seasonal changes of non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) in various organs, {{and the effect of}} differential carbohydrate supply on their {{growth and development}}, the current thesis aimed to understand the physiological function of NSCs and their potential influence on the commercial production of flowering shoots. In addition to sucrose, fructose and glucose, the unique carbohydrates, <b>gentianose,</b> gentiobiose and L-bornesitol were found in the gentian hybrids investigated. <b>Gentianose</b> was the main storage carbohydrate, accounting for 50 % - 70 % total NSCs in storage roots year round, likely playing similar roles as starch and/or fructan do in other plant species. The concentration of these NSCs in various organs fluctuated with seasonal changes, reflecting periods of storage and utilization of NSCs, i. e. the transition between sink and source, in the growth and development of plants during an annual growth cycle. When harvesting flowering shoots, commercial growers of gentian leave a set number of leaves to maintain carbohydrate levels; however, optimization of leaf number/area has never been assessed in terms of carbohydrate reserves. Utilizing varying levels of defoliation, a positive correlation was determined between the resulting concentration of NSCs in crowns (crown buds, rhizomes and storage roots) and both the number and size of new crown buds, supporting the hypothesis that the availability of carbohydrates is a limiting factor influencing the development of crown buds. Experiments in vitro both verified and extended the level of understanding, indicating that the morphogenesis of crown buds, including form, dormancy, and differentiation, was influenced by multiple factors including, carbohydrates, photoperiod and ethylene. Reserves of NSCs in crowns in autumn were positively correlated with both winter survival and spring re-growth. Consistent with these results, the dynamics of NSC concentration and the activity of relevant glycoside hydrolases (GHs) indicated that a large amount of <b>gentianose,</b> up to 106 mg g- 1 fresh weight (FW) accumulated in storage roots before winter was subsequently hydrolysed and remobilized to the crown buds to impart cold tolerance in winter and be used during their subsequent re-growth in spring. Substantial gentiobiose, up to 38 mg g- 1 FW, accumulated in stem tissue of the shoots before anthesis commenced, while <b>gentianose</b> increased by up to 26 mg g- 1 FW in petals before floret opening. These two forms of carbohydrates were considered likely candidates facilitating the fast development of florets. During the development and senescence of florets, the activity of relevant GHs controlling the hydrolysis of <b>gentianose,</b> gentiobiose, and sucrose, was associated with increase of pressure potential driving the opening of floret buds. The stage-specific and dramatic changes of accumulation, conversion and mobilization of NSCs in association with the activity of relevant enzymes, also provided a useful experimental model system to study the metabolism and physiological function of these unique NSCs in gentians. The current study has provided increased understanding of the roles of specific NSCs, particularly <b>gentianose</b> and gentiobiose, in the growth and development of gentians. The thesis also offers a framework of information to improve the balance between carbohydrate storage in underground crowns and harvest of flowering shoots, and therefore benefits the sustainability of yield and quality of flowering shoots in commercial production...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the wide {{distribution}} of herbal teas the data on nutritional characterisation, chemical profile and biological activity of these products are required. The decoctions of Gentiana algida, G. decumbens, G. macrophylla and G. triflora herb teas were nutritionally characterized with respect to their macronutrients, demonstrating the predominance of polysaccharides and low lipid content. Gentian decoctions were also submitted to a microcolumn RP-HPLC-UV analysis of phytochemicals demonstrating a high content of iridoids (177. 18 – 641. 04 μg/mL) and flavonoids (89. 15 – 405. 71 μg/mL). Additionally, mangiferin was detected in samples of G. triflora tea (19. 89 μg/mL). Five free sugars (fructose, glucose, sucrose, gentiobiose, <b>gentianose)</b> were identified in all gentian teas studied, as well as six organic acids (malic, citric, tartaric, oxalic, succinic, quinic). Pectic polysaccharides with a high content of rhamnogalacturonans and arabinogalactans were also identified and characterized in gentian decoctions for the first time. Gentian tea decoctions and their specific compounds (gentiopicroside, loganic acid- 6 ′-O-β-d-glucoside, isoorientin, isoorientin- 4 ′-O-β-d-glucoside, mangiferin, water-soluble polysaccharides) showed a promising antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potentials.

40|$|A {{invertase}}, enzima encontrada em leveduras, sobretudo na espÃcie Sacharomyces cerevisiae, invertebrados, vertebrados, algas verdes, bactÃrias, vegetais e fungos, Ã uma das principais responsÃveis pela hidrÃlise da sacarose para a formaÃÃo de aÃÃcar invertido e Ã utilizada por indÃstrias alimentÃcias e farmacÃuticas, na hidrÃlise da rafinose, inulina e <b>gentianose.</b> No presente trabalho objetivou-se a purificaÃÃo e caracterizaÃÃo parcial da invertase, obtida por fermentaÃÃo em estado sÃlido. A invertase foi produzida por Aspergillus casiellus utilizando como substrato farelo de soja por um perÃodo de 72 a 220 h, a 25 ÂC. A extraÃÃo das enzimas foi feita utilizando shaker a 120 rpm por um perÃodo de 1 h. O extrato obtido foi filtrado e estocado em freezer. A recuperaÃÃo da enzima invertase foi feita atravÃs de precipitaÃÃo das proteÃnas com solventes orgÃnicos, sulfato de amÃnio e atravÃs de choque tÃrmico. A purificaÃÃo da invertase foi conduzida em coluna de DEAE-celulose. Foram caracterizados atividade enzimÃtica do material fermentado, a estabilidade quanto Ã temperatura e ao pH, temperatura e pH Ãtimos, efeito da presenÃa de Ãons, quelantes, agentes redutores e detergentes, alÃm da determinaÃÃo de carboidratos neutros e especificidade ao substrato. A atividade especÃfica do extrato bruto foi de 1029, 75 apÃs um perÃodo de 72 h de fermentaÃÃo usando o farelo de soja como substrato. A recuperaÃÃo por precipitaÃÃo por sulfato de amÃnio e solventes foi menos eficiente que um choque tÃrmico para a recuperaÃÃo da invertase do extrato bruto. A enzima foi parcialmente purificada atravÃs de precipitaÃÃo por choque tÃrmico (utilizando sobrenadante) e cromatografia de troca aniÃnica em DEAE-celulose com um fator de purificaÃÃo de 30, 30 vezes e rendimento de 42, 70 %. As anÃlises eletroforÃticas estimaram a massa molecular da invertase estudada em torno de 25, 5 kDa. ApÃs ser submetida Ãs etapas de purificaÃÃo, a enzima manteve as condiÃÃes Ãtimas de pH 4, 0 e de temperatura 70 ÂC. ApÃs 24 horas de incubaÃÃo em pH 4, 0, a invertase homogÃnea manteve 50 % de atividade enzimÃtica residual. A invertase demonstrou termoresistÃncia em temperaturas de 60 a 70 ÂC nÃo atingindo o tempo de meia vida em 240 minutos. Nas temperaturas de 75 a 80 ÂC foram mantidas aproximadamente 40 % da atividade residual apÃs 4 horas de incubaÃÃo. A invertase parcialmente purificada nÃo demonstrou a necessidade de Ãons metÃlicos para a ativaÃÃo catalÃtica, mas a presenÃa de Ãons Al 3 + e Cu+ provocaram aumento da atividade, enquanto que Sn 2 + diminuiu a atividade catalÃtica. O conteÃdo de carboidratos corresponde a 36, 57 % da massa total de proteÃna. A invertase do A. casiellus demonstrou ser especificidade Ã sacarose. Para a purificaÃÃo da invertase de Aspergillus casiellus, induzido por farelo de soja, foram necessÃrios 2 passos constituÃdos de colunas cromatogrÃficas de troca-iÃnica DEAE-Celulose, o que torna o processo viÃvel e com tempo despendido em relaÃÃo a outros processos. O uso de resÃduo agroindustrial para obtenÃÃo da invertase torna-se uma ferramenta para o desenvolvimento de tecnologias limpas, convertendo o resÃduo em questÃo em um produto de maior valor agregado. The invertase, enzyme {{found in}} yeast, above {{all in the}} Sacharomyces cerevisiae species, invertebrate, vertebrate, green alga, bacteries, vegetal and fungus, {{is one of the}} principal accountable for sucrose hydrolysis to form the inverted syrup, is used by the food industry and pharmacy, in the hydrolyses of rafinose, inulin and <b>gentianose.</b> In the present work, the invertase was produced by Aspergillus casiellus through solid state fermentation, using the industrial waste of soy bran, during a period of 72 h at 25 ÂC. The enzyme extraction was done by shaking at 120 rpm to period of 1 h. The extract obtained was filtered and stocked in freezer. The enzyme recovery was done throughout the protein precipitation with organic solvents, ammonium sulphate and thermal shock. The invertase purification was carried-out in anion-exchange chromatography DEAE-cellulose. It was characterized the enzyme activity of fermented material, the stability relationship to temperature and pH, optimum temperature and pH, effect of the presence of some ions, chelating, redutors agents and detergents, beyond the neutral carbohydrate content determination and specificity to the substrate. The specific enzyme activity was 1029, 75 U/mg after the period of 72 h of fermentation using soybean bran as substrate. The precipitation with ammonium sulphate and solvents was less efficient than thermal shock for the invertase recovery. The enzyme was purified through thermal shock and anion-exchange chromatography in DEAE-cellulose with a purification factor of 30, 30 fold and a yield of 42, 70 %. The electrophoretic analyses demonstrated that the studied invertase presents molar mass around 25. 5 kDa. After submitted to the purification steps, the enzyme showed optimum pH 4. 0 and temperature 70 ÂC. In relation to the stability, after 24 hours of incubation at pH 4. 0, the invertase maintained 50 % of residual activity. The invertase showed thermalstability at 60 â 70 ÂC not arrive the half-life time in 240 minutes was observed 40 % of the catalytic capacity remained. In temperatures of 75 - 85 ÂC, 40 % of residual activity were maintained after 4 h of incubation. The partially purified invertase didnÂt need metallic ions for catalytic activity, but the presence of Al 3 + and Cu+ improved the activity, and Sn 2 + challenged decrease in the activity. Sugar content corresponded to 36. 57 % of total mass protein. The invertase of A. casiellus demonstrated specificity to sucrose. For purification of the invertase of Aspergillus casiellus, induced through soybean bran, were needed 2 steps made up anion-exchange chromatography DEAE-cellulose, which turn the process practible and with few time despended relationship to the others process.
