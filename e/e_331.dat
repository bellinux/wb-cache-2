Two areas of specific concern are: 1) the bottom corners of windows where damage is most commonly seen, and 2) the area around curved, arched or round-top windows where it is difficult to install the standard flashing materials. This paper reviews performance testing of window flashing installation methods commonly used in the trade, as well as improved methods made possible by recent advancements in flashing products. A series of laboratory tests were designed to determine water resistance, air leakage resistance and durability of several installation methods with different flashing materials. Windows were installed in test wall sections using several methods. The installations were monitored and evaluated for ease of installation and then tested for air leakage and water resistance using ASTM E 283 and ASTM <b>E</b> <b>331.</b> The durability of the installations was then evaluated by subjecting the walls to thermal cycling (0 to 160 oF) and retesting for water resistance using ASTM <b>E</b> <b>331.</b> Recommendations for best practice installation based on the testing results and key material selection issues are presented...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: The {{characteristics}} of P 450 c 17 deficiency include 46,XY disorder of sex development, hypertension, hypokalemia, {{and lack of}} pubertal development. OBJECTIVE: To better understand this rare enzymatic deficiency, we analyzed the CYP 17 A 1 gene in six affected patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: We examined six patients, five 46,XY, and one 46,XX (age 9 - 29 yr) with complete lack of masculinization (female infantile external genitalia, no uterus) and delayed puberty, respectively, and different degrees of hypertension. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Genotype-phenotype correlation was measured. RESULTS: Four homozygote mutations were identified by direct sequencing of the CYP 17 A 1 gene corresponding to an alanin 302 -proline (A 302 P) exchange; the loss of lysine 327 (K 327 del); the deletion of glutamate 331 (<b>E</b> <b>331</b> del); and the replacement of arginine 416 with a histidine (R 416 H). Both P 450 c 17 activities were abolished in all the mutant proteins, except one, when expressed in COS 1 cells. The <b>E</b> <b>331</b> del-mutated P 450 c 17 retained 17 alpha-hydroxylase activity. The mutant proteins were normally expressed, suggesting {{that the loss of}} enzymatic activity is not due to defects of synthesis, stability, or localization of P 450 c 17 proteins. CONCLUSION: These studies confirm lack of masculinization in 46,XY individuals as the pathognomic sign of the complete P 450 c 17 deficiency. In XX individuals P 450 c 17 deficiency should be considered in cases of delayed puberty. Age of onset and the severity of hypertension {{do not seem to be}} constant. Careful examination of long-term follow-ups in two of our patients suggested to us that estrogen treatment in P 450 c 17 -deficient patients might worsen the enzymatic defect, leading to aggravation of the hypertension...|$|E
40|$|The protein {{degradation}} process is of vital {{importance for the}} cell to maintain cellular functions. An important enzyme in this process is the multimeric tripeptidyl-peptidase II (TPP II). It removes tripeptides from a free N-terminus of the substrates. TPP II has broad substrate specificity and wide-spread distribution, suggesting that the TPP II gene is a house-keeping gene. However, the levels of both mRNA and TPP II protein varies during different conditions and the TPP II gene promoter was therefore identified and characterized. It is a 215 bp fragment just upstream of the coding sequence. This fragment lacks a TATA-box but contains an initiator, two inverted CCAAT-boxes and an E-box. The CCAAT-boxes and the E-box were found to bind the nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) and upstream stimulatory factor- 1 (USF- 1) respectively. The CCAAT-boxes appear to be most important for the transcriptional activation. Furthermore, several silencer element were identified further upstream of the 215 bp promoter and the octamer binding factor Oct- 1 was found to bind one of these fragments. If Oct- 1 {{is responsible for the}} inhibition of the transcription of the TPP II gene remains to be investigated. In addition, the substrate specificity was investigated. For this purpose an expression system using Pichia pastoris was developed. The purified recombinant TPP II was found to have the same enzymatic properties as the native enzyme. In order to identify the amino acids involved in the binding of the N-terminus of the substrate, wild-type murine TPP II and four mutants E 305 Q, E 305 K, <b>E</b> <b>331</b> Q and <b>E</b> <b>331</b> K were purified. Steady-state kinetic analysis clearly demonstrated that both Glu- 305 and Glu- 331 are important for this binding as the KMapp is more than 102 higher for the mutants than wild-type.

In contrast to another putative chloride coordinating residue, Ser- 331, where mutation to glutamate led to chloride-independent GABA transport, the Q 291 E mutant was devoid of any transport activity, despite substantial expression at the plasma membrane. Low but significant transport activity was observed with substitution mutants with small side chains such as Q 291 S/A/G. Remarkably, when these mutations were combined with the S <b>331</b> <b>E</b> mutation, transport was increased significantly, even though the activity of the S <b>331</b> <b>E</b> single mutant was only ∼ 25 % of that of wild type GAT- 1.

In addition to the interaction of the transporter with chloride, Gln- 291 is also required at an additional step during transport.

The project has carried out three different trials; i. e. a simulation trial in France, a track test trial in Austria and on-road trial in the United Kingdom in cooperation with local authorities. For the simulation and track test trials, more than 100 test subjects were recruited respectively according to three age groups (20 – 40, 41 – 60 and 61 + years) and took several trials during different conditions.

The project subsequently monitored speed over a whole climatic cycle and undertook an accidentology analysis. The results of the study in general indicate that the presence of enhanced road markings did significantly increase driver comfort, especially for older drivers. While there was an increase in driver speed, it was not seen as safety hazard as it was compensated by greater preview times.

(2) The interaction with nucleic acid enhances the self-assembly for the wild type but triggers quick aggregation for three mutants. (3) A membrane-interacting subdomain has been identified over residues Met 311 -Gln 343 indispensable for TDP- 43 neurotoxicity, which transforms into a well-folded Ω-loop-helix structure in membrane environments. Furthermore, despite having very similar membrane-embedded conformations, three mutants will undergo further self-association in the membrane environment. Our study implies that the TDP- 43 prion-like domain appears to have an energy landscape, which allows the assembly of the wild-type sequence into dynamic oligomers only under very limited condition sets, and ALS-causing point mutations are sufficient to remodel it to more favor the amyloid formation or irreversible aggregation, thus supporting the emerging view that the pathologic aggregation may occur via the exaggeration of functionally important assemblies. Furthermore, the coupled capacity of TDP- 43 in aggregation and membrane interaction may critically account for its high neurotoxicity, and therefore its decoupling may represent a promising therapeutic strategy to treat TDP- 43 causing neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R

The main advantages of the cable-type wall system are that the expense of construction could be reduced due to the simplicity of the construction. The experiment of structural analysis and air/water tightness was performed to evaluate its feasibility of industrialization. The structural performance of the cable-type wall system was evaluated through the structural analysis and the full-scale experiment to predict the initial pre-tension force and the design load displacement of the vertical one-way cable-type wall system {{that can be used for}} a typical floor of the high-rise building.

Here, we used alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the HCN 2 S 4 –S 5 linker to identify three residues, <b>E</b> 324, Y <b>331,</b> and R 339, that when mutated disrupted normal channel closing. Mutation of a basic residue in the S 4 domain (R 318 Q) prevented channel opening, presumably by disrupting S 4 movement. However, channels with R 318 Q and Y 331 S mutations were constitutively open, suggesting that these channels can open without a functioning S 4 domain. We conclude that the S 4 –S 5 linker mediates coupling between voltage sensing and HCN channel activation. Our findings also suggest that opening of HCN and related channels corresponds to activation of a gate located near the inner pore, rather than recovery of channels from a C-type inactivated state...|$|R

Para tanto, foram realizados 57 cruzamentos entre clones portadores dos alelos Ry adg e Rx 1, e a {{cultivar}} 'Chiquita', resistente à pinta preta (Alternaria solani). Na safra das águas de 2004, 57 famílias clonais foram avaliadas em campo <b>e</b> <b>331</b> clones selecionados considerando a aparência de tubérculos. Desse total de clones, avaliados em mais dois experimentos no verão de 2005, 180 foram selecionados por meio do marcador SCAR RYSC 3 como portadores do alelo Ry adg,. Também foram realizadas uma avaliação de desempenho agronômico na safra de inverno de 2006 e uma avaliação de resistência à pinta preta nas safras de verão de 2007 e 2008. Paralelamente, foi utilizado um marcador CAPS visando à seleção de clones portadores do gene Rx 1. Dessa forma, combinando os resultados dos marcadores moleculares com os de campo, agrupados via índices de seleção, foi possível selecionar 20 clones de alto desempenho agronômico, resistentes à pinta preta e portadores do alelo Ry adg. Devido a problemas apresentados pelo marcador CAPS, apenas sete destes foram analisados e um identificado como portador do alelo Rx 1. The {{purpose of}} this study was to select potato clones with high agronomic performance and resistant to early blight, Potato Virus Y (PVY) and Potato Virus X (PVX). Crossings were done among progenitors carrying the Ry adg and Rx 1 alleles for resistance to PVY and PVX and the cultivar 'Chiquita', which presents high levels of resistance to early blight (Alternaria solani). In the rainy season of 2004, 57 clonal families were evaluated in the field and 331 clones were selected based on tuber appearance. These clones were field evaluated in two trials in the rainy season of 2005 and 180 clones were selected for Ry adg allele with the SCAR marker designed RYSC 3. Another agronomic evaluation was done in the winter season of 2006 and early blight was evaluated in the rainy seasons of 2007 and 2008. Simultaneously a CAPS marker was used to select for the presence of Rx 1 allele. Combining the results from these experiments we were able to select 20 clones presenting high agronomic performance, resistance to early blight and carrying the Ry adg allele. The use of CAPS marker has practical difficulties due to production of poor amplification products to be digested with the DdeI enzyme and should be changed for another marker which shows more efficiency...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} {{the interest and}} knowledge about Medical Ethics and Bioethics in medical graduation. METHODS: Transversal and descriptive study. Two different questionnaires were applied with questions about the interest in Medical Ethics and Bioethics and the knowledge about the Brazilian Code of Medical Ethics (CME), one to professors {{and the other to}} students. RESULTS: One hundred and one professors and 331 students answered the questionnaires. The Brazilian CME had been read by 86. 2 % of the teachers and by 100 % of the students. The importance given to the discipline Medical Ethics, on a scale from 1 to 5, was similar among teachers and students (4. 7 ± 0. 7 vs. 4. 5 ± 0. 8; p = 0. 086); however the self-evaluation on knowledge about this subject was higher in the first group (3. 4 ± 0. 9 vs. 3. 2 ± 0. 7; p = 0. 017). In a block with 9 questions, the right answer was given by 5, 0 ± 1. 9 of teachers and 5. 9 ± 1. 5 of students (p < 0, 001); the mean of correct answers were related to the reading of the CME. CONCLUSIONS: The present study presents unpublished data about the perception of medical teachers and students about medical ethics and bioethics and can be useful for improving the teaching of these disciplines in our medical schools.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy of orally administered leucomycin at 90 and 180 ppm for the prevention of porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE) in experimentally infected pigs. A total of 90 commercial five-week-old pigs were randomly assigned to receive leucomycin in feeding at 90 (T 2), 180 ppm (T 3), or untreated (T 1). All animals in the treated groups received medicated feed for 14 days starting one day before inoculation. Each pig was inoculated intragastrically with approximately 4. 5 x 10 (9) Lawsonia intracellularis in the form of porcine intestinal mucosal homogenate. Body weight, feed consumption and clinic signs were evaluated throughout the study. Necropsies and gross evaluation of intestines were performed in all animals on day 23 post-inoculation (pi) or at death, and ileum samples were collected for immunohistochemistry (IHC) for L. intracellularis. Clinical presentation of the disease was more evident in the non-medicated group (T 1) than in the medicated ones (T 2, T 3) between days 16 and 21 pi. Average daily gain, average daily feed consumption and feed conversion efficiency were better in groups treated with either dose of leucomycin. The total intestine lesion length per group (T 1, T 2 and T 3) was 869, 473 and 331 cm, respectively. The majority of the animals (84. 4 %) were positive for L. intracellularis antigen in ileum sections stained by IHC. Under the conditions of this study, leucomycin administered in feed at 90 and 180 ppm for 14 days was effective in improving performance of pigs inoculated with intestinal homogenate containing L. intracellularis. Este experimento foi realizado com o objetivo de testar a eficiência da leucomicina no controle da EPS. Para isso, utilizaram-se 90 leitões de cinco semanas de idade, provenientes de granja sem histórico clínico de EPS. Os animais foram divididos em três grupos (tratamentos) de 30, sendo T 1 o grupo dos inoculados e não medicados, T 2 e T 3 os inoculados e medicados com 90 ppm e 180 ppm de leucomicina, respectivamente. No dia zero do experimento, os 90 suínos foram inoculados com aproximadamente 4, 5 x 10 (9) L. intracellularis. A medicação foi utilizada nas rações dos grupos T 2 e T 3 somente do dia anterior até 13 dias após a inoculação com L. intracellularis. Ganho de peso, consumo de ração e sinais clínicos foram avaliados durante todo o experimento. Todos os leitões foram eutanasiados 23 dias pós-inoculação (pi). Os sinais clínicos foram mais evidentes nos animais do grupo T 1 que nos do T 2 e do T 3 entre os dias 16 e 21. Ganho de peso diário, consumo diário de ração e conversão alimentar foram melhores nos grupos medicados com leucomicina. A extensão total das lesões intestinais por grupo (T 1, T 2 e T 3) foram de 869, 473 <b>e</b> <b>331</b> cm, respectivamente. A maioria dos animais (84, 4 %) teve marcação positiva para L. intracellularis à IHC nas seções de íleo.

40|$|The target epitopes, {{serotype}} specificity, and cytolytic {{function of}} dengue virus-specific T cells may influence their theoretical roles in protection against secondary infection {{as well as}} the immunopathogenesis of dengue hemorrhagic fever. To study these factors in an experimental system, we isolated dengue virus-specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell clones from dengue- 2 virus-immunized BALB/c mice. The T-cell response to dengue virus in this mouse strain was heterogeneous; we identified at least five different CD 4 + phenotypes and six different CD 8 + phenotypes. Individual T-cell clones recognized epitopes on the dengue virus pre-M, E, NSl/NS 2 A, and NS 3 proteins and were restricted by the I-Ad, I-Ed, Ld, and Kd antigens. Both serotype-specific and serotype-cross-reactive clones were isolated in the CD 4 + and CD 8 + subsets; among CD 8 + clones, those that recognized the dengue virus structural proteins were serotype specific whereas those that recognized the nonstructural proteins were serotype cross-reactive. All of the CD 8 + and one of five CD 4 + clones lysed dengue virus-infected target cells. Using synthetic peptides, we identified an Ld-restricted epitope on the <b>E</b> protein (residues <b>331</b> to 339, SPCKIPFEI) and a Kd-restricted epitope on the NS 3 protein (residues 296 to 310, ARGYISTRVEM GEAA). These data parallel previous findings of studies using human dengue virus-specific T-cell clones. This experimental mouse system may be useful for studying the role of the virus serotype and HLA haplotype on T-cell responses after primary dengue virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Stimulation of {{arginine}} vasopressin 2 receptor (V 2 R) with {{arginine vasopressin}} (AVP) {{results in a}} rise in von Willebrand factor (VWF) and factor VIII plasma levels. We hypothesized that gain-of-function variations in the V 2 R gene (AVPR 2) would lead to higher plasma levels of VWF and FVIII. Methods and Results: We genotyped the control populations of two population-based studies for four AVPR 2 variations: a- 245 c, G 12 E, L 309 L, and S 331 S. Rare alleles of a- 245 c, G 12 <b>E,</b> and S <b>331</b> S, which were in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with higher VWF propeptide, VWF and FVIII levels. The functionality of the G 12 E variant was studied in stably transfected MDCKII cells, expressing constructs of either 12 G-V 2 R or 12 E-V 2 R. Both V 2 R variants were fully glycosylated and expressed on the basolateral membrane. The binding affinity of V 2 R for AVP was increased three-fold in 12 E-V 2 R–green fluorescent protein (GFP) cells, which is in accordance with increased levels of VWF propeptide associated with the 12 E variant. The dissociation constant (KD) was 4. 5 nm [95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 6 – 5. 4] for 12 E-V 2 R–GFP and 16. 5 nm (95 % CI 10. 1 – 22. 9) for 12 G-V 2 R–GFP. AVP-induced cAMP generation was enhanced in 12 E-V 2 R–GFP cells. Conclusions: The 12 E-V 2 R variant has increased binding affinity for AVP, resulting in increased signal transduction, and is associated with increased levels of VWF propeptide, VWF, and FVII...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{demonstrated}} that amino acids E 323, Y 324, E 330, and V 331 from the factor Va heavy chain are required for {{the interaction of the}} cofactor with factor Xa and optimum rates of prothrombin cleavage. We have also shown that amino acid region 332 - 336 contains residues that are important for cofactor function. Using overlapping peptides, we identified amino acids D 334 and Y 335 as contributors to cofactor activity. We constructed recombinant factor V molecules with the mutations D 334 f K and Y 335 f F (factor VKF) and D 334 f A and Y 335 f A (factor VAA). Kinetic studies showed that while factor VaKF and factor VaAA had a KD for factor Xa similar to the KD observed for wild-type factor Va (factor VaWT), the clotting activities of the mutant molecules were impaired and the kcat of prothrombinase assembled with factor VaKF and factor VaAA was reduced. The second-order rate constant of prothrombinase assembled with factor VaKF or factor VaAA for prothrombin activation was ∼ 10 -fold lower than the second-order rate constant for the same reaction catalyzed by prothrombinase assembled with factor VaWT. We also created quadruple mutants combining mutations in the amino acid region 334 – 335 with mutations at the previously identified amino acids that are important for factor Xa binding (i. e., E 323 Y 324 and <b>E</b> 330 V <b>331).</b> Prothrombinase assembled with the quadruple mutant molecules displayed a second-order rate constant up to 400 -fold lower than the values obtained with prothrombinase assembled with factor VaWT.
