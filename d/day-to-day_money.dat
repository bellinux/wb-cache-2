40|$|The {{success of}} both {{microcredit}} and micro-savings products rests upon simplicity and standardization {{in order to}} stimulate client discipline. Meanwhile, these products lack flexibility. This paper attempts {{to make sense of}} behavioral product design in microfinance. We focus on the potential trade-offs between discipline and flexibility. While discipline devices encourage clients make payments duly on time, flexibility improves clients’ <b>day-to-day</b> <b>money</b> management and helps them cope with shocks. Our contribution is twofold. First, we highlight the evidencebased advantages and disadvantages of flexible products in microfinance. Second, we present best-practice examples of flexible products offered bymicrofinance institutions worldwide. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{success of}} {{microfinance}} rests upon product simplicity, standardization, {{and the capacity}} to stimulate client discipline. However, poor people desperately need flexible financial products to improve their <b>day-to-day</b> <b>money</b> management and cope with shocks. This paper discusses how microfinance institutions could design flexible products efficiently. First, we clarify the concept of financial flexibility. Second, based on literature in microfinance, banking, and behavioral economics, we summarize the state of knowledge on the trade-off between flexibility and client discipline. Last, we weigh {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the few flexible products already implemented by microfinance institutions worldwide. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Well-functioning {{financial}} services are key for consumption smoothing {{and to take}} advantage of investment opportunities. Even though poor households badly need {{financial services}} for their <b>day-to-day</b> <b>money</b> management, a commonly held view is that they are ‘too poor’ to save and to repay loans with flexible terms. This paper explores whether this view holds true for two specific flexible financial products, namely passbook savings accounts and credit lines. Analyzing the daily transactions and balances in more than 10, 000 SafeSave accounts—a microfinance institution based in Dhaka, Bangladesh—over nine years (2004 - 2012) shows that clients make extensive use of their flexible savings-and-loan accounts to accommodate changing availability of and needs for liquidity in the face of three kinds of events: paydays, Islamic festivals (Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr, and Eid al-Adha), and political protests (hartals). Cash-in (savings deposit and loan repayment) flexibility is used to cope with both positive (paydays) and negative shocks (Islamic festivals and political protests); cash-out (withdrawal and loan taken) flexibility is used if the negative shock is anticipated well in advance (as in the case of Islamic festivals). We show that, while interest rates on loans are higher than in competing MFIs, repayment rates are comparably high. We also show that SafeSave is covering its operational costs, indicating that this type of flexible financial services can be offered to the poor in a sustainable fashion. Overall, analysis of the SafeSave experience shows that flexible financial products are much in demand by the poor and that they can be profitable for the microfinance institution that offers them. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
50|$|The Jago is {{a seriously}} {{deprived}} {{area in which}} hardly anyone has honest employment or any prospect of it. Existence is solely about survival on a <b>day-to-day</b> basis. <b>Money</b> is squandered in gambling or on drink and tobacco, and children go unfed. In such an environment survival {{is a matter of}} ruthlessness and opportunism.|$|R
40|$|The use {{of mobile}} money, mobile {{payments}} {{and other related}} mobile financial transactions in Africa vary {{from one country to}} another. This {{can be attributed to the}} level of technology maturity, a country’s level of social-economic development and the financial transactions ecosystem. The study investigates usage patterns and adoption of mobile <b>money</b> in <b>day-to-day</b> person-to-person <b>money</b> transfers using mobile telephone, mobile payments and integration of mobile money in financial services in Kenya. The study explores the underlying contextual social and economic factors influencing successful use of mobile money in Kenya by probing the pre-usage (before mobile money) transfer of funds and the innovation attributes of mobile money that could have positively influenced this rapid uptake and continuance intentions. The study employs a survey questionnaire and two focus groups to collect data from mobile money users. The study result indicates that pre-usage methods of money transfers significantly influenced initial uptake of mobile money in Kenya while its technical attributes have sustained a positive influence on continuance intentions. Implications for research and practice are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The {{setting of}} Neptune's Brood {{is the part}} of the galaxy that has since been colonized with slower than light travel. A large part of the plot turns on the {{question}} of financing such colonization. [...] Money, which is entirely cryptocurrency, has been divided into three classes: [...] "fast", [...] "medium", [...] "slow". Fast <b>money</b> is ordinary <b>day-to-day</b> cash, medium <b>money</b> is ordinary investment instruments, suitable for use within a single planetary system, and slow money is interstellar investment instruments, understood to take centuries, even millennia, to mature. Slow money transactions rely on a three-way cryptoverification scheme, and so trade at one-third the speed of light.|$|R
40|$|Inflation {{targeting}} {{has worked}} so well because it leads policymakers to debate, decide on, and communicate the inflation objective. In practice, this process has led the public {{to believe that the}} central bank has a long-term inflation objective. Inflation targeting has been successful, then, because the central bank decides on an objective and announces it, not because of a change in its <b>day-to-day</b> behavior in <b>money</b> markets or the way it reacts to news about unemployment or real GDP. By deciding on an inflation rate and announcing it, the central bank is providing information the public needs to concentrate expectations on a common trend. The central bank gains control indirectly by creating information that makes it more likely that people will price things {{in a way that is}} consistent with the central bank's goal. The way to improve inflation targeting is to be more explicit about the average inflation rate expected over all relevant horizons. Building a target path for the price level, growing at the desired inflation rate, is the best way to institutionalize a low-inflation environment. In a wide variety of economic models, a price-path target mitigates the zero lower bound problem, eliminates worries about deflation, and improves the central bank's ability to stabilize the real economy.
