5|$|The ZX81 {{was also}} sold {{for a while}} in <b>duty-free</b> <b>shops</b> at UK airports. However, this fell foul of {{government}} export restrictions aimed at preventing the Soviet bloc countries from obtaining Western high technology goods. It was not uncommon for visitors from the Soviet Union and other eastern European countries to pick up gadgets in Western countries with the aim of transferring their technology to their own states' industries. In 1983 the government ordered that the ZX81s were to be withdrawn from sale at airports. There was no such restriction on sales to communist China and in November 1983 Sinclair Research announced that it had signed an agreement to export ZX81 kits to a factory in Guangzhou, where they would be assembled for the Chinese market.|$|E

25|$|By 1980, {{although}} 17 {{charter airlines}} were operating from the airport, {{it was making}} a loss. Les Wilson took over as managing director in that year, a position which he held {{until his death in}} a car crash in November 1995; much of the airport's subsequent strong recovery over that period has been attributed to him. The airport moved back into profit in financial year 1981/82, and by 1983/84 the profit was £0.5 million. In 1984, an international departure lounge was added, with <b>duty-free</b> <b>shops</b> and a 24-hour air-side bar.|$|E
25|$|Terminal 1 /closed/ {{has been}} {{extended}} several times over the years. The departures area had 21 check-in counters and six security checkpoints. In the terminal there were various outlets: cafes, fast food restaurants, currency exchange, and <b>duty-free</b> <b>shops.</b> There were ten boarding gates. The arrivals area had two luggage belts, as well as currency exchange and a tax-free shop. Terminal 1 still has a VIP room and business lounge. In 2010 the VIP room at Varna Airport was renovated.

In 1984, the airline introduced Night-Coach service as a low-cost alternative to day-time domestic flights. In the following years, PIA Planetarium was inaugurated in Karachi which was followed by planetariums in Lahore and Peshawar. These planetariums featured retired PIA aircraft on display for educational or observational purposes. Two more retired Boeing 720B aircraft were donated to the planetariums in Karachi and Lahore later on.|$|E
25|$|In late 2007, work {{commenced}} on Skyhub (located {{between the}} Main Terminal and Terminal 2) which created a single, purpose-built security screening area {{in place of}} the previous individual facilities {{for each of the three}} piers, the other side effect being an enlarged duty-free shopping area created by taking most of the previous landside shopping and restaurant facilities airside. This new arrangement also frees up space in the departure lounges through the removal of the separate <b>duty-free</b> <b>shops</b> in the West and Central Piers. This however meant that the former public viewing areas of the apron are now airside, making the airport inaccessible to aviation enthusiasts and spectators.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the summer}} of 2017 Terminal 1 was used for flight check-in, {{security}} screening and passport-control for international flights for passengers of certain low-cost airlines, but following passport control passengers were bussed to the departures concourse of Terminal 3 from which they boarded their flights. All incoming flights for airlines operating out of Terminal 1 were handled in Terminal 3. However, beginning on 19 June 2017 and following several months of renovations, Terminal 1 passengers began being bussed directly to their flights from Terminal 1, although incoming passengers continue to be handled in Terminal 3. The renovations to Terminal 1's boarding area included adding <b>duty-free</b> <b>shops,</b> restaurants and cafes. The terminal was also equipped with advanced checked-baggage handling and screening systems, {{similar to those in}} Terminal 3.|$|E

500|$|Most {{international}} airports {{feature a}} [...] "sterile lounge", an area after security checkpoints within which passengers {{are free to}} move without further security checks. This area can have services such as <b>duty-free</b> <b>shops</b> that sell goods that have been selected and screened with safety in mind, so that purchasing and bringing them on board flights poses no security risks. In addition to employees, only processed passengers with a valid ticket are allowed inside the sterile lounge. Admittance into the sterile area is done in centralized security checkpoints in contrast to e.g. individual checkpoints at each gate. This allows for more efficient processing of passengers with fewer staff, as well as {{makes it possible to}} detect both delays and security threats well ahead of boarding.|$|E
