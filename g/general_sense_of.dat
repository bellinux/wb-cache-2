5|$|The Natchez killed {{almost all}} of the 150 Frenchmen at Fort Rosalie, and only about 20 managed to escape. Most of the dead were unarmed. Women, children, and African slaves were mostly spared; many were locked inside a house on the bluff, guarded by several warriors, from where they could see the events. According to Dumont de Montigny's account of the attack, women seen {{defending}} their husbands from the violence, or trying to avenge them, were taken captive or killed. One woman's unborn baby was reportedly torn from her before she herself was killed. A year after the event, the tally of dead was put at 138 men, 35 women and 56 children, or approximately 230 overall. Some scholars argue that the Natchez spared the African slaves due to a <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> affinity between the Natchez and the Africans; some slaves even joined the Natchez against their masters, while others took the chance to escape to freedom. A group of Yazoo people who were accompanying Commandant du Codère remained neutral during the conflict but were inspired by the Natchez revolt. When they returned to Fort St. Pierre, they destroyed the fort, killing the Jesuit priest and 17 French soldiers.|$|E

A polyneuropathy that involves shooting pains, numbness, and tingling in the hands or feet may develop. A neurologic syndrome called Lyme encephalopathy is associated with subtle cognitive difficulties, insomnia, a <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> feeling unwell, and changes in personality.

25|$|The {{end of the}} seventeenth-century and the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth-century witnessed an increasing concern for vices and immorality spreading all over the country. There was a <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> falling into the worst possible form of behaviour and a common feeling that avarice, vice, idleness, blasphemy, vagrancy and crime were all entangles together pushing people (poor and wealthy, young and old) into a slippery slope to damnation. A drastic social reformation was required and, at the end of the seventeenth-century, societies for the reformation of manners started emerging with a rank of proper paid agents operating locally. Indeed, Defoe was just one of the many eighteenth-century voices believing that at least part of the falling of the offender was due to a weakening of the social and moral values of the English society.|$|E
25|$|It is {{challenging}} {{to determine the}} length of the egg phase because eggs are sometimes eaten as part of a dominance struggle. However, since the first eggs, which produce the first workers, are much less likely to get eaten, one can obtain a <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> the timing. Most of these first eggs hatch within 10–13 days of being laid. Once the eggs hatch, the larval stage begins. The duration of this phase varies significantly, mostly based {{on the development of the}} colony. As the development of the colony varies, so do the feeding practices, and rate of feeding effects the duration of the larval stage. The length of the larval stages peaks at 60 days, but the average larvae remained in the larval phase for 15–30 days.|$|E

25|$|Compared {{to earlier}} research, the {{assimilation}} and transformation of pre-existing architectural traditions is investigated under {{the aspect of}} mutual intra- and intercultural exchange of ideas, technologies and styles as well as artists, architects, and materials. In the area of art and architecture, the Rise of Islam {{is seen as a}} continuous transformation process leading from late Antiquity to the Islamic period. Early research into the area regarded the early Islamic architecture merely as a break with the past, from which apparently rose a distorted and less expressive form of art, or a degenerate imitation of the post-classical architectural forms. Modern concepts tend to regard the transition between the cultures rather as a selective process of informed appropriation and transformation. The Umayyads {{played a crucial role in}} this process of transforming and thereby enriching the existing architectural traditions, or, in a more <b>general</b> <b>sense,</b> <b>of</b> the visual culture of the nascent Islamic society.|$|E

Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race, saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle. CNN has reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot. One anonymous member of the council told CNN that former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum had placed pressure on them to refuse Colbert's application despite his steady rise in polls.|$|E

As was visible through its history of updates during beta testing, {{it went through}} several changes, primarily the increase of gameplay difficulty. One was the addition of dedicated [...] "perma-perma-death" [...] servers, where players could not even re-create characters after dying, {{in contrast to the}} game's generic [...] "perma-death" [...] servers. Another was [...] "blueprints," [...] which allow players to get a <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> a house's layout before entering and thus encourage setting up puzzle-based—rather than luck-based—vault defenses. Rohrer did not, however, want the game to be impossible, so he took the step of forcing players to evade their own traps before the houses would be accessible to others.

500|$|The primary warship of the Byzantine navy {{until the}} 12th {{century was the}} dromon (δρόμων) and other similar ship types. Apparently an {{evolution}} of the light liburnian galleys of the imperial Roman fleets, the term first appears in the late 5th century, and was commonly used for a specific kind of war-galley by the 6th. The term dromōn itself comes from the Greek root δρομ-(άω), [...] "to run", thus meaning [...] "runner", and 6th-century authors like Procopius are explicit in their references to the speed of these vessels. During the next few centuries, as the naval struggle with the Arabs intensified, heavier versions with two or possibly even three banks of oars evolved. Eventually, the term {{was used in the}} <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> [...] "warship", and was often used interchangeably with another Byzantine term for a large warship, chelandion (χελάνδιον, from the Greek word kelēs, [...] "courser"), which first appeared during the 8th century.|$|E

One recurring point raised by Ōji was that many features promised {{had yet to be}} added at that time, which faulted the experience slightly. Rob Fahey of Eurogamer greatly enjoyed the experience, echoing many of the praises given by other journalists, while finding the graphics a little dated, and said that some technical improvements would be positively met. Nick Tylwalk of Gamezebo praised the combat for being much more engaging than other free-to-play games of its type, enjoyed the character customization, and variety of demons, and [...] "excellent" [...] story. His main complaints were a steep learning curve, points where the narrative got lost, and dated-looking graphics and interface. He finished his review by giving the game a score of 3.5 out of 5 stars.|$|E

30|$|The {{scientific}} {{state of}} the art is to output text commentary on very constrained activity such as traffic using simple image features such as trajectory points (see, e.g., [1]). We propose that an accurate commentary of activity can be acquired when there is a good intermediate description of activity available. This enables more complex and more <b>general</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>of</b> the scene than merely trajectories. In fact we develop a sensing strategy around activity recognition and head-pose estimation. This paper, consequently enables the machine to explain more complex, less constrained activity and interactions among people.

500|$|GWA {{studies have}} several issues and {{limitations}} {{that can be}} taken care of through proper quality control and study setup. Lack of well defined case and control groups, insufficient sample size, control for multiple testing and control for population stratification are common problems. [...] Particularly the statistical issue of multiple testing wherein it has been noted that [...] "the GWA approach can be problematic because the massive number of statistical tests performed presents an unprecedented potential for false-positive results". Ignoring these correctible issues has been cited as contributing to a <b>general</b> <b>sense</b> <b>of</b> problems with the GWA methodology. In addition to easily correctible problems such as these, some more subtle but important issues have surfaced. A high-profile GWA study that investigated individuals with very long life spans to identify SNPs associated with longevity is an example of this. The publication came under scrutiny because of a discrepancy between the type of genotyping array in the case and control group, which caused several SNPs to be falsely highlighted as associated with longevity. The study was subsequently retracted.|$|E

[...] Fairall also pointed out that [...] " [...] might hint, at first, in the direction of some Blade Runner-esque sci-fi pathos, but Robyn turns it towards a canny meta-commentary on the fluid sense of authenticity that pervades 21st century pop stardom." [...] Fairall, however, thought that [...] "the verses are nothing more than an inventory of the titular ‘bot’s synthetic virtues." [...] Ben Norman of About.com selected the song as his favorite track on Body Talk Pt. 1, and wrote that [...] "'Fembot' is the incredibly quirky and well-written Robyn-rap track that needs to be heard to be believed."
