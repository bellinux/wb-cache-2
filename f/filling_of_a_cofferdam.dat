50|$|With {{construction}} commencing in May 1974, in {{the following}} August the project suffered its only major construction delay with the failure <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cofferdam.</b> The cofferdam failed at its base where workers were working to set one of the concrete and steel bridge piers.

25|$|Construction {{of the new}} bridge {{began in}} November 1887. Complications arose when the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B), whose tracks ran along the north/eastern shore of the Anacostia River, sued the federal government, arguing that the bridge {{abutment}} encroached on its right-of-way; eventually the railroad agreed to move its tracks closer to the riverbank, {{and the federal government}} paid for the move. But yet more construction delays occurred. Due to the heavily silted bottom of the river, the Army Corps of Engineers could not find solid ground on which to build the bridge's piers and abutments, requiring construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cofferdam</b> and extensive excavation and investigation <b>of</b> the riverbed. <b>A</b> major flood in 1888 damaged some of the work, and caused further delays.|$|R
50|$|The {{ships were}} {{protected}} with an armored belt that was 150 mm thick amidships and reduced to 70 mm forward and 40 mm aft.

The gun turrets had 200 mm thick plating, with 200 mm thick barbettes, while the casemates had marginally thinner protection, at 194 mm. The two pairs of casemates were linked by transverse armored bulkheads; the outer bulkhead was 194 mm thick while the inner bulkhead was 120 mm thick. The main conning tower had 200 mm thick sides.

5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the St. Lawrence Seaway, <b>a</b> system <b>of</b> canals and locks {{that would make the}} St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. <b>As</b> part <b>of</b> the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water {{in order to create a}} navigable channel through the Long Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cofferdam</b> upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|R
50|$|Rescues <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{entrapped}} victim usually entail building makeshift {{retaining walls}} in the grain around them with plywood, sheet metal, tarpaulins, snow fences or any other similar material available. Once that has been done, {{the next step is}} creating the equivalent <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cofferdam</b> within the grain from which grain can then be removed by hand, shovel, grain vacuum or other extraction equipment. While some of these techniques have been used to retrieve engulfed victims or their bodies as well, in those cases it is also common to attempt to cut a hole {{in the side of the}} storage facility; this requires consulting an engineer to make sure it can be done without compromising the facility's structural integrity. There is also the possibility <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dust explosion, although none are known to have occurred yet during a rescue attempt.|$|R
50|$|New {{facilities}} were {{built for the}} park in the early 1950s {{on the site of}} the Spooner’s wheel, which dated from the late 18th century. The mill buildings were demolished and the small reservoir filled in, and were replaced by the children’s playground and café. At the same time paddling pools were constructed between Rivelin Valley Road and the River Rivelin. The river had always been used as an unofficial play area by children and the new pools which were constructed as part of the Festival of Britain celebrations were inspired by the success of the paddling pools at Millhouses Park. The construction of the pools called for the River Rivelin to be diverted by the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cofferdam</b> and puddling. The pools were opened by the Lord Mayor Alderman T.W. Bridgland, J.P on July 27, 1951.|$|R
5000|$|The Salt River {{restoration}} project {{received its}} final permit in September 2012 {{to restore the}} Salt to hydraulic function by means of channel restoration, restoration of the 444 acre Riverside Ranch, upstream sediment reduction efforts, and long-term management.

500|$|The {{contract}} {{called for}} the complete construction of the bridge, including the approaches {{on each side of}} the river and four piers with each consisting of two cylindrical columns of reinforced concrete. Construction of the bridge was complicated by the contract which stipulated that concrete had to be pumped dry, the concrete of each cylinder had to be poured in [...] "one continuous operation" [...] and that the wooden piles for the pier must project at least six feet into the concrete base. These stipulations required the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cofferdam</b> to deposit the concrete, but boring in the river showed that it did not have a suitable bottom upon which to build. Tompkins would have to construct a [...] thick artificial bottom in order to proceed. To deposit in accordance with the contract, a tremie would be needed. A tremie is a pipe that concrete is passed through so it doesn't contact the water and disintegrate.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{builders}} {{of the new}} $1,500,000 Meeker Avenue Bridge was John Kelly, of Greenpoint, Brooklyn, who was a former Navy deep-sea diver and became famous for helping {{to work on the}} new bridge. In 1938, he completed his task <b>of</b> building <b>a</b> <b>cofferdam,</b> <b>a</b> box-like structure made of 250 steel sheets. This enabled workmen to operate and build an underwater pier in dry surroundings on the Greenpoint side of the new bridge; after that, Kelly began cutting away cofferdam bracings on the Queens side, at Laurel Hill Boulevard and Review Avenue. One of the tools he worked with was an underwater-operated cutting torch, which burned oxygen, hydrogen, and compressed air.|$|R

The performed simulations demonstrate {{the ability of the}} model to realistically represent complex features of granular flows during filling processes, such as heap formation and non-zero inclination angle of the bulk material-air interface. In addition, micro-mechanical parametrizations which account for particle size segregation are incorporated into the model. It is found that numerical predictions of segregation phenomena during <b>filling</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> binary granular mixture agree well with experimental results. Further numerical tests indicate the capability of the model to cope successfully with complex operations involving granular mixtures...|$|R

The first concrete pour was on March 16, 1963, and the diversion tunnel was closed in November 1965, allowing the river to begin filling Bighorn Lake. In the same year, the Yellowtail Afterbay Dam, serving to regulate releases from the main dam was completed [...] downstream of Yellowtail Dam. The Yellowtail Dam was topped out in December 1967 after six years of work. Surprisingly, for such a huge structure, only one death occurred during the entire construction process.|$|R

Sir John Hawkshaw constructed a new sluice, consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large <b>cofferdam,</b> with 16 tubes, each [...] in diameter, which passed over the top of it. The tops of these pipes were [...] above the inlet and outlet, and an air pump was used to remove the air from them, so that the water would syphon over the cofferdam. It was the only time that such a solution was tried in the Fens, and it was supplemented in 1880 by a more conventional gravity sluice, also constructed by Hawkshaw, as it was unable to discharge sufficient water.|$|R

5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} <b>a</b> number <b>of</b> delicate {{problems that}} had never been encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cofferdam</b> around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|R
