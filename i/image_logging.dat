In this paper, a new method of flow pattern identification in oil wells by electromagnetic <b>image</b> <b>logging</b> is proposed. First, the characteristics of gas-water and oil-water flow patterns in horizontal and vertical wellbores are picked up. Then, the continuous variation of the two phase flow pattern in the vertical and horizontal pipe space is discretized into continuous fluid distribution models in the pipeline section. Second, the electromagnetic flow image measurement responses of all the eight fluid distribution models are simulated and the characteristic vector of each response is analyzed in order to distinguish the fluid distribution models. Third, the time domain changes of the fluid distribution models in the pipeline section are used to identify the flow pattern. Finally, flow simulation experiments using electromagnetic flow <b>image</b> <b>logging</b> are operated and the experimental and simulated data are compared. The {{results show that the}} method can be used for flow pattern identification of actual electromagnetic <b>image</b> <b>logging</b> data.|$|E

Electrical <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> appear {{to be sensitive to}} variations in mineralogy, porosity, and fluid content that highlight both natural fractures and rock fabrics. These fabric elements account for about 50 % of the total population of planar structures seen in the electrical <b>image</b> <b>log,</b> but locally approach 100 %. This fabric is unlikely to contribute to permeability in the reservoir. Acoustic <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> reveal a similar natural fracture population, but generally image slightly fewer fractures, and do not reveal rock fabric. Both logs also record textural properties of deformed materials within fractures; these textures can be related to variations in mineralogy, alteration, or porosity using the electrical log and can be used to infer slip history. In addition, locations of high fracture density occur adjacent to major faults, but also occur as zones confined within intervals of distinct rock type. The acoustic <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> collected in Well 58 A 10 reveal large numbers of drilling-induced borehole wall tensile fractures and breakouts. In addition, previously un-recognized drilling-induced petal-centerline fractures are evident in images of the borehole wall from this well. These features are thought to form just ahead of the drill bit and provide additional constraint on the orientation of the minimum horizontal stress. Both breakouts and petal-centerline fractures are difficult to identify in electrical <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> because of the low percentage of the borehole wall imaged. Analysis of induced structures in acoustic <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> indicates that the minimum horizontal stress is oriented along an azimuth of 102 º± 18 º.

40|$|<b>Image</b> <b>logs</b> hold {{important}} {{information about the}} subsurface sequences and they provide information about bedding and fault/fracture spatial distribution and characteristics. They can supply insight on the rock texture, textural organization and porosity types and distribution. To reduce the subjectivity of the interpretation and cut the interpretation time we developed and tested a new semi-automatic process for <b>image</b> <b>log</b> interpretation using a new software. This process {{led to the development}} of an expert system (called I 2 AM) that exploits image processing algorithms and clustering techniques, to analyze and classify borehole images. This system extrapolates the maximum amount of information from the <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> by considering not only the surfaces that cut the borehole but also the textural features of the images. Once the <b>image</b> <b>log</b> are analysed the application of clustering techniques to the values extracted from the borehole images supply a consistent classification of the images and the propagation of this classification along the logged section. In this way, we can automatically extract rock properties information with two main advantages: (i) avoid the subjectivity of the interpretation, (ii) reduce the interpretation time. The final results of this process is a set of “image facies” identified along the <b>image</b> <b>log</b> obtained by a largely automated log interpretation, although some level of human interaction and correction is still necessary. We define the clustering application as semi-automatic because the interpreter can decide, based on his geological background and on the geological characteristics of the logged section, to keep the clusters/classes proposed by the system or modify the number of clusters/classes. The clustering process and the propagation of the classes along the logged section is very fast (30 seconds) allowing an interactive approach, producing several scenarios with different number of classes and/or allowing a quick update of the <b>image</b> <b>log</b> interpretation once more data/knowledge is acquired.

40|$|Oil {{production}} from the Arab D Reservoir {{in the super}} giant Ghawar Field is affected by extreme flow rates at the wellbore from very thin geologic intervals. Reservoir flood front management in these areas is extremely challenging since the reservoir fluids, including injected water, follow these pathways at unpredictable velocities. As the field matures {{it has become more}} important to understand the distribution of these features and the extent of their fluid communication. New types of data such as 3 D seismic and borehole <b>image</b> <b>logging,</b> as well as more integrated methods of interpreting traditional wireline logs and production data are being employed. New mathematical methods of building geological models have also been utilized. The result has been a more sophisticated model of flow interaction between high permeability rock types and a fracture system whose impact was previously underestimated. Modeling the reservoir matrix heterogeneities and overlaying them with the fractures has yielded the most promising results. These changes suggest that calculations of OOIP (original oil in place) and ultimate recovery may be substantially different when taken into account. In the present study 3 D stochastic models of reservoir attributes including, lithology, porosity, and permeability were developed to investigate the nature and distribution of high permeability in the Arab D reservoir. Wells logs, core analyses, and production logs constitute the hard data. Acoustic impedance from a stochastic inversion of 3 D seismic data is used to constrain the simulation of well data. In addition, coherency attributes from the 3 D seismic and the 3 D acoustic impedance were used to interpret the subtle faults and fracture swarms that affected the fluid flow.

Due to their great heterogeneity affected by the differential roles of lithologic facies and karstification, huge differences exist in the single-well gas yield tests. To improve the development efficiency of gas reservoirs and achieve the goal of “high yield but with few wells to be drilled”, {{it is especially important}} to establish a high-yield gas well mode by use of cores, logging, seismic data, etc., and through analysis of reservoir properties, high-yield controlling factors, and seismic response features of quality reservoirs and so on. The following findings were achieved. (1) The positive relationship between yield and the thickness of dissolved vug reservoirs is obvious. (2) The dissolved vug reservoirs are reflected as the type of honeycomb dark patches from the <b>image</b> <b>logging</b> and the conventional logging is featured generally by “Three Lows and Two Highs (i. e., low GR, low RT and low DEN but high AC and high CNL) ”. (3) From the seismic profile, the highlighted spots (strong peaks) correspond to the bottom boundary of the Longwangmiao Fm reservoirs. The trough waves in larger amplitude represents that there are more well-developed karsts in the reservoirs. On this basis, high-quality 3 D seismic data was used for tracking and fine interpretation of those highlighted spots and trough waves on the strong peaks to describe the plane distribution of high-yield dissolved vug reservoirs in this study area. This study is of great significance to the good planning of development wells and well trajectory planning and adjustment.

Identified in <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> are 508 fractures and 523 stress indicators, showing maximum horizontal stress orientation in the Penola Trough is 127 °N. Two fracture types were identified: (1) 268 electrically conductive (potentially open to fluid flow) fractures with mean NW-SE strikes and (2) 239 electrically resistive (closed to fluid flow) fractures with mean E-W strikes. Core from Jacaranda Ridge- 1 shows that open fractures are rarer than what <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> indicate, {{due to the}} presence of fracture-filling siderite, an electrically conductive cement which may cause fractures to appear hydraulically conductive in <b>image</b> <b>logs.</b> The majority of fractures detected is favorably oriented for reactivation under in situ stresses, although it is demonstrated that fracture fills primarily control which fractures are open. Seismic attributes calculated from the 3 -D Balnaves/Haselgrove survey are mapped to the Pretty Hill Formation to enhance observations of structural fabrics, showing linear discontinuities likely representing faults and fractures.

40|$|Declining {{conventional}} hydrocarbon reserves {{coupled with}} {{technological advances and}} growing energy demands have triggered a shift in exploration of energy-rich Australian basins, with a progressive focus on unconventional energy sources, such as coal seam gas, shale gas and enhanced geothermal systems. Unconventional play viability is often heavily dependent {{on the presence of}} secondary permeability due to interconnected natural fractures, as they commonly exert a prime control over total permeability due to low primary permeabilities. The structural permeability of the Northern Perth, South Australian Otway, and Northern Carnarvon basins are characterised using an integrated approach combining geophysical wellbore logs, seismic attribute analysis and detailed structural descriptions of core and outcrop. Integration of these methods allows for the identification of faults and fractures over a range of scales, providing crucial permeability information. New stress orientation data is also interpreted, and allows for stress-based predictions of fracture reactivation to be made. This study represents the first attempt at generating a database of fracture properties for Australian sedimentary basins through the combination of several methodologies, and addresses three significant scientific questions: 1) What are the main factors controlling fracture reactivation in Australian basins? 2) Can 3 D seismic attributes be used to identify natural fractures in the subsurface beyond the wellbore? And, 3) Are electrically conductive fractures in <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> actually open to fluid flow? This study demonstrates that distinct correlations exist between natural structural fabrics identified in 3 D seismic attribute analysis and the natural fractures identified through interpretation of electrical resistivity <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> from petroleum wells, and supports the supposition that similar features at different scales are being identified. Fracture reactivation within the studied basins, in particular the Otway and Carnarvon basins, shows that fracture reactivation can become complex, and depend not only on the in-situ stress regime but also fracture fills, as well as local and regional structures. Natural fractures identified on <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> as being electrically conductive are generally assumed to be hydraulically conductive. However, Otway Basin core shows open fractures are rarer than <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> indicate, and this is likely due to the presence of fracture filling siderite. Siderite is an iron-carbonate mineral that may cause fractures to appear hydraulically conductive on <b>image</b> <b>logs.</b> The techniques outlined herein represent an effective method by which potential structural permeability can be assessed on a regional scale with various levels of data availability. This is demonstrated in several case studies of Australian sedimentary basins featuring varying datasets. Basin-wide structural permeability is constrained using a variety of data, ranging from predominantly using <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> supported by 3 D seismic, to performing a basin-wide assessment using <b>image</b> <b>logs,</b> 3 D seismic, core, and outcrop studies.

30|$|Tight {{formations}} {{normally have}} production problems mainly due to very low matrix permeability and {{various forms of}} formation damage that occur during drilling completion and production operation. In naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs, gas is mainly stored in the rock matrix with very low permeability, and the natural fractures have the main contribution on total gas production. Therefore, identifying natural fractures characteristics in the tight formations is essential for well productivity evaluations. Well testing and logging are the common tools employed to evaluate well productivity. Use of <b>image</b> <b>log</b> can provide fracture static parameters, and welltest analysis can provide data related to reservoir dynamic parameters. However, due to the low matrix permeability {{and complexity of the}} formation in naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs, welltest data are affected by long wellbore storage effect that masks the reservoir response to pressure change, and it may fail to provide dual-porosity dual-permeability models dynamic characteristics such as fracture permeability, fracture storativity ratio and interporosity flow coefficient. Therefore, application of welltest and <b>image</b> <b>log</b> data in naturally fractured tight gas reservoirs for meaningful results may not be well understood and the data may be difficult to interpret. This paper presents the estimation of fracture permeability in naturally fractured tight gas formations, by integration of welltest analysis results and <b>image</b> <b>log</b> data based on Kazemi’s simplified model. Reservoir simulation of dual-porosity and dual-permeability systems and sensitivity analysis are performed for different matrix and fracture parameters to understand the relationship between natural fractures parameters with welltest permeability.

A field example is also shown to demonstrate application of welltest analysis and <b>image</b> <b>log</b> data processing results in estimating average permeability of natural fractures for the tight gas reservoir.|$|R
40|$|Borehole imaging {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} and most precise methods for {{collecting}} subsurface data that provides high resolution information on layering, texture and dips, permitting a core-like description of the subsurface. Although the range of information recoverable from this technology is widely acknowledged, <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> are still used in a strictly qualitative manner. Interpreting <b>image</b> <b>logs</b> manually is cumbersome, time consuming and is subjective based on the experience of the interpreter. This thesis outlines new methods that automate <b>image</b> <b>log</b> interpretation and extract subsurface lithofacies information in a quantitative manner. We developed two methodologies based on advanced image analysis techniques successfully employed in remote sensing and medical imaging. The first one is a pixelbased pattern recognition technique applying textural analysis to quantify image textural properties. These properties together with standard logs and core-derived lithofacies information are used to train a back propagation Neural Network. In principle the trained and tested Neural Network is applicable for automated borehole image interpretation from similar geological settings. However, this pixel-based approach fails to make use explicitly of the spatial characteristics of a high resolution image. TAT second methodology is introduced which groups identical neighbouring pixels into objects. The resultant spectrally and spatially consistent objects are then related to geologically meaningful groups such as lithofacies by employing fuzzy classifiers. This method showed better results and is applied to outcrop photos, core photos and <b>image</b> <b>logs,</b> including a ‘difficult’ data set from a deviated well. The latter <b>image</b> <b>log</b> did not distinguish some of the conductive and resistive regions, as observed from standard logs and core photos. This is overcome by marking bed boundaries using standard logs. Bed orientations were estimated using an automated sinusoid fitting algorithm within a formal uncertainty framework in order to distinguish dipping beds and horizontal stratification. Integration of these derived logs in the methodology yields a complete automated lithofacies identification, even from the difficult dataset. The results were validated through the interpretation of cored intervals by a geologist. This is a supervised classification method which incorporates the expertise of one or several geologists, and hence includes human logic, reasoning, and current knowledge of the field heterogeneity. By including multiple geologists in the training, the results become less dependent on each individual’s subjectivity and prior experience. The method is also easily adaptable to other geological settings. In addition, it is applicable to several kinds of borehole images, for example wireline electrical borehole wall images, core photographs, and logging-while-drilling (LWD) images. Thus, the theme of this dissertation is the development of methodologies which makes <b>image</b> <b>log</b> interpretation simpler, faster, less subjective, and efficient such that it can be applied to large quantities of data.
