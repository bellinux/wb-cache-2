50|$|The Crohn's Disease Activity Index or CDAI is a {{research}} tool used to quantify the symptoms of patients with Crohn's disease. This is of useful <b>importance</b> <b>in</b> <b>research</b> studies done on medications used to treat Crohn's disease; most major studies on newer medications use the CDAI in order to define response or remission of disease. As Crohn's disease is a disease {{with a variety of}} symptoms that affect quality of life, the quantification of symptoms may be of secondary importance to a quantitative assessment of the effect on quality of life. This has been addressed by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and other indices of quality of life for patients with Crohn's disease.|$|E

However, localizing ontologies is not a trivial task.

We underpin our argument with results from a multiple-case study on learning in construction organisations. We show that learning cannot be segregated from immediate practice and occurs when individuals engage in project work. Particularly the orientation towards project goals and project-overarching ambitions or trajectories can serve as contextual binder for learning in and between projects...|$|E
