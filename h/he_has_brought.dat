However, Reed's analysis leads him to believe that the final component needed to deal with the rift is lightning, and Donal is convinced to turn into the Viking god once more.|$|E

Hagrid asks the three of them to look after Grawp if he himself must leave the school. Sure enough, Umbridge leads a party of Aurors to attack Hagrid in his house one night.

5|$|Kratos surprises Zeus, seizes the Blade of Olympus, {{and finally}} incapacitates him. Athena {{intervenes}} and implores Kratos to stop, as by killing Zeus, he will destroy Olympus. Kratos ignores her {{and tries to}} kill Zeus, but Athena sacrifices herself by impaling herself upon the blade, granting Zeus escape. Before she dies, Athena reveals that Kratos is actually Zeus' son. Zeus was afraid Kratos would usurp him, just as Zeus had usurped his own father, Cronos.

One day during the monsoon season, Durga plays in the downpour for too long, catches a cold and develops a high fever. Adequate medical care being unavailable, the fever becomes worse, and on a night of incessant rain and gusty winds, she dies. Harihar returns home and starts to show Sarbajaya the merchandise <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> from the city. Sarbajaya, who remains silent, breaks down at the feet of her husband, and Harihar cries out in grief as he discovers that he has lost his daughter. The family decide to leave their ancestral home.

The Knights of the Grail passionately urge Amfortas to uncover the Grail again but Amfortas, in a frenzy, says he will never again show the Grail. He {{commands}} the Knights, instead, to kill him and end his suffering and the shame <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> on the Knighthood. At this moment, Parsifal steps forth and says that only one weapon can heal the wound (""). He touches Amfortas' side with the Spear and both heals and absolves him.

25|$|Hick {{suggests}} that when listing {{the attributes of}} God, the starting point should be his self-existence ("aseity") which implies that his eternal and unconditioned nature. Hick goes on to consider the following additional attributes: Creator being {{the source of all}} that composes his creation ("creatio ex nihilo") and the sustainer of what <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> into being; Personal; Loving, Good; and Holy. Berkhof also starts with self-existence but moves on to immutability; infinity, which implies perfection eternity and omnipresence; unity. He then analyses a series of intellectual attributes: knowledge-omniscience; wisdom; veracity and then, the moral attributes of goodness (including love, grace, mercy and patience); holiness and righteousness before dealing finally with his sovereignty.|$|E

Then he tries to abduct her, but he is immediately set upon by all those in the castle, fights his way to safety and returns alone to Paris to a hero's welcome. Florent is knighted and the listener is treated to another comic scene as Clement worries that he might {{have to pay for the}} feast that the King of France and the Emperor of Rome have put on in Florent's honour.

Duke instead heads to a payphone and calls Gonzo, learning {{that he has a}} suite in his name at the Flamingo Las Vegas so he can cover a district attorney's convention on narcotics. Duke checks into his suite, only to be met by an LSD-tripping Gonzo, and a young girl by the name of Lucy <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> with him.

25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>brought</b> back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about is a tiny oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E

25|$|While visiting Haafdan {{the group}} also {{encounters}} Gudrid, Leif's former sister-in-law, who is {{to be married to}} Haafdan's son Sigurd. Gudrid has no wish to marry Sigurd however, as she dreams of traveling the world as a sailor like Leif has done. Nonetheless she feels she {{has no choice but to}} obey her family's wishes to remain on Iceland and marry Sigurd. However, during their wedding night Gudrid losers her composure and ends up stabbing Sigurd in his thigh. When Sigurd strikes her in return, she panics and flees.

Gudrid informs them of what had happened and breaks down in despair over not being able to live the life she wants because she was born a woman. Thorfinn takes pity on Gudrid and offers her to go with them, but makes it clear that she might never return alive. Gudrid eventually agrees and the group quickly leaves Iceland.
