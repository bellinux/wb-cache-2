40|$|Background: Melanoma {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{immunogenic}} tumors that causes a significant immune response. Tumor <b>infiltrating</b> lymphocytes are an important part of this response. Tumor <b>infiltrating</b> lymphocytes are lymphocytes in close association with tumor cells that have <b>infiltrated</b> tumor nests. In this study, we attempt to evaluate the relationship of tumor <b>infiltrating</b> lymphocytes in malignant melanoma with histopathologic findings, tumor stage, and other prognostic factors. Methods: This was a retrospective cross-sectional study. We re-evaluated patients’ specimens and categorized the tumor <b>infiltrating</b> lymphocytes as grades 0, 1, 2, or 3 based on density and distribution of the <b>infiltrating</b> lymphocytes. Results:We enrolled 111 patients with a mean age of 59. 33 ± 14. 68 years, and a male to female ratio of 1. 09. There was no evidence of tumor <b>infiltrating</b> lymphocytes in 17. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract.

40|$|ObjectivesUnilateral <b>infiltrates</b> on {{chest x-ray}} films are {{occasionally}} seen after bilateral lung transplantation. In the primary graft dysfunction grading system, {{the presence or}} absence of a radiographic abnormality is crucial in determining the incidence and severity of primary graft dysfunction. However, no consideration is given as to whether unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> have the same impact and relevance as bilateral <b>infiltrates.</b> This study aims to describe the incidence, features, and outcomes of posttransplant unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> and their effect on the novel primary graft dysfunction grading system. MethodsDepending on posttransplant radiographic appearance, 144 patients who underwent bilateral lung transplantation were divided into 3 groups: no <b>infiltrates</b> (clear), unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> (unilateral), or bilateral <b>infiltrates</b> (bilateral). ResultsRadiographic abnormalities were seen in 43 % of donors and 61 % of posttransplant recipients (sensitivity = 76 %, specificity = 50 %). The percentage of recipients in the unilateral, clear, and bilateral groups was 26 %, 39 %, and 35 %, respectively. Lower posttransplant oxygenation (P <. 05), longer intubation hours, and more intensive care unit days (P <. 0001) were seen in the bilateral compared with the unilateral and the clear groups. A significant difference in the prevalence of primary graft dysfunction (P <. 0001) was seen, depending on whether unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> were included or excluded from the primary graft dysfunction grading. ConclusionsThe incidence of unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> is relatively high after bilateral lung transplantation. The early posttransplant outcome of the unilateral <b>infiltrates</b> is similar to that in the group having a clear chest x-ray film and significantly better than that in those with bilateral <b>infiltrates.</b> In bilateral lung transplantation, only bilateral <b>infiltrates</b> should be used as part of the definition of primary graft dysfunction...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of incipient pancreatic neoplasia {{is an essential}} foundation for the future development of effective screening tests for pancreatic cancer. Only when we understand early pancreatic neoplasms will {{we be able to}} detect tumors that are curable with surgical resection. Two approaches have helped define incipient pancreatic neoplasia. First, the histologic examination of pancreata has helped identify the most common histologic lesions in pancreatic tissues adjacent to <b>infiltrating</b> carcinomas. The assumption is that some of these lesions represent the precursors to the <b>infiltrating</b> cancers. Second, advances in molecular genetics now make it possible to define the genetic alterations present in small lesions. The demonstration that a suspected precursor lesion and an <b>infiltrating</b> pancreatic carcinoma share the same genetic alterations would help establish that the lesion is indeed a precursor to <b>infiltrating</b> pancreatic carcinoma. A spectrum of intraductal proliferations in the pancreas has been found associated with <b>infiltrating</b> adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. These lesions, called "duct lesions," have even been identified in pancreata years before patients develop <b>infiltrating</b> carcinoma.

These alterations include activation of K-ras and inactivation of p 16, p 53 and, rarely BRCA 2. From these morphologic and molecular observations, we can now develop a progression model for the development of <b>infiltrating</b> carcinoma of the pancreas. <b>Infiltrating</b> carcinomas of the pancreas may arise from pancreatic duct lesions, and the progression of duct lesions to <b>infiltrating</b> cancer is associated with the accumulation of generalized and specific genetic alteration...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{critical}} role of <b>infiltrated</b> nanoparticles (NPs) on the electrocatalytic activity of cathodes of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for O 2 reduction reaction is studied on well-defined and microstructurally clean Pt electrodes using <b>infiltrated</b> La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 CoO 3 (LSC), La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 Co 0. 5 Mn 0. 5 O 3 (LSCM), and La 0. 8 Sr 0. 2 MnO 3 (LSM) NPs. The promotion factor, fp, as {{defined as the}} ratio of electrode polarization resistance, RE of the electrode prepared by the conventional method {{to that of the}} <b>infiltrated</b> electrode measured under identical conditions, is close to unit for the 0. 2 mg cm− 2 NPs <b>infiltrated</b> Pt electrodes, indicating that the promotion effect of <b>infiltrated</b> perovskite NPs on the electrocatalytic activity of Pt electrodes is very small or negligible under open circuit conditions. However, under dc bias of 100 mV, fp is 35, 18 and 7 for the <b>infiltrated</b> LSC-Pt, LSCM-Pt and LSM-Pt electrodes, respectively. The electrode activity is significantly promoted by the presence of the NPs under cathodic polarization conditions.

40|$|The oral {{lichen planus}} (OLP) is a chronic {{inflammatory}} disease, probably autoimmune, with different clinical forms. The most common types are the reticular and the erosive ones. Apoptosis {{participates in the}} destruction of basal keratinocytes, but its role in the perpetuation of the subepithelial lymphocytic <b>infiltrates</b> was not yet investigated. To evaluate the involvement of apoptosis in the epithelium and in subepithelial lymphocytic <b>infiltrates,</b> 15 samples of reticular and erosive OLP and 10 samples of healthy oral mucosa were collected and processed histologically. Apoptosis was quantified in the epithelium and in inflammatory cell <b>infiltrates.</b> TUNEL reaction was used to measure apoptosis in the <b>infiltrates.</b> Erosive OLP showed more intense epithelial apoptosis than reticular OLP and controls. In contrast, apoptosis in the inflammatory cell <b>infiltrates</b> was more frequent in reticular than in erosive OLP. Lymphocytes were the predominant cells within the inflammatory cell <b>infiltrates</b> and were more frequent in erosive OLP than in reticular type. These results suggest that different apoptotic levels are involved in the erosive/reticular switch in OLP, determining different clinical presentations. In conclusion, decreased apoptosis in inflammatory <b>infiltrates</b> may contribute to the persistence of T lymphocytes, worsening the attack to the epithelium in erosive OLP...|$|R

40|$|To {{identify}} histamine-producing cells at {{the late}} phase of allergic inflammation, {{the expression of}} l-histidine decarboxylase (HDC) was examined in the <b>infiltrating</b> leucocytes in the inflammatory locus. HDC activity and HDC mRNA levels in the <b>infiltrating</b> leucocytes in the pouch fluid of the immunized rats (that were injected with the antigen solution into the air pouch) were increased compared {{with those in the}} <b>infiltrating</b> leucocytes of the non-immunized rats. When <b>infiltrating</b> leucocytes collected 8 hr after antigen injection were cultured, histamine production by the cells from the immunized rats was higher than that from the non-immunized rats. In situ hybridization of HDC mRNA revealed that almost all the <b>infiltrating</b> leucocytes of the immunized rats, 4 hr after injection of the antigen, expressed HDC mRNA with high intensity, while those of the non-immunized rats showed only a weak intensity of HDC mRNA. In the immunized rats, ≈ 90 % of leucocytes <b>infiltrating</b> in the pouch fluid at 4 hr were neutrophils and 8 % were monocytes/macrophages.
