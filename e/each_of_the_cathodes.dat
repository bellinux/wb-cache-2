40|$|An {{emission}} current control system for balancing the individual {{emission current}}s from {{an array of}} hollow cathodes has current sensors for determining the current drawn by each cathode from a power supply. Each current sensor has an output signal which has a magnitude proportional to the current. The current sensor output signals are averaged, the average value so obtained being applied to a respective controller for controlling <b>the</b> flow <b>of</b> an ion source material through each cathode. Also applied to each controller are the respective sensor output signals for each cathode and a common reference signal. <b>The</b> flow <b>of</b> source material through each hollow cathode is thereby made proportional to the current drawn by that <b>cathode,</b> <b>the</b> average current drawn by all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathodes,</b> and <b>the</b> reference signal.

40|$|Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC {{materials}} {{have become the}} state-of-the-art sidewall block materials used in aluminium electrolysis cells. Despite its outstanding properties, the material properties degradate in the cell over time. The mineralogical transformations and chemical reactions cause changes in the physical and thermal properties, which influence <b>the</b> thermal balance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> electrolysis cell. Sodium {{plays an important role}} in <b>the</b> degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sidewall block, as in <b>the</b> other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> lining, and <b>the</b> transportation <b>of</b> sodium in <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> lining has been in focus in the study in order to understand the degradation mechanisms. Commercial virgin Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC {{materials have}} been thoroughly characterized with respect to microstructure and phase composition. α -Si 3 N 4 was found more pronounced in the area close to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virgin block than in the center by refinement of X-ray diffraction patterns. <b>The</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The needle grains in the nitride binder were confirmed to be α -Si 3 N 4 by transmission electron microscopy, while β -Si 3 N 4 was proposed to be hexagonal rod shaped grains. The apparent porosity was lower in the area close to the surface while the density was higher. <b>The</b> degradation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC materials was studied by investigating spent blocks. The degradation mechanisms in the gas zone (top part) and the electrolyte zone (bottom part) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spent sidewall block were different due to the different chemical environments in the cell. In the electrolyte zone, the degradation involves reactions with sodium, and the main degradation phase was Na 2 SiO 3 or a mixture of Na 2 SiO 3 and Na 2 Si 2 O 5. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> only Na 2 SiO 3 points to a higher chemical potential <b>of</b> sodium. <b>The</b> formed silicates filled up the pores and dramatically decreased the apparent porosity. <b>The</b> layer structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sodium silicate was confirmed by SEM. In the gas zone, the degradation mechanism was more complicated. The material underwent active oxidation, and the main degradation phase was Si 2 ON 2 or cristobalite depending on <b>the</b> partial pressure <b>of</b> oxygen. <b>The</b> apparent porosity and density <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulk material was not significantly changed compared to the virgin material. At <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> block towards the pot, material loss was observed. The remaining material at the surface appeared porous and a significantly higher porosity was inferred. The needles in the binder in the gas zone was found thinner compared to the ones found in the virgin material. HF was proposed to play an important role in the material loss at the surface and the change in <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> binder. <b>The</b> thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Si 3 N 4 -bonded SiC materials before and after operation was measured by the lasher flash method. The thermal conductivity was found to be higher in the area close to <b>the</b> surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> virgin block than in the center despite a higher apparent porosity at the surface. Moreover, the thermal conductivity dropped dramatically in both the electrolyte zone and <b>the</b> gas zone <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spent blocks. The variation in <b>the</b> thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material was modeled taking into account the phase composition, the apparent porosity and the microstructure related properties such as grain boundary resistance, pore shape and orientation factor and finally a thermal resistance layer. Both analytical models and computer simulations showed that the microstructure evolution had a strong influence on the thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the computer simulation demonstrated that the drop in <b>the</b> thermal conductivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sidewall block would result in a hotter surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> block towards the bath and a thinner side ledge. Sodium diffusion and reaction throughout <b>the</b> whole <b>cathode</b> lining has been investigated by a computer simulation by taking into consideration the different degradation mechanisms in <b>each</b> material <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> lining. <b>The</b> simulation demonstrated that <b>the</b> dominant transport <b>of</b> sodium in <b>the</b> carbon <b>cathode</b> was solid phase diffusion. The diffusion in the sidewall block was gas phase diffusion, and the diffusion is to some degree limited by the chemical reactions. Using <b>the</b> diffusion constant <b>of</b> sodium in <b>the</b> refractory layer close to the sodium selfdiffusion in an albite like molten oxide reproduced the sodium penetration depth found in autopsies. As shown in the work, sodium causes the severe degradation in <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> lining. Moreover, it “opens” the way for the bath to penetrate into <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> lining resulting in more severe degradation. Two approaches were applied to estimate the bath infiltration rate into <b>the</b> carbon <b>cathode</b> block. <b>The</b> simulations demonstrated that the infiltration rate was determined by the changes in <b>the</b> wetting property <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carbon material towards the bath, meaning that it was determined by the sodium diffusion rate, which explains that sodium always infiltrates faster than the bath. A diffusion barrier (like a steel plate or a chemical barrier) is recommended to be placed between the ramming paste (big joint) and the sidewall block, which could inhibit/reduce the sodium infiltration into the sidewall block and so eliminate further degradation. That will not only improve <b>the</b> chemical stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sidewall block but also its thermal stability, and thereby maintain the thermal balance during the cell operation. This may also open up for heat recovery from the heat flux through the side walls. PhD i materialteknologiPhD in Materials Technolog...|$|R

In this paper we present updated designs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> stalk and FPC. Multipacting in <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> stalk and FPC was simulated using three different codes. All simulation results show no serious multipacting in <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> stalk and FPC...|$|R
50|$|Electrodeposited copper adheres quite {{firmly to}} the {{stainless}} steel {{so that it does}} not detach during refining. <b>The</b> vertical edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stainless steel plates are covered with tight-fitting polymer edge strips to prevent copper depositing around <b>the</b> edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> plate and so make it easier to strip <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> copper from them. <b>The</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> plates were masked with a thin film of wax, again to prevent the copper depositing around the bottom edge. Wax was used rather than an edge strip to avoid having a ledge that would collect falling anode slimes and contaminate <b>the</b> <b>cathode</b> copper.|$|R
