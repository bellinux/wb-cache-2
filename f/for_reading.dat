5|$|Printing {{had been}} known in Japan from at least the 8th century, when {{a large number of}} dharani known as Hyakumantō Darani were printed from 764 to 770 and placed in {{miniature}} wooden pagodas. These count among the oldest extant printed texts in East Asia and were likely made by woodblock printing. The Hyakumantō Darani were ritual Buddhist printings, neither meant for distribution nor <b>for</b> <b>reading.</b> This practice of devotional printing continued into the Heian period. The first practical printing in Japan can be dated to the 11th century and is associated with sutra commentaries and doctrinal works for which handcopying did not entail religious merit. Despite the increasing popularity of printing, many texts, particularly Japanese literature, continued to be copied by hand on manuscript scrolls. Commercial printing did not become common until the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Robin Friday (27 July 1952– 22 December 1990) was an English footballer {{who played}} professionally as a forward <b>for</b> <b>Reading</b> and Cardiff City during {{a career that}} lasted {{four years in the}} mid-1970s. His on-field {{performances}} were regarded as excellent, and he won Reading's player of the year award in both of his full seasons there, as well as being the leading goal scorer. However, his habit of unsettling opponents through physical intimidation contributed to a heavily tarnished disciplinary record, and his personal life was one of heavy smoking, drinking, womanising and drug abuse. Despite his short career, he remains prominent in the memory of Reading and Cardiff supporters, both as a player and a personality. He has been voted Reading's best ever player three times.|$|E
5|$|Abovian's poetry {{was filled}} with satire best {{expressed}} in The wine jug, in which he criticized Russian bureaucracy. Leisure entertainment was adapted by Abovian from notes he took in public gatherings. The work {{is a collection of}} fables in verse that chastise vice, injustice and moral degeneration. He wrote scientific and artistic non-fiction works such as the Discovery of America and Book of Stories. Abovian translated to the Armenian language the works of Homer, Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, Nikolay Karamzin, I. A. Krylov and others. He continued promoting secular and comprehensive (mental, moral, working, physical) training, school accessibility, free education for the indigent and equal education of boys and girls. Pedagogical compositions of Abovian include the book <b>for</b> <b>reading</b> Introduction to education (1838), a textbook of Russian grammar and an Armenian-language novel History of Tigran, or a moral manual for the Armenian children (printed in 1941). He was the first Armenian to study scientific ethnography: the way of life and customs of the peasants of the native settlements around Kanaker, inhabitants of Yerevan, and gathered and studied Armenian and Kurdish folklore.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: SRAM often {{faces the}} problem of read {{stability}} due to static noise while reading, as the basic latch is accessed by the access transistors which may cause external noise to corrupt the stored data. The aim {{of this paper is}} to analyze the read behaviour of the multiple SRAM cell structures using cadence tool at 45 nm technology and to compare the cells <b>for</b> <b>read</b> operation while keeping the read and write access time and the supply voltage as low as possible. While the conventional 6 T cell utilizes the same word line <b>for</b> <b>read</b> as well as write access, the new cell structures described in this paper use a different <b>read</b> enable line <b>for</b> <b>read</b> operation. This allows the memory element to remain isolated from any disturbance due to bit-lines or access transistors...|$|R
