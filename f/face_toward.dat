5|$|The fatwa {{reaffirmed the}} {{obligation}} of Spanish Muslims to perform the ritual prayers (salat), the ritual charity (zakat), and the ritual ablution (ghusl), {{even if they could}} not be performed in the correct form. It described {{the obligation of}} the ritual prayersnormally performed by standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting in a prescribed sequenceeven if done only by making slight movements. The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry ablution (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual ablution (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E
5|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of A. atacis {{is a group}} of three connected dorsal vertebrae. Cervical vertebrae are uncommon from Bellevue {{and most of them are}} poorly preserved. The vertebrae are opisthocoelous, with centra that lengthen toward the rear. Neural spines have been preserved on the vertebrae, and they <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> the rear. Two dorsal vertebrae were preserved with a complete, but very crushed neural arch, a neural spine with a characteristic shape: it is very widened distally and narrows downwards. The vertebrae also have an internal structure that is spongy, with very large cells. The caudal vertebrae are all strongly procoelous and are compressed on the sides. The neural spines of the caudal vertebrae are very narrow and very tall and point toward the rear. The middle caudal vertebrae are more compressed on the sides that the others. Also, the centrum of middle caudal vertebrae is longer proportionally. Two sacral vertebrae were known from Bellevue. They are poorly preserved, and are thought to belong to a juvenile. A complete sacrum was also found in 2002.|$|E
25|$|The ambush was {{initiated}} {{by a small}} element striking {{the head of an}} enemy column and stopping it by fire. Then the main body would attack the column from the rear and/or flank, fragmenting it and rolling it up. The two strikes were timed close enough together so that the target column was engaged from both ends before it could deploy and <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> either danger.|$|E

25|$|Regular {{satellites}} {{are usually}} tidally locked (that is, their orbit is synchronous with their rotation {{so that they}} only show one <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> their parent planet). In contrast, tidal forces on the irregular satellites are negligible given their distance from the planet, and rotation periods {{in the range of}} only ten hours have been measured for the biggest moons Himalia, Phoebe and Nereid (to compare with their orbital periods of hundreds of days). Such rotation rates are in the same range that is typical for asteroids.|$|E
25|$|Sweyn Forkbeard {{tried to}} wrest {{control of the}} church in Denmark away from the Holy Roman Empire and as a result was slandered by German historians of his day. He has been accused of {{relapsing}} from his Christian beliefs and persecuting Christians in England. In fact Sweyn gave land to the large cathedral at Lund to pay for the maintenance of the chapter. His army destroyed Christian churches in England as part of his invasion following the St. Brice's Day massacre of Danes organized by Aethelred. But when Sweyn became King of England and of Denmark, politics required that he show a kinder <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> the church which had opposed him.|$|E
25|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation, {{meaning that}} it keeps the same <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> Earth at all times. This synchronous rotation is only true on average, because the Moon's orbit has a definite eccentricity. As a result, the angular velocity of the Moon varies as it orbits Earth and hence is not always equal to the Moon's rotational velocity. When the Moon is at its perigee, its rotation is slower than its orbital motion, and this allows us to see up to eight degrees of longitude of its eastern (right) far side. Conversely, when the Moon reaches its apogee, its rotation is faster than its orbital motion and this reveals eight degrees of longitude of its western (left) far side. This {{is referred to as}} longitudinal libration.|$|E

25|$|Shirley MacLaine {{appeared}} in the 1958 film Some Came Running along with Sinatra and Martin. She had a major role (and Sinatra a cameo) in the 1956 Oscar-winning film Around the World in 80 Days. MacLaine played a Hindu princess who is rescued by, and falls in love with, original Rat Pack associate David Niven, and Sinatra had a non-speaking, non-singing role as a piano player in a saloon, whose identity is concealed from the viewer until he turns his <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> the camera during a scene featuring Marlene Dietrich and George Raft. MacLaine appeared alongside Sinatra in the 1960 film Can-Can. She also had an appearance in the 1960 film Ocean's 11 as a drunken woman. The 1984 film Cannonball Run II, with MacLaine, marked the final time members of the Rat Pack shared theatrical screen-time together.|$|E

2500|$|The brass section usually {{includes}} trumpets or cornets; French horns, alto horns, or mellophones; tenor trombones; {{baritone horns}} or euphoniums; and tubas or sousaphones. E♭soprano cornets are sometimes used to supplement or replace the high woodwinds, while the mellophone often {{is used in}} place of the French horn. Some especially large bands use flugelhorns and bass trombones. Specially designed versions of the lower brass have been created for use while marching. [...] These are typically wrapped {{in such a way that}} allow the bell to <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> the audience at all times. [...] Bands may also modify their instrumentation to remove slide trombones completely and replace them with another instrument, such as a valved trombone or marching baritone horn.|$|E

2500|$|Suddenly, Batra {{realized}} {{that one of}} his men had been shot. Turning his <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> Subedar Raghunath Singh, who was sitting behind a nearby boulder, maintaining an iron grip on his AK-47, Batra shouted above the din of flying bullets: [...] "Aap aur main usko evacuate karenge," [...] (We wil evacuate him, you and I). With bullets flying around him, he pushed the JCO toward the safer side and taking his place instead, saying: [...] "You have a family and children to go back to, I'm not even married. Main sar ki taraf rahunga aur aap paanv uthayenge" [...] (I will take the head and you take his feet). Batra courageously exposed himself to enemy fire to drag the injured soldier to safety, and in the process was shot in the chest by an enemy sniper from very close range and a split-second later, by a splinter from an RPG which hit him in the head. Captain Batra collapsed next to the injured soldier, succumbing to the fatal wounds.|$|E
2500|$|Mounds {{range from}} small to large, {{measuring}} [...] in height and [...] in diameter with no visible entrances. Workers are {{only able to}} access their nests {{by a series of}} subterranean tunnels that protrude from the central region. Constructed from soil, mounds are oriented so that the long portions of the mound <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> the sun during the early morning and before sunset. Mounds are usually oval-shaped with the long axis of the nest orientating itself in a north-south direction. These ants also spend large amounts of energy in nest construction and transporting brood, which is related with thermoregulation. The brood is transported to areas where temperatures are high; workers track temperature patterns of the mound and do not rely on behavioural habits. Inside nests, mounds contain a series of narrow horizontal tunnels, with subterranean shafts and nodes reaching grass roots [...] below the surface; these shafts and nodes connect the mound tunnels to the subterranean chambers. These chambers are about 5cm2 (0.77 inch2) and reach depths of [...] The mean number of ants in a single subterranean chamber is around 200.|$|E
2500|$|The paratroopers {{concluded}} {{that they would not}} be rescued, and that the Egyptians would not take prisoners. Some of them contemplated committing suicide before the Egyptians broke in. At 2:00 AM, Gonen called, asked for Amit, and ordered him [...] "Move out. Report implementation in ten minutes. Out". Amit woke Yoffe up and Yoffe agreed that moving out would be the best solution. Yoffe got up and tried to make a few steps before saying [...] "I can't walk". Other wounded men got up to see if they could. Amit ordered his men out, two of whom had to be carried out on stretchers, while some had to be supported by others. They came out under artillery cover, with the leading squad not carrying any wounded. They did not follow Gonen's route, instead opting to go north across the broad avenue and then turn left on a parallel side street. They could not move quietly because of broken glass and other debris. Egyptian soldiers passed by several times, occasionally passing through gaps in the column, but did not challenge them, perhaps believing they were Egyptians. After almost two hours, they reached the Sweetwater Canal, outside the area under Egyptian control. They followed its inner <b>face</b> <b>toward</b> a vehicular bridge marked on the map, but a few score yards before it they reached a railroad bridge, which did not appear on the map. They could hear that the vehicular bridge was guarded by Egyptians, but the railroad bridge was not and they crossed it. Shortly before dawn, they reached Keren's force outside the city.|$|E
