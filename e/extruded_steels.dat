40|$|AbstractPowder Metallurgy (P/M) is an {{established}} manufacturing process allows components of complex geometries with tailor-made strength and high tolerances {{to be produced}} in one single operation without subsequent machining resulting in low cost and low environmental impact. Thus, it has replaced all traditional methods of metal forming operations because of added advantages like lesser energy consumption, maximum material utilization, low relative material wastage, and competitive cost. Sintered low alloy steels find numerous applications in making components for machine parts, automobile parts, structural components, etc. Properties and microstructures obtained using P/M that can’t be obtained by alternative metal working techniques. The final density of the sintered P/M parts plays {{a vital role in}} determining the component properties and characteristics. In the present study, an attempt has been made to investigate the dry sliding wear characteristics of sintered/hot <b>extruded</b> P/M alloy <b>steels</b> with Fe- 1 % C as base material, W (Tungsten) and Ti (Titanium) as alloying elements. The wear behavior of the sintered/hot extruded performs were studied under dry sliding conditions on pin-on- disc (ASTM G 99) arrangement against EN 38 steel disc of hardness HRC 60 with a constant sliding speed of 2 m/s and at a normal load of 30, 50 and 70 N respectively. The microstructure and wear regime of <b>extruded</b> P/M <b>steels</b> has been systematically characterized to understand the structure-property relationships using both optical microscopy and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Addition of W and Ti significantly enhances the wear resistance of the extruded P/M plain carbon alloy steel due to the presence of WC (tungsten carbide) and TiC (titanium carbide). The microstructure reveals a combination of Widmanstatten type ferrite on both the <b>extruded</b> P/M <b>steels.</b> Coefficient of friction is slightly higher due to presence of second phase hard WC in tungsten alloyed plain carbon steel.

25|$|In 1950, Ugine Séjournet, of France, {{invented a}} process which uses glass as a {{lubricant}} for <b>extruding</b> <b>steel.</b> The Ugine-Sejournet, or Sejournet, process is now used for other materials that have melting temperatures higher than steel or that require a narrow range of temperatures to extrude, such as the platinum-iridium alloy used to make kilogram mass standards. The process starts by heating the materials to the extruding temperature and then rolling it in glass powder. The glass melts and forms a thin film, 20 to 30 mils (0.5 to 0.75nbsp&mm), in order to separate it from chamber walls {{and allow it to}} act as a lubricant. A thick solid glass ring that is 0.25 to 0.75 in (6 to 18nbsp&mm) thick is placed in the chamber on the die to lubricate the extrusion as it is forced through the die. A second advantage of this glass ring is its ability to insulate the heat of the billet from the die. The extrusion will have a 1 mil thick layer of glass, which can be easily removed once it cools.|$|R
50|$|As on the ER1, the ER2 car {{bodies are}} of a welded {{all-metal}} semi-monocoque load-bearing design (the entire car body bears all structural loads). The framework is built up from bent and <b>extruded</b> <b>steel</b> profiles, and consists of ring frames which are covered with corrugated sheet steel 1.5-2.5 mm thick. The automatic couplers and their shock absorbers are mounted on short spine beams {{at each end of}} the car. The doors and wire conduits are made of aluminum, which helped to keep the weight down and resulted in the cars being only slightly heavier than those of the ER1. Footboards are fitted under the outside of each door for boarding and alighting to/from low platforms; when boarding/alighting passengers to/from high platforms, these are covered by metal aprons (gap fillers). The end bulkheads of each car (except for the head end of the driving trailer, which is occupied by the engineer's cab) incorporate swing-down transfer platforms which allow passengers to walk between cars; these also damp the cars' pitching motion when the train is moving. The cars are 19.600 m long and 3480 mm wide. The power cars weigh 54.6 t, the driving trailers 40.9 t, and the intermediate trailers 38.3 t.|$|R

40|$|Culture and a Connection In the Spanish {{province}} of Asturias, many homes {{built in the}} 16 th and 17 th centuries are constructed of dry-stacked stone and large timbers for floor joists, rafters, decking. They are topped with large, irregularly shaped roof slates. Alongside many of these homes stands a rectangular granary called a cabazo. The cabazo, similarly constructed, is a stand-alone structure about twenty feet tall, six feet wide and twenty feet long. The main portion, (the storage area), stands ten {{feet off the ground}} atop two large, tapered columns. The upper level is typically separated form the lower level by a massive flat, horizontal stone that protrudes past the face of the columns. This one stone is the floor of the granary. The height above the ground and the continuous flat stone keep the food dry and safe from animals. The stone of the columns, quarried from nearby hills, consists of pieces as small as driveway gravel and as large as shoeboxes. Even though they were built of varying size stones the builders created large, extremely flat vertical planes. Two beams, roughly hewn from chestnut logs, span one column to the next, and support the storage area and roof. These curious structures, born from utility and perched on the hills of the Asturias countryside, have become local cultural icons. A record of visible human participation is left in the traces and details made by the tools of the workmen who built these cabazos. The traces make the connection between the structure and the hand of man, an immediate expression of the granary’s essence and thus {{an integral part of the}} local culture. The industrial age introduced powerful machinery into the tool set of the designer. <b>Extruded</b> <b>steel</b> and reinforced concrete enable designers to create monumental structures within relatively short periods of time. Although the advent of these methods signaled the loss of the record of human participation, the hand of man was also lost in the repetition and redundancy found on the factory floor. The scale of the effort was hidden and diluted by the machinery used to construct the modern forms. The absence of visible traces of the men who built the structures creates a disconnect between humans and the built environment. It is not feasible to go back to creating homes by stacking stones together or using hand tools to construct office buildings, but the materials that are produced by factories can become a new source of raw materials for designer and builder in a way that engages the craftsman. I believe that through the careful use of technology and materials, as well as the inclusion of the craftsman, an environment can be created that extends beyond formal appreciation and expresses a deeper connection between man, culture, and the built environment...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the influence of}} the microstructure (coming from the chemical composition and extrusion shape) of 9 and 14 %Cr- W(Mo) -Ti-Y 2 O 3 ODS steels prepared by mechanical alloying and subsequent hot-extrusion on their impact properties. The chemical composition and corresponding microstructure plays a major role on the impact properties. 9 Cr- 2 W ferritic-martensitic steel present lower upper shelf energy (USE) about 7 J and a lower ductile to brittle transition temperature (DBTT) about - 30 °C compared to 14 Cr- 1 W ferritic steel one. The transition energy curves of low-activation ferritic 14 Cr- 1 W ODS steel was shifted by about 50 °C toward lower temperatures and USE by about 4 J towards higher energies. The extrusion shape also plays a role on the impact properties. The texture caused by the forming process strongly influenced the impact behaviour of the steels.

50|$|The IFR uses {{metal alloy}} fuel (uranium/plutonium/zirconium) {{which is a}} good {{conductor}} of heat, unlike the LWR's (and even some fast breeder reactors') uranium oxide which is a poor conductor of heat and reaches high temperatures at the center of fuel pellets. The IFR also has a smaller volume of fuel, since the fissile material is diluted with fertile material by a ratio of 5 or less, compared to about 30 for LWR fuel. The IFR core requires more heat removal per core volume during operation than the LWR core; but on the other hand, after a shutdown, there is far less trapped heat that is still diffusing out and needs to be removed. However, decay heat generation from short-lived fission products and actinides is comparable in both cases, starting at a high level and decreasing with time elapsed after shutdown. The high volume of liquid sodium primary coolant in the pool configuration is designed to absorb decay heat without reaching fuel melting temperature. The primary sodium pumps are designed with flywheels so they will coast down slowly (90 seconds) if power is removed. This coast-down further aids core cooling upon shutdown. If the primary cooling loop were to be somehow suddenly stopped, or if the control rods were suddenly removed, the metal fuel can melt as accidentally demonstrated in EBR-I, however the melting fuel is then <b>extruded</b> up the <b>steel</b> fuel cladding tubes and out of the active core region leading to permanent reactor shutdown and no further fission heat generation or fuel melting. With metal fuel, the cladding is not breached and no radioactivity is released even in extreme overpower transients.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1986 The {{purpose of}} this study was to provide the USDA-Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and other {{agencies}} or industries that may deal with temporary and intermittent use roads with the necessary background information for the identification, economic evaluation, and selection of the alternate surfacing systems and to determine the applicability and cost effectiveness of each system compared with crushed aggregate roads. Alternate systems considered include those which: 1) are capable of being moved as the hauling or mining activity moves, 2) degrade after use, and 3) significantly reduce the amount of rock required. A comprehensive market and literature search was performed. Potential surfacing types identified in this study are biodegradable materials, chemical stabilization, geotextile or geogrid separation, marginal aggregates, sand-sealed subgrade, metal mats, reusable aggregate with or without geotextile separation, membrane-encapsulated soil layer (MESL), and Geoweb stabilization. Numerous properties of these materials are evaluated, including size, weight, cost, expected performance, mechanical properties, and availability. A two-step evaluation procedure is developed. First is the preliminary evaluation step, which screens various alternate materials based on their characteristics, limitations, and availability. The second step is economic evaluation, which determines the most feasible economical alternatives. Two examples are analyzed to describe the evaluation procedure. The results of this analysis indicate that alternate surfacings can be economical compared to aggregate in most situations. A probabilistic approach using the Beta estimation procedure is recommended for the analysis and evaluation of the uncertainty associated with various elements of the alternate surfacings. Furthermore, a detailed sensitivity analysis is performed for crushed aggregate and soil stabilization surfaces.
