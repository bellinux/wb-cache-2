The effects of pH and NaCl concentration {{on some of}} these functional properties were also investigated. Emulsification, foam capacity and nitrogen solubility were pH-dependent with minimum values at pH 4. Addition of NaCl up to 0. 4 M improved emulsification capacity of both raw and <b>heat</b> <b>processed</b> flours whereas a decrease was observed in foam capacity after 0. 2 M.

This can be done using the heat content of the material which is normal expressed in KW hours per tonne the weight of metal to be processed and the time cycle. Once this has been established other factors such as radiated losses from the component, coil losses and other system losses need to be factored in. Traditionally this process involved lengthy and complex calculations in conjunction with a mixture of practical experience and empirical formula.

25|$|The {{rainfall}} inhibition and the dissipation {{of cloud}} cover are most accentuated over the eastern {{section of the}} Sahara rather than the western. The prevailing air mass lying above the Sahara is the continental tropical (cT) air mass, which is hot and dry. Hot, dry air masses primarily form over the North-African desert from the heating of the vast continental land area, and it affects the whole desert {{during most of the}} year. Because of this extreme <b>heating</b> <b>process,</b> a thermal low is usually noticed near the surface, and is the strongest and the most developed during the summertime. The Sahara High represents the eastern continental extension of the Azores High, centered over the North Atlantic Ocean. The subsidence of the Sahara High nearly reaches the ground during the coolest part of the year while it is confined to the upper troposphere during the hottest periods.|$|E

The first temperature measurements had a standard deviation of 30°C from the brightness temperature, but due to the small sample size was estimated to be 50°C with the possibility that the true temperature of the sample being was 200°C higher than that of the brightness measurement. Spectrometry of the incandescent light became the next method of temperature measurement used in Bassett's group. The energy of the emitted radiation could be compared to known black body radiation spectra to derive a temperature. Calibration of these systems is done with published melting points or melting points as measured by resistive heating.|$|E

500|$|The {{technique}} of reborning a play doll typically involves {{a number of}} steps. To begin the doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed. Then a blue color wash may be applied to {{give the appearance of}} realistic baby skin undertones. For dolls with an awake appearance eyes must be replaced. The outer layer of the vinyl doll is given its skin tone by adding dozens of layers of flesh colored paint. If heat set paints are used, the doll parts must be heat set by baking them inside an oven or by using a heatgun after each layer of paint is applied. Lighter skin tone dolls can take 15 to 30 layers. The effects of the blue color wash combined with the outside layers of paint creates the appearance of veins, and gives the doll its newborn mottled look. Manicured nails and opening of the nose holes are other details that are added during this process. [...] There are air dry paints now available to reborn artists, sold under several brand names.
