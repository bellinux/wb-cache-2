The Committee Against Investment in South Africa (CAISA) and numerous student groups including the Socialist Action Committee, the Black Student Organization and the Gay Students group joined together and succeeded in pressing for the first partial divestment of a U.S. university.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{investment}} {{seems to}} have increased by 5% in the eurozone due to the introduction. Regarding foreign direct investment, a {{study found that the}} intra-eurozone FDI stocks have increased by about 20% during the first four years of the EMU. Concerning the effect on corporate investment, there is evidence that the introduction of the euro has resulted in an increase in investment rates and that it has made it easier for firms to access financing in Europe. The euro has most specifically stimulated investment <b>in</b> <b>companies</b> that come from countries that previously had weak currencies. A study found that the introduction of the euro accounts for 22% of the investment rate after 1998 in countries that previously had a weak currency.|$|E

40|$|Using panel {{data for}} nearly 1, 000 {{companies}} during 1991 to 2000, this paper documents {{that the average}} share of participant's discretionary 401 (k) contributions <b>in</b> <b>company</b> stock was almost 20 percent, and then relates this share to plan design features and firm financial characteristics. We find {{that the number of}} investment alternatives offered, n, and whether the company requires some of the match to be <b>in</b> <b>company</b> stock are key factors of the share of total contributions <b>in</b> <b>company</b> stock. We cannot reject the hypothesis that participants invest 1 /n of their contributions <b>in</b> <b>company</b> stock. <b>In</b> addition, participants do not offset an employer match <b>in</b> <b>company</b> stock with a smaller share of their own contributions to company stock, contrary to efficient diversification. Workers also appear to view other plan restrictions as providing cues about the desirability of purchasing company stock. Thus, plan design is very important in determining the share of 401 (k) assets <b>in</b> <b>company</b> stock. ...|$|R
