5|$|In February 1981, {{the long-standing}} {{operator}} Orpington & District collapsed due to financial difficulties, so Tillingbourne decided {{to launch a}} test operation of three former O services. These proved successful, so more services were added and two new AEC Reliance coaches purchased for the operation. In July 1981, the Orpington operation was given a separate licence, under the name Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited, with six vehicles allocated to it. By 1983, however, {{it became clear that}} the local area management of Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) wanted to develop the business <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> from that of the main company. On 24 September 1983, the Orpington operation's directors, Gary Wood and Peter Larking, bought out the subsidiary to form Metrobus Limited.|$|E

5|$|Most {{bivalves}} are filter feeders, {{using their}} gills to capture particulate food such as phytoplankton from the water. The protobranchs feed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way,</b> scraping detritus from the seabed, {{and this may}} be the original mode of feeding used by all bivalves before the gills became adapted for filter feeding. These primitive bivalves hold on to the substratum with a pair of tentacles {{at the edge of the}} mouth, each of which has a single palp, or flap. The tentacles are covered in mucus, which traps the food, and cilia, which transport the particles back to the palps. These then sort the particles, rejecting those that are unsuitable or too large to digest, and conveying others to the mouth.|$|E
5|$|Mutual {{intelligibility}} {{among these}} ASL varieties is high, and the variation is primarily lexical. For example, {{there are three}} different words for English about in Canadian ASL; the standard way, and two regional variations (Atlantic and Ontario), {{as shown in the}} videos on the right. Variation may also be phonological, meaning that the same sign may be signed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> depending on the region. For example, an extremely common type of variation is between the handshapes /1/, /L/, and /5/ in signs with one handshape.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated {{due to their}} extreme reactivity with commonly used substances, such as water. From their silicate ores, all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way: sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminium(III) ions from the ore (leaching), whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the hydroxide. The remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated selectively; the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride. The result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated. Lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides, with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture. The heavier alkali metals, however, is more typically isolated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way,</b> where a reducing agent (typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals) is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride. The liquid or gaseous product (the alkali metal) then undergoes fractional distillation for purification.|$|E
5|$|The {{region of}} a {{planetary}} system {{adjacent to the}} giant planets will be influenced <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way.</b> In such a region, eccentricities of embryos may become so large that the embryos pass close to a giant planet, which may cause them to be ejected from the system. If all embryos are removed, then no planets will form in this region. An additional consequence is that {{a huge number of}} small planetesimals will remain, because giant planets are incapable of clearing them all out without the help of embryos. The total mass of remaining planetesimals will be small, because cumulative action of the embryos before their ejection and giant planets is still strong enough to remove 99% of the small bodies. Such a region will eventually evolve into an asteroid belt, which is a full analog of the asteroid belt in the Solar System, located from 2 to 4AU from the Sun.|$|E

5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it infeasible. The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> <b>way</b> to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E
