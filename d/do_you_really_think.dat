500|$|When Principal Skinner {{tells the}} {{children}} at school that Valentine's Day is not a joke (due to Bart fabricating candy hearts with mean insults), he has a flashback {{in which he is}} sitting in a PBR somewhere in Da Nang in 1969. On an oil drum next to him is a manila envelope and a photograph of Colonel Kurtz. Skinner sees Johnny, one of his army friends, holding a Valentine card and asks him, [...] "Sending your chick a Valentine?", to which Johnny replies [...] "Yep", right before he is shot to death. Cutting back to the present, Skinner repeatedly calls out Johnny's name in anguish, to which a perplexed Bart states [...] "Cool! I broke his brain." [...] After the episode aired, a Vietnam veteran sent {{in a letter to the}} show that read, [...] "I was watching the Valentine's Day episode of your cartoon and I saw the horrifying Vietnam flashback. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> this was funny, this horrible experience?" [...] The staff ignored the letter and, as Wes Archer pointed out, the scene was [...] "an obvious" [...] reference to Apocalypse Now even featuring characters that resembled Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Mr. Clean (Laurence Fishburne). In contrast, Mark Groening—the brother of Matt Groening and himself a Vietnam veteran—"loved" [...] the sequence as well as the episode.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to her live performances of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] in awards ceremonies and televised shows, the song was included on the set list for her tours The Beyoncé Experience and I Am... World Tour. John Aizlewood of Daily Mail described {{the performance of the}} song during The Beyoncé Experience as [...] "head-spinning". During Beyoncé's performance of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] at a concert in Toronto on August 25, 2007, she had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer denied speculations saying, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the malfunction, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect... 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." [...] During the I Am... World Tour, Beyoncé did not perform the whole song; she sang several of the opening lines of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] after her entrance on stage. During the revue I Am... Yours which {{was a part of the}} tour, Beyoncé performed a jazz medley of [...] "Déjà Vu", [...] "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)" [...] and [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and continued with a full version of the first song. Concert performances of [...] "Déjà Vu" [...] were included on her live albums The Beyoncé Experience Live (2007), [...] (2009) and I Am... World Tour (2010).|$|E
500|$|On July 8, 2007, {{during the}} concert in St. Louis, {{two people in}} the crowd who {{attended}} the show suffered burns after pyrotechnics meant for the stage tumbled into the audience; Knowles visited them in the hospital after the show. During the performance of [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] at the Orlando, Florida show on July 24, Knowles fell down a flight of stairs. Her heel got caught in the bottom on her long coat and she tripped down; she quickly picked herself up and carried on with the show. After the incident Knowles jokingly asked the audience, not to post the footage on YouTube although she knew they would; several clips were posted on the video-sharing website and went viral. On July 26 YouTube removed many of the clips as they were infringing copyright terms. After an initial removal spree, clips of the incident reappeared on YouTube, and were uploaded to other content-sharing websites such as Dailymotion and eBaum's World. A spokesperson for the singer said she was not injured during the fall, which she described as a [...] "mere spot on an otherwise sensational, flawless show" [...] adding, [...] "Miss Knowles picked herself right up, without missing a beat, showing to all that she is the best." [...] When asked about the fall on CNN, Knowles said that she hit her head and chin and was bruised up. She further noted that she immediately started thinking to get up and continue performing the show harder as an athlete due to the adrenaline she had: [...] "Whenever I do something like that I always perform really, really hard cause it makes me little mad at myself so I just go crazy. So they got a really good show in the end." [...] During her performance in Toronto on August 25, while performing [...] "Déjà Vu", Knowles had a wardrobe malfunction as her dress flew over her head and was speculated to reveal her breast. However, a spokesperson for the singer revealed that the speculations weren't true, [...] "She's wearing a flesh-tone bra! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> Beyoncé would go onstage like that?". The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the incidents, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect. A tumble down the stairs onstage in Orlando and a subsequent 'wardrobe malfunction' in Toronto garnered far more attention than was warranted partly because these mistakes contradicted her fiercely athletic style." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, indeed, I did; I {{never saw}} the party there whom I should have liked to {{challenge}} in this way. Why, Tom, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I had come out to Peru to fight a duel on a Sunday morning?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well then," [...] went on Lingard, with {{increasing}} friendliness. [...] "Nothing wrong there. But <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that Hudig was marrying you off and {{giving you a}} house and I don't know what, out of love for you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the second}} half, Mönchengladbach's flurry of shots on goal didn't stop. Heynckes and Carsten Nielsen {{had made it}} 8–0 by the hour mark, at which time Otto Rehhagel had asked Sigfried Held to warm-up {{and get ready to}} go onto the pitch, but Held declined, saying: [...] "Coach, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I can make a {{difference}} to the outcome of the game?" [...] Shortly afterwards, Karl Del'Haye had made the scoreline 9–0.|$|E
2500|$|... "What {{would you}} do? Cut a great road through {{the law to}} get after the Devil? ... And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned round on you – where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's, and if you cut them down – and you're just the man to do it – <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I <b>did</b> {{not care}} for you? I, whose affection for you {{has been a part}} of my very self! I am more grieved than ever. I would never have tormented you if I had not thought you knew my heart was right all the time.' ...|$|R

60|$|GEOFFREY Well, {{it sounds}} perhaps inhospitable, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> know I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I should {{ask you to}} take it away again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, Dave, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> he'll {{have you}} locked up!" [...] burst out his sister, while Jessie's face showed her deep concern.|$|E
6000|$|... "I--I'm {{all right}} now," [...] she faltered. [...] "It--it was such a--a shock. Oh, Sam, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> Tom is bound for Alaska?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's {{difficult}} to tell. It's rather a superb sort of style; and--What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> use to <b>think</b> of your friend?" [...] Atherton broke off to ask.|$|R
2500|$|After the 2002 election, the SPD {{steadily}} lost {{support in}} opinion polls. Many increasingly perceived Schröder's Third Way {{program to be}} a dismantling of the German welfare state. Moreover, Germany's high unemployment rate remained a serious problem for the government. Schröder's tax policies were also unpopular; when the satirical radio show The Gerd Show released [...] "Der Steuersong", featuring Schröder's voice (by impressionist Elmar Brandt) lampooning Germany's indirect taxation with the lyrics [...] "Dog tax, tobacco tax, emissions and environmental tax, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> more weren't coming?", it became Germany's 2002 Christmas No. 1 chart hit and sold over a million copies. The fact that Schröder served on the Volkswagen board (a position that came with his position as minister-president of Lower Saxony) and tended to prefer pro-car policies led to him being nicknamed the [...] "Auto-Kanzler" [...] (car chancellor).|$|R
60|$|THE ELDER MISS WETHERELL. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{they feel}} it more than we do. I found Peggy crying about it yesterday, in the scullery.|$|R

6000|$|The girl blushed a little, {{and looked}} at me. [...] "They were kind to me. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it would please them?" [...] she asked.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{it was a}} headache, Laura?" [...] whispered Belle, {{when the}} two were safe out of earshot {{of any of the}} others.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's not a fair inquiry," [...] said she, smiling {{despite her}} gravity. [...] "I don't mind hearing it--what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> the most correct and proper course for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then, daddy,' said I, 'since I {{can trust}} you, {{and since you}} will tell me what <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> would it be well, if Monmouth's {{standard}} be raised, that I should join it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, Lizzie,' cried Anne, 'you {{are still}} at the old story {{that it is better}} to be wicked than stupid; at least, you reason upon that foundation, though <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>really</b> <b>think</b> so.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, tell me, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{that at all}} times, and in all circumstances, God causes {{events that}} are {{disastrous}} to work out good?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> so?" [...] asked Gus. He {{felt that}} he was {{responsible}} for the craft, as he had taken it from the school boathouse.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} near him," [...] said Patalamon. [...] "He's unlucky. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> he is old Zaharrof come back? I owe {{him for some}} gulls' eggs." ...|$|E
6000|$|Felix came nearer. 'Papa,' he said, 'Mr. Froggatt {{told me that}} if Charlie {{would only}} have taken to the work, he would have done without another man in Smith's place, and got him {{gradually}} into editing the paper too. He said he wished I was not a gentleman's son, for if I had not been so I should have suited him exactly, and should be worth a guinea a week even now. And, Father, <b>do</b> not <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I had better take it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Dear Susan (cried he {{in a tone}} of the {{greatest}} amazement) <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>really</b> <b>think</b> they bear the least resemblance to their Father! He is so very plain!--but I beg your pardon--I had entirely forgotten to whom I was speaking--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Of course, of course,' said Lawford eagerly. 'But {{it is an}} {{absolutely}} new one to me.

6000|$|... "But look here, Mrs. Houseley, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{it makes}} much {{difference}} to a man, {{whether he can}} hold a serious conversation or not?" [...] asked the doctor.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think,</b> Susan," [...] said Anne, looking solemn enough, [...] "that either Myra Murray or I {{could look}} solemn and holy all the time--ALL the time, Susan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> I can come, then?" [...] And Johnny {{stood up}} to try his legs; for he dreaded the long walk, as it seemed to him.|$|E
60|$|HOTCHKISS. Ah, youre {{quoting the}} Baptism service. Thats {{not a bit}} real, you know. If I may say so, you would both feel so much more at peace with yourselves if you would {{acknowledge}} and confess your real convictions. <b>You</b> know <b>you</b> <b>dont</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> a Bishop the equal of a curate, or a lieutenant in a line regiment the equal of a general.|$|R
6000|$|... --Professor Magennis was {{speaking}} to me about you, J. J. O'Molloy said to Stephen. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>really</b> of that hermetic crowd, the opal hush poets: A.

6000|$|Caroline well {{knew this}} was but the way to make Marian still more {{determined}} against it. She held her tongue through all the persuasions {{of her mother and}} Clara; and trusting a little, but not much, to the superior influence which she knew herself to possess, she followed Marian to her room, and began,--"Marian, are you still resolute against this unfortunate archery? because, if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not <b>really</b> <b>think</b> it a matter of right and wrong, I should be very much obliged to you if you would only yield." ...|$|R
