40|$|The {{management}} of the water resources in a canal can be disturbed by the users, if the demand deliveries have been increased because a farmer obtained a greater flow than the scheduled delivery, the watermaster does not know {{the reason why the}} water level decreases at the target points, but the watermaster can know this information because CSI can obtain the unknown <b>flow</b> <b>withdrawn</b> by the farmer. On the other hand, if farmer pumps water from an unknown point in the canal, CSI can obtain the approximate location of this point and the volume of water withdrawn by the farmer. CSI can also define the hydrodynamic state of a canal during a predictive horizon which is very useful in any case, because the hydrodynamic state of a canal is defined from the velocity and water level in each cross-section of the canal. In short, CSI algorithmcan be a useful tool in the {{management of}} a canal. Postprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|Investing in {{financial}} securities inevitably involves risks {{on the one}} hand and opportunities on the other hand. This thesis bundles four different studies on risks and/or opportunities {{in financial}} markets. In one study, we examine the cross-sectional explanatory power of different risk-measures in pricing U. S. stocks and find that investors dislike downside risk. In the second study, we show that conventional short-term reversal strategies exhibit dynamic exposures to systematic risks. Eliminating these risk exposures vastly improves the opportunity to exploit investors’ overreaction exhibited in stock-price movements. Furthermore, this thesis shows that the potential for an ‘active’ manager to add value beyond passively investing in the index is not related to the efficiency of markets. It is, however, positively related to the number of independent investment opportunities, or breadth, available to the active manager. Finally, this thesis provides a study to the behaviour of mutual fund investors subsequent to a replacement of the fund manager. We find that investors perceive turnover of bad performing managers as a bad signal as capital <b>flowing</b> to (<b>withdrawn</b> from) these funds is subsequently lower (higher) ...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1850 s there were high hopes in the Australian colonies that the establishment of government-subsidised steamship mail services between Britain and Australia would regularise the flow of news and hence enable a more predictable and productive economic, political and social engagement between the colonies and the Mother Country. There was also a growing awareness that colonial expansion by European powers and increasing globalisation of shipping and trade meant that wars amongst European states were increasingly likely to have global ramifications. Feelings of insecurity were exacerbated by the irregularity of communication and by the unreliability of much news from overseas. As it turned out, there was little improvement in communication between Britain and Australia throughout the 1850 s. Steamship services, first introduced in 1852, were plagued by technical and commercial failure. Furthermore, the Crimean War had a major impact on services as the demand for troopships it generated diverted steamship resources from the Australian route to the Mediterranean. Just when news from Europe was most eagerly wanted by colonial Australians, the system of mail steamships which promised the long sought for regularity in its <b>flow</b> was <b>withdrawn,</b> replaced for a period by unpredictable sailing packets...|$|R
40|$|Humans have {{strongly}} impacted {{the global}} water cycle, not only water flows but also water storage. We have performed a first global-scale {{analysis of the}} impact of water withdrawals on water storage variations, using the global water resources and use model WaterGAP. This required estimation of fractions of total water withdrawals from groundwater, considering five water use sectors. According to our assessment, the source of 35 % of the water withdrawn worldwide (4300 cubic km/yr during 1998 - 2002) is groundwater. Groundwater contributes 42 %, 36 % and 27 % of water used for irrigation, households and manufacturing, respectively, while we assume that only surface water is used for livestock and for cooling of thermal power plants. Consumptive water use was 1400 cubic km/yr during 1998 - 2002. It is the sum of the net abstraction of 250 cubic km/yr of groundwater (taking into account evapotranspiration and return <b>flows</b> of <b>withdrawn</b> surface water and groundwater) and the net abstraction of 1150 km 3 /yr of surface water. Computed net abstractions indicate, {{for the first time at}} the global scale, where and when human water withdrawals decrease or increase groundwater or surface water storage. In regions with extensive surface water irrigation, such as Southern China, net abstractions from groundwater are negative, i. e. groundwater is recharged by irrigation. The opposite is true for areas dominated by groundwater irrigation, such as in the High Plains aquifer of the central USA, where net abstraction of surface water is negative because return <b>flow</b> of <b>withdrawn</b> groundwater recharges the surface water compartments. In intensively irrigated areas, the amplitude of seasonal total water storage variations is generally increased due to human water use; however, in some areas, it is decreased. For the High Plains aquifer and the whole Mississippi basin, modeled groundwater and total water storage variations were compared with estimates of groundwater storage variations based on groundwater table observations, and with estimates of total water storage variations from the GRACE satellites mission. Due to the difficulty in estimating area-averaged seasonal groundwater storage variations from point observations of groundwater levels, it is uncertain whether WaterGAP underestimates actual variations or not. We conclude that WaterGAP possibly overestimates water withdrawals in the High Plains aquifer where impact of human water use on water storage is readily discernible based on WaterGAP calculations and groundwater observations. No final conclusion can be drawn regarding the possibility of monitoring water withdrawals in the High Plains aquifer using GRACE. For the less intensively irrigated Mississippi basin, observed and modeled seasonal groundwater storage reveals a discernible impact of water withdrawals in the basin, but this is not the case for total water storage such that water withdrawals at the scale of the whole Mississippi basin cannot be monitored by GRACE...|$|R
40|$|Side-type orifice intake {{is a type}} of {{selective}} withdrawal facility used in managing reservoirs to mitigate the negative effects of low-temperature water. Based on the temperature data of a thermal stratified reservoir in China, an experiment was conducted in flume to study the influence of intake <b>flow</b> rate on <b>withdrawn</b> water temperature with different temperature distributions. Results indicated that withdrawn water temperature changed with different flow rates. The temperature change was determined by the water temperature gradients above and below the intake, whereas the change trend of temperature depended on the difference between the water temperature gradient above and below the intake. We likewise proposed a new equation with which the withdrawn water temperature of a thermal stratified reservoir using a side-type orifice could be calculated. These findings could be directly applied to the design and operation of side-type orifice intake in thermal stratified reservoirs...|$|R

In particular, we introduce three main innovations. First, we take a direct measure of cash transactions (the <b>flow</b> of cash <b>withdrawn</b> from bank accounts relative to total noncash payments) as the dependent variable in the money demand equation. This allows us to avoid using the Fisher equation, overcoming two severe critiques to the traditional CDA. Second, we include among covariates two distinct measures of ‘detected’ tax evasion, in place of the tax burden level. Finally, we control also for a new ‘criminal’ component of the shadow economy, considering money demand for illegal activities like drug dealing and prostitution. We propose an application of this ‘modified – CDA’ to a panel of 91 Italian provinces for the years 2005 - 2008. Shadow economy, Currency demand approach, Cash transactions, Evasion, Crime...|$|R
40|$|This note {{deals with}} {{the case of a}} {{principal}} (e. g., a firm's board of directors) which delegates execution of an economic activity to a business unit (or a subsidiary fi rm) managed by a manager. It is assumed that the manager has no control over the cash flows injected into the unit or withdrawn from it: such decisions are made by the principal. The principal aims at measuring the manager's performance in a given interval of time. Neither the Net Present Value (NPV) nor its companion Net Terminal Value (NTV) are appropriate measures for this purpose, because they depend on the cash <b>flows</b> injected and <b>withdrawn</b> by the principal. We introduce the manager's profitability index (MPI), which is invariant under changes in the cash ows, so neutralizing the eff ect on value creation of the principal's decisions. We also break down the project's NTV into two components, which measure the manager's contribution and the principal's contribution to value creation...|$|R

40|$|We {{contribute}} to the debate on how to assess {{the size of the}} underground (or shadow) economy by proposing a reinterpretation of the traditional Currency Demand Approach (CDA) à la Tanzi. In particular, we introduce three main innovations. First, we take a direct measure of the value of cash transactions-the <b>flow</b> of cash <b>withdrawn</b> from bank accounts relative to total non-cash payments-as the dependent variable in the money demand equation. This allows us to avoid unrealistic assumptions on the velocity of money and the absence of any irregular transaction in a given year, overcoming two severe critiques to the traditional CDA. Second, in place of the tax burden level, usually intended as the main motivation for non-compliance, we include among the covariates two direct indicators of detected tax evasion. Finally, we control also for the role of illegal production considering crimes like drug dealing and prostitution, which-jointly with the shadow economy-contributes to the larger aggregate of the non-observed economy and represents a significant component of total cash payments. We propose then an application of this "modified CDA" to a panel of 91 Italian provinces for the years 2005 - 08...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} drop and pressure pulses in the isthmus of the ductus venosus in fetal sheep {{have not been}} measured directly and related to flow. In eight acutely anaesthetized fetal sheep, a 3 F tip pressure transducer (TP) was inserted from the external jugular into the umbilical vein (UV). Ultrasound Doppler flow velocities, TP position and intravenous pressures were recorded in the UV, ductus venosus (DV) and inferior vena cava (IVC) while the TP was <b>withdrawn.</b> <b>Flow</b> was steady in the UV but small pressure fluctuations (< 0. 4 mm Hg) could be detected. Time-averaged {{pressure drop}}ped 1. 9 (0. 5 - 3. 3) mm Hg (mean, 95 % confidence interval) across the DV isthmus. Pressure pulses increased from 1. 7 (1. 2 - 2. 1) mm Hg in the DV to 3. 9 (1. 8 - 6. 0) mm Hg in the IVC. The pressure wave from the heart arrived later (0. 053 sec [0. 025 - 0. 080]) in the isthmus of the DV than in the diaphragmatic IVC indicating a wave velocity of approximately 1. 1 m sec- 1. At all locations, pressures and flow velocities were inversely related. Key word...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the subject of {{monetary}} transmission in Africa. It begins with a report on the effects of the financial crisis of 2008 in Africa. In the countries with more developed financial systems the financial channel proved {{to be the most important}} in transmitting the crisis. In the more peripheral countries the trade channel proved to be the most important. Where countries were able to withstand the global shock coming from the financial crisis they did so with a diversified group of trading partners in fast growing economies. The paper then turns to examine three post crisis institutional developments and asks, how are: a) an increased momentum towards regional integration, b) the rise of Pan African banking and, c) an increase in cross border flows, affecting the monetary transmission mechanism (MTM) in Africa. It is clear from the literature that the rise of Pan African banking and the regionalization thrust of the authorities are deepening the financial channels between countries. But with respect to cross border flows, the huge size of deposits maintained by Africa’s BIS reporting banks suggest relatively low levels of bank intermediation and competition. Thus the benefits that are assumed to accrue as a result of increased cross border <b>flows</b> are <b>withdrawn</b> from the local economy and stored up in the BIS banks. We know large deposits reflect the expectations of the deposit holders. But beyond that very little is known about the role of expectations and the workings of the expectations channel in monetary transmission in Africa. Even less is known about how such expectations would interact with those formed as a result of operations in the large informal sectors which characterise African macro economies. Until research can bridge this gap, the increasing cross border flows with the large deposits held in BIS banks form the basis yet another explanation for the historical weakness of the MTM in Africa...|$|R
