500|$|While Voxs Siddharth Naidu {{thought of}} the film as {{politically}} radical and emotionally raw, Aseem Chhabra called it the least bit political in another editorial for Rediff.com. Freelance journalist Steven Borowiec agreed with the latter idea, writing that [...] "the social context of same sex love in India remains mostly off-screen". Writing for ThinkProgress Ford made note {{of the fact that}} although the socio-political backdrop, [...] "is never explicitly mentioned, it’s alluded to throughout". Addressing the same issue, Saria said that although Loev <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> film, the act of making it was a political one. He said, [...] "hat started out as an intellectual act of protest quickly became something else. Love." [...] Jha, who was largely appreciative of the film, believed that it marked [...] "a new beginning for cinema on unconstitutional love in India".|$|E

500|$|Since {{the decline}} {{and fall of}} {{communism}} in Eastern Europe, the CPC has begun establishing party-to-party relations with non-communist parties. These relations are sought so that the CPC can learn from them. For instance, the CPC has been eager {{to understand how the}} People's Action Party of Singapore (PAP) maintains its total domination over Singaporean politics through its [...] "low-key presence, but total control." [...] According to the CPC's own analysis of Singapore, the PAP's dominance can be explained by its [...] "well-developed social network, which controls constituencies effectively by extending its tentacles deeply into society through branches of government and party-controlled groups." [...] While the CPC accepts that Singapore is a democracy, they view it as a guided democracy led by the PAP. Other differences are, according to the CPC, [...] "that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> party based on the working class—instead it is a political party of the elite ... It is also a political party of the parliamentary system, not a revolutionary party." [...] Other parties which the CPC studies and maintains strong party-to-party relations with are the United Malays National Organisation, which has ruled Malaysia democratically since 1957, and the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan, which dominated Japanese politics for over five uninterrupted decades.|$|E
500|$|The Other Hand {{presents}} {{a critique of}} the British asylum system and attitude towards asylum-seekers. Cleave feels there exists a [...] "general lethargy" [...] about the way asylum-seekers are treated in Britain, and though he believes he <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> writer, the book begins with an extract from a 2005 UK Home Office publication entitled [...] "United Kingdom: A Journey to Citizenship". The extract reads: [...] "Britain is proud of its tradition of providing a safe haven for people fleeting (sic) persecution and conflict." [...] Cleave questioned: [...] "If a government can't even successfully proof-read such a fundamental document, how seriously can we take its asylum procedure?" [...] In writing The Other Hand, Cleave hoped to [...] "humanise" [...] the issue for readers. Despite discussions of political violence and British Colonialism within the novel, Sarah L. Courteau, editor of the Wilson Quarterly commented: [...] "You're almost entirely unaware of its politics because the book doesn't deal in abstractions but in human beings." [...] For this reason, she deemed The Other Hand [...] "the best kind of political novel". Emma Philip of The Courier-Mail has opined that while The Other Hand does make political points, readers should not confuse it with a political book, as the [...] "overwhelming beauty" [...] of the relationship between Sarah, Little Bee and Charlie [...] "far outweighs the political message." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} uses for {{employing}} economic weapons against one country or another. One use for using economic weapons would concern the seller/buyer bargaining on {{the conditions of}} a business contract. This would include price, transportation, timetable for consignment and payment, etc. [...] Although {{this is an example}} of the successful application of food power, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> objective. Another use concerns the economic objectives other than these relating to the transaction of goods; to the general economic policy of the buyer. This would be balance of payments, general problems, such as inflation or taxation and land holding. [...] What distinguishes this from the first is the fact that there is no link between the conditions laid down and the transfer of product. The conditions refer to the economic realm of life. [...] A political use would be one concerning the buyer’s foreign and defense policies. [...] Many believe there is a moral threshold between economy and politics, making the use of economic means for political gains questionable. [...] Examples of the use of economic weapons for political aims are boycotts against certain countries as well as the buying of votes in the UN. A fourth purpose pertains to the basic assumption of the third category: the governments no longer accept each other as legitimate. [...] The economic goals are no longer seen as a means of influencing an opposite government but rather to stimulate opposition and achieve the overthrow or capitulation of the government.|$|E

Most of the advertising in the 2012 presidential campaign was decidedly negative—80% of Obama's ads and 84% of Romney's ads were negative.
