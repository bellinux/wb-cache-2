25|$|The {{windows are}} mullioned and transomed, with {{originally}} {{eight or ten}} lights. The mullions and transoms are in wood and have ovolo mouldings with narrow fillets. Two eight-light windows are believed to date from the 17th century. The High Street bays have modern shop windows to the ground floor. The visible beams are ovolo moulded and feature brattishing, a form of decorative cresting. There is a slate roof, although like the other rebuilt merchants' houses on the High Street, number 46 probably originally had a tiled rather than thatched roof, a sign of wealth that was also an effective protection against the fires that destroyed parts of Hospital Street and Welsh Row in the 17th century. The timber frame uses soffit tenons with diminished <b>haunch,</b> a particularly high-quality type of carpentry joint invented early in the 16th century.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} analyse seismic {{behaviors}} of the <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer floor, carried out the pseudo static testing, which were subjected to vertical loads and horizontal cyclic loads, respectively on two specimens, including the framed short-leg shear wall <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer plane framework and the same dimension unhaunched beam-shaped transfer frame. The test shows that: 1) <b>Haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer structure can apparently improve the shear-bearing-capacity of the abutment section and reduce the beam dimension effectively, and {{it is easier to}} implement the aseismatic design principles, including “strong column and weak beam, strong shearing and weak bend”; 2) if the design is reasonable, <b>haunched</b> beam-shaped transfer structure can get better seismic behavior...|$|R

A subsequent SAC research project [...] has documented, tested and proposed several retrofit solutions for these welded steel moment-resisting connections.

Other scenes feature Mithras ascending behind Sol in the latter's chariot, the deities shaking hands and the two gods at an altar with pieces of meat on a spit or spits. One peculiar scene shows Sol kneeling before Mithras, who holds an object, interpreted either as a Phrygian cap or the <b>haunch</b> of the bull, in his hand.|$|E

Analytical solutions for the boundary stresses are made: using the distance between column center lines as the effective span; using the clear span between columns as the effective span. A comparison is made between the analytical solutions and the photoelastic evaluation. The use of center line distance between columns as the effective span is found to be safe in all frames tested. However, the use of clear span as effective span provides an unconservative estimate in the case of deep, wide <b>haunches...</b>|$|R
