The project focused on the <b>fan-coil</b> <b>unit</b> typical to room air conditioners and many split-system applications. This report presents the accomplishments of the project, including the design, construction, and qualification of an anechoic chamber, the acquisition of acoustic, flow, and pressure data within a <b>fan-coil</b> <b>unit</b> over a typical operating range, and the development of an understanding of the flow-structure interactions responsible for noise generation in the <b>fan-coil</b> <b>unit.</b> This report focuses on the investigation of a method for measuring the dynamic axial force generated by a fan operating in a steady but spatially non-uniform flow field. Several variations of a measurement system that uses a cantilever beam were tested. Experimental results indicated, in all designs, that the measurement system introduced additional sources of axial motion, occurring at the frequencies of interest and at amplitudes much larger than the one to be measured.

40|$|Abstract: Fault {{diagnosis}} {{is an important}} method of improving the safety and reliability of air conditioning systems. When the fan in <b>fan-coil</b> <b>unit</b> is shut down, there are temperature variations in the conditioned space. The heat exchanger efficiency is lower and {{the temperature in the}} room will change while the heat load of the room is stable. In this study, fault data are obtained in an experimental test rig. Thermal parameters as suction pressure and room temperature are selected and measured to establish a characteristic description to represent states of system malfunction. A new approach to fault {{diagnosis is}} presented by using real data from the test rig. Using the artificial neural network (ANN) in self-learning and pattern recognition modes, the fault is di-agnosed with the perceptron (one type of ANN model) suitable for pattern classification problems. The perceptron network is shown to distinguish types of system faults correctly, and to be an artificial neural network architecture especially well suited for fault diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Moisture {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{problems}} in buildings. In spite of the complexity to describe moisture physical phenomena, recent technological improvements have allowed them to be incorporated into building simulation programs. However, it is still unrealistic to predict whole building hygrothermal behavior using CFD models. As a result, the available whole hygrothermal building programs assume the room air to be perfectly mixed, which is a poor assumption for conditioned spaces. To take into account the convective phenomena imposed by mechanical ventilation, we have used an intermediate approach (zonal method) to develop a model library to predict whole hygrothermal behavior in conditioned rooms. In this paper, a zonal library, which includes two models in order to consider building envelope moisture buffering effects, is proposed. It is also discussed how to take into account the dynamic aspect of jet airflow in the zonal method. The zonal library is applied to a case study to show the impact of the external humidity on the whole hygrothermal performance of a room equipped with a vertical <b>fan-coil</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E

The influence of four types of ventilation systems on indoor to outdoor (I/O) ratio of PM 2. 5 concentration was evaluated. The measured {{results show that the}} mean I/O ratio of the seven locations was 0. 36 when the outdoor PM 2. 5 concentration was more than 150 mu g/m(3), and 1. 1 when the outdoor PM 2. 5 concentration was less than 100 mu g/m(3), which implies that people's activities could be the most likely factor rather than outdoor sources for elevated indoor PM 2. 5 levels. The average I/O ratio was 0. 69 for public buildings and 0. 94 for residential homes, which illustrates that indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations could be dominated by outdoor sources for residential homes. Approximately 90 % of the outdoor particles were removed in public buildings equipped with <b>fan-coil</b> <b>unit</b> with air cleaning plus fresh air system.

40|$|Conventional air {{conditioning}} (AC) systems have limited control of sensible cooling and latent cooling capacities; therefore additional energy-consuming devices, i. e. electric heaters, {{are often used}} to reheat the conditioned air {{in order to provide}} thermal comfort for the building occupants. Separate sensible and latent cooling (SSLC) AC systems are capable of providing better control of cooling at no extra overload in the form of energy input. Moreover, because of a higher coefficient of performance (COP) in the sensible cooling cycle, the SSLC technology reduces total energy input to vapor compression systems (VCS), and makes AC systems more energy efficient. This dissertation explores and compares two main methods for implementing the SSLC concept: cycle options for SSLC systems and methods of indoor heat transfer. One of these options consists of two independent VCS, and the other consists of one VCS removing sensible load only and one solid desiccant wheel (DW) regenerated with the waste heat from the VCS. The objectives of the system option study are to understand the reasons behind energy savings and explore the best possible configurations of SSLC systems in different summer outdoor conditions. The simulation results of the first kind of SSLC system show that the energy savings come from a reduced compressor power input of the sensible cycle. Under wide ranging ambient conditions, the amount of energy savings varies from 22 % to 50 % over conventional system energy input. However, such a system has limited independence of varying sensible to latent load ratio and the extra cost of an internal heat exchanger. The integration of VCS and DW overcomes these limitations. An experimental setup was constructed in an environmental chamber to test the performance of the second kind of SSLC system using carbon dioxide as refrigerant. The experimental results show only a 7 % improvement by using SSLC systems, and two negative factors hindering SSLC systems from achieving more energy savings were later identified. As a result, the application of divided heat exchangers is proposed as a solution to address one of the issues. An optimal SSLC system, which incorporates the application of divided heat exchangers, an enthalpy wheel and other energy-saving methods, was modeled and demonstrated a doubling of the COP as compared to a conventional AC system. The second method crucial to implementing SSLC is a so called "low &# 916;T indoor heat exchanger" which is being introduced as an improved sensible heat exchanger design for the successful implementation of SSLC system concept. Its capability of providing both radiative heat transfer and convective heat transfer leads to better thermal comfort to occupants. Compared to the baseline <b>fan-coil</b> <b>unit,</b> the low &# 916;T indoor heat exchanger creates better thermal comfort in terms of reducing temperature stratification from head to feet by 0. 8 K and providing higher operative temperature at the foot level in winter. Numerical models were developed to simulate the operative temperature field created by the low &# 916;T indoor heat exchanger. The model had only an average deviation of 0. 4 K compared to the experimental data. The air temperature simulation in the model was later replaced by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method. The POD method provides simulation results almost identical to CFD simulation (maximum deviation of 0. 1 K), and moreover reduces the computation time from 24 hours to only minutes...|$|E

50|$|However, {{with both}} variable- and constant-flow systems, fully {{automatic}} balancing {{can enhance the}} performance of the HVAC system, eliminating any problems caused by high or excessive system pressures, including noise from the valves and, ultimately, poor control of room temperature. The way the system is balanced will also {{have a major impact on}} energy usage, by minimising pumping costs. In variable-flow systems the use of combination valves, when fitted with a 0 to 10 V, 3 point or thermal motor, integrates the three functions of motorised control valve, differential pressure control valve and a double-regulating valve commissioning set into one product. Applications for this type of product include the control of <b>fan-coil</b> <b>units,</b> chilled beams and air-handling units in variable-volume heating and cooling systems and the control of secondary flow on plate heat exchangers. This integrated approach significantly reduces installation and commissioning costs, since the three control functions are specifically matched to ensure optimum system performance and only one valve has to be mounted in the system instead of three. The problem of high and varying pressure drops across traditional 2-port control valves is also effectively eliminated, ensuring a control-valve authority of 100%. It also saves on space, an important concern in, for example, air handling unit installations where the available plant room space for valve installation is often severely restricted.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Water based, surface {{embedded}} {{heating and}} cooling systems, {{also referred to as}} radiant heating cooling systems (RHCS), are growing in popularity, due to their advantages in terms of low-noise, uniform temperature distribution, and energy saving potential. However, it is in general recognized that traditional control systems may deteriorate the energy performance of radiant systems, so {{that it is important to}} devise ad hoc strategies for such kind of systems. In this paper, a model-based approach is used to design an efficient control architecture for radiant heating/cooling systems coupled with <b>fan-coil</b> <b>units</b> with the main objective of increasing both thermal comfort for building occupants and energy saving. A building lumped parameter model for hygrothermal analysis coupled with a 2 D discretization scheme for radiant heating/cooling systems is development in the Matlab/Simulink environment.

40|$|A {{chilled water}} circuit design that can {{facilitate}} expeditious in situ chiller performance measurement {{has been adopted}} in a chiller plant and its effectiveness has been demonstrated. Before chiller tests commenced, the measurement accuracies of the sensors in the plant were checked by simple measurements and {{an analysis of the}} plant operation records. The analysis unveiled that the chilled water flow rate through the chillers was lower than the design flow rate and the chilled water return temperature often stayed below the design level due to excessive flow rate demand, which would hinder full load tests on the chillers. After the causes of the problems were diagnosed and the problems resolved as far as possible, measurement of the full- and part-load performance of the newly installed chillers was successfully conducted. This work demonstrated that the chilled water circuit design is effective in facilitating expeditious in situ chiller performance measurement but its use requires a properly functioning chilled water system. Practical applications: As the results presented in the paper show, the proposed chilled water circuit design is effective in reducing the time and effort required for measurement and verification of the full- and part-load performance of water chillers. This, in turn, allows more frequent chiller performance measurements to be made for detecting system or sensor faults and deterioration in chiller performance, which would help upkeep chiller energy efficiency and reliability.

This study presents a simulation on evaluating various energy saving benefits of different DOAS configurations among diverse climate zones of commercial buildings in the United States. Three DOAS configurations in a medium office building are simulated in this study: (1) <b>fan-coil</b> <b>units</b> (FCUs) as terminal units with a DOAS unit supplying conditioned outdoor air (OA) to each FCU intake; (2) FCUs with a DOAS unit supplying conditioned OA directly to each occupied space; and (3) a DOAS with active chilled beams. A baseline system consisting of a conventional Variable Air Volume (VAV) system was also simulated for comparison to the three selected DOAS configurations. All simulation inputs are recommended by Department of Energy (DOE) benchmark reference models. Validations of the baseline system and three selected DOAS configurations are based on and compared to previous studies in literature. Building energy simulation results were collected for each system listed above. Additionally, two energy comparisons were performed: each DOAS configuration was compared with the baseline system, and a comparison of each DOAS configuration to the other DOAS configurations was made. Comparison of the simulation results indicates that DOAS energy savings ranged from 7. 1 % to 26 % between the seven simulated locations when compared to simulated baseline with some DOAS configurations performing better in particular climate. The major energy savings are accomplished due to DOAS requiring the exact amount of ventilation for each space and employing high efficiency local Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) units. Suggestions given {{as a result of}} this study include: (1) consider supplying the conditioned OA directly to each occupied space with a DOAS in all simulated locations, and (2) consider employing active chilled beams as the local terminal HVAC units in locations which experience extreme hot summers, such as Miami and Phoenix.

50|$|A chiller is a {{refrigeration}} unit designed to produce cool (chilled) water for space cooling purposes.The chilled water is then circulated {{to one or}} more cooling coils located in air handling <b>units,</b> <b>fan-coils,</b> or induction <b>units.</b> Chilled water distribution is not constrained by the 100 foot separation limit that applies to DX systems, thus chilled water-based cooling systems are typically used in larger buildings. Capacity control in a chilled water system is usually achieved through modulation of water flow through the coils; thus, multiple coils may be served from a single chiller without compromising control of any individual unit.Chillers may operate on either the vapor compression principle or the absorption principle. Vapor compression chillers may utilize reciprocating, centrifugal, screw, or rotary compressor configurations. Reciprocating chillers are commonly used for capacities below 200 tons; centrifugal chillers are normally used to provide higher capacities; rotary and screw chillers are less commonly used, but are not rare. Heat rejection from a chiller may be by way of an air-cooled condenser or a cooling tower (both discussed below). Vapor compression chillers may be bundled with an air-cooled condenser to provide a packaged chiller, which would be installed outside of the building envelope. Vapor compression chillers may also be designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit; normally such a chiller would be installed in an enclosed central plant space. Absorption chillers are designed to be installed separate from the condensing unit.|$|R
40|$|Autumn QuarterThe {{majority}} of the Autumn Quarter was spent developing a suitable program. This was impeded {{by the lack of}} specific verbage both from Dr. Michael and the Office of Extended Services, and the lack of data on the subject of Continuing Education for research purposes. The client had only an approximate idea of what he wanted, and could be specific in only the number of residential units and administrative offices. The site analysis was again hindered by lack of information. The size of the site was much larger than was needed, making it difficult to do detailed research. The schematics done during this period established the basic relationships, both horizontal and vertical, between general spatial categories. Winter QuarterAfter investigating various organizations it was decided that a lineal design was most appropriate. A strong central circulation spine would enable many differing spatial types and functions to be related to one another. In addition, mechanical systems and services would have their horizontal movement concentrated in this core. The initial scheme at mid-quarter was essentially linear with a series of activity nodes along the central spine. The spine was bent for the following reasons: 1. to provide closer physical relationships between the terminal areas of the spine; 2. to provide segregation of various spatial groups in terms of noise; and 3. to provide a semi-enclosed outdoor area. After re-examining the initial scheme, other lineal schemes were investigated. The lower twenty-acre portion of the site was decided the best location and more defined circulation and site zoning concepts were developed. The residential sector of the program, primarily because of privacy, was imposed over the other activity areas, and various schemes evolved. The final scheme incorporated a central spine terminated by entrances and registration areas for out of town and community and university participants. Administrative spaces, laboratories and studios, were organized {{on the north side of}} the spine; and the dining, recreation, and remaining conference and learning areas, on the south. Residential spaces were arranged on a single-loaded corridor. The corridor related to the spine and the rooms received southern sunlight. The auditorium and resource center are centrally located as is the service entrance. Spring QuarterThe largest part of the spring was expended in developing the mechanical, electrical and structural systems for the building. The heating system is a high velocity air system with air handling units distributed in the two central and two terminal equipment areas. Fifty-five degree air is supplied at 3000 feet per minute to attenuation/reheat/distribution boxes that are each controlled by separate thermostats. Air is returned at 1500 FPM. The residential floors are air-conditioned by <b>fan-coil</b> <b>units</b> in the individual spaces. The boilers, shillers, domestic hot water and incinerator are located in the central mechanical equipment spaces and two cooling towers are on the auditorium roof. The storm sewer runs along the central core west to the end of the building and south to Bethel Pike. The sanitary sewer comes in at the service entrance from McGalliard joining the building drain which runs along the central core. Electrical service is from the east end of the building and transformer vault, emergency generators and main switchboards are located at the east end of the basement. Panelboards are located in conjunction with the elevator towers and mechanical chases. The structural system consists of reinforced concrete bearing walls and precast concrete deck. The only exception to this is in the auditorium where the roof is framed with long span structural steel bar joists. The bearing walls gain lateral stability at the terminations of the linear core where they are turned out and in the stair and elevator towers where they are turned in and out again at the interior of the central core.
