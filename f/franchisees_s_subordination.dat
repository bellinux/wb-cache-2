The article offers an approach to reconceptualizing the scope of labour protection that is based on an understanding of personal work arrangements and enterprises as activities. It justifies this approach in terms of the goals of labour regulation-responding to market failure, protecting human rights, strengthening social solidarity, and promoting countervailing power...|$|R

The paper draws strongly on the work of dual systems theorists and focuses, in particular, on the concept of the patriarchal mode of production. Empirical evidence of the existence of this mode of production, in both noncapitalist and capitalist societies, is explored. Despite significant cultural variation, a common theme emerges wherein the patriarchal mode of production systematically undermines women 2 ̆ 7 s standards of living while systematically enhancing those of men. Because the patriarchal mode of production is a social construct, however, it is clearly open not only to change but also to total overthrow. The prospects for the achievement of such an overthrow are assessed by focusing upon current trends in the gender division of housework...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} impacts of family policies on the economic position of women in East and West Germany in 1989 - 90. Chapter I reviews and critiques neoclassical and Marxian theories of women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>subordination,</b> focussing on the neoclassical postulate of a joint household utility function {{and the absence of}} a Marxian analysis of reproduction. Chapter II describes and analyzes the specific family policies and policy climates of East and West Germany prior to unification in 1990, providing a brief overview of the history of family policy, women 2 ̆ 7 s employment, and fertility from World War I to the present. Chapter III models the costs of childrearing, state subsidies of childrearing, and the shares of the remaining costs distributed to men and women, using 1989 - 90 data from the German Socio-Economic Panel. Estimated costs include the opportunity costs of women 2 ̆ 7 s earnings and men 2 ̆ 7 s and women 2 ̆ 7 s leisure. Chapter IV uses the same data to compare the effects of family policies on the childbearing choices of women of different marital status, educational backgrounds, incomes, and levels of labor force attachment within each country. Chapter V models the allocation of household work, with a focus on male/female bargaining power in East and West Germany, again using cross-sectional analysis.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{serves as}} a corrective to the general disinterest of Beckett criticism in the political dimension of his oeuvre by examining the traces of community and social systems throughout his plays. The two hierarchical paradigms presented in Waiting for Godot, the relationships of the tramps with Godot and of Lucky with Pozzo, condense in the most minimalist way human being 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>subordination</b> to a social contract and to the intrasocial dynamics of domination and servitude. The tramps 2 ̆ 7 nomadic individualism, which represents an anarchic bias detected in modernist politics, is antithetical to the protocol of social collectivism as it is incarnated by Godot, while Pozzo and Lucky embody power and servitude. Hamm 2 ̆ 7 s “kingdom” in Endgame is Beckett 2 ̆ 7 s microcosmic portrait of postwar Western capitalist society agonized by its own self-destructive drive. An allegory of modern politics, the play, through another paradigm of domination and slavery, not only pursues the problematic apparent in Godot—which is Man 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> double <b>subordination</b> to social collectivism and intrasocial hierarchy—but also illuminates the nature of modern political leadership. Heavily reliant on the autobiographical facts of his own upbringing in Ireland where an oppressive collectivism stifled his individualistic penchant and turned him into an exile on the continent, Beckett in All That Fall returns {{to the subject of}} the Irish ethos seen through an individual 2 ̆ 7 s emotional struggle with an Irish Protestant community. In Happy Days, the trace of the social system is a nostalgic one conjured by memory. In its Edwardian overtone, the system produces a worn out, and hence futile, ideology that prevents the freedom of an individual, pressing her down with coded middle-class femininity. Not I uncovers a psychologically integrated version of the tyranny of the social system, that equates individualism—Mouth 2 ̆ 7 s idiosyncrasy in insisting on the third person instead of assuming the unified selfhood of ‘I’—with social transgression and thus places the subject in a perpetual cycle of punishment, purgation, and social justice. The most political in its intent among all Beckett 2 ̆ 7 s works, Catastrophe, in portraying the dynamics of hegemonic relationships in the theatrical system, crystallizes his hitherto latent interest in individualism tyrannized by the voice of a systematized social collectivism. Privileging the individual over the social collectivity—and thus evidencing his fundamentally modernist roots—Beckett regards systematized human collectiveness as a “yoke” that hinders natural individual liberty. Beckett not only inherits the political anarchism of the modernists, but reasserts it in a body of major dramatic texts. ...|$|R

Some scholars have pointed to identity caucuses {{as a source of}} division in unions, while others have pointed to them as alternatives to traditional unions. The author argues that race and gender caucuses in unions are not a source of division in the labor movement today, nor are they a viable alternative to traditional unions. In spite of the National Labor Relations Act 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>subordination</b> of minority rights to majority rule, the author determines that women and people of color in union-based identity caucuses maintain a strong faith in traditional unions. Using a critical realist approach, the author argues for the importance of identity caucuses in the labor movement from a critical race and feminist perspective, and the need for strong unified unions in the global economic context from a realist perspective. Then, the author looks at the legal environment in which identity caucuses operate, which is dominated by the 2 ̆ 2 exclusive representative 2 ̆ 2 rule (2 ̆ 2 exclusivity 2 ̆ 2) that names the union as the sole bargaining representative for the entire unit certified by the National Labor Relations Board. Through case studies and survey interviews with members of union identity caucuses, the author concludes that members of these groups are not troubled by exclusivity, but they do favor a place for identity caucuses in the labor movement today. Finally, the author examines reforms to federal labor law that might facilitate the existence of union race and gender caucuses in a legal regime of exclusivity...|$|R

This Article focuses on the {{consequences}} of ratification for reproductive rights. Under CEDAW, I argue, the United States would be required to fully assure these rights, including subsidized family planning services and abortion. Part I of this Article describes CEDAW 2 ̆ 7 s broad prohibition against what I call 2 ̆ 7 the reproduction of gender, 2 ̆ 7 including the 2 ̆ 2 sexual division of labor based on biological differences 2 ̆ 2 that historian Gerda Lerner and other feminist scholars identify as the bedrock for women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>subordination.</b> Part II explains why the denial of reproductive rights necessarily reproduces gender hierarchy, whether by the state or by non-state actors. Part III explains how this plays out, internationally and in the United States. It does so by drawing on recent work regarding the fragmentation of international law. This fragmentation has led to the proliferation of national applications. It then situates this law in U. S. constitutional jurisprudence, showing how the argument set out in this Article resonates with the arguments of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Professors Sylvia Law, Reva Siegel and others, to ground reproductive rights in equality, rather than privacy. Efforts to do so under the U. S. Constitution have failed. As this Article demonstrates, CEDAW provides equality on steroids, equality that can do the work necessary to assure reproductive rights...|$|R
40|$|Background:Pakistan is {{a patriarchal}} society where {{men are the}} primary {{authority}} figures and women are subordinate. This has serious implications on women 2 ̆ 7 s and men 2 ̆ 7 s life prospects. Objective: The aim was to explore current gender roles in urban Pakistan, how these are reproduced and maintained and influence men 2 ̆ 7 s and women 2 ̆ 7 s life circumstances. Design: Five focus group discussions were conducted, including 28 women representing employed, unemployed, educated and uneducated women from different socio-economic strata. Manifest and latent content analyses were applied. Findings: Two Major Themes Emerged During Analysis: 2 ̆ 7 Reiteration of gender roles 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Agents of change 2 ̆ 7. The first theme included perceptions of traditional gender roles and how these preserve women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>subordination.</b> The power gradient, with men holding a superior position in relation to women, distinctive features in the culture {{and the role of}} the extended family were considered to interact to suppress women. The second theme included agents of change, where the role of education was prominent as well as the role of mass media. It was further emphasised that the younger generation was more positive to modernisation of gender roles than the elder generation. Conclusions: This study reveals serious gender inequalities and human rights violations against women in the Pakistani society. The unequal gender roles were perceived as static and enforced by structures imbedded in society. Women routinely faced serious restrictions and limitations of autonomy. However, attainment of higher levels of education especially not only for women but also for men was viewed as an agent towards change. Furthermore, mass media was perceived as having a positive role to play in supporting women 2 ̆ 7 s empowerment...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Gender norms {{determine}} {{the status of}} Pakistani women that influence their life including health. In Pakistan, the relationship between gender norms and health of women is crucial yet complex demanding further analysis. This paper: determines the reasons for reiteration of gender roles; describes the societal processes and mechanisms that reproduce and reinforce them; and identifies their repercussions on women 2 ̆ 7 s personality, lives and health especially reproductive health. METHODS: As part of a six-country study titled 2 ̆ 7 Women 2 ̆ 7 s Empowerment in Muslim Contexts 2 ̆ 7, semi-structured group discussions (n[*]=[*] 30) were conducted with women (n[*]=[*] 250) who were selected through snowballing from different age, ethnic and socio-economic categories. Discussion guidelines were used to collect participant 2 ̆ 7 s perceptions about Pakistani women 2 ̆ 7 s: characteristics, powers, aspirations, needs and responsibilities; circumstances these women live in such as opportunities, constraints and risks; and influence of these circumstances on their personality, lifestyle and health. RESULTS: The society studied has constructed a 2 ̆ 7 Model 2 ̆ 7 for women that consider them 2 ̆ 7 Objects 2 ̆ 7 without rights and autonomy. Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>subordination,</b> a prerequisite to ensure compliance to the constructed model, is maintained through allocation of lesser resources, restrictions on mobility, seclusion norms and even violence in cases of resistance. The model determines women 2 ̆ 7 s traits and responsibilities, and establishes parameters for what is legitimate for women, and these have implications for their personality, lifestyle and health, including their reproductive behaviours. CONCLUSION: There is a strong link between women 2 ̆ 7 s autonomy, rights, and health. This demands a gender sensitive and a, right-based approach towards health. In addition to service delivery interventions, strategies are required to counter factors influencing health status and restricting access to and utilization of services.

This study use a qualitative approach with Roland Barthes 2 ̆ 7 semiotic analysis through the staggered system of denotation and connotation. This research is supported by the Hegemonic Masculinity Theory by Robert William Connell and Disciplining Body Theory by Michel Foucault [...] The results of this study indicate that the Men 2 ̆ 7 s Health Indonesia magazine still maintain masculinity value. Men 2 ̆ 7 s Health Indonesia magazine constructs men masculine body as mesomorph. Mesomorphic shape is one that is athletic and muscular with wide shoulders and chest which taper to a comparatively narrower waist, they often have a powerful posture as well.

Men masculine body is disciplined by the discourse of sport and health so this discourse becomes a truth, normality, and considered to be the knowledge that is predominantly used to control the men body in order to become a docile body and eliminate the knowledge that is not deemed the standards of an ideal and healthy body.

40|$|In 1857 Parliament finally {{succumbed to}} public and {{political}} pressure and {{passed a bill}} creating a domestic relations court: the Court for Divorce and Matrimonial Causes. This new court {{for the first time}} in common-law history, combined the following jurisdictions: the ecclesiastical court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction over marital validity and separation; the Chancery court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction over child custody and equitable estates; the common-law court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction over property; and Parliament 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction over divorce and marital settlements. Wives were given the legal right to seek a divorce or judicial separation in a court of law, receive custody of the children of the marriage, and were allowed an order granting them independent property rights. Divorce could now be granted in a single civil court and the costs would be substantially less than a Parliamentary divorce. Such action gave wives almost the same rights as husbands before the new judge. This article combines empirical data from the first decade of the 1858 divorce court with a theoretical critique of the reform of family law all in the context of the historical reform movement. It explores the different kinds of arguments that existed for reform of the law of divorce, child custody, and married women 2 ̆ 7 s property. These nineteenth-century critiques framed the reform debate of the 1850 s and established the parameters within which civil divorce would occur. The article turns to empirical data from the records of the court 2 ̆ 7 s first nine years to explore the extent to which the legal reform answered these stated needs of progressive reformers or frustrated the desires of female petitioners. The data reveal some limited improvement as well as great continuity in women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>subordination</b> within the family. With the evidence of the court 2 ̆ 7 s performance, the article then challenges the historical claims that the shift from coverture to family law benefited women. In discussing the liberalization narrative that posits family law as good for women, the article examines the reform debate and the reform itself as establishing a narrative of law 2 ̆ 7 s innocence in the subordination of women. Professor Wright concludes by suggesting possible implications of the narrative of law 2 ̆ 7 s innocence in contemporary family law and the lives of men and women today...|$|R
40|$|We usually {{associate}} {{police officers}} 2 ̆ 7 dis-identification with {{certain types of}} suspects with the practice of racial profiling - the systematic over policing of whole classes of suspects based on their racial status. Recently, we have seen police officers 2 ̆ 7 dis-identification with certain suspects manifest itself in systematic under policing of those communities - 2 ̆ 2 depolicing. 2 ̆ 2 Depolicing is a police response to criticism of police tactics toward racial minorities. It has two functions: avoiding further racial controversy over police tactics and threatening critics of the police. Nancy Ehrenreich 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Subordination</b> and Symbiosis: Mechanisms of Mutual Support Between Subordinating Systems helps us understand that 2 ̆ 2 beat 2 ̆ 2 police officers are 2 ̆ 2 hybrids 2 ̆ 2 of subordination - class status - and privilege - authority on the street. Officers experience public criticism of racial profiling as a loss of their usual privilege to exert authority in relations with fellow citizens. Depolicing allows officers to exercise their privilege of discretion {{in a way that}} is beyond political control: political authorities cannot punish officers for abuses of Terry discretion if no 2 ̆ 2 stop 2 ̆ 2 reports are filled out. Ehrenreich 2 ̆ 7 s symbiosis theory is especially valuable in providing a framework for understanding the perpetrator 2 ̆ 7 s perspective. I have written this essay, however, because I want to say 2 ̆ 2 yes, and... 2 ̆ 2 The 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 is the need to recognize the importance of cultural context. I argue for incorporating cultural studies into identity theory because it helps us understand how arguments about policing are translated into practices. First, we must understand that the 2 ̆ 2 discourses 2 ̆ 2 cultural studies methodology analyzes are not just a way of talking, but also influence ways of doing. Second, we must understand that discourses are 2 ̆ 2 intertextual 2 ̆ 2; they respond to one another. Third, we must understand how discourses are related to cultural power. Discourses are the means by which individuals or groups convince others to consent to a certain ordering of society. By merging doctrinal analysis, identity theory and cultural studies, we arrive at a series of questions that help us fully understand the practice of depolicing: (1) What social practices does a specific doctrine encourage or discourage? (2) How has the doctrine been translated into practices in specific contexts? (3) Whom does the doctrine affect as practiced in specific cultural contexts? (4) What counter-discourses emerged from the practices? (5) How did the discourses about a doctrine and its effects relate to struggles for cultural power? Calls for reforming depolicing must be sensitive to both the problems and the opportunities created by the answers to those questions...|$|R

40|$|Appeals to {{practices}} are common {{the humanities and}} social sciences. They hold the potential to explain interesting or compelling similarities, insofar as similarities are distributed within a community or group. Why is it that people who fall under the same category, whether men, women, Americans, baseball players, Buddhists, feminists, white people, or others, have interesting similarities, such as similar beliefs, actions, thoughts, foibles, and failings? One attractive answer is that they engage in the same practices. They do the same things, perhaps {{as a result of}} doing things at the same site or setting, or perhaps as a result of being raised in a similar way among members of the same group. In the humanities, appeals to practices often serve as a move to point out diversity among different communities or diversity within the same community. Communities are distinct from one another in part because their members do different things or do things in different ways. The distinct and varied ways in which different communities enact social norms or formulate law, state institutions, and public policy might be explicable in part by the different practices their members are socialized into. Appeals to practices hold the promise of explaining these differences in terms of the different background practices of the groups, cultivated through a kind of cultural isolation or sense of collective identity. In the social sciences, appeals to practices have {{played a central role in}} fundamental theorizing and theory building. Appeals to practices in the social sciences are often much more systematic and theoretical, forming the core of the systematic theories of Pierre Bourdieu and Anthony Giddens in Anthropology and Sociology. Practice theory has thus become a growth industry in social scientific investigation, offering the promise of a central object of investigation that explains both unity and difference within and across communities and groups. But it is unclear just what {{practices are}} and what role, both ontological and explanatory, that practices are supposed to play. The term `practices 2 ̆ 7 is used to pick out a wide range of things, and its relation to other terms, from `tradition 2 ̆ 7 or `paradigm 2 ̆ 7 to `framework 2 ̆ 7 or `presupposition 2 ̆ 7, is unclear. Practices are posited as ubiquitous, yet they are difficult to isolate and pin down. We are all said to participate in them, but they remain hidden. Their role, whether causal, logical, or hermeneutical, remains mysterious. After locating the historical origins of appeals to practices in the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and Martin Heidegger, my dissertation uses Stephen Turner 2 ̆ 7 s broad and systematic critique of appeals to practices to develop a new type of account. My account is a phenomenological account that treats practices as human doings that show up to people in material and social environments and make themselves available for specific responses in those environments. I argue that a phenomenological account is an effective alternative to accounts that treat practices as either shared objects with properties or shared and implicit presuppositions. I use a phenomenological account of practices to treat important debates in feminist philosophy and the philosophy of the social sciences, particularly debates over pornography 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>subordination</b> of women and the classification of mental disorders in psychiatry...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} evaluates Novatian of Rome 2 ̆ 7 s {{theology of}} the Son in his De Trinitate. It argues that Novatian presents the Son as ontologically subordinate to the Father, {{which is not a}} conclusion shared by a majority of recent scholars. This conclusion is reached by comparing Novatian 2 ̆ 7 s presentation of the Father 2 ̆ 7 s divinity with that of the Son. The first half of this work, therefore, demonstrates the manner by which Novatian affirms that the Father is transcendent, supreme, and unique in His attributes. Novatian employs a range of concepts and terms found in Christian and non-Christian sources. Specifically, I present and analyze Novatian 2 ̆ 7 s indebtedness to technical terminology of divine ontology and divine attributes which were common to his intellectual environment, especially in Middle Platonism. I show that Novatian expresses the Father 2 ̆ 7 s transcendence through negative theology, but also acknowledges an array of necessary attributes such as oneness and simplicity. Novatian 2 ̆ 7 s understanding of the Son 2 ̆ 7 s nature depends on his conviction that the Father alone is supreme in all of His divine attributes. The arguments Novatain assembles to identify the Son as God do not suggest that the Son 2 ̆ 7 s divinity is based on the idea of equality with the Father. In some respects, Novatian takes over subordinationist themes in the Word Christology tradition, which was highly influential to his perspective. This study shows that when Novatian turns his attention to a comparison of the Son 2 ̆ 7 s divine nature with that of the Father, his emphasis on the Father 2 ̆ 7 s uniqueness and supremacy act as the lens by which he speaks of the Son 2 ̆ 7 s attributes. Although Novatian embraces the Son 2 ̆ 7 s derivation from the Father in terms of a shared substance (what I identify as an ontological connection/relationship), he consistently speaks of the Son 2 ̆ 7 s attributes as diminished and less than the Father 2 ̆ 7 s. This dissertation attempts to correct the false impression that theological philosophy played a minor role, or no role at all, on Novatian 2 ̆ 7 s thought. Novatian 2 ̆ 7 s {{theology of the}} Son is both consistent and sophisticated because of his articulation of the Son 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> ontological <b>subordination</b> to the Father...|$|R

I found that the passages from the children 2 ̆ 7 s books had much shorter paragraphs, and slightly shorter sentences, T-units, clauses, and words. T-units were the most consistently and notably reduced elements. The children 2 ̆ 7 s books also had more lexical repetition and fewer abstract and Latinate words and tended towards a verbal style. These characteristics support some of the common assumptions about children 2 ̆ 7 s literature, but the differences were slighter than anticipated. In the area of syntax, the assumption that coordination would increase and subordination decrease markedly in the children 2 ̆ 7 s stories did not prove true. Coordination was only marginally more frequent in the children 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> passages, and <b>subordination</b> nearly equal in both sets. The reduction of prepositions in the juvenile samples seems of more significance syntactically. In the children 2 ̆ 7 s passages there are large increases {{in the amount of}} dialogue and in the use of Germanic based words. ^ My general conclusion is that the differences in the children 2 ̆ 7 s passages reflect a stronger tendency towards everyday speech, that children 2 ̆ 7 s authors borrow more conventions from conversation and from oral traditions when writing for a child audience. ...|$|R
40|$|In 1980, a Constitutional Tribunal was {{established}} in Spain. Its ability to exercise the power of constitutional review greatly increased {{the strength of the}} judicial branch in the Spanish political system. This dissertation examines how the addition of this body to the political architecture affected the overall distribution of power in the Spanish democratic system. As part of this study, a detailed analysis is made as well of an often overlooked theoretical issue—the relationship between powerful high courts and the ability of third wave democracies to uphold the supremacy of the constitution. Court decisions affecting the powers of five different governmental institutions are considered: the military, the police, the parliament, the judiciary and the autonomous communities. The general conclusions of this research are that the Constitutional Tribunal has been essential to establishing a state of law in Spain, especially in regards to the protection of citizens 2 ̆ 7 constitutional rights. The existence of the Constitutional Tribunal has been indispensable in implementing the post-transition legal regime because government institutions—the military especially—have been reluctant to cede unconstitutional powers that they held prior to, or were given during, the transition to democracy. Through the tribunal 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> decisions, the <b>subordination</b> of the military to civilian jurisdiction has been finalized. In addition, the antiterrorist campaign has been made to comply with human rights requirements. Furthermore, the parliament has been compelled to subordinate itself to the constitution, thereby ceding its supremacy to a higher law. Court decisions have also altered the Spanish judicial system so that magistrates 2 ̆ 7 sentences comply with the constitution and no longer defer to the other branches of government, thereby ameliorating a common problem found in post-authoritarian civil law systems. Finally, the court has {{played a central role in}} instituting the new federal autonomous community system. As a result, the cases adjudicated by the Constitutional Tribunal have greatly improved the quality of Spanish democracy.

Part Two presents a phenomenological critique of the conception of the human - and thus the female - which underlies radical feminist legal criticism. Again, I will argue that {{in both cases the}} theory does not pay enough attention to feminism: liberal feminist legal theory owes more to liberalism than to feminism and radical feminist legal theory owes more to radicalism than it does to feminism. Both models accept a depiction of human nature which is simply untrue of women. Thus, both accept, uncritically, a claimed correlation between objective condition and subjective reality, which, I will argue, is untrue to women. As a result, both groups fail to address the distinctive quality of women 2 ̆ 7 s subjective, hedonic lives, and the theories they have generated therefore have the potential to backfire - badly - against women 2 ̆ 7 s true interests. In the concluding section I will suggest an alternative normative model for feminist legal criticism which aims neither for choice nor equality, but directly for women 2 ̆ 7 s happiness, and a feminist legal theory which has as its critical focus the felt experience of women 2 ̆ 7 s subjective, hedonic lives. My substantive claim is that women 2 ̆ 7 s happiness or pleasure - as opposed to women 2 ̆ 7 s freedom or equality - should be the ideal toward which feminist legal criticism and reform should be pressed, and that women 2 ̆ 7 s misery, suffering and pain - as opposed to women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> oppression or <b>subordination</b> - is the evil we should resist. I will argue that feminist legal theorists, in short, have paid too much attention to the ideals of equality and autonomy and not enough attention to the hedonistic ideals of happiness and pleasure, and that correlatively we have paid too much attention to the evils of subordination and oppression, and not enough attention to the hedonistic evils of suffering and pain. My methodological assumption is that the key to moral decision-making lies in our capacity to empathize with the pain of others, and thereby resist the source of it, and not in our capacity for abstraction, generalization, or reason. My strategic claim is directly entailed: the major obstacle to achieving the empathic understanding which is the key to significant moral commitment, including the commitment of the legal system to address the causes of women 2 ̆ 7 s suffering, is the striking difference between women 2 ̆ 7 s and men 2 ̆ 7 s internal lives, and more specifically, the different quality of our joys and sorrows. This obstacle can only be overcome through rich description of our internal hedonic lives...|$|R

Copyright and droit d 2 ̆ 7 auteur legal systems are based on different paradigms: the former focus on the protection of the object - the author 2 ̆ 7 s work, while the latter on the protection of the subject - the author, as the creator of the authorial work, which results in differences in the regulation of the right to use authorial works created {{within the framework of}} regular employment. Droit d 2 ̆ 7 auteur legal systems are dominated by the principle of authorship in acquiring the copyright so that, as opposed to the copyright system, investing into the creation of an authorial work, or organising transactions related to the creation of an authorial work, have no legal effect on the establishment of copyright. Legal persons cannot be authors because they have no ability for intellectual creation although they are capable of expressing their will. When an authorial work is created within the framework of employment, the obligation to carry out intellectual work should be distinguished from the obligation to consign the authorial work as a result of intellectual work and the acquisition of the right with the contents which authorize the use of an authorial work. In Croatian law, employment does not mean that the employer has the right to use authorial works created within the framework of employment. In order to acquire the rights to use the contents of an author 2 ̆ 7 s work, the employer needs a special contractual clause providing the basis for the acquisition of the right to use the authorial work, since in the Croatian legal system the employer is not entitled to an authorial work created within the framework of employment. The only exception to this rule is the creation of software as part of the employment duties in which case the employer is entitled to use such software, which is a unique solution in a number of European states, following from the regulations of the EC Directive on the legal protection of computer programs. Employment within the framework of which an authorial work has been created is defined as a relation in which the author is dependent on the employer in terms of salary, work with the employer 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> resources, <b>subordination</b> to the employer 2 ̆ 7 s plans and programmes, place of work and working hours, so that the creation of authorial works is not a result of the author 2 ̆ 7 s independent entrepreneurship. An authorial work made on order is the one which is created as fulfilment of the contract on the creation of author 2 ̆ 7 s work on the basis of which the author is obliged to consign a copy of the authorial work of certain characteristics to the ordering party. By consigning a copy of an authorial work, the ordering party becomes the owner of that copy, but acquires the copyright only if this has been stipulated in this way in the contract or other legal transaction. Unless defined otherwise, the author retains his copyright without limitations. Upon passing of the Law on Copyright and related rights of 2004 there have been major changes in the assignment of ownership of authorial works created within the regular employment in Croatian law. These changes are characterized by greater freedom in the regulation of relations between employers and employees when obligations resulting from regular employment consist of the creation of authorial works on the one hand, and greater commitment in the regulation of these relations on the other. The application of the Law on the use of authorial works created within the framework of regular employment has been postponed for three years, until 30 Oct. 2006. The harmonization with new regulations is carried out by modifications of individual employment contracts, but they can be applied by means of collective contracts or other reciprocal acts regulating relations between employers and employees, and cannot be carried out by one-sided acts by employers, such as employers 2 ̆ 7 statutes, because the employer is not entitled to dispose of the subjective author 2 ̆ 7 s rights.

Neuvostoliiton romahdettua Venäjä on pyrkinyt löytämään uusia tapoja kansallisen yhtenäisyyden ylläpitämiseksi, valtiovallan uudelleen rakentamiseksi ja maan kansainvälisen aseman parantamiseksi. Suomessa puolestaan Euroopan yhdentyminen ja lisääntyvä maahanmuutto ovat asettaneet muutospaineita kansalaisuudelle ja kansalliselle identiteetille. Tästä kontekstista käsin väitöskirjassa kysytään miten peruskoulussa harjoitetun kansalaiskasvatuksen tavoitteet ja sisällöt ovat muuttuneet vastaamaan 1990 - ja 2000 -lukujen sisä- ja ulkopoliittisia muutoksia. Tutkimuksen tutkimusaineiston muodostavat venäläiset ja suomalaiset koulutuspoliittiset asiakirjat sekä kahden kansainvälisen järjestön - Euroopan Neuvoston ja YK:n kasvatus-, tiede- ja kulttuurijärjestön (UNESCO) - viralliset dokumentit. Historiallisista ja yhteiskuntapoliittisista eroistaan huolimatta sekä Suomi että Venäjä antavat edelleen suuren arvon kansalaisuudelle ja kansalliselle identiteetille. Venäjä on 1990 -luvun lopulta lähtien lujittanut kansalaisuuden ja kansallisuuden suhdetta. Valtiovalta korostaa kansalaisten uskollisuutta Venäjän valtiota kohtaan ja alleviivaa tätä kautta keskeistä asemaansa kansalaiskasvatuksen koulutuspolitiikan määrittämisessä. Isänmaallisuuskasvatuksen ohjelmat ovat 2000 -luvun alusta lähtien korostaneet alistumista aktiivisen osallistumisen sekä konsensusta mielipiteiden monimuotoisuuden sijaan. Yksilöllisen identiteetin asemasta etusija annetaan kollektiiviselle identiteetille. Suomi on sen sijaan alkanut purkaa valtion ja kansakunnan vahvaa historiallista sidettä ja painottaa yhä selkeämmin kansallisen identiteetin kulttuurista ulottuvuutta. Tämä kulttuurinen käännös on tullut väistämättömäksi Suomen pyrkiessä säilyttämään kansallisen identiteettinsä ja legitimiteettinsä globalisoituvassa maailmassa. Kansalaisuuden ja kansallisuuden vahvan yhteyden purkaminen avaa mahdollisuuden yhdistää uudella tavalla käsitykset kansalaisuudesta ja kansallisesta identiteetistä. Toisaalta tässäkin mallissa kansallinen taso nähdään ytimenä ja muiden tasojen lähtökohtana. This {{doctoral}} dissertation studies citizenship education policies in Finland and Russia {{in relation to}} the supranational citizenship education rhetoric shaped by two large intergovernmental organizations, the Council of Europe (COE) and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO). The research pursues two broad research aims. First, to understand the supranational agenda of citizenship education, and second, to analyse citizenship education policies in Russia and Finland since the mid 1980 s up to 2007, and to compare them to the supranational agenda of citizenship education. The dissertation is concerned with the macro level and thus the research data comprises policy documents issued by the Russian and Finnish state authorities, and the two intergovernmental organisations. The analysis of policy content draws on the rhetorical and policy-as-discourse approaches in order to elucidate the objectives of citizenship education, as well as the arguments employed to justify the proposed objectives throughout the studied period. Individualising comparison enhances the interpretative task of the dissertation, as it increases the visibility of one national context by contrasting it with another, and therefore helps to find adequate explanations to particular policy outcomes. In selecting Russia and Finland as the two national case studies, the dissertation concentrates on countries embedded in different state models and citizenship traditions. The main motivation behind the selection of the COE and UNESCO is to acknowledge and analyse the rising supranational educational governance, which increasingly provides models for and restrictions on actions and policies at national level. The study is particularly interested in the relationship between the state and citizenship education in public schooling at the time of state (re) formation and nation (re) building. Citizenship education is perceived as a means to legitimise and maintain state power unsettled in periods of political changes. Equally, citizenship education offers a prism through which to examine larger processes in a given society, in particular, changes in the relationship between the state, citizenship and nationality, and possible modifications in the meanings of these essential socio-political categories. For the national cases examined in the dissertation the period since {{the second half of the}} 1980 s has been rich in political changes related to, and leaving their mark on, the state and the nation. Whereas since the collapse of the Soviet regime Russia has striven to find ways to regenerate national cohesion, rebuild statehood and reconsolidate its status in the international arena, Finland has attempted to adjust its national identity and citizenship to European integration and increasing immigration. The analysis of the COE and UNESCO reveals that there is no one modality of citizenship education embraced by the examined supranational actors. On one hand, in clear contrast to the traditional model of citizenship education, they advocate proactive political participation, critical scrutiny of state institutions and action against the state on the basis of universal human rights. They also promote diversity and perceive citizenship as a multilayered concept extending to the local, national, regional and global levels. Instead of linking rights and duties to membership in a territorially demarcated polity of the nation-state, the COE and UNESCO often advocate the notion of human rights and link rights and duties to the global humanity. In this manner, supranational organisations decouple citizenship from nationality and, by doing so, advance the postnationalisation of citizenship. On the other hand, the intergovernmental character of the organisations and their origin embedded in the consolidation of the nation-state system lead to inconsistencies in the agenda and somewhat surprising repetition of the traditional citizenship rhetoric, for instance, in linking society narrowly to the territorially demarcated nation-state. The supranational agenda also continues to emphasise the key role of national governments in implementing citizenship education and therefore still posits the nation-state as a central player in education policy and practice. The Russian case exemplified convergence with the post-national supranational citizenship education rhetoric only during the first half of the 1990 s when the new country leaders did not pay serious attention to regenerating national cohesion and building an all-embracing national identity. In this period, preference was given to the de-legitimation of the Soviet type of political education, and slightly later to the development of citizenship education policies stressing citizens´ rights, knowledge of the legislation and lawful conduct for the purpose of building a constitutional state. In terms of national identity, the authorities advocated a vague category of universal human values and encouraged the re-consolidation of sub-state national identities. Toward the end of the 1990 s, the contents of citizenship education policies shifted radically. The state has re-emphasised its leading role in defining citizenship education policies with the main objective to craft citizens´ loyalty to the Russian state. The programmes of patriotic education, which appeared in the beginning of the 2000 <b>s,</b> prioritise <b>subordination</b> over active participation, consensus over pluralism, duties over rights and collective identity over an individual one. Compared to the mid 1980 s, when citizenship education in Finland was premised on the idea that the vitality of the Finnish nation is invariably linked to the sovereignty of the Finnish state, the latest curricula documents stress national culture as the prime source of national integrity. In its return to a predominantly cultural understanding of the nation, Finland exemplifies the debundling of the state and the nation, and nationality and citizenship. The transformation into a Kulturnation is a necessary step to secure Finland´s national being in a globalising world, which transforms and weakens state sovereignty, without putting the legitimacy of the Finnish nation into question. The decoupling of nationality and citizenship opens up the possibility for a multilayered conceptualisation of both citizenship and nationhood. However, the national still constitutes the core, with the sub- and supranational layers as additional ingredients of the emerging citizenship recipe. Despite major differences in their historical and current socio-political contexts, Russia and Finland continue to attach strong value to national identity and national citizenship. However, whereas Russia, since the late 1990 s, has moved in the direction of state nationalism and a closer bond between the nation and the state, which preclude any possibility for a multilayered conception of citizenship, Finland has forsaken a previously strong link between the state and the nation and seems to be strengthening its cultural identity in peaceful alliance with Europeanness...|$|R
