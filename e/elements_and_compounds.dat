5|$|IUPAC was {{established}} in 1919 as the successor of the International Congress of Applied Chemistry {{for the advancement of}} chemistry. Its members, the National Adhering Organizations, can be national chemistry societies, national academies of sciences, or other bodies representing chemists. There are fifty-four National Adhering Organizations and three Associate National Adhering Organizations. IUPAC's Inter-divisional Committee on Nomenclature and Symbols (IUPAC nomenclature) is the recognized world authority in developing standards for the naming of the chemical <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds.</b> Since its creation, IUPAC has been run by many different committees with different responsibilities. These committees run different projects which include standardizing nomenclature, finding ways to bring chemistry to the world, and publishing works.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactors}} {{were used}} to undertake research related to weapons, such as investigations of the properties of tritium. Wartime experiments included measuring the neutron absorption cross-section of <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds.</b> Albert Wattenberg recalled that about 10 elements were studied each month, and 75 {{over the course of}} a year. An accident involving radium and beryllium powder caused a dangerous drop in his white blood cell count that lasted for three years. As the dangers of things such as inhaling uranium oxide became more apparent, experiments were conducted on the effects of radioactive substances on laboratory test animals.|$|E

50|$|An {{enthalpy}} change {{occurs during}} a chemical reaction. For the special {{case of the}} formation of a compound from the elements, the change is designated ΔHform and is a weak function of temperature. Values of ΔHform are usually given where the <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compound</b> are in their normal standard states, and as such are designated standard heats of formation, as designated by a superscript °. The ΔH°form undergoes discontinuities at a phase transition temperatures of the constituent <b>element(s)</b> <b>and</b> the <b>compound.</b> The enthalpy change for any standard reaction is designated ΔH°rx.|$|R
25|$|Any {{material}} sample contains <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> {{that are}} subject to decay into other <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds.</b> In cases where the rate of decay is predictable and the proportions of initial and end products can be known exactly, consistent dates of the artifact can be calculated. Due {{to the problem of}} sample contamination and variability of the natural proportions of the materials in the media, sample analysis in the case where verification can be checked by grand layering systems has often been found to be widely inaccurate. Chemical dates therefore are only considered reliable used in conjunction with other methods. They are collected in groups of data points that form a pattern when graphed. Isolated dates are not considered reliable.|$|E
25|$|The molten {{reactor core}} {{releases}} volatile <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds.</b> These may be gas phase, such as molecular iodine or noble gases, or condensed aerosol particles {{after leaving the}} high temperature region.

25|$|Biotic {{metabolism}} {{is directly}} {{tied to the}} global cycling of <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> on Earth. The geochemical environment fuels life, which then produces different molecules that go into the external environment. (This is directly relevant to biogeochemistry.) In addition, biochemical reactions are catalyzed by enzymes which sometimes prefer one isotope over others. For example, oxygenic photosynthesis is catalyzed by RuBisCO, which prefers carbon-12 over carbon-13, resulting in carbon isotope fractionation in the rock record.|$|E

25|$|The Phosphoria Formation and its {{equivalents}} of Permian age are {{unlike any}} other Paleozoic rocks because of their extraordinary content of uncommon elements. The formation consists of sandy dolomite, widespread black phosphate beds and black shale that is unusually rich not only in phosphorus, but also in vanadium, uranium, chromium, zinc, selenium, molybdenum, cobalt, and silver. The formation is mined extensively in nearby parts of Idaho and in Wyoming for phosphatic fertilizer, for the chemical element phosphorus, and {{for some of the}} metals that can be derived from the rocks as by-products. These <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> are not everywhere concentrated enough to be of economic interest, but their dollar-value is, in a regional sense, comparable to that of some of the world's greatest mineral deposits.|$|E
25|$|Extraterrestrial oceans may be {{composed}} of water or other <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds.</b> The only confirmed large stable bodies of extraterrestrial surface liquids are the lakes of Titan, although there is evidence {{for the existence of}} oceans elsewhere in the Solar System. Early in their geologic histories, Mars and Venus are theorized to have had large water oceans. The Mars ocean hypothesis suggests that {{nearly a third of the}} surface of Mars was once covered by water, and a runaway greenhouse effect may have boiled away the global ocean of Venus. Compounds such as salts and ammonia dissolved in water lower its freezing point so that water might exist in large quantities in extraterrestrial environments as brine or convecting ice. Unconfirmed oceans are speculated beneath the surface of many dwarf planets and natural satellites; notably, the ocean of Europa is estimated to have over twice the water volume of Earth. The Solar System's giant planets are also thought to have liquid atmospheric layers of yet to be confirmed compositions. Oceans may also exist on exoplanets and exomoons, including surface oceans of liquid water within a circumstellar habitable zone. Ocean planets are a hypothetical type of planet with a surface completely covered with liquid.|$|E

500|$|The first {{solid-state}} device was the [...] "cat's-whisker detector" [...] first {{used in the}} 1900s in radio receivers. A whisker-like wire is placed lightly in contact with a solid crystal (such as a germanium crystal) in order to detect a radio signal by the contact junction effect. In a solid-state component, the current is confined to solid <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> engineered specifically to switch and amplify it.

500|$|Mount Cleveland {{is located}} [...] {{from the western}} end of the Aleutian Arc, a long {{volcanic}} chain extending off the coast of Alaska. Containing over 75 volcanoes, this volcanic arc occurs above the subduction zone where the Pacific Plate plunges under the North American plate. As the plate moves deeper into the earth, the increasing pressure results in the loss of volatiles, certain <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> with low boiling points, from various hydrous minerals. One of these compounds is water; its addition to the mantle wedge formed between the subducting and overriding plates lowers the melting point enough to allow magma to form. The melted material then rises to the surface and forms a volcanoin this case, the Aleutian Arc.|$|E
500|$|In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier {{had written}} Mémoire sur la {{combustion}} en général, {{the first of}} what proved to be a series of attacks on phlogiston theory; it was against these attacks that Priestley responded in 1783. While Priestley accepted parts of Lavoisier's theory, he was unprepared to assent to the major revolutions Lavoisier proposed: the overthrow of phlogiston, a chemistry based conceptually on <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds,</b> and a new chemical nomenclature. Priestley's original experiments on [...] "dephlogisticated air" [...] (oxygen), combustion, and water provided Lavoisier with the data he needed to construct much of his system; yet Priestley never accepted Lavoisier's new theories and continued to defend phlogiston theory {{for the rest of his}} life. Lavoisier's system was based largely on the quantitative concept that mass is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions (i.e., the conservation of mass). By contrast, Priestley preferred to observe qualitative changes in heat, color, and particularly volume. His experiments tested [...] "airs" [...] for [...] "their solubility in water, their power of supporting or extinguishing flame, whether they were respirable, how they behaved with acid and alkaline air, and with nitric oxide and inflammable air, and lastly how they were affected by the electric spark." ...|$|E

2500|$|While both {{explanations}} are probably valid to some extent, {{it is remarkable}} that the first [...] "modern" [...] system of chemical nomenclature appeared {{at the same time as}} the distinction (by Lavoisier) between <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds,</b> in the late eighteenth century.|$|E

Evidence for the change in oxygen levels is that the sediments of the earlier Archean are dark brown and black caused by unoxidized carbon, iron sulfide, and other <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds.</b> As oxygen levels increased in the atmosphere and oceans, the sediments changed. In the late Archean, sediments went through a transitional stage with the banded-iron formations; after this transition they demonstrate an oxygen-rich environment [...] shown by iron oxide-stained siltstones or mudstones called red beds.|$|E

2500|$|Roughly speaking, at the {{distance}} of Saturn, solar insolation and solar wind flux are sufficiently low that <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> that are volatile on the terrestrial planets tend to accumulate in all three phases. Titan's surface temperature is also quite low, about 94K. [...] Consequently, the mass fractions of substances that can become atmospheric constituents are much larger on Titan than on Earth. In fact, current interpretations suggest that only about 50% of Titan's mass is silicates, with the rest consisting primarily of various H2O (water) ices and NH3·H2O (ammonia hydrates). NH3, {{which may be the}} original source of Titan's atmospheric N2 (dinitrogen), may constitute as much as 8% of the NH3·H2O mass. Titan is most likely differentiated into layers, where the liquid water layer beneath ice Ih may be rich in NH3.|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} a [...] "chemical substance" [...] became firmly {{established}} {{in the late eighteenth}} century after work by the chemist Joseph Proust on the composition of some pure chemical compounds such as basic copper carbonate.

[...] This is now known as the law of constant composition. Later with the advancement of methods for chemical synthesis particularly in the realm of organic chemistry; the discovery of many more chemical elements and new techniques in the realm of analytical chemistry used for isolation and purification of <b>elements</b> <b>and</b> <b>compounds</b> from chemicals that led to the establishment of modern chemistry, the concept was defined as is found in most chemistry textbooks.
