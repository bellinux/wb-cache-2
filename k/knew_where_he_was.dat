25|$|It {{was during}} this {{productive}} period of research, {{in the summer of}} 1934, prior to the eventual invention of nylon, that Carothers disappeared. He did not come into work, and no one <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> He was found in a small psychiatric clinic, Pinel Clinic, near the famous Phipps Clinic associated with Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. Apparently, he had become so depressed that he drove to Baltimore to consult a psychiatrist, who put him in the clinic.|$|E
25|$|When Toole {{was unable}} to resume his {{position}} at Dominican in January, the school had to hire another professor. This greatly upset his mother and on January 19, 1969 they had a horrible final argument. He stopped by the house {{the next day to}} pick up some things and spoke only to his father, as Thelma was out at the grocery store. He left home for the final time and withdrew $1500 from his saving account. After a week she called the police, but without any evidence to his whereabouts, they took a report and waited for him to surface. Thelma became convinced that Toole's friends the Rickels <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> and called them repeatedly, even though they denied knowing where he had gone.|$|E
500|$|After his training, Matthews {{was first}} {{stationed}} in Fort Huachuca in Arizona. At the time, {{the army was}} still using Native Americans as guides in the western United States. During his tenure in the state, he was regarded as an excellent marksman. Next, he joined General John J. Pershing's campaign into Mexico in 1916 to hunt for Pancho Villa. Although Matthews admitted to never having met Villa, he would claim that [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> at." [...] During World War I, the battlefields of Europe were not conducive to cavalry; the 10th Regiment performed duty {{on the border with}} Mexico, including skirmishes with Mexicans and their German military advisors in the vicinity of Nogales, Arizona.|$|E

500|$|He learned {{baseball}} at {{an early}} age, his biggest rival being Juan González, whom he often played against in his youth. As a Little League player and just 8 years old, he moved from pitcher and third baseman(his favorite position) to catcher because his father, who was also his coach, thought he was throwing too hard and scaring opposing players with his pitches. Rodríguez attended Lino Padron Rivera High School, where he was discovered by scout Luis Rosa. Rosa reported that [...] "He showed leadership at 16 that I'd seen in few kids. He <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going." [...] Rodríguez {{signed a contract with}} the Texas Rangers in July 1988, at the age of 16, and began his professional baseball career.|$|E
2500|$|The Red Brigades {{proposed}} to exchange Moro's {{life for the}} freedom of several prisoners. There has been speculation that during his detention many <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> (in an apartment in Rome). When Moro was abducted, the government immediately took a hard line position: the [...] "State must not bend" [...] on 'terrorist demands'. Some contrasted this with the kidnapping of Ciro Cirillo in 1981, a minor political figure for whom the government negotiated. However, Cirillo was released for a monetary ransom, rather than {{the release of the}} imprisoned extremists.|$|E

But it was Andy Jao who kept saying, [...] "Partner, pwede pa 'yan." [...] (Partner, he still got it). He was such a fan of Bogs. So we gambled on Bogs. We set up a lot of plays for him. He <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> going, he knew where the screen was coming. He was not playing {{one-on-one}} basketball. He was playing set-up basketball. I would say he is one of our all-time greats. And the longevity of his career as a shooter will prove it. The records he gave Philippine basketball as a shooter will be hard to beat." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I {{grew up in}} Urbana three houses {{down from}} the Sanderson family -- Milton and Virginia and their boys Steve and Joe. My close friend was Joe. His bedroom was filled with aquariums, terrariums, snakes, hamsters, spiders, and {{butterfly}} and beetle collections. I envied him like crazy. After college he hit the road. He never made a break from his parents, but they rarely <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was.</b> Sometimes he came home and his mother would have to sew $100 bills into the seams of his blue jeans. He disappeared in Nicaragua. His body was later identified as a dead Sandinista freedom fighter. From a nice little house surrounded by evergreens {{at the other end}} of Washington Street, he left to look for something he needed to find. I believe in Sean Penn's Christopher McCandless. I grew up with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|According {{to several}} accounts, Captain Marr {{challenged}} the riders, asking something like [...] "What cavalry is that?" [...] These {{would have been}} his last words. Scattered shots were fired as the Union cavalry rode through and Captain Marr fell dead. Some other accounts say he was killed while scouting out a better position for his men a little distance away from their line and do not mention {{a challenge to the}} Union horsemen. Whether he had moved up to challenge the Union riders or to scout out a better position for his company as some accounts suggest, Marr was not in the immediate presence or line of sight of any of his men on the very dark night when he fell in the dense field. Soon, no one <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> or what may have happened to him. His body was found in the clover field later in the morning.|$|E
2500|$|Jess Neely, a {{brilliant}} half-back and {{a handsome man}} on the campus, is remembered for his popularity {{among members of the}} opposite sex and for an incident that occurred just prior to a football game with Southern Presbyterian in Clarksville. Miles had done an exceptionally good job in mentally preparing his team for the game. He climaxed the pre-game, locker-room exhortation with a soaring call for courage and deathless allegiance to [...] "dear Ol' Normal." [...] Neely was greatly affected by the words of his coach for he leaped to his feet and, roaring like an angry bull, led the team in a rush to the doorway opening to the field. He misjudged the extremely low entrance, and his head received the full impact of the strip of wall above the doorway. He was revived shortly before the kickoff, but he never quite <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> frequently huddling and aligning himself with the enemy.|$|E

2500|$|October 18: A senior NATO {{official}} tells CNN about {{claims that}} bin Laden {{is alive and}} well, living comfortably {{in a house in}} the north-west of Pakistan and being protected by local people and elements of Pakistani intelligence. Stating that [...] "nobody in al Qaeda is living in a cave", the official stated the bin Laden was likely to have moved around in recent years in areas from the mountainous Chitral region in the far northwest, near the Chinese border, to the Kurram Valley bordering Tora Bora in Afghanistan. The official stated that Ayman al-Zawahiri is believed to be hiding close to bin Laden in houses in northwest Pakistan, but are not together. Another U.S. official stated that bin Laden and Zawahiri are [...] "somewhere in the tribal areas of Pakistan near the Afghanistan border," [...] but that their exact locations are unknown: [...] "If we <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> – in a house, an apartment, a villa or an underground cave or bunker – we would have gotten him; we can't rule out he may be in a cave one day and a house in a city on another." ...|$|E

Oh this here, this is my food that I am going to feed you with." [...] He tells the three men, [...] "I have a house right here, right there in that little bay. You bring your canoe over and come up ashore." [...] He pulled up his pole and had a lot of the moss ready. In the house, he had a big fire ready and a mountain of rock underneath, already hot. He took some sticks and grabbed the hot rocks and put them in a bowl that was filled with water. When the rocks were dropped in, the water began to boil. He took the boiling water and placed the moss inside and then made soup. The tells the men to have a seat on his bench with his big hyu7kem plate. This was the first hyu7kem plate made because he knew these men were coming. It made this plate really fancy, and fed them with three Mountain Goat horn spoons. The three men ate the moss.|$|E
