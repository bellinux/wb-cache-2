40|$|The {{operational}} safety and maintenance cost of railway transportare largely {{influenced by the}} geometric characteristics of thetrack. One of the major geometric parameters essential for safeand high performance of railway track is the gauge. Thephenomenon of gauge widening is the gradual increase of thegauge size {{and it is one}} of the major track failure modes that couldcause derailments if it is not effectively restored in due time. Excessive gauge widening is as a result of inadequate lateral trackresistance and lateral rail strength capacity as influenced bysleeper, fastener ballast or subgrade conditions. This paperpresents an exploratory analysis of gauge measurement data tosummarize the main characteristics and explain the progression ofgauge widening in different curve types. The measurement datawere collected from 2007 to 2013 in curves with different layoutsand structures. The growth of gauge over time is analysed andalso the variation in the gauge dimension with the layout of thetrack is presented for engineering considerations. Apparently,gauges of all the curves studied are above the nominal dimensionof 1435 mm but below the <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>limit.</b> The resultshows that curve radius has significant effect on the rate of gaugewidening as it has been shown that tight curves A and B have highrates of deterioration while curves D and E with large radius haverelatively low rates of deterioration. A practical application of thisstudy is the use of the presented quality assessment procedure andthe estimated gauge widening rate for condition evaluation andmaintenance planning.

40|$|The study {{seeks to}} present Radon {{exposure}} levels in some rooms within {{halls of residence}} at the New Site of the University of Cape Coast, Ghana determined using LR- 115 TypeII Solid State Nuclear Track Detector (SSNTD) and E-PERM detecting systems. Pieces of the plastic LR- 115 detectors were covered with aluminium foil and fixed in plastic holder such that the active part (coated part) of the detector was exposed (bare), facing downwards and together with the E-PERM were placed at a location {{in each of the}} selected rooms in the halls of residence for 30 days. The voltages of the E-PERMs were taken using the SPER- 1 Reader whilst the LR- 115 was chemically etched to reveal the alpha tracks. The mean radon exposure level for LR- 115 was 6. 8 mSv (range: 3. 1 - 9. 1 mSv) whiles the mean exposure for the E-PERM was 3. 6 mSv (range: 1. 7 - 5. 3 mSv). The results obtained also indicated that the exposure levels measured by both the E-PERM and the LR- 115 detectors were generally below the Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) guideline limit of 8 mSv. However, some rooms had their exposure levels (measured with the LR- 115 detector) above the remedial guideline limit of 8 mSv, but far below the <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> <b>limit</b> of 20 mSv. Most of a student time is spent indoors. There is therefore the need to have a fair idea the radon concentration and exposure levels in rooms since radon has been identified as a carcinogenic gas...|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} industry {{is linked to}} some of the largest causes of biodiversity loss, including (1) pollution of soil, air, fresh water and oceans, (2) global climate change (3) urbanization and changing consumption patterns, (4) technological development, construction and mining, and (5) resource-intensive agricultural practices. Over the next 25 years, as global chemical production doubles, the extent of externalized damage generated by the industry and incurred by society and ecosystems will broaden and deepen. Current U. S. chemical regulations, notably the Toxics Substances Control Act, are grossly outdated and have failed to provide sufficient environmental protections or motivate meaningful investment in cleaner chemical technologies and safer alternatives, known collectively as green chemistry. Given the scale of the chemical enterprise—and increasing evidence of its impact on ecosystems—a multi-pronged approach to chemicals policy is needed that enables: (1) <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> to <b>limit</b> use and exposure to known hazardous substances, (2) further investigation of priority substances suspected of having ecotoxic effects, and (3) a precautionary approach that facilitates action to reduce potential risk, even where definitiv...|$|R
40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) associated oropharyngeal {{cancer has}} witnessed an increased incidence in the United States (U. S.) {{in the recent}} years. More than 2370 new cases of HPV related oropharyngeal cancer in women and 9356 cases in men are diagnosed {{each year in the}} U. S. Young, Non-Hispanic, white men are at the greatest risk of contracting oral HPV cancer. The alarming increase in the disease distribution of oral HPV cancer is a cause for concern, demanding <b>immediate</b> <b>action.</b> <b>Limited</b> evidence based information is available regarding the screening and prevention of oral HPV infection as compared to HPV related to cervical and anal cancers. Oral health care providers can play a pivotal role in the prevention, screening, timely diagnosis and effective treatment of oral HPV infection as well as in patient education about the same. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess the role that dentists assume in basic risk assessment and education about the association between HPV and oral cancer. It assessed their comfort and confidence in discussing oral HPV with their patients and also assessed how important they consider HPV as an oral health concern. An 8 -item survey was mailed to 500 general practice dentists practicing in the Southeastern Pennsylvania region, who were randomly selected for the purpose of the study. Out of the 149 participants who completed the survey, 112 were males and 116 had a suburban practice. Their mean age was 55 years and their mean years in practice were 28. Sixty-seven dentists counseled their patients about HPV and oral cancer, 52 conducted basic HPV risk assessment in patients, 50 dentists were confident in educating their patients about HPV and oral cancer, 91 considered it an important oral health concern and 32 were comfortable in discussing sensitive topics like sexual history with their patients. 112 dentists had HPV and oral cancer related educational materials for patients in their practice. Dentists ≤ 56 years of age were significantly more likely to see patients with oral HPV infection as compared to dentists ≥ 57 years of age, (c 2 = 6. 344, p =. 012). Dentists with ≤ 29 years in practice were significantly more likely to see patients with oral HPV infection as compared to dentists with ≥ 30 years in practice (c 2 = 4. 683, p =. 030). Age, gender, years in practice and practice location of dentists collectively were a significant predictor (p = 0. 000) of how often dentists saw patients with oral HPV infection in their practice. Results from the study suggested that there is a lack of dentist participation in patient oral HPV education, counseling and risk assessment. Strategies need to be adopted and interventions implemented, to enable oral health care providers to assume a greater role in oral HPV risk assessment, screening and education.

40|$|The goal of model-based {{diagnosis}} is to isolate causes of anomalous system behavior and recommend cost-e ective repair actions. In general, precomputing optimal repair policies is intractable. To date, investigators addressing this problem have explored approximations that either impose {{restrictions on the}} system model, such as a single fault assumption, or that compute an <b>immediate</b> best <b>action</b> with <b>limited</b> lookahead. In this paper, we develop a formulation of repair in modelbased diagnosis and a repair algorithm that computes optimal sequences of actions. This optimal approach is costly but {{can be applied to}} precompute an optimal repair strategy for compact systems. We showhowwe can exploit a hierarchical system speci cation to make this approach tractable for larger systems. When introducing hierarchy, we also consider the tradeo between simply replacingacomponent and decomposing it to repair its subcomponents. The hierarchical repair algorithm is suitable for o-line precomputation of an optimal repair strategy. A modication of the algorithm takes advantage of an iterative-deepening scheme to trade o inference time {{and the quality of the}} computed strategy. ...|$|R
40|$|Whereas {{many studies}} focus on climate skeptics {{to explain the}} lack of support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> on climate change, this {{research}} examines the effect of moderate believers in climate science. Using data from a representative survey of 832 Indiana residents, we find that agreement with basic scientific conclusions about climate change is the strongest predictor of support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action,</b> and the strength of that agreement is an important characteristic of this association. Responses indicate widespread acceptance of climate change, moderate levels of risk perception, and <b>limited</b> support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action.</b> Half of the respondents (50 %) preferred “more research” over “immediate action” (38 %) and “no action” (12 %) as a response to climate change. The probability of preferring <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> is close to zero for those who strongly or somewhat disbelieve in climate change, but as belief in climate change grows from moderate to strong, the probability of preferring <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> increases substantially; the strongest believers have a predicted probability of preferring <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> of 71 %. These findings suggest that, instead of simply engaging skeptics, increasing public support for <b>immediate</b> <b>action</b> might entail motivating those with moderate beliefs in climate change to hold their views with greater conviction...|$|R
