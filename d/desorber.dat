50|$|The solids {{processing}} {{capacity of a}} thermal desorption system is inversely proportional to the moisture content of the feed material. The presence of moisture in the excavated soils to be treated in the LTTD unit will determine the residence time required and heating requirements for effective removal of contaminants. In order for desorption of petroleum constituents to occur, most of the soil moisture must be evaporated in the <b>desorber.</b> This process can require significant additional thermal input to the <b>desorber</b> and excessive residence time for the soil in the <b>desorber.</b> Moisture content also influences plasticity which affects handling of the soil. Soils with excessive moisture content (> 20%) must be dewatered. Typical dewatering methods include air drying (if storage space is available to spread the soils), mixing with drier soils, or mechanical dewatering.|$|E
50|$|Thermal {{desorption}} systems {{fall into}} two general classes—stationary facilities and mobile units.

50|$|LTTD {{has proven}} very {{effective}} in reducing concentrations of petroleum products including gasoline, jet fuels, kerosene, diesel fuel, heating oils, and lubricating oils. LTTD is applicable to constituents that are volatile at temperatures up to 1,200 °F. Most <b>desorbers</b> operate at temperatures between 300 °F to 1,000 °F. <b>Desorbers</b> constructed of special alloys can operate at temperatures up to 1,200 °F. More volatile products (e.g. gasoline) can be desorbed at the lower operating range, while semivolatile products (e.g. kerosene, diesel fuel) generally need temperatures over 700 °F, and relatively nonvolatile products (e.g., heating oil, lubricating oils) need even higher temperatures. Essentially all soil types are amenable for treatment by LTTD systems. However, different soils may require varying degrees and types of pretreatment. For example, coarse-grained soils (e.g. gravel and cobbles) may require crushing; fine-grained soils that are excessively cohesive (e.g. clay) may require shredding.|$|R
50|$|<b>Desorbers</b> using offgas {{destruction}} systems use combustion to thermally {{destroy the}} volatilized organics components forming CO, CO2, NOx, SOx and HCl. The destruction unit {{may be called}} an afterburner, secondary combustion chamber, or thermal oxidizer.

Regardless of the name, the destruction unit is used to thermally destroy the hazardous organic constituents that were removed (volatilized) from the soil or waste.|$|R

High hydrocarbon concentrations in the offgas may exceed the thermal capacity of the afterburner and potentially result in the release of untreated vapors into the atmosphere. Excessive constituent levels in soil could also potentially result in the generation of vapors in the <b>desorber</b> at concentrations exceeding the lower explosive limit (LEL).

50|$|There {{are only}} three basic options for offgas {{treatment}} available. The volatilized contaminants in the offgas can either be discharged to atmosphere, collected or destroyed.

40|$|Nonthermal plasma (NTP) {{technology}} is a promising candidate {{for the treatment of}} air pollutants. An NTP is different from a thermal plasma in that high energy electrons are used to create chemically active species without raising the gas to high temperatures. NTPs have the potential of simultaneous removal of multiple air pollutants with better control over treatment byproducts. A silent discharge plasma (SDP) configuration is one method of easily generating such a nonthermal plasma. Silent electrical discharge plasma (dielectric barrier) reactors can decompose gas-phase pollutants by free-radical attack or electron-induced fragmentation. The radicals or electrons are produced by the large average volume nonthermal plasmas generated in the reactor. In the past decade, the barrier configuration has attracted attention for destroying toxic chemical agents for the military, removing harmful greenhouse gases (oxides of sulfur and nitrogen - SO{sub x} and NO{sub x}), and treating other environmentally-hazardous chemical compounds (hydrocarbons, chlorocarbons, and chlorofluorocarbons). At the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the authors have been studying the silent discharge plasma for processing gaseous-based hazardous chemicals for approximately five years. The key objective is to convert hazardous or toxic chemicals into non-hazardous compounds or into materials which are more easily managed. The main applications have been for treating off-gases from thermal treatment units (e. g., incinerators, high-temperature packed bed reactors, arc melters; low-temperature thermal <b>desorbers),</b> and for abating hazardous air-pollutant emissions (e. g., industrial air emissions, vapors extracted from contaminated soil or groundwater) ...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{small-scale}} {{thermally driven}} heat pumps {{allows for the}} design of innovative and efficient thermal systems. Recent developments have shown the feasibility of the implementation of ammonia-water absorption systems for small capacity applications (3 ̆c 14 kW cooling capacity). The use of low-grade thermal energy in thermally driven systems of that scale has the potential to achieve significant reduction of high grade electrical or mechanical energy consumption. However, further research needs exist for the development of highly compact components that optimize the efficiency of the overall system. Analogous to the mechanical compressor in a vapor compression cycle, the thermal compressor in a vapor absorption cycle where driving energy input to the cycle is supplied. It has been shown that an optimal thermal compressor component configuration exists. The requirement of high refrigerant purity in the ammonia-water system favors the implementation of the diabatic distillation principle. It can significantly reduce exergy destruction in the thermal compressor and provides the opportunity to develop highly compact component designs. In this work, two new design solutions for the desorption stage of the thermal compressor are presented. These designs incorporate the diabatic distillation concept for a direct-gas-coupled as well as a coupling-fluid-driven thermal compressor. The designs operate in a liquid-vapor countercurrent flow configuration and utilize favorable temperature and concentration profiles of specific flow patterns. Therefore, the proposed designs were visually investigated using an air-water mixture to simulate the working fluids. Air-water flow experiments at adiabatic conditions were designed and conducted to simulate component operation. Proper vapor-liquid interaction (termed tray activation) in the purification stages was investigated {{for a wide range of}} flow rates to simulate variation within the component as well as part load operation. Countercurrent flow limitations exist at high flow rates, which can cause component flooding leading to detrimental system performance. These limitations were investigated and flooding curves were established. The effects of minor geometry adjustments on tray activation and flooding were studied. Surface tension effects were investigated by use of an ethanol-water mixture. Â High speed video data were used to obtain quantitative results. The total heat transfer area for single-phase and two-phase flow regions, as well as vapor-liquid interfacial area are quantified based on the flow visualization studies. Both designs were validated as effective solutions for the implementation of the diabatic distillation concept for small-capacity thermal compressors. Tray activation was achieved for part load operation, and resilience to countercurrent flow limitations could be shown. Consequently, these results provide specific and quantitative heat and mass transfer design guidelines for the desorption stage of the thermal compressor. Results from this investigation will guide the development of new prototype <b>desorbers...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} global {{challenges}} {{in the years to}} come is to reduce the CO 2 emissions in view of the apparent contribution to global warming. Carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage (CCS) from fossil fuel fired power plants is drawing increased interest as an intermediate solution towards sustainable energy systems in the long term. However, CCS is still facing some challenges, such as large scale implementation requires high energy demands and leads to high cost. Innovation and optimization of the capture process is needed to reduce the energy requirement and to minimize the investment cost in order to make CCS viable for application in the near future. The CO 2 post-combustion capture based on the absorption/desorption process with monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, is considered as the state-of-art technology. In this thesis, the MEA process has been defined as the reference case for the purposes of comparison and benchmarking. By analysing the MEA reference case, it can be concluded that this is an energy intensive process due to the regeneration energy of the MEA solution (4 GJ/tonne CO 2). For this conventional process, major energy savings can be realized by optimizing the lean solvent loading, the amine solvent concentration, as well as the stripper operating pressure. A minimum thermal energy requirement of 3. 0 GJ/tonne CO 2 can be obtained using a 40 wt. % MEA solution and a stripper operating pressure of 210 kPa. Significant energy and cost savings can be achieved by increasing the MEA concentration in the absorption solution. It is, however, still to be investigated if high MEA concentrations can be used due to possible corrosion and solvent degradation. Increasing the temperature (operating pressure) in the stripper will lead to a higher efficiency of the regeneration and will reduce thermal energy requirement. Moreover, a high operating pressure will reduce the cost and the energy needed for CO 2 compression. The economic baseline for CO 2 post-combustion capture using MEA is defined using 600 MWe coal fired power plant as a reference case and assuming 2005 as the reference year, 8 % discount factor and 25 years as a project life. The process modelling results are used for providing the required input to the economic modelling. The economic evaluation for the MEA conventional process has shown that this process will lead to a cost of ~ 40 /tonne CO 2 avoided. Using the baseline techno-economic evaluation as a starting point, a parameter study for the conventional CO 2 post-combustion capture process is performed. The main operating variables considered in this study were the MEA solvent concentration, the CO 2 removal percentage, the solvent lean loading, and the stripper operating pressure. The economic results show a minimum CO 2 avoided cost of 33 /tonne CO 2 with an optimized process conditions of 0. 3 mol CO 2 /mol MEA lean solvent loading, using a 40 wt. % MEA solution and a stripper operating pressure of 210 kPa. This translates to 53 /MWh cost of electricity, compared to 31 /MWh for the power plant without capture. The difference in costs per tonne CO 2 avoided is small for CO 2 removal in the range between 80 % and 95 %. The CO 2 post-combustion capture process overall performance is evaluated using pilot plant experimental results. Two different modelling approaches (equilibrium-stage and rate-based) are validated and compared using these large-scale pilot plant data. Equilibrium-stage and rate-based models are implemented using the commercial Aspen plus simulation tool. The study indicates that there are no major differences between the two modelling approaches in predicting the overall capture process behaviour for this pilot plant case (e. g. regeneration energy requirement, CO 2 removal % and solvent rich loading). Hence an equilibrium-stage model was preferred as the basis for over-all process modelling and benchmarking different capture solvents in view of its lesser complexity. The rate-based model, however, did yield more accurate predictions of the temperature profiles and mass transfer inside the columns. As a result, for a detailed process design or understanding of the mass and energy profiles in the absorber and stripper columns, the rate-based approach should be applied. The Hypogen concept (electricity generation with co-production of hydrogen) is considered one of the future energy options. This option will facilitate the use of a clean source of energy (hydrogen) for purposes like transportation and heating. This concept is based on the use of syngas for power production with CO 2 post-combustion capture incorporating the possibility of co-production of hydrogen (5 - 10 % of the total syngas). In this concept, hydrogen is produced and purified in two different methods. The first method is based on increasing hydrogen content using the water gas shift reaction, followed by the separation of hydrogen from CO 2 using a high-pressure absorber. This absorber column is integrated with the ambient post-combustion capture process. The second method is based on the separation of hydrogen from syngas using polymeric membranes. In both options, the hydrogen will be further purified using a pressure swing adsorption system. Both options are feasible with an overall CO 2 capture cost comparable to the conventional post-combustion capture process. However, there are some limitations in the hydrogen purity using polymeric membranes. The advantage of the high-pressure absorber is more obvious if an advanced solvent, like the sterically hindered 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol (AMP), is used instead of a conventional solvent like MEA. Increasing the CO 2 content in the flue gas is investigated by recycling the flue gas over the gas turbine. The flue gas recycle is beneficial for the overall capture process behaviour. The total flue gas flow rate is reduced with increasing flue gas recycle ratio. This reduction in the flue gas flow rate results in a smaller absorber column. The capital investment, the cost of electricity and cost of CO 2 avoided are reduced with increasing the flue gas recycle ratio. There is a marginal effect of the flue gas recycle on the solvent regeneration energy using the conventional MEA solvent. This is due to the limitation in MEA solvent capacity. Moreover, the effect of the flue gas recycle on the energy requirement and the overall cost is more significant using a different solvent with higher loading capacity (e. g. AMP). As has been observed out of the MEA conventional process analysis, the desorption energy requirement is a significant burden for large-scale applications. To overcome the high-energy demand and to increase the operational flexibility, a new process concept is investigated. This process concept is based on dividing the CO 2 capture process into a bulk removal step and a deep removal step using two different solvent/systems. This two-step concept is evaluated for two different cases. Both cases are based on the use of MEA in the first step. In the second step, either AMP solution or coal/activated carbon is used for the removal of the remaining CO 2. The results show that the removal of CO 2 using coal or activated carbon is not advantageous due to the large quantity of coal/activated carbon needed. On the hand, the use of the two-chemical solvent has shown potential for possible process improvement. The overall energy requirements for the two-solvent concept can be reduced by 16 % as compared to the MEA reference case. Due to the higher capital costs, the overall cost of carbon dioxide avoided in the 2 -step concept increases by 13 %. Still, increasing the capture process flexibility can be an advantage of the 2 -step concept. This flexibility allows the application of different operating conditions and/or process systems in the different absorption-desorption units. One of the benefits can be the use of waste heat for regeneration, by operating one of the <b>desorbers</b> at lower temperature. From the analysis of the post-combustion capture process that has been done in this thesis, it is evident that to achieve significant reduction of the capture process cost, multiple process parameters need to be improved. For future development of the CO 2 post-combustion capture process, it would be beneficial to direct the solvent development research towards solvents systems, which have lower reaction enthalpy and higher capacity. A significant improvement can be obtained by the development of solvent systems where the solvent is regenerated at higher pressure. In addition, smart process improvement and integration are required to achieve a reasonable cost reduction. Flue gas recycle over the gas turbine can contribute by reducing the overall capital investment. Splitting the capture process and/or combining it with co-production of hydrogen can be an extra economic parameter in the overall process optimization. It can be expected that by improving the process design and the solvent, implementation of post combustion capture on larger scale will be possible in the near future...|$|R

50|$|When a {{collection}} system is used, the offgas must be cooled to condense {{the bulk of}} the volatilized components into a liquid. The offgas will exit most desorbers in the 350-900 °F range. The offgas is then typically cooled to somewhere between 120 and 40 °F to condense {{the bulk of the}} volatilized water and organic contaminants. Even at 40 °F, there may be measurable amounts of non-condensed organics. For this reason, after the condensation step, further treatment of the offgas is usually required. The cooled offgas may be treated by carbon adsorption, or thermal oxidation. Thermal oxidation can be accomplished using a catalytic oxidizer, an afterburner or by routing the offgas to the combustion heat source for the <b>desorber.</b> The volume of gas requiring treatment for indirect fired desorbers is a fraction of that required for a direct fired <b>desorber.</b> This requires smaller air pollution control trains for the gaseous process vent emissions.

The LTTD facility owner/operator is responsible for complying with limits specified by the permits and for other LTTD system operating parameters (e.g. <b>desorber</b> temperature, soil feed rate, afterburner temperature).|$|E

Most thermal screw systems circulate a hot heat-transfer oil through the hollow flights of the auger and return the hot oil through the shaft to the heat transfer fluid heating system. The heated oil is also circulated through the jacketed trough in which each auger rotates. Thermal screws can also be steam-heated. Systems heated with oil can achieve soil temperatures of up to 500 °F, and steam-heated systems can heat soil to approximately 350 °F.|$|E
50|$|Low-temperature thermal {{desorption}} (LTTD), {{also known as}} low-temperature thermal volatilization, thermal stripping, and soil roasting, is an ex-situ remedial technology that uses heat to physically separate petroleum hydrocarbons from excavated soils. Thermal desorbers are designed to heat soils to temperatures sufficient to cause constituents to volatilize and desorb (physically separate) from the soil. Although they are not designed to decompose organic constituents, thermal desorbers can, depending upon the specific organics present and {{the temperature of the}} <b>desorber</b> system, cause some organic constituents to completely or partially decompose. The vaporized hydrocarbons are generally treated in a secondary treatment unit (e.g., an afterburner, catalytic oxidation chamber, condenser, or carbon adsorption unit) prior to discharge to the atmosphere.
