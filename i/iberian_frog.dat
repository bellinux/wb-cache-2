50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>frog</b> is {{threatened}} by habitat loss through agriculture, deforestation, and the planting of non-native woodlands. Tourist development and recreational use of the land may cause disturbances. Introduced fish species {{and the presence of}} the American mink (Neovison vison), escaped from fur farms, may also reduce numbers. Parts of its range include two national parks, Parque Natural del Gorbea and Parque Natural de Izki, and in these it is protected. In other places, especially in the Sistema Central Mountains and Extremadura in Spain, populations are shrinking. The species is classified as being near threatened in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iberian</b> <b>frog</b> is an agile frog, {{jumping into}} the water if {{disturbed}} and swimming away rapidly. It is active both by day and night, and feeds on beetles, flies, caddisflies, stoneflies, spiders, and harvestmen. In Galicia and lowland Portugal, breeding takes place from November to March, but in upland areas, it occurs from March to May. Amplexus, with the male clinging {{to the back of}} the female, takes place in the water. Small clumps of eggs with a gelatinous coat are laid and are stuck to water weeds or placed beneath underwater stones. When the tadpoles hatch, they feed on vegetable matter and take about three months before they undergo metamorphosis into juvenile frogs. These are about 1.3 cm long. Males become mature when they are about 3 cm in length and females when they are rather larger.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Many antipredator adaptations are {{induced by}} the prey’s ability to {{recognize}} chemical cues from predators. However, predator recognition often requires learning by prey individuals. <b>Iberian</b> green <b>frog</b> tadpoles (Pelophylax perezi) {{have the ability to}} learn new potential predators. Here, we tested the memory capabilities of <b>Iberian</b> green <b>frog</b> tadpoles. We conditioned tadpoles with chemicals cues from a non-predatory fish in conjunction with conspecific alarm cues, and examined whether tad-poles retained their conditioned response (reduction of activity level). We found that conditioned tadpoles reduced their activity levels in subsequent exposures to the non-predatory fish cues alone. Tadpoles were able to remember this association and reduced movement rate at least for 9 days after. The ability to learn and memorize potential predators may be especially important for the survivorship of prey species that are likely to find a high variety of predators. However, after those 9 days, {{there was a lack of}} response to the non-predatory fish cues alone in the absence of reinforcement. This could be explained if tad-poles behave according to the threat-sensitive predator avoidance hypothesis, and the perceived risk to the learning cue diminished over time, or it could be due to an apparent forgetting process to avoid non-adaptative responses to chemical cues of non-dangerous species that were ran-domly paired with alarm cues. Thus, this study demon-strates that green frog tadpoles in the absence of reinforcement remember the chemical cues of a learned predator only for a limited time that may be adaptative in a threat-sensitive context...|$|R
50|$|The {{distribution}} {{ranges from}} Spain {{up to the}} North of France, including France, Spain, Portugal and {{a small part of}} Northwestern Italy (Piemont and Liguria). In altitude, these frogs reach from sea level to middle mountainous regions.

In the South of the Iberian peninsula, the <b>Iberian</b> parsley <b>frog</b> (P. ibericus Sánchez-Herraíz, Barbadillo-Escrivá, Machordom & Sanchíz, 2000) has come to be regarded as a separate species in recent years. The third Pelodytes species, the Caucasian parsley frog (P. caucasicus Boulenger, 1896), is spatially set apart with its distribution in the Caucasus and Turkey. This may be an example of allopatric speciation in ice age refugia.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Experiments {{reported}} here {{were carried out}} to investigate the use of acoustic cues by palmate newts (Lissotriton helveticus) for orientation and to study whether this behavior is learned, or whether two populations of palmate newts that cohabit with different <b>frog</b> species (<b>Iberian</b> green <b>frog,</b> Rana perezi, and European common brown frog, Rana temporaria) show different phonotactic preferences. The orientation tests consisted of presenting a control stimulus (white noise), a sympatric acoustic stimulus (calls of R. perezi or R. temporaria, depending {{on the origin of}} newts), or an allopatric stimulus (calls of natterjack toads, Bufo calamita, or R. perezi).

40|$|Invasive species cause deep {{impacts on}} {{ecosystems}} worldwide, {{contributing to the}} decline and extinction of indigenous species. Effective defences against native biological threats in indigenous species, whether structural or inducible, often seem inoperative against invasive species. Here, we show that tadpoles of the <b>Iberian</b> green <b>frog</b> detect chemical cues from indigenous predators (dragonfly nymphs) and respond by reducing their activity and developing an efficient defensive morphology against them (increased tail depth and pigmentation). Those defensive responses, however, were not activated against a highly dama- ging invasive predator (red swamp crayfish). Induced defences increased tadpole survival when faced against either indigenous dragonflies or invasive crayfish, so its inactivation {{in the presence of}} the invasive predator seems to be due to failure in cue recognition. Furthermore, we tested for local adaptation to the invasive predator by comparing individuals from ponds either exposed to or free from crayfish. In both cases, tadpoles failed to express inducible defences against crayfish, indicating that ca 30 years of contact with the invasive species (roughly 10 – 15 frog generations) have been insufficient for the evolution of recognition of invasive predator cues.

40|$|We {{conducted}} static {{experiments to}} assess the effects of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on embryos and larvae of six European amphibians: sharp-ribbed salamander (Pleurodeles waltl), <b>Iberian</b> painted <b>frog</b> (Discoglossus galganoi), western spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes), common toad (Bufo bufo), natterjack toad (Bufo calamita), and common tree frog (Hyla arborea). Embryos were exposed to different and environmentally relevant concentrations of ammonium nitrate (0 to 200 mg NO 3 –/L) for 15 days. Hatching {{took place during the}} experiments. H. arborea was extremely sensitive and had high mortality after 8 days of exposure even at the lower fertilizer levels. D. galganoi and B. bufo were also very sensitive and had significant mortality after 15 days of exposure. The rest of the species did not suffer lethal effects but suffered abnormalities or decreased growth at the highest fertilizer concentrations. Chemical fertilizers or manure could have contributed to the observed decrease of B. bufo and D. galganoi in agricultural areas of the Iberian Peninsula during recent years. H. arborea was the most sensitive species studied. The results of our study showed that environmentally relevant levels of ammonium nitrate can induce mortality and might affect population dynamics of this species in agricultural environments.

40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of 1518 otter spraints we determined the importance of amphibians and reptiles in otter diet and the seasonal patterns of consumption of the different species in a heterogeneous coastal environment in southern Spain. Otters fed {{on a minimum of}} six amphibian and three reptile species. Amphibians were present in 13. 2 % and reptiles in 3. 9 % of the spraints analysed. Remains of amphibians and reptiles were significantly associated in otter spraints, but negatively associated with crayfish occurrences. Maximum reptile consumption occurred during the summer. Though terrapins have been rarely cited as otter prey, they were consumed more than twice as frequently as water snakes in the study area. The highest frequency of amphibians in the otter diet was recorded in late winter-spring surveys, coinciding with the spawning periods of most species. However, the frequency of amphibians remained high during summer months due to predation on the <b>Iberian</b> green <b>frog</b> (Rana perezi), a very aquatic frog that was almost the only amphibian species consumed in this season.

40|$|Abstract Spadefoot toads (Pelobates) and Parsley frogs (Pelodytes) are {{an enigmatic}} group of Western Palaearctic anurans. In the genus Pelobates, a fossorial {{lifestyle}} has enforced a conserved bauplan that masks their intraspecific evolutionary history. We used partial sequences of the mitochondrial 16 S and 12 S rRNA genes to infer a paleobiogeographic scenario of speciation events {{in these two}} anuran genera. Based on two alternative, mutually exclusive calibrations of the Iberian-African split within Pelobates (Pb. cultripes and Pb. varaldii), the disjunction of the Betic Cordillera ca. 14 - 16 million years ago (mya), {{and the end of}} the Messinian Salinity crisis 5. 33 mya, we inferred alternative scenarios for species evolution within both genera applying regression-based dating and Bayesian molecular dating. Pelobates and Pelodytes are both monophyletic genera. Interspecific relationships among spadefoot toads are poorly resolved, and only an Iberian-African Pb. cultripes/Pb. varaldii clade consistently emerges from our analyses. An evolutionary scenario based on the Messinian divergence of African and Iberian Pelobates lineages becomes plausible in the light of geological and paleontological data. Consequently, Pelobates species are likely to have originated from the Miocene. Speciation around the Oligocene/Miocene boundary is inferred for the Iberian-Caucasian Pelodytes, and a Messinian divergence has to be invoked to explain intraspecific diversification of <b>Iberian</b> parsley <b>frogs.</b> There is indication that the different Pb. syriacus lineages may not form a monophylum...|$|R
40|$|The recent genetic {{screening}} of water frogs (genus Pelophylax) in Belgium {{has shown that}} the invasion of two water frog species from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region, P. ridibundus and P. cf. bedriagae is widespread. Possibly other exotic water frogs are invading and establishing themselves through commercial trade. We used a genetic identification approach to rapidly detect and identify morphologically cryptic exotic water frog species in a large number of populations throughout the northern part of Belgium. Among a total of 944 individuals, we found 506 non-indigenous specimens, seven of which belonged to species not recorded before with certainty in Belgium or neighbouring regions in the wild. One of them was identified genetically as the <b>Iberian</b> green <b>frog</b> (P. perezi), but was most likely a P. perezi x P. esculentus hybrid. Six individuals of the Levantine frog (P. bedriagae) were found in a pond in the vicinity of a pet shop where the species is sold. All other exotic frogs belonged to four different haplotypes of P. ridibundus, established in Belgium since c. 1970, and two haplotypes of P. cf. bedriagae, a poorly-known eastern Mediterranean sister species of the latter. Overall, our study underscores the extent of exotic water frog invasions associated with the pet trade. Although two of the exotic species were recorded in small numbers, their early detection is essential with regards to adequate control and eradication of invasive species. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Sublethal {{effects of}} toxicants can upset normal {{behavioural}} responses to predators, leading to increased predation. For example, sensory capabilities can be impaired by toxicants, leading to difﬁculty in detecting predators or other threats. Alteration of locomotor abilities by pollutants can also explain the difﬁculty of tadpoles {{to escape from}} predators. Here we assess {{the effects of a}} nitrogenous fertilizer on the response to predators shown by anuran tadpoles. In a ﬁrst experiment, we chronically exposed <b>Iberian</b> painted <b>frog</b> (Discoglossus galganoi) and spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) tadpoles to environmentally relevant con- centrations of ammonium nitrate. After the exposure, we tested tadpoles’ ability to avoid predation by the red crayﬁsh (Procambarus clarkii). In a second experiment, we analysed the escape behaviour of P. cultripes tadpoles as a function of ammonium nitrate exposure and presence of predatory crayﬁshes. Tadpoles of both species that were exposed to ammonium nitrate were consumed by crayﬁshes faster than con- trols (mean time of predation: Dg controls = 18. 03 h, 90. 3 mg N-NO 3 NH 4 /L = 7. 48 h; Pc controls = 16. 12 h, 90. 3 mg N-NO 3 NH 4 /L = 9. 46 h). Control larval P. cultripes showed speciﬁc anti-predator escape responses, whereas those exposed to the fertilizer did not. We demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time in amphibians, how nitrogenous fertilizers can affect larval defensive behaviours, and thereby increase the risk of predation.

40|$|Many aquatic {{species are}} {{sensitive}} to ambient levels of ultraviolet-B radiation (UVB) and chemical fertilizers. However, recent studies indicate that the interaction among multiple stressors acting simultaneously could be contributing to the population declines of some animal species. Therefore, we tested the potential synergistic effects between ambient levels of UVB and a contaminant, sodium nitrite in the larvae of two amphibian species, the common European toad Bufo bufo and the <b>Iberian</b> green <b>frog</b> Rana perezi. We studied R. perezi from both mountain and coastal populations to examine if populations {{of the same species}} varied in their response to stressors in different habitats. Both species were sensitive to the two stressors acting alone, but the interaction between the two stressors caused a multiplicative impact on tadpole survival. For B. bufo, the combination of UVB and nitrite was up to seven times more lethal than mortality for each stressor alone. In a coastal wetland, the combination of UVB and nitrite was four times more toxic for R. perezi than the sum of the effect on mortality for each stressor alone. One mg/L of nitrite killed half the population of R. perezi at Gredos Mountains at day 10 in the absence of UVB. In the presence of UVB, 50 % of the tadpoles from the same experiment died at day 7. Similar toxic response were found for R. perezi in two highly contrasted environments suggesting this synergistic interaction can be a widespread phenomenon. The interaction of excess chemical fertilizers and manure with ambient UVB radiation could be contributing to the global decline of some amphibian species. We suggest that potential exposure to UVB radiation be accounted for when assessing water quality criteria regarding nitrite pollution. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Latonia nigriventerMediterranean painted frogs (genus Discoglossus Otth, 1837) are {{distributed}} across western Europe, North Africa and some Mediterranean islands. Previous {{studies have focused}} on their phylogenetic relationships, but the taxonomic position of the Iberian taxa (D. galganoi and D. jeanneae) is still under debate. By using microsatellites, patterns and rates of admixture can be quantified. We report the characterisation of eighteen novel polymorphic microsatellite loci in <b>Iberian</b> painted <b>frogs.</b> These loci were also tested in all other species of Discoglossus and in the recently rediscovered and highly endangered relative Latonia nigriventer. Two to eleven loci amplified in these species, and the number of polymorphic loci ranged from zero (in Latonia) to eight (in D. scovazzi). The new markers will be useful in addressing questions related to the evolutionary history, population structure, and conservation of Iberian Discoglossus. They also have potential for use in the North African species D. scovazzi and D. pictus, the latter of which is an invasive species rapidly expanding its range in southeast France and northeast Spain.
