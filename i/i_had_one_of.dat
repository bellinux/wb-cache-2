500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Greg Daniels, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. It was the first full episode of the show that Daniels wrote. The Simpsons writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who were show runners during the previous two seasons, {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. They left the idea with David Mirkin, who took over the job as show runner during this season. Mirkin said he was [...] "very excited and intrigued" [...] with the idea of the episode. Soon thereafter, he assigned Daniels to write the script because he knew that Daniels would [...] "step up" [...] and [...] "throw himself into it". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, Mirkin stated that when he took over the show, he wanted to [...] "bring it back" [...] to character and story, unlike the previous season which got [...] "so fast-moving and so full of cutaway gags". Mirkin added: [...] "I explored the characters a little more, took them a little further. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first episodes where Homer was really tempted by another woman, [...] "The Last Temptation of Homer", and Bart having a girlfriend even nastier than himself, [...] "Bart's Girlfriend", plus more of a focus on side characters. We did the first episode to really feature Apu as a main character. Those were my goals." [...] Kirkland said he was grateful that he got to work with a [...] "wonderful crew" [...] on the episode, including Bob Anderson, who he thought was a [...] "wonderful" [...] director. Kirkland said that Anderson assisted him on the episode and did [...] "fine animation throughout".|$|E

Dungan later recalled: [...] "I was fed up on baseball although <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> my best years in 1905. I {{made up my mind}} I didn't want to follow the game indefinitely, limping {{from one place to another}} as my ability declined. And I had no managerial aspirations. So I just up and quit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Volney Mathison (chiropractor, radio engineer, psychologist, and hypnotist) {{built an}} EDA meter {{based on a}} Wheatstone bridge, a vacuum tube amplifier, and a large moving-coil meter that {{projected}} {{an image of the}} needle on the wall. He patented his device in 1954 as an electropsychometer or E-meter, and it {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Mathison Electropsychometer". In Mathison's words, the E-meter [...] "has a needle that swings back and forth across a scale when a patient holds on to two electrical contacts". Mathison recorded in his book, Electropsychometry, that the idea of the E-meter came to him in 1950 while listening to a lecture by L. Ron Hubbard:p.64In 1950 ... I next attended a series of lectures being given by a very controversial figure, who several times emphasized that perhaps the major problem of psychotherapy was the difficulty of maintaining the communication of accurate or valid data from the patient to the therapist. ... it appeared to me that the psychogalvanometer showed most promise.L. Ron Hubbard told of that encounter in a 1952 recorded lecture:This machine, the electropsychometer, has been acting as a pilot since about the first of January 1952. Very early I wanted a pilot; I had to have some method of metering preclears which was not dependent at all upon opinion or judgment. And I went out and looked at the existing lie detector equipment and I could not find anything which would do a job of work. Now, Volney Mathison out on the Coast heard a talk out there one day, and I mentioned this fact. ... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the fanciest electroencephalographs made and it didn’t do anything very much, police detectors didn’t do anything very much, and Mathison went to work and he floated a current within a current. This machine is relatively simple, but it’s a current floating inside another current [...]. And I am, by the way, very much indebted to Mathison just on this basis of all of a sudden having a pilot.Mathison began working with Hubbard in 1951 and that year filed application for his first E-meter patent, [...] [...] After the partnership broke up in 1954, Mathison continued improving his E-meters with additional patents ( [...] , [...] ), marketing them through his own company and publications, retaining many of the concepts and terms from his time with Hubbard.|$|E
