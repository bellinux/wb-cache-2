40|$|Abstract—A de-interlacing {{algorithm}} using adaptive 4 -field global/local motion compensated {{approach is}} presented. It consists of block-based directional edge interpolation, same-parity 4 -field motion detection, global/local motion estimation and compensation. The edges are sharper when the directional edge interpolation is adopted. The same parity 4 -field motion detection and the 4 -field local motion estimation detect the static areas and fast motion by four reference fields, {{and the global}} motion estimation detects the camera panning and zooming motions. The global and local motion compensation recover the interlaced videos to the progressive ones.

40|$|Competitive diesel pricing {{can yield}} {{tangible}} benefits to truck drivers, fleet operators and farmers. The ability, and willingness, of wholesale distributers to asymmetrically pass {{on changes in}} diesel costs to consumers can adversely distort the market. Existing studies for Australia have focused on petrol (gasoil) prices, while {{there has been no}} testing for asymmetry in diesel prices. We test for rocket and <b>feather</b> <b>effects</b> in Australian wholesale diesel prices at their source. We find that in all seven seaport cities, when the price of oil goes up, diesel prices shoot up like a rocket and when the price of oil decreases, diesel prices fall like a feather. The asymmetric responses are more noticeable when oil prices are rising than falling. Results support the view that suppliers adopt or coordinate almost the same asymmetric pricing behaviour before distributing diesel among retailers...|$|R

50|$|The {{coloring}} {{was achieved}} using {{different types of}} feathers. Black and yellow came from four species of bird called ōōs. All species had become extinct by 1987, with the probable cause being disease. Black feathers were also sourced from the two species of mamo, which are also now both extinct. The distinctive red feathers came from the Iiwi and the Apapane. Both species can still be found in Hawaii, but in much reduced numbers. Although birds were exploited for their <b>feathers,</b> the <b>effect</b> on the population {{is thought to be}} minimal. The birds are said to have not been killed but, rather, caught by specialist bird catchers, a few feathers harvested, and the birds then released.|$|R

5000|$|Air {{and other}} gases are {{generally}} good insulators, {{in the absence}} of convection. Therefore, many insulating materials function simply by having a large number of gas-filled pockets which prevent large-scale convection. Examples of these include expanded and extruded polystyrene (popularly referred to as [...] "styrofoam") and silica aerogel, as well as warm clothes. Natural, biological insulators such as fur and <b>feathers</b> achieve similar <b>effects</b> by dramatically inhibiting convection of air or water near an animal's skin.|$|R

Dietary feather meal additions tended to decrease the final body weight variation of barrows. Barrows fed diets containing 20 percent feather meal from 80 pounds to slaughter had decreased average daily gain, average daily feed intake, digestible lysine intake, energy intake, daily lean gain and backfat depth. Barrows fed diets containing 10 percent feather meal from 190 pounds to slaughter had decreased average daily gain, average daily feed intake, digestible lysine intake, energy intake and backfat depth.

30|$|Strain PF 1 {{exhibits}} potent keratinolytic {{activity and}} can efficiently degrade 10  g/l chicken feathers under submerged cultivation with 81.4  ±  4.40 U/ml keratinase activity. Different concentrations of feathers supported {{the production of}} indole acetic acid by strain PF 1. Strain PF 1 produces maximum indole acetic acid (46.2  ±  0.21  µg/ml) {{in the presence of}} 2.0  % feathers at 120  h of incubation. The indole acetic acid production was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis. However, increased concentration of <b>feathers</b> exhibited negative <b>effect</b> on phosphate solubilization due to increased alkalinity. HCN production also exhibited positive correlation with concentration of feathers. Finally, plant growth of Vigna radiata in the presence of strain PF 1 with chicken feathers in soil was investigated, which showed good plant growth promotion activity. Increased ratio of C/N in soil also supported the plant growth promotion activity of feathers.|$|R
40|$|Light {{interacts with}} an organism's {{integument}} {{on a variety}} of spatial scales. For example in an iridescent bird: nano-scale structures produce color; the milli-scale structure of barbs and barbules largely determines the directional pattern of reflected light; and through the macro-scale spatial structure of overlapping, curved <b>feathers,</b> these directional <b>effects</b> create the visual texture. Milli-scale and macro-scale effects determine where on the organism's body, and from what viewpoints and under what illumination, the iridescent colors are seen. Thus, the highly directional flash of brilliant color from the iridescent throat of a hummingbird is inadequately explained by its nano-scale structure alone and questions remain. From a given observation point, which milli-scale elements of the feather are oriented to reflect strongly? Do some species produce broader "windows " for observation of iridescence than others? These and similar questions may be asked about any organisms that have evolved a particular surface appearance for signaling, camouflage, or other reasons...|$|R
40|$|Tartrazine, {{a yellow}} menace, is widely {{being used in}} cosmetics, foodstuffs, {{medicines}} and textile. It is carcinogenic and also catalyzes allergic problems. In the present work the ability to remove Tartrazine from aqueous solutions has been studied using waste material—hen <b>feathers,</b> as adsorbent. <b>Effects</b> of pH, concentration of the dye, temperature and adsorbent dosage have been studied. Equilibrium isotherms for the adsorption of the dye were measured experimentally. Results were analyzed by the Freundlich and Langmuir equation at different temperatures and determined the characteristic parameters for each adsorption isotherm. The adsorption process has been found endothermic in nature and thermodynamic parameters, Gibb’s free energy (�G ◦), change in enthalpy (�H ◦) and change in entropy (�S ◦) have been calculated. The paper also includes results on the kinetic measurements of adsorption of the dye on hen feathers at different temperatures. By rate expression and treatment of data it has been established that the adsorption of Tartrazine over hen feathers follows a first-order kinetics and a film diffusion mechanism operates at all the temperatures...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHg {{can affect}} {{physiology}} of seabirds and ultimately their demography, {{particularly if they}} are top consumers. In the present study, body feathers of > 200 wandering albatrosses from Possession Island in the Crozet archipelago were used to explore the potential demographic effects of the long-term exposure to Hg on an apex predator. Variations of Hg with sex, age class, foraging habitat (inferred from δ 13 C values), and feeding habits (inferred from δ 15 N values) were examined {{as well as the}} influence of Hg on current breeding output, long-term fecundity and survival. Wandering albatrosses displayed among the highest Hg feather concentrations reported for seabirds, ranging from 5. 9 to 95 µg g- 1, as a consequence of their high trophic position (δ 15 N values). These concentrations fall within the same range of those of other wandering albatross populations from subantarctic sites, suggesting that this species has similar exposure to Hg all around the Southern Ocean. In both immature and adult albatrosses, females had higher Hg concentrations than males (28 vs 20 µg g- 1 dw on average, respectively), probably as a consequence of females foraging at lower latitudes than males (δ 13 C values). Hg concentrations were higher in immature than in adult birds, and they remained fairly constant across a wide range of ages in adults. Such high levels in immature individuals question (i) the frequency of moult in young birds, (ii) the efficiency of Hg detoxification processes in immatures compared to adults, and (iii) importantly the potential detrimental effects of Hg in early life. Despite very high Hg concentrations in their <b>feathers,</b> neither <b>effects</b> on adults’ breeding probability, hatching failure and fledgling failure, nor on adults’ survival rate were detected, suggesting that long-term bioaccumulated Hg was not under a chemical form leading to deleterious effects on reproductive parameters in adult individuals...|$|R
40|$|Enrofloxacin (ENR) and {{ciprofloxacin}} (CIP) are drugs used in poultry feeding. In general, feathers {{that are}} {{incorporated in the}} food chain as a protein source for animal feed, have residues of these drugs. In order to study the pharmacokinetic of ENR/CIP residues in feathers of broiler chickens, to calculate the waiting times for these drugs, before human consumption, we developed the present research. Feathers of broiler chickens were enriched with ENR/CIP. After adding acetone, the mix was agitated and centrifuged and supernatant evaporated under nitrogen. The dry residue was suspended in a tetrahydrofuran solution and the supernatant was injected into the chromatographic system for analysis. Animals showed high levels of ENR/CIP in their feathers after administration of 10 mg/kg enrofloxacin dissolved in drinking water for 5 days. Both compounds were detected in feathers during 9 days. The analytical method developed in this paper to determine ENR and CIP in feathers of broiler chicken showed good linearity, selectivity, accuracy and precision in the analysis conditions. This technique could have important applications in the studies on residues of ENR/CIP in <b>feathers,</b> since the <b>effect</b> of this component in animal diets has not been considered yet...|$|R
40|$|Birds are {{products}} {{of millions of years}} of evolution. Thus, many characteristics of their bodies and wings are designed to make bird flight easier and more effective. One such interesting characteristic of many birds is the presence of a passive appendage on the wing in the form of feathers that pop up during landing or turbulent circumstances. In this paper an attempt is made to describe the behavior of these popped up <b>feathers</b> and its <b>effect</b> on the lift during flow separation with a simple inverted pendulum model (1). This is done by applying the model to a two dimensional airfoil with a wing-flap attached to its upper surface to reproduce the relevant geometry of the bird wing with pop up feathers. Two cases for how the wing-flap is attached to the airfoil are investigated, one where the wing-flap is hinged to the airfoil and one where the wing-flap is attached to the airfoil with a torsion spring. First the theory behind the model is explained followed by an analysis of how this model is applied to the airfoil and wing flap configuration. The optimal wing-flap configurations are then calculated numerically and compared to lift data of the pure airfoil. Since the model is a simplification of the complex interaction between the wing-flap and the fluid flow, the results are expected to be modest. It was found that the optimal wing-flap configurations increased lift with about 4. 4 % and 5 % for the hinge-joint and torsion spring case respectively...|$|R
40|$|Traits that {{influence}} social interactions (signals) are widely {{thought to be}} honest indicators of some underlying quality of their bearer. One hypothesis is that a signal and the bearer's immunocompetence are linked via a condition-dependent pathway. We tested this idea by measuring the effect of specific dietary components {{on the development of}} a melanin-based plumage signal and the production of antibodies in juvenile male house sparrows entering their first moult. We maintained sparrows on one of three artificial diets: high total protein, low total protein, or intermediate protein with the precursors of melanin, phenylalanine and tyrosine (PT), reduced by 50 %. Diet did not affect survival or weight gain. Two aspects of male plumage differed between treatments; the white wing bar was significantly smaller in low-protein males, and the black bib feathers had significantly higher reflectance in PT-reduced males. PT reductions had no effect on bib size. PT-reduced birds also produced more antibodies to diphtheria and tetanus antigens than did other subjects. After repeating the experiment using a better control and a different diet formula to compensate for an energy imbalance resulting from reduced PT levels, PT reduction again produced lighter bib <b>feathers,</b> but the <b>effect</b> of diet on antibody production disappeared. We conclude that the amino acid precursors to melanin affect melanin synthesis if scarce in the diet, but in this case, do not affect size, the most conspicuously variable aspect of the signal. We found no evidence of a condition-dependent link between melanin synthesis and immunocompetence...|$|R
40|$|Mercury (Hg) is a {{bioaccumulative}} {{metal that}} can threaten {{the health of}} wild birds. Feathers are commonly used biomonitoring tools for non-lethally estimating Hg exposure in birds because they contain stable Hg concentrations upon completion of feather growth, when {{blood flow to the}} feather has stopped. Despite the common use of feathers as indicators of avian exposure, little is known about how feather concentrations relate to internal tissue exposures. Songbird feather physiology and how factors such as molt may impact Hg sequestration into songbird feathers are particularly lacking. To understand sequestration of Hg into primary feathers, we examined patterns of Hg concentrations among the 9 primary feathers of individual birds where molt order was known. Hg concentrations in the left primary feathers from 30 salvaged individual specimens from families Turdidae and Passeridae (Catharus ustulatus, Ixoreus naevius, Turdus migratorius, Melospiza melodia, Zonotrichia atricapilla, Passerella iliaca, Pipilo maculatus, Junco hyemalis) were measured. Preliminary results indicated that a conclusive trend in Hg concentration with increasing primary feather number was lacking, with only small variation in Hg concentration among primary <b>feathers.</b> A mixed <b>effects</b> repeated measures test yielded a p value of 0. 2700 with ppm as the fixed effect and bird i. d. as a random effect. Similar studies in seabird primaries have shown strong downward trends in Hg ppm with molt order. The lack of a trend in songbird primaries may be influenced by diet shifts during molt or changes in sequestration to other feather tracts and body tissues. Conclusions on Hg exposure in birds based on feathers must take time and location between feather growth and the feather sampling into consideration...|$|R
