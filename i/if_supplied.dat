25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Commanding Officer of Company F, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from November 28, to December 2, 1950. Assigned to defend a three-mile mountain pass along the division's main supply line and commanding the only route of approach in the march from Yudam-Ni to Hagaru-ri, Captain Barber took position with his battle weary troops and, before nightfall, had dug in and set up a defense along the frozen snow-covered hillside. When a force of estimated regimental strength savagely attacked during the night, inflicting heavy casualties and finally surrounding his position following a bitterly fought seven-hour conflict, Captain Barber, after repulsing the enemy, gave assurance that he could hold <b>if</b> <b>supplied</b> by air drops and requested permission to stand fast when orders were received by radio to fight his way back to a relieving force after two reinforcing units had been driven back under fierce resistance in their attempts to reach the isolated troops. Aware that leaving the position would sever contact with the 8,000 Marines trapped at Yudam-ni and jeopardize their chances of joining the 3,000 more awaiting their arrival in Hagaru-ri for the continued drive to the sea, he chose to risk loss of his command rather than sacrifice more men if the enemy seized control and forced a renewed battle to regain the position, or abandon his many wounded who were unable to walk. Although severely wounded in the leg the early morning of the 29th, Captain Barber continued to maintain personal control, often moving up and down the lines on a stretcher to direct the defense and consistently encouraging and inspiring his men to supreme efforts despite the staggering opposition. Waging desperate battle throughout five days and six nights of repeated onslaughts launched by the fanatical aggressors, he and his heroic command accounted for approximately 1,000 enemy dead in this epic stand in bitter sub-zero weather, and when the company was relieved, only 82 of his original 220 men were able to walk away from the position so valiantly defended against insuperable odds. His profound faith and courage, great personal valor and unwavering fortitude were decisive factors in the successful withdrawal of the division from the deathtrap in the Chosin Reservoir sector and reflect the highest credit upon Captain Barber, his intrepid officers and men and the United States Naval Service.|$|E

500|$|The Naval General Staff {{believed}} that a speed advantage over the [...] German battle fleet would prove very useful in battle, as demonstrated at the Battle of Tsushima, but use of the heavy and bulky Belleville Water-tube boilers, as insisted upon by the Engineering Section of the Naval Technical Committee, would prevent the new design from exceeding 21.25 knots itself. However, after John Brown indicated that the ship's turbines could deliver [...] <b>if</b> <b>supplied</b> with enough steam and that the hull form could reach [...] with 45,000 horsepower, the Naval General Staff {{took the opportunity to}} get the speed it desired by using small-tube boilers. It convened a meeting of the Naval Technical Committee to discuss the issue, but packed it with engineers from the fleet who were in favor of small-tube boilers and the Engineering Section was outvoted. The Yarrow small-tube boiler was significantly smaller and lighter than Belleville large-tube boiler, but required more frequent cleaning and repair and their horsepower dropped off more rapidly with use.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cycle is}} reversible, meaning that <b>if</b> <b>supplied</b> with {{mechanical}} power, it can {{function as a}} heat pump for heating or cooling, and even for cryogenic cooling. [...] The cycle {{is defined as a}} closed regenerative cycle with a gaseous working fluid. [...] "Closed cycle" [...] means the working fluid is permanently contained within the thermodynamic system. This also categorizes the engine device as an external heat engine. [...] "Regenerative" [...] refers to the use of an internal heat exchanger called a regenerator which increases the device's thermal efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|The {{composition}} of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, {{is also an important}} factor regulating animal growth. [...] Ruminants, which may digest cellulose, are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein <b>if</b> <b>supplied</b> in excess. Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also Environmental impact below), several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with formalin to protect amino acids during their passage through the rumen, the recycling of manure by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the partial conversion of petroleum hydrocarbons to protein through microbial action.|$|E
40|$|Price {{controls}} lead to misallocation {{of goods}} and encourage rent-seeking. The misallocation effect alone ensures that a price control always reduces consumer surplus in an otherwise-competitive market with convex demand <b>if</b> <b>supply</b> is more elastic than demand; or with log-convex demand (e. g., constantelasticity) even <b>if</b> <b>supply</b> is inelastic. The same results apply whether rationed goods are allocated by costless lottery, or whether costly rent-seeking and/or partial decontrol mitigates the inefficiency. Our analysis exploits the observation that in any market, consumer surplus equals the area between the demand curve and the industry marginal revenue curve...|$|R
50|$|Classical {{economics}} and neoclassical economics posit that market clearing happens by the price adjusting—upwards <b>if</b> demand exceeds <b>supply</b> and downwards <b>if</b> <b>supply</b> exceeds demand. Therefore, it reaches equilibrium {{at a price}} that both buyers and sellers will accept, and, {{in the absence of}} outside interference (in a free market), this will happen.|$|R
25|$|<b>If</b> <b>supply</b> equals demand, they {{cease to}} act, {{and for this}} very reason {{commodities}} are sold at their market-values.

2500|$|In 1821, {{soon after}} the Danish {{physicist}} and chemist Hans Christian Ørsted discovered the phenomenon of electromagnetism, Davy and British scientist William Hyde Wollaston tried, but failed, to design an electric motor. Faraday, having discussed {{the problem with the}} two men, went on to build two devices to produce what he called [...] "electromagnetic rotation". One of these, now known as the homopolar motor, caused a continuous circular motion that was engendered by the circular magnetic force around a wire that extended into a pool of mercury wherein was placed a magnet; the wire would then rotate around the magnet <b>if</b> <b>supplied</b> with current from a chemical battery. These experiments and inventions formed the foundation of modern electromagnetic technology. In his excitement, Faraday published results without acknowledging his work with either Wollaston or Davy. The resulting controversy within the Royal Society strained his mentor relationship with Davy and may well have contributed to Faraday's assignment to other activities, which consequently prevented his involvement in electromagnetic research for several years.|$|E

The whale-boat, manned by the tabooed crew, pulled towards the head of the inlet, while the ship lay “off and on” awaiting its return.|$|E
