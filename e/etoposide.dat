5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and <b>etoposide</b> are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. In advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, <b>etoposide</b> or vinorelbine.|$|E
5|$|Chemotherapy agents used in {{combination}} {{have been found}} to be effective against neuroblastoma. Agents commonly used in induction and for stem cell transplant conditioning are platinum compounds (cisplatin, carboplatin), alkylating agents (cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, melphalan), topoisomerase II inhibitor (<b>etoposide),</b> anthracycline antibiotics (doxorubicin) and vinca alkaloids (vincristine). Some newer regimens include topoisomerase I inhibitors (topotecan and irinotecan) in induction which {{have been found to}} be effective against recurrent disease.|$|E
25|$|Teniposide and <b>etoposide</b> {{were found}} by Stähelin {{to have a}} new {{mechanism}} of action: they blocked the entry of cells into mitosis (with arrest in late S or G2 phase), in contrast to SP-G and SP-I, which were spindle poisons. His subsequent investigations showed that the early biochemical effect of the two epipodophyllotoxins on proliferating cells in vitro differed from that of the alkylating agents, antimetabolites and Vinca alkaloids. After a landmark clinical comparative analysis by F. Muggia and M. Rozencweig, <b>etoposide</b> and teniposide were licensed to Bristol-Myers in 1978 for further clinical development. A few years later, in November 1983, <b>etoposide</b> was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.|$|E
25|$|An {{alternative}} to BEP chemotherapy, a regimen of 3 cycles of carboplatin and <b>etoposide,</b> is a current topic {{of research for}} germ cell malignancies.|$|E
25|$|<b>Etoposide</b> {{is still}} {{considered}} a potent, well-tolerated combination partner in innumerable hematologic and solid tumor treatment schedules, including those for malignant lymphomas and lung cancer. It is also indispensable in the cure of testicular carcinoma.|$|E
25|$|Standard {{therapy is}} a {{combination}} of limb-salvage orthopedic surgery when possible (or amputation in some cases) and a combination of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, intra-arterial cisplatin, adriamycin, ifosfamide with mesna, BCD (bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, dactinomycin), <b>etoposide,</b> and muramyl tripeptide. Rotationplasty may be used. Ifosfamide can be used as an adjuvant treatment if the necrosis rate is low.|$|E
25|$|Podophyllotoxin is an antineoplastic lignan {{obtained}} {{primarily from}} the American Mayapple (Podophyllum peltatum) and Himalayan Mayapple (Podophyllum hexandrum or Podophyllum emodi). It has anti-microtubule activity, and its mechanism {{is similar to that}} of vinca alkaloids in that they bind to tubulin, inhibiting microtubule formation. Podophyllotoxin is used to produce two other drugs with different mechanisms of action: <b>etoposide</b> and teniposide.|$|E
25|$|T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is {{difficult}} to treat, {{and it does not}} respond to most available chemotherapeutic drugs. Many different treatments have been attempted, with limited success in certain patients: purine analogues (pentostatin, fludarabine, cladribine), chlorambucil, and various forms of combination chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone CHOP, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone , vincristine, doxorubicin, prednisone, <b>etoposide,</b> cyclophosphamide, bleomycin VAPEC-B). Alemtuzumab (Campath), a monoclonal antibody that attacks white blood cells, has been used in treatment with greater success than previous options.|$|E
25|$|Although other {{combinations}} of drugs have occasionally {{been shown to}} be noninferior at various endpoints and in some subgroups of patients, the combination of cisplatin or carboplatin plus <b>etoposide</b> or irinotecan are considered comparable first-line regimens for SCLC. For patients who do not respond to first line therapy, or who relapse after complete remission, topotecan is the only agent which has been definitively shown to offer increased survival over best supportive care (BSC), although in Japan amirubicin is considered effective as salvage therapy.|$|E
25|$|Pre-treatment with {{corticosteroids}} {{has been}} used to decrease hypersensitivity reactions and oedema in response to docetaxel and has shown no effect on the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel. The efficacy of docetaxel was improved by treatment with oral capecitabine, and after more than 27 months follow-up the survival benefit has been confirmed. Doxorubicin was combined with docetaxel in one study of 24 patients and resulted in an increased AUC of docetaxel by 50 to 70%, indicating doxorubicin may affect the disposition of docetaxel. <b>Etoposide</b> has also been shown to decrease docetaxel clearance, though patient numbers for this observation have been low.|$|E
25|$|Two topoisomerase I inhibitors, {{irinotecan}} and topotecan, are semi-synthetically {{derived from}} camptothecin, which is {{obtained from the}} Chinese ornamental tree Camptotheca acuminata. Drugs that target topoisomerase II {{can be divided into}} two groups. The topoisomerase II poisons cause increased levels enzymes bound to DNA. This prevents DNA replication and transcription, causes DNA strand breaks, and leads to programmed cell death (apoptosis). These agents include <b>etoposide,</b> doxorubicin, mitoxantrone and teniposide. The second group, catalytic inhibitors, are drugs that block the activity of topoisomerase II, and therefore prevent DNA synthesis and translation because the DNA cannot unwind properly. This group includes novobiocin, merbarone, and aclarubicin, which also have other significant mechanisms of action.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy {{can cause}} anemia; {{intravenous}} iron {{has been found}} to be more effective than oral iron supplements in reducing the need for blood transfusions. Typical cycles of treatment involve one treatment every 3 weeks, repeated for 6 weeks or more. Fewer than 6 weeks (cycles) of treatment is less effective than 6 weeks or more. Germ-cell malignancies are treated differently than other ovarian cancers— a regimen of bleomycin, <b>etoposide,</b> and cisplatin (BEP) is used with 5 days of chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks for 3 to 4 cycles. Chemotherapy for germ cell tumors has not been shown to cause amenorrhea, infertility, birth defects, or miscarriage. Maintenance chemotherapy has not been shown to be effective.|$|E
25|$|A {{major cause}} of dysgeusia is {{chemotherapy}} for cancer. Chemotherapy often induces damage to the oral cavity, resulting in oral mucositis, oral infection, and salivary gland dysfunction. Oral mucositis consists of inflammation of the mouth, along with sores and ulcers in the tissues. Healthy individuals normally have a diverse range of microbial organisms residing in their oral cavities; however, chemotherapy can permit these typically non-pathogenic agents to cause serious infection, which {{may result in a}} decrease in saliva. In addition, patients who undergo radiation therapy also lose salivary tissues. Saliva is {{an important component of the}} taste mechanism. Saliva both interacts with and protects the taste receptors in the mouth. Saliva mediates sour and sweet tastes through bicarbonate ions and glutamate, respectively. The salt taste is induced when sodium chloride levels surpass the concentration in the saliva. It has been reported that 50% of chemotherapy patients have suffered from either dysgeusia or another form of taste impairment. Examples of chemotherapy treatments that can lead to dysgeusia are cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and <b>etoposide.</b> The exact mechanism of chemotherapy-induced dysgeusia is unknown.|$|E

2500|$|.....there are an {{astonishing}} number of coincidences between <b>etoposide</b> and cyclosporine. The first coincidence was that <b>etoposide</b> and cyclosporine were both found and developed on {{the chemical and}} biological side by the same groups, those of the present authors and their specific biological effects were discovered by one of us; second, both compounds were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration {{on the same day}} in November 1983, although they had been submitted by different companies; furthermore, both drugs act via an effect on an intranuclear isomerase, topoisomerase II, and peptide cis-trans-isomerase, respectively; both compounds are potent immunosuppressants; <b>etoposide</b> as well as cyclosporine are used in the treatment of leukemias or other malignancies; the latter after bone marrow transplantation to prevent graft-versus-host disease, the former also being used in conjunction with bone marrow transplantation; sometimes, the two compounds are used concomitantly, exploiting the capacity of cyclosporine to reduce certain types of multidrug resistance or to modify immunity against tumors cured by etoposide; in the development of both drugs, galenical problems arose, related to poor water solubility and absorption from intestinal tract, and experience gained with <b>etoposide</b> in this area was crucial for overcoming, several years later, difficulties of a similar type with cyclosporine. It is left to the reader to make assumptions about the heuristic aspects of these surprising coincidences..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hartmann F. Stähelin, M.D. (October 20, 1925 – July 5, 2011) was a Swiss {{pharmacologist}} with {{an outstanding}} record in basic and applied cancer and immunology research. [...] He discovered two important drugs: <b>etoposide</b> and ciclosporin.|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{a letter from}} Steven Wolff, an oncologist at Vanderbilt University, Armstrong went to the Indiana University medical center in Indianapolis [...] and decided to receive {{the rest of his}} treatment there. The standard treatment for Armstrong's cancer was a [...] "cocktail" [...] of the drugs bleomycin, <b>etoposide,</b> and cisplatin (or Platinol) (BEP). The first chemotherapy cycle that Armstrong underwent included BEP, but for the three remaining cycles, he was given an alternative, vinblastine <b>etoposide,</b> ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP), to avoid lung toxicity associated with bleomycin. Armstrong credited this with saving his cycling career. At Indiana University, Lawrence Einhorn had pioneered the use of cisplatin to treat testicular cancer. Armstrong's primary oncologist there was Craig Nichols. On October 25, his brain lesions which were found to contain extensive necrosis, were surgically removed by Scott A. Shapiro, a professor of neurosurgery at Indiana University.|$|E
2500|$|Stähelin quickly {{assumed the}} {{leading role in the}} {{discovery}} and development of Podophyllum compounds; four of them, including <b>etoposide</b> (Vepesid), were later marketed. He was able to detect in a partially purified, chemically modified extract of the Podophyllum plant the presence of a then-unknown agent with interesting properties, which had at first been considered by the chemists to be [...] "dirt". The chemists, under the direction of A. von Wartburg, analysed this impurity. Guided by Stähelin's in-vitro and in-vivo assays, they found the active compound responsible for the good antitumor activity of SP-G (Proresid oral) and SP-I (Proresid intravenous; discovered in April 1959, commercialized 1963). Further chemical modifications led to the well-known thenylidene derivative VM-26 (teniposide, Vumon, discovered in October 1965, commercialized by Sandoz in 1976) and to the ethylidene derivative VP-16-213 (<b>etoposide,</b> Vepesid, discovered on October 21, 1966), which remains very clinically successful.|$|E
2500|$|For platinum-resistant tumors, {{there are}} no high-efficacy {{chemotherapy}} options. Single-drug regimens (doxorubicin or topotecan) do not have high response rates, but single-drug regimens of topotecan, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, or gemcitabine are used in some cases. Topotecan cannot be used in people with an intestinal blockage. Paclitaxel used alone is another possible regimen, {{or it may be}} combined with liposomal doxorubicin, gemcitabine, cisplatin, topotecan, <b>etoposide,</b> or cyclophosphamide. ( [...] See also Palliative care below.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Hair loss (Alopecia) can {{be caused}} by {{chemotherapy}} that kills rapidly dividing cells; other medications may cause hair to thin. [...] These are most often temporary effects: hair usually starts to regrow {{a few weeks after the}} last treatment, and can sometimes change colour, texture, thickness and style. Sometimes hair has a tendency to curl after regrowth, resulting in [...] "chemo curls." [...] Severe hair loss occurs most often with drugs such as doxorubicin, daunorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide and <b>etoposide.</b> Permanent thinning or hair loss can result from some standard chemotherapy regimens.|$|E
2500|$|Drug {{interactions}} may be {{the result}} of altered pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics due to one of the drugs involved. [...] Cisplatin, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, <b>etoposide,</b> and vinblastine are all potentially co-administered with docetaxel and did not modify docetaxel plasma binding in phase II studies. Cisplatin is known to have a complex interaction with some CYPs and has in some events been shown to reduce docetaxel clearance by up to 25%. Anticonvulsants induce some metabolic pathways relevant to docetaxel. CYP450 and CYP3A show increased expression in response to the use of anticonvulsants and the metabolism of docetaxel metabolite M4 is processed by these CYPs. A corresponding increase in clearance of M4 by 25% is observed in patients taking phenytoin and phenobarbital, common anticonvulsants.|$|E
