After Chopra decided to perform her own stunts, Akhtar {{revealed}} that he was happy as it gave him the scope to film the fight sequences from different angles. Rampal, {{in the role of}} Jasjit, said that he approached his character in a way similar to how Pran had played it in the original but with an emotional graph. Boman Irani, who plays DCP DeSilva, a role performed by Iftekhar in the original film, revealed that he played the role according to what suited the script, but retained some of the dignity from that film.|$|E
5|$|In February 1943, Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth United States Army {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} Australia. Since Sixth Army would <b>do</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> planning, {{and there was}} as yet little scope for corps-sized operations, Eichelberger found himself with a training role, preparing the 24th Infantry Division, which had arrived from Hawaii, and the 32nd and 41st Infantry Divisions, which had returned from Papua, for future missions. The War Department asked in May 1943 if Eichelberger could be released to command the First United States Army, but MacArthur would not release him. Later, it {{asked if he could}} be released to command the Ninth United States Army, but this was also refused, and this job went to Eichelberger's West Point classmate William H. Simpson. Instead, he was given responsibility for Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to Australia in September 1943. She visited Sydney and Melbourne, and had dinner with the Governor General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, and the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, in Canberra.|$|E

Next, Homer reconciles with his father Grampa, which takes up far more time than he expects and forces him to give up doing {{some of the things}} on his list. After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things, Homer is arrested for speeding. He calls Barney, who is asked to pay $50 to bail him out. After being acquitted, he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe's Tavern with his friends, causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family.

This is unjust {{and should not be}} tolerated. The boss who builds a machine that replaces one hundred workers should continue to pay these workers who now have nothing to do.

As soon as she went back home, she started doing housework. At night, after finishing all her housework, she finally began studying and slept after 12 a.m. every day.

25|$|Because of the {{mistakes}} of its commanders, Kaunitz {{with no more than}} 25,000 Coalition soldiers was able to defeat a 53,000-strong French army.

Without attempting any maneuver, Desjardin and his generals threw their soldiers, with no shoes, wet powder and shabby uniforms into the assault against enemies well-protected by solid fieldworks. The French troops lacked support from heavy cannons and had to contend with the superior Austrian cavalry, so it was not surprising that they were beaten. Around mid-day on 15 May, Kaunitz launched an attack to recapture some positions on the south bank of the Sambre. After three hours of skirmishing and artillery duels, the thwarted Austrian general withdrew his forces.|$|E
