40|$|Abstract. Multi-instance {{learning}} {{attempts to}} learn from a training set consisting of labeled bags each containing many unlabeled instances. Previous studies typically treat the <b>instances</b> <b>in</b> the bags as independently and identically distributed. However, the <b>instances</b> <b>in</b> a bag are rarely independent, and therefore a better performance can be expected if the <b>instances</b> are treated <b>in</b> an non-i. i. d. way that exploits the relations among <b>instances.</b> <b>In</b> this paper, we propose a simple yet effective multiinstance learning method, which regards each bag as a graph and uses a specific kernel to distinguish the graphs by considering {{the features of the}} nodes as well as the features of the edges that convey some relations among instances. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by experiments. ...|$|R
