The newly discovered outer ν and μ rings of Uranus are similar to the outer G and <b>E</b> <b>rings</b> of Saturn. Narrow ringlets existing in the broad Saturnian rings also resemble the narrow rings of Uranus. In addition, dust bands observed between the main rings of Uranus may be similar to the rings of Jupiter.

40|$|Observations {{of thermal}} ions in Saturn's inner {{magnetosphere}} suggest distributed local sources rather than diffusive mass loading {{from a source}} located further out. We suggest that the plasma is produced and maintained mainly by 'self-sputtering' of <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> dust. Sputtered particles are 'picked up' by the planetary magnetospheric field and accelerated to corotation energies (of the order of 8 eV/amu). The sputter yield for oxygen on ice at, for example, 120 eV is about 5, which implies that an avalanche of self-sputtering occurs. The plasma density is built up until it is balanced by local losses, presumably pitch angle scattering into the loss cone and absorption in the planet's ionosphere. The plasma density determines the distribution of dust in the <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> through plasma drag. Thus a feedback mechanism between the plasma and the <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> dust is established.

Fluctuations in the plasma density and/or mean energy, due to magnetospheric and solar wind processes, may induce stochastic charge variations on the dust particles, which in turn lead to an orbit perturbation and spatial diffusion. In addition, Coulomb drag forces may be important, in particular for the <b>E</b> <b>ring.</b> The possibility that electromagnetic effects {{may play a role in}} determining the F ring structure and its possible time variations is critically examined.

40|$|This thesis {{covers the}} {{dynamical}} evolution of {{dust in the}} outer Saturnian magnetosphere, {{the region of the}} large <b>E</b> <b>ring.</b> For the dynamical evolution a model is used, which considers the gravitation of Saturn, including the quadrupolmomentum due to Saturns oblateness, the gravi- tation of Saturns large moons embedded in the <b>E</b> <b>ring,</b> the influence of the surrounding plasma as charging of the grains and sputtering, the Lorenz force due to Saturns rotating magnetic field, and the radiation pressure caused by the sun. In this model, the charge of the grain is characterised by time depended charge currents. The material parameters are derived from the comparison with measurements of the grain potential by the dust analyser onboard the spacecraft Cassini. Further measurements done by various scientific instruments of Cassini discover a geologic active south pole on the icy moon Enceladus. This dust plumes are determined as the main source of fresh <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> particle. Dynamical simulations of dust grains launched at the position of the detected plumes determined the minimal ejection speed of the particles necessary to be- come ring particles. The ejection speed {{is directly related to the}} ring thickness near Enceladus orbit. Long time evolution of dust dynamic showed, that dust particles launched from Enceladus populate the <b>E</b> <b>ring.</b> Thereby the dynamical dynamical evolution is strongly affected by the radial dependence of the potential.

40|$|The general {{topic of}} this {{dissertation}} is {{the analysis of}} impact ionization time-of-flight mass spectra of ice grains in Saturn’s <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> sampled in-situ by the Cosmic Dust Analyzer (CDA) onboard the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft. The source of these <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> ice grains is the subsurface ocean of Saturn’s cryo-volcanically active icy moon Enceladus. The Chemical Analyzer subsystem of CDA generated mass spectra of cations that form when the ice grains impinge onto the instrument’s target plate with high speed. The first aim of this work is a detailed compositional analysis of the organic material in the ice grains ejected from subsurface Enceladus’ into the <b>E</b> <b>ring.</b> Many of these ice grains carry diverse organic material that is characterized in this work. A laser-based analogue laboratory experiment is used to simulate the impact ionization CDA spectra of ice grains enriched in organic material. This experiment allowed to understand the varying cationic fragmentation patterns from organic material in a water ice matrix. Despite the relatively low mass resolution of the CDA, results of the analogue experiment allow to identify characteristic finger prints of certain classes of organic compounds in many CDA mass spectra. Three main categories are classified: (i) Amine-, (ii) Carbonyl-, and (iii) Aromatic-type mass spectra. Furthermore, some aromatic-type CDA spectra show features that correspond to breakup-products of larger complex aromatic species with masses above 200 u. On the whole, the analysis of <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> ice grains in this work gives first insights into the largely varying and complex organic chemistry inside the ocean of Enceladus. The second aim of this thesis is to infer the compositional profile of ice particles in the <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> {{in the vicinity of}} Saturn’s moon Rhea, from a series of spectra recorded on Cassini’s Rhea flyby (R 4) in 2013. No striking change in the frequency of different compositional types is observed along the spacecraft trajectory. However, a varying size distribution of different compositional populations of ice grains is observed and discussed. Sodium salts and organic compounds are more frequent in relatively large ice grains, whereas pure water ice particles become more abundant in smaller <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> grains. A generally higher number density of ice grains is observed in the close vicinity of Rhea, which might indicate either the presence of an ejecta cloud from Rhea’s surface or a general confinement of particles near the equatorial plane of the <b>E</b> <b>ring...</b>|$|R

The phase angle dependence and total brightness are sensitive indicators of the total mass of solid material in the plume. We fit the data {{with a variety of}} particle shapes and size distributions, and find that the median radius of the equivalent-volume sphere is 3. 1 μm, with an uncertainty of ± 0. 5 μm. The total mass of particles in the plume is (1. 45 ± 0. 5) × 10 ^ 5 kg. We have not considered variations with altitude in the particle size and shape distribution, and we leave that for another paper.

The German cosmic dust {{analyser}} (CDA) was developed {{under the leadership}} of the Max Planck Institute for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg under the support of the DLR e. V. This instrument measures the interplanetary, interstellar and planetary dust in our solar system since 1999 and provided unique discoveries. In 1999, CDA detected interstellar dust in the inner solar system followed by the detection of electrical charges of interplanetary dust grains during the cruise phase between Earth and Jupiter. The instrument determined the composition of interplanetary dust and the nanometre-sized dust streams originating from Jupiter?s moon Io. During the approach to Saturn in 2004, similar streams of submicron grains with speeds in the order of 100 km/s were detected from Saturn?s inner and outer ring system and are released to the interplanetary magnetic field. Since 2004 CDA measured more than one million dust impacts characterising the dust environment of Saturn. The instrument is one of the three experiments which discovered the active ice geysers located at the south pole of Saturn?s moon Enceladus in 2005. Later, a detailed compositional analysis of the water ice grains in Saturn?s <b>E</b> <b>ring</b> system led to the discovery of large reservoirs of liquid water (oceans) below the icy crust of Enceladus.
