25|$|He also {{proposed}} {{a theory that}} <b>glomerulonephritis</b> is primarily a tubulointerstitial disease, supported by his earlier findings that most patients with <b>glomerulonephritis</b> excrete large amounts of tubular proteins and tubulospecific enzymes.|$|E
25|$|Without {{treatment}} people typically {{get better}} within three weeks. Complications may include cellulitis or poststreptococcal <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> Rheumatic fever {{does not appear}} to be related.|$|E
25|$|Recently, SDSE {{has been}} linked to post-streptococcal <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and acute rheumatic fever. These {{immunologic}} sequelae have previously only been associated with Streptococcus pyogenes.|$|E
25|$|Treatment {{can include}} {{corticosteroids}} and anti-malarial drugs. Certain types of lupus nephritis such as diffuse proliferative <b>glomerulonephritis</b> require intermittent cytotoxic drugs. These drugs include cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate.|$|E
25|$|ANCAs are {{associated}} with small vessel vasculitides including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Wegener's granulomatosis), microscopic polyangiitis, primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (a type of renal-limited microscopic polyangiitis), {{eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis}} (previously known as Churg-Strauss syndrome) and drug induced vasculitides. PR3 directed c-ANCA is present in 80-90% of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, 20-40% of microscopic polyangiitis, 20-40% of pauci-immune crescentic <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. c-ANCA (atypical) is present in 80% of cystic fibrosis (with BPI as the target antigen) and also in inflammatory bowel disease, primary sclerosing cholangitis and rheumatoid arthritis (with antibodies to multiple antigenic targets). p-ANCA with MPO specificity is found in 50% of microscopic polyangiitis, 50% of primary pauci-immune necrotizing crescentic <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and 35% of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. p-ANCA with specificity to other antigens {{are associated}} with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, drug-induced vasculitis, autoimmune liver disease, drug induced syndromes and parasitic infections. Atypical ANCA is associated with drug-induced systemic vasculitis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
25|$|His major {{research}} interest concerns {{the association between}} hydrocarbon exposure and glomerulonephritis; this interest was sparked by a 1975 paper in The Lancet by Stephen W. Zimmerman, K. Groehler, and G.J. Beirne, who found that {{the large majority of}} their patients with <b>glomerulonephritis</b> on dialysis treatment had prior heavy exposure to industrial solvents. In his subsequent work in this area, {{he was the first to}} demonstrate that a discontinuation of hydrocarbon exposure may improve the course of <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> a finding confirmed by follow-up studies made by British researchers.|$|E
25|$|Single tail vein {{intravenous}} injection of antibody (OX7 mouse monoclonal IgG) against Thy1.1 in rats {{is used as}} a standard animal model to produce experimental mesangioproliferative <b>glomerulonephritis</b> which is popularly known in the field of nephrology as antiThy1 GN.|$|E
25|$|Cyclophosphamide is {{used for}} severe <b>glomerulonephritis</b> or other organ-damaging complications. Mycophenolic acid is also used for {{treatment}} of lupus nephritis, {{but it is not}} FDA-approved for this indication, and FDA is investigating reports that it may be associated with birth defects when used by pregnant women.|$|E
25|$|Celiac {{disease is}} {{associated}} with immune complex <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> Anti-gliadin IgA antibodies are found also more commonly in patients with IgA Nephropathy. The paper finds a link between GSE and IgA Nephropathy, but not between CD and Nephropathy. Calcium oxalate correlates with severity of fat malabsorption in celiac disease.|$|E
25|$|The myriad {{causes of}} {{intrinsic}} AKI require specific therapies. For example, intrinsic AKI due to vasculitis or <b>glomerulonephritis</b> may respond to steroid medication, cyclophosphamide, and (in some cases) plasma exchange. Toxin-induced prerenal AKI often responds to discontinuation of the offending agent, such as ACE inhibitors, ARB antagonists, aminoglycosides, penicillins, NSAIDs, or paracetamol.|$|E
25|$|Membranous <b>glomerulonephritis</b> is {{a serious}} human disease that can be teated with ACTH, which is a known agonist of MC1R. In a rat model of nephritis {{it was found that}} {{treatment}} with a different agonist of MC1R improved aspects of kidney morphology and reduced proteinuria, which may help explain the benefit of ACTH in humans.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{bacterial}} infection of skin lesions, manifesting as impetigo, cellulitis, and erysipelas, {{is the most}} common complication in healthy children. Disseminated primary varicella infection usually seen in the immunocompromised may have high morbidity. Ninety percent of cases of varicella pneumonia occur in the adult population. Rarer complications of disseminated chickenpox include myocarditis, hepatitis, and <b>glomerulonephritis.</b>|$|E
25|$|ANCAs were {{originally}} described in Davies et al. in 1982 in segmental necrotising <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> and by van der Woude et al. in 1985 in Wegener's. The Second International ANCA Workshop, held in The Netherlands in May 1989, fixed the nomenclature on perinuclear vs. cytoplasmic patterns, and the antigens MPO and PR3 {{were discovered in}} 1988 and 1989, respectively. International ANCA Workshops {{have been carried out}} every two years.|$|E
25|$|Histologically, IgA {{nephropathy}} {{may show}} mesangial widening and focal and segmental inflammation. Diffuse mesangial proliferation or crescentic <b>glomerulonephritis</b> {{may also be}} present. Immunoflourescence shows mesangial deposition of IgA often with C3 and properdin and smaller amounts of other immunoglobulins (IgG or IgM). Early components of the classical complement pathway (C1q or C4) are usually not seen. Electron microscopy confirms electron-dense deposits in the mesangium that may extend to the subendothelial area of adjacent capillary walls in a small subset of cases, usually those with focal proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsic AKI {{refers to}} disease {{processes}} which directly damage the kidney itself. Intrinsic AKI can {{be due to}} {{one or more of the}} kidney's structures including the glomeruli, kidney tubules, or the interstitium. Common causes of each are <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> acute tubular necrosis (ATN), and acute interstitial nephritis (AIN), respectively. Other causes of intrinsic AKI are rhabdomyolysis and tumor lysis syndrome. Certain medication classes such as calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus) can also directly damage the tubular cells of the kidney and result in a form of intrinsic AKI.|$|E
25|$|The senior William Heberden first {{described}} {{the disease in}} 1801 in a 5-year-old child with abdominal pain, hematuria, hematochezia, and purpura of the legs. In 1837, Johann Lukas Schönlein described a syndrome of purpura associated with joint pain and urinary precipitates in children. Eduard Heinrich Henoch, a student of Schönlein's, further associated abdominal pain and renal involvement with the syndrome. In 1968, Jean Berger (1930–2011), a pioneering French nephrologist, with co-author, the electron microscopist Nicole Hinglais, {{was the first to}} describe IgA deposition in this form of <b>glomerulonephritis</b> and therefore it is sometimes called Berger’s disease.|$|E
25|$|Renal failure (kidney failure) * {{is common}} in dogs and {{may be found in}} acute or chronic forms. It is defined by a loss of {{function}} of about 75 percent of the filtration system of the kidney and characterized by azotemia and low specific gravity of the urine. Acute renal failure can be caused by loss of blood supply, hypercalcemia, or toxins such as ethylene glycol (antifreeze) or aminoglycoside antibiotics (see: ethylene glycol poisoning). Chronic renal failure can be congenital and/or inherited or caused by cancer, infection, hypertension, <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> amyloidosis, progressive interstitial fibrosis, or any of the causes of acute renal failure.|$|E
25|$|Harlow's {{kidney failure}} {{could not have}} been cured in the 1930s. The death rate from acute kidney failure has {{decreased}} to 25% only after the advent of antibiotics, dialysis, and kidney transplantation. Harlow's grey complexion, recurring illnesses, and severe sunburn were signs of the disease, as her kidneys had been slowly failing and toxins accumulated in her body, exposing her to other illnesses and causing symptoms including swelling, fatigue, and lack of appetite. Toxins also adversely affected her brain and central nervous system. Speculation has suggested that Harlow suffered a poststreptococcal <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> following scarlet fever when she was young, which may have caused high blood pressure and ultimately kidney failure.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{presentation}} (in 40–50% of the cases) is episodic hematuria, {{which usually}} starts {{within a day}} or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection (hence synpharyngitic), as opposed to post-streptococcal <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> which occurs some time (weeks) after initial infection. Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent. All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence IgA antibody production. Groin pain can also occur. The gross hematuria resolves after a few days, though microscopic hematuria may persist. These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides, although it can take many years. Renal function usually remains normal, though rarely, acute kidney failure may occur (see below). This presentation is more common in younger adults.|$|E
25|$|Anti-dsDNA {{antibodies}} {{are highly}} associated with <b>glomerulonephritis</b> in SLE, although some patients with high titers of anti-dsDNA antibodies do not develop renal disease. This {{is most likely}} {{due to the fact}} that anti-dsDNA are a heterogeneous population, some of which have been found not to be pathogenic. Anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in normal individuals, however these antibodies are usually low avidity IgM isotype. In contrast, pathogenic anti-dsDNA antibodies found in SLE are usually of IgG isotype and show high avidity for dsDNA. One possible mechanism for anti-dsDNA and their role in nephritis is the formation of immune complexes that arise by indirect binding to DNA or nucleosomes that are adhered to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). Another mechanism is direct binding of antibodies to GBM antigens such as C1q, nucleosomal proteins, heparin sulphate or laminin, which can initiate an inflammatory response by activating complement. They can also be internalised by certain molecules on the GBM cells and cause inflammatory cascades, proliferation and alteration of cellular functions.|$|E
500|$|Symptoms {{outside of}} the liver are present in 1–10% of HBV-infected people and include serum-sickness–like syndrome, acute necrotizing {{vasculitis}} (polyarteritis nodosa), membranous <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> and papular acrodermatitis of childhood (Gianotti–Crosti syndrome). The serum-sickness–like syndrome occurs {{in the setting of}} acute , often preceding the onset of jaundice. The clinical features are fever, skin rash, and polyarteritis. The symptoms often subside shortly after the onset of jaundice but can persist throughout the duration of acute [...] About 30–50% of people with acute necrotizing vasculitis (polyarteritis nodosa) are HBV carriers. HBV-associated nephropathy has been described in adults but is more common in children. Membranous <b>glomerulonephritis</b> is the most common form. Other immune-mediated hematological disorders, such as essential mixed cryoglobulinemia and aplastic anemia have been described as part of the extrahepatic manifestations of HBV infection, but their association is not as well-defined; therefore, they probably should not be considered etiologically linked to HBV.|$|E
500|$|Chronic {{infection}} with [...] virus either may be asymptomatic {{or may be}} associated with a chronic inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis), leading to cirrhosis {{over a period of several}} years. This type of infection dramatically increases the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; liver cancer). Across Europe, hepatitis B and C cause approximately 50% of hepatocellular carcinomas. Chronic carriers are encouraged to avoid consuming alcohol as it increases their risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer. [...] virus has been linked to the development of membranous <b>glomerulonephritis</b> (MGN).|$|E

2500|$|The {{histological}} {{hallmark of}} SLE is membranous <b>glomerulonephritis</b> with [...] "wire loop" [...] abnormalities. [...] This finding {{is due to}} immune complex deposition along the glomerular basement membrane, leading to a typical granular appearance in immunofluorescence testing.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{recognized}} cause of CKD is diabetes mellitus. High {{blood pressure is}} also a very common cause of chronic kidney disease.

2500|$|It {{is thought}} that the {{complement}} system might {{play a role in}} many diseases with an immune component, such as Barraquer-Simons Syndrome, asthma, lupus erythematosus, <b>glomerulonephritis,</b> [...] various forms of arthritis, autoimmune heart disease, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome and ischemia-reperfusion injuries, and rejection of transplanted organs.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, British, Viennese and Dutch {{researchers}} performed {{epidemiological research}} {{combined with a}} study of other deaths in Vienna {{at the time of}} Mozart's death.

2500|$|Impetigo {{affected}} about 140million people (2% of {{the world}} population) in 2010. It can occur at any age, but is most common in young children. In some places the condition {{is also known as}} [...] "school sores". Without treatment people typically get better within three weeks. Complications may include cellulitis or poststreptococcal <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> The name is from the Latin impetere meaning [...] "attack".|$|E
2500|$|More than 10% {{of people}} had edema, headache, cough, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, muscle pain, or joint pain. [...] Between 1% and 10% {{developed}} cold sores, pain or infection in the lesion, anemia, immune mediated events (like vasculitis, pneumonia, worsening psoriasis, or <b>glomerulonephritis),</b> dehydration, confusion, anxiety, depression, dizziness, insomnia, ear pain, fast heart beating, deep vein thrombosis, high blood pressure, flushing, shortness of breath when exercising, sore throat, symptoms of the common cold, stomach pain, back pain, groin pain, weight loss, or oozing from the injection site.|$|E
2500|$|IgA {{nephropathy}} is {{the most}} common <b>glomerulonephritis</b> worldwide. Primary IgA nephropathy is characterized by deposition of the IgA antibody in the glomerulus. There are other diseases associated with glomerular IgA deposits, the most common being IgA vasculitis (formerly known as Henoch–Schönlein purpura [...] ), which is {{considered by many to be}} a systemic form of IgA nephropathy. IgA vasculitis presents with a characteristic purpuric skin rash, arthritis, and abdominal pain and occurs more commonly in young adults (16–35 years old). HSP is associated with a more benign prognosis than IgA nephropathy. In IgA nephropathy there is a slow progression to chronic kidney failure in 25–30% of cases during a period of 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|Additional {{complications}} may {{be caused}} by GAS, namely acute rheumatic fever and acute <b>glomerulonephritis.</b> Rheumatic fever, a disease that affects the joints, kidneys, and heart valves, is a consequence of untreated strep A infection caused not by the bacterium itself. Rheumatic fever is caused by the antibodies created by the immune system to fight off the infection cross-reacting with other proteins in the body. This [...] "cross-reaction" [...] causes the body to essentially attack itself and leads to the damage above. A similar autoimmune mechanism initiated by Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection is hypothesized to cause pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS), wherein autoimmune antibodies affect the basal ganglia, causing rapid onset of psychiatric, motor, sleep, and other symptoms in pediatric patients.|$|E
