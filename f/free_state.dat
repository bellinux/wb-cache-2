5|$|Institutionally, Reitz {{promoted}} {{the foundation of}} the Letterkundige en Wetenschappelijke Vereeniging (Literary and Scientific Society) of the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State,</b> of which he was chairman for a while, the library at Bloemfontein, and the National Museum of the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} reports into the {{operation}} of the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> were issued starting with the British Consul, Roger Casement's Casement Report and followed by reports commissioned by the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> and Leopold II. These detailed unlawful killings and other abuses made by Abir and Leopold II was embarrassed into instituting reforms. These began with the appointment of American Richard Mohun by Leopold II as director of Abir. However, rubber exports continued to fall and rebellions increased, resulting in the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> assuming control of the concession in 1906. Abir continued to receive a portion of profits from rubber exports and in 1911 was refounded as a rubber plantation harvesting company. The later history of the company is unknown but it was still active in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Following the Irish War of Independence the Irish <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> {{was set up}} as an {{independent}} British Dominion covering most of the island of Ireland. After a brief civil war between the pro-Free State forces {{and members of the}} Irish Republican Army (IRA) who wanted any independent nation to cover the entire island, the status of the Irish <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> was confirmed, and the IRA was forced underground. The IRA had supporters in the United Kingdom, working openly as the Irish Self-Determination League (ISDL), and the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> government shared the names of these supporters with the British authorities, who kept a close eye on them. Between February and March the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> government provided information on individuals that they said were part of widespread plots against the Irish <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> being prepared on British soil. On 11 March 1923 the police in Britain arrested IRA sympathisers living in Britain including Art O'Brien, the head of the ISDL. Sources disagree on numbers, giving either approximately eighty or approximately 100. The arrested men were placed on special trains and sent to Liverpool, where they were transferred to Dublin via a Royal Navy destroyer. It later transpired that not only were many British citizens (Art O'Brien himself had been born in England), at least six had never even been to Ireland before.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of slave and <b>free</b> <b>states</b> after the American Revolution, and far-flung commercial and military activities, new situations arose in which slaves might be taken by masters into <b>free</b> <b>states.</b> Most <b>free</b> <b>states</b> not only prohibited slavery, but ruled that slaves brought and kept there illegally could be freed. Such cases were sometimes known as transit cases.|$|R
25|$|Southern slave holding {{interests}} now {{faced the}} prospects of a Republican President and the entry of new <b>free</b> <b>states</b> that would alter the nation's {{balance of power between}} the sections. To many Southerners, the resounding defeat of the Lecompton Constitution foreshadowed the entry of more <b>free</b> <b>states</b> into the Union. Dating back to the Missouri Compromise, the Southern region desperately sought to maintain an equal balance of slave <b>states</b> and <b>free</b> <b>states</b> so as to be competitive in the Senate. Since the last slave state was admitted in 1845, five more <b>free</b> <b>states</b> had entered. The tradition of maintaining a balance between North and South was abandoned in favor of the addition of more <b>free</b> soil <b>states.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{potential}} for political conflict over slavery at a federal level made politicians {{concerned about the}} balance of power in the United States Senate, where each State was represented by two Senators. With an equal number of slave <b>states</b> and <b>free</b> <b>states,</b> the Senate was equally divided on issues important to the South. As the population of the <b>free</b> <b>states</b> began to outstrip the population of the slave states, leading to control of the House of Representatives by <b>free</b> <b>states,</b> the Senate became the preoccupation of slave-state politicians interested in maintaining a Congressional veto over federal policy in regard to slavery and other issues important to the South. As a result of this preoccupation, slave <b>states</b> and <b>free</b> <b>states</b> were often admitted into the Union in opposite pairs to maintain the existing Senate balance between slave and <b>free</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1870 Spruyt {{returned}} to the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> and to private law practice. He established himself in Ladybrand, a territory conquered by the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> in the last Basotho War of 1867. His insolvency kept following him, however, and as late as 1871 some of his possessions, including a building complex in Rustenburg, were publicly sold for a minute sum of money.|$|E
5|$|Institutionally, Reitz {{did much}} for the {{codification}} and review {{of the laws of}} the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State.</b> With his colleagues C.J. Vels, O.J. Truter, and J.G. Fraser Reitz published the first Ordonnantie boek van den Oranje Vrijstaat (Ordinance Book of the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State)</b> in 1877, making the acts and ordinances of the republic available to the larger public. He also {{played a role in the}} revision of the constitution of the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State,</b> with regard to articles on citizenship and the right to vote, was chairman of the examination committee for aspirant practitioners, and contributed to the improvement of the prison system and the district administration.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that these {{appointments}} were considered possible because the Irish <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> continued to recognise the British monarch as its official head of state. In 1937, however, the Irish <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> adopted a new constitution, rendering the Crown's position in Irish affairs ambiguous. The ambiguity was resolved 12 years later when the Irish <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> formally declared itself a republic and left the British Commonwealth. The basis for such appointments thus ceased and no further ones have been made.|$|E
6000|$|If {{the mothers}} of the <b>free</b> <b>states</b> had all felt as they should, in times past, {{the sons of the}} <b>free</b> <b>states</b> would not have been the holders, and, proverbially, the hardest masters of slaves; the sons of the <b>free</b> <b>states</b> would not have connived at the {{extension}} of slavery, in our national body; the sons of the <b>free</b> <b>states</b> would not, as they do, trade the souls and bodies of men as an equivalent to money, in their mercantile dealings. There are multitudes of slaves temporarily owned, and sold again, by merchants in northern cities; and shall the whole guilt or obloquy of slavery fall only on the South? ...|$|R
50|$|The two <b>free</b> <b>states</b> of Reuss E.L. and Reuss Y.L. merged on 21 December 1918 to {{form the}} Republic of Reuss, the union between Saxe-Gotha and Saxe-Coburg was {{dissolved}} on 12 April 1919 and they formed their own <b>free</b> <b>states.</b>|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the {{promulgation}} of the Constitution, the nation was composed of 19 <b>free</b> <b>states</b> and 3 territories. That same year, two changes were made in the structure, resulting finally in 19 <b>free</b> <b>states,</b> 5 territories and the federal district.|$|R
5|$|John Ronald Reuel Tolkien {{was born}} on 3 January 1892 in Bloemfontein in the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> (now <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> Province in South Africa) to Arthur Reuel Tolkien (1857–1896), an English bank manager, and his wife Mabel, née Suffield (1870–1904). The couple had left England when Arthur was {{promoted}} to head the Bloemfontein office of the British bank for which he worked. Tolkien had one sibling, his younger brother, Hilary Arthur Reuel Tolkien, who {{was born on}} 17 February 1894.|$|E
5|$|On {{the day of}} the abdication, the Oireachtas, the {{parliament}} of the Irish <b>Free</b> <b>State,</b> removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution. The next day, it passed the External Relations Act, which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and {{to be involved in the}} making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|Reitz had an {{extremely}} varied political and judicial career {{that lasted for}} over forty-five years and spanned four separate political entities: the Cape Colony, the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State,</b> the South African Republic, and the Union of South Africa. Trained as a lawyer in Cape Town and London, Reitz started off in law practice and diamond prospecting before being appointed Chief Justice of the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State.</b> In the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> Reitz {{played an important role}} in the modernisation of the legal system and the state's administrative organisation. At the same time he was also prominent in public life, getting involved in the Afrikaner language and culture movement, and cultural life in general.|$|E
50|$|Differences {{of opinion}} and social order between {{northern}} and southern states in early United States society, particularly regarding Black slavery, ultimately led to the American Civil War. Initially, states entering the Union alternated between slave and <b>free</b> <b>states,</b> keeping a sectional balance in the Senate, while <b>free</b> <b>states</b> outstripped slave states in population and in the House of Representatives. But with additional western territory and more free-soil states, tensions between slave and <b>free</b> <b>states</b> mounted with arguments over federalism and disposition of the territories, whether and how to expand or restrict slavery.|$|R
50|$|The Missouri Supreme Court {{routinely}} {{held with}} the laws of neighboring <b>free</b> <b>states,</b> that slaves who had been voluntarily transported by their owners into <b>free</b> <b>states,</b> {{with the intent of}} the masters' residing there permanently or indefinitely, gained their freedom as a result. The Fugitive Slave Law dealt with slaves who escaped to <b>free</b> <b>states</b> without their master's consent. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in Prigg v. Pennsylvania (1842), that states did not have to offer aid in the hunting or recapture of slaves, greatly weakening the law of 1793.|$|R

5|$|The Cape sparrow {{has three}} subspecies. The {{nominate}} subspecies Passer melanurus melanurus {{is found in}} eastern South Africa, east to {{the western part of}} <b>Free</b> <b>State.</b> The subspecies vicinus, which is sometimes included in subspecies melanurus, occurs from <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> east to Eastern Cape and Lesotho. The subspecies damarensis ranges from the extreme southern coastal areas of Angola into Namibia, Botswana and southern Zimbabwe, as well as northern South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> {{was happy}} to take over Abir's {{concession}} as the State had built up sufficient income {{to be able to}} afford to run tax collections by itself. In addition the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> was embarrassed by the continuing allegations of atrocities caused by Abir and it could institute reforms more effectively if it were in control. Leopold authorised the takeover in the hope that the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> would be able to resume rubber collection and exports and on 12 September 1906 an agreement was signed which stated that all profits from the concession would go to the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> in return for payment to Abir of 4.5 fr per kilogram of rubber harvested until 1952. Leopold told Abir's shareholders that he expected exports to return to normal levels within two years. To restore control the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> dispatched a force of 650 men and 12 European officers under the command of Inspector Gerard to the concession. They returned four months later, leaving some areas still rebellious and with news that there were almost no rubber plants left. As a result, the quotas expected per man were cut to just 6kg of rubber per year, with some struggling to find even that much. State income was therefore negligible whilst the costs of controlling the concession continued to increase. Throughout this time Abir was still making a profit by taking its share of the rubber exported for almost no expenditure.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists {{immediately}} {{opened fire}} upon the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> force, {{who remained in}} cover behind a rocky outcropping some ways from the Mahdist line. For half an hour the Mahdists continued to fire at Chaltin's companies to little effect, their shots passing harmlessly above the rocks. Meanwhile, <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> soldiers moved a Krupp gun into position which, under Sergeant Cajot, fired several shells into the Mahdists' ranks.|$|E

5|$|Abir's rubber {{gathering}} practices made it {{the most}} notorious of all the concession companies for human rights abuses in the Congo <b>Free</b> <b>State.</b> Abir was only involved with primary resource gathering and, despite being owned by European industrialists, operated in a style similar to warlords such as Tippu Tip. Abir was supported in its operations by the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> which required the enormous profits generated to strengthen its control over the country during its formative years. The concession companies gave the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> the time and revenue required to secure the Congo and to plan a long-term and more stable program of colonisation. Abir ultimately failed as its harvesting process valued high production over sustainability and it doomed to live out its own boom and bust cycle. Despite this the Abir production model {{was used by the}} French government as the basis for its concession system in the French Congo.|$|E
5|$|Abuses {{of power}} over the villagers by Abir had been {{reported}} by missionaries almost since they began operations in the Congo but the first real public disclosure came in 1901 {{with the publication of}} a report, written by an ex-agent, in several Belgian newspapers. The <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> began an investigation into Abir's abuses during which an inquiry established at Bongandanga heard evidence from missionaries in the concession. As a result, Abir took action against the missionaries, stopping the carriage of their mail on company steamers, stopping the missionaries' boats and confiscating any mail that they carried. Abir also forbid missionaries from buying food from villagers, forcing them to buy from Abir's own stores. In 1904 Roger Casement issued the Casement Report which condemned the Abir system; this resulted in the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> launching another investigation later that year. Although evidence of unlawful killings made by Abir was uncovered the investigation had no powers of arrest and could only submit a report to the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> authorities. This lack of action resulted in deteriorating relations between Abir and the missionaries and there was at least one attempted shooting of a missionary. Evidence for Abir's abuses also came from the governor of the French Congo, to the north-west, who claimed that prior to 1903 30,000 people had been driven from the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> to the French Congo by Abir's actions.|$|E

5|$|After {{his return}} to the Netherlands, H.P.N. Muller settled down in The Hague, where he was {{originally}} only occupied with his consular duties for Liberia, his membership of the Commission for Consular Examinations (since 1890) and his writing. Early in 1896 Muller was appointed as consul for the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> in the provinces of North and South Holland, assisting the consul general H.A.L. Hamelberg. He received the appointment on the strength of his publications about South Africa. After Hamelberg's death later in 1896 Muller succeeded him as consul general. It was an honorary position. In the following years Muller wholeheartedly set out to work for the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> and its interests in Europe. His predecessor Hamelberg had not only been consul general, but had on occasion also acted as special envoy to be able to negotiate treaties and accords with foreign powers. Muller also acted as special envoy and in this capacity inter alia enrolled the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> in the Universal Postal Union, the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, and the Geneva Conventions, and negotiated treaties of friendship and trade with Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. He also strengthened the consular representation of the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> in Europe and inquired into all kinds of practical issues like a cure for rinderpest and improved methods of irrigation.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what he {{regarded as the}} marginalisation of his supporters south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough {{and that they would}} have to make terms.|$|E
5|$|As an {{important}} public figure, Reitz was honoured and remembered in different ways. In 1923 Reitz the University of Stellenbosch bestowed on him an honorary doctorate in law for his public services. Already in 1889, a village {{was named after}} him in the Orange <b>Free</b> <b>State.</b> In 1894 one also named a village after his second wife, Cornelia. A ship named after him, the President Reitz, sank off Port Elizabeth in 1947. The Jubilee Diamond, found in the <b>Free</b> <b>State</b> village of Jagersfontein in 1895 was originally named the Reitz Diamond, but renamed in honour of the sixtieth anniversary of the coronation of Queen Victoria in 1897.|$|E
