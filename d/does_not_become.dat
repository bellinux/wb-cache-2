5|$|In addition, {{like all}} Nepenthes, this plant needs a fairly humid {{environment}} to grow well. Values {{in the region}} of 75% R.H. are generally considered optimal, with increased humidity at night (~90% R.H.). However, N. rajah does tolerate fluctuations in humidity, especially when young, provided that the air <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> too dry (below 50% R.H.). Humidity can be easily controlled using an ultrasonic humidifier in conjunction with a humidistat.|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} the pitch, or field, for {{international}} adult matches is {{in the range of}} 100–110m (110–120yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75m (70–80yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120m (100–130yd) length and 45–90m (50–100yd) in width, provided that the pitch <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105m (344ft) long and 68m (223ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.|$|E

He discreetly asks for her number, and they begin an affair. While Chris is spending time with his wife's family, Nola calls to inform him that she is pregnant. Panicked, Chris asks her to get an abortion, but she refuses, saying {{that she wants to}} raise the child with him. Chris becomes distant from Chloe, who suspects he is having an affair, which he denies. Nola urges Chris to divorce his wife, and he feels trapped and finds himself lying to Chloe as well as to Nola. Nola confronts him on the street outside his office and he just barely escapes public detection.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that Tenar <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> a wizard (like Ged) or a king (like Arren, the primary {{character}} of The Farthest Shore), Cummins argues that her growth is more revolutionary than either of theirs. In contrast to the male bildungsroman in which characters grow into the characteristics society believes they should have, Tenar's coming of age is a female bildungsroman, in which she must struggle against the patriarchal Kargish empire. She learns to value herself for herself and not simply {{for her role as}} a priestess. She is helped through this process by Ged, who sees her as a powerful person, and helps her find choices that she did not see. Over the course of the story she realized that her true power is not her authority as the reincarnated high priestess, but the ability to make the choice to leave the labyrinth and the Tombs. Le Guin suggests that true power is not only about authority and mastery, but trust and collaboration.|$|E
5|$|Babe hires Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) {{to work as}} her kitchen's {{assistant}} after Abi confides in Babe {{about her}} jealousy towards her sister, Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa), which she felt she could relate to. Babe notices Abi's boyfriend, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), flirting with Paul Coker (Jonny Labey), so helps Abi to take revenge. Abi later reveals to a busy pub, including Ben and Paul, that she is pregnant, however it transpires Babe encouraged Abi to fake her pregnancy until she becomes pregnant. However, Ben suspects he has caught an STI from having casual sex, so Babe suggests that Abi has sex with a stranger and she has sex with Babe's relative, Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard), but <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> pregnant. Babe later discovers that Les Coker (Roger Sloman) is a crossdresser. During an argument between Ben and his father, Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden), Babe pushes Abi into Ben and she falls so Babe rushes {{her out of the}} Vic, claiming to be taking her to the hospital. When they return, Abi tells her friends and family that she has miscarried. After Abi and Babe fall out, Babe writes a letter to Ben explaining the truth, and although it is intercepted by Ben's half-sister, Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper), Abi still inadvertently reveals the truth to Ben, ending their relationship.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E

Mrs. Mangel threatens to sue and Des decides to settle out of court, so that Daphne <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> stressed. But when Daphne learns what Des has done, she is angry with him for keeping it from her. During a picnic, Daphne goes into labour and Beverly Marshall (Lisa Armytage) {{delivers}} her son, Jamie. Daphne briefly suffers from postnatal depression following Jamie's birth. During Jamie's christening, Daphne's mother, Tina, turns up. She and Daphne {{sit down and talk}} through their problems and part on speaking terms. Shortly after, Daphne learns that her father is dying. Des persuades her to make things right with Allen. Daphne then decides to nurse her father and she takes Jamie to stay with him. Months later, Gail Robinson (Fiona Corke) offers to drive Daphne and Jamie back to Ramsay Street after Allen's funeral. During the journey, they are involved in a car crash, which leaves Daphne in a coma. Des stays by her side and is holding her hand when she briefly wakes up to tell him that she loves him. Daphne then suffers a cardiac arrest and dies.|$|E
5|$|To {{ensure that}} the audio <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>become</b> repetitive, Crash: Mind over Mutant {{features}} more than 8,500 lines of dialogue. Many of the voice actors from the previous Crash of the Titans reprised their roles, including Jess Harnell as Crash, Greg Eagles as Aku Aku, Lex Lang as Doctor Neo Cortex, Debi Derryberry as Coco, Nolan North as Doctor N. Gin, John DiMaggio as Uka Uka, Chris Williams as Crunch and Amy Gross as Nina Cortex. The role of Doctor Nitrus Brio is played by Maurice LaMarche, a newcomer to the series.
