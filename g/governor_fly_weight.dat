5000|$|<b>Weight</b> - <b>Fly</b> line <b>weight</b> is an {{industry}} standard measure of the actual weight in grains of the first 30 ft or 9.1 meters of fly line. Fly rods are designed to cast fly lines of a specific <b>weight.</b> <b>Fly</b> line <b>weights</b> vary from 1 weight to 15 weight using standards established by the American Fishing Tackle Manufacturers Association. A 5 <b>weight</b> <b>fly</b> line is designed to match up with a 5 <b>weight</b> <b>fly</b> rod. These relationships are not absolute and anglers may prefer to over-line or under-line any given rod depending on their casting style and rod action. Some sinking and sink-tip fly lines do not carry a numbered weight, but instead are identified by the actual weight in grains of the first 30 ft of line, such as a [...] sinking line.|$|R

The experiment objective is to know the effect of zeolite particle size and <b>fly</b> ash-zeolite <b>weight</b> ratio on physical properties such as permeability (K) and dispersion characteristic such as effective dispersion coefficient (De) in the fly ash-zeolite form as backfill material.

40|$|In this study, {{fracture}} toughness of steel fibre-reinforced aluminosilicate geopolymers is investigated experimentally and is modelled by explicit finite element method. Nine geopolymeric pastes with various alkali activators to <b>fly</b> ash <b>weight</b> ratios, sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to sodium silicate weight ratios, NaOH concentrations and curing temperatures were prepared and their {{fracture toughness}} {{was measured by}} pre-notched three point bending specimens. All samples were then reinforced by substituting of 2, 3 and 5 vol. % of geopolymeric pastes by steel fibres with diameter and length of 0. 5 and 30 mm respectively. The effects of four different parameters on experimental and predicted fracture toughness were probed. Results indicated that NaOH to sodium silicate and alkali activator to <b>fly</b> ash <b>weight</b> ratios do not cause any deviation between experimental and predicted results. On the other hand, NaOH concentration and curing temperature were the most significant parameters that caused deviation of predicted results from experimental ones.

40|$|In this study, it {{is going}} to {{investigate}} properties of lightweight geopolymer specimens aerated by aluminium powder. It has been established well that aluminium powder can be appropriately used for foaming of traditional concrete. Reaction between aluminium powder and alkali activator in geopolymers of this study caused high porous structures based on the weight ratios of constituent materials. Different specimens were made by changing sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide, and alkali activator to <b>fly</b> ash <b>weight</b> ratios. <b>Fly</b> ash was substituted by aluminium powder with 1. 5, 3. 0 and 5. 0 wt. % in different mixtures. Results indicated that substituting of 5. 0 wt. % of fly ash by aluminium powder in the specimens with alkali activator to <b>fly</b> ash <b>weight</b> ratio of 0. 35 and sodium silicate to sodium hydroxide weight ratio of 2. 5 causes the best foamed specimen with the lowest density. Compressive strength of all aerated specimens were in the range of 0. 9 - 4. 35 MPa, which is suitable for using as bricks, fire-resistant panels, buried pipeline and so on. Finally, SEM analysis was conducted to evaluate the microstructure of successfully aerated geopolymer. It was seen that in highly aerated specimens, the foaming reaction is too fast that prevents complete alkali activation of geopolymers and many unreacted fly ash particles remains...|$|R

25|$|Fly tying {{material}} {{can be anything}} used to construct a fly on a hook. Traditional materials were threads, yarns, furs, feathers, hair, tinsels, cork, balsa and wire. Today's materials include not only all sorts of natural and dyed furs, hair and feathers, but also {{a wide array of}} synthetic materials. Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer. Whereas lead wire was the traditional method of <b>weighting</b> <b>flies,</b> today's <b>weighting</b> materials include glass, brass and tungsten beads and cones as well as lead. Silicone, epoxy, kevlar thread and other modern materials are regularly incorporated in artificial fly patterns.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the monitoring of corrosion levels in steel reinforcement bars in fly ash concrete by using the electromagnetic method. This method is proposed as a new non-destructive methodology for corrosion level inspection of steel bars immersed in fly ash concrete. An alternating current with a frequency of 100 kHz is applied to generate changing magnetic flux. This method {{is also used to}} generate a magnetic flux in the excitation coil and the root mean square voltage (Erms) depends on the total magnetic reluctance of the sensing coil touching the fly ash concrete. In this research, the first specimen group of fly ash concrete is mixed with various aggregate levels of 0 %, 20 % and 40 % of <b>fly</b> ash <b>weight,</b> respectively without rebar. The second specimen group of fly ash concrete is mixed with various aggregate levels of 0 %, 20 % and 40 % of <b>fly</b> ash <b>weight,</b> respectively, with rebar. Each subgroup is composed of 12 specimens. All specimens are immersed in water for 90 days and then dried for 7 days. In addition, the second specimen subgroup is divided into 4 groups which are normal, low, medium, and high times of corrosion determined by the length of time the specimens are immersed in NaCl 5 % solution with electric current used to accelerate the corrosion level. An electric current density of 400 μA/cm 2 is applied for 0 hours, 48 hours, 96 hours, and 144 hours, respectively. Each group includes three pieces.
