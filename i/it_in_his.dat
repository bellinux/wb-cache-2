Since Perring had already buried the robbers tunnel by that time, K. R. Lepsius did not investigate the pyramid any further.|$|E

5|$|Benicio del Toro had {{significant}} input into {{certain parts of}} the film; for example, he suggested a simpler, more concise way of depicting his character kidnapping Francisco Flores that Soderbergh ended up using. The director cut a scene in which Robert Wakefield smokes crack after finding <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> daughter's bedroom. After rehearsing this scene with the actors, he felt that the character would not do it; after consulting with Gaghan, the screenwriter agreed and the filmmakers cut the scene shortly before it was scheduled to be shot.|$|E

5|$|Enrico Fermi {{and a team}} of {{scientists}} at the University of Rome reported that they had discovered element 94 in 1934. Fermi called the element hesperium and mentioned <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Nobel Lecture in 1938. The sample was actually a mixture of barium, krypton, and other elements, but this was not known at the time. Nuclear fission was discovered in Germany in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann. The mechanism of fission was then theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1990 season, Parcells, {{with whom}} Taylor had become very close, retired, {{and the team}} {{was taken over by}} Ray Handley. 1991 marked a steep decline in Taylor's production.

Taylor {{finished}} with 7 sacks in 14 games and the Giants defense, while still respectable, was no longer one of the top units in the league.|$|E

At the Burns estate, Homer searches for the bill before Burns, who believes Homer is a reporter from Collier's magazine, reveals that he kept <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> wallet. Johnson and Agent Miller burst in and arrest Burns. Burns shouts how the government oppresses the average American. Moved by Burns's speech, Homer knocks out the FBI agents and frees Burns.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 1991, {{the short}} armed {{conflict}} in Slovenia {{came to a}} speedy end, {{partly because of the}} ethnic homogeneity of the population of Slovenia.

Jović published his diary containing the information and repeated <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> testimony at the Milošević trial at the ICTY.|$|E
5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> private correspondence.|$|E

During the inspection, Mark finds numerous code violations, including oily rags placed above a wood-burning fireplace and a long-outdated fire extinguisher. Later, Mark takes a half-day off so that he can help his friend's woodshop meet city code. Ron thanks Mark by building a wooden canoe and leaving <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> office.|$|E
