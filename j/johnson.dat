Although <b>Johnson</b> looked to his business interests, he did not publish works only to enrich himself. Projects that encouraged free discussion appealed to Johnson; for example, he helped Priestley publish the Theological Repository, a financial failure that nevertheless fostered open debate of theological questions. Although the journal lost <b>Johnson</b> money in the 1770s, {{he was willing to}} begin publishing it again in 1785 because he endorsed its values.|$|E

5000|$|From the {{beginning}} there was universal appreciation {{not only of}} the content of the Dictionary but also of <b>Johnsons</b> achievement in single-handedly creating it: [...] "When Boswell came to this part of <b>Johnsons</b> life, more than three decades later, he pronounced that the world contemplated with wonder so stupendous a work achieved by one man, while other countries had thought such undertakings fit only for whole academies." [...] "The Dictionary was considered, from the moment of its inception, to be <b>Johnsons,</b> and from the time of its completion it was <b>Johnsons</b> Dictionary—his book and his property, his monument, his memorial." ...|$|R

5|$|The Life of Samuel <b>Johnson</b> or Life of Samuel <b>Johnson,</b> LL. D. {{was written}} by John Hawkins in 1787. It was the first full {{biography}} of Samuel Johnson—with Thomas Tyers's A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel <b>Johnson</b> being the first short postmortem biography. Hawkins {{was a friend of}} <b>Johnson,</b> but many in Johnson's circle did not like him. After Johnson's death, Hawkins was approached to produce a biography on <b>Johnson</b> and an edition of his works. His biography described Johnson's life, including previously unknown details about his writing career, but it was plagued by digressions into unrelated topics. Hawkins's Life of Samuel <b>Johnson</b> came under swift attack from critics, from friends of <b>Johnson,</b> and from his literary rival, James Boswell immediately after its publication. Many of the critics attacked Hawkins for his lack of strict focus on Johnson's life or for his unfavourable depiction of <b>Johnson</b> in various circumstances.|$|E

Firing, he saw glycol streaming behind it. On 14 July, the Tangmere Wing flew on Circus 48 to St Omer. Losing {{sight of the}} squadron, <b>Johnson</b> and his wingman proceeded inland at 3,000 feet after spotting three aircraft. Turning in behind them, he identified them as Bf 109Fs. <b>Johnson</b> dived so as {{to come up and}} underneath into the enemy's blind spot. Closing to 15 yards, he gave the trailing Bf 109 a two-second burst. The tail was blown off and his windshield was covered in oil from the Messerschmitt. <b>Johnson</b> saw the other Bf 109s spinning down out of control. Having also lost his wingman, <b>Johnson</b> disengaged. Climbing and crossing the coast at Etaples, <b>Johnson</b> bounced a Bf 109E. Giving chase in a dive to 2,000 feet and firing at 150 yards, he observed something flying off the Bf 109's starboard wing. <b>Johnson</b> could not see any more owing to the oil-covered windscreen and did not make a claim. His second victory was probably Unteroffizier (Corporal) R. Klienike, III./Jagdgeschwader 26 (Third Group, Fighter Wing 26) who was posted missing.|$|E
