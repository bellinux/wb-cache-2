25|$|Sleep is {{regulated}} by two parallel mechanisms, homeostatic regulation and circadian regulation, {{controlled by the}} hypothalamus and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), respectively. Although {{the exact nature of}} sleep drive is unknown, homeostatic pressure builds up during wakefulness and this continues until the person <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Adenosine is thought to {{play a critical role in}} this and many people have proposed that the pressure build-up is partially due to adenosine accumulation. However, some researchers have shown that accumulation alone does not explain this phenomenon completely. The circadian rhythm is a 24-hour cycle in the body, which has been shown to continue even in the absence of environmental cues. This is caused by projections from the SCN to the brain stem.|$|E

Early morning on the next day, Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa go to the royal garden of Janaka to get flowers for Viśvāmitra's worship. Sītā arrives in the same garden to worship Pārvatī on the day before her Svayaṃvara. Sītā and Rāma see each other for the first time when they come face-to-face in the garden.

Lakṣmaṇa then bows to Sītā, thinking of her as his mother. Sītā worships Rāma in her mind and then departs for her palace after worshipping Pārvatī. Rāma and Lakṣmaṇa return to Viśvāmitra and worship him with the flowers from Janaka's royal garden. Rāma tells Viśvāmitra everything about the attraction he felt for Sītā. Viśvāmitra blesses Rāma and <b>goes</b> <b>to</b> <b>sleep.</b> Rāma is awake in the night, admiring the beauty of the moon which reminds him of the face of Sītā.|$|E
