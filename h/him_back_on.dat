5|$|Bart wanders onto a U.S. Army {{base and}} manages to hijack a tank. He cuts {{a swath of}} {{destruction}} through the town and eventually stops at the school.

5|$|In the interim, {{between the}} Royal Rumble and WrestleMania, the McMahon-Helmsley Faction {{was brought to}} an {{official}} on-screen conclusion. By the time he returned, Triple H's on-screen marriage to Stephanie McMahon was faltering, so Stephanie faked a pregnancy {{in order to get}} <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> her side. When he learned that it was fake, he dumped her publicly on Raw when they were supposed to renew their wedding vows. Stephanie aligned with Jericho afterward, but she was forced to leave after losing a triple threat match on Raw the night after WrestleMania when she was pinned by Triple H. The divorce, and thus the storyline, was finalized at Vengeance.|$|E

5|$|On August 5, 2007, {{during the}} Firestone Indy 400, Foyt was {{involved}} in a spectacular seven-car crash in which Dario Franchitti's car was sent airborne and then came down on Foyt's car.

Even though Foyt was passed a few laps later by Tony Kanaan and Scott Dixon, he managed to hold {{on the rest of the}} way and drive to a career-best 3rd-place finish, the first Top-5 finish of his career. It was also the best finish in Vision Racing's team history, tying Tomas Scheckter's 3rd-place finish at the Milwaukee Mile in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Su Shi {{and friends}} {{continued}} to write poetry, despite (or perhaps encouraged by) their frequent banishment. Su Shi collected {{some of his}} extent works from friends, having ensured that any offending lines had been removed (Murck, 50). Some of his poetry began {{more and more to}} use such a deep and subtle allusive process that {{it would be difficult for}} those outside his group to grasp the real meaning, let alone put <b>him</b> <b>back</b> <b>on</b> trial. One of these techniques was to use rhymes from other poems; thus, alluding to lines from that poem, and also alluding to other poems which Su Shi and his friends circulated which also matched these rhymes. Subtle complexities of profound political dissent could then be masked under cover of seemingly innocuous lines about nature scenes in the Xiaoxiang region: indeed a set of 8 conventional scenes evolved (Murck, passim). These are known as the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's move to Austin Aztex was {{finalised}} in March {{and completed}} their initial starting side, which included fellow English players Alex Tapp and Gifton Noel-Williams and Welshman Gareth Evans.

[...] Johnson played in the club's first game, which was a 2–0 friendly defeat to Major League Soccer's New England Revolution and scored in another pre-season match. Johnson scored his first goal for Austin on 25 April against fellow expansion side the Cleveland City Stars when he scored in the 13th minute of play. Johnson scored his second goal in the final minute of the match. In the 2009 season, Johnson played 22 league matches, scoring five goals making him the Aztex leading goalscorer, but he was forced to miss part of the season because of work permit problems after he returned to England with Evans. Johnson also played in two of the Aztex's three US Open Cup matches, playing in the first round, scoring the second goal in a 2–0 win over Mississippi Brilla and in Austin's 2–0 defeat to Houston Dynamo in the third round. The Austin Chronicle named Johnson the city's best player. The newspaper's citation said: [...] "he's been out there hustling every game and providing leadership and a steadying influence on and off the field. At 24, with a background that includes Manchester United and English national youth teams, he might not be with us much longer, but it's a treat while it lasts." [...] He went on to win one of the club's player of the season awards.|$|E
