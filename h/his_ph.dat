2500|$|At {{the same}} time that Beckman was {{approached}} about infrared spectrometry, he was contacted by Paul Rosenberg. Rosenberg worked at MIT's Radiation Laboratory. [...] The lab was part of a secret network of research institutions in both the United States and Britain that were working to develop radar, [...] "radio detecting and ranging". [...] The project was interested in Beckman because of the high quality of the tuning knobs or [...] "potentiometers" [...] which were used on <b>his</b> <b>pH</b> meters. [...] Beckman had trademarked the design of the pH meter knobs, under the name [...] "helipot" [...] for [...] "helical potentiometer". [...] Rosenberg had found that the helipot was more precise, by a factor of ten, than other knobs. [...] Nonetheless, for use in continuously moving airplanes, ships, or submarines, which might be under attack, a redesign would be needed to ensure that the knobs could withstand shocks and vibrations.|$|E
