A novel {{rectangular}} vectorization method {{which uses}} for auto-forming board {{based on the}} feature analysis on {{a great many of}} shear wall structural design charts is presented. The constructional design drawing was firstly deconstructed into elementary figure unit which contains lines and rectangular angles. These split functional cell were secondly vectorized by restricting straight line so as to reorder and reclassify these essential structural parts. Finally, the components made for the <b>forming</b> <b>board</b> were obtained from the identified cells combined with the shear well angle’s location. This auto-forming board technology has been applied in cast-in-place concrete practices and the results demonstrate that this method and technology can accurately identify complex constructional drawing constitution of building and raise substantially the efficiency of auto-forming board for building construction. This method also provides the key technique support for smart construction technology...|$|E
40|$|Phased arrays {{have been}} in use since World War II but their {{commercial}} application has been constrained by the bulk and cost of the beam forming system. High resolution side scan sonar systems have many operational parameters that may only be extended {{with the aid of}} phased arrays, the resolution and the imaging rate being the most important. This thesis describes a microprocessor controlled dynamically focused side scan sonar where high resolution and high image acquisition rates are achieved. Dynamic focusing prevents the depth of field limitations of fixed focus arrays by updating the array phases at regular intervals so as to create a focal point which recedes from the array in synchronism with the returning echoes from the transmitted pulse. A high image acquisition rate is achieved through the simultaneous formation of multiple beams. Using a microprocessor as a low-cost controller demands rapidly executable software and a little specialized hardware. Programmable quadrature phase shifters give phase and amplitude control. A beam <b>forming</b> <b>board</b> combines the phase shifted signals into a beam and samples it. A 'time domain multiplexed' transmitter solves the problem of efficient insonification of swaths. The system timing is complex; while image samples are captured data is formatted and presented for recording on a chart recorder. This occurs in real-time, while the focus of each of the multiple beams is changed almost every two meters. Tank tests of the completed system provide confirmation of the resolution predicted with theory and computer simulation. Sea trials confirm that resolution close to that predicted may be obtained under operational circumstances. The results obtained fully justify the assertion that low cost microprocessor controlled dynamically focused multiple beam phased arrays are both an attainable and an attractive solution to the problems faced by the designer of high resolution side scan sonar systems...|$|E

Despite lapse of about a century since the design and development of <b>form</b> <b>boards</b> in the context of testing and training senses in children with intellectual disabilities, the humble device continues to remain one of the most popular, easy-to-use, and simplest tools being used by rehabilitation professionals. The initial <b>form</b> <b>board</b> era of early 19 th century witnessed a spurt of several research studies which has been intermittently tried, retried, tested and retested across ages, nations, cultures and backgrounds. This tribute recommends innovative research even today as the befitting commemoration rather than a requiem for the genius in this apparatus...|$|R
