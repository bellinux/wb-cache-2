5000|$|In this, Hilferding saw an {{opportunity}} for a path to socialism that was distinct from the one foreseen by Marx: [...] "The socializing function of finance capital facilitates enormously the task of overcoming capitalism. Once finance capital has brought the most importance (sic) branches of production under its control, it is enough for society, through its conscious executive organ - the state conquered by the working class - to seize finance capital in order to gain immediate control of these branches of production." [...] This would make it unnecessary to expropriate [...] "peasant farms and small businesses" [...] because they would be indirectly socialized, through the socialization of institutions upon which finance capital had already made them dependent. Thus, because a narrow class dominated the economy, socialist revolution could gain wider support by directly expropriating only from that narrow class. In particular, according to Hilferding, societies that had not reached the level of <b>economic</b> <b>maturity</b> anticipated by Marx as making them [...] "ripe" [...] for socialism could be opened to socialist possibilities.

On an industry level, physical asset obsolescence, industry growth, and industry concentration are the most important factors.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Palm oil {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significant}} agricultural products in the areas of Southeast Asia, South Africa, and South America, which plays a crucial role in <b>economic</b> development. <b>Maturity</b> or ripeness of the palm oil fruits commands the quality, as well as the overall marketing of palm oil produced. The traditional method for the detection of palm oil fruit maturity involves manual detection of maturity fresh palm oil fruits or counting number of fruits loosened in a bunch. Manual counting of fresh palm oil fruits is a labor-intensive process takes a long time, leading to bias and human error, which affects dramatically the profitability of farmers. This study uses a genetic algorithm to develop palm oil ripeness index. Genetic algorithms are adaptive heuristic search algorithm based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics. The results of this study indicated that genetic algorithm is useful for the detection of palm oil maturity. This has been achieved for the overall accuracy of (67. 10 %), while accuracy of (60 %) and (73. 60 %) were achieved for under-ripe and ripe palm oil fruits respectively...|$|R

Despite the benefits achievable in the practice of programme management, the awareness and understanding of its practice in the construction industry remains vague {{as a result of a}} lack of clarity and inconsistencies associated with its definitions. To fully understand the core essence of programme management, it is imperative that its quintessential definition, practice and context are clearly understood and documented. This research is based on a pragmatic synthesis of literature review and industrial questionnaire survey which establishes the relationship, similarities and differences between programme management and project management and subsequently draws comparisons of the practices relevant to programmes between programme and non-programme organisations. The research further highlights the implications of unawareness and lack of understanding that can affect the effective implementation and practice of programme management in the UK construction environment...|$|R

The main explanations: extremely high interest payments (caused by Brazil's weak fiscal stance and quasi-fixed exchange rate regime) and the accumulation of assets (especially obligations of Brazil's states).

The originality of this paper consists in applying the co-integration testing techniques for panel data regarding commerce and the “authentic” savings rate, an indicator of sustainable development, which determines the productive base that will be inherited by future generations. Econometric tests suggest a negative long-run relationship between commerce intensity and sustainable development. This result is in agreement with conclusions of other studies that have documented, in the region, an economic growth fueled by the adoption of unsustainable western consumption ideals, a low public consciousness about ecological values and weak institutions dealing with environmental issues at both government and civil society level.

There was unprecedented territorial expansion and exploration initiated by struggles with non-Chinese peoples, especially the nomadic Xiongnu of the Eurasian Steppe. The Han emperors were initially forced to acknowledge the rival Xiongnu Chanyus as their equals, yet in reality the Han was an inferior partner in a tributary and royal marriage alliance known as heqin. This agreement was broken when Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141-87 BCE) launched a series of military campaigns which eventually caused the fissure of the Xiongnu Federation and redefined the borders of China. The Han realm was expanded into the Hexi Corridor of modern Gansu province, the Tarim Basin of modern Xinjiang, modern Yunnan and Hainan, modern northern Vietnam, modern North Korea, and southern Outer Mongolia. The Han court established trade and tributary relations with rulers as far west as the Arsacids, to whose court at Ctesiphon in Mesopotamia the Han monarchs sent envoys.
