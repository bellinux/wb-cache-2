25|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> {{in the last}} quarter of the twentieth century brought a new era of library operations and services, with the ability to access information resources beyond those available in the physical facility. As early as 1973, the Library began to take advantage of <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> services by acquiring the New York Times Information Bank, the first computerized online information retrieval service. By the 1990s, the library was able to access thousands of U.S. and foreign newspapers and magazines, highly specialized biographic and subject information, and U.S. government and think tank documents through commercial and government databases. The development of the Department's Intranet on the Open Net system has made the resources of the library accessible to Department employees worldwide. The library's electronic catalog, new acquisitions lists, and connection to reference services are available on the Department's I-Net.|$|E

500|$|Beacon Hill Station was {{designed}} by architectural firm Otak and built by {{a joint venture between}} engineering firms Hatch Mott MacDonald and Jacobs Engineering Group. The station building houses entrances to four high-speed elevators that travel [...] to platform level in 20 seconds. Beacon Hill's [...] split island platform is located between the two Beacon Hill Tunnel tubes, with a small cross-tunnel passageway between the two sections of the platform. It serves Central Link's two tracks; the northbound tracks serves trains to University of Washington station, while the southbound tracks serves trains to Angle Lake station. As with all Link stations, <b>electronic</b> <b>information</b> signs above the platform offer real-time information about train arrivals and service alerts, in addition to announcements over an intercom. Beacon Hill's bus stops are located south of the station building on Beacon Avenue, with the northbound stop located adjacent to the station and the southbound stop accessible via a signaled crosswalk. The station does not include public parking, but is within walking distance of several private parking lots that require payment. ORCA card vending machines are located outside the station building, along with bicycle lockers and a bicycle cage with space for 48 bicycles. Emergency staircases and the ventilation shaft are capped by the east headhouse, located behind the station building and plaza on South Lander Street.|$|E
