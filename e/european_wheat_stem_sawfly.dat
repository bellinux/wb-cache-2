Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) have been used successfully against other above-ground insect pests, and adding adjuvants to sprays containing EPNs has been shown to improve their effectiveness. We tested the hypothesis that adding chemical adjuvants to sprays containing EPNs will increase the ability of EPNs to enter <b>wheat</b> <b>stems</b> and kill diapausing WSS larvae.

Current pest management practices are inadequate and uncertainty regarding geographic origin, as well as limited data on population structure and dynamics across North America impede progress towards more informed management. We examined the genetic divergence between samples collected in North America and northeastern Asia, the assumed native range of C. cinctus using two mitochondrial regions (COI and 16 S). Subsequently, we characterized the structure of genetic diversity in the main wheat producing areas in North America {{using a combination of}} mtDNA marker and microsatellites in samples collected both in wheat fields and in grasses in wildlands. The strong genetic divergence observed between North American samples and Asian congeners, in particular the synonimized C. hyalinatus, did not support the hypothesis of a recent American colonization by C. cinctus. Furthermore, the relatively high genetic diversity both with mtDNA and microsatellite markers offered additional evidence in favor of the native American origin of this pest. The genetic diversity of North American populations is structured into three genetic clusters and these are highly correlated with geography. Regarding the recent southern outbreaks in North America, the results tend to exclude the hypothesis of recent movement of damaging <b>wheat</b> <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly</b> populations from the northern area.

Our study had two objectives: (i) assess levels of C. cinctus damage and larval C. cinctus mortality in wheat with the novel solid germplasm, conventional solid-stems and susceptible cultivars; and (ii) determine plant genotype effects on populations of C. cinctus parasitoid Bracon cephi (Gahan) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). The study was conducted in plots near Lethbridge, Alberta, Canada from 2003 – 2005. The novel solid-stemmed hexaploid G 9608 B 1 -L 12 J 11 BF 02, solid-stemmed AC Eatonia and hollow-stemmed durum AC Navigator reduced the infestation level and girdling damage by C. cinctus.

The lack of information about molecular mechanisms of WSS for defeating plant’s resistance prevents application of effective pest control strategies therefore, it is essential to identify the genes and their regulators behind WSS infestations. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized with their regulatory functions on gene expression, tuning protein production by controlling transcriptional and post-transcriptional activities. A transcriptome-guided approach was followed in order to identify miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNA of WSS, and their interaction networks. A total of 1, 893 were presented here as differentially expressed between larva and adult WSS insects. There were 11 miRNA families detected in WSS transcriptome. Together with the annotation of 1, 251 novel mRNAs, the amount of genetic information available for WSS was expanded. The network between WSS miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs suggested miRNA-mediated regulatory roles of lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs. In the light of the previous evidence that small RNA molecules of a pathogen could suppress the immune response of host plant, we analyzed the putative interactions between larvae and wheat at the miRNA level. Overall, this study provides a profile of larva and adult WSS life stages in terms of coding and non-coding elements. These findings also emphasize the potential roles of wheat and larval miRNAs in wheat resistance to infestation and in the suppression of resistance which is critical for the development of effective pest control strategies...|$|R

The declining cover {{of natural and}} semi-natural habitats, in particular, {{has been shown to}} reduce natural-enemy attack of crop pests, but also in some cases reduced crop colonization by such pests. In this study, we examined the influence of changes in two elements of landscape composition, natural grassland cover and cover of a highly suitable crop host, on infestation by a generalist insect pest in wheat, and parasitism of this pest by its dominant natural enemies. Surprisingly, we found no significant influences of increasing natural grassland habitat, at either local or landscape scales, on infestation by the <b>wheat</b> <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Cephus cinctus, or parasitism of this pest by the native parasitoid wasps, Bracon cephiand Bracon lissogaster.

This pattern was consistent across six study regions spanning three states in the northern Great Plains of North America, despite large differences in cropping systems and pest population densities across regions. Regional variation in pest infestation was best explained by long-term averages in precipitation, with higher C. cinctus infestation rates found in drier regions. Results suggest that landscape-mediated variation in pest pressure in this system is better explained by a direct response of pest insects to increasing cover of a highly suitable crop rather than an indirect response via reductions in natural enemies as natural habitat declines. The implication is that habitat diversification at the landscape scale could play a role in suppressing agricultural pest populations via reductions in area of suitable crop hosts...|$|R

40|$|The <b>wheat</b> <b>stem</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is {{a serious}} insect pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in the {{northern}} central Great Plains. The sawfly has been a pest of wheat in Montana, North Dakota, and Canada since the early 20 th century. It was first detected in Nebraska winter wheat in the early 1990 s, in Scotts Bluff County. The sawfly has since spread throughout the Nebraska Panhandle region and become a pest of serious concern. To {{gain a better understanding}} of the sawfly in Nebraska, investigations on the emergence, dispersal, and sampling of the sawfly were conducted. Observations on the emergence and dispersal of the adult sawfly were made in 2014 and 2015 in three winter wheat fields in the Nebraska Panhandle by using emergence cages, sticky traps, and sweep net sampling. Adult sawflies begin emerging in mid-May and are no longer found by the end of June. Adult sawfly densities decreased the farther into the wheat that was sampled. This edge effect was observed for both sexes of the sawfly, but it is more apparent with male sawflies. The adult sawfly has an aggregated distribution when described by Taylor’s Power Law. By using Taylor’s Power Law, the number of sweep net samples required to maintain a desired precision level was determined. When sampling at early wheat heading, five, 20 -sweep sweep net samples are needed to maintain a 20 % precision level. These sampling data were correlated to larval infestation rates and used to develop a sampling plan that predicts larval infestation rates based upon stem density and the number of adults sampled. Sampling adults gives wheat growers ample time to take management action, such as swathing, during the current growing season. It also allows time for growers to change their wheat variety to a more resistant, solid <b>stem</b> <b>wheat</b> variety, for the next growing season. Advisors: Jeffery D. Bradshaw and Gary L.

However, new races of this pathogen have emerged that overcome many important <b>wheat</b> <b>stem</b> rust resistance genes, and their spread toward important areas of wheat production threatens global wheat production.

Using bulked segregant analysis, next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics approaches, seven quantitative trait loci were found to contribute to nonhost stem rust resistance in a recombinant inbred population derived from a cross between two Brachypodium genotypes with differing levels of resistance.

More recently, new epidemics of stem rust caused by a different race of Pgt have been reported in Germany and Ethiopia (2013 – 2014...|$|R
