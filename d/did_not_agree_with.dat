5|$|During {{the early}} 1020s, Maymandi urged Mahmud to invade Jibal, {{which was then}} {{under the control of}} the young Buyid ruler Majd al-Dawla. However, the real ruler of the region was Majd al-Dawla's mother Sayyida Shirin, which was already known by the neighbors of the Buyids, {{including}} the Ghaznavids. Mahmud, however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him, because he did not feel his empire threatened because of a woman ruling in the region.|$|E

5|$|Sanchez {{became the}} first USC quarterback to leave school early for the NFL since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season. During the press conference, head coach Pete Carroll {{made it clear that}} he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Sanchez's decision, and advised him of the low success-rate of quarterbacks who left college early. Despite the public disagreement, the two {{remained}} close afterward.|$|E
5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Lombard's Christology, or views {{on the nature of}} Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he disagreed with some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used by then. He thought {{that it had been}} a good measure in the past but had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while delaRúa supported it.|$|E

5|$|After {{a winter}} filled with Indian attacks, {{including}} one which claimed {{the life of}} Shelby's younger brother Evan Shelby III, Kentucky militia units won some minor victories over the Indians in early 1794. In spring the response to Wayne's call for troops was more enthusiastic; 1,600 volunteers mustered at Fort Greenville and were hastily trained. By August, 1794, Wayne was on the offensive against the Indians and dealt them a decisive blow at the August 20, 1794 Battle of Fallen Timbers. This victory, and the ensuing Treaty of Greenville, secured the territory, and although Shelby <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> some of the restrictions placed upon western settlers by this treaty, he abided by its terms and enforced those that were under his jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant that drinking could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Segrè began {{studying}} the Zeeman effect in certain alkaline metals. When his progress stalled because the diffraction grating he required to continue {{was not available}} in Italy, he wrote to four laboratories elsewhere in Europe asking for assistance and received an invitation from Pieter Zeeman to finish his work at Zeeman's laboratory in Amsterdam. Segrè was awarded a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship and, on Fermi's advice, elected {{to use it to}} study under Otto Stern in Hamburg. Working with Otto Frisch on space quantization produced results that apparently <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the current theory; but Isidor Isaac Rabi showed that theory and experiment were in agreement if the nuclear spin of potassium was +1/2.|$|E

5|$|In December 1940 Bacher {{joined the}} Radiation Laboratory at MIT, {{but did not}} {{immediately}} cease his research. He reached an arrangement with its director, Lee Alvin DuBridge, to return to Cornell for four days every three weeks until it was completed. He was researching the neutron cross section of cadmium, a topic of interest to Enrico Fermi, who was attempting {{to build a nuclear}} reactor, but whose figures <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Bacher's. Bacher carefully checked his results, and Fermi, convinced of their correctness, urged Bacher to publish them. Bacher submitted a paper to the Physical Review with instructions to withhold publication until after the war, and the paper was not published until 1946.|$|E
5|$|Morehead {{moved to}} Louisville in 1859 {{and formed a}} law {{partnership}} with his nephew, Charles M. Briggs. In February 1861, he attended the Peace Conference of 1861 that tried to resolve the sectional differences between the states. In May 1861, he was chosen as a delegate to the Border State Convention, an ultimately futile attempt to avert the Civil War. Morehead refused to sign the final document produced by the convention because he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> all the statements it contained. He was an advocate of Kentucky's position of neutrality, but was personally sympathetic to the South and was {{an outspoken critic of}} the Lincoln administration. He condemned Secretary of State William H. Seward for cutting off trade with the South.|$|E
5|$|When {{he assumed}} his Senate seat in 1855, Crittenden was sixty-nine years old, the eldest {{member of that}} body. The Whig Party had {{practically}} dissolved by this time, and he joined many of his fellow Kentuckians in associating with the Know Nothing Party. Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> all of the party's principles, he would not associate with the Democrats, the party he {{had spent much of}} his career denouncing, nor would he associate with the new Republican Party because of their stance against slavery. Despite his misgivings about some of the party platform, he campaigned on behalf of Millard Fillmore, the party's candidate in the 1856 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Because Lichfield {{had been}} {{established}} by the papacy, any change in its status required papal assent. Coenwulf's first embassy to Leo III in 797 about demoting Lichfield did not succeed, mainly because Leo seems to have resented the implied criticism of his predecessor Hadrian I, who had approved the elevation of Lichfield. Coenwulf's embassy bore {{a letter to the}} pope that asked for papal advice on how to resolve the problems surrounding Lichfield and Canterbury. The letter reminded the papacy of Pope Gregory the Great's old scheme to have two metropolitans in Britain, one in the north and one in the south, with the southern one being based in London. The letter implied that Coenwulf was asking for Æthelhard's metropolitan see to be moved to London. The same embassy carried a letter from Æthelhard also, which has not survived. The pope, however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the embassy. The papal reply to Coenwulf stated that the southern archbishopric must remain at Canterbury, as well as excommunicated Eadberht and authorised his expulsion from Kent if he persisted in keeping Æthelhard from Canterbury.|$|E
5|$|Giovanni Pacioni and Giorgio Lalli {{described}} the forms roseus and vinosus from Italy in 2003; roseus has a greyish-whitish cap discolouration, while f. vinosus has a less clearly zonate cap that lacks green tones, and gills with a lilac-pinkish sheen. However, form vinosus, originally described by Lucien Quélet as a variety (Lactarius sanguifluus var. vinosus) in 1881, was invalid, because Quélet's basionym was an illegitimate nomenclatural synonym {{of a species}} named in 1855 by Jean-Baptiste Barla. Later authors <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the delimitation of these forms as distinct taxa, suggesting that the alternations in appearance represent normal morphological variations brought about by differences in age, and environmental factors such as levels of sunlight and humidity. Lactarius vinosus has often been considered as a variety of L.sanguifluus, but morphological (especially macroscopic characters and spore-ornamentation) and molecular evidence (based on internal transcribed spacer-sequencing) has confirmed that they are separate species.|$|E
5|$|The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 {{created the}} Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) {{to take over}} the {{functions}} and assets of the Manhattan Project. President Harry S. Truman appointed its five commissioners on 28 October 1946, and Groves appointed Nichols as the military liaison officer to the AEC. Nichols' main responsibility was to help organize an orderly transfer of assets and responsibilities from the MED to the AEC. Military aspects were taken over by the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP). It was generally assumed that Nichols would become the AEC's Director of Military Application, but while Nichol's relationship with the AEC was cordial and the commissioners were impressed with his administrative skills, it also became clear that Nichols <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the commissioners' concept of the Director of Military Application as a staff rather than a line function.|$|E

50|$|This {{responsibility}} {{refers to}} the responsibility of ministers to accept and defend the decisions made jointly by the Parliament even if a minister <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the decision. While a Minister is free to introduce an opposing viewpoint for debate in Parliament, once a decision is taken by the Parliament, all ministers are bound {{to abide by the}} decision. A minister who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> a Parliamentary decision should resign.|$|R
5|$|A {{declaration}} is only {{as effective}} as the willingness of a public body to abide by the court's statement of the law in it, as it is not a contempt of court to ignore a declaration. In Webster v. Southwark London Borough Council (1982), Webster was a parliamentary candidate for the National Front, a far right racial nationalist political party, who wanted to hold an election meeting in a hall owned by Southwark London Borough Council. Despite being required by provisions of the Representation of the People Act 1949 to permit Webster to use the hall, the local council refused to do so as it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Webster's political views. The court made a declaration that Webster was legally entitled to use the hall at a certain time for the purpose of his election campaign, {{on the assumption that the}} local council would obey it. Nonetheless, the local council still refused to allow Webster use of the hall. It was held that a declaration is not a coercive order of the court and, accordingly, refusal to comply with it is not contempt.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Nadzab, General Sir Thomas Blamey, the Allied Land Forces commander, {{intended}} to exploit his success with an advance {{into the upper}} Markham Valley, which would protect Nadzab from Japanese ground attack, {{and serve as a}} jumping off point for an overland advance into the Ramu Valley to capture airfield sites there. On 16 September 1943—the same day that Lae fell—Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, commander of I Corps, Major General George Alan Vasey, commander of the 7th Division, and Major General Ennis Whitehead, commander of the Advanced Echelon, Fifth Air Force, met at Whitehead's headquarters. Whitehead wanted fighter airstrips established in the Kaiapit area by 1 November 1943 in order to bring short-range fighters within range of the major Japanese base at Wewak. The 7th Division's mission was to prevent the Japanese at Madang from using the Markham and Ramu valleys to threaten Lae or Nadzab. Vasey and Herring considered both an overland operation to capture Dumpu, and an airborne operation using paratroops of the US Army's 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. Blamey <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> their idea of capturing Dumpu first, insisting that Kaiapit be taken beforehand.|$|E
5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. He {{thought of himself as}} an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown there through a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E
