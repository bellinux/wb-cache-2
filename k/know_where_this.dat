25|$|I don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> will lead, if anywhere, but {{the right}} thing is {{to sit down and}} have these conversations and see if we want our {{championship}} in more than eight cities or do we like playing exclusively in domes. None of the cities where we play our championship is named New York, Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago or Miami. We don't play on a campus. We play in professional football arenas.|$|E

I know very roughly where I am going... I am continuing my research and I really do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> story will lead me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clough states [...] "But looking back, sure, I wish I {{had taken}} more time. We {{have a lot}} of friends who felt left out. We needed to spend more time letting our friends <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> was going. I regret that." ...|$|E
5|$|The dates {{given for}} {{construction}} {{are often not}} exactly <b>known.</b> <b>Where</b> <b>this</b> is the case the century of first construction of the existing building is given.|$|R
60|$|Now in {{his heart}} Walter Lodloe blessed his {{guardian}} angel that she had prompted {{him to make the}} announcement of his destination before he <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> lady was going.|$|R
5000|$|A rumour {{spread in}} the Norwegian press that the NME had called gay against you [...] "the new shit", leading to reporters {{unexpectedly}} attending their Norwegian shows requesting interviews; no-one <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> rumour originated.|$|R
60|$|Paula was silent. 'Do you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> {{young man}} Dare {{is at the}} present moment?' she asked quickly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> house o' Dutton's is?" [...] {{said the}} driver, {{to the man}} who had once taken either dinner or supper there.|$|E

5000|$|Hami'atin is a Quranic Arabic word (Arabic: [...] ) {{that means}} [...] "Dark Mud". This name {{is given by}} Muslims to the land where Zulqarnain first arrived. He stated that the sun sets in Marcy water. No one <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> place is located.|$|R
50|$|The {{outcome of}} the battle is known; when Olaf realises that the battle is lost, he leaps {{overboard}} together with his surviving men. It is not <b>known</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> battle took place, with it being doubtful whether there ever was an island called Svolder.|$|R
6000|$|... "They don't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> place is. Billings {{is certain}} the oldest miners {{never heard of}} the drift; he thinks it was made years before the {{workings}} were opened at Farley's." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{another of}} the Directors spoke. [...] "We do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> lady is to be found. She is {{probably}} passing under another name. It is not our business to hunt her down." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, 'p'raps you're {{a little}} right, and p'raps you're a little wrong--a little of both, Nickleby. I want to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> beauty lives, that I may have another peep at her, Nickleby.' ...|$|E
5000|$|On 28 October 1956 a {{radio station}} calling itself [...] "Romania of the future. The voice of resistance" [...] began {{broadcasting}} on different wavelengths.

6000|$|... "And {{now wants}} to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> terrible {{necklace}} is at this present moment." [...] He paused a moment, but Lizzie did not answer him. [...] "I suppose you {{have no objection to}} telling me where it is." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "They must be good, then, {{though it}} was a woman brought tidings of them," [...] said Raoul, smiling grimly at his own wit; then, leaving the mews, he demanded to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> famous falcon-merchant was to be met withal.|$|E

6000|$|... "True, I {{forgot that}} circumstance. The more {{numerous}} the crimes and the criminals, {{the greater the}} probability of impunity; and this, too, not on the general principle that power cannot be resisted, but on the particular principle that a thousand or two votes are of vast importance, where three thousand can turn an election. God only <b>knows</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> thing is to end!" ...|$|R
50|$|The gang is now up {{to finding}} an old bunker from World War II, in the {{southern}} parts of Norway. after the leader Egon has found a map leading to the old General's treasure, a suitcase of dollar bills and a safe containing gold bars.

6000|$|... 'I sent Jenkins to old Nickleby before {{eight o'clock}} this morning. He's a staunch one; {{he was back}} with me before the messenger.

But there's no need to talk; {{tomorrow}} will soon be here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Fear!’ {{said the}} little man: ‘isn’t it a lovely {{thing to see}} him and his wife a going up in one balloon, and his own son and his wife a jostling up against them in another, and all of them going twenty or thirty mile in three hours or so, and then coming back in pochayses?

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Silas, meditatively. [...] "Yes--the {{door was}} open. The money's gone I don't <b>know</b> <b>where,</b> and <b>this</b> is come from I don't know where." ...|$|R
50|$|According to Bazini, {{the next}} album {{might be a}} hybrid, ‘The accessibly of the first album, mixed with {{the depth of the}} second album. Or it might be {{something}} entirely different.

How great is that? Pretty great, we assume.|$|R

60|$|After Uncle 'Rasmus {{had taken}} care of the {{provisions}} we brought, by stowing them in a poor apology for a cupboard near {{the side of the}} fireplace, he insisted that we lads go out and look about the town, claiming that the time might come when it would be much to our advantage to <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> regiment or that legion was quartered, and insisting also that we must show ourselves as curious, rather than hugging the hovel so closely.|$|E
60|$|Reverend {{and dear}} Sir,--As I hear nothing of your motions, {{but that you}} are, or were, out of town, I do not <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> may find you, or whether it will find you at all. I wrote you a long letter, dated {{from the land of}} matrimony, in June; but either it had not found you, or, what I dread more, it found you or Mrs. Blacklock in too {{precarious}} a state of health and spirits to take notice of an idle packet.|$|E
60|$|By good luck, Jone {{had some}} {{business}} {{to attend to}} about money and rooms on the steamer, and so forth, and so I could start out by myself without his even asking me where I was going. Now, of course, {{it would be a}} natural thing for a person to go and seek out his ancestors in the ancient village from which they sprang, and to read their names on the tombstones in the venerable little church, but as I didn't <b>know</b> <b>where</b> <b>this</b> village was, of course I couldn't go to it. But in London is the place where you can find out how to find out such things.|$|E
