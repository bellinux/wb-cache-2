5000|$|Water-in-oil (w/o) {{emulsions}} {{are created}} by mixing aqueous and oil phases {{with the help of}} surfactants. A typical IVC emulsion is formed by first generating oil-surfactant mixture by stirring, and then gradually adding the aqueous phase to the oil-surfactant mixture. For stable emulsion formation, a mixture of HLB (<b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance)</b> and low HLB surfactants are needed. Some combinations of surfactants used to generate oil-surfactant mixture are mineral oil / 0.5% Tween 80 / 4.5% Span 80 / sodium deoxycholate and a more heat stable version, light mineral oil / 0.4% Tween 80 / 4.5% Span 80 / 0.05% Triton X-100. The aqueous phase containing transcription and/or translation components is slowly added to the oil surfactants, and the formation of w/o is facilitated by homogenizing, stirring or using hand extruding device.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the critical <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> (HLB) of licuri oil, and to perform a clinical assay to evaluate its hydrating effects. For the determination of the HLB, serial emulsions were prepared with the oil. Regarding the clinical study, 13 human subjects were recruited to evaluate the hydrating power of the emulsified preparation containing licuri oil, and comparing it with the same preparation containing sweet almond oil (SAO). The critical HLB of licuri oil was represented by the zones within the concentrations of 10 % for the oil and 15 % for the pair of tensoactive agents, with a value of 11. 8. Both preparations showed similar hydrating power. We propose that licuri oil can be considered a new lipophilic adjuvant with hydrating characteristics, which can be used in cosmetic preparations, replacing consecrated oils, such as SAO...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{surfactants}} on the hydrolysis of prochiral and chiral substrates by crude and purified porcine pancreatic lipase (PPL, EC 3. 1. 1. 3)) has been studied. Rather than accelerating the reactions, surfactants slowed down (''inhibited'') the reactions {{relative to the}} rate {{in the absence of}} surfactant. Surfactants varied in {{the extent to which the}} reaction was inhibited. With the crude enzyme there was a correlation between degree of inhibition and the optical purity of the product of hydrolysis of an achiral diester substrate 1. There was no special effect associated with use of surfactants in the concentration range corresponding to critical micelle formation, nor was there any increase in rate of reaction when stable emulsions were formed by using mixtures of surfactants to generate an appropriate <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> (HLB) <b>balance.</b> A study of the effect of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) on the hydrolysis of the diester 1 by crude PPL showed that the rate of the reaction steadily decreased with increasing surfactant concentration, but that the optical purity of the product first fell and then rose gain, an effect attributed to the differential denaturing action of the surfactant on at least three hydrolytic enzymes. In general, there would seem to be no advantage to be gained from the use of surfactants in the hydrolysis by PPL of compounds of low water solubility; the use of an immiscible co-solvent is more effective...|$|R

The results show that, when the phase inversion was started from either a single-phase microemulsion (D) or a two-phase W+D equilibrium, the resulting droplet sizes were close to those predicted by the model, whereas, when emulsification was started from W+D+O or from W+D+L alpha (L alpha = lamellar liquid crystal) equilibria, {{the difference between the}} measured and predicted values was much higher. The structural changes produced during the phase inversion process have been investigated by the H- 1 -PFGSE-NMR technique, monitoring the self-diffusion coefficients for each component as a function of temperature.

40|$|International audienceThis article {{describes}} the preparation of capsules displaying craters at their surfaces and independent holes inside their membranes. These poly(methylmethacrylate) capsules of 20 to 200 m diameter are prepared by a solvent evaporation process and typically contain a dispersant, polyvinyl alcohol, and an excipient, namely, a fatty acid triglyceride (miglyol 812). Spectroscopic methods showed that, depending on the miglyol content, the craters at the surface exhibited sizes of about 1 to 2 m, whereas the core structure of the membrane changed significantly, typically from "soft-part-of-bread" up to "foamed"-like aspects. Among several spectroscopy techniques, confocal fluorescence microscopy confirmed that the capsules retained the miglyol in their core {{and not in the}} craters or holes, even after centrifugation and handling. This technique also showed that holes in the membrane are filled with water. A possible analysis of the "foaming" phenomenon based on the surface tensions of different oils, as well as their optimal <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> (HLBO), is added to generalize the concept...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{proteins}} encapsulated by detergent micelles {{are widely}} used for structural study. Because of their amphipathic property, detergents {{have the ability to}} maintain protein solubility and stability in an aqueous medium. However, conventional detergents have serious limitations in their scope and utility, particularly for eukaryotic membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes. Thus, a number of new agents have been devised; some have made significant contributions to membrane protein structural studies. However, few detergent design principles are available. In this study, we prepared meta and ortho isomers of the previously reported para-substituted xylene-linked maltoside amphiphiles (XMAs), along with alkyl chain-length variation. The isomeric XMAs were assessed with three membrane proteins, and the meta isomer with a C 12 alkyl chain was most effective at maintaining solubility/stability of the membrane proteins. We propose that interplay between the <b>hydrophile–lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> (HLB) and alkyl chain length is of central importance for high detergent efficacy. In addition, differences in inter-alkyl-chain distance between the isomers influence the ability of the detergents to stabilise membrane proteins...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop and {{characterize}} a Brazil nut oil microemulsion system and determine the effect of this microemulsion on the superoxide release in human phagocytes. The microemulsion was formulated using distilled water, Brazil nut as the oily phase, Sorbitan monooleate, Polysorbate 80, and butan- 1 -ol. <b>Hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> of Brazil nut oil was determined, pseudoternary diagrams were prepared, and microemulsion diagram regions were preselected. Preliminary and accelerated stability tests, rheological characterization and dynamic light scattering were performed. The immunomodulatory effect of the microemulsion on the interactions with leukocytes was determined by superoxide release. The developed formulations were classified as oil-in-water, showed a Newtonian profile, with linear viscosity and droplet sizes of 46. 9; 66. 5 and 34. 3 nm. When we assessed the interaction of the microemulsion of Brazil nut oil with phagocytes, we observed an increase in superoxide release.

METHOD: Eight pseudoternary phase triangles, containing ethyl oleate as the oil component and a mixture of two nonionic surfactants and n-alcohol or 1, 2 -alkanediol as a cosurfactant, were constructed and used for training, testing, and validation purposes. A total of 21 molecular descriptors were calculated for each cosurfactant. A genetic algorithm was used to select important molecular descriptors, and a supervised artificial neural network with two hidden layers was used to correlate selected descriptors and the weight ratio of components in the system with the observed phase behavior. RESULTS: The results proved the dominant role of the chemical composition, <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance,</b> length of hydrocarbon chain, molecular volume, and hydrocarbon volume of cosurfactant.

The receptor was expressed using stably transfected HEK 293 cells at a concentration of 44 pmol functional receptor per milligram membrane protein and purified using over 50 different nonionic surfactants. A strong correlation was observed between a surfactant's ability to remove A 3 from the membrane {{and the ability of}} the surfactant to remove A 3 selectively relative to other membrane proteins. The activity of A 3 once purified also correlates well with the selectivity of the surfactant used.

This paper describes a methodology to characterize frothers by relating impact on bubble size reduction represented by CCC (critical coalescence concentration) to frother structure represented by HLB (<b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance).</b> Thirty-six surfactants were tested from three frother families: Aliphatic Alcohols, Polypropylene Glycol Alkyl Ethers and Polypropylene Glycols, covering a range in alkyl groups (represented by n, the number of carbon atoms) and number of Propylene Oxide groups (represented by m). The Sauter mean size (D 32) was derived from bubble size distribution measured in a 0. 8 m 3 mechanical flotation cell. The D 32 vs. concentration data were fitted to a 3 -parameter model to determine CCC 95, the concentration giving 95 % reduction in bubble size compared to water only. It was shown that each family exhibits a unique CCC 95 -HLB relationship dependent on n and m. Empirical models were developed to predict CCC 95 either from HLB or directly from n and m. Commercial frothers of known family were shown to fit the relationships. Use of the model to predict D 32 is illustrated...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{a series of}} as-synthesized palm-based {{nonionic}} surfactants with various <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> values were successfully synthesized. The critical micelle concentration and the Gibbs energy of the surfactants were determined and discussed. For the first time, the surfactants were used to stabilize three-component olein oil-in-water high internal phase emulsions, with an oil volume fraction of 0. 85, and which were easily prepared by one-pot homogenization. Proof of high stability was confirmed by the satisfactory rheological profiles and further enhanced by a three-month storage exercise at an elevated temperature which showed no significant physical and rheological changes. These results suggest that low concentration of the surfactants efficiently stabilized the emulsions with high content of oil. Based on the optical micrograph observation, an average droplet size of less than 10 Â Î¼m increased with increasing ethylene oxide chain length and temperature. The varying degree of viscosity resulted from the various ethylene oxide chain lengths of the surfactants. The hydration efficacy of the emulsions was examined in vivo using a corneometer.

The tests were conducted in shaking water baths using 250 -ml erlenmeyer flasks in statistical experimental design formats. The addition of nonionic surfactants increased copper extraction in the ferric sulfate leaching of chalcopyrite when sufficient fe 3 + was present. A positive interaction between fe 3 + concentration and surfactant concentration was demonstrated.

The surfactants are monodistributed polyoxy- ethylene glycol n-dodecyl ether. They {{are used as}} model mixtures of two, three, or five compounds or as constituents of a commercial surfactant. It is found that the phase diagrams of these systems are bent gradually toward the highest temperatures as the global surfactant concentration decreases. Each phase diagram is well-characterized by {{the curve of the}} HLB (<b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance)</b> temperature versus the global surfactant concentration. For any fixed global surfactant concentration, this temperature is the middle temperature of the three-phase region; it can be calculated from an additive rule of the HLB temperatures of the surfactants weighted by their mole fractions at the water/oil interface. These mole fractions are determined through the pseudophase model using surfactant partitioning. Calculations require the knowledge of the critical micelle concentration, the partition coefficient between water and oil, and the HLB temperature of each surfactant of the mixture. This treatment can be used to correctly predict the variation of the HLB temperatures of the surfactant mixtures studied versus the global surfactant concentration.

40|$|Wool {{scouring}} effluent is {{a highly}} polluted industrial wastewater in which the main pollutant, wool wax, is held in a stable oil-in-water emulsion by non-ionic detergent. The use of microbial action to cause emulsion destabilisation has been proposed as a new treatment strategy for this effluent stream. This strategy aims at improving aerobic treatment performance by physically removing the high-COD, slowly bio-degradable wool wax from the system without bio-degradation. The mechanism by which an aerobic-mixed culture destabilises the wool scouring effluent emulsion was investigated. Our results show that destabilisation is due to partial bio-degradation of both the scouring detergent and the wool wax. Cleavage of the wool wax esters was the first stage in wax degradation, when 40 - 50 % of wax was de-emulsified. Over the same period, detergent degradation was low, at 7 - 21 %. With further incubation, detergent degradation increased, aiding further breakdown of the emulsion. The degradation of the detergent, a nonylphenol ethoxylate, resulted in both a reduction in molar concentration (of up to 82 %) and a shortening of the ethoxylate chain length. The latter reduced the <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> (HLB) from 12 to approximately 7, thereby reducing {{the ability of the}} residual detergent to stabilise the emulsion. Analysis of the emulsified and de-emulsified wax fractions could not identify a group of compounds that were preferentially de-emulsified based on molecular weight or polarity.

Regardless of the type of emulsifier (i.e., PVA and SDS), increasing the emulsifier content below the critical micelles concentration (CMC) would reduce the microPCM size due to the reduction of surface energy at the oil-to-water interface by the surfactant. However, further increase in emulsifier content above this threshold concentration would result in larger microPCM sizes. This {{can be attributed to the}} tendency of PVA molecules to form micelles among themselves. Furthermore, while the high <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> of SDS led to smoother microPCM surfaces, its high solubilizing capability also led to the dissolution of PA in the aqueous phase. This resulted in the loss of PA and very poor encapsulation efficiency. Therefore, SDS was not a proper surfactant for PA-PLA microcapsules. In short, successful fabrication of 100 % bio-based microPCM is expected to promote further the environmental sustainability of the already environmentally friendly latent heat energy storage technology.|$|E
40|$|Coenzyme Q 10 (CoQ 10) is an {{essential}} component in the electron-transport systems of mitochondria and bacteria and is often used as a supplementary treatment for some diseases. We previously reported that the bioavailability of CoQ 10 powder was less than 10 %. In this study, we investigated various preparations to improve the intestinal absorption of CoQ 10 with focus {{on the effect of}} emulsification. We prepared a suspension and some emulsions with four types of surfactants and investigated the plasma concentration profile after oral administration to rats. The absorption of CoQ 10 was improved by an emulsion formulation although there was little absorption of CoQ 10 when a suspension was administered. However, little CoQ 10 was absorbed in the bile duct-ligated group even when the emulsion formulation was administered (about 50 % of the control group). Bile and emulsion formulation are essential for absorption of CoQ 10. When the preparations containing Tween 20 (polysorbate (20) sorbitan monolaurate) and Tween 80 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan monooleate) were administered, plasma concentrations of CoQ 10 were higher than those obtained with preparations containing Tween 65 (polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan tristearate) and Span 20 (sorbitan monolaurate). Tween 20 and Tween 80 have higher <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> (HLB) values than those Tween 65 and Span 20. Our study suggests that highly lipophilic compounds like CoQ 10 would diffuse the unstirred water layer and would easily access the intestinal apical membrane by an emulsion containing a surfactant with a high HLB value. Attention must be given to CoQ 10 supplementation for patients whose bile is not excreted to the intestine such as patients with cholestasis...|$|E
40|$|Sucrose esters (SE) are {{surfactants}} {{with potential}} pharmaceutical applications {{because of their}} low toxicity, biocompatibility, and excellent biodegradability. The objective {{of the study was}} to investigate SE as alternative surfactants in stabilizing emulsions for the preparation of protein-loaded microparticles. To achieve this goal, using bovine serum albumin as model protein and 75 / 25 poly(d, 1 -lactide-co-glycolide) as polymer carrier, we have investigated the influence of the following formulation variables on particle characteristics: (1) SE concentration from 0. 01 % to 1 % (wt/vol), (2) <b>hydrophile-lipophile</b> <b>balance</b> (HLB) value of SE from 6 to 15, and (3) the nature of emulsion stabilizer. The formulations were characterized using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, bicinchoninic acid protein assay, optical microscopy and SDS-PAGE. Results showed that at 0. 05 % (wt/vol) surfactant concentration, SE with HLB of 6 to 15 provided discrete and spherical microparticles with the highest encapsulation efficiency compared with controls polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and poloxamer 188. These results may be explained by the difference in critical micelle concentration, diffusion, and partition coefficient among the tested surfactants. HLB values were consistent with SE spectral data. The protein molecular weight was preserved after the encapsulation process. The effective SE concentration was far less (20 -to 200 -fold) than that is usually required for PVA in microencapsulation of proteins. However, the encapsulation efficiency was relatively lower (∼ 13. 5 %). These preliminary results suggest that it may be desirable to optimize such formulations in vitro and in vivo for SE to be eventually used as altermative surfactants in the development of microparticulate systems for parenteral delivery of protein and gene medicines...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to research the effect of different surfactants on the water vapor permeability and physical properties of edible films made from tapioca starch/decolorized hsian-tsao leaf gum(dHG). The film-forming solution was made from tapioca starch/ dHG {{at a ratio of}} 1. 7 / 0. 3, and with 20 % glycerol as plasticizer based on the weight of starch/dHG. Surfactants used in this study include glyceryl monostearate (GMS), Span 80, Tween 80, lecithin and sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) at different concentrations (5 %, 10 %, 20 % and 25 % of the total solid content). Starch/dHG composite films were obtained by casting. The results implied that the films with GMS showed the best water vapor barrier properties among all films in this study, and the barrier propeties significantly increased with increasing GMS. However, addition of Tween 80 could not improve the water vapor barrier properties of the cassava starch/dHG films. In addition, the thickness of films increased with increasing surfactant, but a decreasing tendency was observed in tensile strength and tensile strain at break. SEM of the starch/dHG/surfactant composite films revealed that the arrangement of surfactants molecules in the film and interaction between surfactant and starch/dHG modified the microstructure of starch/dHG film. In other words, the addition of different surfactants made the water vapor barrier and physical properties of starch/dHG film change significantly. 本實驗研究的目的為探討不同界面活性劑對樹薯澱粉/脫色仙草葉膠(dHG) 可食膜水氣阻隔與物性的影響。樹薯澱粉/dHG 以 1. 7 / 0. 3 的比例形成固形物為 2 %的可食膜溶液，以甘油為塑化劑，食用級乳化劑作為界面活性劑，包含單甘油硬脂酸 (glyceryl monostearate) 、Span 80 、Tween 80 、卵磷脂 (lecithin) 、乳酸硬脂酸鈉 (sodium stearoyl lactylate) 等五種，濃度為 5 %、 10 %、 20 %、 25 %，並以鑄模法 (casting) 製得樹薯澱粉/dHG/surfactant 複合膜。研究結果發現，添加單甘油硬脂酸(GMS) 對可食膜的水氣阻隔性有最好的效果，並且隨濃度上升有顯著性的增加，其次是乳酸硬脂酸鈉 (SSL) 及卵磷脂 (lecithin) ，但Tween 80 及 Span 80 則對水氣的阻隔並沒有改善。在對樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜物性影響方面，界面活性劑的添加雖然使厚度增加，但一般而言卻降低了可食膜的透明度、抗張強度及抗張形變量。由掃描式電子顯微鏡結果顯示，界面活性劑的添加因其分子排列及與澱粉/dHG 分子的交互作用，造成樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜的細微結構改變，也因此導致樹薯澱粉/dHG 可食膜的水氣阻隔及機械強度等性質產生變化。摘要	i Abstract	ii 目錄	iii 圖目錄	vii 壹、	前言	 1 貳、	文獻回顧	 3 一、	可食膜 (edible film) 	 3 (一) 	背景及定義	 3 (二) 	可食膜的組成份	 5 1. 	碳水化合物	 5 2. 	蛋白質	 6 3. 	脂質	 6 4. 	塑化劑 (plasticizer) 	 7 二、	可食膜的製備及應用	 8 三、	樹薯澱粉可食膜	 9 四、	仙草葉膠	 11 五、	樹薯澱粉/脫色仙草葉膠 (dHG) 可食膜	 15 六、	界面活性劑	 17 (一) 	HLB值 (<b>Hydrophile-Lipophile</b> <b>Balance)</b> 	 19 (二) 	臨界微胞濃度 (critical micelle concentration，CMC) 	 20 (三) 	食品上的乳化劑	 20 七、	等溫吸濕曲線 (Moisture sorption isotherm, MSI) 	 22 八、	可食膜的機械性質 (Mechanical Properties) 	 26 九、	水氣透過性質	 30 參、	材料與方法	 33 一、	仙草葉	 33 二、	澱粉	 33 三、	甘油	 33 四、	界面活性劑	 33 (一) 	Tween 80 	 35 (二) 	Span 80 	 35 (三) 	Lecithin	 35 (四) 	Glyceryl monostearate (GMS) 	 35 (五) 	Sodium stearoyl lactylate (SSL) 	 35 五、	脫色仙草葉膠之萃取、化學成分及分子量	 37 (一) 	仙草葉膠之萃取及脫色	 37 (二) 	基本成分分析	 37 1. 	水分含量	 37 2. 	灰份 (ash) 測定	 38 3. 	粗脂肪 (crude fat) 測定	 38 4. 	粗蛋白測定	 39 5. 	粗纖維 (crude fiber) 測定	 39 (三) 	金屬離子含量測定	 40 (四) 	醣醛酸含量測定	 41 (五) 	脫色仙草葉膠分子量分佈	 42 六、	可食膜溶液及可食膜之製備	 43 (一) 	可食膜溶液製備	 43 (二) 	可食膜製備	 44 七、	可食膜性質測定	 44 (一) 	可食膜溶液快速黏度分析	 44 (二) 	厚度測定	 45 (三) 	水分含量	 45 (四) 	等溫吸濕曲線	 46 (五) 	水氣透過性	 47 (六) 	穿刺試驗	 48 (七) 	抗張試驗	 48 (八) 	場發射掃描式電子顯微鏡結構觀察	 49 (九) 	不透明度分析	 49 八、	統計分析	 50 肆、	結果與討論	 51 一、	脫色仙草葉膠化學組成份	 51 二、	快速黏度分析	 54 三、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜外觀	 62 四、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜厚度及含水量	 64 五、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜不透明度分析	 67 六、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜微結構觀察	 72 七、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜等溫吸濕曲線	 76 八、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜水氣透過性(WVP) 	 81 九、	樹薯澱粉/dHG/界面活性劑可食膜機械性質	 88 (一) 	穿刺試驗	 88 (二) 	抗張強度試驗	 89 伍、	結論	 99 陸、	參考文獻	 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of a ‘stable’ emulsion {{is more of an}} art than a science. Emulsions are inherently unstable heterogenous systems such that a truly stable emulsion is not feasible. However, commercial emulsions are very common indicating {{that it is possible to}} achieve a ‘commercially stable’ emulsion. A commercially stable emulsion can be defined as one that remains homogenous throughout its commercial life. Emulsions provide an aesthetically pleasing and practical method of forming a homogenous mixture of oil and water. This type of product is very common with examples including milk, mayonnaise, cosmetic creams and paints. Despite the very many emulsion products available and the considerable time and effort spent on research, there is still no definitive technique available that can pinpoint an emulsifier or emulsifier combination that will form a guaranteed ‘commercially stable’ emulsion. Trial and error is still required in emulsion formulation. The techniques that are available to help reduce the number of emulsifier options that should be considered have been outlined in this thesis. One, the <b>Hydrophile-Lipophile</b> <b>Balance</b> (HLB) is well known to the emulsification industry and very popular. The benefits and the limitations of this technique are reviewed along with the modifications and extensions of the technique that have been proposed throughout its 50 year life. It is important to note that the HLB technique is over 50 years old. The commercial demands of emulsion products have developed considerably in this time and emulsion systems tend to be somewhat more complex with more ingredients required than when this technique was first formulated. A fresh approach to emulsifier selection is desirable and this work proposes a new concept called the Emulsion Phase Matching or EPM technique. The name arises from the fact that, in this technique, each phase of the emulsion is considered independently of the other, although with all auxiliary ingredients included. A quantitative measure of the ‘difference’ between the two phases to be emulsified (in this case interfacial tension) is ‘matched’ to the difference between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties of the emulsifier to be used. A good match should correlate to a ‘stable’ emulsion. The data should ultimately be listed in a database to make this task simpler. However, the scope of the current work was to test the concept, in general, and the use of interfacial tension, in specific, as the measure of difference. Interfacial tension was, indeed, found to be linked to emulsion stability. Test emulsions were designed to test the proposed EPM technique and to compare the results with those emulsions that would be achieved if the HLB technique was used. Results for both ‘ideal’ and ‘commercial’ emulsions (refer Chapter 6) did show superior results for the EPM proposed emulsion, both in terms of initial droplet size of the emulsion as well as its longer term stability. Although the work completed in this thesis only touches the surface of a full validation of the proposed method, it does show encouraging signs and raises some interesting questions regarding emulsion formation, resulting stability and the mechanisms involved with each process. This is an area where further work is justified in the quest to remove the trial and error approach to emulsifier selection...|$|E
