40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to synthesize polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) -chitosan composite membranes for Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) by casting process and study the effect of gamma irradiation on its physico-chemical properties. The mixture of 10 % polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and 2 % chitosan solutions with different compositions of 75 / 25; 50 / 50; 25 / 75 (%,v/v) were casting at room temperature, then irradiated by gamma rays from Co- 60 with the doses 20, 30, 40 and 50 kGy. The chemical changes of membranes were characterized using Fourier Transform Infra Red (FT-IR). Water absorption and biodegradation test were determined gravimetrically. Tensile strength and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>breaks</b> were measured by using universal testing machine. It was found that with the increase irradiation dose from 10 kGy up to 50 kGy, the water absorption and degradation ofmembranes increase.

Regarding tensile properties, aromatic polyacetylenes [i. e. ring-substituted poly(phenylacetylene) s and poly(diphenylacetylene) s] showed large Young's moduli (500 – 2000 MPa) and small <b>elongations</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> (1 – 8 %), implying that these polymers are hard and brittle. In contrast, Young's moduli of Si- and S-containing aliphatic polyacetylenes were rather small (several hundred megapascal), and their <b>elongations</b> <b>at</b> <b>break</b> were relatively large (several tens per cent); i. e. they {{are soft and}} ductile. This tendency was remarkable in the polymers having long n-alkyl chains. According to dynamic viscoelastic measurements, the glass transition temperatures (Tgs) of poly(diphenylacetylene) s were > 200 °C, whereas those of poly(phenylacetylene) s were 110 – 200 °C, depending on the kinds of substitutents.
