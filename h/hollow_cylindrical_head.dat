Hollow CDRA has been used instead of single-element CDRA to achieve the above mentioned goal.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} {{parameters of}} constitutive equations for soil and rock {{can be determined}} by laboratory experiments in which a cylindrical specimen is commonly tested under uniaxial and triaxial compressive conditions. The distribution of stress in the specimen during the tests must be kept uniform and homogeneous. In this paper, numerical simulations are carried out to determine the distribution of stress in <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> specimens under a uniaxial compressive state {{and the distribution of}} stress in a rectangular parallelepiped specimen under a plane strain condition. The results of the numerical simulations reveal that if <b>cylindrical</b> and <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> specimens are tested under a uniaxial compressive condition, the stress distribution will no longer be uniform or homogeneous after the peak strength under strain-hardening and/or strain-softening conditions. This means that the post-yielding mechanical parameters of constitutive equations cannot be determined by <b>cylindrical</b> or <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> specimens. On the other hand, if a rectangular parallelepiped specimen is tested under a plane strain condition, it is found that the stress distribution in the specimen will always be uniform and homogeneous, even after the peak strength. Thus, a rectangular pararellepiped specimen, compressed under a plane strain condition, is preferable for determining the post-yielding mechanical parameters of constitutive equations. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Research on {{reducing}} material absorption in Tera-hertz (THz) waveguides has lead to development of guiding struc-tures with transmission losses {{as low as}} 1 dB/m. Among waveg-uides that exhibit low loss at THz frequencies are the dielectric-lined <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> metallic waveguides. Loss reduction in this waveguide is attributed to an ideal profile of the dominant hybrid HE mode. This mode profile also results in relatively low dis-persion and very high coupling efficiency. In this contribution we overview properties of dielectric-lined <b>hollow</b> <b>cylindrical</b> metallic waveguides for THz waves, their design principles and the fabri-cation process. The impact of the mode profile on losses and dis-persion at THz frequencies is confirmed experimentally by THz near-field imaging and THz time-domain spectroscopy and numer-ically by the finite element method.
