Every time we get the chance to work together I always try to do something a little different, you know. I hadn't seen her a do a real stripped down, really basic video. I got a taste of it when I did another video with her where she was a guest star, and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> really stripped down in that but it was still in a Jamaican environment. I just wanted to put her in a really contemporary American environment and bring out the emotions in the song and the bittersweetness of it. Me and her were just vibing off that, and thought it would be really fun to do something just really simple. No visual effects, no gags. The whole strength of the video is on just the honesty of the piece, and that was sort of what we set out to do. Sometimes it's an important visual effect, today it's an important emotion." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1986, American {{actor and}} {{accomplished}} aviator Cliff Robertson was {{contacted by the}} Hangar 21 group in Bridgeport and was asked to attempt to fly their reproduction No.21 while under tow behind a sports car, {{for the benefit of}} the press. Robertson said [...] "We did a run and nothing happened. And we did a second run and nothing happened. Then the wind came up a little and we did another run and, sure enough, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> up and flying. Then we went back and did a second one." [...] Robertson commented, [...] "We will never take away the rightful role of the Wright brothers, but if this poor little German immigrant did indeed get an airplane to go up and fly one day, then let's give him the recognition he deserves." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her in my arms and she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> to see--it {{took some}} little time--the {{disadvantages}} of this. We {{should only be}} adding to Robina's troubles; and change of plan now would unsettle Dick's mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "I chased her an' when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her,</b> seein' it wasn't Nell Rayner--why--I kept her, anyhow," [...] replied Riggs. [...] "An' I've got a {{word for}} your ear alone." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'And to {{tell you}} the truth, Gill, nothing in that way ever was so bad to me as your own mother going and marrying; and now, you see, <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>her</b> back again---and more too.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I helped them. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> things together, tied {{them up in}} my own shawl, {{and threw}} them into the {{compound}} out of a back window. I did it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly. The {{very reason}} why <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> {{to go off}} silently, as she has done, was because nothing should be said against her here, and no scandal should be heard of.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When we got upstairs Mrs. Brown {{telephones}} for {{the bill}} right away. It came, and it was $600. I saw the bill. Aunt Maggie fainted. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> on a lounge and opened the bead-work.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>her</b> {{out into}} the garden ere this. I now set her down on a seat and told her she should not stir till she had avowed which she meant in the end to accept--the man or the monkey.|$|R

30|$|My deepest {{gratitude}} goes to my advisor Seungeun Lee in Gachon University for her {{encouragement and}} guidance for my article.

6000|$|... "So help me, that's all I want! If <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> once up here again, and {{was sure}} the thing was off, {{for a month or}} so, let me alone, then, for {{bringing}} her to reason!" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{spare the}} reader the details. Suffice {{it to say}} that after much entreaty, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> to admit that she loved me, but she refused to accept me until she had told me her whole history.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> {{to throw}} herself {{precisely}} into this attitude. Little mother sat for Gessius Florus, and Mirah clasped her knees." [...] Here Hans {{went a little}} way off {{and looked at the}} effect of his touches.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ray and <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back to <b>her</b> flat this evening. Who do {{you think}} was there? The mater! She was sitting hand in hand with old Danby.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold up!" [...] {{cried the}} Giant. [...] "Hold up! {{here is one}} I forgot," [...] and he {{commenced}} feeling in his pockets.

6000|$|... "She {{must not}} be moved to-night Captain," [...] said Dr Lawrence, for whom Gillie had been sent; [...] "the place where she lies is doubtless far from {{comfortable}}, but <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>her</b> to sleep, {{and it would be}} a pity to awake her. To-morrow we shall get her into more comfortable quarters." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> back to {{the house}} and to her bed, whither she went obediently enough, and soon fell into the sleep of exhaustion. But there was no more sleep for me that night. I kept a grim vigil with dread.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} come at last," [...] Mabel said {{when he entered the}} room. [...] "No;--Miss Cassewary is not here. As I wanted to see you alone <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> to go out this morning. Why did you not come before?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blink, I swear it'll {{go through}} fine," [...] {{declared}} Pan earnestly. [...] "She knows she's your wife--that <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> drunk and forced her into it. She doesn't remember. I'm hoping she'll not remember anything, {{but even if}} she does I'll fix it." ...|$|E
60|$|CONSTABLE. 'Tempted sooicide, sir; but she hadn't been in {{the water}} 'arf a minute when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> hold of <b>her.</b> [He bends lower.] Can't {{understand}} her collapsin' like this.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say. I thought I {{would go}} and tell you. And then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> anxious about <b>her,</b> and knocked at her door, {{and looked into the}} room. Gone! Gone!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} catch the car and ran on to the grass to get a wider sweep; but she wouldn't take the curve. Went {{straight}} up the hillside for a dozen yards and then threw me off. Luckily I fell into some fern and when I'd pulled myself together, <b>I</b> somehow <b>got</b> <b>her</b> down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't they!" [...] she exclaimed, laughing. [...] "I had the dearest, naughtiest {{little girl}} this morning, and, do you know, when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> clean, her own {{brothers}} and sisters didn't know her again. I'm so glad I've seen you, Mr. Brooks. I {{want to ask you}} something." [...] "Well?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That’s what I thought," [...] {{said his}} niece, [...] "but it wasn’t, because <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> off at last and searched it through and through. I never saw {{anything}} like her clothes {{in all my}} life. There was hardly a button or a tape on; and as for her stockings—" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>her</b> {{through my}} old friend, Blandly, who [...] has proved himself {{throughout}} {{the most surprising}} [...] trump. The admirable fellow literally slaved in [...] my interest, and so, I may say, did everyone in [...] Bristol, {{as soon as they}} got wind of the port we [...] sailed for--treasure, I mean.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> on to <b>her</b> crib {{and kissed}} her: her {{forehead}} was cold, and her cheek both cold and thin, {{and so were}} her hand and wrist; but she smiled as of old.|$|R
60|$|DOOLITTLE. Tell her so, Governor: {{tell her}} so. I'm willing. It's me that suffers by it. I've no hold on <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to be {{agreeable}} to <b>her.</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to give <b>her</b> presents. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to buy <b>her</b> clothes something sinful. I'm {{a slave to}} that woman, Governor, just because I'm not her lawful husband. And she knows it too. Catch her marrying me! Take my advice, Governor: marry Eliza while she's young and don't know no better. If you don't you'll be sorry for it after. If you do, she'll be sorry for it after; but better you than her, because you're a man, and she's only a woman and don't {{know how to be}} happy anyhow.|$|R
6000|$|Ultimately I overcame all her scruples, and by {{promising}} her {{a visit to}} the great city of Minneapolis (with the privilege of returning if she didn't like the school) <b>I</b> finally <b>got</b> <b>her</b> to start with me. Poor, little scared sister, I only half realized the agony of mind through which you passed as we rode away into the Minnesota prairies! ...|$|R
