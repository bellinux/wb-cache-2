60|$|He {{received}} no applause, and he squirmed through the ropes, snakelike, {{into the arms}} of <b>his</b> <b>seconds,</b> who helped him to the floor and supported him down the aisle into the crowd. Joe remained where he had fallen. <b>His</b> <b>seconds</b> carried him into his corner and placed him on the stool. Men began climbing into the ring, curious to see, but were roughly shoved out by the policemen, who were already there.|$|R

25|$|Both Anand and Carlsen had a team {{of seconds}} to aid in their match preparation. Anand's seconds for the match were Surya Ganguly and Radosław Wojtaszek, who had helped him in four {{previous}} World Championship matches; <b>his</b> primary <b>second</b> Peter Heine Nielsen had been hired away {{earlier in the year}} by Carlsen, under agreement that he would not help Carlsen during this match against Anand. During the opening press conference, Anand revealed <b>his</b> new <b>seconds</b> to be Krishnan Sasikiran, Sandipan Chanda and Peter Leko. Carlsen at first declined to reveal <b>his</b> <b>seconds,</b> but after the match revealed that Jon Ludvig Hammer had been doing opening preparation from Norway.

Over a year after the match Carlsen also revealed that Pavel Eljanov had been among <b>his</b> <b>seconds</b> in the Chennai match.|$|R
60|$|He had {{correctly}} calculated in {{this case}} the policy of his opponent. When the Marquis was informed by <b>his</b> <b>seconds</b> that Syme could only fight in the morning, he must fully have realised that an obstacle had suddenly arisen between him and his bomb-throwing business in the capital. Naturally he could not explain this objection to his friends, so he chose the course which Syme had predicted. He induced <b>his</b> <b>seconds</b> to settle on a small meadow not far from the railway, and he trusted to the fatality of the first engagement.|$|R
60|$|Joe leaned forward, feet {{gathered}} {{under him}} for a spring, like a foot- racer waiting the start. He {{was waiting for the}} gong. When it sounded he shot forward and across the ring, catching Ponta in the midst of <b>his</b> <b>seconds</b> as he rose from his stool. And in the midst of <b>his</b> <b>seconds</b> he went down, knocked down by a right-hand blow. As he arose from the confusion of buckets, stools, and seconds, Joe put him down again. And yet a third time he went down before he could escape from his own corner.|$|R

60|$|Tom {{took the}} hand, and shook it, {{and then a}} mist came over his eyes, and his knees tottered, as, with the ringing cheers {{of the men in}} his ears, he fainted into <b>his</b> <b>second's</b> arms.|$|R
