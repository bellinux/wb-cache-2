5|$|After the {{dismissal}} of the federal lawsuit, The Daily Show's correspondent John Oliver interviewed Walter L. Wagner, who declared that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> chance of the LHC destroying the Earth to be 50%, since it will either happen or it won't.|$|E
5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate design team and his decision to mimic the strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's {{victory was}} the biggest in the Community Shield in 16 years. Wenger was pleased with his team's {{performance}} and felt the win would provide a confidence boost for the coming season. Pellegrini's reaction was indifferent; <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> absence of several first team players was linked to their poor show.|$|E
50|$|In a Wall Street Journal interview, Bast {{said that}} <b>he</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> climate has warmed {{in the second}} half of the 20th Century and there is likely a {{measurable}} human impact on climate. <b>He</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> human impact on global warming is likely very small and that minimal warming is not a crisis.|$|R
50|$|Gerschenkron also {{warns of}} the {{possible}} difficulties of creating a government monopoly. <b>He</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> management of the monopoly would require “great practical skill and energy”. <b>He</b> <b>believes</b> <b>the</b> Germans should include this program of the agricultural adjustment plan in the peace treaties and entrust its execution and supervision to an international economic agency.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1971 Bernie Ecclestone bought MRD. He {{retained}} the Brabham brand, as did subsequent owners. Although the production of customer cars continued briefly under Ecclestone's ownership, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> company needed to focus on Formula One to succeed. The last production customer Brabhams were the Formula Two BT40 and the Formula Three BT41 of 1973, although Ecclestone sold ex-works Formula One BT44Bs to RAM Racing as late as 1976.|$|E
5|$|Earlier, {{the first}} {{recorded}} use {{of toilet paper}} was made in 589 by the scholar-official Yan Zhitui (531–591), and in 851 an Arab Muslim traveler commented on how <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> Tang era Chinese were not careful about cleanliness {{because they did not}} wash with water (as was his people's habit) when going to the bathroom; instead, he said, the Chinese simply used paper to wipe themselves.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} {{months of the}} war, Hand {{increasingly}} supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> United States should endorse the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at The New Republic, who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.|$|E

5|$|Jarvis {{ended the}} season having been {{named in the}} PFA's League One Team of the Year, and with Charlton Athletic expressing their {{interest}} in him. However, Gillingham chairman Paul Scally stated that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> player's agent had already agreed a transfer with another club. Scally also claimed that Jarvis {{had the potential to}} play for England {{by the time he was}} 24.|$|E
5|$|Kickers {{experience}} further disadvantages when attempting {{field goals}} at CenturyLink Field. Both the stadium's proximity to Puget Sound {{and the open}} north end create winds that are challenging to gauge. Former Seahawks kicker Josh Brown adjusted to the winds, and <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> moisture in the air caused trouble for others.|$|E
5|$|Mya's visual representation, however, {{appeared}} solely during {{advertising and}} on her website. Only her voice was to be heard when using the actual program. Demonstrations of Mya's abilities and images of the character could be viewed at the now defunct website, mya.com. Raimondi said <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> name Mya was a play on the words 'My assistant', as did Sidney Matrix in the book Cyberpop: Digital Lifestyles and Commodity Culture.|$|E

5|$|On 16 August 2011, the Irish Examiner {{reported}} that Micheál Martin {{had moved to}} pull the party out of the presidential race over {{the fallout from the}} approach to Gay Byrne, the cost involved and the slim chance of a candidate being elected. On 24 August, however, the party's deputy leader Éamon Ó Cuív told Raidió na Gaeltachta that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> party should put forward a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Parry resumed the clubs' {{meeting and}} {{recommended}} BSkyB's offer to the chairmen. <b>He</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> company was a frontrunner in encryption services and was pleased they offered a 50–50 {{partnership with the}} Premier League to exploit PPV. BSkyB's alliance with the BBC also convinced Parry; when he informed Dyke of this, the ITV chairman threatened to do a deal directly with the clubs which angered him.|$|E
5|$|A police {{investigation}} {{did not find}} a motive behind the shooting, although Gale's mother said that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia and that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> brothers had stolen his lyrics while trying to steal his identity. She {{did not know if}} her son took the medication he was given for his condition, but was proud of his military service following his discharge, and had given him the Beretta 92F that was used in the shooting. Major Jason Johnston, a Marine Corps spokesman at The Pentagon, was unable to comment on Gale's discharge.|$|E

5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine {{was brought in}} to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E
5|$|After {{more than}} a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth {{returned}} as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life of Agony and Coal Chamber. In July, the band participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> drummer had lied about having cancer.|$|E
5|$|Although Stanford had fared poorly {{during the}} {{previous}} seasons, Thornhill had left behind a team with a talented roster, which included 24returning lettermen. Shaughnessy believed the players were good, but unsuited to the single-wing offense that his predecessor had employed. Perhaps most importantly, Shaughnessy inherited back Frankie Albert, whom he considered a prototypical T formation quarterback. In 1943, Shaughnessy wrote that he considered the 1940 Stanford backfield—quarterback Frankie Albert, fullback Norm Standlee, right halfback Hugh Gallarneau, and left halfback Pete Kmetovic—as the greatest in history. While <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> Indians backfield was better than any such combination in the single-wing, double-wing, short punt, or box formations, he added the caveat that this held true only in the Stanford players' employment in the T-formation.|$|E

5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> {{accounts}} {{referred to a}} species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E
5|$|Brown and the Labour {{party had}} pledged {{to allow a}} {{referendum}} on the EU Treaty of Lisbon. On 13 December 2007, Foreign Secretary David Miliband attended for the Prime Minister at the official signing ceremony in Lisbon of the EU Reform Treaty. Brown's opponents {{on both sides of the}} House, and in the press, suggested that ratification by Parliament was not enough and that a referendum should also be held. Labour's 2005 manifesto had pledged to give British public {{a referendum on the}} original EU Constitution. Brown argued that the Treaty significantly differed from the Constitution, and as such did not require a referendum. He also responded with plans for a lengthy debate on the topic, and stated that <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> document to be too complex to be decided by referendum.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{considered}} Ankylosaurus so distinct {{that he made}} it {{the type}} genus of a new family, Ankylosauridae (members of which are called ankylosaurids), typified by massive, triangular skulls, short necks, stiff backs, broad bodies, and osteoderms. He also classified Palaeoscincus (only known from teeth), and Euoplocephalus (then only known from a partial skull and osteoderms) {{as part of the}} family. Due to the fragmentary remains, Brown was unable to fully distinguish between Euoplocephalus and Ankylosaurus. Only having few, incomplete members of the family to compare with, <b>he</b> <b>believed</b> <b>the</b> group was part of the suborder Stegosauria. In 1923, Osborn coined the name Ankylosauria (members of which are called ankylosaurs or ankylosaurians), thereby placing the ankylosaurids in their own suborder.|$|E
