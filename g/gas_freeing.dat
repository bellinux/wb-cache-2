50|$|It {{was in the}} early-1970s {{that the}} first Inert Gas Systems were {{developed}} to improve safety on board tankers. During the previous docking at AFO Shipyard in Brest, France, a few weeks before, Golar Patricia had been retrofitted with such an installation. However, the normal docking time had not been enough to complete 100% of the works related to the crude oil tanks. This completion was done at sea, the ship being kept gas free during her ballast passage to Persian Gulf. No works had been done during the loaded passage back to Europe, and the commissioning of the new IG System was to be done after completion of the <b>gas</b> <b>freeing</b> operation during which the explosion occurred.|$|E
5000|$|Inert gas is {{produced}} on board crude oil carriers (above 8,000 tonnes)(from Jan 1, 2016) by using either a flue gas system or by burning kerosene in a dedicated inert gas generator. The inert gas system {{is used to}} prevent the atmosphere in cargo tanks or bunkers from coming into the explosive range. IG keeps the oxygen content of the tank atmosphere below 5% (on crude carriers, less for product carriers and gas tankers), thus making any air/hydrocarbon gas mixture in the tank too rich (too high a fuel to oxygen ratio) to ignite. IG is most important during discharging and during the ballast voyage when more hydrocarbon vapour {{is likely to be}} present in the tank atmosphere. Inert gas {{can also be used to}} purge the tank of the volatile atmosphere in preparation for <b>gas</b> <b>freeing</b> - replacing the atmosphere with breathable air - or vice versa.|$|E

This highly complex project marked {{the year as}} one of the most important ship repair projects. It occupied a large part of the shipyard resources most of 2015. The works commenced in January 2015 and were completed in August 2015. They included complete overhaul and docking of the ship, class surveys, renovation of accommodations and galleys, shell plating and deck house steel renewal. Especially interesting was the modification of the existing vessel’s electrical power supply system and the installation of new generators, switch boards and control mechanisms, and refurbishment of the fuel system, reverse osmosis system, black and gray discharge water system, fire alarm and similar. UHP water blasting of hull, Ballast tanks blasting with steel shots and application of full coating system, cleaning and <b>gas</b> <b>freeing</b> of all fuel tanks, modification of existing spaces into the new auxiliary engine room including installation of 3 new CAT generators, switch boards and control room was carried out.

40|$|Many mud diapirs {{have been}} {{identified}} in the southern Okinawa Trough from a seismic survey using R/V KEXUE I in 2001. The movement and accumulation of <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> related to mud diapirs are discussed in detail by an analysis of fluid potential which is based upon velocity data. It can be found that <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> moves from the higher fluid potential strata to the lower ones and the gas hydrate comes into being during <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> movement meeting the proper criteria of temperature and pressure. In fact, gas hydrates have been found in the upper layers above the mud diapirs and in host rocks exhibiting other geophysical characteristics. As the result of the formation of the <b>gas</b> hydrate, the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> bearing strata are enclosed by the gas hydrate bearing strata. Due to the high pressure anomalies of the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> bearing strata the fluid potential increases noticeably. It can then be concluded that the high fluid potential anomaly on the low fluid potential background may be caused by the presence of the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> below the gas hydrate bearing strata...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an in-depth {{study of the}} <b>gas</b> <b>freeing</b> of marine crude oil tanks using numerical simulation, beginning with a general summary of the problem, followed by an outline of the objectives of this work and the main difficulties involved. To outline essential background, a review of numerical methods, fluid flow, and related physical mechanisms has been undertaken, in addition to related ventilation fields, jet and jet impingement, and tanker-borne ventilation, {{in order to determine}} the state of the art and draw useful parallels between different ventilative fields, as well as identifying potential areas for model validation. A room-ventilation test case was studied in order to demonstrate the numerical method. It was found that assuming adiabatic walls and ignoring radiation resulted in highly idealised temperature predictions, and that radiation played a large part in enhancing vertical temperature prediction by redistributing thermal energy. For the gas-freeing analysis, the geometric models and solution procedures are introduced before simulation results presented and validated with analytical jet models and impingement penetration parameters. Analysis showed that the internal temperature of the tank was approximately homogeneous, allowing the tank to be considered isothermal. 2 D simulations showed that after an initial period of time, the relative concentration distribution reaches steady state with decreasing average concentration as gas-freeing continues. Discussion of the results followed, examining aspects surrounding heat transfer and the choice of turbulence model, analysing the differences in the results between the first and secondmoment closure schemes and justification of assuming isothermal conditions. The variation in concentration was examined, and an analytical expression was derived which approximates the reduction in average gas concentration decay due to gas-freeing. It has been shown that double-hulled construction renders the internal temperature variation to around 10 % of the temperature difference between the sea and deck. During the gasfreeing process proper, it was shown that after any stratified layer has been eroded and a stable flow field established, the relative concentration distribution remains constant. <b>Gas</b> <b>freeing</b> times were shown to be heavily dependent on the volume flux (and thus air change rate), and mathematical relations derived in order to provide approximately predict the time to gas free a crude oil tank (COT) given particular initial conditions...|$|E

This model is compared to the reduced model introduced in BMTZ-fvca 7 using a 1 D approximation of the <b>gas</b> <b>free</b> flow. For that purpose, the gas molar fraction diffusive flux at the interface in the free-flow domain is approximated by a two point flux approximation based on a low frequency diagonal approximation of a Steklov-Poincaré type operator.

40|$|This master thesis study uses seismic {{modeling}} {{to better}} understand the seismic response of the <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> that accumulates beneath hydrate-bearing sediments. To this end, I developed 12 different geological models ranging from very simple geometries to anticline structures. Within these models, I varied the distribution of <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> in the layers beneath the BSR. Sediment properties were taken from velocity profiles of the Storegga gas hydrate system and the density approximately estimated from a computed Gassmann diagram. Norsar 2 D, Norsar 3 D and Seisrox modeling programs were used to generate PSDM seismic images. Higher frequencies, large incident angle and long horizontal sampling distances has resulted in the generation of BSR as termination of enhanced reflection. The termination of the enhanced reflections coincided with anticlinal and dipping BSR in this study. The presence of intercalation of <b>gas</b> <b>free</b> and hydrate bearing layers above the dipping BSR and <b>gas</b> <b>free</b> and <b>gas</b> bearing sediments below the dipping BSR led to the termination of enhanced reflection at the BGHSZ. Low frequency, near angle and small sampling distances resulted in proper BSR reflections for the geologic setting mentioned above. Lower frequency and large sampling distances results in termination of enhanced reflection of the BSR. A seismic section from Hydratech data was compared to the synthetic seismic model...|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{numerical}} {{models for}} simulating <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> accumulation in marine sediments have been developed. These models include several physical {{processes such as}} phase equilibrium of gas hydrates, multiphase fluid flow in porous media, biogenic methane production, and sedimentation-compaction of sediments over geologic timescales. Non-dimensionalization of the models lead {{to the emergence of}} important dimensionless groups controlling these dynamic systems, such as the Peclet number, Damkohler number, and a sedimentation-compaction group that compares permeability to sedimentation rate. Exploring the entire parameter space of these dimensionless groups helps in delineating different modes of <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> occurrence, e. g., no hydrate and hydrate with or without underlying <b>free</b> <b>gas.</b> Scaling schemes developed for these systems help in summarizing average gas hydrate saturation for hundreds of simulation results into two simple contour plots. The utility of these contour plots in predicting average hydrate saturation is shown through application to different geologic settings. The depth to the sulfate-methane transition (SMT) is also developed as an independent proxy for gas hydrate saturation for deep-source systems. It is shown through numerical modeling that scaled depth to the SMT correlates with the average gas hydrate flux through the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ). Later, analytical theory is developed for calculating steady-state concentration profiles as well as the complete gas hydrate saturation profile from the SMT depth. Application of this theory to several sites along Cascadia Margin indicates that SMT depth {{can be used as a}} fast and inexpensive proxy to get a first-order estimate of gas hydrate saturation, compared to expensive deep-drilling methods. The effect of overpressure development in low permeability gas hydrate systems is shown to have an important effect on <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturations. Specifically, overpressure development decreases the net amount of <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> in the system, in addition to extending the base of the hydrate stability zone below the seafloor by a relatively small depth. We also study the role of upward <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> migration in producing long, connected <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> columns beneath the gas hydrate layer. Finally, two-dimensional models are developed to study the effect of heterogeneities on <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> distribution. Simulation results show that hydrate as well as <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> accumulates in relatively high saturations within these high permeability sediments, such as faults/fracture networks, dipping sand layers, and combinations of both, due to focused fluid flow...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the GHASS (Gas Hydrates, fluid Activities and Sediment deformations in the western Black Sea) cruise are twofold but interconnected. The first aim is to study the dynamics of <b>gas</b> hydrates and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> associated with geological and climate processes. The second aim is to identify the factors at the origin of observed sediment deformations and submarine landslides in two areas in the Romanian sector of the Black Sea. For the cruise we use quantitative approaches based on multidisciplinary studies (geochemistry, geology, geophysics and geotechnics). Gas hydrates and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> were detected using surface and deep-towed HR seismic (SYSIF) techniques and by performing in situ geotechnical and acoustic measurements using the Ifremer penetrometer (Penfeld). Dynamics of <b>gas</b> hydrate and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> were evaluated based on geochemical analysis of pore fluids but also by carrying out in situ geotechnical measurements and long-term monitoring (several years) of few key sites with pore pressure and temperature measurements. The deformation and submarine landslides associated with <b>gas</b> hydrates, <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> and/or the Danube canyon activities were also studied by using advanced geotechnical technologies and detailed sedimentological studies on sediment cores.

40|$|Bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) were {{observed}} beneath the seafloor {{in the northern}} continental margin of the South China Sea (SCS). Acoustic impedance profile was derived by Constrained Sparse Spike Inversion (CSSI) method to provide information on rock properties and to estimate <b>gas</b> hydrate or <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturations in the sediments where BSRs are present. In general, gas hydrate-bearing sediments have positive impedance anomalies and free gas-bearing sediments have negative impedance anomalies. Based on well log data and Archie's equation, gas hydrate saturation can be estimated. But in regions where well log data is not available, a quantitative estimate of <b>gas</b> hydrate or <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturation is inferred by fitting the theoretical acoustic impedance to sediment impedance obtained by CSSI. Our study suggests that gas hydrate saturation in the Taixinan Basin is about 10 - 20 % of the pore space, with the highest value of 50 %, and <b>free</b> <b>gas</b> saturation below BSR is about 2 - 3 % of the pore space, that can rise to 8 - 10 % at a topographic high.

Our study results indicate that the mean free path of all molecules in nanopores depend on both the radius of the nanopore and the gas-solid interaction strength. Besides mean free path of all molecules in the nanopore, this paper highlights the <b>gas</b> molecular mean <b>free</b> path at different positions of the nanopore and the anisotropy of the <b>gas</b> molecular mean <b>free</b> path at nanopores. The molecular mean free path varies with the molecule’s distance {{from the center of the}} nanopore. The least value of the mean free path occurs at the wall surface of the nanopore.
