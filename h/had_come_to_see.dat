5|$|By 2003, many Turks <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> American {{foreign policy}} in the region as a threat. Matters were not helped by the {{election}} in 2002 of the Justice and Development Party (AKP). The election of the AKP led to an immediate increase in tensions with America, especially after the Parliament's decision not to send any Turkish troops to Iraq further eroded US-Turkish relations. 70% of the parliament members were Justice and Development Party members.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} {{wary of the}} FROLINAT, Gaddafi <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> by 1970 {{the organization}} as useful to his needs. With the support of Soviet bloc nations, particularly East Germany, he trained and armed the insurgents, and provided them with weapons and funding. On 27 August 1971 Chad accused Egypt and Libya of backing a coup against then-president François Tombalbaye by recently amnestied Chadians.|$|E

5|$|A {{love affair}} between Thamarai (Kushboo) and her {{maternal}} uncle Nellaiyankondan (Jayaram) is badly received by their family, {{especially since he}} is not financially well off. Thamarai's father, King Periyamalaikozhundhu Gounder (Vijayakumar), arranges for her marriage to Mandhiyappan (Prakash Raj), ruler of a neighbouring country. Thamarai rejects the arranged marriage, angering Mandhiyappan. She later marries her lover, who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her marry Mandhiyappan, and challenges her brother Chinna Malaikozhundhu (Ponvannan) to marry his daughters off to her sons (the marriage of cousins is a gounder custom). Periyamalaikozhundhu disowns his daughter for choosing Nellaiyankondan and banishes them from his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|At {{the climax}} of the event, a crate filled with disco records was blown up on the field between games of the twi-night doubleheader between the Chicago White Sox and the Detroit Tigers. Many of those in {{attendance}} <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was damaged both by the explosion and by the rowdy fans {{to the point where the}} White Sox were required to forfeit the second game of the doubleheader to the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|In 1646, when Qing armies led by Bolo {{had entered}} the city of Fuzhou, they had found envoys from the Ryūkyū Kingdom, Annam, and the Spanish in Manila. These {{tributary}} embassies that <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the now fallen Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming were forwarded to Beijing, and eventually sent home with instructions about submitting to the Qing. The King of the Ryūkyū Islands sent his first tribute mission to the Qing in 1649, Siam in 1652, and Annam in 1661, after the last remnants of Ming resistance {{had been removed from}} Yunnan, which bordered Annam.|$|E

5|$|Chnodomar {{could not}} ignore Julian's {{fortification}} of Saverne, as it threatened his control of Alsace and blocked his main access route {{into the interior}} of Gaul. He <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this region as Alamanni territory by right of conquest after occupying it for several years. He also claimed to possess letters from Constantius granting the Alamanni the right to occupy those lands. Chnodomar had been surprised and dismayed by Julian's successful campaigns of 355-7. But he was encouraged by his own success against Barbatio and the intelligence brought to him by a deserter that Barbatio's withdrawal had left the Caesar with only 13,000 men. Having driven two Roman magistri from the field (Barbatio and before him, Magnentius' lieutenant, Decentius), Chnodomar had lost the barbarians' traditional fear of pitched battles with the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The Giants went 8–4–1 in 1926, and {{withstood}} {{a challenge}} from an upstart American football league {{led by a}} team featuring Grange. Grange and his agent had formed the American Football League and placed their flagship team, the Yankees, in New York. According to a story by The New York Times published at the time, the Giants lost over $50,000 during the season. Grange's league lasted one season however, and was subsumed into the NFL. The Giants were so desperate to make money they allowed star Duluth Eskimos running back Ernie Nevers back into a close game after he was injured, even though by the rules they {{had the right to}} disallow his re-entrance, to please fans who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. The Yankees were subsumed into the NFL the next year and played most of their games on the road to avoid direct competition with the Giants. They folded in 1928, one year after Grange went back to playing for the Bears. The Giants paid a total of $21,000 in player salary in 1926, including paying all player expenses during the season, and player salaries ranged from $1,500 to $3,000. According to March, the attendance for the season was nearly equal to the 274,500 the team reported in their inaugural season. However, home attendance for games at the Polo Grounds dropped from 25,000 to 15,000 a game. The team's attendance on the road was significantly higher in their early history—the team averaged 57,000 in their three road games in 1925.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the initial}} unrest, the 1950s were {{something}} of a golden age for the nearly 40,000 remaining Italian expatriates in Italian Somaliland. With United Nations funds pouring in and experienced Italian administrators who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the territory as their home, infrastructural and educational development blossomed. Relations between the Italian settlers and the Somalis were also generally good. This decade passed relatively without incident and was marked by positive growth in many sectors of local life.|$|E
25|$|Classically, the {{bringing}} of unconscious {{thoughts and}} feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in which patients report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so. Another important element of psychoanalysis is transference, {{the process by which}} patients displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it as {{an essential part of the}} therapeutic process.|$|E
25|$|After {{injuring}} {{herself in}} the quarterfinal match against Dementieva, Venus Williams defaulted to Serena in the semifinals. Although Venus told the tournament official hours beforehand {{that she would have}} to default, the official word was not given until 10 minutes before the scheduled start (in the hopes that Venus would change her mind), angering fans who <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the match. Consequently, during the final against Kim Clijsters two days later, the spectators jeered Serena from when she first took the court for warm-up through the final trophy presentation including cheering double faults and errors with no intervention from the tournament officials. Despite these attacks, Serena went on to win the tournament.|$|E

Paul, whom Caro interviewed shortly before the former's death, claimed Robert had exerted undue influence on their mother to change her will in Robert's favor shortly before her death. Caro notes that Paul was on bad terms with their mother over a long period and she may have changed the will of her own accord, and implies that Robert's subsequent treatment of Paul may have been legally justifiable but was morally questionable.|$|E
25|$|Playing in a {{match at}} College Park (Trinity College) in Dublin for Dublin University against a London County XI in 1903 Harvey caught and bowled (for a duck!) W.G.Grace. Another future Bishop, Jack Crozier, {{performed}} a cartwheel as Grace walked reluctantly to the pavilion. Grace allegedly {{complained to the}} umpire that the crowd <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him bat and not to watch Harvey bowl. With the previous ball, Harvey had dismissed W.L. Murdoch, one time captain of Australia. Interestingly Harvey faced the three fastest bowlers in the world playing for Dublin University against Australia, Leicestershire & South Africa; they were Cotter, Kortright and Cootzee. He held that Cotter was a bodyline bowler long before Larwood came on the scene.|$|E
25|$|Belgian {{military}} planning assumed {{that if there}} was a German invasion the other powers guaranteeing Belgian neutrality would eject the invaders. This did not lead to the Belgian state seeing France and Britain as allies and Belgium intended only to protect its independence. The Anglo-French Entente (1904), had led the Belgians to believe that the British <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Belgium as a British protectorate. A Belgian General Staff was formed in 1910 but the , Lieutenant-Général Harry Jungbluth was retired on 30 June 1912 and not replaced until May 1914, by Lieutenant-General Chevalier de Selliers de Moranville. The new Chief of Staff began planning for the concentration of the army and met with railway officials on 29 July to mass Belgian troops in the centre of the country.|$|E
