40|$|Wolbachia is an alpha-proteobacterial {{symbiont}} {{widely distributed}} in arthropods. Since {{the identification of}} Wolbachia in certain animal-parasitic nematodes (the Onchocercidae or <b>filariae),</b> the relationship between arthropod and nematode Wolbachia has attracted great interest. The obligate symbiosis in <b>filariae,</b> which renders infected species susceptible to antibiotic chemotherapy, was held to be distinct from the Wolbachia-arthropod relationship, typified by reproductive parasitism. While co-evolutionary signatures in Wolbachia-arthropod symbioses are generally weak, reflecting horizontal transmission events, strict co-evolution between <b>filariae</b> and Wolbachia has been reported previously. However, the absence of close outgroups for phylogenetic studies prevented the determination of which host group originally acquired Wolbachia. Here, we present the largest co-phylogenetic analysis of Wolbachia in <b>filariae</b> performed to date including: (i) a screening and an updated phylogeny of Wolbachia; (ii) a co-phylogenetic analysis; and (iii) a hypothesis on the acquisition of Wolbachia infection.

The accuracy of supergroup J is also underlined. Second, although a global pattern of coevolution remains, the signal is derived predominantly from filarial clades associated with Wolbachia in supergroups C and J. In other filarial clades, harbouring Wolbachia supergroups D and F, horizontal acquisitions and secondary losses are common.

40|$|The filarial worm, Litomosoides carinii, has a {{high rate}} of aerobic and {{anaerobic}} glucose metabolism. Aerobically 30 to 45 per cent of the glucose utilized was converted to lactic acid, 25 to 35 per cent to acetic acid, and 10 to 20 per cent to a polysaccharide. Anaerobically over 80 per cent of the total carbohydrate removed by the <b>filariae</b> was metabolized to lactic acid, the remainder was accounted for by the production of acetic acid. The high rates of aerobic and anaerobic lactic acid production and of aerobic polysaccharide synthesis, as well as the absence of a postanaerobic increase of the oxygen uptake, differentiate the filarial worm, L. carinii, from the known metabolic characteristics of all other helminths and of most other invertebrates. The rate of aerobic lactate and pyruvate utilization by the <b>filariae</b> appears to be much slower than that of glucose. Anaerobically, dismutation of two moles of pyruvate to one mole of lactate, one mole of acetate, and one mole of CO 2, occurred. Aerobically, acetate production from pyruvate exceeded that of lactate. A significant proportion of the pyruvate metabolized aerobically by the <b>filariae</b> was not oxidized to acetate. In the presence of fluoroacetate, aerobic incubation of the <b>filariae</b> in a glucose-containing medium produced a marked decrease in the respiration of the organisms, an accumulation of pyruvate, a decreased formation of acetate, and an increase in aerobic glycolysis. Low concentrations of fluoroacetate (1 x 10 – 3 M) inhibited the oxidative metabolism of pyruvate which did not result in the conversion of pyruvate to acetate; higher concentrations of this inhibitor produced also a decreased oxidation of pyruvate to acetate. No evidence has been obtained that fluoroacetate inhibits the respiration of the <b>filariae</b> because of a competitive inhibition of acetate oxidation. Respiration and glycolysis of <b>filariae</b> were markedly decreased by low concentrations of p-chloromercuric benzoate. This inhibition could not be reversed by a large excess of thioglycollate, cystein, glutathione, or H 2 S. Respiration of the <b>filariae</b> was completely inhibited by cyanide (2 x 10 – 4 M). The cyanine dyes, a group of compounds possessing high chemotherapeutic activity in filariasis of the cotton rat, inhibited in low concentrations (6. 5 x 10 – 8 M) the oxygen uptake of the filarial worms. This decrease in oxidative metabolism was associated with a compensatory increase in aerobic glycolysis of the worms and with decreased rates of acetate production and of polysaccharide synthesis. The same metabolic changes were observed in <b>filariae</b> removed from cotton rats to which subcurative doses of a cyanine dye had been administered. Concentrations of cyanine dyes which produced an almost complete inhibition of filarial respiration had no effect on the rate of anaerobic glycolysis of the worms nor on the activity of cytochrome C or of cytochrome oxidase. It is concluded that, in contrast to many other parasitic invertebrates, oxidative metabolism is essential for the survival of the filarial worm, L. carinii, and that the chemotherapeutic activity of the cyanine dyes in filariasis of the cotton rat is due to the inhibitory effect of this group of compounds on the respiratory metabolism of the parasite...|$|R

These results suggested that an intact thromboxane and lipoxygenase pathway within the arachidonic acid system is necessary to minimize the effect of dead D. immitis in this pulmonary artery model...|$|R
40|$|Background: The filarial parasites Loa loa and Mansonnella perstans are endemic in {{the central}} and western African forest block. Loa loa is {{pathogenic}} and represents a major obstacle to the control of co-endemic <b>filariae</b> because its treatment can cause fatal complications such as encephalitis. Methodology/Principal Findings: 4392 individuals aged over 15 years were studied both by direct examination and a concentration technique. The overall prevalence rates were 22. 4 % for Loa loa microfilaremia, 10. 2 % for M. perstans microfilaremia, and 3. 2 % for mixed infection. The prevalence of both <b>filariae</b> was higher in the forest ecosystem than in savannah and lakeland (p 8000 mf/ml (r = 0. 624; p 30 000 mf/ml (r = 0. 319, p = 0. 002). In contrast, the prevalence of pruritis and Calabar swellings correlated negatively with the prevalence of Loa loa microfilaria (r = - 0. 219, p = 0. 032; r = - 0. 220; p = 0. 031, respectively). Pruritis, Calabar swellings and eye worm were not associated with L. loa mf intensity (r = - 0. 144, p = 0. 162; r- 0. 061, p = 0. 558; and r = 0. 051, p = 0. 624, respectively), or with the prevalence or intensity of M. perstans microfilariae. Conclusions/Significance: This map {{of the distribution of}} <b>filariae</b> in Gabon should prove helpful for control programs. Our findings confirm the spatial uniformity of the relationship between parasitological indices. Clinical manifestations point to a relationship between <b>filariae</b> and allergy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This is {{the first}} study of the lesions {{produced}} by Elaeophora elaphi, a filarial worm first reported in 1986. Only the morphologic characteristics of this species have been described previously. Samples for the study were taken from 74 red deer (Cervus elaphus), 1 - 10 years old, slaughtered in central Spain. Grossly, <b>filariae</b> were observed in the transverse, left, or right branches of the portal vein of 18 animals. In addition to <b>filariae,</b> whitish thrombi {{were found in the}} right and left branches of the portal vein in nine animals. Thrombi of similar characteristics were also observed in 12 deer in which no adult <b>filariae</b> were found. Microscopic changes were observed only in the right and left branches of the portal vein and consisted of thickening of the intima with surface formation of villi. Stroma of villi contained a moderate to intense infiltrate composed mainly of eosinophils and mononuclear cells. The tunica media of affected vessels was uniformly hypertrophic and in some cases presented a moderate inflammatory infiltrate similar to that observed in the stroma of villi. Thrombi consisted of a central area containing calcified <b>filariae</b> or cuticle debris, surrounded by giant cells and numerous lymphoid cells forming clearly defined nodules resembling lymphoid follicles. Thrombi were externally sur-rounded by a strip of connective tissue and beyond by endothelial cells that were occasionally continuous with the tunica intima. Other lesions probably associated with the infestation were multifocal granulomas in the periportal areas, lymphoid tissue formations in the hepatic parenchyma, and an interstitial nephritis...|$|R

However, the two drugs used at high concentrations deeply altered the uterine embryogenesis, but had no lethal effect on adult <b>filariae.</b> #L. sigmodontis$ blood microfilariae showed a great susceptibility to moxidectin, similar to that previously described for ivermectin.

40|$|AbstractFilariae {{are common}} parasites of dogs {{in many parts}} of the world, but little is known about the status of these infections in sub-Saharan Africa. A study was carried out to {{determine}} the occurrence and species of <b>filariae</b> among 272 dogs in Lusaka, Zambia.

Ten (4. 0 %) of the examined dogs were positive for Dirofilaria immitis circulating antigen (by DiroCHEK® test), but D. immitis microfilariae were not identified in any of the dogs and the status of this infection remains unclear.

40|$|Flunixin {{meglumine}} {{was used}} to examine the effect of prostaglandin inhibition on the pathogenesis of Dirofilaria immitis in the pulmonary arteries of dogs. Immunopathological reactions to dead <b>filariae</b> were monitored by light and transmission electron microscopy and serology. Lung lesions in prostaglandin-inhibited dogs exposed to dead <b>filariae</b> were enhanced compared to control dogs. This was associated with the persistence of parasitic antigen in lung tissue and in the blood. Serology demonstrated that after insertion of D. immitis in treated dogs, antibody levels did not change, while immune complex and antigen levels increased. These results indicate that prostaglandin may have a protective effect on the way the lung reacts to dead D. immitis, and that altered dynamics of the antigen processing may well contribute to the associated lung lesions...|$|R
