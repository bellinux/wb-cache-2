5000|$|Cellulases, hemicellulases and pectinases are {{different}} exoenzymes {{that are involved}} {{in a wide variety of}} biotechnological and industrial applications. In the food industry these exoenzymes are used in the production of fruit juices, <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars,</b> fruit purees and in the extraction of olive oil among many others. [...] The role these enzymes play in these food applications is to partially breakdown the plant cell walls and pectin. In addition to the role they play in food production, cellulases are used in the textile industry to remove excess dye from denim, soften cotton fabrics and restore the color brightness of cotton fabrics. [...] Cellulases and hemicellulases (including xylanases) are also used in the paper and pulp industry to de-ink recycled fibers, modify coarse mechanical pulp and for the partial or complete hydrolysis of pulp fibers. [...] Cellulases and hemicellulases are used in these industrial applications due to their ability to hydrolyze the cellulose and hemicellulose components found in these materials.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the quality of <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> and wines available on the local market is in accordance with the quality prescribed by the Rulebook. The research involves analysis of blueberry, strawberry, peach, apple and orange <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> from two companies (C 1 and C 2), and samples of red wines from three wineries (W 1 - 3). The following quality parameters were determined: soluble solids content (% Brix), actual acidity (pH) and titratable acidity in the nectars, and actual acidity (pH) and titratable acidity in the wines. All samples of <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> met the prescribed % Brix requirements.

40|$|Abstract Juices and <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> are an {{important}} segment of the beverage market in Brazil. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze and characterize the profile of consumers of ready-to-drink juices and <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars.</b> A semi-structured questionnaire was applied to 389 patrons, intentionally and conveniently, when they approached the shelves. The chi-square test was applied to associate sociodemographic variables and consumption profile of the beverages with the type of establishment. Logistic regression models were developed to evaluate the variables associated with nectar acquisition. The level of education and knowledge about the beverages were significantly related. Practicality was the main reason that led respondents to consume these drinks, followed by quality and price, with the latter being associated with the level of education. Nectar was the most purchased option, and this choice was associated with increasing age and education, price and practicality. The consumption of juices and nectars with no added sugar was lower compared with traditional beverages. The information in the labels of these beverages was not sufficiently clear, for most of the participants. The most mentioned brand by the interviewed was the one with better sensory preference, regardless of flavour and the blinded or informed analysis...|$|E

40|$|Wickerhamomyces anomalus is pectinolytic yeast {{isolated}} from citrus fruits peels {{in the province}} of Misiones, Argentine. In the present work, enzymes produced by this yeast strain were characterized, and polygalacturonase physicochemical properties were determined in order to evaluate the application of the supernatant in the maceration of potato tissues. W. anomalus was able to produce PG in liquid medium containing glucose and citrus pectin, whose mode of action was mainly of endo type. The supernatant did not exhibit esterase or lyase activity. No others enzymes, capable of hydrolyzing cell wall polymers, such as cellulases and xylanases, were detected. PG showed maximal activity at pH 4. 5 and at temperature range between 40 °C and 50 °C. It was stable in the pH range from 3. 0 to 6. 0 and up to 50 °C at optimum pH. The enzymatic extract macerated potato tissues efficiently. Volume of single cells increased with the agitation speed.

40|$|A rapid LC-MS method, which compares {{different}} mass analyzers-single quadrupole, ion trap, {{and triple}} quadrupole-was {{developed for the}} quantitative determination of isopropyl thioxanthone (ITX) in fruit juices. ITX, a photoinitiator in UV-cured inks that can reach foods from the cartons for beverages {{in which they are}} used, was extracted from fruit juice samples with acetone/hexane (50 : 50) using pressurized liquid extraction. This method gave detection limits of 3, 3, and 0. 01 microg/L and quantification limits of 10, 10, and 0. 05 microg/L using single quadrupole, ion trap, and triple quadrupole, respectively. Five replicate fortifications of different fruit juices at the quantification limit gave recoveries oscillating between 68 and 72 % with CV varying between 14 and 18 %. This is the first report of a positive mass spectrometric identification and quantification of ITX in fruit juice samples packed in TetraPack. The sensitivity and specificity of the LC-MS/MS analysis using the triple quadrupole enables it to be the method of choice for risk assessment and monitoring. The method was applied to apricot, orange, peach, apple, grape and pineapple, and cherry and strawberry juices and to <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> from Spain and Italy, and the ITX was detected in the range of 0. 05 - 0. 78 microg/...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the main}} organic acids (citric, malic and ascorbic acids) and sugars (glucose, {{fructose}} and sucrose) present in commercial fruit beverages (fruit carbonated soft-drinks, <b>fruit</b> <b>nectars</b> and fruit juices) were determined. A novel size exclusion high performance liquid chromatography isocratic green method, with ultraviolet and refractive index detectors coupled in series, was developed. This methodology enabled the simultaneous quantification of sugars and organic acids without any sample pre-treatment, even when peak interferences occurred. The method was in-house validated, showing a good linearity (R > 0. 999), adequate detection and quantification limits (20 and 280 mg L− 1, respectively), satisfactory instrumental and method precisions (relative standard deviations lower than 6 %) and acceptable method accuracy (relative error lower than 5 %). Sugars and organic acids profiles {{were used to}} calculate dose-over-threshold values, aiming to evaluate their individual sensory impact on beverage global taste perception. The results demonstrated that sucrose, fructose, ascorbic acid, citric acid and malic acid have the greater individual sensory impact in the overall taste of a specific beverage. Furthermore, although organic acids were present in lower concentrations than sugars, their taste influence was significant and, in some cases, higher than the sugars’ contribution towards the global sensory perception...|$|E

50|$|The two {{traditionally}} recognized suborders of bats are the Megachiroptera (megabats), and the Microchiroptera (microbats/echolocating bats). Not all megabats {{are larger}} than microbats. The major distinctions between the two suborders are as follows. Microbats use echolocation; {{with the exception of}} the genus Rousettus, megabats do not. Microbats lack the claw at the second finger of the forelimb. The ears of microbats do not close to form a ring; the edges are separated from each other at the base of the ear. Megabats eat <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> or pollen. Most microbats eat insects; others may feed on <b>fruit,</b> <b>nectar,</b> pollen, fish, frogs, small mammals, or the blood of animals. Megabats have well-developed visual cortices and show good visual acuity, while microbats rely on echolocation for navigation and finding prey.|$|R
