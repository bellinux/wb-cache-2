5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|During {{its debut}} week in Japan, The Binding Blade reached #4 in the sales charts, with over 101,000 units. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the charts in May, having dropped to #17 and reached total sales of over 220,000 units.

5|$|During the 1960s, {{following}} {{the introduction of}} the supersonic English Electric Lightning in the interceptor role, the Hunter transitioned to being operated as a fighter-bomber and for aerial reconnaissance missions, using dedicated variants for these purposes. Two-seat variants remained in use for training and secondary roles with the RAF and the Royal Navy until the early 1990s. Sixty years after its original introduction <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> active service, being operated by the Lebanese Air Force until 2014.|$|E

5|$|The Green Library is FIU's main library, and is {{the largest}} {{building}} on campus, {{and one of the}} largest library buildings in the Southeastern United States. Originally designed by Architect David M. Harper in 1973, the Green Library was expanded by the architecture firm M. C. Harry & Associates, Inc. in the early 1990s to its current eight floors, with a capacity to expand to a total of 15 floors if necessary. The eight-floor structure was built over, through, and around the original three-story library while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> use.|$|E
5|$|The Loyal Order of Moose {{was founded}} in Louisville, Kentucky, {{in the spring of}} 1888 by Dr. John Henry Wilson. Originally {{intended}} purely as a men's social club, lodges were soon founded in Cincinnati, Ohio, St. Louis, Missouri and Crawfordsville and Frankfort, Indiana. The early order was not prosperous. Dr. Wilson himself was dissatisfied and left the order of the Moose {{before the turn of the}} century. When Albert C. Stevens was compiling his Cyclopedia of Fraternities in the late 1890s, he was unable to ascertain whether <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> existence.|$|E
5|$|Castlevania was rebooted {{due to the}} team's {{concern over}} the poor sales in their latest Castlevania games. The team wished to expand the franchise's fanbase with this game. A number of prototypes in {{parallel}} development competed {{to become the next}} Castlevania title. Konami told MercurySteam the game would be an original intellectual property (IP) when it was first greenlit as a Castlevania title. Konami eventually asked them to cease work on Lords of Shadow while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> its early stages, until David Cox showed the Japanese senior management the game and was offered help by video game designer Hideo Kojima. Konami then chose the pitch for it as the next Castlevania entry. The original concept for the game was to remake the first Castlevania starring Simon Belmont, but it was later decided to make a reboot of the franchise. Lords of Shadow still drew inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Castlevania for the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Super Castlevania IV.|$|E

5|$|Dead Phoenix {{was going}} to be a 3D shoot 'em up {{featuring}} a winged man named Phoenix. Based on trailer footage, IGN compared the gameplay to Panzer Dragoon. Players would take control of a winged man as he flies around shooting massive enemies, with the aid of allies on foot. Capcom's announcement described the setting as a mythical floating city, full of monsters and dragons. Game Informer announced that a Japanese release was planned in mid-2003. The game was believed to be canceled by May 2003, but Capcom stated at a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> development. IGN speculated that the game may have been retooled as a new Kid Icarus title, based on Nintendo's trend in the early 2000s of licensing properties to third parties. It was canceled in August 2003 after failing to appear at E3.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Sakurai {{confirmed}} {{that he was}} working on a new game through Project Sora. Uprising was officially announced at the 2010 Electronic Entertainment Expo alongside the announcement of the 3DS. In an interview closer to release, Sakurai said that he had misgivings about Uprising being shown off at gaming expos since 2010 while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> an unfinished state. As announced in 2011, the game suffered a delay that pushed its release into 2012. In January 2012, Sakurai announced via his Twitter feed that the game had gone gold. The game released on Japan on 22 March 2012; in Europe and North America on 23 March; and in Australia on 29 March. The game's box art was almost identical between its Japanese and English releases.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{annotation}} of {{the stone}} is in a church inventory from 1829, and it says that the stone was illegible. Ljungström documented in 1861 {{that it was in}} the rock fence with the inscription facing the cemetery. When Djurklou visited the stone in 1869, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the same spot. Djurklou considered its placement to be unhelpful because a part of the runic band was buried in the soil, so he commanded an honourable farmer to select a group of men and remove the stone from the wall. The next time Djurklou visited the location, he found the stone raised in the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|The park {{district}} {{does not}} appear to have moved the carousel after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> the same spot it had occupied for 38years. The carousel was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the carousel for almost 10years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The Indianapolis Art League objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them painted over with Disney characters.|$|E
5|$|The second {{break from}} the kirk was also {{prompted}} by issues of patronage. Minister Thomas Gillespie (1708–74) was deposed by the General Assembly in 1752 after he refused to participate in inducting a minister to the Inverkeithing parish, since the parishioners opposed the appointment. Gillespie was joined by two other ministers and they held {{the first meeting of}} the Presbytery of Relief at Colinsburgh in Fife in 1761. While evangelical in doctrine, the Relief Church did not maintain that it was the only true church, but stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>in</b> communion with the kirk and maintained contact with Episcopalians and Independents. Like the Associate Presbytery, the movement was initially small, but benefited from the Evangelical Revival of the later eighteenth century, which helped it expand rapidly.|$|E
