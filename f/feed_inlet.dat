40|$|The {{effect of}} the pumping {{direction}} of an axial flow impeller, the feeding rate {{and the number of}} <b>feed</b> <b>inlets</b> on the operation of a continuously-fed stirred tank has been studied using CFD. The flow patterns generated by the up-pumping and down-pumping impeller, under both ‘typical’ and ‘intensified’ operating conditions, are compared. The effect of various tank configurations on the performance of the vessel is assessed by analysing the flow and power numbers, as well as the concentration field of a non-reactive tracer. Furthermore, the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> jets are reduced using traditional jet similarity analysis and are compared with that of a typical round jet. The results show that up-pumping impellers improve circulation in {{the upper part of the}} tank and reduce shortcircuiting of the feed stream with only a small increase in power consumption. Furthermore, by using multiple <b>feed</b> <b>inlets</b> to increase the total throughput capacity, the amplitude of torque fluctuations is decreased and impeller bypassing is also decreased. The ensemble of conclusions suggest that the throughput capacity and mixing quality of a CSTR can be improved, without problems of short-circuiting, by employing up-pumping impellers coupled with multiple surface feed points...|$|R

40|$|The low thermal {{efficiency}} and low water production {{are among the}} major challenges that prevent membrane distillation (MD) process from being commercialized. In an effort to design an efficient multi-stage direct contact MD (DCMD) unit through mathematical simulation, a new phenomenon that we refer to as total water production capacity inversion (WPI) has been detected. It is represented by {{a decrease in the}} total water production beyond a number of stages or a certain module length. WPI phenomenon, which was confirmed by using two different mathematical models validated experimentally, was found to take place due to the decrease in water vapor flux across the membrane as well as the increase in heat loss by conduction as the membrane length increases. Therefore, WPI should be considered as a critical MD design-criterion, especially for large scale units. Investigations conducted for a simulated multi-stage DCMD process showed that <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> and permeate temperatures difference, feed and permeate flow rates, and feed salinity have different effects on WPI. The number of stages (or module length at constant width) that leads to a maximum water production has been determined for different operating parameters. Decreasing <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> and permeate temperatures difference, or <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> and permeate flow rates and increasing <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> temperature at constant temperature difference or <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> salinity cause the WPI to take place at lower number of stages. Even though the feed salinity affects negligibly the mean permeate flux, it was clearly shown that it can affect WPI. The results presented herein unveil a hidden phenomenon that is likely to occur during process scale-up procedures and should be considered by process engineers for a proper choice of system design and operating conditions...|$|R
50|$|In the {{conventional}} moving bed technique of production chromatography the feed entry and the analyte recovery are simultaneous and continuous, {{but because of}} practical difficulties with a continuously moving bed, simulated moving bed technique was proposed. In the simulated moving bed technique instead of moving the bed, the <b>feed</b> <b>inlet,</b> the solvent or eluent inlet and the desired product exit and undesired product exit positions are moved continuously, giving {{the impression of a}} moving bed, with continuous flow of solid particles and continuous flow of liquid in the opposite direction of the solid particles.|$|E
50|$|In {{the vortex}} {{separation}} process {{a mixture of}} uranium hexafluoride gas and hydrogen is injected tangentially into a tube at one end through nozzles or holes, at velocities close to the speed of sound. The tube tapers to a small exit aperture at one or both ends. This tangential injection of gas results in a spiral or vortex motion within the tube, and two gas streams are withdrawn {{at opposite ends of}} the vortex tube; centrifugal force providing the isotopic separation. The spiral swirling flow decays downstream of the <b>feed</b> <b>inlet</b> due to friction at the tube wall. Consequently, the inside diameter of the tube is typically tapered to reduce decay in the swirling flow velocity. This process is characterized by a separating element with a very small stage cut (the ratio of product flow to feed flow) of about 1/20, and high process-operating pressures.|$|E
50|$|The {{next step}} is to draw the {{operating}} line for the rectifying section (the section above the <b>feed</b> <b>inlet)</b> of the distillation column, (shown in green in Figure 1). Starting at the intersection of the distillate composition line and the x = y line, draw the rectifying operating line at a downward slope (Δy/Δx) of L / (D + L) where L is the molar flow rate of reflux and D is the molar flow rate of the distillate product. For example, in Figure 1, assuming the molar flow rate of the reflux L is 1000 moles per hour and the molar flow rate of the distillate D is 590 moles per hour, then the downward slope of the rectifying operating line is 1000 / (590 + 1000) = 0.63 which means that the y-coordinate of any point on the line decreases 0.63 units for each unit that the x-coordinate decreases.|$|E

Flow maldistribution in the microchannels was analyzed considering the combined effects of the two-phase flow characteristics (flow pattern, gas quality, mass fluxes and superficial velocities), microchannel-header arrangements (horizontal or vertical), and microchannel flow and header feeding orientations (horizontal, vertical upward or vertical downward). The header was loaded with two-phase mass fluxes of 72, 144 and 216 kg/m(2) s and the gas quality ranged from 0 to 0. 75. An increase in the flow rate homogeneity was noted for the arrangement horizontal header and horizontal microchannels, when the header was loaded parallel to the microchannels or perpendicularly from the header bottom. Highly heterogenous flow distributions occurred for the arrangement vertical header and horizontal microchannels. Preferential liquid feeding occurred in the microchannels far from the <b>inlet</b> <b>feeding</b> tube for <b>inlet</b> flows with high gas quality (over 10 %) and high gas superficial velocity (over 20 m/s) and with the inlet tube parallel to the microchannels. Preferential liquid feeding occurred in the microchannels close to the <b>inlet</b> <b>feeding</b> tube for <b>inlet</b> flows with a horizontal header and upward flows through the microchannels.

40|$|Abstract. Hydrocyclones are {{separators}} {{that are}} widely used in industry that belong to an important group of equipments designed to solid-liquid or liquid-liquid separation. The employment of hydrocyclones is generally restricted to an equipment need with a high classifying power (based {{on the size of}} particles collected in the underflow) or with a high concentrating capacity. The separation occurs by density difference or particle size distribution of the dispersed phase. In order to maximize the separation efficiency of these devices, the aim of this work was to study experimentally the consequences of an unusual feed in the behavior of a hydrocyclone. Therefore, tests were carried out with aqueous suspensions of phosphate rock at a fixed level of pressure drop equal to 1. 47 bar, using the optimized geometry hydrocyclone H 11.
