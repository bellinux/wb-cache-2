5000|$|A diet {{study of}} the spotted gar {{reported}} the diet of a spotted gar consists of four species of fish; golden topminnow, warmouth, bluegill, and spotted sunfish, which adds to 18.1% of total food volume in the stomach, while 57.5% of the stomach content was shrimp. Other invertebrates filled the remaining 23.6% of the stomach. Gar are also known to eat insect larvae and algae. Herbivorous fish eat the algae and zooplankton, and then herbivorous invertebrates are eaten by gar. Another food chain would be algae are eaten by herbivorous invertebrates and other carnivorous fish eat them, then they are eaten by the gar. Gar do not have many predators, only carnivorous fish would eat them, mainly at an early life stage. Gar are a main predator in the aquatic food chain in lakes and rivers. The fish would compete with other carnivorous fish such as the bowfin (Amia calva). In one study, most spotted gar were shoreline oriented, preferred submerged branches as cover, and avoided areas of <b>exposed</b> <b>bank.</b> [...] During a flood pulse, a floodplain provides habitat for spawning and nursery habitat for gar eggs. Movement rates were higher during the summer than during the fall and winter, and rates were greater at night than at dawn during both seasons. The temperature greatly affects their moving rates {{and their ability to}} range their home turf. When the water is warmer during the spring and summer, they travel more often than during the cold seasons. Spotted gars eat 70% of their food intake at night compared to dusk and dawn. Abiotic factors that affect the spotted gar by humans include destruction of habitat and increased sedimentation in the water. In 2002, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, Office of Water Resources, in coordination with the US Environmental Protection Agency, took fish tissue samples in the Lower Mississippi River to test for heavy metals and organic compounds. Spotted gar was found to be a cancer risk with high concentrations of heavy metals and organic compounds.|$|E

Wave-induced erosion rates ranged from 0. 5 to 2. 5 m yr-I at the northshore study site where fetch, and hence wave energy, was maximal.

Wave scour on an <b>exposed</b> <b>bank</b> caused undercutting and endstripping, while overwash resulted when water was forced {{over the top of the}} shoreline. Shoreline morphology and vegetation determined the type of erosion process and the rate of shoreline retreat. Shoreline retreat was offset by localized and dramatic accretion caused by sediment entrapment by drift logs bordering the shoreline. The eroding shoreline and ncarshore bed were sediment sources for the accretion.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} developed country banks exposed to the Asian financial crisis. To this end we pursued a double approach. The use of accounting as well as market data in parallel is determinant to come to a clear conclusion. Analyzed banks are mainly European and North American since international accounting requirements are not already fulfilled by Japanese banks and do not permit to follow the double approach. The use of market data is based on the assumption that asset prices reflect all available public information. The bad news coming from the in-crisis Asian countries is thus captured by <b>exposed</b> <b>bank</b> stock prices and can be measured using the event study methodology. This method requires to select news that are likely to have impacted exposed banks, to precisely define the date of the news releases and to look if banks abnormally reacted to these news. We found that most international European and North American banks defined as exposed according to our accounting analysis showed abnormal returns in reaction to news releases from Asian in-crisis countries. However these same banks do not seem to have been negatively impacted by the devaluation of the currency of these Asian countries. We conclude that most exposed banks were hedged against exchange rate risk but were not protected against a fall of their operating profits from Asian activities...|$|E

For small mammals, this could cause exposure to strong temperature fluctuations and increased predation risk, inducing severe stress and leading to alterations in the physical condition and behavior. To test this, we <b>exposed</b> <b>bank</b> voles (Myodes glareolus) to different temperature regimes and cues of predator threat under laboratory conditions. The test animals experienced either a stable but cool temperature regime resembling the stable conditions under snow cover, or an unstable temperature regime with cold nights and warmer days simulating the climate change scenario with unstable winter. After 3 weeks, the animals were additionally exposed to owl calls or sounds of non-predatory bird species. Stress levels, activity, food consumption, and body mass were monitored. We observed that the voles exposed to unstable temperatures adjusted their normal, mostly nocturnal, and circadian activity pattern towards a more diurnal rhythm without any significant responses in their stress level. Introducing the sound manipulation elevated the stress levels in females but not in males. The sound-induced stress levels did not differ between the temperature treatments. However, the temperature regime tended to affect anti-predator behavior as individuals experiencing unstable temperatures and a threatening sound decreased their overall activity, unlike individuals under stable temperature treatments. It seems that behavioral plasticity in bank voles may diminish the risk of accumulation of stress in cases of multiple simultaneous stressors...|$|E

40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11, 12, and 13, 2011, Athens, Georgia. This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} U. S. Geological Survey stream monitoring station measurements of total suspended solids (TSS) yield and stream bank erosion monitoring data with a suspended solids model developed by Brown and Caldwell and used by the Gwinnett County, Georgia Department of Water Resources (DWR) to inform its watershed improvement efforts. A comparison between modeled and average measured TSS yield results at each gauging station indicates that a reasonable match exists over the majority of compared watersheds. When removing two stations with {{less than five years}} of data (coinciding with a drought of record) and two outlier stations, the average absolute percent difference between modeled and measured results is 20. 1 %, which is within the sampling error associated with TSS measurements. In general, the model tends to over predict TSS yield. It assumes a streambank TSS loading rate of 12 lbs/ft 2 /yr per unit area of <b>exposed</b> <b>bank</b> as quantified in the field. Six years of measured streambank erosion rates has documented an average annual production of 7. 1 lbs/ft 2 /yr. The average measured TSS yields at two stations were substantially less than the modeled values. It is thought that other factors are influencing TSS export such as the age of build out conditions. A discussion is presented addressing the potential reasons for the divergence between modeled and measured results as well as the potential for model calibration.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 Concern {{regarding}} increased {{coastal erosion}} has heightened amid growing acceptance {{of global warming}} and associated sea-level rise. This study examines shoreline erosion in Flathead Lake, Montana due to five decades of artificially elevated lake levels. It provides a model to investigate coastal erosion associated with sea-level rise. The natural water level fluctuation in Flathead Lake is regulated witha dam, which has elevated the entire annual fluctuation approximately 0. 7 m on average. The annual rise in lake level is held for an extended duration at a regulated "full pool" level which is approximately 3 m above its natural base elevation, and the total transgression time for a complete cycle of lake level change has been increased from 100 days to over 300 days. Nearshore environments in Flathead Lake, are described as dissipative or reflective {{on the basis of}} a surf similarity parameter, grain size, morphology, number of breaking waves and angle of wave incidence. The relative resistance to foreshore and backshore erosion caused by anthropogenic lake level regulation is compared between the two nearshore configurations. Reflective systems are characterized by dynamic gravel beach faces and steep inshore shelves armored by wave-washed cobble. In contrast dissipative systems are characterized by sand-sized substratum, broad flat inshore shelves, and the presence of multiple linear bars approximately 350 m offshore. Five decades of regulated lake levels have resulted in extensive shoreline erosion (970 ha on the north shore of the lake) and a general reshaping of both types of nearshore environments, although dissipative shorelines have eroded faster. The presence of docks and other man-made structures on reflective beaches have accelerated erosion by intercepting longshore gravel transport. Shoreline erosion has ceased on the west side of the north shore as the varial zone, (that area between the maximum and minimum regulated lake levels), has reached an equilibrium slope. In contrast erosion and shoreline retreat continues on the east side, although the rate has slowed over the years in response to the development of a near equilibrium varial zone profile similar to that of the west side. However shoreline retreat is quite variable even along short stretches of shoreline. Variability in shoreline retreat results from three erosive processes, undercutting, endstripping and overwash. Undercutting and endstripping occur when waves scour an <b>exposed</b> <b>bank,</b> while overwash results when water is forced over the top of the shoreline bank or berm. Therefore shoreline elevation and morphology determine the type of erosion process, and the rate of shoreline retreat. Localized accretion also occurred due to sediment entrapment by drift logs bordering the shoreline. Drift logs naturally protect the shoreline from direct wave attack and once buried, provide new recruitment area for riparian vegetation. Alteration of lake level fluctuation has resulted in a transfer of annual wave energy from base elevations corresponding to the pre-dam nearshore shelf, to those corresponding with the limnetic foreshore environment, thereby inducing lake-wide erosion. The most extensive retreat has occurred along the low-lying dissipative north shore of the lake. Measured shoreline retreat along the north shore is compared to the retreat predicted by the Bruun Rule. The Bruun Rule under-predicted the actual measured shoreline retreat by as much as an order of magnitude. The redistribution of annual wave energy due to regulated lake level fluctuation is the main factor contributing to erosion, a factor that is not accounted for with the Bruun Rule. Therefore the redistribution of annual incident wave energy is examined in terms of an increased transgression time, a reduced range in lake level fluctuation, and an elevated lake level. Both transgression time and range in water level fluctuation affect the distribution of incident wave energy and were found to be more important to shoreline erosion than an elevated water level. An alternative regulation scheme incorporating both concerns for hydropower production and lake regulation is proposed and examined in terms of reducing erosion. Altering the transgression time of lake level fluctuation by changing the timing and increasing the rate of lake level drawdown, results in a significant reduction in the amount of annual wave energy that reaches the eroding full pool shoreline, thereby reducing the potential for shoreline erosion lake-wide. A lowered regulated full pooi lake level would decrease the intensity of overwash further reducing shoreline retreat related to that process of erosion. Natural gravel beaches can provide the backshore of coastal environments with a protective buffer from wave erosion. A case study is presented of the conceptual design and utility of an artificial perched gravel beach used to stabilize an eroding backshore on the reflective east shore of the lake. Boulders and cobbles were used as a stable platform to perch beach gravels above the previously eroding profile. A longshore exchange of gravel within the beach compartment was incorporated into the conceptual design. The structure has performed successfully during the three year monitoring period as exemplified by the lack of backshore erosion and the maintenance of the perched profile...|$|E
