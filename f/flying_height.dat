25|$|The {{next major}} hunting methods is the “high soar with {{vertical}} stoop”, {{which is used}} to attack birds in flight. Since they are outpaced and out-maneuvered by swift-flying birds, they can only usually attack slower-flying species such as geese and cranes. The golden eagle also requires a height advantage over their prey for this rarely observed technique to succeed. In one observed case, some Canada geese (Branta canadensis) in Montana were able to avoid predation by a golden eagle hunting them in this way by collectively gaining <b>flying</b> <b>height.</b> In another observation, a golden eagle was successful in knocking a ptarmigan out of a flying covey in Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|The HDD's {{spindle system}} relies on air density inside the disk {{enclosure}} {{to support the}} heads at their proper <b>flying</b> <b>height</b> while the disk rotates. HDDs require a certain range of air densities in order to operate properly. The connection to the external environment and density occurs through a small hole in the enclosure (about 0.5mm in breadth), usually with a filter on the inside (the breather filter). If the air density is too low, then {{there is not enough}} lift for the flying head, so the head gets too close to the disk, and there is a risk of head crashes and data loss. Specially manufactured sealed and pressurized disks are needed for reliable high-altitude operation, above about [...] Modern disks include temperature sensors and adjust their operation to the operating environment. Breather holes can be seen on all disk drives – they usually have a sticker next to them, warning the user not to cover the holes. The air inside the operating drive is constantly moving too, being swept in motion by friction with the spinning platters. This air passes through an internal recirculation (or [...] "recirc") filter to remove any leftover contaminants from manufacture, any particles or chemicals that may have somehow entered the enclosure, and any particles or outgassing generated internally in normal operation. Very high humidity present for extended periods of time can corrode the heads and platters.|$|E
2500|$|Golden eagles {{generally}} hunt grouse {{using the}} “contour flight with short glide attack” method, since grouse are {{often found in}} small groups. The usual response of the grouse is to take off in flight. If {{it is able to}} surprise the grouse, the eagle has a split second to grab the prey before it flies off. The eagle will frequently abandon the hunt after the grouse has flown, since it is unlikely to overtake such prey in the air unless it gains height over its quarry very quickly, although it may be able to gain the appropriate height to tail chase a grouse or even catch it while flying high using the “high soar with vertical stoop attack”. In Idaho a juvenile eagle was observed dropping a rock near a dusky grouse (Dendragapus obscurus), possibly attempting to spook it into flight so it could be overtaken from a <b>flying</b> <b>height</b> advantage. Although eagles equally attack both male and female grouse, when cock grouse display on “leks” in spring, they may be more distracted and easily found. Grouse tend to be prey of modest size for golden eagles, many species weighing little more than [...] An exception is the adult cock of the western capercaillie, which typically weighs over [...] In addition to their large size, cock capercaillie are exceptionally aggressive while on a lek and golden eagles have been observed to use different, bolder tactics while hunting them, even landing at the lek to confront and overpower feuding grouse.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{present the results}} of test flights {{performed}} with the large format digital photogrammetric camera system UltraCamX. Test flights are performed on a 5 * 7 sqkm large test site near Graz. Overall 520 images are captured in two different <b>flying</b> <b>heights</b> (GSD 10 cm and GSD 25 cm). During post-processing high resolution panchromatic and color images are processed in a fully automated workflow from the raw image data. At the same time systematic influences of the image geometry caused by temperature changes are automatically corrected. Information about the stitching process and the temperature correction are written to log files. A first analysis of the geometric quality can already be done using this information. After additional radiometric quality control an automated aerotriangulation (AAT) is performed for both <b>flying</b> <b>heights.</b> This is done with MatchAT (Inpho GmbH, Stuttgart) using the GPS navigation solution for the initial block setup. For each test flight in total 46 ground control points located in the test area have to be manually measured. A final bundle adjustment is done with the software BINGO (GIP, Aalen) using traditional as well as camera specific self-calibration parameters. BINGO is also used for a further analysis of the geometric quality of the UltraCamX system. This includes the visualization and numerical interpretation of certain key parameters like check point residuals, image residuals and self-calibration parameters. 1...|$|R

40|$|Research was {{conducted}} into improving {{the accuracy of}} photogrammetric absolute orientation, using a least squares surface matching algorithm rather than conventional ground control points (GCPs). To ascertain {{the success of the}} developed algorithm, a comparison between the two methods was carried out. Targets were laid at a test site, and near-vertical stereopairs of small format imagery were captured using a Kodak DCS 660 camera and microlight platform, from three <b>flying</b> <b>heights.</b> Stereomodels for each height were orientated using six GCPs as control, after which DEMs were extracted using automatic routines and compared with the remaining targets. For the surface matching orientation a kinematic GPS DEM of the test area was collected, and image stereomodels recreated – this time processed only to the relative orientation stage. DEMs were again extracted but were not yet in the desired reference system, requiring development of the matching algorithm. As an alternative means of performing the orientation, GCPs were bypassed and the GPS surface was used to register the unorientated DEMs. The matched surfaces were then compared with the checkpoints, showing a higher correspondence to the checkpoints for all three <b>flying</b> <b>heights.</b> This suggests that higher orientation precisions can be achieved with DEMs than using traditional GCPs, an especially important result for small format photogrammetry where more images and more GCPs are required. Although this study focused on small format imagery of a single area, implications on the wider discipline of photogrammetry are readily apparent. ∗ Corresponding author. 1...|$|R

The standard deviation of all laser returns from such a target decreases with lower flying altitude, as well as positional offsets computed tend to increase with flying altitude. The positional error along track is smaller than across track, probably due to different point spacing in these two directions. Target size and reflectance effects are assessed using wooden slats of different widths and colors. The effect of reflectance on target visibility is much larger than the effect of target size, which is in agreement to theoretical findings. Effective footprint size is attempted to be determined by slats with high reflectance forming a star. The difference between geometric (computed only by beam divergence) and effective footprint size increases with measurement distance, with the effective diameter being smaller than the geometric one. ...|$|R
