40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop improved polyamide (nylon) 11 (PA 11) and 12 (PA 12) polymers with enhanced flame retardancy, thermal, and mechanical properties for selective laser sintering rapid manufacturing. PA 11 and PA 12 were melt-blended, dispersing low concentrations of nanoparticles, namely nanoclays (NCs), carbon nanofibers (CNFs), and nanosilicas (NSs) via twin-screw extrusion. To enhance their thermal and flammability properties, an intumescent flame retardant (FR) was added to the mechanically superior NC and CNF PA 11 formulations. NC or CNF additions to either PA 11 or PA 12 generally increased its tensile strength and modulus, but sharply reduced its <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>rupture.</b> FR additives reduced PA 11 ’s properties considerably. This substitution, however, only exacerbated the already steep drop in <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> <b>rupture</b> due to FR additives alone; while elongation dropped 58 % with the addition of 30 wt % FR, it dropped 98 % with the addition of 25 wt % FR/ 5 wt % CNF.

40|$|AbstractForce {{generation}} and movement in skeletal muscle {{result from a}} cyclical interaction of overlapping myosin and actin filaments that permits the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to be converted into mechanical work. The rapid force recovery that occurs after a step release imposed on a muscle is thought to result from a synchronized tilting of myosin lever arms toward a position of lower free energy (the power stroke). We investigated the power stroke mechanism in intact muscle fibers of Rana esculenta using a fast stretch to detach forcibly cross-bridges. Stretches were applied either {{with or without a}} conditioning step release. Cross-bridge rupture tension was not significantly influenced by the release, whereas sarcomere <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> the <b>rupture</b> point increased immediately after the release and returned to the prerelease condition within 15 – 20 ms, following a slower time course compared to the recovery of tension. These observations suggest that the rupture force of a bridge is unaltered by a conditioning release, but rupture must first be preceded by a power stroke reversal, which restores the prepower stroke state. The sarcomere extension <b>at</b> the <b>rupture</b> point indicates both the extent of this power stroke reversal and the time course of strained bridge replenishment...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of EB radiation on the mechanical behaviour of UV curing polyacrylate rubber (ACM) and to simulate its behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: The material was irradiated by two different EB doses, 100 kGy and 250 kGy, its mechanical behaviour was investigated with the help of uniaxial, equibiaxial and planar shear experiments. The results were applied to the Ogden’s Model (1972) in order to obtain the parameters to simulate the material behaviour by finite element method (FEM) and to compare experimental and FEM curves. The structure molecular changes caused by EB were investigated with the help of infrared spectroscopy. Findings: In most cases the experimental results showed an increase in the strength <b>at</b> <b>rupture</b> and a decrease in the <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> the <b>rupture</b> with increasing of radiation dose. Equibiaxial and planar shear tests presented similar behaviour like uniaxial results, in terms of elongation decrease and strength increase, with some deviations. Ogden’s Model third order provided simulated curves with similar behaviour in comparison to experimental curves. The infrared spectroscopy showed different chemical group contents in the analyzed regions, surface and middle region. Research limitations/implications: Two doses of EB radiation were applied; higher or lower doses were not investigated. Practical implications: Improved behaviour of UV curing ACM can extend the range of industrial applications, or improve its performance in known applications. Originality/value: Usually EB radiation has been used to modify polymeric structure and to improve thermal and mechanical polymers behaviour. Regarding like rubber materials EB is usually applied as an alternative form of vulcanization. UV is a new type of curing for polyacrylate rubbers, which are usually cured by thermal processes...|$|R

The tensile strength and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break of all the dynamically vulcanized TPU/BR (70 / 30) blends using 1 -step processing are not {{higher than those of}} simple TPU/BR (70 / 30) blends. However, the tensile strength and elongation of the dynamically vulcanized blends prepared at 8 min (mixing time) using 2 -step processing are higher than those of the simple blends...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} filler loading on the tensile and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break of SMR 10 using a sulphur {{vulcanization}} system was studied. Carbon black (N 220) {{was used as}} the fillers and the loading range was from 10 to 40 phr. Two Roll Mill (Model LS- 22005) and 25 Ton Hot Cold Molding Press (Model LS 22025) used for mixing and molding press. Both equipments were supplied by Lotus Scientific. Tensile and <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break were determined using a Universal Testing Machine (Model 133004600771) operating at 20 mm/min. Results show that, <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> break decreases, but tensile strength, increase with filler loading. This observation is attributed to the rubber–filler interphaseinteraction of carbon black and rubber...|$|R
