40|$|We {{calculate}} the ground state and excited state second-order dispersion interactions between parallel π-conjugated polymers. The unperturbed eigenstates and energies are {{calculated from the}} Pariser-Parr-Pople model using CI-singles theory. Based on large-scale calculations using the molecular structure of trans-polyacetylene as a model system and by exploiting dimensional analysis, we find that: (1) For inter-chain separations, R, greater than a few lattice spacings, the ground-state dispersion interaction, ΔE(GS), satisfies, ΔE(GS) ∼L(2) /R(6) for L ≪ R and ΔE(GS) ∼L/R(5) for R ≪ L, where L is the chain length. The former is the London fluctuating dipole-dipole interaction while {{the latter is a}} <b>fluctuating</b> <b>line</b> dipole-line dipole interaction. (2) The excited state screening interaction exhibits a crossover from fluctuating monopole-line dipole interactions to either fluctuating dipole-dipole or <b>fluctuating</b> <b>line</b> dipole-line dipole interactions when R exceeds a threshold R(c), where R(c) is related to the root-mean-square separation of the electron-hole excitation. Specifically, the excited state screening interaction, ΔE(n), satisfies, ΔE(n) ∼ L∕R(6) for R(c) < L ≪ R and ΔE(n) ∼ L(0) ∕R(5) for R(c) < R ≪ L. For R < R(c) < L, ΔE(n) ∼ R(-ν), where ν ≃ 3. We also investigate the relative screening of the primary excited states in conjugated polymers, namely the n = 1, 2, and 3 excitons. We find that a larger value of n corresponds to a larger value of ΔE(n). For example, for poly(para-phenylene), ΔE(n = 1) ≃ 0. 1 eV, ΔE(n = 2) ≃ 0. 6 eV, and ΔE(n = 3) ≃ 1. 2 eV (where n = 1 is the 1 (1) B(1) state, n = 2 is the m(1) A state, and n = 3 is the n(1) B(1) state). Finally, we find that the strong dependence of ΔE(n) on inter-chain separation implies a strong dependency of ΔE(n) on density fluctuations. In particular, a 10 % density fluctuation implies a fluctuation of 13 meV, 66 meV, and 120 meV for the 1 (1) B(1), m(1) A state, and n(1) B(1) states of poly(para-phenylene), respectively. Our results for the ground-state dispersion are applicable to all types of conjugated polymers. However, our excited state results are only applicable to conjugated polymers, such as the phenyl-based class of light emitting polymers, in which the primary excitations are particle-hole (or ionic) states...|$|E

A widely used and successful model is the Directed Polymer (DP) in a random medium, pertaining to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. Much is known for this continuous model when the disorder is uncorrelated, and it has allowed to understand the static and dynamical features of experimental systems ranging from magnetic interfaces to liquid crystals. Short-range correlations in the disorder at a lengthscale ξ> 0 modify the uncorrelated (i. e. zero ξ) picture in a non-obvious way. If the geometrical fluctuations are still described by the celebrated 2 / 3 KPZ exponent, characteristic amplitudes are however modified even at scales much larger than ξ, in a well-controlled and rather universal manner.

40|$|Potassium {{channels}} {{are essential for}} maintaining a normal ionic balance across cell membranes. Central to this function {{is the ability of}} such channels to support transmembrane ion conduction at nearly diffusion-limited rates while discriminating for K+ over Na+ by more than a thousand-fold. This selectivity arises because the transfer of the K+ ion into the channel pore is energetically favoured, a feature commonly attributed to a structurally precise fit between the K+ ion and carbonyl groups lining the rigid and narrow pore. But proteins are relatively flexible structures that undergo rapid thermal atomic fluctuations larger than the small difference in ionic radius between K+ and Na+. Here we present molecular dynamics simulations for the potassium channel KcsA, which show that the carbonyl groups coordinating the ion in the narrow pore are indeed very dynamic ('liquid-like') and that their intrinsic electrostatic properties control ion selectivity. This finding highlights the importance of the classical concept of field strength. Selectivity for K+ is seen to emerge as a robust feature of a flexible <b>fluctuating</b> pore <b>lined</b> by carbonyl groups...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Proteins undergo {{thermally}} activated conformational fluctuations among {{two or more}} substates, but {{a quantitative}} inquiry on their kinetics is persistently challenged by numerous factors, including the complexity and dynamics of various interactions, along with the inability to detect functional substates within a resolvable time scale. Here, we analyzed in detail the current fluctuations of a monomeric β-barrel protein nanopore of known high-resolution X-ray crystal structure. We demonstrated that targeted perturbations of the protein nanopore system, {{in the form of}} loop-deletion mutagenesis, accompanying alterations of electrostatic interactions between long extracellular loops, produced modest changes of the differential activation free energies calculated at 25 °C, ΔΔG⧧, in the range near the thermal energy but substantial and correlated modifications of the differential activation enthalpies, ΔΔH⧧, and entropies, ΔΔS⧧.

40|$|The {{effect of}} thermal {{fluctuations}} near a contact {{line of a}} liquid interface partially wetting an impenetrable substrate is studied analytically and numerically. Promoting both the interface profile and the contact line position to random variables, we explore the equilibrium properties of the corresponding <b>fluctuating</b> contact <b>line</b> problem based on an interfacial Hamiltonian involving a "contact" binding potential. To facilitate an analytical treatment we {{consider the case of}} a one-dimensional interface. The effective boundary condition at the contact line is determined by a dimensionless parameter that encodes the relative importance of thermal energy and substrate energy at the microscopic scale. We find that this parameter controls the transition from a partially wetting to a pseudo-partial wetting state, the latter being characterized by a thin prewetting film of fixed thickness. In the partial wetting regime, instead, the profile typically approaches the substrate via an exponentially thinning prewetting film. We show that, independently of the physics at the microscopic scale, Young's angle is recovered sufficiently far from the substrate. The fluctuations of the interface and of the contact line give rise to an effective disjoining pressure, exponentially decreasing with height. Fluctuations therefore provide a regularization of the singular contact forces occurring in the corresponding deterministic problem. Comment: 40 Pages, 12 Figure...|$|R

In the limit of vanishing Josephson coupling between the layers a high-T_c superconductor {{is characterized by the}} London penetration depth #lambda#=#lambda#_a_b over which the supercurrents in the Cu-O-planes (ab planes) decay exponentially. Current flowing perpendicular to the layers (along the c axis) is disregarded and a superconductor is modeled as a stack of superconducting sheets of zero thickness which are isolated from each other. A magnetic field applied perpendicular to the layers induces currents only within the layers, and an Abrikosov vortex line consists of a stack of two-dimensional 'pancake' vortices. The prime achievement of this GIF project was the discovery of a novel long-range attraction between distorted Abrikosov vortex lines in anisotropic superconductors. As an illustration of this novel mechanism we have shown that in an anisotrpic layered superconductor a randomly <b>fluctuating</b> vortex <b>line</b> is attracted to a planar specimen surface by a long-range interaction decreasing as /x" 2.

40|$|A recent pupillometry {{study on}} adults with normal hearing {{indicates}} that the pupil response during speech perception (cognitive processing load) is strongly affected {{by the type of}} speech masker. The current study extends these results by recording the pupil response in 32 participants with hearing impairment (mean age 59 yr) while they were listening to sentences masked by fluctuating noise or a single-talker. Efforts were made to improve audibility of all sounds by means of spectral shaping. Additionally, participants performed tests measuring verbal working memory capacity, inhibition of interfering information in working memory, and linguistic closure. The results showed worse speech reception thresholds for speech masked by single-talker speech compared to <b>fluctuating</b> noise. In <b>line</b> with previous results for participants with normal hearing, the pupil response was larger when listening to speech masked by a single-talker compared to fluctuating noise. Regression analysis revealed that larger working memory capacity and better inhibition of interfering information related to better speech reception thresholds, but these variables did not account for inter-individual differences in the pupil response. In conclusion, people with hearing impairment show more cognitive load during speech processing when there is interfering speech compared to fluctuating noise. © 2014 Acoustical Society of America...|$|R
