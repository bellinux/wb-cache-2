[...] ("Hello, I am Bob Biswas... <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> minute?")—the monologue he repeatedly uses just before murdering his victims—was used in different memes.

You've got to let him sing it." [...] Muddy Waters' previous albums replicated {{the sound of his}} live performances. Working with a studio band rather than his own was problematic for Muddy Waters, who could not perform material from the album live. He stated [...] "What the hell <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> record for if you can't play the first time it's out? I'm so sick of that... If you've got to have big amplifiers and wah-wahs and equipment to make you guitar say different things, well, hell, you can't play no blues." ...|$|E
500|$|Like all {{the other}} republics of the Soviet Union, Armenia had its own flag and coat of arms. According to Nikita Khrushchev, the latter became a source of dispute between the Soviet Union and the Republic of Turkey in the 1950s, when Turkey objected to the {{inclusion}} of Mount Ararat, which holds a deep symbolic importance for Armenians but is located on Turkish territory, in the coat of arms. Turkey felt {{that the presence of}} such an image implied Soviet designs on Turkish territory. Khrushchev retorted by asking, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> moon depicted on your flag? After all, the moon doesn't belong to Turkey, not even half the moon... Do you want to take over the whole universe?" [...] Turkey dropped the issue after this.|$|E

2500|$|Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were {{recognized}} for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, {{two of the}} most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: [...] "How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?" [...] Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him {{to send a message to}} the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks [...] "on behalf of our Afghan brethren": [...] "Why should I send a message? Why are you talking on our behalf? Don't we have leaders here to talk on our behalf?" [...] Khan replied [...] "This is how it has been and how it will be. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> message?" [...] Massoud told the foreign minister that [...] "nobody who talks on our behalf will have any kind of result." [...] Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post-communist leader of Afghanistan.|$|E
