5|$|The {{first of}} three sons born in Adelaide,Unley to Martin and Jeanne (née Richardson), Chappell was steeped in the game from an early age. His father was a noted Adelaide grade cricketer who put a bat in his hands as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> and his {{maternal}} grandfather was famous all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who captained Australia {{at the end of}} a nineteen-Test career. Chappell was given weekly batting lessons from the age of five, as were younger brothers Greg and Trevor, who both also went on to play for Australia.|$|E
5|$|As soon as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> Braille {{spent time}} {{playing in his}} father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing {{with some of the}} tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed down hard to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|Growing up {{as part of}} a lucha libre {{family the}} future Espanto Jr. decided he wanted to follow in the {{footsteps}} of his father and grandfather at an early age. In a 2010 interview he recalled how he would be in the front row watching his father wrestle from the time <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk.</b> In 1996 his father suffered an injury during a match and was briefly clinically dead while in the ring until he was revived. While the injury left a big impression on the then-10 year old he later accepted that it was an accident and tried not to think about it, but did comment that his mother still worried about him every time he competed.|$|E
60|$|Stover {{was still}} {{suffering}} great pain, {{and he had}} lost so much blood that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarcely <b>walk.</b>|$|R
50|$|He was {{severely}} injured after being thrown from his horse. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> {{a great distance}} {{and had to be}} driven to his place of business.|$|R
6000|$|... "He saith true," [...] laughed Pirret. [...] "Truly, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> accoutred as he is. Give it a slit--out {{with your}} knife and slit it, gossip." ...|$|R
5|$|It was {{not until}} 12 January that Dukovac added to his tally, a Yakovlev Yak-1. On 25 February, Dukovac flew five sorties. On the first he and his wingman downed a Yak-1 each, and on the second he shot down a Yak and a P-39. During his fifth mission, he was shot down by P-39s and crash-landed, {{injuring}} his spine. He was evacuated to a field hospital, but returned to 15./JG 52 as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> ten days later, {{only to find that}} he had just three pilots fit for duty. Despite the pending arrival of newly trained pilots, the loss of another two pilots by mid-March led the Luftwaffe to decide that attempting to maintain 15./JG 52 was futile, and the men were sent home to the NDH. During its three tours, the Staffel had accounted for a total of 297 Soviet aircraft, of which Dukovac had 37 confirmed and eight unconfirmed aerial victories, seven of which were later confirmed. At the beginning of July, the Luftwaffe reconsidered its decision, and the newly promoted Hauptmann Dukovac and a group of veteran and fresh pilots began to make their way back to the Eastern Front. They were transported to Romania and then the Slovak Republic, but no aircraft were provided, and on 21 July the pilots were advised that the HZL was to be disbanded. Despite this, in August they were moved to an airfield in East Prussia, where they took delivery of ten Bf 109G-14s. At the beginning of September they flew to Lithuania in preparation to rejoin the fray.|$|E
25|$|Wüsthoff {{remained}} in French captivity in Château-Gontier until 1920. When {{he was finally}} released, he was malnourished and on crutches. He eventually improved to the point <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> again. Wüsthoff returned to aviation and flew for advertising campaigns.|$|E
25|$|Hawkins {{was born}} on April 18, 1914 in Fort Scott, Kansas. When he was a baby, he {{suffered}} an accident which scarred him for life. A neighbor accidentally spilled a can of scalding hot water over him {{and it was a}} year before his mother was able to cure the muscular damage by massage and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> again.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>could</b> have <b>walked</b> {{twice the}} {{distance}} in that time; but the delay was unavoidable, since {{only on the}} horse's back could his father be brought into camp.|$|R
25|$|Hugh, {{due to his}} gluttony, {{became so}} fat that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>walk,</b> earning him the {{nickname}} of le Gros (the Fat). He would also earn the nickname Lupus (Wolf) for his savage ferocity against the Welsh.|$|R
60|$|So Pharaoh listened, {{and when}} it was done he sent for Rames. Presently the boy was carried in, for he had lost so much blood that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk,</b> and was placed upon a stool before him.|$|R
25|$|Shancai {{fell down}} the cliff but was halted in midair by Guanyin, who now {{asked him to}} walk. Shancai found that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> {{normally}} {{and that he was}} no longer crippled. When he looked into a pool of water he also discovered that he now had a very handsome face. From that day forth, Guanyin taught Shancai the entire dharma.|$|E
25|$|Michael Colin Cowdrey {{was born}} on his father's tea {{plantation}} at Ootacamund, Madras Presidency, although his birthplace was usually misrecorded as Bangalore 100 miles to the north. His father made an application for him to join the prestigious Marylebone Cricket Club while still an infant. Cowdrey had no schooling in India, but his father and servants taught him cricket as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{instance}} of a Japanese atrocity was {{committed in the}} area of the rubber trees around Trolak. In this area were a number of Argyll and Hyderabad wounded. 2nd Lieutenant Ian Primrose reports that after he regained consciousness from an injury during the fighting he discovered that the Japanese were dividing the wounded into those who said they could walk and those who said they could not. Primrose decided <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> which was fortunate as the Japanese soldiers proceeded to shoot and bayonet the wounded who could not. Afterward the survivors were forced to dig graves for the dead and then told to carry the Japanese wounded.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{looks better}} and {{stronger}} than I expected, my lord," [...] Wulf said. [...] "You must remember when I last saw him <b>he</b> <b>could</b> scarce <b>walk</b> across the room, and in my heart I scarce hoped to ever see him again." ...|$|R
60|$|He didn't {{like the}} tone of voice in which Farmer Brown's boy spoke. He thought of Reddy Fox still so stiff and sore and lame that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>walk,</b> all from the shot which Farmer Brown's boy thought had missed.|$|R
60|$|It was {{impossible}} for him to follow them, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> only <b>walk</b> back sadly at mid-day along the same road which he had trodden hopefully in the morning. The lights were all changed for him both without and within.|$|R
25|$|Born in Unley, South Australia, Chappell was {{the second}} of three sons born in Adelaide to Arthur Martin and Jeanne Ellen (née Richardson), a Cornish Australian family. He was steeped in the game from a very early age: his father Martin was a noted grade cricketer in Adelaide who put a bat in his hands as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> while his {{maternal}} grandfather was the famous all-round sportsman Vic Richardson, who had captained Australia in Test cricket. Elder brother Ian and younger brother Trevor also played for Australia, and Greg closely followed in Ian's footsteps to the top. Given weekly lessons by coach Lynn Fuller, the brothers fought out fierce backyard cricket matches, with no holds barred. The fraternal relationship between Ian and Greg became legendary in Australian cricketing history for volatile verbal slanging matches, even during hard fought Test matches, which had their genesis in the family backyard.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} vein, though Laszlo {{asserts that the}} Nazis cannot arrest him, saying, [...] "This is still unoccupied France; any {{violation}} of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault," [...] Ebert points out, [...] "It makes no sense that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> around freely.... He would be arrested on sight." ...|$|E
500|$|Geiger {{was born}} on 29 March 1988 in Australia, but lived in Austria until he was eight. On 26 September 2009, he was {{involved}} in a car crash. The vehicle he was travelling in as a passenger slammed into a tree just [...] from his family's home in Bright, Victoria. He suffered severe injuries to his arm, spleen and liver as well as serious brain trauma. As a result, he was in an induced coma for a week. It took months before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk,</b> talk and eat independently again. As of August 2011, he had ten operations, extensive physiotherapy and speech therapy.|$|E
50|$|This was Sidney Toler's final {{film and}} his final one as the detective Charlie Chan, his 22nd of the series. Stricken with cancer {{during his last}} few films, Toler was so {{physically}} weak during filming that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> hardly <b>walk</b> or say his lines coherently.|$|R
60|$|His hips were thin; and the legs, {{lean and}} hairy, were crooked and stringy-muscled. In fact, my father's legs {{were more like}} arms. They were twisted and gnarly, and with {{scarcely}} the semblance of the full meaty calf such as graces your leg and mine. I remember <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> on the flat of his foot. This was {{because it was a}} prehensile foot, more like a hand than a foot. The great toe, instead of being in line with the other toes, opposed them, like a thumb, and its opposition to the other toes was what enabled him to get a grip with his foot. This was why <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> on the flat of his foot.|$|R
60|$|The boys, glad of a rest, {{waited for}} his return, until, {{after he had been}} absent nearly an hour, when <b>he</b> <b>could</b> easily <b>walk</b> the {{distance}} in twenty minutes, Bob and Ralph started in search of him, leaving Jim and Dick there in case he should return.|$|R
500|$|During his {{formative}} years Trenchard struggled academically, failing many examinations and only just succeeding {{in meeting the}} minimum standard for commissioned service in the British Army. As a young infantry officer, Trenchard served in India and with {{the outbreak of the}} Boer War, he volunteered for service in South Africa. While fighting the Boers, Trenchard was critically wounded {{and as a result of}} his injury, he lost a lung, was partially paralysed and returned to Great Britain. On medical advice Trenchard travelled to Switzerland to recuperate and boredom saw him taking up bobsleighing. [...] After a heavy crash, Trenchard found that his paralysis was gone and that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> unaided. Following further recuperation, Trenchard returned to active service in South Africa.|$|E
500|$|Biographical {{accounts}} {{published by}} the Church of Scientology describe Hubbard as [...] "a child prodigy of sorts" [...] who rode a horse before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> {{and was able to}} read and write by the age of four. A Scientology profile says that he was brought up on his grandfather's [...] "large cattle ranch in Montana" [...] where he spent his days [...] "riding, breaking broncos, hunting coyote and taking his first steps as an explorer". His grandfather is described as a [...] "wealthy Western cattleman" [...] from whom Hubbard [...] "inherited his fortune and family interests in America, Southern Africa, etc." [...] Scientology claims that Hubbard became a [...] "blood brother" [...] of the Native American Blackfeet tribe at the age of six through his friendship with a Blackfeet medicine man.|$|E
500|$|Born in Boston, Massachusetts, as {{the only}} son of Janice (née Hare) and Robert Bagwell, Jeff Bagwell and {{his family moved to}} Killingworth, Connecticut, when he was one year old. [...] Much of Bagwell's family is from the Greater Boston area, {{including}} both his parents, and are avid fans of the Boston Red Sox. [...] His favorite player, Carl Yastrzemski, was a longtime left fielder for the Red Sox. [...] Robert, from Watertown, pitched college baseball at Northwestern University and as a semi-professional. [...] Janice, a police officer, grew up in Newton and played softball in local Boston leagues until her 20s. [...] Bagwell's parents divorced when he was 11. [...] Precocious and demonstrating much athletic ability early in life, he played a wide variety of sports as a youth. [...] Recalled Janice, Jeff [...] "could throw a ball before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk.</b> [...] When he was six months old, we’d throw a ball to him and he would throw it back." ...|$|E
50|$|Semyour S. Kety {{was born}} in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1915. Raised in a humble family {{household}} in Philadelphia, Kety was intellectually challenged and stimulated. As a child, Kety {{was involved in a}} car accident that injured his foot. Though <b>he</b> <b>could</b> still <b>walk,</b> Kety remained slightly physically impaired.|$|R
5000|$|The {{sequence}} in which Labiche is shot and wounded by German soldiers while fleeing across a pedestrian bridge was necessitated by {{a knee injury}} Lancaster suffered during filming - he stepped in a hole while playing golf, spraining his knee so severely that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> without limping.|$|R
60|$|When they parted, Bartley {{still found}} himself wakeful. He {{knew that he}} should not sleep if he went home, and he said to himself that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> about all night. He turned into a gayly-lighted basement, and asked for {{something}} {{in the way of a}} nightcap.|$|R
500|$|Born in Fort Smith, Arkansas on January 24, 1917, Sims {{was one of}} 12 children. The family soon {{relocated}} to Los Angeles, California, where he was raised. Describing his childhood, Sims said, [...] "It was just a whole big dancing family." [...] He learned to dance from his father, {{and said he was}} dancing as soon as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk.</b> He began tap-dancing at the age of 3. He attributed some of his early love for tap dancing in particular to his mother, exasperated that he kept wearing out the toes of his shoes, putting steel taps on the shoes. Along with his brothers, Sims was dancing on the sidewalks of Los Angeles from a young age. At the age of 14, peeping in the windows of a dance school got Sims arrested for loitering, but he was able to dance his way to freedom, convincing a judge that his reason for being on that street was legitimate.|$|E
2500|$|Cohan {{was born}} in 1878 in Providence, Rhode Island, to Irish Catholic parents. A baptismal {{certificate}} from St. Joseph's Roman Catholic Church (which gave the wrong first name for his mother) indicated that he was born on July 3, but Cohan and his family always insisted that George had been [...] "born on the Fourth of July!" [...] George's parents were traveling vaudeville performers, and he joined them on stage while still an infant, first as a prop, learning to dance and sing soon after <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> and talk.|$|E
2500|$|The arch was {{dedicated}} by Humphrey on May 25, 1968. He {{declared that the}} arch was [...] "a soaring curve in the sky that links the rich heritage of yesterday with the richer future of tomorrow" [...] and brings a [...] "new purpose" [...] and a [...] "new sense of urgency to wipe out every slum." [...] "Whatever is shoddy, whatever is ugly, whatever is waste, whatever is false, will be measured and condemned" [...] {{in comparison to the}} Gateway Arch. About 250,000 people were expected to attend, but rain canceled the outdoor activities. The ceremony had to be transferred into the visitor center. After the dedication, Humphrey crouched beneath an exit as he waited for the rain to subside so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>walk</b> to his vehicle.|$|E
60|$|Left {{to himself}} again, after the solicitude and {{compassion}} {{of his last}} adventure, he was naturally in a thoughtful mood. As naturally, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>walk</b> on thinking for ten minutes without recalling Flora. She necessarily recalled to him his life, with all its misdirection and little happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Small {{conversion}} {{he needed}} when I {{was here to}} watch him, colonel. And he rides with any trooper I ever laid eyes on. Why, sir, I myself threw him on a saddle before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> well-nigh <b>walk,</b> and 'twere a waste of material {{to put him in}} the navy." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{lyrics of}} [...] "Who Are You" [...] were {{inspired}} by an incident Townshend experienced.
