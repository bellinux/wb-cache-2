The lighthouse, operated by Marina Militare with the identification number 2184 E.F, is active and fully automated, has a solar power unit and emits a single white flash in a five seconds period visible up to 13 nautical miles.|$|R
50|$|To {{the west}} of the square is the Manueline pillory of Póvoa de Varzim, erected in 1514. It is a {{national}} monument and represents the municipal emancipation of Póvoa de Varzim. In front and {{in another part of the}} square, there's the Statue of Eça de Queirós, erected in 1952. It is of the authorship of Master Leopoldo de Almeida. The monument was offered by Povoan settlers in Rio de Janeiro. Next to the pillory, the square’s historical and romantic gazebo follows the liking of the old Povoan bourgeoisie for its spare time. With <b>hexagonal</b> <b>plant,</b> the gazebo is an illustration of cast iron architecture, with a very noticeable oriental influence, despite being stylized and geometric.|$|R
2500|$|The {{building}} had originally a round plan with an outer diameter of 11.2 m, and was perhaps surmounted by a dome. [...] On {{the south side}} there was a rectangular apse. The interior was hexagonal, and each side was adorned with a rectangular niche. Surveys executed before the demolition revealed window-like openings in the foundation (made of rubble) which hint {{to the presence of}} a crypt also during the early phase of the building. The brickwork of the above ground structure was made with freestone interlined with clay bricks. The Palaiologan-era burial chamber, measuring 2.9 m x 3.17 m, was covered with a flat dome. During the conversion into a mosque, the old entrance was closed with masonry because of the erection of the minaret, and a new entrance on the northwest side was opened. In the last phase of its life the edifice had a wooden roof and kept its internal <b>hexagonal</b> <b>plant,</b> with a deeply arched recess on each side, five of them bearing a window and one the entrance gate. Outside the building showed four alternating sides, two circular bearing two windows each and two projecting bays bearing respectively one window and the entrance gate. In front of the building the Ottomans erected a porch. During the demolition in 1930 traces of paintings stemming from the Palaiologan period could be still observed. On that occasion some architectural elements were dismantled and since then have been kept at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} many {{different}} biological problems concerning cellulose biosynthesis. Cellulose {{is made by}} all plants, and therefore it {{is probably the most}} abundant organic compound on Earth. Aside from being the primary building material for plants, this biopolymer is of great economic importance globally because it is the major constituent of cotton (over 94 %) and wood (over 50 %). Moreover, according to how it is treated, cellulose {{can be used to make}} paper, film, explosives, and plastics, in addition to having many other industrial uses. The paper in this book, for example, contains cellulose, as do some of the clothes we are wearing. In addition to higher plants, cellulose is synthesized by a number of bacterial species, algae, lower eukaryotes (tunicates), and the slime mold Dictyostelium. The function of cellulose in these different groups of organisms reflects the diverse role associated with this simple structural polysaccharide. Whereas it is possible for some organisms, specifically bacteria, to survive in absence of cellulose synthesis, it may not be true for most vascular plant cells. As such, the importance of cellulose in the life of a plant cannot be overemphasized since it not only provides the necessary strength to resist the turgor pressure in plant cells, but also has a distinct role in maintaining the size, shape and differentiation of most plant cells. The aim of this thesis is to investigate, by mean of theoretical methods, coupled to simulation techniques, the polymerization, crystallization, and self-organization mechanism of this universal distributed polysaccharide, in different biological systems. We start in Chapter 2 with a general description of the chemical and mechanical features of the cellulose microfibrils (CMFs), the crystalline form of cellulose in nature. After a brief overview on the biogenesis of the CMFs in the plant cells we proceed focusing on two of the most important cellulose producer entities: the plant cells and the Acetobacter cells. The first part of the thesis, therefore, is concerned with all the aspects related to cellulose biosynthesis in the cell-wall of plant cells. We begin in Chapter 3 with a detailed investigation on the self-assembly mechanism of the Cellulose Synthase Complex (CSC) in higher <b>plants,</b> the <b>hexagonal</b> Rosette CSC: based on the known experimental evidences regarding the internal structure of this protein, we are able to build a theoretical scheme to characterize the interactions among the CSC subunits; then, by mean of a Monte Carlo algorithm, we implement this interaction scheme in a simulation that document step by step the formation of the hexagonal enzyme. Our model is able to explain the assembly of many types of CSCs, like the <b>hexagonal</b> Rosettes of <b>plants</b> as well as the linear CSCs present in bacteria and the clusters that form in the cell wall of some algae. After having clarified the formation of the Rosette CSC structure, we shift our attention to its motion in the plasma membrane of plant cell. In Chapter 4 we present a biophysical model that unravels the force generating mechanism underlying the propulsion of the Rosette CSC: the model identifies polymerization and crystallization as driving forces, and elucidates the role of polymer flexibility and membrane elasticity as force transducers. On the basis of our model and appropriate values for the relevant physical constants, we obtain a theoretical estimate for the velocity of the CSC that is in agreement with the experimental value. To have a proof a principle of the proposed mechanism, we have also developed a stochastic simulation that reproduces the movement of the Rosette CSC in the fluid membrane of the plant cell. The last issue related to plant cells cellulose is the formulation of a mathematical model to analyze the building of cell wall architecture (Chapter 5). The highly regular textures observed in cell walls reflect the spatial organization of the cellulose CMFs. Based on a geometrical hypothesis proposed earlier, we formulate a model that describes the space-time evolution of the density of Rosette CSCs in the plasma membrane of plant cell. The trajectories of the Rosettes are assumed to be governed by an optimal packing constraint of the CMFs that couples the direction of motion to the density of the CSCs. Our model is based on a relatively small numbers of variables that can be tuned to obtain most of the cell wall textures that have been found experimentally. Moreover, we demonstrate that it is also robust against a number of perturbations and noise effects. The second part of the thesis is focused on the cellulose-producing Acetobacter cells, which live at the air-liquid interface and which exhibit a peculiar motion during the cellulose polymerization process. The mechanism of formation as well as the structure of the bacterial cellulose has been studied extensively in recent decades. The cellulose product appears as a long ribbon, composed of many CMFs, which extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of the cell, and which is synthesized by a linear array of particles placed along the axis of the bacterial rod. Goal of this chapter (Chapter 6) is to correlate the peculiar motion of Acetobacter with an hydrodynamic effect caused by the interactions between the cellulose CMFs and the fluid in which they are immersed. To further assess the correctness of our model, in the last part of the thesis we implement a Brownian Dynamics simulation that is able to reproduce the main features of this particular bacterial motion. With this work we hope to contribute in elucidating some key questions, both regarding the cell biology of plants as well as concerning the physics of interacting filaments and complex macromolecular assemblies. ...|$|R
