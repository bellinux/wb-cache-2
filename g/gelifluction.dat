40|$|This paper reports {{results from}} two scaled {{centrifuge}} modelling experiments, designed to simulate thaw-related <b>gelifluction.</b> A planar 12 ° prototype slope was modelled in each experiment, {{using the same}} natural fine sandy silt soil. However two different scales were used. In Experiment 1, the model scale was 1 / 10, tested in the centrifuge at 10 gravities (g) and in Experiment 2, the scale was 1 / 30, tested at 30 g. Centrifuge scaling laws indicate that the time scaling factor for thaw consolidation between model and prototype is N 2, where N {{is the number of}} gravities under which the model was tested. However, the equivalent time scaling for viscous flow is 1 / 1. If <b>gelifluction</b> is a viscosity-controlled flow process, scaling conflicts will therefore arise during centrifuge modelling of thawing slopes, and rates of displacement will not scale accurately to the prototype. If, however, no such scaling conflicts are observed, we may conclude that <b>gelifluction</b> is not controlled by viscosity, but rather by elasto-plastic soil deformation in which frictional shear strength depends on effective stress, itself a function of the thaw consolidation process. Models were saturated, consolidated and frozen from the surface downwards on the laboratory floor. The frozen models were then placed in the geotechnical centrifuge and thawed from the surface down. Each model was subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles. Soil temperatures and pore water pressures were monitored, and frost heave, thaw settlement and downslope displacements measured. Pore water pressures, displacement rates and displacement profiles reflecting accumulated shear strain, were all similar at the two model scales and volumetric soil transport per freeze-thaw cycle, when scaled to prototype, were virtually identical. Displacement rates and profiles were also similar to those observed in earlier full-scale laboratory floor experiments. It is concluded therefore that the modelled <b>gelifluction</b> was not a time-dependent viscosity-controlled flow phenomenon, but rather elasto-plastic in nature. A first approximation flow law is proposed, based on the Cam Clay constitutive model for soils...|$|E

Thirteen 1 / 10 scale planar slope models were frozen {{from the surface}} downwards on the laboratory floor and thawed, also from the surface downwards, under gravitational acceleration of 10 gravities (approximately 98. 1 ms' 2). A natural sandy silt soil from Quaternary periglacial slope deposits collected in SW England formed the base test material and slope models at gradients 4, 8, 12 and 16 were constructed using this soil. 10 % and 20 % by weight increments of glaciolacustrine silt and Kaolinite clay {{were added to the}} natural soil and a series of slope models were constructed at gradients of 4, 8, and 12 using these soils. Each slope model was subjected to four cycles of freezing and thawing except for the four slope models that underwent rapid slope failure. During thaw, soil temperatures and pore water pressures were recorded continuously, together with soil thaw settlement and surface displacement. Following each experiment, models were sectioned to observe displacement columns that showed the profiles of soil movement and allowed volumetric displacements to be calculated. It was shown that thaw settlement and slope gradient strongly affected the rate of surface movement and the subsurface profile of movement. Increasing slope gradient generated greater amounts of subsurface and surface movement as a function of increased gravitational shear stress. Thawing ice lenses inclined parallel to the slope gradient provided localised zones of microshearing in response to localised low frictional resistance. Rates of movement increased between the 4 and 8 models, but a greater increase occurred between the 8 and 12 models. A slope failure was initiated within the 16 slope model. Rates of <b>gelifluction</b> were dominantly influenced by increasing silt content impacting upon the distribution of segregated ice and the reduction of frictional shear strength. Increasing silt content generated high positive porewater pressures commonly in excess of hydrostatic and consequently greater amounts of pre-failure strain. A clear behavioural threshold was identified between the 10 % and 20 % silt soils, with far greater <b>gelifluction</b> in the latter than the former. Increasing clay content had a less pronounced impact upon rates of <b>gelifluction</b> when compared to increasing silt due to cohesion. Rates of movement increased between the 10 % and 20 % clay in response to lower shear strength. A sawtooth style of pore pressure response caused by water escape events within the 20 % clay prevented maximum potential pressures being achieved and possibly impacted upon the overall rate of <b>gelifluction.</b> A successful simulation of both landsliding and slow mass wasting processes was undertaken and future applications for the technique have been outlined.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a sequence of}} stratified quartzite slope deposits and alluvial fan gravels from a small catchment at Rocky Cape. A lower series of indurated slope deposits overlain by a podzol soil profile suggests that cold climatic conditions, which favoured frost fracturing of exposed 13 rock surfaces and <b>gelifluction</b> of detritus, occurred prior to the Last Glacial Stage. An upper series of unconsolidated slope deposits contains wedge structures. These deposits appear to have resulted from frost fracturing and to have been moved downslope by <b>gelifluction</b> processes.

Active and inactive periglacial features were located, mapped and described. Of particular interest were periglaciar slope deposits including <b>gelifluction</b> turf-banked lobes and stone lobes, and cryoturbation features including polygons and thufur. Local environmental factors, such as aspect, moisture, topography, soil texture and depth of freezing, appear to act as important controls on the spatial distribution of the periglacial features. Identification and quantification of periglacial processes in the regolith was investigated using temperature and soil moisture sensors coupled to dataloggers. Research was undertaken over a 16 month period from June 1995 to September 1996 so that comparisons between the winter conditions of 1995 and 1996 could be drawn. The Tiffindell area was observed to be characterised in the winter months by 'diurnal freezethaw days', as well as by 'ice days', 1996 experiencing colder temperatures than 1995. With more than 78 % of the days from May to September 1996 being 'ice days', and simultaneously experiencing high soil moisture contents, freezing penetration to a depth of greater than 0. 2 m was observed to occur in the Tiffindell area, causing frost heave and <b>gelifluction.</b> The summer thaw of ice lenses that developed in the cold winter months caused surface movement downslope of <b>gelifluction</b> lobes of up to 39 mm over an 18 month period, although movement declined rapidly with depth and was essentially restricted to the uppermost 130 mm of the regolith. Other features such as sorted and non-sorted polygons and thufur were identified and found to be active under the present climatic conditions and depth of frost penetration at Tiffindell. Stone lobes were identified on the south and southeast-facing slopes at Tiffindell, but are apparently inactive under present climatic conditions.

40|$|Abstract: A set of 196 14 C dates {{was used}} to {{reconstruct}} Late Holocene aeolian activity in the Hudson Bay area along a south-north transect crossing the northern boreal forest, the forest tundra and the shrub tundra zones. The record indicates a minor period of aeolian activity between 4650 and 4050 BP, and three major periods at 3650 - 2750 BP and after 700 BP. In the northern boreal forest, there was little temporal variation in dune activity, except around 1300 - 950 BP where a major peak of activity is recorded. In the forest tundra, two major peaks of activity are recorded between 1650 - 950 BP and after 700 BP. Only minor activity occurred in the shrub tundra during the last 4000 14 C-yr and some aeolian events {{appear to have been}} slightly out-of-phase compared to the two other zones. Most dates were obtained from non-charred material in the shrub tundra where, unlike in the Subarctic, the aeolian activity responded to a triggering process unconnected with fire. The dune record is compared with that of <b>gelifluction</b> activity in snowpatch environments and with a detailed fire chronology derived from radiocarbon-dated conifer charcoal sampled in present-day treeless sites of the forest tundra. Post-fire <b>gelifluction</b> reached a maximum around 1500 - 1100 BP and 750 BP. Fire activity was also at a maximum after 2000 BP in the forest tundra.

40|$|The Authors {{describe}} a sequence some 4 metres thick composed of slope and loess deposits which lies {{at an altitude}} of 360 metres, 20 metres above the Torrente Agna. The series belongs to a polyciclic soil composed of 4 lithostratigraphic units which, from the bottom to the top, are as follows: - slightly weathered loess (IV CI); - red clayey soil sediments (Ill B 2) resulting from the erosion of a more ancient paleosol of «Terra Rossa» type, developed during the Middle Pleistocene {{at the top of the}} Carvanno Tarvertine; - undisturbed loess and loess displaced by <b>gelifluction</b> (II B 21 till B 231); - recent colluvial deposits (A I + B 1). The sequence was deposited between the Upper Pleistocene and the Holocene. During the Upper Pleistocene the loess deposition, alternated with colluvial and <b>gelifluction</b> phases, was caused by cold-humid climatic conditions. During the postglacial, the loess was affected by weathering which lead to the development of an alfisol. The micromorphological analysis evidenced several stages in the postglacial soil forming process. First, in unstable geomorphological conditions, complex cutans (scheletans-matransiltans) covered the walls of the soil pores. In a later period, as a result of landscape stability, laminated and birefringent [erri-argillans were mainly deposited. The deposition of the upper colluvial cover (AI + BI) and the coarse fills of the underlying horizons were produced by a degradational phase due to the deforestation of the area in historical times.

The small sample size that this method permitted is compatible with sampling from sensitive sample locations. An oscillating 10 Pa shear stress was applied to samples at - 0. 5 kPa water potential. Two freeze-thaw cycles had temperature ramps from 5 °C to - 10 °C over 2 h, followed by - 10 °C to 5 °C over 2 h and finally at 5 °C for 1 h. At freezing onset, the shear modulus, G, dropped to 4 – 50 per cent of thawed G, with no differences between locations. At thawing onset, G dropped to 8 – 32 per cent of thawed G, with significant differences between locations (P < 0. 001). Thixotropy was then measured by applying a 2 kPa oscillating shear stress for 10 min, followed by relaxation at 10 Pa for 2 h. The increased shear stress caused G to drop to less than 8 per cent of the pre-stressed value, with no difference between locations. After 0. 1 and 2 h, G was 18 – 65 per cent and 31 – 82 per cent of the pre-stressed value, respectively. A shear ramp determined yield stresses ranging from 494 – 2217 Pa. These findings demonstrate the potential risk of more frequent freeze-thaw cycles or the occurrence of thawed soil to the stability of polar soils. <b>Gelifluction</b> through more frequent freeze-thaw cycles could result in increased slope movement, whereas thixotropy caused by trampling of thawed soils could exacerbate mechanical damage of surface soils.

The distributional patterns of vascular plants, lichens and bryophytes were primarily affected by complex responses to substrate texture, soil moisture content and substrate disturbance.

40|$|Abstract: New {{sections}} and detailed mapping of the Pleistocene deposits {{on the west}} side of the Malvern Hills show that the area occupied by ice during a pre-Devensian glaciation was greater than previously envisaged. The deposits associated with the glaciation occur in a palaeovalley and comprise lacustrine silts and clays and till. They are considered to be of Anglian age as they are locally overlain non-sequentially by newly described silts of probable late Anglian to early Hoxnian age, the most westerly record of such deposits in southern Britain.

The permafrost conditions lead to solifluctuation and <b>gelifluction</b> process producing immature soils and triggering the natural geomorphic hazards, such as snow and rock avalanches, landslides, and fluvio-glacial erosion. The hazards have been largely responsible in the generation of mass movement and other catastrophic activities that result in high morpho-dynamic activity of weathering, breaking of ice, and damming and bursting of lakes causing the desertification of the region.

40|$|International audiencePhysical {{modelling}} {{has been}} developed in order to simulate the effects of periglacial erosion processes {{on the degradation of}} slopes and scarps. Data from 41 experimental freeze–thaw cycles are presented. They attest to the efficiency of periglacial processes that control both erosion and changes in scarp morphology: (i) cryoexpulsion leads to an increase of scarp surface roughness and modifies significantly the internal structure of the active layer; (ii) combined effects of frost creep and <b>gelifluction</b> lead to slow and gradual downslope displacements of the active layer (0 · 3 cm/cycle); (iii) debris flows are associated with the most significant changes in scarp morphology and are responsible for the highest rate of scarp erosion; (iv) quantification of the erosion rate gives values close to 1 cm 3 cm− 2 for 41 freeze–thaw cycles. These experimental results are consistent with field data acquired along the La Hague fault scarp (Normandy, France) where an erosion rate of 4 · 6 ± 1 m 3 m− 2 per glacial stage has been computed from the volume of natural slope deposits stored during the Weichselian glacial stage. These results show that moist periglacial erosion processes could lead to an underestimation of Plio-Quaternary deformation in the mid-latitudes...|$|E
40|$|The Mt. Vechernyaya (272 m {{above the}} {{surrounding}} sea level) area covers several square kilometers and the exposed bedrock area {{can be divided}} into western and eastern sections by an ice/snow body running north-south in the middle. The present landforms of the study area are primarily the results of selective erosion by the ice sheet, which was influenced by geologic factors such as joints, gneissosity and rock types. The joint-controlled linear trends in topography are very evident. Another characteristic of the area is step-like topographies. In the western section, five levels of relatively flat surfaces can be recognized, while in the eastern section, four levels can be distinguished. Steps are interpreted as the results of selective/differential erosion along the old faults, joints and geologic contacts, coupled with different lithologies. Tills are widespread, particularly in the lower area of the eastern section, although the cover is thin. Erratics are relatively small, typically less than 30 cm in long axis and usually subangular to subround with relatively fresh appearance. Development of tafoni on erratics is very good, and so is development of sorted patterned grounds (chiefly polygons) on the tills. At present, it appears that periglacial processes such as freeze and thaw, <b>gelifluction</b> and nivation are strongly working in this area...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{analyses}} {{have been}} carried out in permafrost environment in Victoria Land, Continental Antarctica, in 9 sites within the network of the sensitive system permafrost-vegetation for the assessment of climate change effects along a latitudinal and geographical transect (77 ° - 72 °S). Within each site the samples have been collected in different ecological and environmental conditions concerning active layer thickness, vegetation type and coverage, substrata, occurrence of glacial and periglacial features. In each site the vertical profile of the ground have been described and the samples collected within the active layer representing all the layers with visible differences regarding texture, structure and color. Organic C and N show specific patterns allowing to discriminate: a) vegetated vs unvegetated sites; b) among the unvegetated sites, ground with and without disturbance processes, mainly represented by frost heave and salt concrections. The barren grounds with frost heave and/or salt efflorescences show highest values of organic C and N. In the vegetated sites, organic C and N show different patterns related to the vegetation type and to their ecological requirements in terms of nutrient regime. The higher values are associated in particular with moss communities and with ground colonized by nitrophytic epilithic lichens. On inundated grounds the content of both organic C and N increases respect to close sites with similar vegetation. On the contrary, bacteria have a wide range of variability (between complete sterile soils to a more than 100 K of cells/g soil) with less clear patterns of spatial distribution. In the surficial layers (< 5 cm) in the unvegetated sites the higher bacteria values couple with the higher values of Al and Fe, but not with the organic C and N. In these sites the higher bacteria values are always associated to the more xeric conditions while the only really sterile site is the true inland one (Cape Sastrugi). Although the vegetated sites show more abundant bacteria, the highest values have been found within unvegetated <b>gelifluction</b> terracettes soils. The vertical distribution of the measured parameters show regular patterns, with lower values at the surface, maximum at intermediate depth, and a decrease in the deeper parts of the profile, except for C and N in some sites with a progressive decrease with depth. These depths are consistent with the values of active layer thickness characterizing the different sites. The vertical profile of the bacteria are differentiated between vegetated soils and barren grounds, the former with the higher values in the upper layers, the latter with an opposite pattern. The relatively high values of bacteria in barren grounds and in strongly disturbed soils (as <b>gelifluction</b> terracettes) need further research especially because in literature these Antarctic environments have been considered sterile and therefore not particularly sensitive to the climate change...|$|E
40|$|Abrupt {{climate warming}} during glacial–interglacial {{transitions}} promotes regional thermokarst activity {{in areas of}} ice-rich permafrost. The ensuing thaw-related processes of melt-out, soft-sediment deformation and resedimentation may produce widespread thermokarst sediments and sedimentary structures. Examples of the most distinctive thermokarst sediments and sedimentary structures from the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands, western Arctic Canada, comprise: (1) soft-sediment deformation structures (thermokarst involutions) in a palaeoactive layer; (2) ice-wedge casts and composite-wedge casts; (3) peaty to sandy diamicton deposited mainly by debris flows in retrogressive thaw slumps; and (4) a basal unit of diamicton and/or impure sand in some thermokarst-basin sequences, deposited by progradation of resedimented materials in thermokarst lakes. Many of the thermokarst sediments and sedimentary structures in the Tuktoyaktuk Coastlands formed {{as a result of}} rapid climate warming during the last glacial–interglacial transition, although some continue to form at present due to local (non-climatic) factors. Identification of thermokarst sediments and sedimentary structures in the geological record requires evidence for the thaw of excess ice. Direct evidence for the former occurrence of excess ice includes: (1) ice-wedge casts; (2) composite-wedge casts; (3) lenticular platy microstructures in frost-susceptible sediment; (4) certain near-surface brecciation of frost-susceptible bedrock; and (5) ramparted depressions attributed to the decay of frost mounds. Indirect evidence for former excess ice results where thaw consolidation initiates soft-sediment deformation or <b>gelifluction...</b>|$|E
40|$|An {{overview}} {{is presented}} of the periglacial characteristics of climate and landforms in Finland. Mean annual air temperature (MAAT) in Finland ranges from + 5. 5 to - 3 °C, and frost sums {{in most parts}} of the country are large enough for active seasonal frost. Local conditions are more important in the formation of frost features than the overly general mean values of air temperature, however. Snow depth is the critical factor for most frost features, and permafrost is observed only in northern parts of the country, where thin snow cover supports frost activity. A brief description of features indicating frost activity is presented. Palsas, pounus, and string mires are peat landforms designed by frost. Fell slopes exhibit additional features of talus, slush flows and <b>gelifluction</b> lobes and terraces. Frost heave and contraction cracking are characteristic features occuring even in fields in southern Finland. Active frost-sorted patterned grounds are common in northern Finland, especially at the bottoms of shallow, seasonally dry ponds. Ground water close to the surface is essential for the formation of most frost features. Special forms of both aeolian and fluvial activity are part of the periglacial environment in Finland. Snow drift and deflation of sand surfaces formed by glaciofluvial processes during deglaciation are part of the periglacial environment in Lapland. Drastic spring floods with ice dams formed in river channels are typical for northern rivers. Proposals for further studies are made at the end of the paper...|$|E
