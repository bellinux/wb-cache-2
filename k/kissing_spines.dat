2500|$|A {{veterinarian}} or experienced horse owner can palpate {{the back}} of a horse to pinpoint sources of pain and from there assess the most likely cause. [...] Radiographs (X-Rays) can be used to diagnose potential problems with cracked vertebrae, some forms of arthritis, impinging dorsal spinous processes (<b>kissing</b> <b>spines),</b> and other skeletal problems, although with large, heavily muscled animals this diagnostic modality is limited. [...] Certain types of soft tissue injury can be assessed with other modern diagnostic imaging techniques, such as ultrasound. In addition, Scintigraphy is often very useful in localising either bony or soft tissue disorders.|$|E
50|$|Long term, poor saddle fit {{may cause}} {{multiple}} back {{problems for the}} horse. It is possible for the horse's topline muscles to deteriorate, or for the horse to develop the wrong muscles. The muscles of the back just rear of the withers may atrophy, causing hollows right behind the shoulders, giving the withers the appearance of being higher and sharper. Horses may also lose muscle tone from traveling with a hollowed back, leading to increased risk of lordosis ("swayback"), <b>kissing</b> <b>spines,</b> or pinched nerves. For riders, spending long hours in a poorly fitting saddle may result in lower back pain {{as a consequence of}} incorrect pelvic angle. Saddles that are too small may also cause discomfort if the rider's seat is pushed into contact with the pommel.|$|E
40|$|Alterations in the thoracolumbar {{spine of}} {{racehorses}} are frequent and often significantly decrease their athletic performance. The most common thoracolumbar alteration in thoroughbred horses is <b>kissing</b> <b>spines</b> syndrome (KSS). The narrowing of the interespinous space, generally located between T 14 -T 15 and T 15 -T 16, produces this syndrome. A radiographic study {{was performed to}} 30 thoroughbred horses on the segment between T 12 and T 18. Two latero-lateral views from digital equipment were obtained of the T 12 to T 18 segment of each horse, the images were analyze and the radiographic findings established the KSS according to a grading scale. The study sample was homogeneous {{and the results were}} similar to other radiographic findings of KSS occurring in segments T 14 -T 15 and T 15 - 16...|$|E
40|$|Study DesignRetrospective case-control study. PurposeTo {{determine}} whether <b>kissing</b> <b>spine</b> {{is a risk}} factor for recurrence of sciatica after lumbar posterior decompression using a spinous process floating approach. Overview of LiteratureKissing spine is defined by apposition and sclerotic change of the facing spinous processes as shown in X-ray images, and is often accompanied by marked disc degeneration and decrement of disc height. If <b>kissing</b> <b>spine</b> significantly contributes to weight bearing and the stability of the lumbar spine, trauma to the spinous process might induce a breakdown of lumbar spine stability after posterior decompression surgery in cases of <b>kissing</b> <b>spine.</b> MethodsThe present study included 161 patients who had undergone posterior decompression surgery for lumbar canal stenosis using a spinous process floating approaches. We defined recurrence of sciatica as that resolved after initial surgery and then recurred. <b>Kissing</b> <b>spine</b> was defined as sclerotic change and the apposition of the spinous process in a plain radiogram. Preoperative foraminal stenosis was determined by the decrease of perineural fat intensity detected by parasagittal T 1 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Preoperative percentage slip, segmental range of motion, and segmental scoliosis were analyzed in preoperative radiographs. Univariate analysis followed by stepwise logistic regression analysis determined factors independently associated with recurrence of sciatica. ResultsStepwise logistic regression revealed <b>kissing</b> <b>spine</b> (p= 0. 024; odds ratio, 3. 80) and foraminal stenosis (p< 0. 01; odds ratio, 17. 89) as independent risk factors for the recurrence of sciatica after posterior lumbar spinal decompression with spinous process floating procedures for lumbar spinal canal stenosis. ConclusionsWhen a patient shows <b>kissing</b> <b>spine</b> and concomitant subclinical foraminal stenosis at the affected level, we should sufficiently discuss the selection of an appropriate surgical procedure...|$|R
50|$|Baastrup's sign, or <b>kissing</b> <b>spine,</b> is an {{orthopedic}} and radiographic disorder that often occurs in elderly humans. It {{is characterized by}} enlargement of the posterior spinous projections of the lumbar spine, with normal intervertebral disc height and neuroforamina. The reason it {{is referred to as}} <b>kissing</b> <b>spine</b> is because the posterior spinous processes 'kiss' and touch one another as the individual goes into lumbar extension, for example when flat on their stomach. The condition has been seen in humans, canines, particularly with boxer breeds, and certain breeds of horses. This disorder is named after Christian Ingerslev Baastrup.|$|R
30|$|Baastrup’s disease (Baastrup’s sign, <b>kissing</b> <b>spine</b> syndrome) {{should be}} {{included}} in the list of potential causes of low-back pain. Imaging findings can be illustrated with various techniques (X-rays of the spine, CT, MRI, scintigraphy and PET-CT), which can be performed either solely or in combination. The hallmark of imaging findings is the close approximation and contact of adjacent spinous processes with all the subsequent findings, including oedema, cystic lesions, sclerosis, flattening and enlargement of the articulating surfaces, bursitis and occasionally epidural cysts or midline epidural fibrotic masses.|$|R
50|$|ESWT {{has been}} shown to {{increase}} healing times and rate of successful return to work in horses with suspensory ligament desmitis. It has also been shown to improve lameness in horses suffering from navicular syndrome, and to treat chronic back pain, as seen with <b>kissing</b> <b>spine.</b> It may improve the healing time of burns and wounds of the lower limb. ESWT has also been shown to produce analgesic effects for osteoarthritis when used over a joint, although it does not modify the disease process itself.|$|R
50|$|ESWT is {{commonly}} used for treating orthopedic problems in horses, including tendon and ligament injuries, <b>kissing</b> <b>spine,</b> navicular syndrome, and arthritis. Because it can produce temporary analgesia, usually around 4 days, {{care must be taken}} not to push the horse too hard after treatment, since the animal may not guard the injury as well as they did previously. ESWT is often used in conjunction with rest and other therapies to help return the horse to soundness. Since the treatment is slightly uncomfortable, horses are sedated for treatments.|$|R

40|$|Background: Any spine {{structure}} that is innervated by afferent nociceptive nerve fibers {{is a potential}} pain generator. In the lumbar spine, the most studied pain generators in-clude: sacroiliac joints, the zygapophysial joints, the intervertebral discs, myofascial struc-tures. Anomalous lumbosacral articulations, the spinous processes, and lumbar spine os-teophytes are less commonly reported. Objective: To describe the diagnostic and therapeutic features of “kissing spine ” dis-ease or Baastrup’s Sign with particular attention to MRI findings and fluoroscopically-guided injection therapy. Design: A series of 3 patients with axial low back pain presented with exam findings and MRI changes suggestive of pain emanating from adjacent spinous processes that ap-peared to be in direct contact or very closely opposed. This has been described in the lit-erature as “kissing spine ” disease or Baastrup’s sign. Fluoroscopically-guided injections were performed and the responses were studied. Results: The 3 patients had MRI findings consisting of inflammation and/or edema in the spinous processes and surrounding soft tissues. Fluoroscopically-guided injections provided pain relief in all 3 patients. One patient with recurrent pain eventually under-went successful surgical resection of the involved spinous processes. Conclusion: Painful adjacent and closely opposed spinous processes can {{be a source of}} axial low back pain. We have described MRI features and the responses to fluoroscopi-cally-guided injections in 3 patients with this condition. Key words: Baastrup’s, <b>kissing</b> <b>spine,</b> spine injectio...|$|R
30|$|Proposed therapies include {{conservative}} {{course of}} analgesics and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs, percutaneous infiltrations with long acting corticosteroids mixed to local anaesthetic or surgical therapies such as excision of the bursa or osteotomy [8, 9, 13, 15, 16, 19]. Specifically for the percutaneous infiltrations, imaging guidance ensures accurate needle positioning with resultant increase of technical and clinical efficacy {{and at the}} same time decrease of potential complications rate [20]. Surgery with either partial or total excision of the spinous processes does not always result in pain alleviation [13]. The moderate efficacy of surgical approaches led certain investigators to the theory that <b>kissing</b> <b>spine</b> syndrome is not an actual disease but rather a part of degenerative spinal changes, mainly spondylosis with osteophyte formation [10, 13]. More recent studies suggest that Baastrup’s sign should raise the suspicion of a bursitis [11].|$|R
40|$|Baastrup's {{disease is}} one of the rare causes of low back pain. It is {{characterized}} by the close approximation and contact of adjacent spinous processes (<b>kissing</b> <b>spine).</b> The apposing surfaces of the spinous processes demonstrate enlargement, flattening and sclerosis.
