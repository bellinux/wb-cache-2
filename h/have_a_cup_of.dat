500|$|The album's title {{comes from}} a saying which Fanning {{explained}} to The Age as [...] "you offer someone tea and sympathy, you sit down with them, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea and you just talk." [...] He noted {{that there is a}} credit on an album by The Rolling Stones for the provision of [...] "tea and sympathy". [...] The album cover photography and album inlay photography is by Ami Barwell ...|$|E

Though Jerry does not want to go—he has made plans, he doesn't know the people—his mother coerces him: [...] "At least come and say hello, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee, then you'll leave." [...] Jerry knows it won't be that simple, so he persuades Elaine to attend, too. (To their unspoken dismay, she is seated at the kiddie table, lower than the grown-ups.) ...|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} L.A. Takedown lay in real life. Michael Mann, the film's {{producer}} and screenwriter, cited producer, screenwriter and Chicago ex-police officer Chuck Adamson as {{an inspiration for}} the character of Vincent Hanna. Mann, who collaborated with Adamson on Miami Vice and Crime Story and several minor projects, was told of an investigation Adamson partook in. In 1963, he was investigating Neil McCauley, a professional robber. According to Mann, [...] "one day they simply bumped into one another. [...] didn't know what to do: arrest him, shoot him or <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee." [...] Adamson later killed McCauley in a stand-off after a failed robbery.|$|E

2500|$|Reddy {{became a}} {{naturalized}} American citizen in 1974, subsequently availing herself {{of the opportunity}} to maintain dual American/Australian citizenship when the opportunity was made available. [...] "I feel like I'd like to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea and a good cry," [...] Reddy said after the ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, major renovations {{were made}} to the Mahane Yehuda Market, {{including}} infrastructure work, repaving roads and covering some open areas. [...] The market's Board of Directors worked to make at least some of these changes in response to a decrease in visitors after terrorist attacks in 1997 and 2002 killed 23 people. Changes driven by the Board included renovations to the streets and alleyways, but also included efforts to draw in cafes and boutiques that would entice more middle-class customers who might become frequent shoppers. According to Eli Mizrachi, chairman of the Mahane Yehuda Merchants Association, whereas shoppers used to come to buy produce, the [...] "new generation" [...] wants a place with entertainment, a place to sit and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee, and a place to shop for gifts.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, Yusuf Islam {{stated that}} the song {{is very similar to}} his song [...] "Foreigner Suite," [...] {{recorded}} under his former stage name, Cat Stevens. He said [...] "My son brought it to my attention and said: 'Doesn't that sound like 'Foreigner Suite?'" [...] Islam said that any legal action he might take [...] "depends on how well Satriani does." [...] Coldplay drummer Will Champion denied the claim, stating, [...] "We're confident we haven't done anything wrong." [...] In June 2009, Islam later said, [...] "They did copy my song but I don't think they did it on purpose," [...] adding, [...] "I don't want them to think I am angry with them. I'd love to sit down and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea with them and let them know it's okay." ...|$|E

2500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began at Island Records' newly opened Basing Street Studios, London, {{at the same}} time as Jethro Tull's Aqualung in December 1970. Upon the recommendation of Fleetwood Mac, the band then moved to Headley Grange, a remote Victorian Estate house in East Hampshire, England, to conduct additional recordings. Here they used the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Jimmy Page later recalled: [...] "We needed the sort of facilities where we could <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea and wander around the garden and go in and do what we had to do." [...] This relaxed, atmospheric environment at Headley Grange also provided other advantages for the band. As is explained by Dave Lewis, [...] "By moving into Headley Grange for the whole period of recording, many of the tracks [...] were made up on the spot and committed to tape almost there and then." ...|$|E
2500|$|Inuit {{often are}} {{relentless}} in making known {{that they are}} not like Qallunaat {{in the sense that they}} do not eat the same food and they are communal with their food. Qallunaat believe that the person who purchases the food is the owner of the food and is free to decide what happens to the food. Searles describes the Inuit perspective on food by saying that [...] "in the Inuit world of goods, foods as well as other objects associated with hunting, fishing, and gathering are more or less communal property, belonging not to individuals but to a larger group, which can include multiple households." [...] Food in an Inuit household is not meant to be saved for the family who has hunted, fished, gathered, or purchased it, but instead for anyone who is in need of it. Searles and his wife were visiting a family in Iqaluit and he asked for permission to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> orange juice. This small gesture of asking was taken as offensive because Inuit do not consider food belonging to one person.|$|E
2500|$|Critics {{argue that}} it will cause consumers, {{particularly}} those less wealthy and educated, to avoid needed and appropriate healthcare {{because of the cost}} burden and the inability to make informed, appropriate choices. [...] "Consumer-driven healthcare is badly named, because it's certainly not driven by consumers," [...] said Jonathan Oberlander. It is [...] "really just shifting the cost of healthcare onto the backs of the patients". People with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, will be hurt, because with a deductible of $3000 to $4000, such people {{will never be able to}} save anything in their savings accounts. [...] "Employers like it because they're going to save money," [...] but they're not going to fund these healthcare accounts adequately, he said. [...] "Conservatives tend to support consumer-driven healthcare. They believe, as do a fair number of health economists, that people use too much healthcare, and use too much healthcare of little value. If you move to high-deductible plans, people will think twice. If I have a sore throat, instead of going to my physician, I'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea instead." ...|$|E

5000|$|In late 1862, prisoners {{inside the}} fort were fed {{three meals a}} day instead of the usual two. [...] "For breakfast we <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> poor coffee without milk or sugar, and two small pieces of bad bread.
