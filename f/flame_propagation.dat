25|$|The British company Rotron, which specialises in {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) {{applications of}} Wankel engines, has designed and built a unit to operate on heavy fuel for NATO purposes. The engines uses spark ignition. The prime innovation is <b>flame</b> <b>propagation,</b> ensuring the flame burns smoothly across the whole combustion chamber. The fuel is pre-heated to 98 degrees Celsius before it is injected into the combustion chamber. Four spark plugs are utilised, aligned in two pairs. Two spark plugs ignite the fuel charge {{at the front of}} the rotor as it moves into the combustion section of the housing. As the rotor moves the fuel charge, the second two fire a fraction of second behind the first pair of plugs, igniting near the rear of the rotor at the back of the fuel charge. The drive shaft is water cooled which also has a cooling effect on the internals of the rotor. Cooling water also flows around the external of the engine through a gap in the housing, thus reducing the heat of the engine from outside and inside eliminating hot spots.|$|E
2500|$|The exact {{location}} of the initial fire, its source of ignition, {{and the source of}} fuel remain subjects of debate. The cause of the accident has never been determined conclusively, although many hypotheses have been proposed. Sabotage theories notwithstanding, one hypothesis often put forth involves a combination of gas leakage and atmospheric static conditions. Escaping hydrogen gas (in this specific case from incomplete or damaged vents {{along the top of the}} vessel and especially near the rear upper tail fin) will typically burn after mixing with air and will explode when mixed with air in the right proportions. This, along with the high static collected from flying within stormy conditions could have combined to ignite the leaking gas and down the airship. In addition, a certain amount of gas may have been inexplicably lost out the top of the vessel for, at the same time, water ballast was noticeably released to slow the rate of descent. The initial explosion would therefore have been the result of the quickening fire reaching the gas bags themselves via the compromised aft-most vent at the vessel's stern. Another more recent theory involves the airship's outer covering. The silvery cloth covering contained material including cellulose nitrate which is highly flammable. This theory is controversial and has been rejected by other researchers because the outer skin burns too slowly to account for the rapid <b>flame</b> <b>propagation</b> and gaps in the fire correspond with internal gas cell divisions, which wouldn't be visible if the fire spread across the skin first. Hydrogen fires had previously destroyed many other airships.|$|E

40|$|The <b>flame</b> kernel <b>propagation</b> is {{believed}} to be influenced by many operating parameters such as mixing level, turbulent intensity, and the mixture equivalence ratio. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the effect of the mixture equivalence ratio and turbulence intensity on the flame kernel and flow field interlinks in partially premixed natural gas flames. Three jet equivalence ratios of 1, 1. 5, and 2 are considered at values of jet velocities in the range from 10 to 20 m/s. This study was done under constant degree of partial premixing. A pulsed Nd: YAG laser is used for the flame ignition, and the turbulent flow field is captured at several time intervals from ignition using two-dimensional Planar Imaging Velocimetry (PIV). The mean flow field doesn’t influence with the <b>flame</b> kernel <b>propagation.</b> The turbulent flow field indicates an increase in the global turbulence intensity in flames associated with the kernel propagation in comparison with the isothermal case. The jet equivalence ratio of one enhances the <b>flame</b> kernel <b>propagation</b> and it gives the highest rate of kernel propagation.

In this work, three bends with different angles ranging from obtuse to acute were examined, {{and the effect of}} bend positions on gas explosions was also studied in the experiments. It was found that the peak overpressure evolutions under three different angles experienced three different stages, i. e. a slight downtrend before the bend, a sudden uptrend in and after the bend, and a following downtrend. The explosion violence was enhanced due to a reflection wave and flame tip wrinkle. The peak overpressure increased when the bend angles decreased because of stronger reflection and turbulence under a smaller bend angle. Additionally, the bend shortened the distance at which the peak overpressure reached its maximum values. However, the bend positions had little effect on the maximum overpressure in the ducts...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flame</b> development, <b>propagation,</b> stability, {{combustion}} efficiency, pollution formation, {{and overall}} system efficiency {{are affected by}} the early stage of flame generation defined as flame kernel. Studying the effects of turbulence and chemistry on the <b>flame</b> kernel <b>propagation</b> is the main aim of this work for natural gas (NG) and liquid petroleum gas (LPG). In addition the minimum ignition laser energy (MILE) has been investigated for both fuels. Moreover, the flame stability maps for both fuels are also investigated and analyzed. The flame kernels are generated using Nd:YAG pulsed laser and propagated in a partially premixed turbulent jet. The flow field is measured using 2 -D PIV technique. Five cases have been selected for each fuel covering different values of Reynolds number within a range of 6100 - 14400, at a mean equivalence ratio of 2 and a certain level of partial premixing. The MILE increases by increasing the equivalence ratio. Near stoichiometric the energy density is independent on the jet velocity while in rich conditions it increases by increasing the jet velocity. The stability curves show four distinct regions as lifted, attached, blowout, and a fourth region either an attached flame if ignition occurs near the nozzle or lifted if ignition occurs downstream. LPG flames are more stable than NG flames. This is consistent with the higher values of the laminar flame speed of LPG. The <b>flame</b> kernel <b>propagation</b> speed is affected by both turbulence and chemistry. However, at low turbulence level chemistry effects are more pronounced while at high turbulence level the turbulence becomes dominant. LPG flame kernels propagate faster than those for NG flame. In addition, flame kernel extinguished faster in LPG fuel as compared to NG fuel. The propagation speed is likely to be consistent with the local mean equivalence ratio and its corresponding laminar flame speed. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|Subject of {{this work}} is the {{advancement}} of detailed physical models to capture the three-dimensional combustion process in modern spray-guided spark-ignition engines. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the ignition process, which requires the reproduction of the complex interactions of fuel injection, ignition, and early <b>flame</b> front <b>propagation.</b> In spray-guided spark-ignition engines, the major part of the distinctively stratified fuel/air-mixture is consumed by a propagating turbulent flame front. Its modeling approach is based on the concept of the G-equation, simulating the <b>propagation</b> of the <b>flame</b> front by solving a kinematic equation for its surface. The propagation results from the flow velocity on the one hand, and from the turbulent burning velocity, which models the burning rate, on the other hand, respectively. This thesis is structured as follows: After the introduction, the conservation equations of fluid mechanics, along with the applied turbulence model, are presented in chapter two. Afterwards, the fundamentals of the physical and numerical modeling concepts of turbulent <b>flame</b> front <b>propagation</b> and auto-ignition are discussed in the third and fourth chapter, respectively. In chapter five, the developed ignition model for spray-guided spark-ignition engines is presented. There, the already introduced modeling fundamentals are extended to capture both the auto-ignition process of the mixture along the spark channel and the consequent quasi-laminar and eventually turbulent <b>flame</b> front <b>propagation.</b> In chapter six, the numerical implementation of the combustion model into the used 3 D CFD code is exemplified and validated. Afterwards, the physical combustion model is validated in chapter seven, using experimental data of premixed turbulent combustion in a constant-volume vessel and in a natural gas spark-ignition engine. In chapter eight, the developed model is applied to simulate combustion in a spray-guided spark-ignition engine. The results are qualitatively and quantitatively compared to measurements.
