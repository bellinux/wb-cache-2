5|$|The {{plan for}} 1711 again called for land and sea-based attacks, but its {{execution}} was a disaster. A fleet of 15 ships {{of the line}} and transports carrying 5,000 troops led by Admiral Hovenden Walker arrived at Boston in June, doubling the town's population and greatly straining the colony's ability to provide necessary provisions. The expedition sailed for Quebec at the end of July, but a number of its ships foundered on the rocky shores near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog.</b> More than 700 troops were lost, and Walker called off the expedition. In the meantime, Nicholson had departed for Montreal overland but had only reached Lake George when word reached him of Walker's disaster, and he also turned back. In this expedition, the Iroquois provided several hundred warriors to fight with the English colonists, but they simultaneously sent warnings to the French about the expedition, effectively playing both sides of the conflict.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the year, {{near the}} ruins of Nineveh, Heraclius engaged Rhahzadh before {{reinforcements}} could reach the Persian commander. The Battle of Nineveh took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog,</b> reducing the Persian advantage in missile troops. Heraclius feigned retreat, leading the Persians to the plains, before reversing his troops to the surprise of the Persians. After eight hours of fighting, the Persians suddenly retreated to nearby foothills, but the battle did not become a rout. During the battle, approximately 6,000 Persians were killed. Patriarch Nikephoros' Brief History suggests that Rhahzadh challenged Heraclius to personal combat, and that Heraclius accepted and killed Rhahzadh in a single thrust; two other challengers fought against him and also lost. However, he received an injury to his lip.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped back to shore. During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E

25|$|The {{fishing was}} {{actually}} carried out in small boats, carrying {{only two or three}} fishermen. Many of these small boats would be lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog</b> and never returned to the ship. As technology evolved, the three-mast boats disappeared, giving way to steamers, then to diesel-engined vessels. These days, only a small fishing fleet survives, restricted to fishing around coastal waters. In the harbour, pleasure-boats have taken the place of all but a few fishing-boats.|$|E

25|$|Diffraction grating {{effects are}} {{sometimes}} seen in meteorology. Diffraction coronas are colorful rings surrounding {{a source of}} light, such as the sun. These are usually observed {{much closer to the}} light source than halos, and are caused by very fine particles, like water droplets, ice crystals, or smoke particles in a hazy sky. When the particles are all nearly the same size they diffract the incoming light at very specific angles. The exact angle depends {{on the size of the}} particles. Diffraction coronas are commonly observed around light sources, like candle flames or street lights, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fog.</b> Cloud iridescence is caused by diffraction, occurring along coronal rings when the particles in the clouds are all uniform in size.|$|E
