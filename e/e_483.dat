What {{appears to be}} an additional character for separating the larvae of this species from those of An. bengaZensis Puri is recorded. Harrison and Scanlon (1975) described a new species in the AnopheZes aitkenii group in Thailand. They named it abermns because many of the adults had abdominal segments IV and V much paler than the other segments, an unusual character. In the limited time available they searched for spe-cimens of aberrans from outside Thailand, and among a series of 10 slides of larval skins from peninsular Malaysia in the British Museum (Nat.

40|$|The direct {{catalytic}} conversion of methane to liquid oxygenated compounds, such as methanol or dimethyl ether, at low temperature using molecular oxygen {{is a grand}} challenge in C–H activation {{that has never been}} met with synthetic, heterogeneous catalysts. We report the first demonstration of direct, catalytic oxidation of methane into methanol with molecular oxygen over copper-exchanged zeolites at low reaction temperatures (483 – 498 K). Reaction kinetics studies show sustained catalytic activity and high selectivity for a variety of commercially available zeolite topologies under mild conditions (<b>e.</b> g., <b>483</b> K and atmospheric pressure). Transient and steady state measurements with isotopically labeled molecules confirm catalytic turnover. The catalytic rates and apparent activation energies are affected by the zeolite topology, with caged-based zeolites (e. g., Cu-SSZ- 13) showing the highest rates. Although the reaction rates are low, the discovery of catalytic sites in copper-exchanged zeolites will accelerate the development of strategies to directly oxidize methane into methanol under mild conditions.

40|$|In {{attempt to}} prevent graft failure, the tissue-regeneration field offered the porous {{vascular}} scaffolds as promising {{solution for the}} lack of endothelialization seen in the small-calibre synthetic vascular graft. Another cause of graft failure was reported to be the mechanical mismatch between the graft and the host vessel. This study concerned the investigation and optimization of structural designs of tissue-regenerative vascular grafts, comprising ingrowth permissible porous polyurethane (PPU) foam and knitted reinforcement wire mesh, with the aim of providing vascular prostheses that mimic arterial mechanics. A 3 D geometry of a knitted eight-loop wire mesh was imported into Abaqus CAEÂ® 6. 8 - 2 and assembled with a PPU tube geometry such that the wire mesh acted as external reinforcement (EX) or embedded reinforcement (EM) to the PPU tube. A 45 Â°-section assembly was meshed using 8 -node linear brick elements. Nitinol (NITI) and polyurethane (PU) material models were used for the knitted mesh. Material parameters obtained in experimental tests were implemented in hyperfoam (PPU), shape memory alloy (NITI) and linear elastic (PU) constitutive models. The luminal grafts surfaces were subjected to uniformly distributed pressure load ramping from 0 to 200 mmHg. Models were compared in terms of predicted maximum stress and strain, wall compression, strain energy, radial displacement and compliance. The predicted radial compliance ranged between 1. 2 and 15. 6 %/ 100 mmHg in the reinforced grafts, compared to 106. 4 and 65. 1 %/ 100 mmHg for the non-reinforced grafts. The maximum stress in the Nitinol remained safe at 33 % of stress associated with start of austenite-martensite phase transformation (i. <b>e.</b> <b>483</b> MPa).

Recent studies have provided {{insight into the}} mode by which EHD 1 -associated tubular membranes are generated and the mechanisms by which EHD 1 functions. Despite these advances, the physiological function of these striking EHD 1 -associated tubular membranes remains unknown. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated that the Eps 15 homology (EH) domain of EHD 1 binds to phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate.

Indeed, an EHD 1 EH domain mutant (K <b>483</b> <b>E)</b> that associates exclusively with punctate membranes displayed decreased binding to phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate and other phosphoinositides. Moreover, we provide evidence that although the tubular membranes to which EHD 1 associates may be stabilized and/or enhanced by EHD 1 expression, these membranes are, at least in part, pre-existing structures.

The tool used for analysis was a “map” (or classification system) for labwork tasks. Whilst some differences are noted between the science subjects and between educational levels, the dominant impression from this analysis is of similarity across educational levels, science subjects and countries.

We describe the clinical case and molecular characterization of an adolescent with metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma (PDC). Given the rarity and poor prognosis associated with PDC in children, we utilized genomic analysis and preclinical models to validate oncogenic drivers and identify molecular vulnerabilities. Methods We utilized whole exome sequencing (WES) and transcriptome analysis to identify germline and somatic alterations in the patient’s tumor. In silico and {{in vitro studies}} {{were used to determine}} the functional consequences of genomic alterations. Primary tumor was used to generate a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model, which was used for in vivo assessment of predicted therapeutic options. Results WES revealed a novel germline frameshift variant (p. E 1554 fs) in APC, establishing a diagnosis of Gardner syndrome, along with a somatic nonsense (p. R 790 *) APC mutation in the tumor. Somatic mutations in TP 53, MAX, BRAF, ROS 1, and RPTOR were also identified and transcriptome and immunohistochemical analyses suggested hyperactivation of the Wnt/ß-catenin and AKT/mTOR pathways. In silico and biochemical assays demonstrated that the MAX p. R 60 Q and BRAF p.

40|$|Sulfate-driven {{anaerobic}} oxidation {{of methane}} (SO 4 -AOM) in marine sediments commonly {{leads to the}} precipitation of pyrite. It is, however, frequently challenging to unequivocally unravel {{the entire history of}} pyritization, because of the common coexistence of SO 4 -AOM derived pyrite with pyrite resulting from organiclastic sulfate reduction (OSR). To better understand how SO 4 -AOM affects pyritization in methane-bearing sediments and how this can be identified, we applied secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) to analyze the sulfur isotope composition (d 34 S) of authigenic pyrite in addition to sulfur isotope measurements of bulk sulfide and hand-picked pyrite aggregates from the two seafloor sites, HS 148 and HS 217, in the Shenhu seepage area, South China Sea. Authigenic, mostly tubular pyrite aggregates from these sites consist of three types of pyrite: framboids, zoned aggregates with radial overgrowths surrounding a framboidal core, and euhedral pyrite crystals. Framboids with low SIMS d 34 S values (as low as - 41. 6 per mil at HS 148, and - 38. 8 per mil at HS 217) are dispersed throughout the cores, but are especially abundant in the shallow part of the sedimentary column (i. <b>e.</b> above <b>483</b> cmbsf in HS 148; above 670 cmbsf in HS 217). These patterns are interpreted to reflect the dominance of OSR during early diagenetic processes in the shallow sediments. With increasing depth, both d 34 S values of bulk sulfide minerals and hand-picked pyrite aggregates increase sharply at 483 cmbsf in core HS 148, and at 700 cmbsf in core HS 217, respectively. Radial pyrite overgrowths and euhedral crystals become abundant at depth typified by high d 34 S values for hand-picked pyrite. Moreover, SIMS analysis reveals an extreme variability of d 34 S values for the three pyrite types on a small scale in these zones. Besides some moderately 34 S enriched framboids, most of the overgrowths and euhedral crystals display extremely high SIMS d 34 S values (as high as + 114. 8 per mil at HS 148, and + 74. 3 per mil at HS 217), representing the heaviest stable sulfur isotope composition of pyrite ever reported {{to the best of our}} knowledge. Such an abrupt and extreme increase in d 34 Spyrite values with depth is best explained by an enrichment of 34 S in the pool of dissolved sulfide caused by SO 4 -AOM in the sulfate methane transition zone (SMTZ). The increase in d 34 S values from framboidal cores to overgrowth layers and euhedral crystals indicates continuous, and finally near to complete exhaustion of dissolved sulfate at the SMTZ following a Rayleigh distillation process. SO 4 -AOM allowed for subsequent growth of later stage pyrite over the initial framboids, part of which formed earlier and at shallower depth by OSR. The combination of a detailed petrographic study of authigenic pyrite with SIMS analysis of stable sulfur isotopes in organic-rich strata proves to be a powerful tool for reconstructing the dynamics of sulfur cycling in modern and, potentially, ancient sedimentary sequences...|$|R

Another 60 adults aged from 21 to 71 years were recruited for the crossvalidation group (BMI= 24. 5 +/- 4. 0 kg/m(2), ranged from 17. 1 to 34. 6 kg/m(2)). We examined (1) the prediction of IFM based on {{a small number of}} skinfold thicknesses; (2) the prediction of VFA(L 4 - 5) using IFM and (3) the application of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) measurement. VFA(L 4 - 5) was measured by computed tomography (reference value). Total fat mass was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and single-frequency BIA with 8 -point tactile electrodes. RESULTS: Three skinfolds at the abdomen, side chest and suprailiac were selected to estimate IFM. From IFM estimated using these three skinfolds, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), sex and age, about 75 % of the variance of VFA(L 4 - 5) could be explained (Eq(VFA) 1 : R= 863, R(2) = 0. 745, standard error of estimate (s. e. <b>e.)</b> = 20. <b>483</b> cm(2)). When substituting IFM based on BIA measurement (IFM(BIA)) into Eq(VFA) 1, there were no significant mean differences from the reference in both equations, and high correlations were found (r= 0. 860, s. e. e. = 20. 902 cm(2)), although a significant mean difference in total fat mass was found between DXA and BIA measurements. The prediction equation using IFM(BIA) (Eq(VFA) 2) could have prediction accuracy comparable with that of Eq(VFA) 1 (Eq(VFA) 2 : R= 879, R(2) = 0. 773, s. e. e. = 20. 324 cm(2)). Furthermore, when applying these equations to the crossvalidation group, there were cross-validity in both equations.

Affected persons can seek relief from the federal firearms disability by invoking procedures established in 18 USC Sec. 925 (c) under the Dept of Treasury, Director of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (“ATF”). Beginning in 1992, Congress has enacted provisions annually in the ATF’s appropriations laws that ban it from investigating or acting upon Sec. 925 (c) applications from individuals. Section 925 (c) contains provisions for judicial review of agency determinations under the relief program.
