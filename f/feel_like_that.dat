She also explained why she named the album for the song, commenting, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> song {{has a lot of}} meaning, and it also kind of was the start of what I wanted to base all the other songs around." [...] A Spanish-language version of the song titled [...] "Un Año Sin Lluvia" [...] was released through the iTunes Store on October 26, 2010.|$|E

It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established {{that she would have}} an abortion in this circumstance." [...] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because [...] "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: [...] "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea that this woman would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [...] would have been hideous. [...] made sense for the character." ...|$|E
500|$|In April 2009, Sugababes {{travelled}} to the United States to work {{on their}} seventh studio album, Sweet 7. They signed a contract with Jay Z's record label, Roc Nation, resulting in working with high-profile produceers. [...] "Get Sexy", which was selected as the album's lead single, was written by Fred Fairbrass, Richard Fairbrass, Rob Manzoli, Philip Lawrence, Ari Levine, Bruno Mars and produced by the latter three under their stage name The Smeezingtons. Working with The Smeezingtons was described by group member Amelle Berrabah as an [...] "amazing" [...] and [...] "great opportunity". Berrabah also stated in an interview with Bang Showbiz that the song [...] "doesn't sound like anything we have ever done before". On 6 July 2009, Sugababes announced the release date of [...] "Get Sexy" [...] as 31 August 2009. The song premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 7 July 2009 in a show presented by Scott Mills. In an interview for Digital Spy, Buchanan said that the response to the song was great, saying: [...] "From the beginning there's been a real buzz about the track. It's had a great response from so many people, even if they say, 'Forget about the rest of them, this one I love'." [...] Later, on 27 September 2013, Keisha Buchanan said of the Bruno Mars penned song that, [...] "I just didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> was a representation of who we were as a band but we didn't, at that point, have a lot of say." [...] However, [...] "It was amazing working with Bruno, and we'd love to work with him in this line-up" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to Karofsky's newly revealed sexual orientation, {{other aspects of}} his personality have been explored. In [...] "The Sue Sylvester Shuffle", when the football team is forced {{to spend a week}} working with the glee club that Karofsky and other members have been bullying, the [...] "softer side" [...] of his personality is seen, especially when he's performing with the club. After the club's director surprises him with a compliment on his performing, Karofsky is the one who suggests that the team perform an extra musical number for the halftime show they are preparing for, though he comes up with a rationale that makes it sound like a necessity to keep up their social status rather than something he particularly wants to do. Adler said, [...] "I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> it did make him happy and, obviously, he has some natural abilities that Mr. Schuester was able to spot. I don't think he's ever allowed himself to do that ever in his life, to dance or learn a song, especially to do that in public. ...Doing that was such an obstacle to overcome." [...] In [...] "Furt" [...] and [...] "Born This Way", it is revealed that he had been kind, a cub scout, and an [...] "A" [...] student. However, his behavior had changed for the worse in the former episode before returning to the good in the latter. Although the anti-bullying club formed by Karofsky and Santana in [...] "Born This Way" [...] is created with ulterior motives in mind, Karofsky subsequently makes a tearful apology to Kurt in [...] "Prom Queen", and then insists that Kurt wait for his safety escort after the next class period.|$|E

2500|$|Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and its {{supporting}} tour {{marked the}} last appearance of Adrian Smith until {{he returned to}} the band in 1999. The guitarist left during the pre-production stages of the band's following album, 1990's No Prayer for the Dying, as he was unhappy with the more [...] "street-level" [...] direction the group were taking, professing that he [...] "thought we were heading in the right direction with the last two albums" [...] and that he [...] "thought we needed to keep going forward, and it just didn't <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the tour, {{the band}} {{revealed}} {{that they had}} scrapped two albums worth of songs recorded since Above the Noise. Fletcher said: [...] "After {{a certain amount of}} time, you <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> was where you were at, at a momentIf we released stuff we recorded three years ago, we wouldn't be 100 per cent behind it any more. We still love the songs but we'd be excited about doing new things." [...] The following day, they announced that they would finally begin recording new material in January 2017. In December 2016, Judd revealed that the McBusted-recorded song 'Getting It Out' would have appeared on the band's scrapped album.|$|E

[...] He was regularly being recognized and approached by fans. When interviewed for the Discovery Channel in July 2004, Larry said, “I just <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> I’m maybe slightly starting to fit in somewhere and slightly starting to be accepted.” [...] His friend Timothy White said: [...] "It was finally making sense to him – [...] all his turmoil, all his craziness...everything was just all coming together into this one moment of recognition that he was coming to..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pierre {{has since}} looked back on Go with mixed emotions; he later cited {{it as his}} {{personal}} least favorite album by the band. He remembered the band were [...] "burnt out and miserable" [...] while recording, noting that drummer Thaxton left the band a year later due to depression. He personally was struggling with dark thoughts as well: [...] " [...] I was thinking about death a lot and {{had a lot of}} back pain and was grumpy and it was winter. [...] A {{lot of people who were}} close to me died around that time and I just felt this strange floating sensation like I was sleepwalking through life. It wasn't bad or good, it was just weird and I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> somehow translated to that record." ...|$|E
2500|$|Salmond became {{active in}} the SNP {{when he joined the}} Federation of Student Nationalists at the University of St Andrews in 1973. His {{conversion}} is generally credited to his then girlfriend, Debbie Horton, an English student from London, who was secretary of the St Andrews University Labour club. After an argument in December 1973, she told him: [...] "If you <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that,</b> go and join the bloody SNP". The next day Salmond did. The following day he and a friend attended the sparsely populated AGM of the university branch of the Federation of Student Nationalists. Being the only two fully paid-up members of the SNP at the university, they were duly elected president and treasurer. Although a left-winger at the time he joined, Salmond had considerable doubts {{as to whether or not}} the Labour Government would legislate for a devolved Scottish Assembly.|$|E
2500|$|Dave Sitek of TV on the Radio {{hailed the}} group for their song [...] "Kiss Them for Me". Sitek stated: [...] "I've always {{tried to make a}} song that begins like [...] "Kiss Them for Me". I think songs like [...] "I Was a Lover" [...] or [...] "Wash the Day Away" [...] came from that element of {{surprise}} mode where all of a sudden this giant drum comes in and you're like, what the fuck?! That record was the first one where I was like, okay, even my friends're going to fall for this. I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> transition into that record was a relief for me. Really beautiful music was always considered too weird by the normal kids {{and that was the first}} example where I thought, we've got them, they're hooked! I watched people dance to that song, people who had never heard of any of the music that I listened to, they heard that music in a club and went crazy." ...|$|E

But when the next war comes, and European civilisation is wiped out, as it will be, and by no force more than that force, then do not let them lay blame on the old men. Let them remember that they, principally, or they alone, are responsible for the terrors that have fallen upon the earth.|$|E
2500|$|Game {{director}} Justin Richmond {{explained that}} the game feels more open than other Uncharted games mainly due to the great new character creation feature. [...] "We're not an open-world game, we're {{never going to be}} an open-world game but; we can try. It's still up in the air how much gameplay we're going to let you wander around. But we aim to let you just ride a thousand miles off into the middle of nowhere and still find action and adventure as you go." [...] Ultimately the feel we want to get is, yeah, your character is lost in the desert. So it needs to <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> We aim to make it feel open-world." [...] In regards to whether or not PlayStation Move would be supported in Uncharted 3, Naughty Dog explained that [...] "A great Move game is a game made around Move and we started Uncharted long before that. It would be very difficult for us to adjust it. We tried a couple of things but it wasn't making a lot of sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|U2 {{originally}} {{began the}} Innocence + Experience Tour {{with the intent}} to tour in two phases, one with material primarily taken from Songs of Innocence and one with material that would eventually be from its follow-up, Songs of Experience. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "By the time we finished the Innocence tour and came full circle to focus on the [...] album, it was clear we weren't {{going to be able to}} flip it really quickly into the Experience side of the material and put it right back out on tour." [...] When asked about plans to continue the Innocence + Experience Tour after the Joshua Tree Tour 2017, the Edge said, [...] "We <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> tour wasn't finished. So right now, we'd love to finish that tour. I would imagine it's gonna be with very similar production components... But we like that tour and that project wasn't completed.

Mike Patton recently sung on the Secret Chiefs 3 song [...] "La Chanson de Jacky" [...] in 2012 giving further speculation by fans on the chance of a reunion. Despite this, Trevor Dunn stated in a February 2013 interview with SF Weekly that there will be no Mr. Bungle reunion, saying, [...] "I've heard the faintest murmurings about it, but honestly I don't think anyone is interested. It's nothing personal, either. We all <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> band said what it needed to say. It would feel weird and awkward to play that music again. It would take a pant-load of money to make it happen, and honestly, I don't want to do it for that reason. I would prefer to let go of it, respectfully." [...] When asked about Mr. Bungle reuniting in an interview published in February 2014, Patton responded by saying, [...] "Who knows?

In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, {{she said she was}} [...] "surprised by the intensity and the fury" [...] that came from fans and she did not think [...] "anyone on the show expected such social outcry." [...] To Debnam-Carey, [...] "any attention we can draw to a movement like that is an amazing thing, and is a great thing to pursue and keep working towards." [...] She emphasized Lexa's death never came from a place of hate or negativity from the writers or Rothenberg, or anyone in the crew, and the death was purely a creative decision made due to her obligations to Fear the Walking Dead. [...] "I know obviously that it's hard when there are social issues going on and maybe they were dealt with in an insensitive way for some people," [...] stated Debnam-Carey. [...] "And I hate that people <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that.</b> That's really awful if people feel ostracized or targeted."

2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the Time You Read This, I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> article made those arguments." ...|$|E
