It's sometimes a nightmare to work with him in the studio because of the pride he puts into the smallest details. If he's not in the right mood or doesn't find the correct words we <b>get</b> <b>nothing</b> done. At times I've spent days in the studio counting seconds with nothing happening. It's the same way now, but I know in the end the result will be unique and powerful.|$|E

Dryden didn't lash {{out at the}} fans. [...] "I'm disappointed, but I can {{understand}} it. The fans wanted us to do real good, and they're frustrated we didn't. I didn't think I deserved to be booed. Tretiak frustrated us, but I guess I didn't frustrate them enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|Auction Spades: This variant {{combines}} Spades gameplay {{with the}} auction-based bidding of Contract Bridge. Each player must bid {{a minimum of}} 1 trick; by making the bid, they are committing their partnership to take the minimum 6 tricks plus the number bid. Subsequent bidders must raise the bid or pass; once they pass, they cannot bid further. Once all other players have passed, the winning partnership (declarers) must take a number of tricks equal to the winning bid plus 6 (so a winning bid of 2 commits the declarers to winning 8 tricks), while the defenders attempt to set them. If the declarers make contract, they get 10 points per bid trick; if they are set they <b>get</b> <b>nothing.</b> The defenders get 10 points per overtrick made by, or undertrick missed by, the declarers (if the declarers bid 2 and only make 6 tricks, the declarers <b>get</b> <b>nothing</b> and defenders get 20 points; if the declarers make 10 tricks, the declarers get 80 points but the defenders get 20 for the 2 unbid overtricks). Thus, the defenders {{have a choice of}} tactics; they can either set the declarers so they get no points, or may [...] "bag" [...] the declarers by forcing them to take overtricks so both sides get points.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, a [...] "successful" [...] salvage was {{one where}} {{at least some of}} the ship or cargo was saved, {{otherwise}} the principle of [...] "No Cure, No Pay" [...] meant that the salvor would <b>get</b> <b>nothing.</b> [...] In the 1970s, a number of marine casualties of single-skin-hull tankers led to serious oil spills. [...] Such casualties were unattractive to salvors, so the Lloyd's Open Form (LOF) made provision that a salvor who acts to try to prevent environmental damage will be paid, even if unsuccessful. [...] This Lloyd's initiative proved so advantageous that it was incorporated into the 1989 Convention.|$|E

2500|$|Thinking, however, {{is not so}} much a {{substitute}} for the earlier processes as a subsidiary addition to them. It only pays in certain cases, and intelligence may be shown also by discerning what they are and when it is wiser to act without thinking. [...] Philosophers, however, have very mistaken ideas about rational action. They tend to think that men ought to think all the time, and about all things. But if they did this they would <b>get</b> <b>nothing</b> done, and shorten their lives without enhancing their merriment. Also they utterly misconceive the nature of rational action. They represent it as consisting in the perpetual use of universal rules, whereas it consists rather in perceiving when a general rule must be set aside in order that conduct may be adapted to a particular case.|$|E
2500|$|The highly {{mixed results}} (along with similar {{results in the}} Dictator game) [...] {{have been taken to}} be both {{evidence}} for and against the so-called [...] "Homo economicus" [...] assumptions of rational, utility-maximizing, individual decisions. Since an individual who rejects a positive offer is choosing to <b>get</b> <b>nothing</b> rather than something, that individual must not be acting solely to maximize his economic gain, unless one incorporates economic applications of social, psychological, and methodological factors (such as the observer effect). Several {{attempts have been made to}} explain this behavior. Some suggest that individuals are maximizing their expected utility, but money does not translate directly into expected utility. Perhaps individuals get some psychological benefit from engaging in punishment or receive some psychological harm from accepting a low offer. [...] It could also be the case that the second player, by having the power to reject the offer, uses such power as leverage against the first player, thus motivating him to be fair.|$|E
2500|$|The album's booklet is twenty-four pages long, {{consisting}} of song lyrics and comics drawn by Zombie. Gene Colan and Dan Brereton, of Marvel Comics, contributed numerous drawings for the booklet. The booklet contains numerous images of ghosts, goblins, monsters, and other creatures. Numerous references to Lucifer and Satan are made throughout the pages, along {{with images of}} Sheri Moon and other near-nude women. Zombie had {{a replica of the}} robot from the film The Phantom Creeps (1939) created for the booklet. The replica was created by Wayne Toth, and stood ten feet tall. The creation is featured {{on the back of the}} album, as well as the single cover for [...] "Dragula". Zombie would continue to use it for numerous live performances and appearances, including the music video for his single [...] "Dead City Radio and the New Gods of Supertown" [...] (2013). Zombie said of the booklet, [...] "It’s a welcome relief from the less-is-more school of thought [...] I grew up in the heyday of cool record packaging. I would stare at the record for hours. Now, you open a record and you <b>get</b> <b>nothing.</b> I always feel cheated." [...] The disc itself is either white or yellow depending on the version, and features images of various monsters and ghouls also designed by Zombie.|$|E

What they took before 1947–48 constitutes plunder, and what they are doing now is a continuation of this plundering. By no means do we recognize their Green Line.

2500|$|The {{crossword puzzle}} fad {{received}} extensive attention, {{not all of}} it positive: In 1924, The New York Times complained of the [...] "sinful waste in the utterly futile finding of words the letters of which will fit into a prearranged pattern, more or less complex.

[...] A clergyman called the working of crossword puzzles [...] "the mark of a childish mentality" [...] and said, [...] "There is no use for persons to pretend that working one of the puzzles carries any intellectual value with it.". However, another wrote a complete [...] "Bible Cross-Word Puzzle Book". Also in 1925, Time Magazine noted that nine Manhattan dailies and fourteen other big newspapers were carrying crosswords, and quoted opposing views as to whether [...] "This crossword craze will positively end by June!" [...] or [...] "The crossword puzzle is here to stay!" [...] In 1925, The New York Times noted, with approval, a scathing critique of crosswords by The New Republic; but concluded that [...] "Fortunately, {{the question of whether the}} puzzles are beneficial or harmful is in no urgent need of an answer. The craze evidently is dying out fast and in a few months it will be forgotten." [...] and in 1929 declared, [...] "The cross-word puzzle, it seems, has gone the way of all fads...." [...] In 1930, a correspondent noted that [...] "Together with The Times of London, yours is the only journal of prominence that has never succumbed to the lure of the cross-word puzzle" [...] and said that [...] "The craze—the fad—stage has passed, but there are still people numbering it to the millions who look for their daily cross-word puzzle as regularly as for the weather predictions." [...] The New York Times, however, was not to publish a crossword puzzle until 1942; today, the Times puzzle is one of the most popular in the country.|$|E
