25|$|Dextromethorphan {{has been}} noted to slow the {{development}} of tolerance to opioids and exert additional analgesia by acting upon the NMDA receptors; some analgesics such as methadone and <b>ketobemidone</b> and perhaps piritramide have intrinsic NMDA action.|$|E
25|$|Several opioids, {{particularly}} methadone and <b>ketobemidone,</b> possess NMDA antagonism {{in addition}} to their µ-opioid agonist properties. Methadone does so because it is a racemic mixture; only the l-isomer is a potent µ-opioid agonist. The d-isomer does not have opioid agonist action and acts as an NMDA antagonist; d-methadone is analgesic in experimental models of chronic pain. Clinical studies are in progress to test the efficacy of d-methadone in neuropathic pain syndromes.|$|E
25|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and sold under the brand name Demerol among others, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. Pethidine is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (<b>ketobemidone,</b> etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{morphine}} can be countered with opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone; {{the development of}} tolerance to morphine may be inhibited by NMDA antagonists such as ketamine or dextromethorphan. The rotation of morphine with chemically dissimilar opioids in the long-term treatment of pain will slow down the growth of tolerance in the longer run, particularly agents known to have significantly incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine such as levorphanol, <b>ketobemidone,</b> piritramide, and methadone and its derivatives; all of these drugs also have NMDA antagonist properties. It is believed that the strong opioid with the most incomplete cross-tolerance with morphine is either methadone or dextromoramide.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{skeletal}} muscle relaxants {{of that type}} used around the world come {{from a number of}} drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen, [...] Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax {{skeletal muscle}}s include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some <b>ketobemidone,</b> piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic.|$|E
50|$|Pfizer {{manufactures}} <b>ketobemidone</b> {{under the}} tradenames Ketogan and Ketorax. It is available as tablets, suppositories, and injection fluid. A sustained release formulation exists, sold as Ketodur, {{in some countries}} containing 10 or 25 mg <b>ketobemidone.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Ketobemidone</b> (trade names Cliradon, Ketogan, Ketodur, Cymidon, Ketorax, and others) is a {{powerful}} opioid analgesic. Its effectiveness against pain {{is in the same}} range as morphine, and it also has some NMDA-antagonist properties imparted by its metabolite norketobemidone. This makes it useful for some types of pain that don't respond well to other opioids. The most commonly cited equalisation ratio for analgesic doses is 25 mg of oral <b>ketobemidone</b> hydrobromide to 60 mg of morphine hydrochloride or sulphate and about 8 mg of <b>ketobemidone</b> by injection and 10 mg of morphine.|$|E
50|$|Several {{synthetic}} opioids function additionally as NMDAR-antagonists, such as pethidine, methadone, dextropropoxyphene, tramadol and <b>ketobemidone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketobemidone</b> {{is mainly}} metabolized by {{conjugation}} of the phenolic hydroxyl group, and by N-demethylation. Only about 13-24% is excreted unchanged after intravenous administration.|$|E
50|$|Analgesia after 5-10 mg orally or 5-7.5 mg {{intravenously}} lasts 3-5 hours. <b>Ketobemidone</b> is {{also available}} in preparations with a spasmolytic, which can improve the analgesia.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{a strong}} {{vesicant}} nature of bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine {{there are many other}} routes developed for obtaining <b>ketobemidone.</b> A route depicted below lays through first alkylating the same (3-methoxyphenyl)acetonitrile with 2-chloro-N,N-dimethylethylamine or 2-chloro-N-benzyl-N-methylethylamine. Next, those amines are alkylated once again using a mixed 1-bromo-2-chloroethane, thus completing the piperidine ring and obtaining a quaternary ammonium salt, which can be dequaternized using thiophenol salt (for N,N-dimethylammonium) or catalytic hydrogenation (for both compounds) to a common 4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4-cyano-1-methyl-pyperidine. The later yields <b>ketobemidone</b> after Grignard reaction with ethylmagnesium bromide and ether cleavage.|$|E
50|$|Experiments on former addicts {{indicated}} {{it was more}} addictive than other opioids, so in 1954 the Economic and Social Council took a resolution urging governments to stop manufacture and use of <b>ketobemidone.</b> This result was not in agreement with clinical observations, and another study in 1958 did not find it more addictive than morphine. That study noticed that while for morphine the dose for euphoria {{is the same as}} that for analgesia, for <b>ketobemidone</b> the analgesic dose was well below the euphoric dose.Ketobemidone is mostly used in the Scandinavian countries, with Denmark topping the statistics.|$|E
5000|$|... 4-Phenylpiperidine is {{the base}} {{structure}} {{for a variety}} of opioids, such as pethidine (meperidine), <b>ketobemidone,</b> alvimopan, loperamide, and diphenoxylate. Other pharmaceutical drugs derived from 4-phenylpiperdine include haloperidol, ropitoin, vesamicol, enefexine, and Altapizone.|$|E
50|$|Presumably acetoxyketobemidone {{produces}} similar {{effects to}} <b>ketobemidone</b> and other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression {{which may be}} harmful or fatal.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketobemidone</b> is 1-methyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-4-propionylpiperidine. It {{is usually}} {{available}} as the hydrochloride, {{which is a}} white powder. It is synthesized by alkylating (3-methoxyphenyl)acetonitrile with bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine, followed by reaction with ethylmagnesiumbromide, and finally O-demethylation with hydrobromic acid.|$|E
50|$|Dextromethorphan {{has been}} noted to slow the {{development}} of tolerance to opioids and exert additional analgesia by acting upon the NMDA receptors; some analgesics such as methadone and <b>ketobemidone</b> and perhaps piritramide have intrinsic NMDA action.|$|E
50|$|Methylketobemidone is {{so named}} {{because it is the}} methyl ketone {{analogue}} of bemidone (hydroxypethidine). The more commonly used ethyl ketone ("ethylketobemidone") is simply called <b>ketobemidone,</b> as it is the only drug of this family to have been marketed.|$|E
50|$|Hydroxypethidine (Bemidone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} analogue of pethidine (meperidine). Hydroxypethidine is significantly less potent than meperidine as an analgesic, (0.3x meperidine in potency) although it also has NMDA antagonist properties like its close relative <b>ketobemidone.</b>|$|E
50|$|JDTic is a selective, long-acting ("inactivating") {{antagonist}} of the κ-opioid receptor (KOR). JDTic is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative, distantly related structurally to analgesics such as pethidine and <b>ketobemidone,</b> {{and more}} closely to the MOR antagonist alvimopan. In addition, it is structurally distinct from other KOR antagonists such as norbinaltorphimine.|$|E
5000|$|The UN {{reported}} {{shortly after}} the beginning of marketing of <b>ketobemidone</b> that it was [...] "nine times more active" [...] than methadone, presumably as a euphoriant, and was thus labelled as extra-dangerous along with dextromoramide ("three times more active than heroin") and several other synthetics about the same time, as expanded upon below.|$|E
5000|$|Methylketobemidone is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{that is an}} analogue of <b>ketobemidone.</b> It {{was developed in the}} 1950s during research into analogues of pethidine and was assessed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime but was not included on the list of drugs under international control, probably because it was not used in medicine or widely available.|$|E
50|$|Several opioids, {{particularly}} methadone and <b>ketobemidone,</b> possess NMDA antagonism {{in addition}} to their µ-opioid agonist properties. Methadone does so because it is a racemic mixture; only the l-isomer is a potent µ-opioid agonist.

Clinical studies are in progress to test the efficacy of d-methadone in neuropathic pain syndromes.|$|E
5000|$|The Commentary {{notes that}} [...] "Whether the {{prohibition}} of drugs in Schedule IV (cannabis and cannabis resin, desomorphine, heroin, <b>ketobemidone)</b> should be mandatory or only recommended was a controversial question at the Plenipotentiary Conference." [...] The provision adopted represents [...] "a compromise which leaves prohibition to the judgement, though theoretically not to the discretion, of each Party." [...] The Parties are required to act in good faith in making this decision, or else {{they will be in}} violation of the treaty.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ketobemidone</b> {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1942 by Eisleb and colleagues, at the laboratory of I.G. Farbenindustrie at Hoechst during the Second World War. The first study {{of it in}} humans was published in 1946, and it was introduced in clinical medicine shortly after. It was not in clinical use in the United States when the Controlled Substances Act 1970 was promulgated and was assigned to Schedule I with an ACSCN of 9628. As of 2013, no annual manufacturing quota was assigned by the DEA.|$|E
5000|$|Pethidine, {{also known}} as {{meperidine}} and Demerol, is a synthetic opioid pain medication of the phenylpiperidine class. Synthesized in 1939 as a potential anticholinergic agent by the German chemist Otto Eisleb, its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann while working for IG Farben, Germany. [...] Pethidine was the first wholly synthetic opioid developed and is the prototype of a large family of analgesics including the pethidine 4-phenylpiperidines (pethidine, piminodine, anileridine and others), the prodines (alphaprodine, MPPP, etc.), bemidones (<b>ketobemidone,</b> etc.) and others more distant, including diphenoxylate and analogues.|$|E
5000|$|Dextromoramide was {{singled out}} along with <b>ketobemidone</b> {{and several other}} {{synthetics}} by the United Nations and European Union as being [...] "extra-dangerous" [...] in the early 1960s, with dextromoramide being alleged to be three times more euphoric than heroin at equianalgesic doses, though this did little to stem production {{in the first half}} of the decade. The development of the moramides and the coming to fruition of work on piritramide were two of the events that precipitated the 1961 update to the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs, as cited by Dr Shulgin in Controlled Substances and various monographs.|$|E

50|$|Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{of the open}} chain class (methadone and relatives) invented in Germany by Hoechst in 1947. It {{is one of a}} handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or (like phenazocine and bezitramide) in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are <b>ketobemidone</b> (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil).|$|E
5000|$|The {{interaction}} of carisoprodol with essentially all opioids, and other centrally acting analgesics, but especially [...] {{those of the}} codeine-derived subgroup of the semisynthetic class (codeine, ethylmorphine, dihydrocodeine, hydrocodone, oxycodone, nicocodeine, benzylmorphine, the various acetylated codeine derivatives including acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydroisocodeine, nicodicodeine and others) [...] which allows {{the use of a}} smaller dose of the opioid to have a given effect , is useful in general and especially where skeletal muscle injury and/or spasm is {{a large part of the}} problem. The potentiation effect is also useful in other pain situations and is also especially useful with opioids of the open-chain class, such as methadone, levomethadone, <b>ketobemidone,</b> phenadoxone and others. In recreational drug users, deaths have resulted from carelessly combining overdoses of hydrocodone and carisoprodol. Another danger of misuse of carisoprodol and opiates is the potential to aspirate while unconscious.|$|E
50|$|Relative to morphine, {{levorphanol}} lacks complete cross-tolerance and possesses greater intrinsic {{activity at}} the MOR. The duration of action is generally long compared to other comparable analgesics and varies from 4 hours {{to as much as}} 15 hours. For this reason levorphanol is useful in palliation of chronic pain and similar conditions. Levorphanol has an oral to parenteral effectiveness ratio of 2:1, one of the most favorable of the strong narcotics. Its antagonism of the NMDA receptor, {{similar to those of the}} phenylheptylamine open-chain opioids such as methadone or the phenylpiperidine <b>ketobemidone,</b> make levorphanol useful for types of pain that other analgesics may not be as effective against, such as neuropathic pain. Levorphanol's exceptionally high analgesic efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain is also conferred by its action on serotonin and norepinephrine transporters, similar to the opioids tramadol and tapentadol, and mutually complements the analgesic effect of its NMDA receptor antagonism.|$|E
5000|$|Morphine is {{the gold}} {{standard}} to which all narcotics are compared. Semi-synthetic derivatives of morphine such as hydromorphone (Dilaudid), oxymorphone (Numorphan, Opana), nicomorphine (Vilan), hydromorphinol and others vary in such ways as duration of action, side effect profile and milligramme potency. Fentanyl has the benefit of less histamine release and thus fewer side effects. It can also be administered via transdermal patch which is convenient for chronic pain management. In addition to the intrathecal patch and injectable Sublimaze, the FDA has approved various immediate release fentanyl products for breakthrough cancer pain (Actiq/OTFC/Fentora/Onsolis/Subsys/Lazanda/Abstral). Oxycodone is used across the Americas and Europe for relief of serious chronic pain; its main slow-release formula is known as OxyContin, and short-acting tablets, capsules, syrups and ampules are available making it suitable for acute intractable pain or breakthrough pain. Diamorphine, methadone and buprenorphine are used less frequently. Pethidine, known in North America as meperidine, is not recommended [...] for pain management due to its low potency, short duration of action, and toxicity associated with repeated use. Pentazocine, dextromoramide and dipipanone are also not recommended in new patients except for acute pain where other analgesics are not tolerated or are inappropriate, for pharmacological and misuse-related reasons. In some countries potent synthetics such as piritramide and <b>ketobemidone</b> are used for severe pain, and tapentadol is a newer agent introduced in the last decade.|$|E
40|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} (ESI) {{mass spectrometry}} (MS) {{in combination with}} liquid chromatography (LC) is an excellent tool for the identification of drug metabolites. Utilizing this hyphenated technique in combination with proper sample pretreatment, the metabolic pathways of the analgesic drug <b>ketobemidone</b> were investigated in human urine and rat microdialysate from blood and brain. Two novel phase I metabolites (<b>ketobemidone</b> N-oxide and meta-hydroxymethoxyketobemidone) and three novel phase II metabolites (glucuronic acid conjugates of <b>ketobemidone,</b> norketobemidone and hydroxymethoxyketobemidone) were identified in human urine. Further, norketobemidone and <b>ketobemidone</b> N-oxide were identified in rat microdialysate from brain after regional distribution of <b>ketobemidone</b> in striatum. This indicates that the brain itself has the possibility to metabolize <b>ketobemidone.</b> Synthetic <b>ketobemidone</b> metabolites were used for comparison of retention times and tandem MS spectra with the possible metabolites recovered from the biological samples. The conjugated metabolites were identified by accurate mass measurements and tandem MS spectra of the aglycones. The accuracy of the estimated masses was better than 2. 1 ppm for {{two out of three}} conjugates in presence of internal standard. On-line micro-SPE was successfully used for trapping and desalting of the microdialysates. The small SPE pre-column made it possible to inject approximately 100 times more sample on the analytical column compared to injection without pre-column. Selective trapping was demonstrated for the polar catechol amine metabolite, dihydroxyketobemidone, which forms covalent complexes with phenylboronic acid (PBA). A fluorinated silica type stationary phase was the only column out of several tested that was able to separate <b>ketobemidone</b> and all relevant phase I metabolites. Liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry are independently valuable tools in the field of analytical pharmaceutical chemistry. The present study showed that the combination of LC-MS, with its excellent selectivity and sensitivity, offers an outstanding tool in the qualitative analysis of drugs and metabolites in biological fluids...|$|E
