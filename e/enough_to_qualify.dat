5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because {{they are unlikely to}} be declining fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> for listing in a more threatened category. When last assessed in 2007, the population trend was stable.|$|E
5|$|Kim Collins, {{the only}} man from St. Kitts and Nevis to compete in an {{individual}} event, competed in both the 100 m sprint and the 4 × 100 m relay {{at the age of}} 20. He finished the first heat of the 100 m sprint in third place with a time of 10.27, which was fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> him for the quarterfinals. Collins ran a little slower in the second heat—finishing with a time of 10.34—which was not sufficient to qualify for the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|The Saturn {{version of}} Silver Star Story was well {{received}} in Japan, with Weekly Sega Saturn Magazine recognizing {{it as one}} of the most memorable gaming experiences of 1997. The PlayStation version received a 7 out of 10 score from Hyper PlayStation magazine, remarking that although it contained lower quality visual effects and movie playback than the previous Saturn releases, it still remained a solid role-playing game. It sold <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> for Sony's PlayStation the Best distinction, and was subsequently re-released in Japan in April 1999 at a budget price.|$|E

5|$|Bremner {{was well}} {{established}} in the Scotland set-up, winning three under-23 caps, before he made his debut for Scotland in a 0–0 draw with Spain at Hampden Park. He went on to feature in qualifying games for the 1966 FIFA World Cup, but defeats to Poland and Italy left Scotland second in the Group, which was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify.</b> He also played in friendlies against Brazil and Portugal, and received a black eye from Pelé's elbow in a clash during a high ball; despite this being an accident it still demonstrated to Bremner how {{he had failed to}} intimidate Pelé as he had done to many other great players of the day.|$|E
5|$|Entering 2008, the Bulls {{sought to}} build off of their 2007 season, where {{they shared the}} MAC East {{championship}} but did {{not appear in the}} championship game due to a 31–28 loss to fellow division co-champion Miami (Ohio). Their 5–7 final record, while not good <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> for a bowl game, was still the best by a Buffalo team since they had moved up to Division I-A in 1999. With 10 starters returning on offense and eight on defense, the 2008 team was predicted to be perhaps the most talented team in Bulls history; however, due to their challenging schedule, their final record was predicted to be no better than 3–9.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, the Riding for the Disabled Association Singapore (RDA) invited Tan to {{join the}} Singapore team for the World Para Dressage Championships at Hartpury College in Hartpury, Gloucester, in England in July that year. At this event, her first {{international}} competition, she did well <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> for the 2008 Paralympic Games. In September 2008, at the Hong Kong Olympic Equestrian Centre at Sha Tin, she achieved bronze medals in the Individual Championship and Individual Freestyle Tests (class Ia). These were Singapore's first Paralympic medals and Asia's first equestrian medals at the Paralympic Games. Tan was conferred the Pingat Bakti Masyarakat (Public Service Medal) by the President of Singapore at a ceremony at the Istana Singapore on 20 September 2008.|$|E

5|$|Kim Collins {{competed in}} his fifth {{consecutive}} Olympic Games, {{and was the}} oldest sprinter at these Games. While most sprinters peak in their 20s, Collins set his personal record after reaching the age of 40, {{and became the first}} individual to run a sub-10 second 100m dash in the process. He ran a 9.93 100m dash, which was fast <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> for Rio. He competed in both the 100m sprint and 4 × 100m relay. Collins was the only St. Kitts and Nevis athlete to make it out of the first round. He finished his heat with a time of 10.18 and fourth place. He improved his time in the semifinals, finishing with a time of 10.12. This put him in sixth place and he did not advance to the finals.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} round at the World Championships, Sacramone {{qualified for the}} event finals on floor and vault {{and contributed to the}} top-qualifying position of the American team. She also posted a score on beam that would have been high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> her to the beam final. However, due to an International Federation of Gymnastics rule allowing only two athletes per country to participate in each event final, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal, because teammates Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her. In the team final, she competed on vault, beam and floor, earning scores of 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325, respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone gathered the team for a pep talk to refocus them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall, which was good enough to secure the gold medal ahead of China and Romania.|$|E
5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify.</b> This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E

5|$|The 2011 Copa Centroamericana, the {{new name}} of the reorganized UNCAF Nations Cup, used the same two–round system as the {{previous}} tournament, with a round–robin group stage in the first round, followed by a knockout style competition for the remaining four teams. El Salvador was drawn into a group with Belize, Nicaragua, and Panama. La Selecta defeated Nicaragua 2–0, Belize 5–2, and lost 2–0 against Panama, which was enough to let them advance from the group in second place. In the semifinals they lost to Honduras, again by a 2–0 score. In the third place match, they faced Panama again, losing in a penalty shootout 4–5 after a 0–0 draw. This performance was <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> El Salvador for the 2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup. The team was coached by José Luis Rugamas. Forward Rafael Burgos jointly received the Golden Boot with Costa Rica's Marco Ureña three goals.|$|E
5|$|In June 1997, {{two months}} before the Pan Pacific Championships, Thorpe {{required}} an appendix operation, which caused him to miss two weeks of training. Upon reaching Japan, Thorpe placed fourth in his heat of the 200m freestyle with a new personal best time of 1min 51.46s. Thorpe's time was not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>qualify</b> for the final, but earned him selection in the 4×200m freestyle relay team. Along with teammates Michael Klim, Ian van der Wal and Hackett, Thorpe claimed silver, making him the youngest ever Pan Pacific medalist. In his first individual final at international level, Thorpe was fifth at the 300m mark, but fought back to claim silver in the 400m freestyle behind Hackett in a time of 3min 49.64s. His finishing burst was to become a trademark, and his time would have been enough to win silver at the Atlanta Olympics. In October 1997, a few days before his fifteenth birthday, Thorpe competed in qualifying trials in Brisbane for the 1998 World Aquatics Championships in Perth. Thorpe gained selection for the world championships by finishing fourth and second in the 200m and 400m freestyle respectively. He set new personal bests in both events.|$|E
