5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>law).</b> Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point of psychological and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|Druitt rented legal {{chambers}} at 9 King's Bench Walk in the Inner Temple. In {{the late}} Victorian era only the wealthy could afford legal action, {{and only one}} in eight qualified barristers {{was able to make}} a living <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b> While some of Druitt's biographers claim his practice did not flourish, others suppose that it provided him with a relatively substantial income {{on the basis of his}} costly lease of chambers and the value of his estate at death. He is listed in the Law List of 1886 as active in the Western Circuit and Winchester Sessions, and for 1887 in the Western Circuit and Hampshire, Portsmouth and Southampton Assizes.|$|E

5|$|The Law Society of England and Wales persuaded Coopers & Lybrand {{to include}} an {{alternate}} reform proposal in their report, and after pressure <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law</b> Society, {{and several of the}} larger regional societies, the alternate proposal was used. This was far weaker than the original proposal, and kept the responsibility of regulating the solicitors' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required {{that the majority of the}} people on regulatory committees be lay people (not solicitors). The events surrounding this scandal have been directly linked to the reforms pushed through in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which created an independent disciplinary body for solicitors.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, Lundgren starred {{opposite}} Kristian Alfonso and George Segal in Joshua Tree, {{directed by}} Academy Award and BAFTA-winning stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong. Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who {{has turned to}} hauling exotic stolen cars with his friend Eddie Turner (Ken Foree). One day he is framed by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) {{for the murder of}} a highway patrolman, also killing his friend Eddie. Santee is sent to prison after recovering in a prison hospital, but escapes during transfer and takes a female hostage named Rita Marrick (Alfonso) at a gas station, not suspecting that she's a cop. On the run <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> involving exotic cars and desert scenery, Santee must prove his innocence and prove Severance guilty of being involved in the car ring and for murder.

5|$|Mitt Romney {{wanted to}} pursue a {{business}} career, but his father advised him that a law degree would be valuable to his career even if he never practiced law. As a result, he enrolled in the recently created four-year joint Juris Doctor/Master of Business Administration program coordinated between Harvard Law School and Harvard Business School. He readily adapted to the business school's pragmatic, data-driven case study method of teaching. Living in a Belmont, Massachusetts house with Ann and their two children, his social experience differed from most of his classmates'. He was nonideological and did not involve himself in the political issues of the day. He graduated in 1975 cum laude <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> school, in the top third of that class, and was named a Baker Scholar for graduating {{in the top five}} percent of his business school class.|$|E
5|$|On June 23, 1972, Title IX {{was enacted}} and had {{tremendous}} repercussions for the women's rights movement. Title IX prevented organizations from excluding members based on sex. Although social fraternities were exempt <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>law,</b> Kappa Kappa Psi, as a recognition society, fell under its purview. Rutgers University's {{board of trustees}} decided that Rutgers {{should serve as a}} model for the rest of the United States in Title IX implementation and mandated that all organizations on campus become coeducational or face disciplinary actions. The men of the Alpha Phi chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi regarded this issue as minor given the ongoing Vietnam War. With dwindling numbers, Alpha Phi looked to the new women members of the Rutgers band as potential members. The national constitution of Kappa Kappa Psi prohibited women from holding membership, so the Alpha Phi chapter explored the possibility of establishing a chapter of Tau Beta Sigma. This was unrealistic, as the undergraduate college for women prohibited the formation of or membership in any sorority.|$|E

BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the town square, Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain.

When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess (Maria Bamford) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.|$|E

5|$|The gospel Epiphanius {{attributed}} to the Ebionites is a valuable source of information that provides modern scholars with insights into the distinctive characteristics of a vanished branch of Jewish Christianity. However, scholars disagree on whether the information contained within the seven fragments preserved by Epiphanius accurately reflects {{the traditions of the}} second-century Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus, or if their belief system changed, perhaps greatly, over a span of 200 years compared to this early group. The Ebionites known to Irenaeus (first mentioned in Adversus Haereses 1.26.2, written around 185) and other Church Fathers prior to Epiphanius were described as a Jewish sect that regarded Jesus as the Messiah but not as divine. They insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites and they used only the Jewish–Christian gospel. The Ebionites rejected the epistles of Paul of Tarsus, whom they regarded as an apostate <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Law.</b>|$|E
