The increasing ownership of electric vehicles, in-home {{solar and wind}} generation, and wider penetration of renewable energies onto the power grid has created a need for grid-based energy storage to provide energy-neutral services. These services include frequency regulation, which requires short response-times, high power ramping capabilities, and several charge cycles {{over the course of}} one day; and diurnal load-/generation-following services to offset the inherent mismatch between renewable generation and the power grid's load profile, which requires low self-discharge so that a reasonable efficiency is obtained over a 24 hour storage interval. To realize the maximum benefits of energy storage, the technology should be modular and have minimum geographic constraints, so that it is easily scalable according to local demands. Furthermore, the technology must be economically viable to participate in the energy markets. There is currently no storage technology that is able to simultaneously meet all of these needs. This dissertation focuses on developing a new energy storage device based on flywheel technology to meet these needs. It is shown that the bearingless ac <b>homopolar</b> <b>machine</b> can be used to overcome key obstacles in flywheel technology, namely: unacceptable self-discharge and overall system cost and complexity. Bearingless machines combine the functionality of a magnetic bearing and a motor/generator into a single electromechanical device. Design of these machines is particularly challenging due to cross-coupling effects and trade-offs between motor and magnetic bearing capabilities. The bearingless ac <b>homopolar</b> <b>machine</b> adds to these design challenges due to its 3 D flux paths requiring computationally expensive 3 D finite element analysis. At the time this dissertation was started, bearingless ac homopolar machines were a highly immature technology. This dissertation advances the state-of-the-art of these machines through research contributions in the areas of magnetic modeling, winding design, control, and power-electronic drive implementation. While these contributions are oriented towards facilitating more optimal flywheel designs, they will also be useful in applying the bearingless ac <b>homopolar</b> <b>machine</b> in other applications. Example designs are considered through finite element analysis and experimental validation is provided from a proof-of-concept prototype that has been designed and constructed as a part of this dissertation...|$|E

Authors provide a suitable variation on a recent work “The Unipolar Dynamotor: A Genuine Relational Engine ” [3], where “relational” implies “absolutely relativistic”. The authors ’ view agrees with both Weber’s recognition in the 19 th century of the importance of relative motion in electromagnetic phenomena [4] and Einstein’s 1905 statement concerning electromagnetism [5]. The Faraday disk: a reversible engine The essential components of the <b>homopolar</b> <b>machine,</b> first conceived by Faraday in 1832, are shown in Figure 1. A conducting disk, free to rotate in the neighborhood of a permanent magnet, is attached {{to the end of a}} shaft. A closing wire provides a conducting path between two arbitrary points of the disk. Such a device exhibits reversible behavior. Fig. 1 Faraday’s setup magnet, disk and closing wire A radial current path of length L takes place in a region of the disk when direct current (dc) from an external source is injected into the closing wire.

In 2005 the General Atomics company received a contract {{for the creation of}} a large low speed superconducting homopolar motor for ship propulsion. Superconducting homopolar generators have been considered as pulsed power sources for laser weapon systems.

40|$|After a brief {{review of}} the general {{properties}} of superconductors, the difficulties encountered in employing superconducting wires in solenoids are described together with the measures it has been found necessary to take in order to construct coils with satisfactory performance. A comprehensive review of the attempts and proposals in the literature to employ superconductors in rotating energy converters and appraisal of each, is then given. The possibilities of utilizing superconducting winding in conventional types of rotating machines are then examined, and it is shown that probably only the d. c. <b>homopolar</b> <b>machine,</b> the synchronous machine and a toroidal reciprocating generator proposed by Harrowell are suitable for development with superconducting ·windings. The present state of development of superconducting d,c, homopolar machines is described, and the economic and market prospects for such machines assessed {{on the basis of the}} limited data available supplemented by reasonable assumptions. Design procedures for the Harrowell machine are propose, and from these some conclusions are drawn regarding its characteristics. The prospects for superconducting synchronous generators are examined for use in large power systems and shown to be promising, but for aircraft applications it is shown there is no case for mmachines with ratings below 1 MVA at 400 Hz. The inadequacies of existing theories of synchronous machines to cover superconducting types are examined and proposals are put forward to modify the conventional two-axis theory for the superconducting case including parameter evaluation. The experimental work reported covers the design, construction and testing of a. 400 Hz rotating armature synchronous generator, with a rating of 50 kVA initially, but capable of being extended to 100 kVA subsequently. ...|$|E

Since the early 20 th century, icebreakers have employed the flexibility and easy control of direct current (dc) motors {{to provide for}} ship operations that split ice with {{back and forth motion}} of the ship. More recently, cruise ships have employed diesel-electric propulsion systems {{to take advantage of the}} flexibility of diesel, as opposed to steam engines, and because the electric plant can also be used for hotel loads. Research vessels, ferries, tankers, and special purpose vessels have also taken advantage of increased flexibility and fuel efficiency with electric propulsion. Today, the U. S.

There are several different classes of motors that might be considered for use in ship propulsion, ranging from dc (commutator) motors through conventional induction and synchronous motors to permanent magnet synchronous machines, doubly fed machines and superconducting alternating current (ac) and acyclic <b>homopolar</b> <b>machines.</b> This review paper describes features of some of the major classes of motor that might be used in ship propulsion...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] The paper {{deals with}} the study related to {{integration}} of Flywheel Energy storage system (FESS) to an already available model of parallel hybrid vehicle with pretransmission torque coupling, i. e., replacing the conventional chemical battery with an equivalent mechanical battery. Advantages like high reliability, long cycle life, high energy storage capacity and deep discharge of an FESS can potentially enhance {{the performance of the}} hybrid vehicles. FESS employed for the analysis comprises an integrated flywheel <b>homopolar</b> inductor <b>machine</b> with High-frequency drive. The simulation results of an Electrically Peaking Hybrid (ELPH) are used as a base work in the present analysis. The ELPH model uses a control strategy to optimize the vehicle performance with a major concern for battery performance. The paper analyzes the performance of considered FESS model under the same control strategy and driving conditions. A MATLAB/SIMULINK model is used for the analysis of the vehicle for both urban and highway drives. Finally a comparison is drawn between the performance of the chemical battery, working in its best efficiency range, {{as a result of the}} applied control strategy, to that of the considered FESS. It is inferred from the simulated results that the performance of employed FESS is satisfactory in comparison to chemical batteries. It is therefore expected that FESS can be effectively employed in hybrid vehicles. Index Terms—Hybrid Vehicle, FESS, ELPH Vehicle I...|$|R
