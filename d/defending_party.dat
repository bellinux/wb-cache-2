60|$|The {{peculiar}} {{character of}} all the best kinds of dissent from the nominal creed of the time, makes it rather less {{difficult for us to}} try to reconcile unflinching honesty with a just and becoming regard for the feelings of those who have claims upon our forbearance, than would have been the case a hundred years ago. 'It is not now with a polite sneer,' as a high ecclesiastical authority lately admitted, 'still less with a rude buffet or coarse words, that Christianity is assailed.' Before churchmen congratulate themselves too warmly on this improvement {{in the nature of the}} attack, perhaps they ought to ask themselves how far it is due to the change in the position of the <b>defending</b> <b>party.</b> The truth is that the coarse and realistic criticism of which Voltaire was the consummate master, has done its work. It has driven the defenders of the old faith into the milder and more genial climate of non-natural interpretations, and the historic sense, and a certain elastic relativity of dogma. The old criticism was victorious, but after victory it vanished. One reason of this was that the coarse and realistic forms of belief had either vanished before it, or else they forsook their ancient pretensions and clothed themselves in more modest robes. The consequence of this, and of other causes which might be named, is that the modern attack, while fully as serious and much more radical, has a certain gravity, decorum, and worthiness of form. No one of any sense or knowledge now thinks the Christian religion had its origin in deliberate imposture. The modern freethinker does not attack it; he explains it. And what is more, he explains it by referring its growth to the better, and not to the worse part of human nature. He traces it to men's cravings for a higher morality. He finds its source in their aspirations after nobler expression of that feeling for the incommensurable things, which is in truth under so many varieties of inwoven pattern the common universal web of religious faith.|$|E

50|$|Primeau {{was chosen}} as Vision Montreal's caucus leader in December 2008. Two months later, he {{publicly}} <b>defended</b> <b>party</b> leader Benoît Labonté against criticisms from former executive director Robert Laramée, who had called on Labonté to resign or be ousted {{in the face of}} weak polling numbers. Labonté ultimately resigned as Vision Montreal leader in June 2009 and was replaced by Louise Harel.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "politically correct" [...] {{was used}} disparagingly, {{to refer to}} someone whose loyalty to the CP line overrode compassion, and led to bad politics.

50|$|For example, if {{a person}} were to {{threaten}} someone with an unloaded gun (not an actual lethal threat), the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> would not be convicted if defending themselves as if the gun were loaded (a lethal threat). This is because the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> may perceive the gun as loaded and thus lethal.|$|E
50|$|Dependent {{upon the}} {{location}} of where the lawsuit was originated, the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> has {{a period of time}} to file a countersuit, also known as a counter claim, against the claiming party. This is a direct claim from the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> against the party who initiated the lawsuit for concurrent claims, including being wrongfully sued.|$|E
5000|$|The {{interpretation}} of {{what is to be}} considered not [...] "blatantly unjustifiable" [...] is popularly expressed in Sweden as [...] "that force which is required by the peril". In other words, the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> may do whatever it takes so long as no alternative, less severe options are available (except fleeing the immediate area NJA 1969 p425, 1999 p460). The expression [...] "blatantly unjustifiable" [...] allows fairly generous tolerance towards the <b>defending</b> <b>party.</b>|$|E

25|$|Pleading (making a claim of) fraud or {{fraudulent}} misrepresentation {{should be}} undertaken with care, {{since it is}} a more serious claim and therefore will be looked at more stringently; if the case is lost or the claim would make no difference to the outcome, then any award in respect of the <b>defending</b> <b>party's</b> costs may be higher {{as a result of}} extra work to defend the claim. On the other hand, to not plead it when applicable may reduce the outcome of a case.|$|R
5000|$|However, the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> {{must also}} {{consider}} {{that which is}} defended and what injury is inflicted upon the attacker. If that which is defended is insignificant {{in comparison to the}} injuries to the attacker, the court may reject the claim that person acted in self-defense since the damage done to the attacker is [...] "blatantly unjustifiable". Loss of life or permanent bodily injury is rarely justified as self-defense unless the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> was in danger of being subjected to the same.|$|E

5000|$|According to American {{educator}} Herbert Kohl, {{writing about}} debates in New York {{in the late}} 1940s and early 1950s:The term [...] "politically correct" [...] was used disparagingly, to refer to someone whose loyalty to the CP line overrode compassion, and led to bad politics. It was used by Socialists against Communists, and was meant to separate out Socialists who believed in egalitarian moral ideas from dogmatic Communists who would advocate and <b>defend</b> <b>party</b> positions regardless of their moral substance.On the other hand, in inner-party debate sessions, the line can be questioned, criticized, and changed if necessary.|$|R

5000|$|A {{person who}} commits acts which are [...] "blatantly unjustifiable" [...] while in peril may also escape {{conviction}} {{if the situation}} were such that the person [...] "could {{not be expected to}} maintain control of himself".

50|$|By-elections {{were held}} in Belah and Castle wards on 5 March 2009, {{after the death of}} Conservative {{councillor}} for Belah, Sandra Fisher, in December 2008, and the resignation of Liberal Democrat councillor for Castle, Kimberly Hunter, in January 2009.

2500|$|The final {{determination}} of {{guilt or innocence}} is typically made by a third party, {{who is supposed to}} be disinterested. This function may be performed by a judge, a panel of judges, or a jury panel composed of unbiased citizens. This process varies depending on the laws of the specific jurisdiction. In some places the panel (be it judges or a jury) is required to issue a unanimous decision, while in others only a majority vote is required. In America, this process depends on the state, level of court, and even agreements between the prosecuting and <b>defending</b> <b>parties.</b> [...] Some nations do not use juries at all, or rely on theological or military authorities to issue verdicts.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} phrase used by Aristotle {{from which}} begging the question descends is: τὸ ἐξ ἀρχῆς (or sometimes ἐν ἀρχῇ) αἰτεῖν, {{asking for the}} initial thing. Aristotles intended meaning is {{closely tied to the}} type of dialectical argument he discusses in his Topics, book VIII: a formalized debate in which the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> asserts a thesis that the attacking party must attempt to refute by asking yes-or-no questions and deducing some inconsistency between the responses and the original thesis.|$|E
50|$|Fighting {{in urban}} areas negates the {{advantages}} that one side may have over the other in armour, heavy artillery, or air support. Ambushes laid down by small groups of soldiers with handheld anti-tank weapons can effectively destroy entire columns of modern armour (as in the First Battle of Grozny), while artillery and air support can be severely reduced if the 'superior' party wants to limit civilian casualties as much as possible, but the <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> does not (or even uses civilians as human shields).|$|E
5000|$|To {{capture a}} town the player must be {{adjacent}} {{to it and}} bombard it until it has no health left; the town will continue to fire on the ship until the health is depleted. A town upgrade applies on both town health and cannon power. When health is depleted a [...] "capture" [...] bar shows, and when full the town will be conquered. If an enemy ship nears the town, the [...] "capture" [...] will be paused until one of the ship sinks or flees. Towns automatically heal adjacent ships of the same party, so a <b>defending</b> <b>party</b> has an advantage.|$|E

All connections and disconnections of ULL and LLS are carried out by Telstra, regardless of whether those services relate to its own customers or customers of competing carriers. These same defendants pointed {{to the fact that}} end-users, the customers, can and do chose which service provider connects equipment to the local loops entering their premises, and as long as that choice is not Telstra, then Telstra have no use for that local loop.|$|R
