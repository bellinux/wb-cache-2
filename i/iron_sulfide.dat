40|$|International audienceThis paper {{gives an}} {{integrated}} probabilistic framework (IPF) {{that deals with}} the optimal layout of facilities in an industrial plant. The specific case of a crude oil tank farm is detailed in this present paper, which includes the tank fire {{as well as the}} corresponding optimal layout based on inherent safety and evacuation. The tank fire can be caused by the oxidative self-heating of pyrophoric <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> which extensively exist on the inner wall of the crude oil tank, especially in the respiratory/safety valves. Oxidative self-heating, or spontaneous combustion of <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> is a process of oxidation and generally influenced by five external factors including water content, mass per unit area of <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides,</b> operating temperature of tank, flow rate and concentration of oxygen facing the <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides.</b> According to the previous literature about self-heating process of <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides,</b> the maximum temperature (TmaxTmax) of solid phase is a vital indicator representing the pyrophoric feature of <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> in specific circumstances. And the maximum temperature (TmaxTmax) can be predicted by the model developed from support vector machine (SVM) technique. While the predicted maximum temperature (TmaxTmax) is compared with a defined threshold value, it can be revealed whether the oxidative self-heating of <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> will lead to explosion and then cause tank fire. On this grounds, the probability of tank fire due to the oxidative self-heating of <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> can be obtained by Monte Carlo simulations. For tank fire, the major physical damage to the surrounding tanks and workers is thermal radiation rather than overpressure or missile projection. Considering the worst case scenario, that is the vapor-liquid interface in the tank covered with fire, then the thermal radiation flux passing through a receiver at a specified distance away from the tank can be derived. In reverse, the critical horizontal distance between tank and receiver can be obtained if the critical thermal radiation flux through a receiver is given. Assuming that the minimum and maximum risks of thermal radiation to a receiver are separately 0 and 1 corresponding to different thermal radiation fluxes, then the risk of a tank or worker receiving a given thermal radiation flux can be determined by the thermal radiation flux equation. In a crude oil tank farm containing more than one tank, the potential thermal radiation flux received by an object at an arbitrary location is the superposition of those from different tanks. For the optimization of space collocation and floor area of tank farm from inherently safe design, if the damage risk of an object from other overall tanks equals to the critical acceptable damage risk, and the corresponding floor area of tank farm is the minimum, it will certainly result in an optimal space collocation. The handling method for the mentioned problem inherently reduces property loss and casualty to some extent...|$|R

25|$|Wegner {{suggests}} {{that a combination of}} naval ship design, and a change in the type of coal used to fuel naval ships, might have facilitated the explosion postulated by the Rickover study. Up to the time of Maines building, he explains, common bulkheads separated coal bunkers from ammunition lockers and American naval ships burned primarily smokeless anthracite coal. With {{an increase in the number}} of steel ships, the U.S. Navy switched to bituminous coal, which burned at a hotter temperature than anthracite coal, and allowed ships to steam faster. However, Wegner explains, while anthracite coal is not subject to spontaneous combustion, bituminous coal is considerably more volatile. In fact, bituminous coal is known for releasing the largest amounts of firedamp, a dangerous and explosive mixture of gases (chiefly methane). Firedamp is explosive at concentrations between 4% and 16%, with most violence at around 10%. In addition, there was another potential contributing factor in the bituminous coal – this was <b>iron</b> <b>sulfide,</b> also known as pyrite, that was likely present. The presence of pyrites presents two additional risk factors. The first involves oxidation. Pyrite oxidation is sufficiently exothermic that underground coal mines in high-sulfur coal seams have occasionally had serious problems with spontaneous combustion in the mined-out areas of the mine. This process can result from the disruption caused by mining from the seams, or other processing, which then exposes the sulfides in the ore to air and water. The presence of pyrites in coal has been recognized to be self-heating. The second risk factor involves an additional capability of pyrites to provide fire ignition under certain conditions. Pyrites, which derive their name from the Greek root word pyr, which means fire, can cause sparks when struck by steel or other sufficiently hard surfaces. Before the use of flintlock guns, for example, pyrites were used to strike sparks to ignite gunpowder in an earlier model type gun, known as a wheellock. In the presence of combustible gasses issuing from the bituminous coal, the pyrites could therefore have provided the ignition capability needed to create an explosion. A number of bunker fires of this type had, in fact, been reported aboard U.S. warships before Maines explosion, in several cases nearly sinking the ships. Wegner also cites a 1997 heat transfer study which concluded that a coal bunker fire, of the type suggested by Rickover, could have taken place and ignited the ship's ammunition.|$|E

40|$|The {{overall goal}} {{of this study is}} to {{evaluate}} the ability of novel nanostructured adsorbent media (NTAs, <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> (FeS 2 and FeS)) to remove arsenic, selenium and mercury from ash and scrubber pond effluents. The NTAs aim to enhance arsenic removal from solution compared to conventional adsorbents. The <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> are expected to produce stable residuals for ultimate disposal after removing As, Se and Hg from solution, so that removal of these compounds from wastewaters will not result in contamination of soils and groundwaters. Methods for reliably and economically producing these materials were developed. The synthesized NTAs and <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> were characterized by surface analysis techniques such as XRD, FT-IR, SEM-EDS, TEM, XPS, AFM and N 2 -adsorption. These analyses indicated that Ti(25) -SBA- 15 has highly ordered hexagonal mesopores, MT has interparticle mesopores, pyrite (FeS 2) forms crystalline, nonporous rectangular nanoparticles (< 500 nm), and mackinawite (FeS) forms amorphous, nonporous nanoparticles (< 100 nm). Kinetic and equilibrium tests for As(III, V) removal were conducted with NTAs over a range of pH (4, 7, 9. 5). The rates of arsenic uptake were very fast and followed a bi-phasic sorption pattern, where sorption was fast for the first 10 minutes, and then slowed and was almost completed within 200 minutes. Distinct sorption maxima for As(III) removal were observed between pH 7 and pH 9. 5 for MT and between pH 4 and pH 7 for Ti(25) -SBA- 15. The amount of As(V) adsorbed generally decreased as pH increased. In addition, a surface complexation model (SCM) based on the diffuse layer model (DLM) was used to predict arsenic adsorption envelopes by NTAs under various environmental conditions. The SCM for As(III, V) adsorption by NTAs demonstrated the role of mono- and bidentate surface complexes in arsenic adsorption. A batch reactor system was employed in an anaerobic chamber to conduct experiments to characterize both the removal of As, Se, Hg from solution and their subsequent reactions with <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides.</b> Experiment variables for removal experiments included: contaminant valence state (As(V), As(III), Se(VI), Se(IV), Hg(II)); adsorbent/reactant type (FeS, FeS 2); adsorbent/reactant concentration; pH (7, 8, 9, 10); and competing ion (SO 42 -) concentration (0, 1, 10 mM). Experimental variables for reaction experiments were reaction time (up to 30 days) at pH 8 and oxidation states of contaminants. In addition, the stability of <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> (FeS 2, FeS) combined with target compounds was investigated by measuring the ability of the target compounds to resist release to the aqueous phase after removal. These experiments showed that <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> were good adsorbent/reactants for target contaminants in spite of the presence of sulfate. This was particularly true at intermediate concentrations of target compounds. The experiments also demonstrated that <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> interacted with target contaminants in such a way to improve their resistance to being released back to solution as pH was changed. Therefore, this study demonstrates the ability of novel nanostructured adsorbent media to remove arsenic, selenium and mercury from ash and scrubber pond effluents and the ability of <b>iron</b> <b>sulfides</b> to produce residuals that are stable when disposed in landfills...|$|R
