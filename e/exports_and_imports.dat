5|$|Nevertheless, as of 2008, Japan {{still was}} Germany's second largest trading partner in Asia after China. In 2006, German imports from Japan totaled €15.6billion and German exports to Japan €14.2billion (15.4% and 9% {{more than the}} {{previous}} year, respectively). In 2008, however, Japanese <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> <b>imports</b> {{to and from the}} European Union fell by 7.8 and 4.8% after growing by 5.8% in 2007 due to the global financial crisis. Bilateral trade between Germany and Japan also shrank in 2008, with imports from Japan having dropped by 6.6% and German exports to Japan having declined by 5.5%. Despite Japan having remained Germany's principal trading partner in Asia after China in 2008, measured in terms of total German foreign trade, Japan’s share of both <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> <b>imports</b> is relatively low and falls well short of the potential between the world’s third- and fifth-largest economies.|$|E

Whilst export/import facilities provide opportunities for international trade and competition, they are not without negative effect, and British horticulture {{is one example of}} domestic industry damaged by cheap imports.|$|E

40|$|The rupiah {{exchange}} rate, <b>import,</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> are {{the important}} indicators in economy, including the Indonesia economy. The debate regarding {{the relationship among}} the exchange rate, <b>import,</b> <b>and</b> <b>export</b> has been persisting for several decades. Some researchers found {{that there is a}} relationship among those three and others explained that there is no correlation among them. The aim of this research is to obtain the empirical evidence of the causal relationship among the <b>export,</b> <b>import,</b> <b>and</b> foreign exchange rate by using the monthly data from January 2010 to April 2014. The <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>import</b> data are the <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>import</b> values in US dollar. The exchange rate data is the median exchange rates of the Indonesian Bank. The Johansen Cointegration Test and the Granger Causality Test are used to analyze the data. The research result shows that <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>import</b> have no causal relationship at five percent. Next, the foreign exchange rate influences the <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>import</b> at 10 percent level. The result indicates that the foreign exchange rate has small effects on the <b>export</b> <b>and</b> <b>import.</b> Based on the results, the government should control the balance of trade and should not make any policy that is based on the exchange rate values. Finally, {{it can be said that}} the exchange rate policy is not effective in increasing the <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> reducing the <b>imports.</b> </em...|$|R

Therefore, economic growth was shared between the city of Famagusta and the district, which had a balanced agricultural economy, with citrus, potatoes, tobacco and wheat as main products.

The city's port remained the island's main seaport and in 1961, it was expanded to double its capacity in order to accommodate the growing volume of <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> <b>imports.</b> The port handled 42.7% of Cypriot exports, 48.6% of imports and 49% of passenger traffic.|$|E

This resistance continued till the French conquered the Imerina, meaning most of Anosy was not controlled by the Imerina kingdom, but rather only Fort Dauphin, its neighboring town of Andrahomana and Manafiafy, where they collected duty on <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> <b>imports.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} accounts balance would be {{positively related to}} carbon emissions. The {{national accounts}} balance shows the difference between <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> <b>imports.</b> For many richer nations, such as the United States, the accounts balance is negative because more goods are imported than they are exported. This is mostly {{due to the fact}} that it is cheaper to produce goods outside of developed countries, leading the economies of developed countries to become increasingly dependent on services and not goods. We believed that a positive accounts balance would means that more production was occurring in a country, so more factories working would increase carbon emission levels.(Holtz-Eakin, 1995, pp.;85;101).|$|E

During Fox's administrations several FTAs were signed with Latin American and European countries, Japan and Israel, and both strove to maintain macroeconomic stability. Thus, Mexico {{became one of the most}} open countries in the world to trade, and the economy base shifted accordingly. Total trade with the United States and Canada tripled, and total <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> <b>imports</b> almost quadrupled between 1991 and 2003.

Each month, the Board of Trade published figures of the 'balance of trade' between <b>exports</b> <b>and</b> <b>imports</b> which seemed to show an ever-increasing deficit. The closure of the Suez Canal after the Six-Day War hit exporters, as did an unofficial dock strike, which broke {{out at the end}} of September. Having put up the bank rate to 6 percent on 19 October, on 18 November, the government abandoned three years of attempting to maintain the exchange rate and devalued the pound sterling from $2.80 to $2.40. Although it was an economic defeat, devaluation was perceived as an export opportunity that British industry needed to seize.|$|E
