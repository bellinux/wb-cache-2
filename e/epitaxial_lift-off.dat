40|$|The <b>epitaxial</b> <b>lift-off</b> (ELO) {{process is}} a {{technique}} that allows the separation of a single crystalline film from the substrate it was deposited on via the etching of an intermediate AlAs release layer. For this purpose, the extreme selectivity of hydrofluoric acid (HF) for AlAs over GaAs is employed. The technique has a large potential for optoelectronic applications, because {{it can lead to}} several benefits. Among these are cost reduction via a substrate reuse, increased power output of devices because of better cooling capabilities and the integration of III/V based devices with silicon circuitry. ELO, however, can only be implemented on an industrial scale in device processing if the rate at which substrate and epilayers are separated is sufficiently high. The lateral etch rate of the process has therefore been under serious investigation during the last years. In the present thesis several of the relevant process parameters have been investigated, leading {{to a better understanding of}} the process. Furthermore, the area of the released devices and the etch rate at which this occurs have increased dramatically. In order to show that <b>epitaxial</b> <b>lift-off</b> does not have a negative effect on devices that are subjected to the procedure, ELO solar cells are compared to identical structures that are fabricated while they are still on their substrate.

40|$|There is a {{significant}} gap between the internal efficiency of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and their external efficiency.

Moreover, by nanotexturing the thin-film surface using "natural lithography," the light ray dynamics becomes chaotic, and the optical phase-space distribution becomes "ergodic," allowing even more of the light to find the escape cone.

40|$|<b>Epitaxial</b> <b>lift-off</b> (ELO) is {{a process}} which allows for the {{separation}} of a single crystalline III/V thin film or device from the substrate it was deposited on. This process {{is based on the}} selective etching of an intermediate AlAs release layer in an aqueous HF solution. The lateral etch rate of the AlAs release layer through a narrow crevice in the weight-induced <b>epitaxial</b> <b>lift-off</b> (WI-ELO) process is much larger than observed for unobstructed planar AlAs layers. It is possible that this increase in etch rate is caused by the tensile strain induced upon the AlAs layer in the WI-ELO setup. In order to verify this assumption, planar AlAs layers, subjected to a controlled curvature, were etched in HF solutions and their etch duration was measured. The applied curvature reduced the already present compressive strain due to lattice mismatch. For large applied bending radii no change in etch rate was observed, because the induced bending is smaller than the already present bending due to the lattice mismatch. Further bending induces a total compressive strain from - 0. 126 % to - 0. 11 %, resulting in an etch rate variation from 0. 054 up to 0. 066 mm h(- 1). Measurements on AlAs layers experiencing a tensile strain of + 0. 286 % showed much higher etch rates of 0. 134 mm h(- 1). The present results obtained on etching experiments in the lateral plane are extrapolated to the perpendicular direction so that a combination with the data from previous work becomes feasible. This results in a better microscopic picture of the etch front in the WI-ELO process. It is found that the force exerted by the weight can be projected on an area, limited by the sample width and a depth of approximately 6 mum...|$|E
