5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement,</b> and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated with the drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E

30|$|Hypothyroidism is {{associated}} with an increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (Ichiki, 2010) and cardiovascular morbidity (Hak et al., 2000), which is in accordance with autopsy studies showing that the atherosclerotic process is increased in hypothyroidism (Steinberg, 1968) and decreased in hyperthyroidism (Myasnikov et al., 1963). The increased cardiovascular morbidity in hypothyroid patients has been related to elevated levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), which are normalized after thyoid <b>hormones</b> <b>replacement</b> (Yazbeck et al., 2001). Elevated cholesterol and lipoprotein levels may be partly responsible for the high risk of vascular disease associated with hypothyroidism. However, lipid abnormalities in hypothyroid patients do not fully account for the accelerated atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, and other pathogenic factors may be involved (Masaki et al., 1992; Mamiya et al., 1989).|$|R
5|$|Blood free {{thyroxine}} and TSH {{levels are}} monitored {{to help determine}} whether the dose is adequate. This is done 4–8 weeks {{after the start of}} treatment or a change in levothyroxine dose. Once the adequate replacement dose has been established, the tests can be repeated after 6 and then 12 months, unless there is a change in symptoms. In people with central/secondary hypothyroidism, TSH is not a reliable marker of <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> and decisions are based mainly on the free T4 level. Levothyroxine is best taken 30–60 minutes before breakfast, or four hours after food, as certain substances such as food and calcium can inhibit the absorption of levothyroxine. There is no direct way of increasing thyroid hormone secretion by the thyroid gland.|$|E
5|$|Products {{collected}} from living horses include mare's milk, used {{by people with}} large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis.

40|$|Abstract Transient hypothyroxinaemia of {{prematurity}} (THOP) is common. The {{preponderance of}} evidence indicates that {{at the very least}} THOP is a marker of elevated risk of neurodevelopmental adversity. Existing observational and experimental studies could neither support nor dispute the use of thyroid hormones in preterm infants. The experimental studies 39 - 42 done so far had major limitations because of the small number of infants enrolled in the trials. For future large multicenter randomized trials, energies should be focused on assessing neurodevelopment objectively in survivors and consider enrolling only those infants most likely to benefit from thyroid <b>hormones</b> <b>replacement</b> therapy. Moreover, the addition of triiodothyronine (T 3) to the treatment schedule needs to be seriously considered. Furthermore, since local pilot study revealed iodine deficiency in 35. 8 % of the studied healthy pregnant women 3 and the effect of iodine deficiency may probably be more significant in preterms, one will probably choose to treat.

5|$|Genetics {{may play}} a role in a person's {{disposition}} to SAH; risk is increased three- to fivefold in first-degree relatives of people having had a subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, lifestyle factors are more important in determining overall risk. These risk factors are smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and excessive alcohol consumption. Having smoked in the past confers a doubled risk of SAH compared to those who have never smoked. Some protection of uncertain significance is conferred by caucasian ethnicity, <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> therapy, and diabetes mellitus. There is likely an inverse relationship between total serum cholesterol and the risk of non-traumatic SAH, though confirmation of this association is hindered by a lack of studies. Approximately 4 percent of aneurysmal bleeds occur after sexual intercourse and 10 percent of people with SAH are bending over or lifting heavy objects at the onset of their symptoms.|$|E
5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement.</b>|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly.

40|$|There are well-recognized sex {{differences}} in many pituitary endocrine axes, usually thought to be generated by gonadal steroid imprinting of the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. However, the recognition that growth hormone (GH) cells are arranged in functionally organized networks {{raises the possibility that}} the responses of the network are different in males and females. We studied this by directly monitoring the calcium responses to an identical GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulus in populations of individual GH cells in slices taken from male and female murine GH-eGFP pituitary glands. We found that the GH cell network responses are sexually dimorphic, with a higher proportion of responding cells in males than in females, correlated with greater GH release from male slices. Repetitive waves of calcium spiking activity were triggered by GHRH in some males, but were never observed in females. This was not due to a permanent difference in the network architecture between male and female mice; rather, the sex difference in the proportions of GH cells responding to GHRH were switched by postpubertal gonadectomy and reversed with <b>hormone</b> <b>replacements,</b> suggesting that the network responses are dynamically regulated in adulthood by gonadal steroids. Thus, the pituitary gland contributes to the sexually dimorphic patterns of GH secretion that {{play an important role in}} differences in growth and metabolism between the sexes...|$|R
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>replacement</b> may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although {{intracranial}} hemorrhage occurs rarely in patients due to chronic {{idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura}} (ITP), it is usually a life-threatening situation. We report a case of hypopituitarism presented with pituitary apoplexy due to ITP. Case: A 47 year old woman was admitted to hospital with the complaints of nausea, vomiting, vertigo and petechial hemorrage. Three months before admission, she admitted to another hospital because of ptosis, headache and diplopia. Transsphenoidal biopsy examination of the intrasellar mass was reported as pituitary apoplexy. During peroperative period, she received high dose steroids so that the platelet count was 90 000 per cubic millimeter. Last 2 - 3 months, she was not taken any medication herself. On physical examination revealed ortostasis and the patient appeared somehow confused. There were extensive petechiae over her legs and arms. In laboratory analysis we detected severe thrombocytopenia (5000 /mm 3) and low serum levels of pituitary and other target organ <b>hormones.</b> <b>Replacement</b> treatment with steroid and thyroid hormones and splenectomy {{were introduced to the}} patient. Conclusions: We report a case with hypopituitarism secondary to hypophyseal apoplexy due to ITP that was a very rare situation in the literature published. We suggest that ITP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with pituitary apoplexy. The patients with hypopituitarism and related diseases should be given proper treatment with close follow up...|$|R
