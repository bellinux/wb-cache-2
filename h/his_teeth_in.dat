Mulder gives one of the implants to Scully, who has it reviewed by a ballistics expert; they find a microscopic barcode imprinted on it. Later, at a supermarket, Scully swipes the implant across a checkout scanner, causing the machine to malfunction while displaying a strange serial number. At her house, Scully leaves a message on Mulder's voicemail, suggesting that Barry had been [...] "catalogued" [...] by the implant.

500|$|In September 1963, after Cox was {{discharged}} from the Army, he and Hendrix moved to Clarksville, Tennessee, and formed a band called the King Kasuals. Hendrix had watched Butch Snipes play with <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> Seattle and by now Alphonso 'Baby Boo' Young, the other guitarist in the band, was performing this guitar gimmick. Not to be upstaged, Hendrix learned to play with his teeth. He later commented: [...] "The idea of doing that came to me...in Tennessee. Down there {{you have to play}} with your teeth or else you get shot. There's a trail of broken teeth all over the stage." [...] Although they began playing low-paying gigs at obscure venues, the band eventually moved to Nashville's Jefferson Street, which was the traditional heart of the city's black community and home to a thriving rhythm and blues music scene. They earned a brief residency playing at a popular venue in town, the Club del Morocco, and {{for the next two years}} Hendrix made a living performing at a circuit of venues throughout the South that were affiliated with the Theater Owners' Booking Association (TOBA), widely known as the Chitlin' Circuit. In addition to playing in his own band, Hendrix performed as a backing musician for various soul, R, and blues musicians, including Wilson Pickett, Slim Harpo, Sam Cooke, and Jackie Wilson.|$|E
500|$|During his sabbatical, Madhavan {{also worked}} {{extensively}} on the pre-production of the bilingual sports film, Irudhi Suttru (2016) directed by Sudha Kongara. After being impressed with Sudha's script, he helped find the project producers in Tamil and chose to produce the film in Hindi alongside Sashikanth and Rajkumar Hirani. Madhavan also met and convinced mixed martial artist Ritika Singh {{to act in the}} film after contacting her through Raj Kundra, while he was also credited for contributing as an additional screenplay writer. He also went through a body conditioning regime in Los Angeles prior to joining the film's set and learnt boxing to essay the role of a former boxer. For dubbing purposes, Madhavan wore metal braces inside <b>his</b> <b>teeth,</b> <b>in</b> order to create the effect of having a lisp that most boxers have from sporting injuries. Madhavan won praise for his work during the marketing campaign, having travelled throughout Tamil Nadu to promote the film, with The Hindu stating it was [...] "unlike other film promotions in the South". For Irudhi Suttru, Madhavan received widespread critical acclaim for his portrayal with Sify.com stating [...] "he is outstanding and carries the proverbial burden of the project on his shoulder". A critic from The Hindu stated that he was [...] "quietly effective", while a reviewer from Behindwoods.com wrote that Madhavan gives his [...] "best performance" [...] and is [...] "excellent" [...] at depicting his [...] "characterization from being subtle to being outright effervescent". His portrayal in the Hindi version, Saala Khadoos, received similar praise with critic Subhash K. Jha stating [...] "this is Madhavan’s career-defining performance, he sinks so deep into his role both physically and emotionally, that the actor becomes one with the act".|$|E
2500|$|Much of the Safe as Milk {{material}} was honed and arranged {{by the arrival}} of 20-year–old guitar prodigy Ry Cooder, who had been brought into the group after much pressure from Vliet. The band began recording in spring 1967, with Richard Perry cutting <b>his</b> <b>teeth</b> <b>in</b> his first job as producer. The album was released in September 1967. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic called the album [...] "blues–rock gone slightly askew, with jagged, fractured rhythms, soulful, twisting vocals from Van Vliet, and more doo wop, soul, straight blues, and folk–rock influences than he would employ on his more avant garde outings." ...|$|E

Although he also {{admitted that he had}} chewed upon the excised uterus of his female victims and the testicles of his male victims, he stated he had later discarded these body parts. Nonetheless, Chikatilo did confess to having swallowed the nipples of some of his victims.|$|E
