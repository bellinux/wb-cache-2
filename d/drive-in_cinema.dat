2500|$|Land near Innaloo {{was first}} granted to Thomas Mews in 1831. In 1898, Town Properties of WA {{subdivided}} the lands around Njookenbooroo Swamp for sale as market gardens and drained the swamp into Herdsman Lake {{over the following}} years, digging channels through the area [...] to facilitate agriculture. They offered rent-free lease of the lots with an option to later purchase at £100 per hectare if the occupants cleared them and brought them into production. The area between Hertha Road, Oswald Street and King Edward Road and Herdsman Lake was gazetted as the Njookenbooroo Drainage District, and by 1912, local market gardeners were turning off 25 tonnes of produce each week, even considering {{the vagaries of the}} weather and occasional pests. The Njookenbooroo School on Odin Road (then called Government Road), linked to the city by a plank road, was built in 1915. Although subdivision for southern Innaloo was approved in 1916, by the 1920s only ten houses had been built, with the majority of the land used for grazing.

40|$|Contrary to {{the claims}} of some film historians, the {{drive-in}} was not a uniquely American invention. Australian <b>drive-in</b> <b>cinemas</b> were, {{at least in the}} 1950 s and 1960 s, distinguishable from their American counterparts by virtue of the profusion of additional amusements (or distractions) they offered alongside film-viewing. This article traces the history of Australian drive-ins as ‘entertainment centres’ and ‘high temples of modernity’. It argues that the drive-in can usefully be understood as a mid-point between the domestic and public spheres, and a powerful symbol of post-WWII Australia, signifying prosperity, gathering consumer confidence and, in metropolitan areas, marking the path of urban development through its concentration in new, outer suburban areas...|$|R

50|$|Dolby 3D uses a Dolby Digital Cinema {{projector}} {{that can}} show both 2D and 3D films. For 3D presentations, an alternate color wheel {{is placed in}} the projector. This color wheel contains one more set of red, green, and blue filters in addition to the red, green, and blue filters found on a typical color wheel. The additional set of three filters are able to produce the same color gamut as the original three filters, but transmit light at different wavelengths. Glasses with complementary dichroic filters in the lenses are worn, which filter out either one or the other set of three light wavelengths. In this way, one projector can display the left and right stereoscopic images simultaneously. This method of stereoscopic projection is called wavelength multiplex visualization. The dichroic filters in the Dolby 3D glasses are more expensive and fragile than the glasses technology used in circular polarization systems like RealD Cinema or linear polarization systems like Digital IMAX and are not considered disposable. However, an important benefit of Dolby 3D in comparison with RealD is that Dolby 3D works with conventional projection screens. Dolby 3D also produces a brighter and sharper 3D image than RealD and is able to be comfortably viewed on outdoor <b>cinema</b> screens and <b>drive-in</b> <b>cinemas.</b>|$|R
