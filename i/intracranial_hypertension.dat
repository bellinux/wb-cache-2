5|$|Idiopathic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hypertension</b> (IIH) is a {{condition}} characterized by increased intracranial pressure (pressure around the brain) without a detectable cause. The main symptoms are headache, vision problems, ringing in the ears with the heartbeat, and shoulder pain. Complications may include vision loss.|$|E
5|$|Improvements on the {{diagnosis}} of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in life were made {{with the introduction of}} venography in 1951, which also aided in the distinction from idiopathic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hypertension,</b> which has similar presenting signs and symptoms in many cases.|$|E
5|$|Various analgesics (painkillers) {{may be used}} in {{controlling}} the headaches of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hypertension.</b> In addition to conventional agents such as paracetamol, a low dose of the antidepressant amitriptyline or the anticonvulsant topiramate have shown some additional benefit for pain relief.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Because venous {{hypertension}} {{determines the}} clinical sever-ity of dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), evaluation of intracranial venous pressure {{is important in}} making decisions concerning treatment. We determined whether <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>hypertension</b> could be quantified by using an acetazolamide test {{in a manner that}} indicates whether treatment of the DAVF is necessary. METHODS: We enrolled 21 untreated patients: 11 with a sigmoid and/or transverse DAVF, six with a cavernous DAVF, two with an anterior cranial fossa DAVF, and two with a superior sagittal sinus DAVF. Cerebral hemodynamics were studied with stable-xenon CT. Patients were angiographically classified into three groups, and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after acetazolamide challenge was compared between angiographic groups, between patients with and those without symptoms attributable to <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>hypertension,</b> and between preembolization and postembolization examinations. RESULTS: A high angiographic grade was associated with decreased resting rCBF and a blunted response to acetazolamide. Response to acetazolamide was more sensitive to venous hypertension, as angiographically assessed, than decreased resting rCBF. Resting rCBF an...|$|R
40|$|We {{quantify}} {{the effect of}} internal-jugular vein function on intracranial venous haemodynamics, with particular attention paid to venous reflux and <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>hypertension.</b> Haemodynamics {{in the head and}} neck is quantified by computing the velocity, flow and pressure fields, and vessel cross-sectional area in all major arteries and veins. For the computations we use a global, closed-loop multi-scale mathematical model for the entire human circulation, recently developed by the first two authors. Validation of the model against in vitro and in vivo Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements have been reported elsewhere. Here, the circulation model is equipped with a sub-model for venous valves. For the study, in addition to a healthy control, we identify two venous-valve related conditions, namely valve incompetence and valve obstruction. A parametric study for subjects in the supine position is carried out for nine cases. It is found that valve function has a visible effect on intracranial venous haemodynamics, including dural sinuses and deep cerebral veins. In particular, valve obstruction causes venous reflux, redirection of flow and <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>hypertension.</b> The clinical implications of the findings are unknown, though they may relate to recent hypotheses linking some neurological conditions to extra-cranial venous anomalies...|$|R

5|$|Idiopathic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hypertension</b> is a {{condition}} of unknown cause characterised by a rise in CSF pressure. It is associated with headaches, double vision, difficulties seeing, and a swollen optic disc. It can occur {{in association with the}} use of Vitamin A and tetracycline antibiotics, or without any identifiable cause at all, particularly in younger obese women. Management may include ceasing any known causes, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor such as acetazolamide, repeated drainage via lumbar puncture, or the insertion of a shunt such as a ventriculoperitoneal shunt.|$|E
5|$|The best-studied medical {{treatment}} for <b>intracranial</b> <b>hypertension</b> is acetazolamide (Diamox), which acts by inhibiting the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, and it reduces CSF production by six to 57 percent. It {{can cause the}} symptoms of hypokalemia (low blood potassium levels), which include muscle weakness and tingling in the fingers. Acetazolamide cannot be used in pregnancy, since {{it has been shown}} to cause embryonic abnormalities in animal studies. Also, in human beings it has been shown to cause metabolic acidosis as well as disruptions in the blood electrolyte levels of newborn babies. The diuretic furosemide is sometimes used for a treatment if acetazolamide is not tolerated, but this drug sometimes has little effect on the ICP.|$|E
5|$|Testing often {{including}} {{observing the}} colour of the fluid, measuring CSF pressure, and counting and identifying {{white and red}} blood cells within the fluid; measuring protein and glucose levels; and culturing the fluid. The presence of red blood cells and xanthochromia may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage; whereas central nervous system infections such as meningitis, may be indicated by elevated white blood cell levels. A CSF culture may yield the microorganism that has caused the infection, or PCR {{may be used to}} identify a viral cause. Investigations to the total type and nature of proteins reveal point to specific diseases, including multiple sclerosis, paraneoplastic syndromes, systemic lupus erythematosus, neurosarcoidosis, cerebral angiitis; and specific antibodies such as Aquaporin 4 may be tested for to assist in the diagnosis of autoimmune conditions. A lumbar puncture that drains CSF may also be used as part of treatment for some conditions, including idiopathic <b>intracranial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and normal pressure hydrocephalus.|$|E

40|$|Cerebral {{arteriovenous}} fistula (AVF) is a vascular malformation that {{is rare in}} {{the pediatric}} population. Older children with cerebral AVF tend to present with neurologic problems related to <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>hypertension</b> or <b>intracranial</b> hemorrhage. Cardiac and pulmonary complications following acute neurologic injury such as subarachnoid hemorrhage are common in adults, but are rarely reported in children. However, complications {{have been reported in}} cases of enterovirus 71 rhombencephalitis in infants and children and can cause high morbidity and mortality. Here, we report a 14 -year-old boy who presented with cardiac failure associated with pulmonary edema following cerebral hemorrhagic stroke due to AVF.

40|$|Lacunar infarcts {{constitute}} a subtype of stroke with {{a diameter of}} less than 15 mm manifested {{by the presence of}} lacunar syndromes. The ischemic lesion in lacunar infarcts may often be caused by occlusion of a single, small perforating artery. However it is known that lacunar infarcts may also be associated with large artery disease, cardioembolism, and other less frequently encountered causes including antiphospholipidic syndrome, amyloid angiopathy, infectious arteritis, and inflammatory arteritis. A lacunar infarct of venous type is unusual. A 72 -year-old woman presented with left hemiparesis that developed within the last several hours. She also had mild dementia for several months. Radiological examination showed a white matter lacunar infarct evidenced by restricted diffusion and T 2 abnormality and dural arteriovenous fistula of the superior sagittal sinus. Because the segment distal to the fistula was occluded the fistulous flow was drained away from the sinus via retrograde flow through the cortical veins, which leaded to <b>intracranial</b> venous <b>hypertension.</b> The findings in our patient suggest that venous causes should also be considered in the differential diagnosis of lacunar infarcts...|$|R
25|$|It {{generally}} {{occurs in}} small arteries or arterioles and is commonly due to <b>hypertension,</b> <b>intracranial</b> vascular malformations (including cavernous angiomas or arteriovenous malformations), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, or infarcts into which secondary hemorrhage has occurred.

The hematoma enlarges until pressure from surrounding tissue limits its growth, or until it decompresses by emptying into the ventricular system, CSF or the pial surface. A third of intracerebral bleed is into the brain's ventricles.

40|$|Genetic and {{environmental}} factors play roles in the aetiology of ruptured <b>intracranial</b> aneurysms. <b>Hypertension</b> has been reported as {{a risk factor for}} intracranial aneurysm haemorrhage. We have tested if genotypes at the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene locus are associated with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. The insertion/deletion polymorphism in the ACE gene was genotyped in 258 ¬†subjects presenting in East Anglia with ruptured intracranial aneurysms (confirmed at surgery or angiographically) and 299 ¬†controls from the same region. ACE allele frequencies were significantly different in the cases and the controls (alleles œá 21 = 4. 67, p= 0. 03). The I allele was associated with aneurysm risk (odds ratio for I allele v D allele¬†=¬† 1. 3 ¬†(95 % CI= 1. 02 - 1 - 65); odds ratio for II v DD genotype¬†=¬† 1. 67 ¬†(95 % CI= 1. 04 - 2. 66)). The I allele at the ACE locus is over-represented in subjects with ruptured intracranial aneurysms. These data are supported by non-significant trends in the same direction in two previous smaller studies. Thus, this allele may be associated with risk for ruptured intracranial aneurysms. ‚Ä®‚Ä®‚Ä®Keywords: ACE I allele; ruptured intracranial aneurysm...|$|R
40|$|To {{emphasize}} the important association of {{polycystic kidney disease}} and hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage, a registry of 900 consecutive cases of hemorrhagic stroke was reviewed. Eleven patients (1. 2 %) had intracranial hemorrhage (eight had hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage {{and the other three}} had aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage) found to be associated with polycystic kidney disease. These 11 patients also accounted for 11 % of the 98 cases of polycystic kidney disease during the 28 -month study period. As verified by computed tomography, parenchyma! hemorrhage occurred mainly in the putamen and the thalamus, the usual sites for hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage. One patient with cerebral hemorrhage was autopsied and one was studied angiographically, but in neither patient was an intracranial aneurysm identified.

25|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of acute optic neuropathy include painless loss of vision which may affect either one or both eyes, reduced visual acuity, reduced color vision, relative afferent pupillary defect, central scotoma, swollen optic disc, macular edema, or retrobulbar pain. When these symptoms occur with concurrent mucocutaneous ulcerations, they raise suspicion of acute optic neuropathy in Beh√ßet's Disease. Progressive optic atrophy may result in decreased visual acuity or color vision. <b>Intracranial</b> <b>hypertension</b> with papilledema may be present.|$|E
25|$|Other common neuropsychiatric {{manifestations of}} SLE include {{cognitive}} dysfunction, mood disorder, cerebrovascular disease, seizures, polyneuropathy, anxiety disorder, psychosis, depression, {{and in some}} extreme cases, personality disorders.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that social engagement is associated with larger brain volumes in a cohort study of 348 older male former lead manufacturing workers (= 305) and population-based controls (= 43), age 48 to 82. Social engagement was measured using a summary scale derived from confirmatory factor analysis. The volumes of 20 regions of interest (ROIs), including total brain, total gray matter (GM), total white matter (WM), {{each of the four}} lobar GM and WM, and 9 smaller structures were derived from T 1 -weighted structural magnetic resonance images. Linear regression models adjusted for age, education, race/ethnicity, <b>intracranial</b> volume, <b>hypertension,</b> diabetes, and control (versus lead worker) status. Higher social engagement was associated with larger total brain and GM volumes, specifically temporal and occipital GM, but was not associated with WM volumes except for corpus callosum. A voxel-wise analysis supported an association in temporal lobe GM. Using longitudinal data to discern temporal relations, change in ROI volumes over five years showed null associations with current social engagement. Findings are consistent with {{the hypothesis that}} social engagement preserves brain tissue, and not consistent with the alternate hypothesis that persons with smaller or shrinking volumes become less socially engaged, though this scenario cannot be ruled out...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{presentation}} of this case is evaluating the relation between subarachnoidal hemorrhage and cocaine use. In our case, 29 year - old male was admitted to our clinic due to vomiting and loss of consciousness. We were told {{that he had a}} cocaine use history. Subarachnoidal hemorrhage was determined by computerized tomography (CT). Digital substraction angiography (DSA) study showed two aneurysms one of which was at the left internal carotid artery (ICA) and the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) bifurcation. The patient was operated in our clinic by a subfrontal keyhole approach and both of the aneurysms were clipped. During the follow up extraventricular drainage operation was made because of hydrocephalus and after that V-P shunt was applied. He died at 09 / 10 / 2003 because of massive G ƒ∞S hemorrhage which was probably due to Dƒ∞C. Cocaine may affect clinical presentation and prognosis in the patients with subarachnaidal hemorrhage.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Stroke is {{the major}} cause of {{disability}} and third major cause of death. Ischemia causes about 80 % of stroke cases; stenosis and occlusion are the predominant cause of stroke. Our purpose {{for this study was}} to evaluate the pattern and distribution of stenosis and its association with risk factors in Indian ischemic stroke patients and in other countries, for comparison. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We evaluated 60 patients after ischemic stroke with CT angiography. The degree of stenosis was measured by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET). The results were analyzed by descriptive statistics and chi-square test. RESULTS: Out of 60 cases, 32 cases were positive for significant stenosis and a total number of stenotic segments was 45. Out of 45 stenotic segments, 29 were single stenotic segments (16 intracranial and 13 extracranial) and 16 were multiple stenotic segments (8 intracranial and 8 extracranial). In the total number of stenotic segments (single and multiple), there were 24 (53. 33 %) intracranial and 21 (46. 67 %) extracranial. The most commonly involved intracranial stenosis segment was MCA, present in 10 (41. 6 %) out of 24 intracranial segments. Most commonly involved extracranial stenosis segment was ICA, present in 14 (66. 6 %) out of 21 extracranial segments. Diabetes is found to be the most common risk factor of <b>intracranial</b> stenosis while <b>hypertension</b> and hypercholesterolemia are the major risk factors of extracranial stenosis.

25|$|Given its rarity, {{the optimal}} {{treatment}} for acute optic neuropathy in Beh√ßet's disease {{has not been}} established. Early identification and treatment is essential. Response to ciclosporin, periocular triamcinolone, and IV methylprednisone followed by oral prednisone has been reported although relapses leading to irreversible visual loss may occur even with treatment. Immunosuppressants such as interferon alpha and tumour necrosis factor antagonists may improve though not completely reverse symptoms of ocular Beh√ßet's disease, which may progress over time despite treatment. When symptoms are limited to the anterior chamber of the eye prognosis is improved. Posterior involvement, particularly optic nerve involvement, is a poor prognostic indicator.

25|$|Visual acuity, {{or color}} vision loss with {{concurrent}} mucocutaneous lesions or systemic Beh√ßet's disease symptoms should raise suspicion of optic nerve involvement in Beh√ßet's disease and prompt a work-up for Beh√ßet's disease if not previously diagnosed {{in addition to}} an ocular work-up. Diagnosis of Beh√ßet's disease is based on clinical findings including oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions such as erythema nodosum, acne, or folliculitis, ocular inflammatory findings and a pathergy reaction. Inflammatory markers such ESR, and CRP may be elevated. A complete ophthalmic examination may include a slit lamp examination, optical coherence tomography to detect nerve loss, visual field examinations, fundoscopic examination to assess optic disc atrophy and retinal disease, fundoscopic angiography, and visual evoked potentials, which may demonstrate increased latency. Optic nerve enhancement may be identified on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) in some patients with acute optic neuropathy. However, a normal study does not rule out optic neuropathy. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis may demonstrate elevated protein level with or without pleocytosis. Imaging including angiography may be indicated to identify dural venous sinus thrombosis as a cause of <b>intracranial</b> <b>hypertension</b> and optic atrophy.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: After stroke, {{pneumonia}} is {{a relevant}} medical complication {{that can be}} precipitated by aspiration of saliva, liquids, or solid food. Swallowing difficulty and aspiration occur in {{a significant proportion of}} stroke survivors. Cough, an important mechanism protecting the lungs from inhaled materials, can be impaired in stroke survivors, and the likely cause for this impairment is central weakness of the respiratory musculature. Thus, respiratory muscle training in acute stroke may be useful in the recovery of respiratory muscle and cough function, and may thereby reduce the risk of pneumonia. The present study is a pilot study, aimed at investigating the validity and feasibility of this approach by exploring effect size, safety, and patient acceptability of the intervention. METHODS/DESIGN: Adults with moderate to severe stroke impairment (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score 5 to 25 at the time of admission) are recruited within 2 weeks of stroke onset. Participants must be able to perform voluntary respiratory maneuvers. Excluded are patients with increased <b>intracranial</b> pressure, uncontrolled <b>hypertension,</b> neuromuscular conditions other than stroke, medical history of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and recent cardiac events. Participants are randomized to receive inspiratory, expiratory, or sham respiratory training over a 4 -week period, by using commercially available threshold resistance devices. Participants and caregivers, but not study investigators, are blind to treatment allocation. All participants receive medical care and stroke rehabilitation according to the usual standard of care. The following assessments are conducted at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks: Voluntary and reflex cough flow measurements, forced spirometry, respiratory muscle strength tests, incidence of pneumonia, assessments of safety parameters, and self-reported activity of daily living. The primary outcome is peak expiratory cough flow of voluntary cough, a parameter indicating the effectiveness of cough. Secondary outcomes are incidence of pneumonia, peak expiratory cough flow of reflex cough, and maximum inspiratory and expiratory mouth pressures. DISCUSSION: Various novel pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches for preventing stroke-associated pneumonia are currently being researched. This study investigates a novel strategy based on an exercise intervention for cough rehabilitation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 40298220...|$|R
