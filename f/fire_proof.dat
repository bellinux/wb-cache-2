After Peter Rothwell's death on 2 August 1824, the company continued with Peter Rothwell Jr (1792–1849) as Rothwell, Hick & Co. They made stationary steam engines, (a number of which were featured by John Farey in the second volume of his Treatise on the Steam Engine, 1827) as well as general engineering products including cast iron dockyard cranes.

2500|$|In 1838 the Public Record Office Act {{was passed}} to [...] "keep safely the public records". Construction of the {{earliest}} {{part of the building}} seen today, the central wing, began in 1851. As a repository, it is claimed to be the first purpose-built fireproof building in England. To minimise the risk of fire the storerooms were designed as compartmentalised closed cells and the building had no heating. One of the cells which stored documents remains in its original condition, including its bookcases and <b>fire</b> <b>proof</b> slate shelves. Two search rooms were added in 1863 and a clock tower was built in 1865. In 1869–71 the building was extended along Fetter Lane, and in the 1890s two more wings designed by Sir John Taylor were added. At this time the medieval walls of the chapel were found to be unsound and had to be rebuilt. In 1902 the chapel became a museum of the Public Record Office. By 1997 all records were transferred to a new site in Kew or the Family Records Centre in Islington.|$|E

[...] Ornate cast iron rosettes hang from the building's cornice, and elegant glazed terra cotta panels cover the facade. [...] During its construction, the Times {{described it as a}} [...] "mammoth" [...] structure being built with the most massive steel girders and beams ever used on the West CoaStreet [...] The building, built from 3000 tons of steel, was the largest office in Los Angeles in 1911. [...] During its construction, hundreds of people lined the street [...] "to see the huge crane swinging these titanic metal units of the structural plan into place for the workmen with the air riveters." [...] Built by developer Robert A. Rowan, the Rowan Building once housed many of the city’s prominent law offices and stock brokerage firms. It has been known over the years as the Central <b>Fire</b> <b>Proof</b> Building Company and the Chester Building and has been converted into 206 live/work condominium units with retail space on the ground floor.

40|$|Abstract [...] The durable fire-retardants {{based on}} the {{colloidal}} solution of cationic aminotriazinealdehyde resin have been applied to HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper. The treatment is accomplished by soaking samples through an aqueous solution of these resins, drying and curing at room temperatures. The effect of kind of acids and of varying ratio of fire retardant components in treat-ing solution on the <b>fire</b> <b>proofing</b> efficiencies of HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper are discussed. Results are compared with those reported in previous paper 4 l and ammonium salts as fire retardant agents for wood, paper, fabrics and other combustible materials. Aminotria-zine-aldehyde condensation products combined with strong acids such as phosphoric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid and sulfamic acid imparted excellent fire resistance to wood and filter paper. Satisfactory <b>fire</b> <b>proofing</b> properties can be obtained in both HINOKI sliced veneer and filter paper at resin add-on as low as about 1 O~ 15 % with a few excep-tions. Total amount of resin required becomes lower as the melamine/acid ratio is de-creased...|$|R
