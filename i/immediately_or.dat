5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} was {{a common}} method of capital punishment in South and Southeast Asia, particularly in India, where Asian elephants were used to crush, dismember, or torture captives in public executions. The animals were trained and versatile, able to kill victims <b>immediately</b> <b>or</b> to torture them slowly over a prolonged period. Most commonly employed by royalty, the elephants were used to signify both the ruler's absolute power {{and his ability to}} control wild animals.|$|E
5|$|In most rodent species, such as brown {{rats and}} house mice, {{ovulation}} occurs {{on a regular}} cycle while in others, such as voles, it is induced by mating. During copulation, males of some rodent species deposit a mating plug in the female's genital opening, both to prevent sperm leakage and to protect against other males inseminating the female. Females can remove the plug and may do so either <b>immediately</b> <b>or</b> after several hours.|$|E

5|$|Kareena begins dating Mickey Miller (Joe Swash), but {{problems}} arise between them when Juley Smith (Joseph Kpobie) gives Kareena cocaine {{and she is}} seduced by him, though she manages to sort out her differences with Mickey eventually. Adi also has relationship problems after Sasha cheats on him with Danny Moon (Jake Maskall), leading to the couple's split. Gangster Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) agrees to loan several cars to the Ferreiras' business, but {{three of them are}} stolen and Johnny orders the family out of Walford <b>immediately</b> <b>or</b> face repercussions. Kareena initially opts to remain in Walford with Mickey, but at the last minute she changes her mind and departs with the rest of her family in March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, {{but that is not the}} case in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers <b>immediately</b> <b>or</b> within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|The high walk of crocodilians, {{with the}} belly {{and most of}} the tail being held off the ground, is unique among living reptiles. It {{somewhat}} resembles the walk of a mammal, with the same sequence of limb movements: left fore, right hind, right fore, left hind. The low walk is similar to the high walk, but without the body being raised, and {{is quite different from the}} sprawling walk of salamanders and lizards. The animal can change from one walk to the other instantaneously, but the high walk is the usual means of locomotion on land. The animal may push its body up and use this form <b>immediately,</b> <b>or</b> may take one or two strides of low walk before raising the body higher. Unlike most other land vertebrates, when crocodilians increase their pace of travel they increase the speed at which the lower half of each limb (rather than the whole leg) swings forward; by this means, stride length increases while stride duration decreases.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{the filing}} of the application, the Court may either make an order <b>immediately,</b> <b>or</b> direct that a summons for the order for review of {{detention}} be issued to enable all the parties involved to present arguments to the Court. If the latter course is taken, the ex parte originating summons, supporting affidavit, order of court and summons must be served on the person against whom the order is sought. Unless the Court directs otherwise, {{it is not necessary}} for the person under restraint to be brought before the Court for the hearing of the application. In addition, the Court may order that the person be released while the application is being heard. Once the Court decides to make an order for review of detention, it will direct when the person under restraint is to be brought before the court.|$|E
5|$|The 4th Light Horse Brigade (less the 4th Light Horse Regiment and two squadrons or five {{troops of}} 12th Light Horse Regiment) arrived at Beisan at 13:45 on 24 September. Here they {{received}} Order No. 31 from the Australian Mounted Division to attack Samakh. After leaving Beisan for Jisr el Mejamie, at 16:35 {{they received a}} message dropped from an aircraft, which reported that Samakh was defended by 50 rifles and machine guns. They arrived at Jisr el Mejamie at 21:00 and made contact with the regiment of the 4th Cavalry Division, holding the bridge. A further order to capture Samakh was received at 22:10, which included the additional objective of reconnoitring towards Tiberias, where they were {{to cooperate with the}} 3rd Light Horse Brigade in capturing the town. The orders gave the brigade commander, Brigadier General William Grant, the choice of attacking <b>immediately,</b> <b>or</b> waiting for the 4th Light Horse Regiment and the squadrons of the 12th Light Horse Regiment. He decided not to delay attacking the apparently weak rearguard, as he expected to be reinforced by the 15th Light Horse Regiment, 5th Light Horse Brigade, on the way to Samakh. If Grant had waited for reinforcements, the attack would have been during in daylight, {{in full view of the}} defenders in the railway station building, which may have resulted in at least as many casualties, and perhaps many more, during a potentially more protracted fight.|$|E
