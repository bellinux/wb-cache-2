5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> environment in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|Famine {{is shaped}} by {{generally}} two theories. The first is FAD, Food Availability Decline. This {{is the result of}} a drought, a war, or some other drastic change to the agricultural system. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> cause for famine. The other theory deals primarily with the population’s ability to access or become entitled to food. In this case, food power makes itself known on a small scale, as opposing political forces in Sudan compete for the votes of the people by instigating or encouraging the famine.|$|E

5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which {{is independent of}} protein synthesis, L-LTP requires gene transcription and protein synthesis in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both gene transcription and protein synthesis. These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E
5|$|The Rath is a {{landscaped}} {{street on}} high ground, with panoramic {{views of the}} Haven. The land {{was used in the}} 18th century as a gun battery, and its eastern edge was the site of the Royalist fort constructed by Charles I known as Pill Fort. In the 1930s it became the home of an outdoor swimming pool, which was converted into a water gardens in 1990.

The two pitches both have flood lighting, heating and are often used for matches by Rosenborg's recruit and reserve teams. The team has a health club located within the south stand. The club's offices are located in Brakka, a German-built barracks dating from World War II.|$|E
5|$|A {{classic example}} of a random walk {{is known as the}} simple random walk, which is a {{stochastic}} process in discrete time with the integers as the state space, and is based on a Bernoulli process, where each iid Bernoulli variable takes either the value positive one or negative one. In other words, the simple random walk takes place on the integers, and its value increases by one with probability, say, , or decreases by negative one with probability , so index set of this random walk <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> numbers, while its state space is the integers. If the , this random walk is called a symmetric random walk.|$|E

Sixty-two species of mammals and more than 112species of birds use Forest Park.
