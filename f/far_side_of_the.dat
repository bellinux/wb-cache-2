Lunar rock samples from the Apollo missions reveal that most lunar volcanism occurred around 3 to 4 billion years ago, but could have been as recent as 1 billion years ago due to the unknown history of the moon's far side.|$|E

5|$|United {{responded to}} the goal immediately, as Giggs made a surging run through the Barcelona defence before playing the ball to Berbatov in the inside-right channel. The Bulgarian forward's low cross found Giggs in the centre, and the United captain's shot was {{deflected}} to Ronaldo on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goal, only for the Portuguese's shot to be blocked by Valdés. The resulting corner reached Berbatov on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goal, but it was deemed to have crossed the goal line first and Barcelona were awarded a goal kick, from which they launched another attack. Messi played a through-ball to Puyol on the right flank, but as the Barcelona captain reached the goal line, he was fouled by Ronaldo, who – despite going in two-footed – escaped the referee's book. Puyol himself rose to head Xavi's free kick towards goal, but it was directly at Van der Sar, who claimed the ball easily.|$|E
5|$|A {{few weeks}} {{before the start of the}} {{services}} to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing in and out of the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge. Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.|$|E

5|$|Doppelgänger is a 1969 British {{science fiction}} film {{directed}} by Robert Parrish and starring Roy Thinnes, Ian Hendry, Lynn Loring and Patrick Wymark. Outside Europe, {{it is known}} as Journey to the <b>Far</b> <b>Side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, which is now the more popular title. In the film, a joint European-NASA mission to investigate a planet in a position parallel to Earth, behind the Sun, ends in disaster {{with the death of}} one of the astronauts (Hendry). His colleague (Thinnes) discovers that the planet is a mirror image of Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War-inspired Space Race {{between the}} Soviet Union and the U.S. {{led to an}} {{acceleration}} of interest in exploration of the Moon. Once launchers had the necessary capabilities, these nations sent unstaffed probes on both flyby and impact/lander missions. Spacecraft from the Soviet Union's Luna program {{were the first to}} accomplish a number of goals: following three unnamed, failed missions in 1958, the first human-made object to escape Earth's gravity and pass near the Moon was Luna 1; the first human-made object to impact the lunar surface was Luna 2, and the first photographs of the normally occluded <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon were made by Luna 3, all in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The {{absence of}} air makes outer space an ideal {{location}} for astronomy at all wavelengths {{of the electromagnetic}} spectrum. This {{is evidenced by the}} spectacular pictures sent back by the Hubble Space Telescope, allowing light from more than 13billion years ago—almost to the time of the Big Bang—to be observed. However, not every location in space is ideal for a telescope. The interplanetary zodiacal dust emits a diffuse near-infrared radiation that can mask the emission of faint sources such as extrasolar planets. Moving an infrared telescope out past the dust will increase the effectiveness of the instrument. Likewise, a site like the Daedalus crater on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon could shield a radio telescope from the radio frequency interference that hampers Earth-based observations.|$|E

5|$|The deities' ongoing battles prompt {{an alien}} race called the Aurum to invade Earth for its resources. In response, the warring deities strike a brief ceasefire and unite {{alongside}} the self-proclaimed Sun God Pyrrhon {{in order to}} fight the Aurum. However, Pyrrhon betrays the deities due to wanting to claim the Aurum's power and prove himself as the strongest god in existence, which leads to him being mentally controlled by the Aurum Brain. After Pit defeats the fusion of Pyrrhon and the Aurum Brain, Pyrrhon briefly comes to his senses and sacrifices himself to banish the Aurum to the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galaxy.|$|E
5|$|The islet in {{the left}} foreground, today known as Riddarholmen ("Knights' Islet"), was during the medieval era known as Gråmunkeholmen ("Greyfriars Islet") after the Franciscan monastery located there and in the {{painting}} represented as a building with stepped gables and a tall turret at the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> islet. Together with other similar institutions, the monastery was closed by the king following the Reformation although the building {{was used as a}} hospital until the mid 16th century. The turret of the monastery was replaced by the cast iron spire of Riddarholm Church in the 19th century, but the remains of the monastery still exist inside the church and under the surrounding buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{player is}} free to join {{any one of the}} servile groups and share common goals, or remain unaligned. Geneforge can be {{completed}} without joining any group. Trajkov can be killed through combat or tricked into killing himself by using the Geneforge. He can also be aided in activating the device, if the player steals the shaper gloves from Goettsch. Goettsch offers the player fake shaper gauntlets, which do not protect Trajkov from the Geneforge's energy should he be convinced they are genuine shaping gloves. The player can complete the game by using the last boat on Sucia Island. The small vessel is moored in a guarded dock on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island. Finishing the game unlocks one {{of more than a dozen}} game endings, dependent on the player's actions during the game.|$|E

5|$|The tower's gun {{installations}} {{were intended}} {{to be used to}} deal with an external threat approaching from the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river. The parapet of the roof was crenellated with nine wide embrasures, and the embrasures facing out across the river were constructed flush with the floor of the roof, giving the bombards plenty of room to fire. The embrasures facing away from the river, however, had sloping cills rather than open positions, and the windows in the tower facing towards the city were rectangular and relatively unprotected. The entrance to the tower itself was not fortified, as the tower was not expected to be defended from a direct attack by land.|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} at Holmewood {{he set up}} a 12½ inch reflector telescope at his home, which he kept into his old age. He developed a particular interest in the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Moon, a small part of which is visible from Earth {{as a result of the}} Moon's libration; the Moon was his specialist subject throughout his life. He claimed to have discovered and named the Mare Orientale (Eastern Sea) in 1946, along with Hugh Percy Wilkins, though he later conceded that German astronomer Julius Heinrich Franz should be credited with the discovery. The feature had been observed several times since telescopic observations began. Moore described the short-lived glowing areas on the lunar surface, and gave them the name transient lunar phenomena in 1968.|$|E
5|$|With Norfolk and its navy yard in Portsmouth, the Confederacy {{controlled}} the southern side of Hampton Roads. To prevent Union warships from attacking the yard, the Confederates set up batteries at Sewell's Point and Craney Island, at the juncture of the Elizabeth River with the James. (See map.) The Union retained possession of Fort Monroe, at Old Point Comfort on the Virginia Peninsula. They also held a small man-made island {{known as the}} Rip Raps, on the <b>far</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> channel opposite Fort Monroe, and on this island they completed another fort, named Fort Wool. With Fort Monroe went control of the lower Peninsula as far as Newport News.|$|E
