5000|$|The Turkmen {{alphabet}} {{used for}} official purposes in Turkmenistan is a Latin alphabet {{based on the}} Turkish alphabet, but with notable differences: J is used <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> Turkish C; W is used <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> Turkish V; Ž is used <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> Turkish J; Y is used <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> dotless i (I/ı); Ý is used <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> Turkish consonantal Y; and the letters Ä and Ň {{have been added to}} represent the phonetic values [...] and , respectively.|$|R
5000|$|BTR-50PM (palawa modification) - Version {{used by the}} Indonesian marines (Marinir), {{fitted with}} AN/VRC-64 and PRC-33 radios <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> 10-RT, new brake system, FN MAG machine gun <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> PKT and a Detroit Diesel 6V92T engine <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> {{original}} V-6V.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{conversion}} errors, mathematical symbols {{have been}} replaced by numbers or incorrect symbols. The following errors occur in the legend to Fig. 1 and in footnote 2 on page 294 and in the first and third paragraphs of page 296 : The numeral 2 appears <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> multiplication sign, <b>the</b> numeral 4 <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> equals sign, <b>the</b> quotation mark <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> {{greater than or equal to}} sign, and <b>the</b> plus sign <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> less than sign.

5|$|The {{interchange}} {{between the}} QEW and Lundy's Lane (Highway20) was also removed; <b>instead,</b> <b>the</b> new stack interchange included access to Montrose Road.|$|E
5|$|A {{technical}} director worked out {{that to make}} Carl's house fly, he would require 23million balloons, but Docter realized that number made the balloons look like small dots. <b>Instead,</b> <b>the</b> balloons created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,927balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.|$|E
5|$|Above each stall, the occupant's heraldic {{devices are}} displayed. Perched on the {{pinnacle}} of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; <b>instead,</b> <b>the</b> coronet appropriate to the dame's rank (if she is a peer or member of the Royal family) is used.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, only 11 out of 13 of the {{proposed}} simplification were successful as people continued to use ஐ <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> proposed அய் and ஔ <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> proposed அவ்.|$|R
50|$|First, because 24 teams compete <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> 16 that {{compete in}} all other series events, the Hong Kong Sevens is divided into six pools <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> normal four.|$|R
50|$|In the Gregorian {{calendar}} (a common solar calendar), February in a {{leap year}} has 29 days <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> usual 28, so the year lasts 366 days <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> usual 365.|$|R
5|$|After the season, {{the owners}} asked the NHL {{for a second}} time for {{permission}} to suspend operations. This time, the NHL refused the request. <b>Instead,</b> <b>the</b> league bought back the franchise, halted its operations, and dispersed its players among the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|Also on November 28, 2006, a 14-disc DVD box set titled Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition was released, {{containing}} Superman, Superman II, , Superman III, Superman IV, Superman Returns, and , {{among other}} releases. All {{contents of the}} set were housed within a tin case. The set was valued at US$99.92, and received extremely positive reviews when first released. However, after only {{a day on the}} market, Warner Bros. announced that there were two errors discovered within the set. The first was that the 2.0 audio track on Superman, was <b>instead</b> <b>the</b> 5.1 audio track already on the disc. The second was that the Superman III disc was not the 2006 deluxe edition as advertised, but the 2001 release <b>instead.</b> <b>The</b> set was soon recalled, and Warner Bros. offered a toll-free number to replace the faulty discs for people who had already purchased the set. Due to popular demand, a corrected set was released and Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition returned to store shelves on May 29, 2007.|$|E
5|$|Although many fires {{likewise}} burnt {{following the}} bombing, {{in contrast to}} Hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available, no firestorm developed in Nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough fuel to generate the phenomenon. <b>Instead,</b> <b>the</b> ambient wind at the time pushed the fire spread along the valley.|$|E
5000|$|The person {{outside the}} circle to last touch the ball becomes it <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> last thrower. This {{is often used}} so {{that the person who}} failed to catch the ball is it <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> thrower.|$|R
5000|$|...The sleeve {{lists the}} running time of 4.26 <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> UK's 3.25, and {{includes}} the beatmasters remix {{of the track}} as found on <b>the</b> Greasemania album, <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> normal track, which appears on the UK single.|$|R
5000|$|... (The album’s {{original}} 1981 release featured {{only the}} parodied “Beatles” names <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> members’ real names, which were <b>instead</b> featured on <b>the</b> 1995 remastered CD release.) ...|$|R
5|$|Andretti {{was also}} {{considered}} as a replacement, again for Tambay who had been injured in Canada, at the 1986 Detroit Grand Prix, this time for the Carl Haas owned Haas Lola team. Mario declined however, but recommended his son Michael Andretti for the drive. Unfortunately for Michael {{he was unable to}} obtain the FIA Superlicense required to allow him to race in Formula One. <b>Instead</b> <b>the</b> drive went to Eddie Cheever.|$|E
5|$|As stated above, {{a portion}} of M-32 {{is not on the}} NHS. <b>Instead,</b> <b>the</b> Federal Highway Administration map for the NHS in Michigan shows a {{proposed}} realignment that has not been built as of 2008.|$|E
5|$|At {{the bottom}} of the hill beside the battery are two {{rectangular}} earthworks, 16 metres by 8 metres (52ft and 26ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85ft and 39ft). Traditionally these have been thought to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but recent scholarship casts doubt on this, suggesting that they are <b>instead</b> <b>the</b> remains of hollow ways and sand pits.|$|E
30|$|Note {{that we can}} use 1 -α_n < α_n, for n large enough, <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> {{condition}} 1 -α_n < α_n, for all n≥ 0. One can use {{similar conditions}} <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> conditions which we will use in our results.|$|R
30|$|We {{improve and}} extend Theorem  3.1 of Jitsupa et al. [1]. Especially, we use <b>the</b> Lipschitzian <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> contraction, and {{also use the}} η-strongly {{monotone}} and K-Lipschitzian operator <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> strong positive linear bounded operator to construct our iteration process.|$|R
50|$|Also {{because of}} the {{expanded}} number of teams, the points system for this tournament is also different. Most significantly, the winning team picks up 30 points <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> normal 20, and the runner-up earns 24 points <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> normal 16.|$|R
5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not help to subdue the French uprising. <b>Instead,</b> <b>the</b> German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E
5|$|Birdwood {{planned to}} arrive off the {{peninsula}} after the moon had set, {{with the first}} troops landing at 03:30, an hour before dawn. He declined the offer of an old merchant ship, loaded with troops, being deliberately grounded at Gaba Tepe. <b>Instead,</b> <b>the</b> troops were to travel in naval and merchant ships, transferring to rowing boats towed by small steamboats to make the assault.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{initially}} {{wanted to}} nominate Thomas to replace William Brennan, who stepped down in 1990, but he then decided that Thomas {{had not yet}} had enough experience as a judge after only months on the federal bench. Bush therefore nominated New Hampshire Supreme Court judge David Souter <b>instead.</b> <b>The</b> selection of Thomas to instead replace Marshall preserved the existing racial composition of the court.|$|E
25|$|Con Sciacca was in {{fact the}} member for the seat of Bowman, which had become Liberal in a redistribution; he <b>instead</b> contested <b>the</b> new seat of Bonner.

50|$|Paradoxically, the North East of England came <b>instead</b> under <b>the</b> Northern Gas Board.

50|$|The front had {{vertical}} corners <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> normal Celica's sloping park lights (indicator {{lights in}} some markets). The bonnet was also extended forward to match. An unusual grill was used featuring large round holes <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> more common slats or hexagonal holes.|$|R
5|$|By the 17th century, {{coastal erosion}} had {{undermined}} the castle's walls. In 1627, Charles I {{announced that he}} would repair the fortification but <b>instead</b> <b>the</b> ruins were dismantled in 1631 by Sir John Oglander. A new fortification, Sandown Fort was built in its place, positioned further inland, but the possible remains of the foundations of the original castle are still visible along the shore at low tide.|$|E
5|$|Chase assumed {{command of}} the 1st Cavalry Division on 1 August 1945.

It embarked from Batangas on 25 August and disembarked in Tokyo Bay on 2 September, becoming the first US division in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Consequently, Tătărescu renounced his offices {{inside the}} party, and, while keeping his office of general secretary, he was surpassed by the readmitted Gheorghe I. Brătianu — {{who was elected}} to the new office of PNL vice {{president}} on 10 January 1938. After the failure of Goga's policies to curb the rise of their competitors, the king, backed by Tătărescu, resorted to dissolving all political parties on 30 May 1938, creating <b>instead</b> <b>the</b> National Renaissance Front.|$|E

5000|$|Another early {{experience}} with bundled payments occurred between 1987 and 1989, involving an orthopedic surgeon, a hospital (Ingham Regional Medical Center), and a {{health maintenance organization}} (HMO) in Michigan. The HMO referred 111 patients to the surgeon for possible surgery; the surgeon would evaluate each patient for free. The surgeon and the hospital received a predetermined fee for any arthroscopic surgery performed, but they also provided a two-year warranty in that they promised to cover any post-surgery expenses (for example, four re-operations) <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> HMO. Under this arrangement, [...] "all parties benefitted financially": the HMO paid $193,000 <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> $318,538 expected; the hospital received $96,500 <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> $84,892 expected; and the surgeon and his associates received $96,500 <b>instead</b> of <b>the</b> $51,877 expected.|$|R
