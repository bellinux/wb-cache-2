5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging functional disturbance, including erethism, irritability, excitability, <b>excessive</b> <b>shyness,</b> and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E

6000|$|They often select {{an exposed}} weed to feed on, {{clustering}} together on its summit above the surrounding verdure, an exceedingly conspicuous object to every {{eye in the}} neighbourhood. They also frequently change their feeding-ground; at such times they deliberately cross wide roads and other open spaces, barren of grass, where, moving so slowly that they scarcely seem to move at all, they look at a distance {{like a piece of}} black velvet lying on the ground. Thus in every imaginable way they expose themselves and invite attack; yet, in spite of it all, I have never detected birds preying on them, and I have sometimes kept one of these black societies under observation near my house for several days, watching them at intervals, in places where the trees overhead were the resort of Icterine and tyrant birds, Guira cuckoos, and other species, all great hunters after grasshoppers. A young grasshopper is, moreover, a morsel that seldom comes amiss to any bird, whether insect or seed eater; and, as a rule, it is extremely shy, nimble, and inconspicuous. It seems clear that, although the young Zoniopoda does not mimic in its form any black protected insect, it nevertheless owes its safety to its blackness, together with the habit it possesses of exposing itself in so open and bold a manner. Blackness is so common in large protected insects, as, for instance, in the un-palatable leaf-cutting ants, scorpions, mygale spiders, wasps, and other dangerous kinds, that it is manifestly a [...] "warning colour," [...] the most universal and best known in nature; and the grasshopper, I believe, furthermore mimics the fearless demeanour of the protected or venomous species, which birds and other insect-eaters know and respect. It might be supposed that the young Zoniopoda is itself unpalatable; but this is scarcely probable, for when the deceptive black mask is once dropped, the <b>excessive</b> <b>shyness,</b> love of concealment, and protective colouring of the insect show that it is much sought after by birds.|$|E

40|$|During {{adolescence}} numerous {{of important}} social abilities are acquired within interactions with peers. Severe psychiatric disorders {{interfere with the}} acquisition of these social skills. For example, due to <b>excessive</b> <b>shyness,</b> adolescents with psychiatric disorders may not experiment positive social interactions. Social skills training (SKT) may help adolescents to remediate to these diffi culties. This exploratory study aims to assess the SKT's effect on assertivity, in a population of adolescents presenting psychiatric disorder and attending a day care unit for adolescents. The SKT, delivered in group, deals with different themes such as contact, conversation, problem solving, confl ict, fail, success, learning, effort, separation, breakdown, and project. In this context, 38 adolescents (19 suffering from anxiety / mood disorder and 19 suffering from psychotic disorder) rate their level of assertivity before and after a SKT with the Rathus assertivity scale. This scale allows to differentiate between inhibited, assertive and assertiveaggressive adolescents. Results showed a general improvement on assertivity after the SKT. More specifi cally, adolescents suffering from anxiety disorder and the 'inhibited' adolescents showed the higher benefi t from the SKT. Thus, two hours per week of SKT seems to enhance social abilities in a population with severe psychiatric disorders. More specifi - cally, adolescents with anxiety / mood disorders reported more benefi ts of the SKT on their assertivity. Nevertheless, adolescents with psychotic disorders did not report strong benefi ts from the SKT despite the improvement observed at a clinical level. This observation {{raises questions about the}} usefulness of self-reported questionnaire to measure such benefi t for adolescents with psychosis...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Este artigo revisa aspectos relevantes da fobia social e os estágios de tratamento através da terapia cognitivo-comportamental em crianças, adolescentes e adultos. MÉTODO: A partir do banco de dados Medline, realizou-se revisão da {{literatura}} publicada a respeito do tratamento da fobia social por meio da terapia cognitivo-comportamental. RESULTADOS: Revisão da literatura sugere que a fobia social é uma condição prevalente e crônica, caracterizada por inibição social e timidez excessiva. Tanto o diagnóstico como o tratamento desse transtorno são comumente determinados pelo nível de incômodo e pelo prejuízo funcional. Estudos populacionais indicam taxas de prevalência ao longo da vida para a fobia social entre 2, 5 e 13, 3 %. As principais técnicas utilizadas na terapia cognitivo-comportamental para a fobia social são descritas e exemplificadas em um relato de caso. CONCLUSÕES: Há consenso geral na literatura de que a terapia cognitivo-comportamental é eficaz tanto para o tratamento de jovens como de adultos com fobia social. Uma vez que a fobia social com freqüência tem início precoce, a identificação de crianças com risco acentuado para o desenvolvimento de fobia social deve ser priorizada em investigações futuras. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews relevant {{aspects of}} social phobia and {{the stages of}} treatment within cognitive-behavioral therapy in children and adolescents, {{as well as in}} adults. METHOD: A review of the literature published on the treatment of social phobia using cognitive-behavioral treatments was performed using the Medline database. RESULTS: A review of the literature suggests that social phobia is a chronic and prevalent condition, characterized by social inhibition and <b>excessive</b> <b>shyness.</b> Diagnosis and treatment of the disorder are usually determined by distress level and functional impairment. Population studies indicate that lifetime prevalence rates for social phobia range from 2. 5 to 13. 3 %. The main techniques used in cognitive-behavioral therapy for social phobia are described and exemplified in a case report. CONCLUSIONS: There is a general consensus in the literature that cognitive-behavioral therapy is efficacious in the treatment of youth and adults with social phobia. Because of the early onset associated with social phobia, the identification of children at high risk for the development of social phobia should be prioritized in future investigations...|$|E
40|$|Rationale/statement of {{the problem}} : In the central nervous system, the {{serotonin}} (5 HT) neurotransmitter system {{plays a key role}} in the regulation of mood and emotion. Alterations in the 5 HT system are thought to contribute to psychopathologies. In addition, drugs targeting the 5 HT system are effective in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Children with anxious temperament (AT) are characterized by <b>excessive</b> <b>shyness,</b> worrying, and avoidant behavior. This temperament, when stable across development, increases the risk of later developing depression and anxiety disorders. Using a well-established, nonhuman primate model of AT, we tested whether variations in the 5 HT system predict individual differences in AT. We focused on the central nucleus region of the amygdala (CeA) because we have established that metabolic activity in this region is predictive of AT. Methods : Using Affymetrix GeneChip&#x 00 AE; rhesus macaque genome arrays, we assessed gene expression from CeA tissue in 24 young male rhesus monkeys phenotyped for AT. Robust regression analysis was performed with correction for multiple comparisons across all annotated transcripts that are part of the neuroactive ligand pathway (KO 04080) in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Results : As hypothesized, variation in gene expression predicted individual differences in AT. Specifically, of the thirteen 5 HT receptors assessed, only the 5 HT 2 C receptor (5 HT 2 C; r=&#x 200 A;&#x 2212;&#x 200 A; 0. 57, p&# 60; 0. 01) was identified in the microarray analysis as significantly negatively correlated with AT. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis using the same CeA RNA samples confirmed this association (r&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A;&#x 2212; 0. 65, p&# 60; 0. 001). Underscoring the anatomical specificity of this effect, the significant relationship between 5 HT 2 C receptor mRNA levels and AT was not observed in the motor cortex, a brain region not associated with AT (r= 0. 10, p= 0. 64). Conclusions : Previous work by others has shown robust levels of 5 HT 2 C receptor mRNA and radioligand binding in the monkey CeA. In addition, rodent models have indicated a role for the 5 HT 2 C receptor in anxiety-like responding. Our findings suggest that higher levels of 5 HT 2 C receptor gene expression are associated with lower levels of AT. Increased expression of the gene encoding for this receptor may facilitate 5 HT signaling in the amygdala thereby promoting adaptive responses and resilience to potentially anxiety provoking situations...|$|E
