5|$|After September 1939, desperate {{efforts were}} made to improve the situation, but with very little result. Germany, for obvious reasons, delayed its deliveries; France was {{hesitant}} to <b>equip</b> an army that would not unequivocally take its side. The one abundant source of readily available weaponry, the Soviet Union, was inaccessible because the Dutch, contrary to most other nations, did not recognise the communist regime. An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed.|$|E

Yellow pads <b>equip</b> the player with {{offensive}} weaponry to destroy other racers and green pads provide defensive weapons such as mines, shields and speed boosts. Game modes carried over from Wipeout HD include one-on-one races, tournaments, time trials, speed laps, and Zone mode. The latter mode revolves around survival as the player's ship automatically accelerates to extreme speeds.|$|E

The helicopters {{to be used in}} the raid had been designed to be quiet and to have low radar visibility. Since the U.S. had helped <b>equip</b> and train the Pakistanis, their defensive capabilities were known.

These {{were followed by}} a series of increasingly mammoth weapons—guns weighing 12, 25, 25, 38 and finally 81tons, with calibre increasing from 8-inch (203mm) to 16-inch (406mm).|$|E
