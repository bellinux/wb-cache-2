60|$|But {{when many}} years had rolled away Santa Claus grew old. The long beard of golden brown that once covered {{his cheeks and}} chin {{gradually}} became gray, and finally turned to pure white. His hair was white, too, and there were wrinkles {{at the corners of}} his eyes, which showed plainly when he laughed. He had never been a very tall man, and now <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>fat,</b> and waddled very much like a duck when he walked. But in spite of these things he remained as lively as ever, and was just as jolly and gay, and his kind eyes sparkled as brightly as they did that first day when he came to the Laughing Valley.|$|E
5000|$|The writers {{wanted the}} title of the episode to make Homer sound proud about his weight, so they decided to name it [...] "King-Size Homer". Greaney really enjoyed working on the episode because Homer is {{constantly}} happy and goal oriented in it, instead of being a slob who is [...] "eating all the time". Animator David Silverman designed the obese Homer for the episode. There was a discussion about what Homer would wear when <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>fat,</b> and they decided to go with a muumuu. The writers were also discussing about how they were going to treat Homer's obesity. They did not want Homer to come off as a [...] "hog", so they decided that the viewer should barely see him eating after he reaches his 300 pounds goal. As the writers were trying {{to figure out a way}} to get Homer back to his old weight by the end of the episode, it was suggested that Homer should feel bad about his obesity, and therefore become thin for Marge, but that idea was scrapped in early production. Action figurines based on obese Homer were made for the World of Springfield series shortly after the episode had aired.|$|E
50|$|A {{year later}} his record faded again. He rarely {{finished}} races and shone only in round-the-houses races, where his contract fees {{were needed to}} pay his tax debts. He did not defend his title in the 1982 world championship at Goodwood, saying he had injured his knee on a gate. <b>He</b> <b>became</b> <b>fatter</b> and rode for small teams for equally small salaries.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fat one" [...] was Felix, who {{was very}} {{sensitive}} about his plumpness. He was always taking exercises to make him thin, with the dismal result that <b>he</b> <b>became</b> <b>fatter</b> all the time. He vowed that he didn't care; but he DID care terribly, and he glowered at Mrs. MacLaren in a most undutiful fashion. He had never liked her since the day {{she had told him}} he would soon be as broad as he was long.|$|R
50|$|After leaving HMV, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> {{chairman}} of <b>Fat</b> Face, the active lifestyle retailer.|$|R
60|$|Maud shivered again. He {{thought he}} had put on a little weight, and didn't know if she had noticed it! She was oppressed by the eternal melancholy miracle of the fat man who does not realize that <b>he</b> has <b>become</b> <b>fat.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to Gibson, [...] "in {{his later}} days <b>he</b> <b>became</b> so <b>fat</b> <b>he</b> {{was unable to}} walk". The exact date of his death in late 1872 is unclear, as it was kept secret to secure a smooth {{transition}} of power to Cetshwayo.|$|R
50|$|Tiddles, {{also known}} as the Paddington Station cat, (1970 - 1983) was a tabby-and-white cat who {{spent most of his life}} in the ladies' room at Paddington Station, in London. Constantly fed choice meats, {{including}} titbits from his admirers, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> famously <b>fat.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{the bargain}} was struck, and Antonio agreed {{to become the}} ogre's servant. He was very well treated, in every way, and he {{had little or no}} work to do, with the result that in a few days <b>he</b> <b>became</b> as <b>fat</b> as a quail, as round as a barrel, as red as a lobster, and as impudent as a bantam-cock.|$|R
5000|$|Gorge - The Pig Imp. He has {{the ability}} to turn ground to mud (a trick he used on Reekon, Lexor and Feryl) and can also cause pigs to stampede. His biggest {{weakness}} is his inability to see food without helping himself to it - the Visionaries later exploited this by tricking him into stuffing himself with cake until <b>he</b> <b>became</b> too <b>fat</b> to stand. Named Glutton in the original script. (Voiced by Peter Cullen) ...|$|R
50|$|Bill visits {{his uncle}} Crispin {{who is a}} {{mushroom}} picker of such skill he can hear the mushrooms popping up from the ground. However Old Crispin is growing unhappy and is taken ill. He is sent on a holiday but that doesn't help. His wife tries to feed him but he refuses, however one day she feeds him jelly which he devours with gusto and he eats so much <b>he</b> <b>becomes</b> too <b>fat</b> to pick mushrooms.|$|R
60|$|Whitefoot the Wood Mouse {{should have}} been happy, but he wasn't. Winter had gone and sweet Mistress Spring had brought joy to all the Green Forest. Every one was happy, Whitefoot no less so than his neighbors at first. Up from the Sunny South came the {{feathered}} friends and at once began planning new homes. Twitterings and songs filled the air. Joy was everywhere. Food became plentiful, and Whitefoot <b>became</b> sleek and <b>fat.</b> That is, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> as <b>fat</b> as a lively Wood Mouse ever does become. None of his enemies had discovered his new home, and he had little to worry about.|$|R
50|$|The Fat Controller (real name Sir Topham Hatt) is {{the head}} of the railway in The Railway Series of books written by the Rev. W. V. Awdry. In the first two books in the series (The Three Railway Engines and Thomas the Tank Engine) he is known as the Fat Director. In the third book (James the Red Engine) <b>he</b> <b>becomes</b> The <b>Fat</b> Controller, as the railway has been nationalised. His full name is {{revealed}} in the foreword to the book Henry the Green Engine.|$|R
50|$|About {{ten years}} later, Anna (Vanessa Brown) returns with her fiancé, a Royal Navy lieutenant. In {{the course of}} a {{conversation}} with her mother, Anna reveals that Captain Gregg's ghost was her childhood companion during the same year Lucy and the Captain were acquainted. She also knew about her mother's relationship with Miles Fairley all the time, rekindling faint memories in her mother of the Captain. It is also revealed that Fate has not been kind to Fairley; <b>he</b> has <b>become</b> <b>fat,</b> bald and a heavy drinker, and his wife and children have finally left him.|$|R
2500|$|Baptiste-Pierre-François Bisson (16 February 1767 at Montpellier, France [...] 26 July 1811, at Mantua in the Kingdom of Italy) {{joined the}} French army and rose rapidly in rank during the French Revolutionary Wars. He {{served as a}} {{division}} commander in the Grande Armée of Emperor Napoleon in 1805 and 1807, playing a leading role at the Battle of Friedland. He was captured by Tyrolean rebels in 1809. Known as a gourmand, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> very <b>fat</b> before dying prematurely. His surname {{is one of the}} Names inscribed under the Arc de Triomphe.|$|R
500|$|No {{authentic}} {{portrait of}} William has been found; the contemporary depictions {{of him on}} the Bayeux Tapestry and on his seals and coins are conventional representations designed to assert his authority. There are some written descriptions of a burly and robust appearance, with a guttural voice. He enjoyed excellent health until old age, although <b>he</b> <b>became</b> quite <b>fat</b> in later life. He {{was strong enough to}} draw bows that others were unable to pull and had great stamina. Geoffrey Martel described him as without equal as a fighter and as a horseman. Examination of William's femur, the only bone to survive when the rest of his remains were destroyed, showed he was approximately [...] in height.|$|R
5000|$|A new trailer was added, {{with less}} {{disturbing}} scenes. In September 2012, the channel launched [...] "Oishi Origins", a three-episode prequel to Oishi High School Battle. The show replacing Samurai! Daycare is Icons of Teen, which features both fictional characters (such as Batman and Spock) and real celebrities (such as Oprah Winfrey) as teenagers. Also that week, [...] "Oishi Origins" [...] {{was replaced by}} [...] "Teleporting Fat Guy", {{which is based on}} a character from previous Smosh videos and explains how <b>he</b> <b>became</b> the Teleporting <b>Fat</b> Guy.|$|R
50|$|In Il mattino Parini {{writes about}} the {{beginning}} of a young man's day. It begins with his waking up and continues with the breakfast and the choice of it. The young man can choose between several drinks, from chocolate (if he needs to digest the dinner of the last night) to coffee (if <b>he</b> tends to <b>become</b> <b>fat).</b> It continues with some welcome and unwelcome meetings, the toeletta and the reading of some letters. Then he gets out to meet his lady (aristocratic ladies of this period of time had both a husband and a gallant, called a cicisbeo, to pass the day with).|$|R
2500|$|In 1807, {{despite his}} earlier {{affiliation}} with Marie Antoinette, Dussek returned to Paris in the employ of Talleyrand, the powerful French foreign minister. [...] Having no doubt made the acquaintance of Sébastien Érard in London, <b>he</b> <b>became</b> {{closely associated with}} the Érard brothers' piano-making activities, signing an Érard grand piano of 1808 still to be seen at Talleyrand's château at Valençay and giving the first public performance on their new stirrup-action grand in 1810. He wrote a powerful sonata (Sonata in A flat major, Op. 64, C 221) called Le Retour à Paris (The Return to Paris). This imposing sonata also received the nickname Plus Ultra in heated response to a piano sonata by Joseph Woelfl, said to be the last word in pianistic difficulties, entitled Ne Plus Ultra. The remainder of his life he spent performing, teaching and composing in Prussia and France. His personal beauty had faded and <b>he</b> <b>became</b> grossly <b>fat,</b> so much so that he had a curve cut into his dining table and was eventually unable to reach the piano keyboard. He also developed a fondness for strong drink which probably hastened his death. Dussek died on March 20, 1812, in Saint-Germain-en-Laye.|$|R
50|$|He {{is drawn}} to look very similar to his father, though less bulky. Due to the {{contrast}} between their personalities, {{he also has a}} far more genial appearance to his face. Throughout the series and movies <b>he</b> <b>becomes</b> increasingly larger in size, although he does not actually <b>become</b> <b>fatter.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{the reign}} of Henry VIII {{clothing}} was an increasingly important part of court life. Maria Hayward explains howimportant {{it was for the}} King to dress the part, through making contacts with merchants and spending lavishly on new, luxury textiles. To maintain his place at the forefront of society and style, Henry was supported by the King's tailor and the office of the Great Wardrobe. The author makes the point that Henry was eminently suited to leading fashion while he was young and fit but that this was harder when <b>he</b> <b>became</b> older and <b>fatter.</b> The fascinating relationship between Henry's clothing and armour is explored; both were essentail in creating an image of magnificence. Today much of his armour survives, but sadly his costume does not...|$|R
60|$|I do {{not know}} that this kind of life had been {{altogether}} successful with them, or that their father had been right to permit it. He himself had formerly been a hunting man, but <b>he</b> had <b>become</b> <b>fat</b> and lazy, and the thing had dropped away from him. Occasionally he did come out with them, but when he did not do so some other senior of the field would have them nominally under charge; but practically they were as independent when going across the country as the young men who accompanied them. I have expressed a doubt whether this life was successful with them, and indeed such doubt was expressed by many of their neighbours. It had been said of each of them {{for the last three years}} that she was engaged, now to this man, and then to that other; but neither this man nor that other had yet made good the assertion, and now people were beginning to say that no man was engaged to either of them. Hunting young ladies are very popular in the hunting-field; I know no place in which girls receive more worship and attention; but I am not sure but they may carry their enthusiasm too far for their own interests, let their horsemanship be as perfect as it may be.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, {{he started}} to gain weight, and {{eventually}} reached 102 kilograms. <b>He</b> <b>became</b> a charming <b>fat</b> man, wearing silver tights and boots instead of the gakuran pants worn {{by the rest of}} the Tozawa-juku unit, and it resulted in a big increase of his popularity. When it surpassed Tozawa's, it caused Tozawa to begin a similar weight gain program. They began to team together as the Metabolic Brothers within Tozawa-juku, but the team found no success. Ono was derailed by injuries, and the gimmick, despite having worked well for Ono previously, did not get over with the fans. On July 11, 2008, the team came to an end when Tozawa announced his intentions to go on a diet. He asked Ono to lose weight as well, but Ono refused and vowed to balloon up to 170 kilograms.|$|R
50|$|Ja'far, now trapped {{within the}} lamp forever, resigns {{himself to his}} fate when he is {{suddenly}} greeted by Scheherazade. Reincarnated {{as a result of}} the Princess' last wish, Scheherazade tells Ja'far that she can stay in the lamp with him forever. Because the inside of the lamp exists outside time and space (explaining how the Djinn was able to watch and quote movies centuries before they were made), Scheherazade can also look into the future. She reveals that the Princess brought about the third golden age of the Magic Kingdom and followed the Golden Rule by making everyone a princess. Additionally, Ja'far learns that Aladdin has an ignominious future where <b>he</b> <b>becomes</b> old and <b>fat,</b> making a living by selling second-hand goods, until he is killed by a thief for a loaf of bread at age 55. Ja'far asks how their story ends, to which Scheherazade replies that it doesn't, and they kiss ("Finale / A Thousand And One Nights Reprise").|$|R
5000|$|At {{that time}} there died Ishoyahb III, the catholicus of the Nestorians, who was succeeded at Seleucia by his disciple Giwargis. He made {{a tour of}} the regions, anxious to restore ecclesiastical matters, while his enemies accused him to the emir of the Arabs of touring the regions to collect money. The emir {{therefore}} demanded money from him, and when he refused to give it, and did not give it even after suffering torture and imprisonment, the indignant emir destroyed many churches at Aqula and throughout the region of Hirta. In the time of Giwargis the doctor Yohannan, bishop of Beth Waziq, cut off his members after he was accused of fornication, and was then condemned all the more and deposed.Also of his time, John bar Penkaye wrote:"This period of calm was to us the cause of so much weakness, that there happened to us what happened to the Israelites, of whom it is said: “Israel has grown fat and lazy, <b>he</b> has <b>become</b> <b>fat</b> and wealthy, <b>he</b> has abandoned the God who made him, and despised the strong one that saved him.” The westerners, it is true, clung tightly to their sacrilegious (faith), but we who believe we adhere to the true faith, we were so far from the works of Christians, that if one of the former had risen and had seen us, he would have had been dizzy and said: “this is not the faith in which I died.”"Bar Penkaye specifically hits [...] "the leaders" [...] under Muawiyah - which can only be Giwargis - for arrogance, for greed, for gluttony, for involvement in politics, and for bribing the secular authorities (also applicable to Ishoyahb III).|$|R

5000|$|S.mouse {{decides to}} create his own music for his new album, The Real Me. The album will be {{released}} independently and is executively produced by his best friend Danthony (Clyde Boraine). S.mouse had originally planned to feature Barbadian singer Rihanna on his new song, [...] "Big Black Balls", however it features his girlfriend Lasquisha (Kristin Dione Metoyer) instead. S.mouse completes his community service by performing his new songs to an unimpressed audience of children at an elementary school. Lasquisha tells him that they don't know him and he'll already be forgotten once his house arrest is over. S.mouse goes to the mall, {{even though he is}} not allowed to leave the house, to prove that he is still famous. However, no one cares that he is there and when Lasquisha asks people if they know him, they say no. When they arrive home, a parole officer tightens the security on S.mouse's ankle monitor. If he walks out the gate, he will be electrocuted. S.mouse spends the afternoon writing a new song called [...] "Whack My Knee" [...] and Lasquisha comes up with a dance craze for the song. During a photo shoot for his new album, The Real Me, a paparazzi helicopter secretly takes photos of S.mouse shirtless and puts them online, claiming that <b>he</b> has <b>become</b> <b>fat.</b> S.mouse later finds out that Lasquisha has dumped him, as she {{does not want to be}} associated with someone believed to be fat. S.mouse launches his new album at a club in Los Angeles to a crowd who are less than pleased. He writes a new song called [...] "Squashed Nigga", based on Daniel's story about an Aborigine child named Wally who was crushed by a truck. S.mouse decides to sing the song instead of rapping the lyrics. He subsequently re-invents himself under the performing name of: Shwayne Jr.|$|R
