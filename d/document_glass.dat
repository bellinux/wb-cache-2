40|$|The {{use of a}} {{conventional}} flatbed scanner {{as a means to}} assess the optical properties of multicrystalline silicon wafers after texturization has been explored. It was found {{that it is necessary to}} i introduce an additional diffusor between the wafer under test and the scanner s <b>document</b> <b>glass,</b> and b to obtain scans in four perpendicular directions of the wafer. Averaging over the four scans gives a reflectivity map with a resolution of 0. 1 x 0. 1 mm 2. It is shown that the map can be calibrated to yield a spatially resolved image of the effective reflectivity of the wafer, with an accuracy of about 1. Furthermore, the difference image of two scans in different directions contains additional information on the directional dependence of reflectivity. It is envisaged that in combination with etching procedures that are selective to grain orientation, the information contained in the difference images can be used to obtain grain orientation maps similar to EBSD pictures. Acquisition and processing times are of the images are below one minute, and equipment cost a few 100, making the technique suitable both for rapid prototyping in the lab and for process control in productio...|$|E

40|$|Earlier {{literature}} on the gender pay gap has taught us that occupations matter and so do firms. However, {{the role of the}} firm has received little scrutiny; occupations have most often been coded in a rather aggregate way, lumping together different jobs; and the use of samples of workers prevents any reliable determination of either the extent of segregation or the relative importance of access to firms versus occupations. Our contribution is twofold. We provide a clear measure {{of the impact of the}} allocation of workers to firms and to job titles shaping the gender pay gap. We also provide a methodological contribution that combines the estimation of sets of high-dimensional fixed effects and Gelbach's (2009) unambiguous decomposition of the conditional gap. We find that one fifth of the gender pay gap results from segregation of workers across firms and one fifth from job segregation. We also show that the widely <b>documented</b> <b>glass</b> ceiling effect operates mainly through worker allocation to firms rather than occupations...|$|R
