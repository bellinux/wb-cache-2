5|$|The {{number of}} wage rates and wage scales was {{drastically}} reduced; {{this not only}} cut bureaucracy, but also ensured that workers would be more <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> on {{a wider range of}} tasks. Time workers, for example, would be paid the same regardless of which task they carried out during their shift. This allowed managers to better distribute labour and reduce the frequency of bottlenecks occurring in production. They could do this because workers would be paid a similar rate no matter what they undertook, so it became easier to move workers between tasks.|$|E
5|$|Irene {{remained}} {{confined in}} a palace at the Harbour of Eleutherios {{in the capital}} and retained her formal title as empress. Then, on 15 January 792, for reasons not clear, she was recalled to the imperial palace with her title as empress and co-ruler confirmed and her name restored in the imperial acclamations. Staurakios too {{seems to have been}} recalled and, along with Irene, again took {{an active role in the}} governance of the state. This turn of events drove the Armeniacs once again to mutiny, but their commander, Alexios Mosele, was in Constantinople. Despite guarantees of safety, Mosele was imprisoned and later blinded at the instigation of Irene and Staurakios, both <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> revenge for his role in their overthrow in 790.|$|E
5|$|Fellini secured {{financing}} {{through the}} producers Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti, {{who wanted to}} cast Silvana Mangano (De Laurentiis' wife) as Gelsomina and Burt Lancaster as Zampanò, but Fellini refused these choices. Giulietta Masina had been {{the inspiration for the}} entire project, so Fellini was determined never to accept an alternative to her. For Zampanò, Fellini had hoped to cast a nonprofessional and, to that end, he tested a number of circus strongmen, to no avail. He also had trouble finding the right person for the role of Il Matto. His first choice was the actor Moraldo Rossi, {{who was a member of}} Fellini's social circle and had the right type of personality and athletic physique, but Rossi wanted to be the assistant director, not a performer. Alberto Sordi, the star of Fellini's earlier films The White Sheik and I Vitelloni, was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the role, and was bitterly disappointed when Fellini rejected him after a tryout in costume.|$|E

5|$|On June 15, 1832, President Andrew Jackson, displeased with Atkinson's {{handling}} of the war, appointed General Winfield Scott to take command. Scott gathered about 950 troops from eastern army posts just as a cholera pandemic had spread to eastern North America. As Scott's troops traveled by steamboat from Buffalo, New York, across the Great Lakes towards Chicago, his men started getting sick from cholera, with many of them dying. At each place the vessels landed, the sick were deposited and soldiers deserted. By the time the last steamboat landed in Chicago, Scott had only about 350 effective soldiers left. On July 29, Scott began a hurried journey west, ahead of his troops, <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> command of what was certain to be the war's final campaign, but he would {{be too late to}} see any combat.|$|E

Birds of lovely plumage occasionally flew across it, and after they had anchored in the evening, the air became full of strange noises; great beasts rose and snorted near the banks; sounds of roaring and growling were heard in the wood; and the lads, who had been so <b>eager</b> before <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in a hunt on shore, listened with something like awe to the various strange and often mysterious noises.|$|R

The Assumptionists published anti-Semitic and anti-republican articles in their journal La Croix. This infuriated Republican politicians, who were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> revenge.

An early attempt at peace occurred in 1396 when Charles' daughter, the almost seven-year-old Isabella of Valois, married the 29-year-old Richard II of England. By 1415, however, the feud between the French royal family and the House of Burgundy led to chaos and anarchy throughout France that Henry V of England was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of.

She reflected that the last Cristoval had doubtless passed away without disclosing the secret of the wall to anyone, and his executors, in selling the mansion, had been quite unaware that anything was hidden in the adobe wall. Without doubt the property might now be justly claimed by the new owner, Arthur Weldon, and this thought made Mildred flush with <b>eager</b> resolve <b>to</b> <b>take</b> full advantage of her present opportunity.

Dutton emigrated in 1782 and worked as a surveyor, town official, and toll road owner. His home had a dooryard garden, typical of mid-19th century New England village homes, and his experience settling in the Champlain Valley depicts the industries and lifestyles surrounding Lake Champlain following the Revolutionary War.|$|E

25|$|The Company {{did little}} to fulfil Britain's {{obligations}} to Lewandika; having failed in Katanga, its hierarchy saw Barotseland as an unworkable inconvenience that might later be exchanged with Portugal. Whitehall, by contrast, regarded Lewandika's domain as an important buffer against further Portuguese claims inland. Neither the Company nor the British government proved <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> practical responsibility for the Barotse; in 1894, while informing Britain of his willingness to administer on Whitehall's behalf north of the Zambezi, Rhodes stressed {{that he would not}} take Barotseland.

Taylor immediately regretted the decision. The Giants, who were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> keep Taylor, <b>took</b> part in negotiating his way out of it.

When construction of the railroad line was finally completed in 1840, it was the longest single line of railroad track in the world. The railroad also controlled a line of steamboats that ran from Wilmington to Charleston; it was widely used for passenger travel and transportation of freight. Regular boat lines served Fayetteville, and packet lines traveled to northern ports. The city was a main stop-over point, contributing greatly to its commerce.|$|E

Vincent was not sorry for the change. It took him away from the great theater of the war, but after Chancellorsville he felt no <b>eager</b> desire <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in future battles.

The original script included stereotypical references to Australian culture, such as [...] "prawns on the barbie", but these were cut to avoid turning the episode into a travelogue. Bullen told the Sun Herald, [...] "I really wanted to go beyond 'no worries' and 'she'll be right mate'. We've asked most of the local actors to improvise with their own sayings, to make sure we get it right." [...] In 2003, Bullen recalled this episode's script as the most difficult he had ever written. The collapse of Karen and David's marriage was a controversial issue among the writer and producers; two characters had already divorced and Harries wanted to avoid all three of the main relationships failing. After enjoying the quality of the Australian guest stars, Bullen joked to the Sun Herald that he would write a spin-off series featuring Gary Sweet. Eventually, no spin-off series were created. This episode was produced as the final episode of Cold Feet; Mike Bullen did not believe he could continue writing another series and cast members were <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> other roles. During production in Australia, Bullen's interest in the series was renewed, and he decided he would like to write a final run of episodes.|$|E

[...] Although he was <b>eager</b> <b>to</b> be <b>taken</b> seriously as a legitimate actor, Robey provided a subtle nod in the direction of his comic career by using the wooden cane intended for the Prime Minister of Mirth for the majority of his scenes as Falstaff. The poet John Betjeman responded to the critics' early scepticism: [...] "Variety artistes are a separate world from the legitimate stage. They are separate too, from ballet, opera, and musical comedy. It is possible for variety artists to appear in all of these. Indeed, no one who saw will ever forget the superb pathos and humour of George Robey's Falstaff". Later, in 1935, Blanche Littler persuaded Robey to accept Carroll's earlier offer to play Bottom, and the comedian cancelled three weeks' worth of dates. The press were complimentary of his performance, and he later attributed his success to Littler and her encouragement.|$|R
