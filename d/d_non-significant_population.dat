40|$|Modern {{breeding}} practices {{strive to}} achieve distinctive phenotypic uniformity in breeds of dogs, but these strategies {{are associated with}} the inevitable loss of genetic diversity. Thus, in parallel with the morphological variation displayed by breeds, purebred dogs commonly express genetic defects {{as a result of the}} inbreeding associated with artificial selection and the reduction of selection against disease phenotypes. Microsatellite marker analyses of 15 polymorphic canine loci were used to investigate measures of genetic diversity and population differentiation within and between German-bred and South African-bred German shepherd dogs. These data were quantified by comparison with typically outbred mongrel or crossbred dogs. Both the imported and locally-bred German shepherd dogs exhibited similar levels of genetic diversity. The breed is characterised by only a moderate loss of genetic diversity relative to outbred dogs, despite originating from a single founding sire and experiencing extensive levels of inbreeding throughout the history of the breed. <b>Non-significant</b> <b>population</b> differentiation between the ancestral German and derived South African populations indicates sufficient contemporary gene flow between these populations, suggesting that migration resulting from the importation of breeding stock has mitigated the effects of random genetic drift and a population bottleneck caused by the original founder event in South Africa. Significant differentiation between the combined German shepherd dog population and the outbred dogs illustrates the effects of selection and genetic drift on the breed since its establishment just over 100 years ago...|$|R
40|$|Background: Psychopharmacotherapy {{currently}} {{constitutes the}} first-line treatment for {{depression and anxiety}} in Parkinson’s disease (PD) however the efficacy of antidepressant treatments in PD is unclear. Several alternative treatments have been suggested as potentially more viable alternatives including dopamine agonists, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Method: A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials for depression and/or anxiety in PD was conducted to systematically examine the efficacy of current treatments for depression and anxiety in PD. Results: Nine trials were included. There was only sufficient data to calculate a pooled effect for antidepressant therapies. The pooled effect of antidepressants for depression in PD was moderate but <b>non-significant</b> (<b>d</b> =. 71, 95 % CI = − 1. 33 to 3. 08). The secondary effect of antidepressants on anxiety in PD was large but also <b>non-significant</b> (<b>d</b> = 1. 13, 95 % CI = −. 67 to 2. 94). Two single-trials of non-pharmacological treatments for depression in PD resulted in significant large effects; Omega- 3 supplementation (d =. 92, 95 % CI =. 15 to 1. 69) and CBT (d = 1. 57, 95 % CI = 1. 06 to 2. 07), and warrant further exploration. Conclusions: There remains a lack of controlled trials for both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for depression and anxiety in PD which limits the conclusions which can be drawn. While the pooled effects of antidepressant therapies in PD were non-significant, the moderate to large magnitude of each pooled effect is promising. Non-pharmacological approaches show potential for depression in PD however more research is required...|$|R

40|$|Insect pest {{infestation}} {{is a major}} constraint in cotton production and causes heavy yield losses every year. Some studies report that insect pests attack on genotypes/cultivars with the traits, frego bracts, okra leaf, and red leaf color is comparatively lower. The genotypes/cultivars with these traits were planted and separated by fine netting to assess insect {{pest infestation}} in comparison to commercial cultivars. The Gossypium arboreum cultivar, FH- 170 had minimum number of population buildup of sucking and chewing insect pests. Among hirsutum genotypes/cultivars, minimum population buildup of thrips, mites, spotted bollworm and American bollworm was found on Gumbo Okra. Minimum aphid was recorded on Russian Red. PBG-Fb- 5 showed the most resistant response against pink bollworm. Population buildup of thrips, mites and aphid was relatively higher under water deficit conditions compared to well watered conditions whereas, population buildup of jassid, and white fly was higher under well watered conditions but was <b>non-significant.</b> <b>Populations</b> of parents, F 1 and segregation pattern of F 2 and backcross populations of crosses involving okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf traits showed that the traits were monogenic, okra leaf type and red leaf color being incompletely dominant and frego bract as recessive trait. Gene action of agronomic traits (plant height, number of bolls, number of monopodial branches, number of sympodial branches, boll weight, lint percentage, seed index, fiber fineness, fiber strength, and fiber length) in the crosses involving okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf color were different. Heritability estimates for different agronomic traits in the crosses of okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf color varied from 0. 26 to 0. 95. These results showed {{the interaction of the}} insect resistant traits with agronomic traits. Correlation of the traits, okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf color with agronomic traits showed that okra leaf positively correlated with sympodial branches, lint percentage, fiber fineness (measurement scale has inverse relationship with fiber fineness) and fiber length whereas, negative correlation of okra leaf was observed with plant height and seed index. Frego bract had negative correlation with boll weight and lint percentage. Red leaf color had positive association with lint percentage and negative correlation with number of bolls and sympodial branches and fiber strength. Negative correlation of these insect resistant traits with some desirable agronomic traits reveal that very large F 2 population would be required to find insect resistant recombinants with desirable agronomic attributes. The correlations among agronomic traits in the crosses involving different insect resistant traits were different which suggest that while incorporating each insect resistant trait into a strain, a different breeding strategy will have to be followed. Simple qualitative nature of the traits, okra leaf, frego bract and red leaf color reveals that the traits may easily be incorporated into commercial cultivars...|$|R

40|$|Predation is {{a strong}} {{selective}} force in most natural systems, potentially fueling evolutionary changes in prey morphology, life history and behaviour. Recent work has suggested that contrasting predation pressures may lead to population differentiation in personality traits. However, {{there are indications that}} these personality traits also differ between sexes and not necessarily in a consistent way between populations. We used an integrative approach to quantify boldness (latency to emerge from a shelter) in wild-caught guppies in relation to predation pressure, population origin, sex and size. In addition we quantified the repeatability of these personality traits. We show that predation regime had significant effects on emergence time. In general, fish from high predation localities emerged sooner from the shelter compared to those from low predation localities. We found strong sex differences; males were significantly bolder than females. The relationship between emergence time and body size was <b>non-significant</b> in all <b>populations.</b> We discuss what responses to expect from predator-nave versus predator-experienced individuals and how this can be linked to the shyness-boldness continuum...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} male {{homicide}} rate {{and its relation}} to economic variables in the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo e Rio de Janeiro between 1981 and 1997. The novelty of our approach is the construction of homicide rates specific for each age between 15 and 40 years old. The economic variables' coefficients are significant 1 y different from zero for the population between 15 and 19 years old. As expected, an increase in real wage and a decrease in inequality reduce the rate of homicide. Surprisingly, a decrease in the unemployment rate seems to increase the rate ofhomicide. Most coefficients, however, converge to zero as a generation gets older, becoming <b>non-significant</b> for the <b>population</b> aged 20 years old or more. We also identify an inertia component in the homicide rate: generations with higher homicide rates when young also tend to have higher homicide rates over the remain of their life cycle. Therefore, if economic variables induce a high rate of homicide among young people in a certain year, this high rate tend to persist over the generation life cycle independent 1 y of the economy later behavior.

40|$|Abstract Stocking {{programs}} have been used extensively to mitigate declines in anadromous fishes, but these pro-grams can have long-term unintended genetic conse-quences. Stocking can homogenize population structure, impede local adaptation, and hinder the use of genetic stock identification as a fishery management tool. Using 12 microsatellite loci, we evaluate the spatiotemporal genetic structure of 16 anadromous alewife (Alosa pseudoharen-gus) populations in Maine, USA, to determine whether inter-basin stocking practices have influenced population structure and the genetic diversity of the species in this region. Although, no pre-supplementation samples exist, comparative analyses of stocked and non-stocked popula-tions show that stock transfers have influenced alewife population genetic structure. Genetic isolation by distance (IBD) was <b>non-significant</b> among stocked <b>populations,</b> but significant among non-stocked populations. However, two populations, Dresden Mills and Sewell Pond, appear to have resisted genetic homogenization despite stocking. Non-significant genic and genetic differentiations were broadly distributed among alewife populations. Hierarchi-cal AMOVA indicated highly significant differentiation among temporal replicates within populations, and Baye-sian clustering analysis revealed weak population structure. A significant correlation was observed between stocking (time and events) and pairwise F 0 ST among alewife collec-tions, and an analysis of IBD residuals showed a significant decline {{in the amount of}} genetic differentiation among populations as the extent of stocking activity increased. These findings call for an increased awareness of evolu-tionary processes and genetic consequences of restoration activities such as inter-basin stock transfers by fisheries management and conservation practitioners...|$|R
40|$|Indigenous {{children}} in the Northern Territory experience a disproportionately high burden of respiratory infectious diseases associated with conditions favouring microbial transmission and endemic carriage of respiratory pathogens. The lack of a substantive impact in the prevalence of respiratory diseases {{over the last two}} decades highlights the ongoing need for improvements in health equity for Indigenous Australians. This thesis investigates the impact of maternal pneumococcal vaccination against, and the influence of maternal/infant vitamin D insufficiency on, the risk of infant respiratory infections. Novel vaccination and supplementation strategies have the potential to be translated into practice. Principal findings: 1. In a randomised controlled trial of maternal pneumococcal vaccination for the prevention of infant middle ear disease, receiving the 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in pregnancy:a. Stimulated a strong maternal vaccine serotype-specific antibody response in both blood and breast milk. b. Had a non-significant impact on overall infant ear disease and/or nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine serotypes. c. Reduced the prevalence of ear disease associated with concurrent carriage of vaccine serotypes (a more specific outcome). <b>d.</b> Had a <b>non-significant</b> impact on the incidence of infant acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) hospitalisations. 2. In a prospective cohort of Indigenous mothers and their infants, cord blood vitamin D insufficiency was common at birth and cord blood concentrations were lower among infants subsequently hospitalised with an ALRI compared to infants who were not. 3. In a cross-section of hospitalised Indigenous and non-Indigenous children, vitamin D insufficiency was unexpectedly less common among those with ALRI diagnoses compared to non-ALRI diagnoses (predominantly gastroenteritis).  While the data presented in this thesis need to be interpreted with caution due to small sample sizes and limited significance, the findings suggest that maternal pneumococcal vaccination or vitamin D supplementation may have potential as interventions for the prevention of infant respiratory infections. These data lay a strong foundation for the cohort studies or clinical trials necessary to allow informed decisions regarding the future use of these strategies in routine practice...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES—Vervet monkeys {{are common}} in most tree-rich areas of South Africa, but their absence from {{grassland}} and semi-desert {{areas of the country}} suggest potentially restricted and mosaic local population patterns that may have relevance to local phenotype patterns and selection. A portion of the mtDNA control region was sequenced to study patterns of genetic differentiation. MATERIALS AND METHODS—DNA was extracted and mtDNA sequences were obtained from 101 vervet monkeys at 15 localities which represent both an extensive (widely across the distribution range) and intensive (more than one troop at most of the localities) sampling strategy. Analyses utilized Arlequin 3. 1, MEGA 6, BEAST v 1. 5. 2 and Network V 3. 6. 1 RESULTS—The dataset contained 26 distinct haplotypes, with six populations fixed for single haplotypes. Pairwise P-distance among population pairs showed significant differentiation among most population pairs, but with <b>non-significant</b> differences among <b>populations</b> within some regions. Populations were grouped into three broad clusters in a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree and a haplotype network. These clusters correspond to (i) north-western, northern and northeastern parts of the distribution range as well as the northern coastal belt; (ii) central areas of the country; and (iii) southern part of the Indian Ocean coastal belt, and adjacent inland areas. DISCUSSION—Apparent patterns of genetic structure correspond to current and past distribution of suitable habitat, geographic barriers to gene flow, geographic distance and female philopatry. However, further work on nuclear markers and other genomic data is necessary to confirm these results.

40|$|Multiple {{cropping}} systems {{are used in}} much of the world; however, very little research has been done to breed specific cultivars for this type of environment. This study utilized 196 S 1 lines in 1983 and 120 S 1 lines in 1986 from two random mating sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) populations planted in an intensive intercrop with a legume and in monoculture. Family and family by cropping system variance components were derived to calculate heritabilities and predicted gains from selection (per cycle) for grain yield, date of 50 % anthesis, and plant height. Heritabilities estimated for yield in the intercrop (0. 35 - 0. 57) were lower than those estimated from the monoculture (0. 57 - 0. 84) as were the predicted gains from selection (4. 4 %- 15. 0 % vs 12. 5 %- 74. 5 %, intercrop and monoculture, respectively). However, yield tests of the cycle one population bulks showed that the selections based on intercrop performance (Cli) gave consistent yield increases over the selections based on monoculture performance (Clm) (<b>non-significant</b> in one <b>population</b> and significant at P = 0. 076 in the other). Inbreeding depression was consistently lower in the Cli (3. 8 %) as compared to the Clm (7. 2 %). The S 1 family by cropping system interaction was significant (P = 0. 05) for the four populations tested. Heritabilities for date of 50 % anthesis and were high (0. 76 - 0. 93) for all tested populations as were the heritabilities for plant height (0. 65 - 0. 85). No significant differences for these two variables were detected due to making selections in either {{cropping systems}}. A nearest neighbors type covariance analysis utilizing principal components analysis was used in 1986 to reduce the error mean square. Two thirds of the S 1 families were unreplicated in 1986 to increase design efficiency. It is concluded that the evaluation of the lines in intercrop were more accurate and breeding of sorghum cultivars for intercropping with legumes needs to include some testing in intercrop to obtain the best genotypes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this study {{examined}} post glacial recolonisation by UK roe. Previous studies established three main roe deer lineages exist across Europe: a western (Iberian Peninsula), an eastern (Balkan region) and a central lineage (which spans across central Europe). It was unknown which group British roe deer populations belonged. Using a 419 bp region of the mt-DNA d-loop (HVR 1) amplified from ancient and modern UK samples a direct comparison was made with previously published European data. Results showed that UK populations belong to the central lineage, indicating a post glacial re-colonisation that is likely to have occurred via an eastern route. The estimation of a substitution rate, which was applied to coalescent based methods, detected a signal for divergence of UK roe from continental roe at 5, 600 YBP (HPD 3, 500 - 11, 200 YBP), not long after the proposed date for the land bridge split (7, 500 YBP). Since post glacial re-colonisation, roe were known to have undergone severe fluctuations in population size. Perhaps the most significant fluctuation began during the medieval period, when roe suffered severe declines (bottlenecking) due to over hunting and deforestation. These declines were so severe that, by the 16 th century, roe were believed to have been extirpated (locally extinct) from all southern areas of UK and considered scarce in northern areas. However, by the 19 th century roe began to recover. Recovery in the south may have resulted solely from re-introductions (involving both native and non-native stocks) whilst, in the north, recovery resulted from natural re-colonisation from remnant native stocks. The second part of this study investigated the impacts of this more recent history. This was first investigated using a 750 bp of the mt-DNA d loop region (HVR), 16 microsatellite loci and 18 skull traits from modern roe from across the UK to examine structure and diversity. Results based on both DNA and morphology revealed strong differentiation. Northern roe appeared least impacted by recent events; maintaining patterns of isolation by distance (IBD) and high genetic diversity (compared to southern populations). In contrast, southern roe appeared more strongly impacted by recent events; in particular, IBD was non-significant (although this may have been due to a sample size effect) and genetic diversity was lower (compared to northern populations). The roe re-introduction records indicated that the south western population was native in origin (Perthshire). Genetic data showed that this population was, however, highly differentiated from its proposed source; which could reflect the powerful impact of genetic drift resulting from small founder populations. Alternatively, {{it may be that the}} ancestry of the south western population is more complex than previously assumed. For the other southern population (Norfolk), re-introduction records indicate a non-native (German) origin. In line with this, both genetic and morphological data implied that these roe were highly distinct. The impacts of bottlenecks (including medieval declines and founder events) on roe populations were also examined. Bottleneck analyses examined ‘signatures’ in modern populations based on 16 microsatellites. The strongest evidence of bottlenecking was detected in the Norfolk population, consistent with the small founder group size introduced into this location relatively recently. For the other populations bottleneck signatures tended to be weak and non-significant. Direct comparisons of ancient (pre-bottleneck) and modern (post –bottleneck) populations were made based on 419 bp of mt-DNA d –loop (HVR 1). Results showed considerable losses in genetic diversity between time frames consistent with medieval declines. Northern populations were also found to harbour the highest number of ‘native’ haplotypes and southern populations the lowest. The southern population of Norfolk exhibited only one ‘novel’ haplotype confirming its non-native origin. The impacts of bottlenecks on populations are of concern because they have been shown to reduce population fitness and increase the risk of extinction. Therefore, fitness of roe was examined using fluctuating asymmetry (FA) of 10 skull traits as an indicator of developmental stability. Correlations of FA and genetic diversity indices were examined at the level of individuals within populations, across all populations and among populations. All correlations existed in expected directions; however, correlations tended to be weak and <b>non-significant.</b> Furthermore, among <b>population</b> level FA did not vary significantly across populations providing no indication as to whether fitness has been impacted by past population history. ...|$|R
40|$|Identifying species {{under threat}} from {{extinction}} {{and what is}} driving their decline is vital to biodiversity conservation. Currently, lizard populations worldwide are under serious threat with widespread declines and predictions of multiple extinctions through climate change. No reptile extinction has been recorded in Australia since European settlement. Yet, emerging signs indicate that Australian reptiles are facing major threats from habitat fragmentation and other extinction forces. Contractions {{in the distribution of}} Australian reptiles are well documented with 25 percent of the country’s reptile fauna nominated by conservation agencies and individuals as warranting threatened status and requiring management. One of the most highly endangered lizards in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), Tympanocryptis pinguicolla (grassland earless dragon), is facing range contraction from habitat loss and fragmentation, caused by agricultural and urban development. Tympanocryptis pinguicolla are of particular concern because they are native temperate grassland specialists, a habitat type of which only 0. 5 % of the pre- 1770 area in southeastern Australia remains in a semi-natural condition. It is currently unclear if the remaining populations of T. pinguicolla are stable or if contraction is continuing. In this thesis I report on the ecology of T. pinguicolla using long term mark recapture sampling at two locations: Jerrabomberra West and Majura, and re-sampling of ten former survey sites across the ACT. I compare historic population survey data to that collected for this thesis using a onetailed sign test to estimate declines in population sizes across the ACT. I also used an exponential growth state space model to estimate population trends at Jerrabomberra West and Majura. In addition multistage mark recapture (MSMR) models were used to estimate population sizes and survival rates of T. pinguicolla at these two locations. A gradual <b>non-significant</b> decline in <b>population</b> sizes of T. pinguicolla was observed across all sites from 1995 followed by a dramatic reduction (88 %) from 2006 at the most densely populated site (Jerrabomberra West). Annual survival at that site was estimated to be low (0. 017 to one year of age and 0. 024 to adulthood) over the three years of the study. Of the ten sites at which T. pinguicolla were previously known to be present, four (40 %) contained no trace of the lizards, despite extensive survey. To further understand what was driving these declines I conducted a Population Viability Analysis (PVA). Reproductive parameters for the PVA were informed using past survey data combined with data collected as part of this thesis work. Based on four discovered nests, clutch size was considered comparable to closely related agamids (5 – 7), with small (24 mm snout–vent length, 0. 62 g) hatchlings and single clutches per year. In addition T. pinguicolla diet was examined using Schoener’s overlap index for differences between sites and electivity. Tympanocryptis pinguicolla feed on invertebrate prey, selecting for a small number of orders such as Coleoptera (beetles) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths, including larvae). Using this survival and reproductive data to build the PVA, I showed that the Jerrabomberra population had a very high probability (100 %) of extinction within ten years and that the parameters most likely to be driving this decline were juvenile survival and fecundity. Taken together, these data suggest a regional decline in T. pinguicolla that places the species in grave jeopardy of extinction. The key extinction factors for T. pinguicolla are likely to include extreme drought conditions, coincident with over grazing and habitat fragmentation. The power of monitoring grids (each comprised of 56 artificial shelter burrows) to detect T. pinguicolla was also assessed. I combined the use of zero inflated models with the proportion of traps occupied at a location to determine the number of shelter burrows required to have a given probability of detecting the species if it is present. Three-visit detection probabilities for T. pinguicolla were low {{at the beginning of the}} six week sampling period (February – March) (0. 12 - 0. 22) but reached levels (up to 0. 5) comparable with the few other lizards for which detection probability have been estimated. In the situation where population density was at its lowest, 26 artificial burrows are needed to be checked for six weeks (18 checks) from February into March to have a 50 % confidence of detecting the species if it is present. This rises to 167 burrows checked over the same time period for 99 % confidence of detection. Once the established confidence rises above 60 %, surveying over a longer time period results in a decrease in the trap days (number of artificial burrows multiplied by the number of checks). Given that the timing of the sampling period is one of the most important factors when trying to increase detection, moving the trapping to later in the summer may increase detection success. Overall, these data suggest that this is a species for which the effects of habitat fragmentation and destruction and drought are a real threat. They are clearly still declining within the Canberra region, and if nothing changes, the effects of low fecundity and juvenile survival will drive the populations to extinction within ten years. With low population densities a large effort survey is required but this will be necessary if we want to inform the life history parameters around fecundity for which we currently have little data and we need most to focus on if we are to better model these populations...|$|R
