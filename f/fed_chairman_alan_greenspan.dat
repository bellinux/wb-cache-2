In the early to mid-1990s, many free market economists and policy makers such as U.S. Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill and <b>Fed</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> went on record suggesting the growing US deficit was not a major concern. While several emerging economies had intervening to boost their reserves and assist their exporters from the late 1980s, they only began running a net current account surplus after 1999. This was mirrored in the faster growth for the US current account deficit from the same year, with surpluses, deficits and the associated buildup of reserves by the surplus countries reaching record levels by the early 2000s and growing year by year. Some economists such as Kenneth Rogoff and Maurice Obstfeld began warning that the record imbalances would soon {{need to be addressed}} from as early as 2001, joined by Nouriel Roubini in 2004, {{but it was not until}} about 2007 that their concerns began to be accepted by the majority of economists.|$|E

A variant of this, first the expected AAA bond yield from the Blue Chip survey versus the forward-earnings yield on the S&P 500, and then later versus the 10-year Treasury was developed by Dirk van Dijk at I/B/E/S in the mid-1980s.|$|E

[...] Two lead software developers of bitcoin, Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn, have warned that bubbles may occur.

[...] According to Andolfatto, the price of bitcoin [...] "consists purely of a bubble," [...] but he concedes that many assets have prices that are greater than their intrinsic value.

5000|$|Lou Ranieri of Salomon Brothers, {{inventor}} of the mortgage-backed securities market in the 1970s, warned of the future impact of mortgage defaults: [...] "This is {{the leading edge of}} the storm. ... If you think this is bad, imagine what it's going to be like in the middle of the crisis." [...] In his opinion, more than $100 billion of home loans are likely to default when the problems in the subprime industry appear in the prime mortgage markets. <b>Fed</b> <b>Chairman</b> <b>Alan</b> <b>Greenspan</b> praised the rise of the subprime mortgage industry and the tools used to assess credit-worthiness in an April 2005 speech: Innovation has brought about a multitude of new products, such as subprime loans and niche credit programs for immigrants. Such developments are representative of the market responses that have driven the financial services industry throughout the history of our country ... With these advances in technology, lenders have taken advantage of credit-scoring models and other techniques for efficiently extending credit to a broader spectrum of consumers. ... Where once more-marginal applicants would simply have been denied credit, lenders are now able to quite efficiently judge the risk posed by individual applicants and to price that risk appropriately. These improvements have led to rapid growth in subprime mortgage lending; indeed, today subprime mortgages account for roughly 10 percent of the number of all mortgages outstanding, up from just 1 or 2 percent in the early 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|This {{new form}} of {{imbalance}} began to develop {{in part due to}} the increasing practice of emerging economies, principally China, in pegging their currency against the dollar, rather than allowing the value to freely float. The resulting state of affairs has been referred to as Bretton Woods II. [...] According to Alaistair Chan, [...] "At the heart of the imbalance is China's desire to keep the value of the yuan stable against the dollar. Usually, a rising trade surplus leads to a rising value of the currency. A rising currency would make exports more expensive, imports less so, and push the trade surplus towards balance. China circumvents the process by intervening in exchange markets and keeping the value of the yuan depressed."According to economics writer Martin Wolf, in the eight years leading up to 2007, [...] "three-quarters of the foreign currency reserves accumulated {{since the beginning of time}} have been piled up".In contrast to the changed approach within the emerging economies, US policy makers and economists remained relatively unconcerned about BOP imbalances.

This Article asserts that the big banks were major culprits in causing the crisis by funding the non-bank lenders that created the toxic mortgages, which the big banks securitized and sold to unwary investors. Ironically, banks that were then too big to fail are even larger today. The Article briefly reviews the history of banking from the Founding Fathers to the deregulatory mindset that has been present since 1980.

40|$|It {{has been}} a humbling time for macroeconomists. Dramatic events in the world’s {{financial}} markets, spilling over forcefully to the real economy, ran far ahead of what our neat, coherent models could describe, let alone predict.
