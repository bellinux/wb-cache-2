In this study the network and sieving characteristics of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) hydrogels were investigated. PNIPAAm hydrogels were prepared via free radical using N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAAm) as main monomers and N,N‘-methylenebisacrylamide (MBAAm) as crosslinkers.

However, the potential for inexpensive scale up has not been thoroughly investigated. Researchers at Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland offered another potential solution, utilizing slurry coating techniques - which are currently employed at large scales for electrode production - with a conducting polymer binder. In general, the conducting polymer additive provides both mechanical stabilization and an avenue for conduction, replacing the conventional two-material system of a polymer stabilizer and carbon black particles. The substitution allows both better stabilization and better conduction.|$|E
50|$|The {{behavior}} of quantum dots (QDs) in solution and their interaction with other surfaces {{is of great}} importance to biological and industrial applications, such as optical displays, animal tagging, anti-counterfeiting dyes and paints, chemical sensing, and fluorescent tagging. However, unmodified quantum dots tend to be hydrophobic, which precludes their use in stable, water-based colloids. Furthermore, because the ratio of surface area to volume in a quantum dot {{is much higher than}} for larger particles, the thermodynamic free energy associated with dangling bonds on the surface is sufficient to impede the quantum confinement of excitons. Once solubilized by encapsulation in either a hydrophobic interior micelle or a hydrophilic exterior micelle, the QDs can be successfully introduced into an aqueous medium, in which they form an extended <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network.</b> In this form, quantum dots can be utilized in several applications that benefit from their unique properties, such as medical imaging and thermal destruction of malignant cancers.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{controlled}} release of insulin {{from a series}} of biodegradable hybrid <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> containing dextran derivative of allyl isocyanate (dex-AI) and poly (D,L) lactide diacrylate macromer (PDLLAM) over a wide range of composition ratio was investigated. Laser confocal scanning microscope was used to understand the insulin dispersion and release mechanism in the hydrogels. We found that the dispersion of insulin in the <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> appeared to become less homogeneous as the PDLLAM composition in the hydrogel increased. The increase in hydrogel degradability imparted by PDLLAM incorporation shifted the hydrogel to a more open structure at a later release time, which facilitated the release rate and extent of insulin. From the result of release kinetics study (i. e., diffusion coefficient), insulin release occurred through diffusion and degradation controlled mechanisms. In addition, a comparison of the release characteristics of indomethacin, insulin and bovine serum albumin from the <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> showed that the following parameters determined the release kinetics: drug molecular weight and size, hydrogel swellability and degradability, drug solubility in water and the hydrophobic interaction between drugs and the <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network...</b>|$|E

40|$|Major {{drawbacks}} {{of synthetic}} hydrogels are their poor mechanical properties and their limited ability to allow cell attachment and proliferation. By photo-cross-linking mixtures of dimethacrylate-functionalized oligomers (macromers) in a combinatorial manner in solution, synthetic hydrogels with high water uptake and the remarkable ability to promote cell adhesion and proliferation were prepared. A total of 255 different networks based on poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) -, poly(D,L-lactide) (PDLLA) -, poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) - and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) macromers were synthesized simultaneously and screened {{for their ability}} to allow the adhesion of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in a high throughput-like manner. Of these <b>networks,</b> several <b>hydrogels</b> could be identified that were able to take up large amounts of water {{while at the same time}} allowed the adhesion of cells. By synthesizing these <b>hydrogel</b> <b>networks</b> anew and analyzing the cell adhesion and proliferation behavior of human mesenchymal stem cells to these synthetic hydrogels in more detail, it was confirmed that mixed-macromer <b>hydrogel</b> <b>networks</b> prepared from equal amounts of PTMC-dMA 4 k, PDLLA-dMA 4 k, PCL-dMA 4 k, PEG-dMA 4 k, and PEG-dMA 10 k and <b>hydrogel</b> <b>networks</b> prepared from PTMC-dMA 4 k, PDLLA 4 k, PEG-dMA 4 k, PTMC-dMA 10 k and PEG-dMA 10 k were highly hydrophilic (water uptake was respectively 181 +/- 2 and 197 +/- 18 wt % water) and allowed very good cell adhesion and proliferation. Furthermore, these networks were extremely resilient in the hydrated state, with tearing energies of respectively 0. 64 +/- 0. 34 and 0. 27 +/- 0. 04 kJ/m(2). This is much higher than other synthetic hydrogels described in literature and close to articular cartilage (1 kJ/m(2)) ...|$|R
30|$|The {{percentage}} encapsulation of both {{drugs in}} the <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> was high and is attributed to the water solubility of drugs.

Similar results have been reported by other researchers in which percentage loading of hydrophilic drugs onto <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> was enhanced [19, 20, 21]. The percentage encapsulation efficiency of PG for GW 1 PG–GW 4 PG hydrogels was 88, 73, 72, and 90 %, respectively, while the percentage encapsulation efficiency of CQ onto GW 1 CQ–GW 4 CQ hydrogel was 53, 60, 60, and 52 %, respectively. The FTIR spectrum (Fig.  1 a) for GW 1 hydrogel revealed characteristic peaks for OH stretching at 3317  cm− 1, NH stretching of amide at 3182  cm− 1, and C=O stretching of amide at 1648  cm− 1, indicating the successful crosslinking of the acrylamide used for {{the preparation of the}} hydrogels [16]. The FTIR spectrum for GW 2 and GW 3 containing WPI showed C–O–C glycosidic absorption peak at 1167  cm− 1 and C=O stretch for rGO at 1738  cm, confirming crosslinking of the WPI and rGO in the <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> (Fig.  1 a). The C=O stretch for rGO further confirmed the interaction of the rGO with the polymer in the <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network.</b> Some researchers reported similar findings for hydrogels containing rGO [16, 17]. The absence of the NH 2 stretching which was conspicuous in pure acrylamide in the GW 1 –GW 4 hydrogel further confirmed the successful crosslinking of acrylamide (Fig.  1 a). Hydrogels GW 3 loaded with either PG or CQ did not exhibit peaks for the drugs, confirming physical entrapment of CQ and PG into the <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> (Fig.  1 b, c).

The networks were compared on their degradation in vitro and in vivo. It was shown that network density and macromer composition could be used to tailor the degradation rates and properties. Then, the applicability of resins based on macromers with a relatively high molecular weight in stereolithography was explored. Macromers with molecular weights higher than 20 kg/mol were used to prepare processable resins. Designed structures were then built and characterized. Furthermore, a porous meniscus implant with properties close to those of the human meniscus was designed and prepared. The toughness of PTMC networks prepared from mixtures of high and low molecular weight macromer mixtures was investigated.

40|$|Stem cell {{behavior}} is {{strongly influenced by}} the physical and chemical cues originating from the extracellular matrix (ECM). In vivo, ECM signals are displayed in a spatiotemporally complex fashion. Current in vitro models to study the role of ECM signals in regulating stem cell behavior are rather limited in recapitulating this microenvironmental complexity, as they are mostly static and homogeneous. In order to achieve a dynamic control of the physical and biochemical properties of a <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network,</b> we here combined two crosslinking reaction schemes with photochemistry {{in order to control}} hydrogel stiffness in space, time and intensity. First, thiol moieties of one of the reactive poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) macromers undergoing crosslinking into a <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> via Michael-type addition were equipped with caging groups. This prevented their reaction with vinyl sulfone groups on the termini of the complementary PEG macromers. Thus, the crosslinking density of the <b>hydrogel</b> <b>network</b> could be controlled by uncaging with light, directly translating into differential hydrogel stiffness. Using this approach, user-defined two-dimensional stiffness patterns between 3 - 8 kPa (E modulus) were obtained and shown to influence the directional migration of mesenchymal stem/progenitor cells in a Young?s modulus-dependent manner with constant gradient strength. Cell migration was overall more directed on the photo-patterned substrate compared to the non-patterned region, with a bias towards the stiffer region above 5 kPa. Second, we present an approach based on light-activated enzymatic crosslinking by which the biophysical properties of synthetic hydrogels can be modulated in 3 D. A peptide substrate of the activated transglutaminase Factor XIII (FXIIIa), a key ECM crosslinking enzyme, was rendered photosensitive by masking its active site with a photolabile cage group. Covalent incorporation of this caged FXIIIa substrate together with the corresponding acceptor enzyme substrate into PEG hydrogels and subsequent laser-scanning lithography affords highly localized additional crosslinking. By encapsulation of intestinal stem cell-derived organoids followed by the photopatterning of precise three-dimensional stiffness areas we {{hope to be able to}} direct their self-organization.
