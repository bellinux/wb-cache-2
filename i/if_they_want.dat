5|$|Basically, {{a lot of}} {{you know}} the {{political}} situation in my professional career is not positive. It's been really, really hard. I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> you to hear this. I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|The film's title {{comes from}} the fictional S video series {{directed}} by Rost. In the videos, Rost stalks women {{for a long time}} and, after learning about them, he asks them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> {{to be a part of}} his films. All of the videos are first person with no dialogue. The film references other films, including Peeping Tom, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, , Kill the Scream Queen, and The Crucifier.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} {{mechanic}} {{to the series}} {{is the use of}} a slate found on all the Ages. These slates can be carved using the mouse to create shapes and symbols. The use of the slate is necessary to communicate with a shadowy race of creatures known as the Bahro. The Bahro understand certain symbols drawn on the slate and will respond to them; the creatures also retrieve the slate and return it to its original space if the player drops it. Slate symbols can cause environmental changes such as rain or increased wind, which may be necessary for solving puzzles. The slate cannot be carried everywhere due to its size. For example, the player will have to leave the slate behind <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to climb a ladder.|$|E
50|$|This {{referendum}} {{asked to}} abolish the law excluding any responsibility for judicial errors. Italian voters had to say yes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to abolish judges' exclusion from civil responsibility, or no <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to maintain it.

5|$|An English fan {{translation}} of Ace Attorney Investigations 2, subtitled Prosecutor's Path, has been developed, and includes localized names for new {{characters in the}} style of Capcom's Ace Attorney localizations. The translation project was done on the Ace Attorney fan site Court-Records, where a user asked people who were interested in the project to send in applications, which had to be approved for them {{to become part of the}} project. Alexa Ray Corriea at Polygon described this approach as uncommon, with most fan translation projects letting anyone help <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> but said that it made the project more professional. A patch translating the game's first two episodes was released in 2013, and a complete patch for the game was released in 2014. A final patch was later released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to get elected, they must come and listen {{to the demands of the}} people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake {{awake in}} a prison cell full of bananas, {{confused}} and unaware of how they arrived at their location. A demonic prison guard tells {{them that they are}} in the Nightosphere, the hellish realm ruled by Marceline's (voiced by Olivia Olson) father, Hunson Abadeer (voiced by Martin Olson). The two set off to locate Marceline's father and navigate back to their home dimension. Traversing the Nightosphere, Finn and Jake learn that they need to seek an audience with Hunson Abadeer <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to leave. Eventually, they reach a line composed of demons who seek petitions from their demonic overlord. Just then, a storm cloud appears in a mist, slaying all the demons present; Finn and Jake barely escape death.|$|E
50|$|This {{referendum}} {{asked to}} abolish the authorization for ENEL to build nuclear power plants outside Italy. Italian voters had to say yes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to forbid any worldwide nuclear engagement of Italy, or no <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to continue an Italian nuclear research abroad. The referendum had a turnout of 65.1%.|$|R
50|$|This {{referendum}} {{asked to}} abolish {{the power of the}} State to oblige the local administrations to accept new nuclear plants in their territory. Italian voters had to say yes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to support local administrations, or no <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to maintain statal supremacy about this theme. The referendum had a turnout of 65.1%.|$|R
25|$|Faced with an {{impending}} split between its monarchists and republicans, a compromise was brokered at the 1917 Ard Fheis (party conference) whereby the party would campaign {{to create a}} republic, then let the people decide <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> a monarchy or republic, subject to the proviso that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> a king, <b>they</b> could not choose someone from Britain's Royal Family.|$|R
5|$|Kyle becomes annoyed, {{responding}} {{that the}} economy is not actually angry with them, and that they should be out spending money, and continues to preach {{that the economy}} only exists as a mental construct, and that people have lost their faith in it because of the recession. He then convinces his friends that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> the economy to be strong, they must have faith in it. Upon hearing of this heresy, Randy and his makeshift economic council decide that they must kill Kyle. Cartman, in his desire to obtain a copy of , says that he will deliver Kyle to Randy and his friends in exchange for the game.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} sold {{and the new}} owners, the Deetz family, arrive from New York City. Charles Deetz is a former real estate developer; his wife Delia, a sculptor; and his goth {{daughter}} Lydia, from his first marriage, is an aspiring photographer. Under the guidance of interior designer Otho, Delia begins to transform the house into a posh modern art piece. Consulting the Handbook, the Maitlands travel to a netherworld waiting room populated by other distressed souls, where they discover that the afterlife is structured according to a complex bureaucracy involving vouchers and the usual overworked caseworkers. The Maitlands' own caseworker, Juno, informs them that they must remain {{in the house for}} 125 years. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> the Deetzes out of the house, it is up to them to scare them away. Barbara's and Adam's attempts at scaring the family prove counterproductive, despite their ability to shape-shift into monsters.|$|E
5|$|When using Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection {{for online}} multiplayer, the player can choose between a match with a random {{opponent}} {{from around the}} world, or a match with someone that the player has exchanged friend codes with. Worldwide matches are limited to two players, with the weather conditions being randomly generated and a map randomly chosen from a set list. Worldwide match players can choose <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> an opponent close to their skill level or to play against an opponent regardless of skill level. When playing with a friend, more options are opened up to allow greater customization of the match, such as the type of weather and {{the duration of the}} match. Voice chat is only supported when playing with a friend, and is unavailable during worldwide online play. However, Caulder can not be used in ONLINE multiplayer due to his extreme advantages.|$|E

50|$|When Bradley {{showed up}} to Google's offices, he {{demonstrated}} the software for them, and when they asked what he wanted, he had stated that he would consult for free <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to purchase the rights to his technology. He explained the prior offer of $500,000 and said {{he knew he could}} get it, but would settle for $100,000 <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> to work together.|$|R
30|$|The meeting {{lasted for}} one hour. Towards the end, the members were asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> maths {{workshops}} {{for parents and}} children because this had been expressed in previous meetings with the Head of School Campus. Of importance was that the community needed time to network and discuss <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> me to return and work with parents and children {{on the island and}} <b>if</b> <b>they</b> identified that there were benefits for their community.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris {{learns that}} his best customer, Herbert, has made Kyle, a neighbor's {{son and a}} bully, his new paper boy. Chris decides to confront them both but ends up getting pushed over by Kyle and laughed at by Kyle's friends {{subsequently}} returning home in tears much to Peter and Lois' concern. Peter goes to talk with Kyle who makes fun of him over and over. Unable to control his anger toward Kyle, Peter beats him up leaving Kyle bleeding and bruised. Kyle’s mother agrees not to press charges if Peter apologizes to Kyle which he reluctantly does. Kyle comments on how good bullying makes you feel which encourages Peter to become a bully. Peter splashes a {{pot of boiling water}} over Lois and makes her punch herself in the face. He also hits Stewie on his sunburned buttocks, knocks Chris out of his chair, and sticks his large butt out at Meg to fart repeatedly in her face following her backwards around the kitchen table until she finally trips and vomits on the floor at which Peter gets mad with her. When Peter also bullies his friends, such as using Joe as a marionette and pulling Cleveland's pants down, Lois points out that he is as bad as his old school bully, Randy Fulcher. Deciding he should bully him instead, Peter finds Randy who is now suffering from multiple sclerosis. Thinking, when Randy says “I have MS,” that he is bragging that he has a monkey’s scrotum, Peter is about to beat up Randy but is stopped by Chris who beats Peter up instead and finally convinces him bullying is wrong. As the event is witnessed by a wrong sounding Kermit the Frog and a wrong sounding Swedish Chef, a wrong sounding Fozzie Bear (voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan) asks them <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to hear a joke as the episode ends.|$|E

This core group met in a hotel room at the Greenwood Inn in Beaverton, Oregon, and decided {{that they were going to}} use their experience to start the company that would eventually become TriQuint.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2012, {{coincident}} with {{warnings from}} Mario Draghi of the ECB, Rehn {{said that even}} if Eurobonds [...] "were ever approved, it would still {{not be sufficient to}} save the euro.

The ennuchs decided to make Sultan Husayn the new shah of Iran.|$|R

25|$|The next day, on 6 November, {{people kept}} protesting, {{although}} in fewer numbers (6,000 in Bucharest and several thousands in other cities). The president told the civil representatives {{that he will}} come incognito {{to talk to people}} in the streets, indirectly hinting that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> true change they need to keep asking for it so the politicians can't pretend they don't understand what is asked of them.|$|E
