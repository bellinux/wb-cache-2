40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the evolution of}} airpower and the ever-increasing component <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> in dictating warfare, based on the need felt in the literature to integrate {{and place them in}} the right perspective. Hence, the role <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> aircraft and the dominance of all aspects <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology,</b> especially in recent conflicts, are reviewed. The integration of the fundamental aspects <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology,</b> through its classification, types of aircraft signatures: especially radar, infrared, and visual signatures, their sources of origin, modelling techniques, and methods of signature reduction are discussed. Due to the increasing importance of infrared signatures relative to radar signatures, infrared signatures are also closely examined and analysed. Hence, the lock-on and surveillance ranges of infrared detectors are compared. Future projections in <b>stealth</b> <b>technology,</b> especially based on the role of anti-stealth technologies, are also elaborated...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the first}} {{principles}} <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> was to shape the surface of aircraft so {{that they did not}} reflect the transmitted beam directly back at the shared antenna. Another technique was to absorb some of the radar in the coating of the aircraft.|$|R

50|$|Stealth {{aircraft}} {{are designed to}} avoid detection {{using a variety of}} technologies that reduce reflection/emission of radar, infrared, visible light, radio-frequency (RF) spectrum, and audio, collectively known as <b>stealth</b> <b>technology.</b> Development <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> likely began in Germany during World War II, the prototyped Horten Ho 229 was designed for twin BMW 003 jet engines but finally powered by twin Junkers Jumo 004 jet engines being described as the first stealth aircraft. Well-known modern examples <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>of</b> U.S. aircraft include the United States' F-117 Nighthawk (1981-2008), the B-2 Spirit, the F-22 Raptor, and the F-35 Lightning II.|$|R
50|$|Infrared stealth {{is an area}} <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> {{aimed at}} {{reducing}} infrared signatures. This reduces a platform's susceptibility to infrared guided weapons and infrared surveillance sensors, and thus increases the platform's overall survivability.

40|$|Many {{years ago}} the word stealth {{could have been used}} in the context of ground troops moving undetectably through enemy terrain.

The appearance, or rather the acknowledgement, <b>of</b> a <b>stealth</b> fighter aircraft in 1988 (when the F- 117 A was officially unveiled to the public) was an impressive statement underscoring the remarkable development <b>of</b> advanced <b>stealth</b> <b>technologies.</b> Although the existence <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> for aircraft was vaguely acknowledged by the Carter administration, the F- 117 A program remained in the black world from its inception in November 1978 until the Pentagon officially announced its existence on November 10, 1988.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the modern}} battlefield, Radar {{is one of}} the most {{important}} equipment in the field of information access and precision-guided, battlefield targets face increasing radar threat, the application <b>of</b> radar <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> can improve the survivability of the target to some extent. But the development <b>of</b> radar <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> with tank for typical ground weapon is slow, especially to the existing ground weapon. This paper analyzes the distribution of radar scattering characteristics of the existing tank, and the deformable member for shape stealth for existing tank is designed, the results prove that the RCS of tank can be preferably reduced with the deformable members...|$|R
50|$|Sea Shadow {{was built}} in 1984 to examine the {{application}} <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> on naval vessels, and was used in secret until a public debut in 1993. In addition, the ship was designed to test the use of automation to reduce crew size. The ship {{was created by the}} Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the U.S. Navy and Lockheed. Sea Shadow was developed at Lockheed's Redwood City, California, facility, inside the Hughes Mining Barge (HMB-1), which functioned as a floating drydock during construction and testing.|$|R
5000|$|... 4.5 {{generation}} fighters {{first entered}} {{service in the}} early 1990s, {{and most of them}} are still being produced and evolved. It is quite possible that they may continue in production alongside fifth-generation fighters due to the expense of developing the advanced level <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> needed to achieve aircraft designs featuring very low observables (VLO), which is one of the defining features of fifth-generation fighters. Of the 4.5th generation designs, the Strike Eagle, Super Hornet, Typhoon, Gripen, and Rafale have been used in combat.|$|R
50|$|Fundamental aspects <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology</b> were {{developed}} at NRL, including the radar absorption mechanisms in ferrite-containing materials. Metal bearing surface treatments using Cr ion implantation researched at NRL nearly tripled the service life of Navy turbine engine parts and was adopted for Army helicopter parts as well. Fluorinated polyurethane coatings developed at NRL {{are used to}} line fuel storage tanks throughout the US Navy, reducing leakage and environmental and fuel contamination. The same polymer films are used in Los Angeles-class submarine radomes to repel water and enable radar operation soon after surfacing.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{promising}} {{application is}} in the field <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology.</b> The RCS has been conventionally reduced either by Radar absorbent material (RAM) or by purpose shaping of the targets such that the scattered energy can be redirected away from the source. While RAMs have narrow frequency band functionality, purpose shaping limits the aerodynamic performance of the target. More recently, metasurfaces are synthesized that can redirect the scattered energy away from the source using either array theory or generalized Snell's law [...] This has led to aerodynamically favorable shapes for the targets with the reduced RCS.|$|R
40|$|Infrared (IR) {{emissions}} from aircraft {{are used to}} detect, track, and lock-on to the target. MAN Portable Air Defence Systems (MANPADS) have emerged as {{a major cause of}} aircraft and helicopter loss. Therefore, IR signature studies are important to counter this threat for survivability enhancement, and are an important aspect <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology.</b> This paper reviews contemporary developments in this discipline, with particular emphasis on IR signature prediction from aerospace vehicles. The role of atmosphere in IR signature analysis, and relation between IR signature level and target susceptibility are illustrated. Also, IR signature suppression systems and countermeasure techniques are discussed, to highlight their effectiveness and implications in terms of penalties. Â© Elsevie...|$|R

500|$|The {{ability to}} {{approach}} a target unseen was rendered obsolete by advances in radar in the 1940s and 1950s. Since the development <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology,</b> Yehudi lights have attracted renewed interest, first in 1973 when McDonnell Douglas researched a [...] "Quiet Attack" [...] aircraft for the Office of Naval Research, modifying the F-4 Phantom with Yehudi lights on its underside, {{and later in}} the 1970s when Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works was contracted to develop a stealth aircraft prototype Have Blue, which helped to guide the development <b>of</b> the F-117A <b>stealth</b> fighter and the B-2 stealth bomber. The Have Blue prototype was disruptively camouflaged to disguise its shape from casual onlookers, as well as being constructed of angled facets to reduce its radar cross-section. The use of any form of active camouflage, whether Yehudi lights or microwave emissions, was however rejected.|$|R
50|$|The radar was a {{landmark}} in aviation {{since it was}} the first time a PESA radar (previously found only on ground based systems and the B-1 strategic bomber) had been installed in a jet fighter. The Zaslon radar was publicly unveiled at the 1991 Paris Airshow with its associated MiG-31 interceptor, the Russians even removing the radome of the fighter to allow the Zaslon's revolutionary antenna to be seen. Also at Paris was the US F-117 Nighthawk (revolutionary for its use <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology)</b> which the Russians suggested should take to the air with the MiG-31 to see if the Zaslon could detect the F-117. Unfortunately no such contest was ever conducted though Russian experts were confident that Zaslon would have been able to detect the F-117 during flight.|$|R
50|$|The {{history of}} the Russian {{aircraft}} engineering originated from a pioneer of aviation Alexander Mozhaysky who made his first attempt to fly by his own design aircraft (monoplane) as early as in 1881. In the 20th century a number of prominent Soviet aerospace engineers, inspired by the fundamental works of Nikolai Zhukovsky, Sergei Chaplygin etc. supervised the creation of many dozens of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of KBs (Construction Bureaus) that now constitute the bulk of Russian United Aircraft Corporation. A number of individual inventors also made important contributions to aircraft technology, such as Gleb Kotelnikov who invented the knapsack parachute, or Evgeniy Chertovsky who introduced the pressure suit. Theoretical works by Petr Ufimtsev {{played a critical role}} in development <b>of</b> <b>stealth</b> <b>technology.</b>|$|R
