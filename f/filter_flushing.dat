40|$|International audienceMany recent microarrays hold an {{enormous}} number of probe sets, thus raising many practical and theoretical problems in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Biologically, it is likely that most probe sets are associated with un-expressed genes, so the measured values are simply noise due to non-specific binding; also many probe sets are associated with non-differentially-expressed (non-DE) genes. In an analysis to find DE genes, these probe sets contribute to the false discoveries, so it is desirable to filter out these probe sets prior to analysis. In the methodology proposed here, we first fit a robust linear model for probe-level Affymetrix data that accounts for probe and array effects. We then develop a novel procedure called <b>FLUSH</b> (<b>Filtering</b> Likely Uninformative Sets of Hybridizations), which excludes probe sets that have statistically small array-effects or large residual variance. This filtering procedure was evaluated on a publicly available data set from a controlled spiked-in experiment, as well as on a real experimental data set of a mouse model for retinal degeneration.

50|$|Karnataka is {{a pioneer}} in the concept of {{rainwater}} harvesting with The Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST) implementing one of the largest rainwater harvesting projects in the world. 23683 schools in rural Karnataka were selected for this project with the main goal of providing drinking water by using the method of rooftop harvesting. In this project, rainwater collected on the rooftop is channeled through a system of PVC pipes and stored in an enclosed surface tank. The pipeline consists of a first-flush <b>filter</b> which <b>flushes</b> out the first rainfall along with other contaminants that may exist on the roof and then subsequent cleaner rainwater is allowed to pass on to the tank. A sand bed filter is used to further eliminate impurities in the water before it gets collected in the tank. Further precautions are taken to prevent dust and insects from entering the tank.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Pollutants in {{rainwater}} often {{cause problems}} such as non-point source pollutant and deterioration of collected water quality in rainwater harvesting systems. Fiber filter media {{have been developed to}} resolve these problems by removing pollutants in rainwater by filtration and ion-exchange mechanisms. They have been also successfully applied for the treatment of first-flush rainwater. However, little information is available on the long-term efficiency and the lifetime of the fiber filter media. In this study, new and used fiber filter media were compared in terms of their filterability and ion-exchange capability. The used filter media samples were taken from a first <b>flush</b> <b>filter</b> in a rainwater harvesting system located in an elementary school in Kyonggi-Do. They were used from 2005 to 2010 without any replacement or cleaning. Water quality parameters of an inflow and outflow in the first <b>flush</b> <b>filter</b> were analyzed to quantify the on-site treatment efficiency of the used media. It was shown that the turbidity was removed by approximately 60 % and COD was partly removed. The removal efficiency of particles by the used media was similar to that by the new media. Nevertheless, the removal efficiencies of nitrogen and phosphorous by the used media were substantially reduced when compared with the new media. This suggests that the fiber filter media should be periodically replaced to maintain high removals of nutrients. On the other hand, they can be used for more than 6 years if their primary purpose is to removal particles...|$|R

This leads to a peak of turbidity that has to be controlled. In this paper, we develop a distributed linear model of the turbidity dynamics that is used for real-time adaptive control of the flushes.

50|$|Closed-loop: Motor-return is {{connected}} {{directly to the}} pump-inlet. To keep up pressure on the low pressure side, the circuits have a charge pump (a small gearpump) that supplies cooled and filtered oil to the low pressure side. Closed-loop circuits are generally used for hydrostatic transmissions in mobile applications. Advantages: No directional valve and better response, the circuit can work with higher pressure. The pump swivel angle covers {{both positive and negative}} flow direction. Disadvantages: The pump cannot be utilized for any other hydraulic function in an easy way and cooling can be a problem due to limited exchange of oil flow. High power closed loop systems generally must have a 'flush-valve' assembled in the circuit in order to exchange much more flow than the basic leakage flow from the pump and the motor, for increased cooling and <b>filtering.</b> The <b>flush</b> valve is normally integrated in the motor housing to get a cooling effect for the oil that is rotating in the motor housing itself. The losses in the motor housing from rotating effects and losses in the ball bearings can be considerable as motor speeds will reach 4000-5000 rev/min or even more at maximum vehicle speed. The leakage flow as well as the extra flush flow must be supplied by the charge pump. A large charge pump is thus very important if the transmission is designed for high pressures and high motor speeds. High oil temperature is usually a major problem when using hydrostatic transmissions at high vehicle speeds for longer periods, for instance when transporting the machine from one work place to the other. High oil temperatures for long periods will drastically reduce the lifetime of the transmission. To keep down the oil temperature, the system pressure during transport must be lowered, meaning that the minimum displacement for the motor must be limited to a reasonable value. Circuit pressure during transport around 200-250 bar is recommended.|$|R

METHODS: The cause and management of shallow anterior chamber after glaucoma surgery on 298 cases(462 eyes) were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: In 298 cases(462 eyes), 99 eyes(21. 4 %) had shallow anterior chamber. In 358 eyes treated with trabeculectomy, 77 eyes(21. 5 %) had shallow anterior chamber. In 85 eyes treated with trabeculectomy+MMC(mitomycin C), 20 eyes(23. 5 %) had shallow anterior chamber. In 19 eyes treated with trabeculectomy combined with cataract phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, 2 eyes(10. 53 %) had shallow anterior chamber. Shallow anterior chamber appeared at 1 day to 5 days postoperatively. Forty-two eyes(42. 4 %) were with excessive filtering, 6 eyes(6. 1 %) with malignant glaucoma, 29 eyes(29. 3 %) with choroidal detachment, 2 eyes(2. 0 %) with malignant glaucoma complicated by choroidal detachment. Of 99 eyes with shallow anterior chamber, anterior chamber of 79 eyes recovered treated by nonsurgical methods, 20 eyes treated by operation.

This article describes two flow injection–chemiluminescence methods to measure H 2 O 2 and O 2 – production by marine diatoms. These methods each incorporated a polycarbonate filter unit in which live cells were immobilized, followed by downstream determination of H 2 O 2 and O 2 – in the cell filtrate. The sample analysis rate was ~ 1 min– 1 for H 2 O 2 and continuous for O 2 – during assays with diatom cells. The respective detection limits for each system were 1. 9 nM (H 2 O 2) and 1. 6 nM (O 2 –).

Moreover, this production was proportional to the biomass present on the <b>flushed</b> <b>filter.</b> These methods enable the monitoring of real-time fluctuations of biological ROS production in response to changing environmental conditions, and therefore facilitate analysis of the biotic component of ROS production and the subsequent impacts on chemical speciation of nutrients and trace metals in aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The use {{of active}} {{pharmaceutical}} ingredients (APIs) is increasing continuously and thereby constitutes a {{potential source of}} surface water contamination. Environmental concentrations of APIs are usually at trace levels, generally in low ng/L concentrations, making them challenging to detect. However, these low concentrations can be sufficient to induce toxic effects on the aquatic environment. This project focuses on selected APIs, which {{are probably the most}} common in the aquatic environment. Several of the compounds selected are on The Norwegian Institute of Public Health’s (NIPH’s) list over the most prescribed APIs in Norway throughout 2014. A rapid, sensitive and selective method was developed and validated for screening of seven APIs (acetaminophen, atenolol, fluoxetine, sulfapyridine, sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim and xylazine) in surface water. The method include an on-line automatic filter and <b>filter</b> back <b>flush</b> (AFFL) solid phase extraction (SPE) in combination with capillary liquid chromatography (capLC) coupled to a triple quadrupole mass analyser (MS). By combining large volume injection (100 μL) and the AFFL-SPE-system, a rugged and high throughput switching system was obtained. The analytes were loaded under non-eluting condition and further trapped on a reversed phase (RP) Kromasil (C 18, 5 mm x 1 mm ID, 5 μm) SPE-column with a flow rate of 150 μL/min. A 10 minutes gradient was applied using an ACE C 18 column (150 mm x 0. 3 mm ID, 3 μm) as analytical column with a flow rate of 4 μL/min. The mobile phases (MP) for loading and MP A consisted of type 1 water with 0. 1 % formic acid (FA) and the organic MP (MP B) consisted of 100 % methanol with 0. 1 % FA (pH 2. 7). The total analysis time was 15 minutes including 6 minutes reconditioning. This study demonstrates that the AFFL-SPE-capLC system combined with a triple quadrupole MS enables the detection of selected classes of APIs in surface water in a concentration range of 10 - 100 ng/L. The calculated concentration limit of detection (cLOD) for the selected APIs was in the 2 – 18 ng/L range and calculated concentration limit of quantification (cLOQ) in the 5 – 54 ng/L range. Acceptable linearity (R 2 = 0. 9777 - 0. 9998) and generally high apparent recovery values (from 69 - 288 %) with generally relative standard deviation (RSD %) lower than 20 % were found...|$|R

The reactor was operated both alone {{and as part of}} a two-stage process in series with an anaerobic filter. Operating with a hydraulic flush to give hydraulic retention times (HRT) between 1. 6 and 5. 3 days, and a solids retention time (SRT) of 20 days increased hydrolysis in comparison with a control reactor where HRT and SRT were equal. Overall biodegradability was low; however, with an effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) equivalent to 30 % of the substrate biochemical methane potential (BMP). When operated as part of a two-stage process using effluent from the anaerobic <b>filter</b> as the <b>flush</b> liquor the characteristics of the system changed substantially with an increase in performance to an overall methane production of 0. 22 – 0. 24 L g? 1 volatile solids (VS) added. This was achieved even when the maximum loading of 7. 5 gVS L? 1 day? 1 was applied. During acclimatization the first-stage hydrolytic reactor became methanogenic despite the short HRT, and was responsible for as much as 70 % of the overall methane production. The system could not revert to single-stage operation after acclimatization, showing the continuing importance of the anaerobic filter.

40|$|The lack of {{accessibility}} to {{safe drinking water}} {{is one of the}} primary constraints affecting rural livelihoods, especially in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka. This situation affects the poor more than the rich people in the community. Rainwater harvesting systems (RWHS) were implemented using the roof as the catchment at household level under subsidized schemes, which was a measure to minimize water and sanitation issues. The harvested rainwater was intended to be used for drinking and other domestic purposes with or without treatment. Assessment of the current status of RWHS in the country shows that there is a high correlation between the lack of some of the essential components of RWHS and non-use of the system.

40|$|The Antiproton (Pbar) Source at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory is a {{facility}} comprised {{of a target}} station, two rings called the Debuncher and Accumulator and the transport lines between those rings and {{the remainder of the}} particle accelerator complex. Water {{is by far the most}} common medium for carrying excess heat away from components, primarily electromagnets, in this facility. The largest of the water systems found in Pbar is the 95 degree Fahrenheit Low Conductivity Water (LCW) system. LCW is water which has had free ions removed, increasing its resistance to electrical current. This water circuit is used to cool magnets, power supplies, and stochastic cooling components and typically has a resistivity of 11 [...] 18 megaohms-cm. For more than ten years the Antiproton rings were plagued with overheating magnets due to plugged water-cooling channels. Various repairs have been tried over the years with no permanent success. Throughout all of this time, water samples have indicated copper oxide, CuO, as the source of the contamination. Matters came to a head in early 1997 following a major underground LCW leak between the Central Utilities Building and the Antiproton Rings enclosures. Over a span of several weeks following system turn-on, some twenty magnets overheated leading to unreliable Pbar source operation. Although it was known that oxygen in the system reacts with the copper tubing to form CuO, work to remedy this problem was not undertaken until this time period. Leaks, large quantities of make-up water, infrequent filter replacement, and thermal cycling also result in an increase in the corrosion product release rate. A three-pronged approach has been implemented to minimize the amount of copper oxide available to plug the magnets: (1) installation of an oxygen removal system capable of achieving dissolved oxygen concentrations in the parts per billion (ppb) range; (2) regular closed-loop filter/flushing of the copper headers and magnets and stainless steel header during down periods; and (3) installation of a full-flow filtration system designed to remove any CuO produced by the trace amounts of dissolved oxygen in the LCW system. All three items have been completed. The dissolved oxygen concentration is now routinely on the order of 15 ppb and returns to that level within 8 [...] 12 hours following an upset condition such as a leak. Prior to installation of the oxygen removal system, oxygen levels were approximately 3, 000 ppb. Particle analysis of the water before-and-after <b>filter</b> and <b>flushing</b> of the LCW system indicates a cleaner system.

The use of this oxygenator with or without integrated arterial filter was compared with a conventional oxygenator and nonintegrated centrifugal pump. To compare the air removal characteristics 60 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting were alternately assigned into one of three groups to be perfused with a minimized extracorporeal circuit either with the conventional oxygenator, the oxygenator with IP, or the oxygenator with IP plus integrated arterial filter (IAF). Air entering and leaving the three devices was measured accurately with a bubble counter during cardiopulmonary bypass. No significant differences between all groups were detected, considering air entering the devices. Our major finding was that in both integrated devices groups incidental spontaneous release of air into the arterial line in approximately 40 % of the patients was observed. Here, detectable bolus air (> 500 µm) was shown in the arterial line, whereas in the minimal extracorporeal circulation circuit (MECC) group this phenomenon was not present. We decided to conduct an amendment of the initial design with METC-approval. Ten patients were assigned to be perfused with an oxygenator with IP and IAF. Importantly, the integrated perfusion systems used in these patients were flushed with carbon dioxide (CO 2) prior to priming of the systems. In the group with CO 2 flush no spontaneous air release was observed in all cases and this was {{significantly different from the}} initial study with the group with the integrated device and IAF. This suggests that air spilling may be caused by residual air in the integrated device. In conclusion, integration of a blood pump may cause spontaneous release of large air bubbles (> 500 µm) into the arterial line, despite the presence of an integrated arterial <b>filter.</b> CO 2 <b>flushing</b> of an integrated cardiopulmonary bypass system prior to priming may prevent spontaneous air release and is strongly recommended to secure patient safet...|$|R

The pH-stat protein digestibility routine with shrimp hepatopancreas enzymes was previously related to apparent protein digestibility with juvenile Litopenaeus vannamei fed diets containing different protein ingredients. The potential of the method to predict culture performance of shrimp fed six commercial feeds (T 3, T 4, T 5, T 6, T 7 and T 8) with 350 g kg(- 1) declared crude-protein content was assessed. The consistency of results obtained using hepatopancreas enzyme extracts from either pond or clear water-raised shrimp was further verified in terms of reproducibility and possible diet history effects upon in vitro outputs. Shrimps were previously acclimated and then maintained over 56 days (initial mean weight 3. 28 g) on each diet in 500 -L tanks at 114 ind m(- 2), clear water closed system with continuous renewal and mechanical filtering (50 mu m), with four replicates per treatment. Feeds were offered four times daily (six days a week) delivered in trays at feeding rates ranging from 4. 0 % to 7. 0 % of stocked shrimp biomass. Feed was accessible to shrimp 4 h daily for 1 -h feeding period after which uneaten feed was recovered. Growth and survival were determined every 14 days from a sample of 16 individuals per tank. Water quality was monitored daily (pH, temperature and salinity) and managed by water back <b>flushing</b> <b>filter</b> cleaning every 7 - 10 days. Feeds were analysed for crude protein, gross energy, amino acids and pepsin digestibility. In vitro pH-stat degree of protein hydrolysis (DH%) was determined for each feed using hepatopancreas enzyme extracts from experimental (clear water) or pond-raised shrimp. Feeds resulted in significant differences in shrimp performance (P < 0. 05) as seen by the differences in growth rates (0. 56 - 0. 98 g week(- 1)), final weight and feed conversion ratio (FCR). Shrimp performance and in vitro DH% with pond-raised shrimp enzymes showed significant correlation (P < 0. 05) for yield (R- 2 = 0. 72), growth rates (R- 2 = 0. 72 - 0. 80) and FCR (R- 2 = - 0. 67). Other feed attributes (protein : energy ratio, amino acids, true protein, non-protein nitrogen contents and in vitro pepsin digestibility) showed none or limited correlation with shrimp culture performance. Additional correlations were found between growth rates and methionine (R- 2 = 0. 73), FCR and histidine (R- 2 = - 0. 60), and DH% and methionine or methionine+cystine feed contents (R- 2 = 0. 67 - 0. 92). pH-stat assays with shrimp enzymes generated reproducible DH% results with either pond (CV <= 6. 5 %) or clear water (CV <= 8. 5 %) hepatopancreas enzyme sources. Moreover, correlations between shrimp growth rates and feed DH% were significant regardless of the enzyme origin (pond or clear water-raised shrimp) and showed consistent R- 2 values.
