40|$|Hfq is a {{bacterial}} RNA chaperone {{involved in the}} riboregulation of diverse genes via small noncoding RNAs. Here, we show that Hfq is critical for the uropathogenic Proteus mirabilis to effectively colonize the bladder and kidneys in a murine urinary tract infection (UTI) model and to establish burned wound infection of the rats. In this regard, we found the hfq mutant induced higher IL- 8 and MIF levels of uroepithelial cells and displayed reduced intra-macrophage survival. The loss of hfq affected bacterial abilities to <b>handle</b> <b>H</b> 2 O 2 and osmotic pressures and to grow at 50 °C. Relative to wild-type, the hfq mutant had reduced motility, fewer flagella and less hemolysin expression and was less prone to form biofilm and to adhere to and invade uroepithelial cells. The MR/P fimbrial operon was almost switched to the off phase in the hfq mutant. In addition, we found the hfq mutant exhibited an altered outer membrane profile and had higher RpoE expression, which indicates the hfq mutant may encounter increased envelope stress. With the notion of envelope disturbance in the hfq mutant, we found increased membrane permeability and antibiotic susceptibilities in the hfq mutant. Finally, we showed that Hfq positively regulated the RpoS level and tolerance to H 2 O 2 in the stationary phase seemed largely mediated through the Hfq-dependent RpoS expression. Together, our data indicate that Hfq plays {{a critical role in}} P. mirabilis to establish UTIs by modulating stress responses, surface structures and virulence factors.

40|$|With the {{perspective}} to test drugs that may reduce pain due to surgical castration, this preliminary study {{tries to find}} out a robust and valid method for pain assessment in piglets. In the present study three treatments were applied: <b>handling</b> (<b>H),</b> tail docking (TD) and surgical castration + tail docking (CTD). To evaluate pain response to the treatments different variables were analyzed: movement latency (time from placing back the piglet inside the farrowing crate after treatments and its first movement towards the nest or the sow), rectal temperature and plasma cortisol and lactate levels. Movement latency was measured for all treatments. Rectal temperature was measured before treatments H and CTD, and 1, 3, 5, 24 hours later. Blood samples for cortisol and lactate determination were collected 1 hour before treatments H and CTD, right after and 3, 5, 24 hours later. The significant increase of movement latency for CTD compared to H showed that pain can be assessed by this type of measure. Rectal temperature was significantly affected by time (P < 0. 01) but not by treatment likely due to several factors that might have confounded the studied effect. Cortisol was significantly affected by interaction time*treatment (P < 0. 01) particularly due to the high peak for CTD right after the surgical procedure. Lactate was modified only by time (P < 0. 01).

H subjects were separated from the nest for 15 mins/day on post-natal days 1 - 14, while non-handled (NH) controls remained in the home cage. Adult BHR from each group were implanted with a femoral arterial catheter for mean arterial pressure (MAP) recording and blood sampling. Two days later, subjects were exposed to the fear conditioning procedure. Subjects were returned to the chamber the next day for 10 min during which time freezing behavior, CV responses and CORT measurements were taken. H subjects displayed significantly more freezing behavior compared to NH (92 %± 2. 2 vs. 80. 7 %± 5. 7, p <. 05). Although resting MAP did not differ between groups, H subjects had increased MAP reactivity when returned to the fear conditioning chamber (p <. 01). Finally, H subjects had significantly lower CORT levels at the end of the 10 min test period (173 ± 8 ng/ml vs. 217. 7 ± 22. 2 ng/ml, p <. 05). In a separate experiment, H subjects showed reduced CORT levels in response to acute restraint stress.

40|$|AbstractChanges in body {{temperature}} are significant physiological consequences of stressful stimuli in mammals and birds. Pigeons (Columba livia) prosper in (potentially) stressful urban environments and are common subjects in neurobehavioral studies; however, the thermal responses to stress stimuli by pigeons are poorly known. Here, we describe acute {{changes in the}} telemetrically recorded celomatic (core) temperature (Tc) in pigeons given a variety of potentially stressful stimuli, including transfer to a novel cage (ExC) leading to visual isolation from conspecifics, {{the presence of the}} experimenter (ExpR), gentle <b>handling</b> (<b>H),</b> sham intracelomatic injections (SI), and the induction of the tonic immobility (TI) response. Transfer to the ExC cage provoked short-lived hyperthermia (10 – 20 min) followed by a long-lasting and substantial decrease in Tc, which returned to baseline levels 2 h after the start of the test. After a 2 -hour stay in the ExC, the other potentially stressful stimuli evoked only weak, marginally significant hyperthermic (ExpR, IT) or hypothermic (SI) responses. Stimuli delivered 26 h after transfer to the ExC induced definite and intense increases in Tc (ExpR, H) or hypothermic responses (SI). These Tc changes appear to be unrelated to modifications in general activity (as measured via telemetrically recorded actimetric data). Repeated testing failed to affect the hypothermic responses to the transference to the ExC, even after nine trials and at 1 - or 8 -day intervals, suggesting that the social (visual) isolation from conspecifics may be a strong and poorly controllable stimulus in this species. The present data indicated that stress-induced changes in Tc may be a consistent and reliable physiological parameter of stress but that they may also show stressor type-, direction- and species-specific attributes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Early life stress predisposes to the {{development}} of psychi-atric disorders. In this context the hippocampal formation is of particu-lar interest, because it is affected by stress on the structural and cogni-tive level. Since little is known how early life stress is translated on the molecular level, we mimicked early life stress in mouse models and ana-lyzed the expression of the glycoprotein Reelin, a master molecule for development and differentiation of the hippocampus. From postnatal day 1 (P 1) to P 14, mouse pups were subjected to one of the following treatments: nonhandling (NH), <b>handling</b> (<b>H),</b> maternal separation (MS), and early deprivation (ED) followed by immediate (P 15) or delayed (P 70) real time RT-PCR analysis of reelin mRNA expression. We show that at P 15, reelin mRNA levels were significantly increased in male H and ED groups when compared with the NH group. In contrast, no stress-induced alterations of reelin mRNA expression were found in female animals. This sex difference in stress-mediated stimulation of reelin expression was maintained into adulthood, since at P 70 inter-group differences were still found in male, but not in female mice. On the cellular level, however, we did not find any significant differences in cell densities of Reelin-immunolabeled neurons between treatment groups or sexes, but an overall reduction of Reelin-expressing neurons in the adult hippocampus when compared to P 15. To address the ques-tion whether corticosterone mediates the stress-induced up-regulation of reelin gene expression, we used age-matched hippocampal slice cul-tures derived from male and female mouse pups. Quantitative determi-nation of mRNA levels revealed that corticosterone treatment signifi-cantly up-regulated reelin mRNA expression in male, but not in female hippocampi. Taken together, these results show a sex-specific regulation of reelin gene expression by early life experience, most likely mediated by corticosterone. VC 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

Blood samples were collected at - 30, - 10, + 1, + 20, + 40, + 60, + 120, and + 180 minutes. Serum cortisol concentrations were determined using a competitive immunoassay and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for each lamb. The following biochemical parameters were assayed for each animal at each time point: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK) and glucose (GLU). The time needed for total lesion resolution and weight gain of each animal was recorded. Orchiectomy elicits the greatest cortisol response, significantly greater than that seen in similarly handled controls (P≤ 0. 01), Burdizzo and scrotal ablation groups (P≤ 0. 05). The serum cortisol AUC was higher in the scrotal ablation group (P≤ 0. 05) than controls, but lower than in the orchiectomy group (P≤ 0. 05). The Burdizzo group didn’t differ from controls. Serum glucose levels of the castrated lambs differed significantly from the control group, following a trend similar to cortisol. No change was seen in ALT, AST, LDH or CK. No difference in weight gain was seen among the groups. Our results suggest that use of the Burdizzo is the preferable castration technique for adult lambs, while scrotal ablation is a valid surgical alternative to orchiectomy and permits more rapid wound healing that is ideal for extensive management where flocks are not under close observation...|$|R

The hippocampus exhibits plasticity in adulthood in response to diverse environmental factors associated with spatial demands placed on an animal. The medial and dorsal cortices of the telencephalon of squamate reptiles have been implicated as functional homologues to the hippocampus. This study sought to experimentally manipulate the navigational demands placed on free-ranging northern Pacific rattlesnakes (Crotalus o. oreganus) to provide direct evidence of the relationship between spatial demands and neuroplasticity in the cortical telencephalon of the squamate brain. Adult male rattlesnakes were radio-tracked for 2 months, during which time 1 of 3 treatments was imposed weekly, namely 225 -meter translocation in a random direction, 225 -meter walk and release at that day’s capture site (handling control) or undisturbed (control). Snakes were then sacrificed and the brains were removed and processed for histological analysis of cortical features. The activity range was larger in the translocated (Tr) group compared to the <b>handled</b> (<b>Hd)</b> and undisturbed control (Cn) groups when measured via 95 % minimum convex polygon (MCP). At the 100 % MCP level, Tr snakes had larger activity ranges than the Cn snakes only. The volume of the medial cortex (MC) was larger in the Tr group compared to the Cn group. The MC of Hd snakes was not significantly different from that of either of the other groups. No differences in dorsal cortex (DC) or lateral cortex volumes were detected among the groups. Numbers of 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) -labeled cells in the MC and DC 3 weeks after BrdU injection were not affected by treatment.
