500|$|While all {{advocates for}} {{elimination}} of Native mascots {{agree that the}} practice is morally wrong, many do not find a basis for legal remedy. Civil rights law in the United States reflect {{the difference between the}} experience of racism by African Americans and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The appropriation of native cultures is therefore seen as <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice</b> by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular African Americans, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the [...] "noble savage" [...] honors Native Americans.|$|E

2500|$|From a {{political}} scope {{one can also}} consider redlining and mortgage lenders. Redlining is a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice</b> that forces more inreal estate and all that attributes to it, typically involving lenders that refuse to lend money or extend credit to borrowers in certain areas of town. Although segregation and informal discrimination had existed in the United States since the Civil Rights movement, the specific practice called [...] "redlining" [...] began with the National Housing Act of1934, which established the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The Federal Housing Administration, generally known as [...] "FHA", provides mortgage insurance on loans made by FHA-approved lenders throughout the United States and its territories. In the 1960s, a sociologist named John McKnight coined the term [...] "redlining" [...] to describe the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice</b> of fencing off areas where banks would avoid investments based on community demographics. Areas most frequently discriminated against were blackinner city neighborhoods. Concentrated areas often suffer through {{the same type of}} discrimination based on other factors aside of color. Blacklistingis the action of a group or authority, compiling ablacklist(orblack list) of people, countries or other entities to be avoided or distrusted as not being acceptable to those making the list. Through the study of investigative reporterBill Dedmanshowed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle- or upper-income blacks.The implementation of this federal policy aggravated the decay of minority inner city neighborhoods caused by the withholding of mortgage capital, and made it even more difficult for neighborhoods to attract and retain families able to purchase homes.In addition, the Fair HousingAct, {{which is part of the}} Civil RightsActof 1968,prohibitsdiscrimination against neighborhoods based on their racial composition. Following aNational Housing Conferencein 1973, a group of Chicago community organizations led by The Northwest Community Organization (NCO) formedNational People's Action(NPA), to broaden the fight against disinvestment and mortgage redlining in neighborhoods all over the country.|$|E
2500|$|Allan Bérubé, {{the author}} of the book tilted [...] "Coming Out Under Fire: The History of Gay Men and Women in World War II" [...] was {{instrumental}} in bringing forth some of the ordeals of the men and women of the armed forces who had the vision to challenge, in the mid-1970s, the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice</b> followed in excluding them as they were gay. This received wide publicity as [...] "gays in the military" [...] and Allan Bérubé's campaign in San Francisco, started in the 1970s, culminated in establishing the San Francisco Lesbian and Gay History project, in 1978-79. Following the awareness created by this project, many ex-servicemen challenged their termination from the armed services which resulted only in further tightening the rules against gays by the armed services.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{limit to}} the duty to {{accommodate}} that {{is included in the}} CHRA is the notion of undue hardship. It signifies that the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice</b> can be justified if the duty holder demonstrates that the required accommodation weights too much on him. The undue hardship includes [...] "health, safety and cost." [...] Professor Christian Brunelle divides the evaluation criteria in three categories: the limits of financial and material resources of the company/institution, the breach of the victim’s rights, and the proper functioning of the company/institution. The judge also takes into account the reasonable feature of the controversial policy, rule or norm, the effort of accommodation by the duty holder, and the excessive feature of the constraint. Courts generally agree that the complainant has to take steps towards accommodation or “must either sacrifice his religious principles or his employment”.|$|E

2500|$|The {{prisoners were}} brought to court by 118 Alabama guardsmen, armed with machine guns. It was market day in Scottsboro, and farmers were in town to sell produce and buy supplies. Everyday was market day back in 1931. It was no {{different}} on Monday then it was on Sunday. [...] A crowd of thousands soon formed. Courthouse access required a permit due to the salacious nature of the testimony expected. As the Supreme Court later described this situation, [...] "the proceedings ... took place {{in an atmosphere of}} tense, hostile, and excited public sentiment." [...] For each trial, all-white juries were selected. There were few African Americans in the jury pool, as most had been disenfranchised {{since the turn of the}} century by a new state constitution and white <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice,</b> and were thus disqualified from jury service.|$|E
2500|$|Harassment and {{victimisation}} {{cannot be}} justified, but in principle {{there are exceptions}} or justifications for all forms of direct and indirect discrimination. Apart from direct age discrimination which can also be objectively justified, the general rule for direct discrimination, elaborated in EA 2010 Schedule 9, is that an employer may only be exempt if it can show that having a worker fit a particular description is a [...] "genuine occupational requirement". This means the (otherwise) <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice</b> must pursue a legitimate aim {{in terms of the}} nature of the occupation itself (not the employer's business needs generally) and the practice must be proportionate. The test is stringent. In Etam plc v Rowan a man was turned down for a job at a woman's clothing store, with the excuse that a man should not operate women's change rooms. But this did not count as a genuine occupational requirement because the shift allocation could have been easily changed. By contrast, it was held in Wolf v Stadt Frankfurt am Main that a requirement to be under 30 years old when joining the fire service could be a genuine occupational requirement, to ensure fitness. Controversially, the European Court of Justice has repeatedly said that it is within a member state's margin of discretion to say being male is a genuine occupational requirement for work in the military. This was even so, in Sirdar v The Army Board & Secretary of State for Defence, for a lady who applied to work as a chef in the Royal Marines, because the policy on [...] "interoperability" [...] meant every member had to be capable of combat. Cases involving religion are subject to a special provision, so that if a job's functions require adherence to an organisation's ethos, the organisation has an exemption from direct discrimination. In an action for judicial review of the legislation, Richards J rejected that a faith school would be exempt in any way, rather than an actual religious establishment like a church. Even there, it was rejected that a gay person could be dismissed from a job as a cleaner or bookshop worker, if that was incompatible with the religious [...] "ethos", because the ethos would not be a genuine requirement to carry out the job.|$|E
