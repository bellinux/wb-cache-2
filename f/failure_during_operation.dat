Progress, however, soon began to slow down, due to German resistance, lack of Allied manpower in Italy, and the formidable German defenses known as the Winter Line, which was to hold the Allies up for the next six months.|$|E

40|$|About 2500 superconducting sextupole {{corrector}} magnets (MCS) {{are needed}} for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN to compensate persistent current sextupole fields of the main dipoles. The MCS is a cold bore magnet with iron yoke. The coils are made from a NbTi conductor, which is cooled to 1. 9 K. In the original CERN design 6 individual sub-coils, made from a monolithic composite conductor, are assembled and spliced together to form the sextupole. The coils are individually wound around precision-machined central islands and stabilized with matching saddle pieces at both ends. The Advanced Magnet Lab, Inc.

In the AML design, the magnet consists of three splice-free sub-coils, which are placed with an automated winding process into pockets of prefabricated G- 11 support cylinders. Any assembly process of sub-coils with potential misalignment is eliminated. The AML magnet uses a Kapton-wrapped mini-cable, which allows helium penetration into {{the vicinity of the}} conductor, increasing its cryogenic stability.

Finite element modelling was employed {{in the analysis of}} the fatigue life of three lead-free solders (SAC 105, SAC 305, and SAC 405) under commercial thermal cycling load (between − 40 °C and 85 °C).

The catering hi-lift is one of the aircraft ground support equipment that is commonly used to service commercial airliners. For the design to be approved by the Department of Safety and Health (DOSH) Malaysia under Hoisting Machine Design according to DS- 149 Standard, it must comply with specific engineering design standard.

Focusing on the deflection accordance to the ANSI Standard; calculation regarding the allowable maximum deflection must not be exceeded. To analyze, manual calculations, solid modeling and computer simulations were involved using state-of-the-art CAE software. Several linear static FEA analyses were done to get accurate results.
