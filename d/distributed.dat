5|$|<b>Distributed</b> element {{filters are}} mostly used at {{frequencies}} above the VHF (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 MHz). At these frequencies, the physical length of passive components {{is a significant}} fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional lumped element model. The exact point at which <b>distributed</b> element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common {{rule of thumb is}} to apply <b>distributed</b> element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a <b>distributed</b> element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher {{as a result of these}} advances. On the other hand, antenna structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the <b>distributed</b> element model.|$|E
5|$|Grid {{computing}} is {{the most}} <b>distributed</b> form of parallel computing. It makes use of computers communicating over the Internet {{to work on a}} given problem. Because of the low bandwidth and extremely high latency available on the Internet, <b>distributed</b> computing typically deals only with embarrassingly parallel problems. Many <b>distributed</b> computing applications have been created, of which SETI@home and Folding@home are the best-known examples.|$|E

5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or <b>distributed</b> memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). <b>Distributed</b> memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically <b>distributed,</b> but often implies that it is physically <b>distributed</b> as well. <b>Distributed</b> shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access to the memory on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E

5|$|<b>Distributed</b> element {{filters are}} used {{in many of the}} same {{applications}} as lumped element filters, such as selectivity of radio channel, bandlimiting of noise and multiplexing of many signals into one channel. <b>Distributed</b> element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements (low-pass, band-pass, etc.) with the exception of high-pass, which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) can be implemented using a <b>distributed</b> element approach.|$|E

40|$|In {{parallel}} {{logic programming}} systems that exploit both and-parallelism and or-parallelism, a problem arises {{that is how}} to <b>distribute</b> processors between the dynamically varying amounts of and-work and or-work that are available.
