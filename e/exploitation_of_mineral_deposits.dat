The development of aggregate production is conditioned by a number of factors.

While identifying and assessing the environmental impacts of manufacturing aggregates one may distinguish those environmental aspects that have or may have the greatest magnitude of the impact on the environment as a result of industrial activities. Manufacturers producing aggregates located in the areas covered by the special environmental protection require extra diligence in the conduct of mining activities for preservation of natural resources. The article discusses some main environmental aspects of the production of construction aggregates on the example of one of the largest producers of this material in Subcarpathian province of Poland.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> {{negatively}} affects the environment. In the case of underground mining, there are usually the most serious effects which are associated with mining activities: movements and surface deformations lead to the creation of subsidence depressions. The determination of the actual state of surface changes by conventional surveying methods is technically exacting, time-consuming and very expensive. With the development of geo-information technologies, new approaches arise and they can be applied to resolving this issue. These resources seem to be suitable not only for providing the necessary spatial information on ongoing processes, but also for their subsequent processing and comprehensive evaluation. The presented paper deals with the possibilities of applying geo-information technologies for monitoring and evaluating the effects of underground mining on surface, summarizes the actual state of this research at ICT, and offers alternatives for their use in the future.

Although mining incidents as a result of dam failures are very conspicuous, chronic problems related to waters from mining voids and tailings are also very significant. In that sense, though mine waters {{are an integral part of}} the water cycle, they are rarely regulated as such. Ongoing discussions with Member States and stakeholders are focusing on mining wastes rather than mine water. Regulating only mine waste handling facilities and ignoring the mine voids would in many cases miss the main long-term pollutant source. Planned changes in EU environmental legislation with regard to mining cannot be properly understood outside of worldwide developments in this area. Adequate management of applied scientific research initiatives and policy formulation is crucial to satisfactory outcomes at EU and global levels. At the EU level, this interface is exemplified by the nature and anticipated outcomes of two EU-funded research projects (ERMITE and PIRAMID). Ways in which policy-focused deliverables are being developed by these projects, which interface science, engineering, and policy, are highlighted.

40|$|The {{uncontrolled}} extraction <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> resources {{is considered one}} of the major anthropogenic sources of soil pollution. In Spain, <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> metallic <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> and its subsequent abandonment in last decades has lead to significant environmental hazard for natural systems. In this research, potentially contaminated soils surrounding an old chalcopyrite mine district in Madrid (Central Spain) have been studied. The focus is to assess the degree of pollution by heavy metals and other trace elements as a consequence of the extraction and treatment of sulphides for several centuries. For this purpose, 15 soil samples were collected considering the distance to the source of pollution and the soil depth. The soil heavy metals speciation was determined using the BCR sequential extraction procedure (Community Bureau of Reference, European Commission) and analysed by ICP-MS for 14 elements. The total contents of these elements have been calculated as the sum of the four BCR fractions. The results showed heavy metals concentrations decreasing with the distance from the source of pollution. The highest amounts of these elements (mg¿kg- 1) were found at sites close to livestock pastures (As 80 ± 2; Cu 1679 ± 13; Cd 5. 5 ± 0. 1; Co 867 ± 12). These values exceed the allowed limits of the local environmental regulation. Moreover, the amounts (mg¿kg- 1) of some trace elements associated with the bioavailable fraction of the soil are high (Cu 419 ± 5; Cd 3. 6 ± 0. 1), suggesting that further research is needed for a better evaluation of the potential risk of contamination dispersion and the consequences of this process on the whole ecosystem.

40|$|A {{model of}} the {{sequence}} of decisions required for mine development and production has been formulated and is operated as a computer-based game. The Mine Manager is an operations research game in which the user assumes the role of mine management in the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit.</b> Potential applications <b>of</b> the game lie in experimentation, policy formulation and education in mine economics. The Mine Manager is described using the terminology of games. The selection of parameters and {{of the level of}} detail in the model reflects a compromise between realism and simplicity. At the development stage, the selection of project specifications concerns the mining method and capacity installation. Decisions on cut-off grade and/or cut-off value, capacity utilization, the sequence of mining, stockpiling and expansion are made during the mine life. Decision making takes place within a framework provided by an abstraction of the operating environment of a mine, and must comply with a set of rules. These rules ensure that only feasible decisions are made. Within this constraint, the model offers a high degree of flexibility in setting the values of the decision variables. The Mine Manager combines elements of geology, mining, management and gaming. Conditional simulation is used to generate grades of copper, zinc and gold in a massive sulphide deposit. Mining operations in both underground and open-pit mines are modelled, and hypothetical capital and operating cost functions are developed for the mine and mill. A pricing model generates new price series for each run of the game. The Mine Manager is operated interactively on a microcomputer through the use of modular software.

40|$|In {{recent years}} we have {{observed}} the global growing interest in undersea <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits.</b> Research on various concepts of operating systems on the seabed has been conducted, where different methods of transporting excavated material from the bottom to the surface are used. Great depths, where there are the most interesting resources (eg. IOM lot for the Clarion-Clipperton 4500 m) set very high technical and technological demands which results in intensive search for solutions. The authors of the paper want to explain {{the concept of the}} use of pyrotechnic materials for transportation in the aquatic environment. The presented method is designed for the cyclic transport from great depths (less than 200 m from the seabed). The principle of operation of the relay unit is based on the change in the average density of the entire module which is inseparably connected with the force of buoyancy acting on the submerged body. Changing the density of the whole module to the given depth of immersion is strictly dependent on the amount of energy supplied to the system by a power source {{in the form of a}} controlled pyrotechnic reaction. However, during the ascent energy demand decreases. The problem of transport of spoil from depth not only boils down to such considerations as initiation of the process of ascent. One should also consider how to use the excess energy occurring during the movement of the object toward the surface.

40|$|Extract] Classification and {{allocation}} of land-use {{is a major}} policy objective in most countries. Such an undertaking, however, {{in the face of}} competing demands from different stakeholders, requires reliable information on resources potential. This type of information enables policy decision-makers to estimate socio-economic benefits from different possible land-use types and then to allocate most suitable land-use. The potential for several types of resources occurring on the earth's surface (e. g., forest, soil, etc.) is generally easier to determine than those occurring in the subsurface (e. g., mineral deposits, etc.). In many situations, therefore, information on potential for subsurface occurring resources is not among the inputs to land-use decision-making [85]. Consequently, many potentially mineralized lands are alienated usually to, say, further exploration and <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits.</b> Areas with mineral potential are characterized by geological features associated genetically and spatially with the type of mineral deposits sought. The term 'mineral deposits' means. accumulations or concentrations of one or more useful naturally occurring substances, which are otherwise usually distributed sparsely in the earth's crust. The term 'mineralization' refers to collective geological processes that result in formation of mineral deposits. The term 'mineral potential' describes the probability or favorability for occurrence of mineral deposits or mineralization. The geological features characteristic of mineralized land, which are called recognition criteria, are spatial objects indicative of or produced by individual geological processes that acted together to form mineral deposits. Recognition criteria are sometimes directly observable; more often, their presence is inferred from one or more geographically referenced (or spatial) datasets, which are processed and analyzed appropriately to enhance, extract, and represent the recognition criteria as spatial evidence or predictor maps. Mineral potential mapping then involves integration of predictor maps in order to classify areas of unique combinations of spatial predictor patterns, called unique conditions [51] as either barren or mineralized with respect to the mineral deposit-type sought...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Open-cut {{excavations}} {{formed as}} a result of <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> are the least studied ecological sites. Habitat het-erogenity is reflected by remarkable floristic and phytocoenotic diversity. Being isolated by the sur-rounding vegetation of contrasting types – they can be considered as “habitat islands”. Twenty excavations (area from 100 m 2 to 2 ha) were selected – 10 located in cropland, 10 – in coniferous forest. The intensiveness of gravel pit exploitation was differentiated. Some of them were exploited, other ones were abandoned 10 – 30 years ago. The floristic records were taken during summer period in each pit and in near-by vegeta-tion at the distance not larger than 200 m. As much as 280 species of vascular plants were found in 10 selected gravel pits surrounded by coniferous forest communities, which con-tained only 111 taxa. The flora of mid-field exca-vations was definitely richer that the flora of their surroundings. Sörensen’s similarity index (So) for mid-forest gravel pits and their surroundings ranged between 27 % and 40 % while that for mid-field gravel pits and their neighbourhood – from 15 % to over 27 %. The U Mann-Whitney test demonstrated that the number of species noted in selected gravel pits significantly differed from that in the surrounding. It was true for both (mid-forest Z = 3. 70; P = 0. 00021) and mid-field gravel pits (Z = 3. 78; P = 0. 00016). Native species were dominating in the flora of both mid-field and mid-forest excavations (77 % and 82 % respectively). Hemicryptophytes were found to dominate (46 %) over other groups of life forms in both types of gravel pits. A high contribution of terophytes – over 19 % in mid-for-est excavations and over 25 % in mid-field ones is noteworthy. The results showed that gravel pits could play a role of enclaves for natural and semi-natural vegetation thus acting as local centres of floristic diversity in human modified monotonous agri-cultural or monospecies pine forest landscape.

40|$|The term geometallurgy (or geometallurgical) first {{appeared}} in the literature some 40 years ago and has a wide range of definitions and perspectives which increases the barriers of communication between practitioners and across functional groups and management levels within organisations. However the consistent theme running through the diversity of definitions and perspectives is the requirement for close collaboration between the relevant disciplines. This concept of geometallurgy arguably goes back to the earliest days of the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits,</b> through the mid- 1500 s {{to the beginning of the}} 20 th century. This holistic and integrated view was diminished during the 20 th century due to a number of factors which included the commencement and continuing upward trend of large-scale mining and the expansion in production, the rise of scientific and classical management theories and methodologies, increase in specialisation and the development of traditional project planning. The re-emergence of geometallurgy in the late 20 th century required the relevant functional units and disciplines to collaborate as a team. This necessitates a common understanding that the geometallurgical program 2 ̆ 7 s goals must be obtained, which requires clear and consistent communication, particularly with the modern trend of virtual teams. A multi-dimensional construct is proposed to assist in providing a consistent approach in the communication of the context and purpose of both general and specific geometallurgical programs, thus simplifying communication. This geometallurgical construct consists of the dimensions of process span, response knowledge, variability knowledge, spatial knowledge, application and project phase in relation to extraction process(es) applied to geological materials from a mineral deposit. These dimensions are then linked to the phase of mineral project development in which the geometallurgical program is being applied, which ranges from advanced exploration through to operational execution.

40|$|Mineral {{exploration}} is a {{risky business}} due to the inherent geological and economic uncertainties that accompany the discovery and <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits.</b> Consequently, the ability to quantify the risk {{in terms of the}} economic consequences of exploration can lead to improved decision-making and more profitable exploration. Quantifying economic risk in exploration requires an understanding of the economic value of exploration. This in turn requires information about possible numbers and sizes of undiscovered deposits, in addition to the economics associated with the discovery, delineation and mining of these undiscovered deposits. A method for quantifying exploration risk based on these requirements is detailed here and demonstrated via a four part case study, which examines the economic risk associated with exploration for undiscovered porphyry Cu and VHMS deposits in the Yarrol region (SE Queensland) and their contained copper and gold resources. The first part of the case study outlines the study rationale and background, and presents descriptive geological models for eastern Australian porphyry Cu and VHMS deposits. The deposit models were then used to delineate permissive tracts for each deposit type. In the second part, prospectivity modelling was carried out on a sub-block basis using a multivariate Bayesian weighted probabilistic neural network (PNN). The PNN was used to integrate geological data and estimate the conditional probability that a sub-block belonged to one of twelve classes, defined by a set of mineral deposit types. Prior to modelling, the geological data used in the PNN underwent preparation that involved quality control and conversion to a set of geological themes which accentuate characteristics associated with mineralisation in the Yarrol region. To compensate for inherent imprecision in the data, fuzzy set algorithms were used to sample the themes prior to PNN modelling. The algorithms were designed to handle the line, polygon and raster data using fuzzy membership functions and fuzzy entropy. The final PNN input vector contained 50 fuzzy variables, describing lithology, structure and geophysics. Because the PNN is an intrinsic classifier, which uses the training samples as nodes in the network, independent validation with classified samples not used in training is required to appropriately gauge performance. To overcome the issue of excluding classified samples from training, multiple PNN tests were carried out using randomly selected 70 : 30, training to validation, splits of the classified samples. In the case study 100 PNN tests were carried out and independent validation recorded a mean of 84 % correct classifications, with 4 % standard deviation. After each PNN test, unclassified subblocks covering the case study region were classified by the trained PNN and the results used to map the prospectivity of the region. The prospectivity maps highlighted both geological features and areas prospective for the different mineral classes. A total of 26 areas were modelled as being prospective for porphyry Cu and VHMS deposits of which 6 corresponded to the deposits used in training. In the third part of the case study, estimates of the undiscovered mineral resources in the Yarrol region were modelled using a Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation involved generating grade and tonnage models for eastern Australian porphyry Cu and VHMS deposits, and estimating the numbers of undiscovered deposits in the region using the probabilities generated by prospectivity modelling. Models and estimates were converted to cumulative distribution functions using histogram smoothing and normal score transformation. This approach differs from the documented proportional method and the benefits of using the new approach, such as better fitting and more representative grade and tonnage models, are shown. Results of the mineral resource simulation found that the simulated Cu resources in undiscovered VHMS deposits were much smaller than those estimated in undiscovered porphyry Cu deposits (i. e. Kt rather than Mt) while the probabilities for VMHS resources were an order of magnitude higher. For example, there was a 30 % chance of 100 Kt or more Cu in a VHMS deposit compared to a 2 % chance of 1 Mt or more Cu in an undiscovered porphyry Cu deposit. However, in the case of undiscovered Au resources the VHMS deposits had similar resource sizes to the porphyry Cu deposits but the probabilities were much higher for VHMS deposits (e. g. there was a 2 % chance of 5 Moz of Au, or more, in a porphyry Cu deposit and a 15 % chance of 5 Moz of Au, or more, in a VHMS deposit). These results reflected the high probability (i. e. 92 % chance) for zero undiscovered porphyry deposits and much higher Au grades in the VHMS deposits. In the final part of the case study the mid-term value (mine value) and the long-term value of exploration were estimated in terms of NPV and RoR. The mid-term values were calculated using mining cost models based on mining capacity calculated via Taylor’s rule. A new approach using variable mine capacity and scheduled development costs is presented and demonstrated. Results for the mid-term values indicate that economic risk was lower for resources in VHMS deposits. For example, the expected NPV 1 for an undiscovered porphyry Cu deposit was $ 27 million compared to $ 53 million for a VHMS deposit and the probabilities of these occurring were 0. 03 (a 3 % chance) and 0. 2 (a 20 % chance), respectively. However, a risk assessment using utilities for the mid-term NPV indicated that a risk taker would favour porphyry Cu exploration because of the possibility for extremely large porphyry deposits. The long term value of exploration was estimated using an exploration model that randomly sampled both a discovery cost model (which mapped the cost of exploration to the probability of a discovery) and the simulated undiscovered resources (which act as possible targets for exploration). A range of exploration budgets were examined for both deposit types. Results demonstrated that smaller budgets had higher risk because they resulted in longer discovery times which reduce profits and increased the chance of missed economic opportunities due to Gambler’s Ruin (e. g. a budget of $ 2 million/year had a 50 % of Gambler’s Ruin after 6 years, whereas a $ 6 million/year budget had only a 3 % chance). It was also shown that economic returns levelled out as the budget increased because the increased chance of making a discovery is balanced out by higher exploration costs and lower discounted returns for the discovered deposit. Small and large exploration budgets were examined in detail and it was shown that in both cases exploration for VHMS deposits has less risk. For example 1, a $ 2 million/year exploration budget targeting VHMS deposits had a 13 % chance of returning a NPV of $ 50 million, or greater, whereas the same budget targeting porphyry Cu deposits had only a 3 % chance of returning the same NPV, or greater. The RoR results displayed a similar outcome. The case study concluded with a sensitivity study examining the effects that variation in Cu price, Au price, exchange rate, mean exploration cost, development costs and operating costs has on the long-term economic values for both deposits types. In the case of porphyry Cu deposits both the NPV and RoR were highly sensitive to variations in Cu price {{and to a lesser extent}} operating and development costs. The long-term value of VHMS exploration was highly sensitive to the Cu price, Au price and the exchange rate. (the latter related to commodity prices and mining costs). It is recommended that future prospectivity studies could include geochemical and alteration data to assist in modelling the location of an undiscovered deposit. The use of historical exploration data (e. g. drill hole density maps) in the prospectivity modelling process would also help to identify areas that either lack detailed exploration or have been extensively explored. The use of more localised mining costs models, incorporating real Australian mine development and production costs is also recommended. Probably the most important recommendation deals with improvements to the exploration model such as the use of more accurate exploration costs and staged exploration processes. It is also suggested that other economic risk analysis techniques (i. e. portfolio analyses, capital asset fixing etc.) could be used to model the exploration process...|$|E

In general, two main approaches can be used to detect the presence <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> near or beneath the ground surface. One employs a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> model and the other aims at the identification of a primary halo about a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit.</b> A <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> model provides systematic empirical (descriptive) and/or theoretical (genetic) descriptions of the essential geological, geochemical and geophysical features of a type <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> (cf. Cox and Singer, 1986 and Roberts et al., 1988). The primary halo <b>of</b> a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit,</b> as defined originally by Safronov (1936), is ‘an area including rock, surrounding <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> (ore bodies) and enriched elements that make up that deposit’. Thus, descriptions of primary haloes may form part <b>of</b> a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> model, but both deposit model and primary halo approaches to mineral exploration are based on studies of primary geochemical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> because chemical processes during mineralization are the ones that ultimately bring about metal precipitation or mineral formation. However, a deposit model approach to mineral exploration is apt for identifying 'which haystacks contain a needle' whereas a primary halo approach to mineral exploration is proper for deducing 'where in a needle-bearing haystack is the needle located'...|$|R

40|$|Extract] Geochemistry is an {{important}} field in the study <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> because mineralization involves several processes, of which chemical processes {{are the ones that}} finally result in the precipitation of metals or formation <b>of</b> <b>minerals.</b> Studying the geochemical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> is, therefore, important in: (a) understanding ore genesis (the usage of term 'ore' here does not necessarily mean a <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> that can be exploited at an economic profit); (b) <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> classification; (c) <b>mineral</b> exploration; (d) extractive metallurgy or mineral processing; and (e) geo-environmental studies. Understanding the genesis and classification <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> have traditionally been carried out together (cf. Westra & Keith 1981; Hitzman et al. 2003; Dill 2010). Knowledge of various geological processes relevant to the <b>mineral</b> <b>deposit</b> formation provides a conceptual framework for the application of geocomputational technique for generating mineral exploration targets (cf. Bonham-Carter 1994; Porwal & Kreuzer 2010; Carranza 2011 a). Knowledge of ore genesis is important in developing geoenvironmetal models for <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits</b> (Seal & Foley 2002). Cabri (1988) and Clout (2003) have demonstrated the relevance of understanding of the genesis of ore deposits in providing guidance for mineral processing and metal extraction. Thus, of the different fields of application of geochemical characterization <b>of</b> <b>mineral</b> <b>deposits,</b> understanding ore genesis is the most important because it provides information that is essential to the other applications...|$|R
