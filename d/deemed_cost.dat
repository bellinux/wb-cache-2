25|$|In the 1960s, {{signs of}} a {{structural}} crisis in the Soviet system began to emerge. Azerbaijan's crucial oil industry lost its relative importance in the Soviet economy, partly because of a shift of oil production to {{other regions of the}} Soviet Union and partly because of the depletion of known oil resources accessible from land, while offshore production was not <b>deemed</b> <b>cost</b> effective. As a result, Azerbaijan had the lowest rate of growth in productivity and economic output among the Soviet republics, with the exception of Tajikistan. Ethnic tensions, particularly between Armenians and Azerbaijanis began to grow, but violence was suppressed. In an attempt to end the growing structural crisis, the government in Moscow appointed Heidar Aliyev as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Azerbaijan in 1969. Aliyev temporarily improved economic conditions and promoted alternative industries to the declining oil industry, such as cotton. He also consolidated the republic's ruling elite, which now consisted almost entirely of ethnic Azerbaijanis, thus reverting the previous trends of sblizheniye. In 1982 Aliyev was made a member of the Communist Party's Politburo in Moscow. In 1987, when Perestroika was implemented, he was forced to retire by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, whose reform policies he opposed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{addresses}} two {{potential problems}} that arise when measuring Farrell cost efficiency using linear programming methods. First, when an optimal {{solution to the}} cost function allows slack in the output constraints that define the technology {{it is possible to}} increase at least one output without increasing costs. Therefore, two firms might be <b>deemed</b> equally <b>cost</b> efficient even though one firm produces more of at least one output. Second, previous research has shown that when input prices vary across firms, it is possible for firms with higher <b>costs</b> to be <b>deemed</b> more <b>cost</b> efficient than firms who have lower costs. We present a new measure of cost efficiency that accounts for both of these potential problems. We illustrate our method using data on Japanese securities firms operating in the 2004 to 2006...|$|R

This permission was restricted to {{the year of the}} initial {{adoption of}} the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), while its use was prohibited for subsequent periods. As the monetary update {{of the cost of the}} companies non-monetary assets had been revoked more than a decade earlier, the {{adoption of the}} <b>deemed</b> <b>cost</b> would signal a possibility of value recomposition and that this possibility could alter the magnitude of the structural indicators of the companies’ equity status.

40|$|AbstractArchitectural {{heritage}} conservation {{is an important}} field in architectural research. The Hui-style vernacular dwelling is an essential architectural heritage of China. Its hollow wall system, with horsehead-like upper corners, is a distinct architectural feature that is worth preserving. However, the thermal performance of the hollow wall is relatively poor by today's standard. The current study developed a novel approach, whereby foam concrete was used to fill the voids inside the hollow wall to improve its thermal resistance. This approach was <b>deemed</b> <b>cost</b> effective, easy to learn, and capable of preserving the architectural integrity of the wall. Different types of foam concrete were prepared and tested. Testing {{results showed that the}} material properties of foam concrete are suitable for thermally upgrading the hollow wall system. Climate chamber testing was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed thermal upgrading strategy. The testing results suggested that filling the voids with foam concrete can effectively improve the overall thermal resistance of the hollow wall system by 24 %, which is almost equal to the overall thermal resistance when using the more expensive commercial inorganic stucco system...|$|E
40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the cost {{effectiveness}} of the current Irish programme of universal BCG vaccination of infants versus a programme which considered selectively vaccinating high risk infants using decision analytical modelling. Methods: The efficacy of the BCG vaccine was re-evaluated to inform a decision analytical model constructed to follow a birth cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated infants over a 15 year time horizon. The number of life years gained (LYG) was the primary outcome measure and this was compared to the net cost of the vaccination strategies. Results: In the base case analysis, the incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the universal strategy and selective strategy vs no vaccination were € 204, 373 /LYG and € 143, 233 /LYG respectively. When comparing the incremental difference in moving from the universal to the selective strategy, the selective strategy costs € 1, 055, 692 less per 4. 8 life years lost per birth cohort. One way sensitivity analyses highlighted that a move from the universal to the selective strategy was particularly sensitive to the estimate of vaccine efficacy against deaths, the cost of administering the vaccine and the multiplier used to apportion risk of contracting tuberculosis. Probabilistic analysis suggested that a move from a universal based strategy to a selective based strategy could be <b>deemed</b> <b>cost</b> effective (probability of cost effectiveness is 76. 8 %). Conclusion: The results of the study support the protective effect of the BCG vaccine in infants and quantified the cost effectiveness of the current BCG vaccination strategy and the decremental difference in moving to a selective strategy. This analysis highlights that the additional protection offered by the universal vaccination strategy is small compared to that of the selective strategy. Consideration should therefore be given to the implementation of a selective vaccination strategy, and diverting resources to improve TB case management and control...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{in order to}} obtain an understanding of how Namibia in general, and the education sector in particular, deal with flood emergencies. The goal of the National Policy for Disaster Risk Management in Namibia (2009) is “to contribute to the attainment of sustainable development in line with Namibia’s Vision 2030 through strengthening national capacities to significantly reduce disaster risk and built community resilience to disasters” (Republic of Namibia, 2009). This goal was the starting point for determining {{the extent to which the}} Ministry of Education complies with these national standards, and for gauging, in the light of responses to flood emergencies so far, the Ministry’s preparedness and response capacities, in line with international frameworks that Namibia has ratified. This qualitative study is situated within the theory of resilience, and sustainable resilience particularly. To obtain some of the information sought, a non-probability sampling method was used to ‘hand-pick’ subjects within the Ministry of Education to be interviewed at their respective locations, nationally and regionally. Five education officials who were intimately involved in past responses to flood emergencies were interviewed – three in Oshana and Ohangwena Regions, and two at Head Office in Windhoek – by means of a semi-structured interview. In addition, a literature review was conducted. The conclusions drawn from both the literature review and the information obtained from the respondents accord with the research problem identified: the Ministry of Education does not appear to be adequately prepared for, and does not assign the necessary priority to deal with, flood emergencies in particular. Possible recommendations for uptake within the Ministry of Education include: • mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction at all decentralized levels; • sensitizing all education officials, school community members and relevant stakeholders to policy frameworks and accountability structures to strengthen resilience within school communities; • <b>deeming</b> <b>costed</b> contingency planning a priority, and hence strengthening links between decentralized regional structures; and • continuously monitoring implementation of designed interventions...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, I {{include three}} essays {{regarding}} earnings forecasts, the DuPont analysis and tax expense, all using mandatory International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption in Canada as a setting. In the first essay entitled “DuPont Analysis, Earnings Persistence and Return on Equity: Evidence from Mandatory IFRS Adoption in Canada”, I propose four new models to forecast one-year-ahead {{return on equity}} and change in return on equity based on prior research in the DuPont analysis and earnings persistence. I also examine whether the persistence of return on equity has improved since Canadian companies adopted IFRS in 2011. In the second essay entitled “Information Content of Tax Expense and the Effect of IFRS Adoption on Tax Expense”, I examine the information content of tax expense about future profitability {{and the effect of}} IFRS adoption on tax expense. Prior studies (Lev and Nissim, 2004; Hanlon, 2005; Schmidt, 2006; Ayers et al., 2009) use estimated taxable income, book-tax differences and effective tax rates to investigate the relation between income taxes and future earnings. However, those estimated proxies contain measurement errors and might distort the relationship among variables. Tax expense including current, deferred and other income taxes is directly derived from a Compustat account with no estimation error. The main analysis and robustness tests show that tax expense contains more incremental information content about future profitability beyond pre-tax book income than estimated taxable income. In the third essay entitled “Impact of IFRS Adoption, Value Relevance and Industry Effects: A Canadian Study”, I propose a new comparability index to examine the impact of IFRS adoption on the financial statements of firms from different industries. The study demonstrates that <b>deemed</b> <b>cost</b> of property, plant and equipment is the optional exemption that caused the most discrepancy among first-time IFRS adopters; and that only transitional adjustments related to income accounts are value relevant...|$|E
40|$|Ecodriving is a {{collection}} of changes to driving behavior and vehicle maintenance designed to impact fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in existing vehicles. Because of its promise to improve fuel economy within the existing fleet, ecodriving has gained increased attention in North America. One strategy to improve ecodriving is through public education with information on how to ecodrive. This report provides a review and study of ecodriving from several angles. The report offers a literature review of previous work and programs in ecodriving across the world. In addition, researchers completed interviews with experts in the field of public relations and public message campaigns to ascertain best practices for public campaigns. Further, the study also completed a set of focus groups evaluating consumer response to a series of websites that displayed ecodriving information. Finally, researchers conducted a set of surveys, including a controlled stated-response study conducted with approximately 100 University of California, Berkeley faculty, staff, and students, assessing the effectiveness of static ecodriving web-based information as well as an intercept clipboard survey in the San Francisco Bay Area. The stated-response study consisted of a comparison of the experimental and control groups. It found that exposure to ecodriving information influenced people’s driving behavior and some maintenance practices. The experimental group’s distributional shift was statistically significant, particularly for key practices including: lower highway cruising speed, driving behavior adjustment, and proper tire inflation. Within the experimental group (N = 51), fewer respondents significantly changed their maintenance practices (16 %) than the majority that altered some driving practices (71 %). This suggests intentionally altering driving behavior is easier than planning better maintenance practices. While it was evident that not everyone modifies their behavior as a result of reviewing the ecodriving website, even small shifts in behavior due to inexpensive information dissemination could be <b>deemed</b> <b>cost</b> effective in reducing fuel consumption and emissions...|$|E
40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is a major}} healthcare concern {{from both}} a treatment and a funding perspective. Although decision makers frequently rely on models to evaluate the long-term costs and consequences associated with diabetes interventions, no recent article has reviewed the methods used in long-term cost-effectiveness models of diabetes treatment. The following databases were searched up to April 2008 to identify published economic models evaluating treatments for diabetes mellitus: OVID MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Thomson's Biosis Previews, NHS EED via Wiley's Cochrane Library, and Wiley's HEED database. Identified articles were reviewed and grouped according to unique models. When a model was applied in different settings (e. g. country) or compared different treatment alternatives, only the original publication describing the model was included. In some cases, subsequent articles were included if they provided methodological advances from the original model. The following data were captured for each study: (i) study characteristics; (ii) model structure; (iii) long-term complications, data sources, methods reporting and model validity; (iv) utilities, data sources and methods reporting; (v) costs, data sources and methods reporting; (vi) model data requirements; and (vii) economic results including methods to deal with uncertainty. A total of 17 studies were identified, 12 of which allowed {{for the conduct of}} a cost-effectiveness analysis and a cost-utility analysis. Although most models were Markov-based microsimulations, models differed with respect to the number of diabetes-related complications included. The majority of the studies used a lifetime time horizon and a payer perspective. The DCCT for type 1 diabetes and the UKPDS for type 2 diabetes were the trial data sources most commonly cited for the efficacy data, although several non-randomized data sources were used. While the methods used to derive the efficacy data were commonly reported, less information was given regarding the derivation of the utilities or the costs. New interventions were generally <b>deemed</b> <b>cost</b> effective based on ten studies presenting results. Authors relied mostly on univariate sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of their models. Although diabetes is a complex disease, several models have been developed to predict the long-term costs and consequences associated with diabetes treatment. Combined with previous findings, this review supports the development of a reference case {{that could be used for}} any new diabetes models. Models could be enhanced if they had the capacity to deal with both first- and second-order uncertainty. Future research should continue to compare economic models for diabetes treatment in terms of clinical outcomes, costs and QALYs when applicable.
