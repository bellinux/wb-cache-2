5000|$|Various {{methods are}} used to attach the socket or {{accessory}} to the anvil, such as a spring-loaded pin that snaps into a matching hole in the socket, preventing the socket being removed until an object is used to depress the pin, a <b>hog</b> <b>ring</b> which holds the socket by friction or by snapping into indents machined into the socket, and a through-hole, where a pin is inserted completely through the socket and anvil, locking the socket on. Hog rings are used on most smaller tools, with though-hole used only on larger impact wrenches, typically ¾" [...] drive or greater. Pin retainers used to be more common, but seem to be being replaced by hog rings on most tools, {{despite the lack of}} a positive lock. ¼" [...] female hex drive is becoming increasingly popular for small impact wrenches, especially cordless electric versions, allowing them to fit standard screwdriver tips rather than sockets.|$|E
50|$|The Marion Steam Shovel Company was {{established}} by Henry Barnhart, George W. King and Edward Huber in August 1884. While steam shovels had been made prior to this date in the United States, Barnhart persuaded Huber to financially back his design, which incorporated a stronger bucket support than other makes. Barnhart and Huber patented Barnhart's changes under United States Patent No. 285,100 on September 18, 1883. One element of Barnhart's design {{was the use of}} solid iron rods (<b>hog</b> <b>rings)</b> to support the boom of the shovel, which was stronger than simple chain.|$|R
50|$|The seaming or joining of geonets is difficult. Assuming stress {{does not}} have to be {{transferred}} from one roll to the next, plastic electrical ties, threaded loops, and wires have all been used with a relatively small overlaps of 50 100 mm. Metal <b>hog</b> <b>rings</b> should never be used when geonets are used adjacent to geomembranes. There are questions as to what influence overlapping has on the geonet's flow rate. The connection of geonets to perforated drainage pipes is difficult and extremely important. The geonet's outlet must be free draining at all times even in winter under freezing conditions.|$|R
40|$|Domesticated {{horses are}} often stabled and thus their natural grazing {{behavior}} is limited. Consequently, some animals develop stereotypic {{behaviors such as}} cribbing, an oral stereotypy linked to bowel obstruction, lower learning ability, dental wear, weight loss and general loss in value. The present study tested surgically-placed "crib rings" for their efficacy in cribbing control and effects on welfare. Six adult horses with a long-term history of cribbing were used. Small <b>hog</b> <b>rings</b> (copper covered steel, 1 - 5 / 32 " or 1 - 1 / 2 ") were placed into each horse's gums, between the upper incisors, under sedation with 0. 1 to 0. 2 mg/kg Detomidine. They were recorded 24 hours per day in the stall with a mounted camera and a time-lapse recorder and recorded grazing with a handheld video camera in five-minute intervals several times per week. Blood was drawn daily to test for plasma cortisol concentration. Horses were observed for several weeks before and after surgery. Average time spent cribbing and eating, average bites per minute grazing and average cortisol levels were calculated and compared using the student?s paired t-test with alpha-level 0. 05. Horses spent significantly less time cribbing (P= 0. 002) and more time eating (P= 0. 002) post-operation. They also took significantly fewer bites per minute grazing with the rings placed (P= 0. 004). Cortisol levels were significantly higher (p= 0. 001) on surgery day but dropped by day one; {{there was no significant}} increase post-surgically. Thus, overall crib rings appeared effective in decreasing cribbing behavior. Four of the six horses, however, returned to cribbing due to loss or bending of the rings, thus long term efficacy is questionable. Increased post-surgical eating may have been a replacement for cribbing. Longer eating time and less grazing may also indicate discomfort; however, cortisol results did not indicate chronic stress...|$|R
