[...] Knox later called the storyline an [...] "el-cheapo riff on 'Who Shot J.R?'". Television critic Andrew Mercado said [...] "we had [...] "Who Pushed PR" [...] which wasn't quite [...] "Who Shot JR" [...] on Dallas circa 1981 but it's amazing they got as much suspense as they did in an elevator and then shoving short Paul Robinson off a balcony just one floor off the ground". Mercado later praised the plot saying [...] "They did the 6000th episode really well" [...] and that the key to Neighbours staying relevant was to focus less on suburban storylines and more on that type of drama. Mary Papadakis from the Herald Sun called the plot [...] "sinister" [...] and commented [...] " [...] goes to show there's never really a dull day on Neighbours". A Channel 5 website writer deemed the plot [...] "one of the show's most dramatic storylines to date".
