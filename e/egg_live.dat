5000|$|The {{scientific}} {{culture of the}} 19th century introduced some [...] "scientific" [...] rationalizations for the myth's origins, by suggesting that {{the origin of the}} myth of the roc may lie in embellishments of the often-witnessed power of the eagle that could carry away a newborn lamb. In 1863, Bianconi suggested the roc was a raptor (Hawkins and Goodman, 2003: 1031). Recently a giant subfossil eagle, the Malagasy crowned eagle, identified from Madagascar was actually implicated as a top bird predator of the island, whose megafauna once included giant lemurs and pygmy hippopotamuses.Another possible origin of the myth is accounts of eggs of another extinct Malagasy bird, the enormous Aepyornis elephant bird, hunted to extinction by the 16th century, that was three meters tall and flightless. There were reported elephant bird sightings at least in folklore memory as Étienne de Flacourt wrote in 1658. Its <b>egg,</b> <b>live</b> or subfossilised, was known as early as 1420, when sailors to the Cape of Good Hope found eggs of the roc, according to a caption in the 1456 Fra Mauro map of the world, which says that the roc [...] "carries away an elephant or any other great animal".|$|E

5000|$|... (Jul. 14, 1999)Over hundred {{kilometres}} from Australia's north coast, the Yellow Waters and the South Alligator Rivers {{cut through}} an ancient limestone plateau to create Kakadu National Park. This {{is a rich}} natural world where nature has sculpted rainforest niches and deep gorges that fill with wild rivers with each monsoon. Here, the mighty saltwater crocodile reigns supreme. In the rivers, up the creeks and on the shores, the saltwater crocodile swims, hunts and lays <b>eggs.</b> <b>Living</b> alongside this giant prehistoric reptile are wallabies, pig-nosed turtles, king brown snakes, water lizards and hundreds of species of brightly coloured birds. For the Aborigines, the first humans to live here, there is no afterlife paradise is here and now in a Living Eden called Kakadu.|$|R
50|$|Occasionally females will {{split the}} clutch into two roughly equal-sized masses, {{both of which}} may be laid on the same night or over two nights. The average egg mass {{contains}} about 300 to 400 <b>eggs.</b> Females <b>live</b> for 6-8 days after eclosion, just like other related saturniids.|$|R
50|$|They are {{primarily}} ground-dwelling, hiding under thick leaf-litter. They are nocturnal, insectivorous and {{are thought to}} be oviparous.

40|$|EIGHTY {{patients}} (age range 4 - 10 years) with headlice infection {{were recruited}} to the study. Fortypatients {{were treated with}} a single application of 0. 2 % w/v phenothrin liquid shampoo and 40 with 0. 2 % w/v malathion lotion. Inspection of the patients one week later revealed that no live lice remained in either group, but that two patients had viable eggs in the malathion lotion group. Re-inspection four weeks after application revealed that five patients of the phenothrin shampoo group and seven of the malathion lotion group had viable <b>eggs.</b> <b>Live</b> lice were not seen {{to be present in}} either treatment group. The results indicate that both products are effective in the treatment of head lice infection and that the phenothrin shampoo would be a useful addition to the insecticides currently employed...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{species are}} {{simultaneous}} hermaphrodites, but some switch from male to female as they mature, while individuals of some species remain {{of the same}} sex all their lives. Individuals have one or two pairs of gonads, placed between the atrium and stomach, and opening into a single gonopore in the atrium. The eggs are thought to be fertilized in the ovaries. Most species release eggs that hatch into planktonic larvae, but a few brood their eggs in the gonopore. Those that brood small eggs nourish them by a placenta-like organ, while larvae of species with larger <b>eggs</b> <b>live</b> on stored yolk. The development of the fertilized egg into a larva follows a typical spiralian pattern: the cells divide by spiral cleavage, and mesoderm develops from a specific cell labelled [...] "4d" [...] in the early embryo. There is no coelom at any stage.|$|R

50|$|Sharing combs is {{a common}} cause of {{parasitic}} infections much like sharing a hat, as one user can leave a comb with <b>eggs</b> or <b>live</b> parasites, facilitating the transmission of lice, fleas, mites, fungi, and other undesirables. Siblings {{are also more likely}} to pass on nits to each other if they share a comb, so it is advisable to buy each child their own comb.|$|R

25|$|VHSV {{continues}} {{to be found in}} new geographical areas, in new species of fish. This is thought to represent both the spread of the virus into new areas, as with VHSV <b>egg</b> and <b>live</b> fish transfers from North America to Asia, or feeding of raw marine fish to inland farmed trout in Finland, as well as discovery of existing populations, as with an apparently well established marine reservoir in the Black Sea.|$|R
50|$|Tabanus nigrovittatus, {{also known}} as the greenhead horse fly, salt marsh greenhead, or simply the greenhead fly, greenhead or greenfly, is a species of biting horse-fly {{commonly}} found around coastal marshes of the Eastern United States. The biting females are a considerable pest to both humans and animals while they seek a source of blood protein to produce additional <b>eggs.</b> Females <b>live</b> for three to four weeks and may lay about 100 to 200 eggs per blood meal.|$|R
5000|$|In 1913, Barber {{published}} two papers about Micromalthus debilis, a small wood-boring beetle. He {{had discovered}} that there are several distinct types of larvae in this species and that under certain conditions larvae will produce both <b>eggs</b> and <b>live</b> larvae. This has since been confirmed by other scientists, but initially it was doubted by many entomologists. This was potentially his greatest single discovery, which occurred only fifteen years after he had his first exposure to entomological work.|$|R
5000|$|The queen {{maintains}} {{her power}} by killing cells that may contain potential queens. Only one queen may {{exist in a}} colony {{at a time and}} she lays <b>eggs</b> and <b>lives</b> together with her daughters. It {{is the responsibility of the}} daughters to take care of brood, protect the nest, and forage for food. [...] Other causes of colony decline are extraction of colonies for profit use, or from deforestation, thus destroying the homes of this species.|$|R
40|$|Twenty fungi were assayed {{in vitro}} for {{antagonism}} to eggs of Heterodera glycines. Eight of the fungi were isolated from cysts or eggs of H. glycines {{during the current}} study, one was isolated from Panagrellus redivivus, and eleven were obtained from other researchers or collections. The bioassays were conducted on eggs from nematodes that had been grown monoxenically on excised root tips. Phoma chrysanthemicola, one strain of Verticillium chlamydosporium, and one strain of V. lecanii caused a decrease (P < 0. 01, P < 0. 05, P < 0. 05, respectively) {{in the number of}} viable eggs, although no hyphae were observed colonizing <b>live</b> <b>eggs.</b> Trichoderma polysporum infected <b>live</b> <b>eggs</b> but enhanced (P < 0. 05) egg survival. Acremonium bacillisporum, Chaetomium sp., Drechmeria coniospora (two strains), Epicoccum sp., Exophiala jeanselmei, Fusarium sp., Neocosmospora vasinfecta, Scytalidium fulvum, Trichoderma harzianum (two strains), V. chlamydosporium (one strain), V. lecanii (three strains), and an unidentified fungus did not measurably affect egg viability, even though hyphae of five of these fungi were seen in <b>live</b> <b>eggs.</b> The bioassay provides a useful step in the selection of a biological control agent for this major nematode pest...|$|R
