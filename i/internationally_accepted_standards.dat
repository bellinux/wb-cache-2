The structured report is self-documenting: it includes a definition of its allowable data fields and values encoded as a reportspecific SGML document type definition (DTD). By linking its reporting concepts with those of external vocabularies such as the UMLS Metathesaurus, this system can create open, universally comprehensible structured reports. Keywords...|$|R

This paper gives a status report on the efforts made towards reaching an <b>internationally</b> <b>accepted</b> <b>standard</b> for interfaces which can be used for devices in clinical laboratories. The principal reasons that define the need for standardization are as follows. An analytical device delivered by supplier A generates data. These data are then processed by the laboratory data-processing system delivered by supplier B. This is schematically shown in figure 1...|$|R

It is hoped that WIPO, already experienced in the provision of aids to patent searching, might be willing to undertake the solution of this long standing problem. ...|$|R
