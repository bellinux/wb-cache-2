50|$|A {{herringbone}} gear, {{a specific}} type <b>of</b> <b>double</b> helical <b>gear,</b> is a special type <b>of</b> <b>gear</b> that is a side to side (not face to face) combination <b>of</b> two helical <b>gears</b> <b>of</b> opposite hands. From the top, each helical groove <b>of</b> this <b>gear</b> looks like the letter V, and many together form a herringbone pattern (resembling the bones of a fish such as a herring). Unlike helical gears, herringbone gears do not produce an additional axial load.|$|R
50|$|<b>Double</b> helical <b>gears</b> and {{herringbone}} gears are similar, but {{the difference}} is that herringbone gears do not have a groove in the middle like <b>double</b> helical <b>gears</b> do. <b>Double</b> helical <b>gears</b> overcome the problem of axial thrust presented by single helical gears by using two sets of teeth that are set in a V shape. A <b>double</b> helical <b>gear</b> {{can be thought of as}} two mirrored helical gears joined together. This arrangement cancels out the net axial thrust, since each half <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can remove the need for thrust bearings. However, <b>double</b> helical <b>gears</b> are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The two <b>gears</b> <b>of</b> the <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> is a mesh of a concave/convex combination. Because the {{curvature}} {{is close to}} each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size <b>of</b> the <b>gear</b> module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> set at a pressure angle of 24 °. Firstly, this paper would redefine a new <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> according to the discontinuousness tooth profile molded line of the <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> and unchangeable pressure angle and explain the improvements in the design and stress analysis of the tooth especially since the <b>double</b> circular-arc helical <b>gear</b> has no limitation in the minimum number of teeth. Thus, the decrease in the driving gears’ number of module and can further increase the reduction gear ratio. For heavily-loaded planetary gear reducer, it’s quite obvious in the miniaturizing and high torque superiority. This paper also used certain winch’s speed reducer as example to explain that the change of the pressure angle can reduce contact stress by 3 %~ 40 % and also enhances the torque ability by 3 %~ 40 %...|$|R

But study shows that the method current widely used only fits for the single side loaded <b>gear.</b> For <b>double</b> sides loaded <b>gear,</b> only a mean stress modification coefficient is concerned compared to single side loaded gear.

40|$|The {{hobbing machine}} {{of recent years}} has {{positively}} introduced a computer numerical control (CNC) system, but many traditional hobbing machines with gear trains are still being used to produce gears. These traditional machines generally prepare many indexing change gears for gear cutting. But when we cut the <b>gear</b> <b>of</b> a prime number of teeth, the indexing change gear is not prepared for more than about 100 teeth <b>of</b> the <b>gear.</b> In such a case, we have to correct the indexing {{of the number of}} teeth using a differential gear to cut a helical gear, but when we apply the prime number of teeth on the helical gear, we cannot choose an arbitrary feed speed.
