40|$|Background Tropical marine {{molluscs}} are traded globally. Larger species with slow life histories are under threat from over-exploitation. We {{report on the}} trade in protected marine mollusc shells in and from Java and Bali, Indonesia. Since 1987 twelve species of {{marine molluscs}} are protected under Indonesian law to shield them from overexploitation. Despite this pro-tection they are traded openly in large volumes. Methodology/Principal Findings We collected data on species composition, origins, volumes and prices at two large open markets (2013), collected data from <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> (2013), and compiled seizure data by the Indonesian authorities (2008 – 2013). All twelve protected species were observed in trade. Smaller species were traded for <USD 1. 00 whereas prices of larger species were USD 15. 00 – 40. 00 with clear price-size relationships. Some shells were collected locally in Java and Bali, but the trade involves networks stretching hundreds of kilometres throughout Indonesia. <b>Wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> offer protected marine mollusc shells for the export market b...|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{competition in}} the <b>wholesale</b> and retail <b>fish</b> marketing system in Kisumu, which is Kenya's largest fish market. It is based on cross sectional and time series primary data collected in a survey involving 88 retailers and 47 <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> of <b>fish</b> in the town. Stratified random sampling method was used in selecting the respondents, Concentration ratios, Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients are derived and evaluated for both markets. They demonstrate that market shares are unequally distributed among the wholesalers and retailers. The Gini coefficients are 0. 37 and 0. 45 for the whole and retail markets respectively. Based on a Gini coefficient cut-off level of 0. 4, it is concluded that the <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market exhibits effective competition while the retail outlet has oligopolistic tendencies. The implication of this level of competition to price efficiency is discussed. Intervention measures to enhance {{competition in the}} market are recommended...|$|R

In some contexts such as trade ongoing cooperation exists. We provide a micro-level analysis of economic interactions between Israeli and Palestinian <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> of fruits and vegetables. We use a unique dataset gathered by a quantitative survey among Israeli <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> {{in order to obtain}} evidence on their perspectives on this economic exchange. Trading patterns show vivid economic exchange of mainly informal character. Logistic regressions suggest that education and the personal social network play vital roles for the existence of Israeli-Palestinian trading relationships. Israeli traders feel not affected by the conflict but wish for its quick settlement. A low level of transaction problems is reported. They are mainly caused by the political and security situation and by the payment behavior of the Palestinian trading partners. Daily contacts of economic agents lead to continuous economic cooperation despite of ongoing {{political conflict}} and improve the perception of the actors of the other party...|$|R

The study surveyed 100 retailers and 30 <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> of charcoal. The information on their business was collected using a standardized questionnaire. The structure of marketing costs shows that transport and rental to civil servants are the main items in which significant efficiency gains could be achieved.

The Pu-Shin <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market, in Taiwan, is a case used to illustrate this procedure. We first established a simulation model for the operation of the Pu-Shin <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market, including all possible factors that may affect the auction time.

40|$|This study aims at {{identifying}} the existing institutional framework {{involved in the}} delivery of tsetse and trypanosomosis control inputs and services in Kenya with a view to determining (whether efficiency exists or not in the marketing system. The study also aims at {{identifying the}} appropriate institutional framework that enhances efficiency in the marketing system for delivery of these control inputs. The marketing structure is analysed by looking at the market share of the first four and first eight largest traders within the various channels of the tsetse and trypanosomosis control inputs marketing system. The results of analysis show that the wholesale marketing channel is the least -competitive,' followed by the pharmaceutical firms and the retail traders. According to the Bain (1968) industry classification model, there is evidence of a highly concentrated marketing system amongst the <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> while the pharmaceutical firms and the retail traders have a high to moderate market concentration. The marketing structure was therefore found to be inherently imperfectly competitive and was characterized by both monopolistic and oligopolistic features. The extent of market efficiency is then analysed by looking at the market performance indicators in this market viz a viz gross margins per trading level, variable costs, opportunity cost analysis and returns to capital investments per trading level. The results of analysis show that there is evidence of inefficiency in all the studied marketing firms. The least efficient marketing channel was that controlled by the retail traders, followed by the <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders.</b> The relatively inefficient marketing channel was that controlled by the pharmaceutical firms. The results of analysis show that the retail traders had the highest returns to capital while the pharmaceutical firms had the least returns to capital. IX Although the liberalisation regime was being put in place in the livestock health sector, it vas evident that the role of the government in dealing with the tsetse problem was not adequate ls observed by the diminishing budgetary allocations to the livestock heath sector and the •educed tsetse surveillance programs necessary to monitor the tsetse belts and spread of ‘fly’ in lew pasture lands. The research therefore indicated that imperfectness and non competitiveness was nherently visible in the tsetse and trypanosomosis control inputs and services marketing system jnd that there was urgent need for a policy intervention to remedy the situation. Some of the Droposed policy recommendations included: forming of livestock farmers co-operatives to purchase tsetse control inputs at a lower per unit cost due to economies of scale; encouraging more <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> to enter the wholesale channel in order to break the current cycle of their aligopolistic marketing structure; reducing information asymmetry in the market by bridging the information gap between livestock farmers and the marketing institutions. It is therefore concluded that further research has to be undertaken to ascertain the functioning of pharmaceutical firms especially in the area of pricing. This would give a clear indication of how these firms make their trading decisions and the resultant effect such an action would have in influencing the behaviour of the retail <b>traders,</b> the <b>wholesale</b> <b>traders</b> and the Animal Health Service Providers. More research is still needed in this area because currently, there is very little information database from which to draw inferences on the true situation in the present tsetse and trypanosomosis control inputs and services marketing system in Kenya...|$|R

Our objective is to characterize the behavior of market participants and, in particular, buyers in such a market structure. Our {{analysis of the data}} shows that buyer-seller relationships are less important than in a pairwise bargaining market such as the Marseille Fish market but that a significant amount of “loyalty" is still present under the auction mechanism. We provide an explanation of the “declining price paradox" for the fish market of Ancona by linking the rule used by the buyers to set their bid to the relationship between the variation in the price of the last transactions in the day and the quantity of fish available on that day. In fact, the average price tends to increase for last transactions on days characterized by limited supply of <b>fish.</b> <b>wholesale</b> <b>fish</b> market; Dutch auction...|$|R
