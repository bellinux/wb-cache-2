40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between language brokering and its effects on the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> stress of the brokers. Specifically, the relationships between language brokering, parentification, stress, and gender were explored. Gender differences in the strength of this relationship were also examined. The following was expected: <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification would correlate with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress; and that both brokering and parentification were gender specific, with female subjects reporting <b>higher</b> <b>levels.</b> The participants were 90 Latino undergrad students attending universities in the New York City area. The students completed several self-report measures including a parentification questionnaire, a language-brokering questionnaire, and stress scales. ^ Results showed that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> language brokering were positively correlated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification. Although no gender differences were found for <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> language brokering, females reported <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification. Those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> brokering did not report <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress. However, those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> parentification reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> stress. The {{results of the present study}} emphasized the need for understanding the ramifications and long-term consequences of language brokering, particularly for the Latino community. While brokering itself may not lead to a heightened degree of stress, cultural nuances within the Latino community serve to further perpetuate the pressures associated with brokering. As such, once a pattern of brokering has been established and identified, interventions must be developed to decrease the occurrence of long term impairment of individual and family functioning. ...|$|R

Among participants of a preventive medical checkup at an Austrian District Health Insurance Fund (n= 904, response rate = 82. 2 %, 42 % women, 18 - 91 years) self-reported and measured data were collected.

Moreover, we hypothesized that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion would lead to lower <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> professional efficacy and that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy would lead to low <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion. Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> exhaustion; <b>high</b> control was longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> efficacy.

40|$|There are {{tradeoffs}} to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> approach motivation. On the one hand, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> approach motivation {{are thought}} to underlie positive emotional states such as excitement (Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, & Tellegen, 1999). <b>High</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> approach motivation should also invigorate goal pursuit (Higgins, 1997) and potentially facilitate progress as a result (Carver & Scheier, 1998). On the other hand, Gray (1982) suggested that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> approach motivation predispose one to a certain class of dysregulated outcomes. Increasingly so, and consistent with the latter perspective, <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> approach motivation {{have been linked to}} addictive behaviors (Franken, Muris, & Georgieva, 2006), anger and aggression (Carver & Harmon-Jones, 2009), and bipolar symptoms (Alloy et al., 2006). Nonetheless, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-reported approach moti-vation, considered alone, may often not predict its problem-atic manifestations. For example, <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> self-control should mitigate the extent to which approach motivation results in addiction (Baumeister, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994).
