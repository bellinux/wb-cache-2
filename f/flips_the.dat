5|$|The Critters rule is a block {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function <b>flips</b> <b>the</b> state of every cell in a block that does not have exactly two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with exactly three live cells. Because this function is invertible, the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible {{cellular automaton}}.|$|E
5|$|As Michael {{travels to}} Haddonfield, Laurie begins having {{hallucinations}} that mirror Michael's and also begin to include her acting out his murders. Meanwhile, Loomis goes on tour {{to promote his}} new book, only to be criticized by the public, who blame him for Michael's actions and for exploiting the deaths of Michael's victims. When Loomis' book is released, Laurie discovers that she is really Angel Myers, Michael's long-lost sister. She goes to a party with Mya (Brea Grant) and Harley (Angela Trimbur) to escape how she is feeling. Michael appears and kills Harley, then goes to the Brackett house and fatally wounds Annie Brackett (Danielle Harris). When Laurie and Mya arrive, Michael kills Mya and then comes after Laurie, who manages to escape. Laurie flags down a car, but Michael kills the driver and <b>flips</b> <b>the</b> car over with Laurie still inside. Michael then takes the unconscious Laurie to an abandoned shed.|$|E
25|$|The {{individual}} {{engages in}} the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, {{when a child is}} told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a series of math problems, to which the student <b>flips</b> <b>the</b> desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principals office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing math problems. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, novel tasks, etc.|$|E

500|$|Some critics {{compared}} the storyline {{to the five}} stages of grief, a theory introduced by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross. Alex Panisch of Out opined that the first five tracks [...] "document the five stages of a relationship turning sour: good times, doubt, breaking up, coping, and still being hung up". Critics also noted that, unlike other artists' break up records, the singer admits in Truth Serum {{that she was the}} person who made a mistake that ended the relationship. Panisch commented that; [...] "When female artists sing about breakups [...] they almost overwhelmingly write themselves in the position of the wronged party and their songs are about recovering and strengthening from the experience. [...] Tove Lo <b>flips</b> <b>the</b> script on this narrative". Shanon Carlin of Radio.com stated that the singer [...] "doesn't try and capitalize off her heartbreak by writing a female empowerment anthem that shames the guy who did her wrong. No, on this album, Lo is not an innocent. It's actually quite the opposite".|$|E

Two-Face declares that they will kill Batman if the coin lands scratched side up, but let him go if the unscarred side appears. Two-Face <b>flips</b> <b>the</b> coin and declares Batman free.

2500|$|A toggle {{light switch}} is a switch, most {{commonly}} used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers.

2500|$|Suppose a {{researcher}} flips a coin {{five times in}} a row and assumes a null hypothesis that the coin is fair. The test statistic of [...] "total number of heads" [...] can be one-tailed or two-tailed: a one-tailed test corresponds to seeing if the coin is biased towards heads, but a two-tailed test corresponds to seeing if the coin is biased either way. The researcher <b>flips</b> <b>the</b> coin five times and observes heads each time (HHHHH), yielding a test statistic of 5. In a one-tailed test, this is the upper extreme of all possible outcomes, and yields a p-value of (1/2)5 = 1/32 ≈ 0.03. If the researcher assumed a significance level of 0.05, this result would be deemed significant and the hypothesis that the coin is fair would be rejected. In a two-tailed test, a test statistic of zero heads (TTTTT) is just as extreme and thus the data of HHHHH would yield a p-value of 2×(1/2)5 = 1/16 ≈ 0.06, which is not significant at the 0.05 level.|$|E

[...] Jay Ellis, however, disagrees. [...] " [...] missed the extremely quiet but audible fade in a few tones from a keyboard beginning when Chigurh <b>flips</b> <b>the</b> coin for the gas station man", he said. [...] "This ambient music (by long-time Coens collaborator Carter Burwell) grows imperceptibly in volume so that it is easily missed as an element of the mis-en-scene. But it is there, telling our unconscious that something different is occurring with the toss; this becomes certain when it ends as Chigurh uncovers the coin on the counter. The deepest danger has passed as soon as Chigurh finds (and Javier Bardem's acting confirms this) and reveals to the man that he has won."
