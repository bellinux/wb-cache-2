The study of the third harmonics of the ac susceptibility has shown that the ac frequency {{plays an important role in}} the electromagnetic coupling of the grains in the granular sample. In particular, the characteristic harmonic response of the bulk sample at the highest frequency resembles the response of the unconnected grains of the powders, even at low frequencies. Moreover, the possibility of the occurrence of magnetic field focusing in the region between the grains, ascribed to both superconducting shielding and geometric effect of the grains, has been considered to explain the observed peak effect in the dc magnetization loops on the bulk sample. Although our investigation has be confined to the LaFeAsO 0. 92 F 0. 08 granular, these results may be applied to any granular sample consisting of <b>flat</b> <b>grains</b> connected by weak links.

This process has several functions on the final shaped glass including removing sharp edges, improving mechanical resistance, decreasing surface damage and giving it an aesthetical aspect. This article addresses the effects of working parameters, including grinding forces and consumed power, on surface edge finishing and damage mechanism induced during glass grinding. Microscopic observations and multi-scale analysis have also been conducted to investigate the surface edge characteristics. Experimental results show three damage regimes. The first (regime I) is a partial ductile regime with cutting action accompanied by chip formation. The second (regime II) is a crushing (or fragmentation) regime. The last (regime III) is also a partial ductile regime but by ploughing action with displaced material. The shaped surface obtained in the regime II has a better roughness than that obtained in regime I and III. However, regimes I and III include streaks and form defects which are not present in regime II. Similar to metallic materials, the evolution of force components show a linear relationship between normal and tangential forces.

40|$|The {{surface stress}} induced during the {{formation}} of alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold from the vapor phase was measured using a micromechanical cantilever-based chemical sensor. Simultaneous in situ thickness measurements were carried out using ellipsometry. Ex situ scanning tunneling microscopy was performed in air to ascertain the final monolayer structure. The evolution of the surface stress induced during coverage-dependent structural phase transitions reveals features not apparent in average ellipsometric thickness measurements. These results show that both the kinetics of SAM formation and the resulting SAM structure are strongly influenced both by the surface structure of the underlying gold substrate and by the impingement rate of the alkanethiol onto the gold surface. In particular, the adsorption onto gold surfaces having large, <b>flat</b> <b>grains</b> produces high-quality self-assembled monolayers. An induced compressive surface stress of 15. 9 ± 0. 6 N/m results when a c(4 × 2) dodecanethiol SAM forms on gold. However, the SAMs formed on small-grained gold are incomplete and an induced surface stress of only 0. 51 ± 0. 02 N/m results.

40|$|In {{surfaces}} with grainy features, {{the local}} roughness w shows a crossover at a characteristic length r_c, with roughness exponent changing from α_ 1 ≈ 1 {{to a smaller}} α_ 2. The grain shape, the choice of w or height-height correlation function (HHCF) C, and the procedure to calculate root mean-square averages are shown to have remarkable effects on α_ 1. With grains of pyramidal shape, α_ 1 can be as low as 0. 71, which is {{much lower than the}} previous prediction 0. 85 for rounded grains. The same crossover is observed in the HHCF, but with initial exponent χ_ 1 ≈ 0. 5 for <b>flat</b> <b>grains,</b> while for some conical grains it may increase to χ_ 1 ≈ 0. 7. The universality class of the growth process determines the exponents α_ 2 =χ_ 2 after the crossover, but has no effect on the initial exponents α_ 1 and χ_ 1, supporting the geometric interpretation of their values. For all grain shapes and different definitions of surface roughness or HHCF, we still observe that the crossover length r_c is an accurate estimate of the grain size.

The inﬂuence of the A-site composition (Na and/or Bi excess) on both the structural/microstructural characteristics and the electrical properties is discussed. Whatever {{the composition of the}} NBT target, the ﬁnal layers are systematically epitaxially grown, with NBT crystallites mainly (110) -oriented, and as well (100) -oriented for some minor proportion. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images reveal the coexistence of two kinds of grains presenting different shapes: namely <b>ﬂat</b> and elongated <b>grains,</b> corresponding to (100) - and (110) -oriented NBT crystallites, respectively. The macroscopic ferroelectric properties were measured at room temperature. A rather well-deﬁned shape of the hysteresis loops was obtained: the incorporation of a Bi excess in the target clearly improves the saturation of the loops. The ferroelectric performances are a remanent polarization (Pr) value, ranging from 7 to 14 lC/cm 2, associated with a coercive ﬁeld (Ec) in the range 68 - 85 kV/cm. In addition, at 10 5 Hz, the relative permittivity was about er 255 - 410 and the dielectric losses (tan d) were 6 %- 7 %. Finally, the electrical properties at the local scale were investigated by coupling piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and tunneling AFM (TUNA) measurements. The collected data reveal that the two types of grains behave differently. The PFM amplitude signal of (110) -oriented grains is very contrasted and such grains are often divided in ferroelectric bi-domains of nanometric sizes, whereas the response of (100) -oriented grains is less contrasted and more homogeneous. The interpretation of the PFM signal is provided. The piezoloop recorded on a (110) NBT grain is strongly distorted and shifted along the vertical axis, in agreement with the vertical drift observed for macroscopic ferroelectric data.

30|$|Volume of material, {{anisotropic}} growth features, flatness of {{the grains}} resulted, size, shape and separation of grains and finally different extent of oxidation; {{these are the}} factors basically responsible for different magnetic behaviors shown by the nickel thin films nanostructured by different techniques. For example, for trench template technique, {{it is expected that}} due to shadowing effects, limited material would get access inside the trench template when compared to that for the regular random growth features outside the trench. The extents of oxidation for usual thin film growth outside the trench and inside the trench are expected to be same, since not much different conditions of oxygen availability is speculated. Anisotropic growth features in trench template grown nanowires however are held primarily responsible for different kinds of magnetic behavior. Electric field-induced and excimer laser-induced techniques however are expected to effectively evaporate (etch out) the material, and hence material volume reduction is speculated. Among these two techniques, excimer laser technique has yielded almost isotropic kind of grain growth features, while on the other hand electric field-induced technique has yielded anisotropic grain growth features. Isotropic <b>flat</b> <b>grains</b> in excimer laser case have not been saturated at small field. In electric field case however, grains are relatively higher (large height/diameter ratio) and not in contact with each other and apart from all this grains are organized in electric field direction too.

Based on these works, we successfully made a dense supported LSGM thin film with a thickness of 20 - 50 mum using a costly effective wet chemical-physics method. Anode substrate with 60 % NiO possesses preferable sintering-shrinkage rate, porosity and pore radii distribution. Its specific pore surface area and specific pore volume are also larger. Electrical conductivity of reduced anode substrates increases with NiO content in the substrates. Electrical conductivity of reduced anode substrates with low NiO content increases rapidly with ac impedance measuring time and changes from electronic conduction to ionic conduction.
