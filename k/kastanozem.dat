This {{is of interest}} to archaeologists as after disturbances, both short- and long-term, pedogenesis (re-) starts obliterating previous signs. Soil modifications induced by human activity {{may be linked to}} pedogenetic evidence for disturbance with archaeological evidence for the cultural activities. We contrasted two 750 -m 3 soil pedons, an Anthrosol and a <b>Kastanozem,</b> from which the Anthrosol is derived, using 77 descriptors of soil properties which have been utilized in archaeological studies (pedo-morphological, routine laboratory, biochemical, metals and rare earth elements plus yttrium, REY) with the aim of identifying a group of descriptors able to sort the occurrence of human interventions. But, which one is more promising? Our findings indicate that by the use of rare earth spatial patterns it is possible to classify the occurrence of human interventions, in the case of emplacement of new parent material in respect to bulk soil disturbance in situ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{phosphorus}} fixation and impinging factors on wheat cultivated fields around the Lake Van region. Main soil groups were taken into account according to their folding areas representing the province, namely Calcisol Cambisol, <b>Kastanozem,</b> Fluvisol and Regosol, in two levels of depth, 0 - 20 cm and 20 - 40 cm. A total of 52 soil samples were taken from different areas. Phosphorus fixation capacity was calculated by adding three level of phosphorus, 25 ppm, 50 ppm, 150 ppm; half an hour, twenty-four hours and seventy two hours. Phosphorus fixations were found to be 51. 2 % in Calcisols, 45. 2 % in Cambisols, 50. 8 % in Kastanozems, 47. 8 % in Fluvisols and 45. 1 % in Regosol groups. It was also recorded that the big proportion of phosphorus fixations at all soil group occurred in half an hour`s time. There were significant correlations between characteristics of soil groups and phosphorus fixation. These correlations with phosphorus fixation, within Calcisol soils, CEC and organic matter, within Cambisols, clay, silt, sand, organic matter and CEC, within Fluvisols, clay, sand, CaCO 3 and pH, within regosols, clay and CaCO 3 and pH were detected positively.

Nevertheless, little is known about organic matter (OM) dynamics in these soils, though OM is crucial for soil fertility and represents an important carbon sink. We aimed at investigating OM dynamics along a salinity and sodicity gradient in the soils of the southwestern Siberian Kulunda steppe (<b>Kastanozem,</b> non-sodic Solonchak, Sodic Solonchak) by assessing the organic carbon (OC) stocks, {{the quantity and quality of}} particulate and mineral-associated OM in terms of non-cellulosic neutral sugar contents and carbon isotopes (δ 13 C, 14 C activity), and the microbial community composition based on phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) patterns. Aboveground biomass was measured as a proxy for plant growth and soil OC inputs. Our hypotheses were that (i)  soil OC stocks decrease along the salinity gradient, (ii)  the proportion and stability of particulate OM is larger in salt-affected Solonchaks compared to non-salt-affected Kastanozems, (iii)  sodicity reduces the proportion and stability of mineral-associated OM, and (iv)  the fungi : bacteria ratio is negatively correlated with salinity. Against our first hypothesis, OC stocks increased along the salinity gradient with the most pronounced differences between topsoils. In contrast to our second hypothesis, the proportion of particulate OM was unaffected by salinity, thereby accounting for only [*]<[*]  10...|$|E

40|$|In the Otjiwarongo region (Northern Namibia), Vertisol- Kastanozem-Calcisol soil {{associations}} {{occur as}} patches {{of several hundred}} hectares in extent. They have formed in fine- grained Mid-Holocene sediments which accumulated {{on both sides of}} the subcontinental watershed between the Ugab River draining into the South Atlantic and the Omatako Omuramba draining into the Kalahari Basin. <b>Kastanozem</b> formation cannot be explained by the environments that exist at present. The humification suggests open savanna environments in the past and does not accord with the shrublands and thornbush savanna at present. Using AMS C- 14 and OSL data, it is possible to distinguish two periods of soil degradation during the recent past. Initially, most of the Kastanozems and Vertisols were buried by slope wash sediments to a depth of several decimetres. This process started in the mid- 19 th century at the latest. In a second phase, the soils were affected by rill and gully erosion, indicating increased runoff. This occurred during the last decades of the 19 th and the first decades of the 20 th century, probably as a result of intensified cattle farming. In contrast to other parts of Namibia, the prominent river channels of the Otjiwarongo region, most of them up to 20 in wide and 3 - 4 in deep, are a result of recent erosion. Degradation of vegetation and soils, and river channel formation, seem to be the main causes of farmland aridification. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

The soils are slightly alkaline, with a moderate carbonates content, low up to average humus and total nitrogen ones, and diverse, from very low to very high, of mobile phosphorus and potassium. Some {{of them have a}} salinization level up to 688 mg soluble salts per 100 g soil. The mobile and totalselenium contents are high, superior to the average general content of the World’s soils and to the contents of the South-Eastern Romanian Plain and Central and South Dobrogea soils. In fact, they are the highest values registered so far in Romania’s soils. In general, the soils within the built-up area have higher values than those of the outside built-over one both for selenium and other chemical elements. Direct proportionality relations were established between the total selenium content and some of the agrochemical soil properties (indirect with the pH), all of them statistically ensured, and also between the total and mobile selenium contents, on one hand, and the micro elements (heavy metals) contents on the other hand. Theensuring degree of the selenium’s correlations with some heavy metals increases by depth which shows the geogenic origin of the chemical elements in the Delta soils.

Maize and beans occupy > 80 % of the arable land in low-input, low-yielding subsistence farming. Three collaborative field trials were conducted in different agroecological zones to evaluate the effects of water-conservation techniques (mulching of crop residue, a soil surfactant and pigeon-pea hedges) combined with organic amendments (compost and animal or green manure) on runoff and soil loss. During the 2011 and 2012 rainy seasons, three treatments and one control (traditional practice) were applied to 44 - and 24 -m 2 field plots. A local maize variety and two types of beans were planted. Runoff and suspended sediments were collected and quantified after each daily erosive rainfall. Runoff occurred for rainfalls ≥ 50 mm (slope 10 % and {{in the treatment of}} surfactant with organic amendment on the slope < 10 %. Soil loss reached 16. 6, 5. 1, 6. 6 and 0. 4 Mg ha− 1 on the Regosol (≤ 23 % slope) for the control, surfactant, pigeon-pea and mulch/pigeon-pea (with organic amendment) treatments, respectively; 3. 2, 0. 9, 1. 3 and 0. 1 Mg ha− 1 on the Cambisol (≤ 37 % slope) and < 0. 2 Mg ha− 1 for all treatments and control on the <b>Kastanozem</b> (< 10 % slope). Erosion was highly positively correlated with runoff. Mulch with pigeon-pea combined with an organic amendment significantly reduced runoff and erosion from agricultural fields on steep slopes, contributing to improved use of rainwater at the plot level. Sustainable land management techniques, such as mulching with pigeon-pea hedges and an organic amendment, should be advocated and promoted for the semiarid hillsides of Cabo Verde prone to erosion to increase rainwater-use and to prevent further soil degradation...|$|E

40|$|Due to anthropic pressure, {{many areas}} of the world are {{affected}} by a process of soil “entisolization” that leads to the formation of “anthropogenic soils”. In order to investigate Man's role in soil evolution, a survey was carried out in Southeastern Sicily (Italy), where, for years, there have been wide farming areas with anthropogenic soils. A chronosequence of anthropogenic soils in a vineyard area, cultivated for 22 years, was investigated. The first stage of the chronosequence was made by the original soils which, in the study area, had been undisturbed till the 1980 's. These soils, classified as Entic Haploxerolls under the American Soil Taxonomy (ST) or Calcaric <b>Kastanozem</b> according to the World Reference Base (WRB) system, were used for almond groves and/or grazing and showed an A–C or A–Bw–C profile. In 1982 these soils were subjected to trenching in order to establish a vineyard and resulted in a complete mixing of the original soil horizons and the formation of soils classifiable as Haplic Xerarents (ST) or Aric Regosols (WRB). After 20 years, in 2002, the vineyard was removed and the surface of the Entisol/ Regosol was covered by a 50 ÷ 70 cm thick layer of transported parent material, composed of soft “marly limestone”. In July 2004 these soils were mixed once again by deep ploughing (∼ 100 cm deep) to establish a new vineyard. These deeply disturbed soils, were surveyed again and tentatively classified. These newly created soils show a double sequence of artificial horizons at an oblique angle to the soil surface. Their complex genesis pattern does not allow their classification as Arents (ST) or Regosols (WRB), so a tentative classification is proposed following both the ST and the WRB rules, as Miscic Geofragmexerants and Geomiscic Anthrosols, respectively. © 2007 Elsevier B.

The effects of the remediation in comparison to nonremediated soils on microbial diversity and activity were analyzed with the single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and microbial respiratory activity. All topsoils were characterized by neutral to weakly alkaline pH values, high contents of Corg, and clay. The total contents ranged between 0. 46 and 5. 89 mg kg− 1 for Cd, between 1. 19 and 81. 4 mg kg− 1 for Cu, and between 210 and 976 mg kg− 1 for Zn.

Concentrations of natural radionuclides were determined in soils from a small catchment in the middle mountain environment of the Central Spanish Pyrenees. Radioisotope activities were well within the natural ranges for soil, averaging 27, 26, 32 and 500 Bq kg- 1 for 238 U, 226 Ra, 208 Tl and 40 K, respectively. Their distributions in the soil profile were analysed along three transects of contrasting physiography and soil type. Uranium was depleted in upper layers of the soil and slightly enriched in deeper sections, while 226 Ra, 40 K and 208 Tl were more uniformly distributed. Radionuclide activities in the Calcaric Regosols on the shrub slope were less than those in the deeper and better developed Haplic <b>Kastanozems</b> under forest and in Calcaric Fluvisols in the valley bottom. These spatial patterns seem to be affected by the soil type; other landscape features, such as slope orientation and vegetation cover, appeared to have an indirect effect. The results indicate that the depth distribution of the radionuclides is affected by some soil properties, including pH, carbonates, organic matter and particle size, and soil processes, such as leaching and adsorption.
