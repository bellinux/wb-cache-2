The Eden Initiative, of which this mission is the major part, is a project aimed at saving Earth from this Armageddon. The key to this is the rare mineral iridium oxide, found on the harsh alien planet AJ3905. AJ3905 is a world accessible only through an interplanetary device called the Quantum Gate and the mission involves a series of mining expeditions to extract the mineral and bring it back to Earth. However, AJ3905's hellish atmosphere consists of a poisonous, caustic gas that promises an agonising death for unprotected humans which requires the wearing of a protective suit (known as a 'Tophat'). Furthermore, it is occupied by a hostile life form that appear as frighteningly skeletal anthropomorphic forms through the Tophat's virtual reality display. It is the role of Griffin and his fellow army recruits to protect the scientific mining crew during their repeated forays to the planet.|$|E

To provide a technical basis to permit the waste treatment facility, a relatively organic-rich Hanford Tank 241 -AN- 107 waste simulant was spiked with 14 target volatile, semi-volatile and pesticide compounds, and evaporated under vacuum in a bench-scale natural circulation evaporator fitted with an industrial stack off-gas sampler at the Savannah River Technology Center.

Several technologies (Bulk Vitrification and Steam Reforming) are currently being evaluated for immobilizing the pretreated waste. Since the WTP does not have sufficient capacity to pretreat all the waste going to supplemental treatment by the 2028 milestone, two technologies (Selective Dissolution and Fractional Crystallization) are being considered for pretreatment of salt waste. The scope of this task was to: (1) evaluate the recent Savannah River Site (SRS) Tank 41 dissolution campaign and other literature to provide a more complete understanding of selective dissolution, (2) provide an update on the progress of salt dissolution and modeling activities at SRS, (3) investigate SRS experience and outside literature sources on industrial equipment and experimental results of previous fractional crystallization processes, and (4) evaluate recent Hanford AP 104 boildown experiments and modeling results and recommend enhancements to the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Simulation</b> <b>Program</b> (ESP) to improve its predictive capabilities.

A computer model describing the semi-batch evaporation of cesium eluate solutions was built using the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Simulation</b> <b>Program</b> (ESP), licensed by OLI Systems, Inc., and was run to calculate the physical properties of each test matrix solution concentrated to the target endpoints of 80 percent and 100 percent bulk saturation.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this task {{given in the}} test specification were to expand the waste feed evaporator OLI model by including all the major components of the evaporator off-gas treatment system. Also {{as part of this}} task, two test cases were developed that defined the baseline untreated waste feed composition, target organic components to be tracked, and the waste-to-recycle blend ratio. The goal of this task was to develop air emissions projections for two test cases using the expanded waste feed evaporator OLI model. The organic partitioning predictions and air emission projections are ultimately to be validated against experimental data obtained during pilot evaporator tests.

The Office of River Protection Hanford Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant consists of three primary facilities: a Pretreatment Facility and two facilities for low-activity and high-level waste vitrification. The Pretreatment Facility contains unit operations which receive waste feed from the Hanford Tank Farms and separate it into two treated waste streams: a low-activity, liquid waste stream stripped of most solids and radioisotopes (processed through the Low-Activity Waste Vitrification Facility) and a high-level waste slurry containing most of the solids and radioisotopes (processed through the High-Level Waste Vitrification Facility).

ESP, which is produced by OLI Systems, Inc., utilizes sophisticated activity coefficient models and predictive equations that result {{in the ability to}} simulate very complex electrolyte systems (OLI, 2002). The software comes with databanks of regressed parameters for a large number of aqueous, vapor, and solid species covering most of the elements. ESP has been used extensively at the U. S. Department of Energy Hanford Site to predict nuclear waste slurry vapor-liquid-solid equilibrium. It has and is being used to model leaching and washing of nuclear waste sludges, evaporation of nuclear waste solutions, crystallization of salts, precipitation of plutonium and other metals from waste solutions, and other processing of dilute and concentrated aqueous solutions, sludges, and slurries. The software is also used extensively to rationalize the characterization of nuclear wastes using limited data from analyses of waste samples. The OLI provided databanks suffer from a legacy interaction model that limits the accuracy when neutral solutes are important. Also, the nitrate â€“ nitrite systems typically found in nuclear wastes are not properly parameterized in ESP databases because of the existence of sodium nitrate and nitrite ion pairs. Properties databanks for ESP have been developed at Flour Federal Services that eliminate the legacy model and provide more accurate simulation results than the OLI supplied databases for such concentrated solutions and slurries...|$|E

This work {{was funded by the}} Tanks Focus Area (EM- 50) under Technical Task Plan Number RL 0 - 8 -WT- 41, ''PHMC Pretreatment [...] Saltcake Dissolution''. The tests performed on saltcake from tank TX- 113 were similar in scope to those completed in previous years on waste from tanks BY- 102, BY- 106, B- 106, A- 101, and S- 102 (Herting 1998, 1999). In addition to the ''standard'' dissolution tests, new types of tests were performed this year related to feed stability and radionuclide distribution. The River Protection Project (RPP) is tasked with retrieving waste from double-shell and single-shell tanks to provide feed for vitrification. The RPP organization needs chemical and physical data to evaluate technologies for retrieving the waste. Little significant laboratory testing has been done to evaluate in-tank dissolution parameters for the various types of saltcake wastes that exist in single-shell tanks. A computer modeling program known as the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Simulation</b> <b>Program</b> (ESP), produced by OLI Systems, Inc of Morris Plains, New Jersey, is being used by the RPP organization to predict solubilities during dilution and retrieval of all tank waste types.

40|$|During the FY 1998 Saltcake Dissolution Workshop, {{participants}} identified nine {{tasks to}} be performed prior to the FY 1999 workshop. Discussions during the workshop indicated that significant progress was made in each area. The workshop focused on {{the strengths and weaknesses}} of the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Simulation</b> <b>Program</b> (ESP). In addition, the ESP predictions for the Tank SY- 101 remediation and the ESP validation efforts were evaluated. Finally, the need for a broader user base was identified. At the request of the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS), the ESP model was successfully utilized to predict the effects of Hanford tank farm operations such as waste transfers and water dilutions. The ESP model was originally developed to predict the compositions of solutions from off gas scrubbers. Therefore, the original database for the ESP model was designed for use with solutions with low ionic strengths. However, the Hanford tanks contain waste with very high ionic strengths. TWRS and Tank Focus Area (TFA) staff members have measured the solubilities of key components at high ionic strengths. The results from these studies were used to develop the Hanford database for the ESP model so the model could more accurately predict the compositions of Hanford waste streams with high ionic streams. The OLI Corporation, which developed the ESP model, has now incorporated most of the Hanford database into its standard ESP database. Another deficiency of the ESP model involves the lack of detailed documentation. Most new users of the ESP model normally encounter several obstacles. Therefore, TWRS management has proposed the development of an ESP user guide based on the experiences of TWRS and TFA researchers. The objective of the user guide is to make the ESP model more user friendly for the Hanford process engineers. The saltcake dissolution experiments at Hanford and the SOLGAS calculations at Oak Ridge are critically in the validation of the ESP model. Due to the high costs associated with the experiments with actual waste, the TWRS would prefer to use the ESP model to predict the effects of most tank farm operations. A comparison of the SOLGAS and ESP calculations indicated that the models were not in good agreement at most of the hydroxide concentration. The SOLGAS model uses the Gibbs free energy of formation to determine the solubilities of the chemical constituents while the ESP uses the KFIT subroutine. The agreement between the ESP and SOLGAS predictions improved when the ESP calculations were based on thermodynamic functions. TPA researchers will contact OLI Corporation to determine the experimental results needed to improve the fit. In addition, a high ionic strength model, which was developed by Moonis Ally of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, will be used to validate the ESP model. One of the new points of emphasis involves the need for the TPA researchers to work with a wider range of users at the Hanford site. Most of the previous TFA and users interactions involved the engineering group, which is responsible for the initial remediation of Tank SY- 101. A list of other potential users in the areas of process engineering, tank farm operations, and retrieval was developed. Meetings between the TFA researchers and these potential customers will be held over the next several months...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to limited}} tank space at Hanford and Savannah River, the liquid nuclear wastes or supernatants have been {{concentrated}} in evaporators to remove excess water {{prior to the}} hot solutions being transferred to underground storage tanks. As the waste solutions cooled, the salts in the waste exceeded the associated solubility limits and precipitated {{in the form of}} saltcakes. The initial step in the remediation of these saltcakes is a rehydration process called saltcake dissolution. At Hanford, dissolution experiments have been conducted on small saltcake samples from five tanks. Modeling of these experimental results, using the <b>Environmental</b> <b>Simulation</b> <b>Program</b> (ESP), are being performed at the Diagnostic Instrumentation and Analysis Laboratory (DIAL) at Mississippi State University. The River Protection Project (RPP) at Hanford will use these experimental and theoretical results to determine the amount of water that will be needed for its dissolution and retrieval operations. A comprehensive effort by the RPP and the Tank Focus Area continues to validate and improve the ESP and its databases for this application. The initial effort focused on the sodium, fluoride, and phosphate system due to its role in the formation of pipeline plugs. In FY 1999, an evaluation of the ESP predictions for sodium fluoride, trisodium phosphate dodecahydrate, and natrophosphate clearly indicated that improvements to the Public database of the ESP were needed. One of the improvements identified was double salts. The inability of any equilibrium thermodynamic model to properly account for double salts in the system can result in errors in the predicted solid-liquid equilibria (SLE) of species in the system. The ESP code is evaluated by comparison with experimental data where possible. However, data does not cover the range of component concentrations and temperatures found in many tank wastes. Therefore, comparison of ESP with another code is desirable, and may illuminate problems with both. For this purpose, the SOLGASMIX code was used in conjunction with a small private database developed at ORNL. This code calculates thermodynamic equilibria through minimization of Gibbs Energy, and utilizes the Pitzer model for activity coefficients. The sodium nitrate-sulfate double salt and the sodium fluoride-sulfate double salt were selected for the FY 2000 validation study of ESP. Even though ESP does not include the sulfate-nitrate double salt, this study found that this omission {{does not appear to be}} a major consequence. In this case, the solubility predictions with and without the sulfate-nitrate double salt are comparable. In contrast, even though the sulfate-fluoride double salt is included within the ESP databank, comparison to previous experimental results indicates that ESP underestimates solubility. Thus, the prediction for the sulfate-fluoride system needs to be improved. A main consequence of the inability to accurately predict the SLE of double salts is its impact on the predicted ionic strength of the solution. The ionic strength has been observed to be an important factor in the formation of pipeline plugs. To improve the ESP prediction, solubility tests on the sulfate-fluoride system are underway at DIAL, and these experimental results will be incorporated into the Public database by OLI System, Inc. Preliminary ESP simulations also indicated difficulties with the SLE prediction for anhydrous sodium sulfate. The Public database for the ESP does not include fundamental parameters for this solid in mixed solutions below 32. 4 C. The limitation, in the range of anhydrous sodium sulfate, leads to convergence problems in ESP and to inaccurate predictions of solubility near the invariant point when sodium sulfate decahydrate and other salts, such as sodium nitrate, were present. These difficulties were partially corrected through the use of an additional database. In conclusion, these results indicate the need for experimental data at temperatures above 25 C and in solutions containing both nitrate and hydroxide. Furthermore, the validation and documentation of different ESP input data sets is still a crucial need. With judicious use, ESP can still provide valuable guidance for water processing operations. However, this study has identified several improvements and corrections, which could be implemented immediately...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{samples of}} heel solids from tank 241 -C- 109 were {{delivered}} to the 222 -S Laboratory for characterization and dissolution testing. After being drained thoroughly, one-half to two-thirds of the solids were off-white to tan solids that, visually, were fairly evenly graded in size from coarse silt (30 - 60 &# 956;m) to medium pebbles (8 - 16 mm). The remaining solids were mostly strongly cemented aggregates ranging from coarse pebbles (16 - 32 mm) to fine cobbles (6 - 15 cm) in size. Solid phase characterization and chemical analysis indicated that the air-dry heel solids contained &# 8776; 58 wt% gibbsite [Al(OH) {sub 3 }] and &# 8776; 37 wt% natrophosphate [Na{sub 7 }F(PO{sub 4 }) {sub 2 }ï¿½ 19 H{sub 2 }O]. The strongly cemented aggregates were mostly fine-grained gibbsite cemented with additional gibbsite. Dissolution testing was performed on two test samples. One set of tests was performed on large pieces of aggregate solids removed from the heel solids samples. The other set of dissolution tests was performed on a composite sample prepared from well-drained, air-dry heel solids that were crushed to pass a ï¿½-in. sieve. The bulk density of the composite sample was 2. 04 g/mL. The dissolution tests included water dissolution followed by caustic dissolution testing. In {{each step of the}} three-step water dissolution tests, a volume of water approximately equal to 3 times the initial volume of the test solids was added. In each step, the test samples were gently but thoroughly mixed for approximately 2 days at an average ambient temperature of 25 ï¿½C. The caustic dissolution tests began with the addition of sufficient 49. 6 wt% NaOH to the water dissolution residues to provide &# 8776; 3. 1 moles of OH for each mole of Al estimated to have been present in the starting composite sample and &# 8776; 2. 6 moles of OH for each mole of Al potentially present in the starting aggregate sample. Metathesis of gibbsite to sodium aluminate was then allowed to proceed over 10 days of gentle mixing of the test samples at temperatures ranging from 26 - 30 ï¿½C. The metathesized sodium aluminate was then dissolved by addition of volumes of water approximately equal to 1. 3 times the volumes of caustic added to the test slurries. Aluminate dissolution was allowed to proceed for 2 days at ambient temperatures of &# 8776; 29 ï¿½C. Overall, the sequential water and caustic dissolution tests dissolved and removed 80. 0 wt% of the tank 241 -C- 109 crushed heel solids composite test sample. The 20 wt% of solids remaining after the dissolution tests were 85 - 88 wt% gibbsite. If the density of the residual solids was approximately equal to that of gibbsite, they represented &# 8776; 17 vol% of the initial crushed solids composite test sample. In the water dissolution tests, addition of a volume of water &# 8776; 6. 9 times the initial volume of the crushed solids composite was sufficient to dissolve and recover essentially all of the natrophosphate present. The ratio of the weight of water required to dissolve the natrophosphate solids to the estimated weight of natrophosphate present was 8. 51. The <b>Environmental</b> <b>Simulation</b> <b>Program</b> (OLI Systems, Inc., Morris Plains, New Jersey) predicts that an 8. 36 w/w ratio would be required to dissolve the estimated weight of natrophosphate present in the absence of other components of the heel solids. Only minor amounts of Al-bearing solids were removed from the composite solids in the water dissolution tests. The caustic metathesis/aluminate dissolution test sequence, executed at temperatures ranging from 27 - 30 ï¿½C, dissolved and recovered &# 8776; 69 wt% of the gibbsite estimated to have been present in the initial crushed heel solids composite. This level of gibbsite recovery is consistent with that measured in previous scoping tests on the dissolution of gibbsite in strong caustic solutions. Overall, the sequential water and caustic dissolution tests dissolved and removed 80. 3 wt% of the tank 241 -C- 109 aggregate solids test sample. The residual solids were 92 - 95 wt% gibbsite. Only a minor portion (&# 8776; 4. 5 wt%) of the aggregate solids was dissolved and recovered in the water dissolution test. Other than some smoothing caused by continuous mixing, the aggregates were essentially unaffected by the water dissolution tests. During the caustic metathesis/aluminate dissolution test sequence, &# 8776; 81 wt% of the gibbsite estimated to have been present in the aggregate solids was dissolved and recovered. The pieces of aggregate were significantly reduced in size but persisted as distinct pieces of solids. The increased level of gibbsite recovery, as compared to that for the crushed heel solids composite, suggests that the way the gibbsite solids and caustic solution are mixed is a key determinant of the overall efficiency of gibbsite dissolution and recovery. The liquids recovered after the caustic dissolution tests on the crushed solids composite and the aggregate solids were observed for 170 days. No precipitation of gibbsite was observed. The distribution of particle sizes in the residual solids recovered following the dissolution tests on the crushed heel solids composite was characterized. Wet sieving indicated that 21. 4 wt% of the residual solids were > 710 &# 956;m in size, and laser light scattering indicated that the median equivalent spherical diameter in the 0. 43 in. /s; &# 8776; 68 wt% settled at rates between 0. 02 and 0. 43 in. /s; and &# 8776; 7 wt% settled slower than 0. 02 in. /s...|$|E

40|$|Urban dwellers {{in cities}} located in hot-arid or hothumid regions have greater needs {{to live in}} between outdoor and indoor environments. The {{sustainability}} of urban building design in these regions cannot be fully assessed by indoor <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation</b> not {{taking into account the}} microclimatic factors of the surrounding urban neighbourhood. We find that the current suites of outdoor and indoor simulation software do not connect with each other to give us a holistic understanding of both outdoor and indoor simulation results. This paper reports on our current development of a methodological framework for bridging the current gap between outdoor and indoor <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation.</b> Our objective is that assessment of sustainability at an urban neighbourhood level can be carried out more holistically, and hence achieving more valid <b>environmental</b> <b>simulations</b> from an urban Â dwelling point of view. The outdoor-indoor coupling methodology is currently modelled on a digital work flow among three key software platforms: (1) ENVImet for urban neighbourhood outdoor simulation, (2) Ecotect for building indoor simulation, (3) uCampus for combined outdoor-indoor 3 D visualisation modelling of an entire urban neighbourhood including its individual buildings. A case study of a new neighbourhood development proposed for New Cairo is presented to demonstrate how indoor <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation</b> can be grounded on outdoor <b>environmental</b> <b>simulation</b> of the urban neighbourhood. Graphical outputs from this outdoorindoor coupling approach to neighbourhood simulation can be further brought together onto a Web-based 3 D virtual reality modelling platform to enable wider accessibility...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} boundary integral equation formulas and a corresponding fast 3 -D Stokes flow <b>simulation</b> <b>program</b> named FastStokes to accurately simulate viscous drag forces on geometrically complicated MEMS (micro- electro- mechanical systems) devices. Unlike the 3 -D finite element or finite difference solvers which often take days {{to run to}} completion or fail when geometry gets complicated, the FastStokes 3. 0 <b>simulation</b> <b>program</b> is capable of simulating complicated devices such as resonators, accelerometers, and micro-mirrors on PC computers in minutes. The FastStokes 3. 0 <b>simulation</b> <b>program</b> is a fast 3 -D boundary-element <b>simulation</b> <b>program</b> that uses only surface discretizations. The implementation of the Precorrected-FFT algorithm {{in combination with the}} GMRES algorithm substantially improves the speed of this <b>simulation</b> <b>program.</b> An efficient two-step approach that successfully handles the null space of the singular incompressible Stokes BEM operators is developed to avoid numerical errors and solution discontinuities. An analytical flat-panel kernel integration algorithm is implemented in FastStokes and an accurate curved-panel integration algorithm is also developed...|$|R
