Hypochondriasis is an overvalued <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> one is suffering from an illness, dysmorphophobia is an overvalued <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a part of one's body is abnormal, and people with anorexia nervosa may have an overvalued idea of being thin.|$|E

40|$|In today’s {{networked}} economy, <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> challenge existing {{business models}} and paradigms {{are becoming more}} important. This study investigated how individual differences, groupware-based creativity techniques, and ideas from others influenced the type of <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> individuals generated. While individual differences were important (in that some individuals were inherently more likely to generate <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> followed the existing problem paradigm while others {{were more likely to}} generate paradigm-modifying <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> attempted to change the problem paradigm), the exposure to paradigm-modifying ideas from others and the use of intuitive groupware-based creativity techniques rather than analytical groupware-based creativity techniques were found {{to increase the number of}} paradigm-modifying ideas produced...|$|R
50|$|Sherif saw an {{attitude}} as amalgam of three zones or latitudes. There is the latitude of acceptance, {{which is the}} range of <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> a person sees as reasonable or worthy of consideration; the latitude of rejection, which is the range of <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> a person sees as unreasonable or objectionable; and, finally, the latitude of noncommitment, which is the range of <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> a person sees as neither acceptable nor questionable.|$|R
40|$|Culturally {{counterintuitive}} {{concepts are}} <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> violate {{a small number}} of justifiable expectations raised by shared beliefs of a group of people. Previous studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> violate {{a small number of}} expectations are better remembered by people than <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> conform to their expectations or <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> violate a large number of people’s expectations. However, as counterintuitive ideas become embedded in a group’s belief-system they lose their memorability advantages and must change to regain those advantages. This article presents two case studies conducted to better understand the dynamics of the diffusion of information. It outlines how a cognition and culture approach can help us understand cultural dynamics and offers new insights into rumor diffusion and new religious movement splits...|$|R

5|$|Later Reformed theologians reacted against Barth's {{views on}} baptism by {{appealing}} to Calvin, the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> baptism is a promise rather than an accomplished reality, {{and the idea of}} baptism as a replacement of circumcision. Scottish Reformed theologian T.F. Torrance emphasized the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> baptism is God's word establishing the church, and that the individual's response comes after rather than before God's act in baptism. German Reformed liberation theologian Jürgen Moltmann, on the other hand, saw infant baptism as inappropriately associated with the national church. He saw baptism as properly a free response God's call to discipleship. Reformed churches have generally maintained the practice of infant baptism despite these critiques.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper argues <b>that</b> the <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> win out in {{economics}} {{are not necessarily}} those that a representative researcher would choose, but are rather the emergent result of the competition of ideas in which system replicator dynamics dominate. This means <b>that</b> those <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> fit the analytic technology available to researchers at the time dominate, while “better ” <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> do not offer advancement to researchers lose out. This paper spells out that view and offers a number of suggestions for heterodox European macro economists for competing and shaping the economic institutional environment...|$|R

5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This was the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel {{at the speed of}} light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
5|$|Punctuated {{equilibrium}} {{is commonly}} contrasted against phyletic gradualism, the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> evolution generally occurs uniformly {{and by the}} steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called anagenesis).

5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, is the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely {{based on the}} common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another {{idea is that the}} Maine Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E

5|$|Another <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> McDonnell {{proposed}} was {{a variation}} of a carrier-based Phantom, {{with the goal of}} improving catapult performance and lowering approach speeds. The F-4(HL) would have had a longer fuselage and wingspan, with less sweep, stabilators with increased area and air intakes with auxiliary blow-in doors to increase airflow at low speeds. This proposal was not taken forward.|$|E
5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may be that Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E
