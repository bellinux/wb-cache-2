50|$|Wedgefishes are rays of {{the family}} Rhinidae, {{comprising}} ten species in three genera. Classified in the order Rhinopristiformes along with guitarfishes and sawfishes, they have also been known as <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfishes</b> or sharkfin guitarfishes.|$|E
50|$|Glaucostegus, {{also known}} as <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfishes,</b> is a genus of large Indo-Pacific rays, with a single species, G. cemiculus, in the East Atlantic and Mediterranean. They were {{formerly}} classified in the family Rhinobatidae but are now recognized as a distinct family, Glaucostegidae.|$|E
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish</b> was {{previously}} believed to range throughout {{a large part}} of the Indo-Pacific, but recent evidence has shown that it, as traditionally defined, actually was a species complex consisting of four different species. In addition to the <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish,</b> this complex includes the white-spotted guitarfish, the broadnose wedgefish and possibly the smoothnose wedgefish. With these as separate species, the <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish</b> has a relatively restricted range: It is found only in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, and the western Indian Ocean as far south as South Africa.|$|R
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish</b> {{feeds on}} bivalves, crabs, lobsters, squid and small fish.|$|R
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>{{guitarfish}}</b> (Rhynchobatus djiddensis), {{also known}} as the whitespotted wedgefish is a large species of guitarfish in the family Rhinidae. It is restricted to the Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and western Indian Ocean, but was formerly considered more widespread due to confusion with its relatives.|$|R
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish</b> is {{harmless}} to humans. It {{is listed}} as vulnerable on the IUCN red list as its population {{are believed to have}} declined significantly due to unregulated high levels of exploitation for its flesh and fins; the latter for shark fin soup. Its low fecundity and presumed slow growth rate make it highly vulnerable to unsustainable exploitation.|$|R
50|$|Rhynchobatus australiae, {{also called}} the white-spotted guitarfish, white-spotted wedgefish or {{bottlenose}} wedgefish, is a species of fish in the Rhinidae family. It is found from shallow waters {{to a depth of}} at least 60 m in the Indo-Pacific, ranging from the East African coast and the Red Sea, to Taiwan, the Philippines and Australia. It is part of a species complex that also includes the <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish,</b> the broadnose wedgefish and possibly the smoothnose wedgefish.|$|R
50|$|The common shovelnose ray, giant shovelnose ray or <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Glaucostegus typus) is {{a species}} of fish in the Rhinobatidae family found in the central Indo-Pacific, ranging from India to the East China Sea, Solomon Islands and {{northern}} Australia. It is found in shallow coastal areas {{to a depth of}} at least 100 m, including mangrove, estuaries and reportedly also in freshwaters. It reaches up to 2.7 m in length, and is greyish-brown to yellowish-brown above with a paler snout.|$|R
40|$|Twenty-four years (1977 – 2000) of {{competitive}} shore angling catch and effort {{data from the}} KwaZulu-Natal Coastal Anglers Union for the province of KwaZulu-Natal were analysed. Of a minimum of 117 species recorded, the most commonly caught species were dusky shark  (Carcharhinus obscurus) (26 %), milk shark (Rhizoprionodon acutus) (18 %) and shad (Pomatomus saltatrix) (10 %). By weight, the top species were dusky shark (34 %) and diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) (19 %). All the above species showed considerable inter-annual variation in their respective contributions to annual catch. Probably {{as a result of}} changes in fishing patterns, dusky shark and milk shark showed a general decline in percentage contribution to catch over the period, while contributions of lesser <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhinobatos annulatus), <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhynchobatus djiddensis), diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) and brown ray (Himantura gerrardi) increased. Mean overall annual cpue by number and weight showed a non-significant increase over the period, while each of the investigated species showed a constant trend in mean annual weight. There were high proportions of juveniles in the catches of dusky shark (100 %), dusky kob (92 %) and <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (78 %). Improvements made to the structure of shore angling competitions and the overall contribution of competition angling to resource management in South Africa is discussed. </strong...|$|R
5000|$|The {{great hammerhead}} is {{extremely}} vulnerable to overfishing {{due to its}} low overall abundance and long generation time. Assessment of its conservation status is difficult as few fisheries separate the great hammerhead from other hammerheads in their reported catches. This species is listed as globally Endangered on the IUCN Red List. It is Endangered in the northwestern Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, where {{though it is a}} non-targeted species, populations have dropped 50% since the 1990s due to bycatch. It is also Endangered in the southwestern Indian Ocean, where large numbers of longline vessels operate illegally along the coasts for hammerheads and the <b>giant</b> <b>guitarfish</b> (Rhynchobatus djiddensis). The great hammerhead catch rate in Indian Ocean has declined 73% from 1978 to 2003, though it is yet undetermined whether these represent localized or widespread depletion. The great hammerhead is Critically Endangered along the western coast of Africa, where stocks have collapsed with an estimated 80% decline in the past 25 years. The West African Sub-Regional Fishing Commission (SRFC) has recognized the great hammerhead as one of the four most threatened species in the region, though fishing continues unmonitored and unregulated. Off northern Australia, this species was assessed as Data Deficient but at [...] "high risk". Concern has arisen there over a substantial increase in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing, reflecting the raising value of this shark's fins.|$|R
5000|$|Atlantis is themed to {{look like}} an Atlantis Temple, and with a volume of 500000 gal L it is the largest tank in the aquarium. Atlantis is home to seven shark species: Sand tiger sharks, Nurse sharks, Brown shark, Wobbegong sharks, White tip reef sharks, Black tip reef sharks, and Zebra sharks. It also {{contains}} southern stingrays, <b>giant</b> shovel-nosed <b>guitarfish,</b> and green sawfish. Atlantis is also home to several sea turtles - two Loggerhead sea turtles, two Kemp's Riddley sea turtles, and a Giant Green Sea Turtles which was added in March 2011. In addition, it has groupers, red snappers, red drums, pork fish, jacks, permits, and many more species.|$|R
