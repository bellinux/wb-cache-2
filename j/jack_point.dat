On June 2, 1856, Washington and his company were {{attacked}} at their encampment near Baldwin City, Kansas by anti-slavery Free-Stater forces under the leadership of abolitionist John Brown. Upon seeing that the Free-Staters' reinforcements were nearby, Captain Pate instructed Washington to send for reinforcements of their own. Washington departed during {{the early stages of the}} engagement to send for reinforcements, and sustained slight wounds. Pate surrendered to Brown and his men, and Brown took 25 of the Border Ruffians as prisoners. The attack came to be known as the Battle of Black Jack or the Black <b>Jack</b> <b>Point</b> Affray.|$|E

500|$|Grossmith {{was a hit}} as the tradesmanlike John Wellington Wells, {{the title}} role in The Sorcerer, and became a regular member of Richard D'Oyly Carte's company. [...] He created all nine of the lead comic {{baritone}} roles in Gilbert and Sullivan's famous Savoy Operas in London from 1877 to 1889, including the pompous First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Joseph Porter, in H.M.S. Pinafore (1878); Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, who is an expert at everything except [...] "military knowledge" [...] (1880); the aesthetic poet, Reginald Bunthorne in Patience (1881); the love-lonely Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe (1882); the sarcastic cripple, King Gama, in Princess Ida (1884); Ko-Ko the cheap tailor, elevated to the post of Lord High Executioner, in The Mikado (1885); the accursed Robin Oakapple in Ruddigore (1887); and the pathetic jester, <b>Jack</b> <b>Point,</b> in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888). On 29 January 1887, {{one week after the}} opening night of Ruddigore, Grossmith fell dangerously ill. However, by 13 February, his physicians pronounced him convalescent, and he resumed the role of Robin by 18 February. During Grossmith's absence, his understudy Henry Lytton, who would later become the principal comedian of the company, had the opportunity to perform the role in Grossmith's place.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) {{is upset}} that Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{cross-dressing}} on TGS {{because it is}} demeaning to African-Americans. After a bit of objection, Toofer convinces Tracy to stop, handing the female character over to Josh Girard (Lonny Ross). Once Josh's character is successful, Tracy is upset with Toofer. Liz convinces Toofer to work with Tracy. As they work together, Tracy gets upset with Toofer's supposed lack of blackness, and endearingly calls Toofer a racial slur. The next morning, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), Liz, Toofer, and Tracy {{sit down for a}} meeting about Tracy's vocabulary from the previous night. Tracy and <b>Jack</b> <b>point</b> out that the African-American community has adopted the word to deprive it of its meaning. In trying to reach out to Tracy, Toofer says the word again but because of his perceived cultural whiteness, everyone, including Tracy, is offended in a way they weren't when Tracy used the term. Tracy and Toofer attend sensitivity training, start arguing, and in the process develop a new sketch for TGS. When show starts running short on time, Liz offers Tracy the option to either air the sketch or one from the Star Jones cooking show, Tracy chooses the latter. Toofer is initially upset, but agrees with Tracy's decision when he finds the sketch funny.|$|E

2500|$|Lytton {{continued}} to serve almost continuously in D'Oyly Carte touring companies as principal comedian until 1897. On tour, {{by the end}} of 1888, Lytton had played several more of the Gilbert and Sullivan principal comic roles. [...] In addition to Robin, he began to play Ko-Ko in The Mikado, Major-General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore, and <b>Jack</b> <b>Point</b> the jester in The Yeomen of the Guard, which became his favourite role. [...] Unlike Grossmith, who gave the opera a comic ending, Lytton's <b>Jack</b> <b>Point,</b> following the example of George Thorne (another D'Oyly Carte touring artist), died of a broken heart at the end. [...] Carte and Gilbert blessed the departure from Grossmith's interpretation. In subsequent years, he portrayed these and the other principal comic Gilbert and Sullivan roles played by the D'Oyly Carte touring companies in which he played.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1951, exactly {{six years}} after joining the company, Pratt became the {{principal}} comedian following Green's departure, and he served in that capacity for the next eight seasons, playing Sir Joseph Porter in Pinafore, the Major-General in The Pirates of Penzance, Bunthorne in Patience, the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, Ko-Ko in The Mikado, Robin in Ruddigore, <b>Jack</b> <b>Point</b> in The Yeomen of the Guard, the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers and King Gama in Princess Ida. In 1953, his first London season as principal comedian, The Times reviewed him {{in the role of}} the Lord Chancellor: [...] "Mr. Peter Pratt... had a good delivery, a quiet manner, and a nimble pair of legs that contrasted suddenly and superbly with his dry demeanour. [...] He refrained from overplaying the part". [...] In reviewing a 1956 Ruddigore, The Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Pratt showed true operatic talent in the [...] changing the colour of his tone and the expression of his face with decisive skill." [...] In a 1957 review, a correspondent for The Times called Pratt's <b>Jack</b> <b>Point,</b> in Yeomen, [...] "very human, not over-dramatized".|$|E
2500|$|In 1931, Menzies {{joined the}} J. C. Williamson Gilbert and Sullivan company in Australia. He toured {{extensively}} with that company as Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S.

2500|$|During {{these early}} seasons, Menzies understudied Henry Lytton, Leo Sheffield and other {{principal}} comedians {{of the company}} and appeared occasionally in the leading comedy roles of the Learned Judge in Trial, Major General Stanley in The Pirates of Penzance, the Lord Chancellor in Iolanthe, <b>Jack</b> <b>Point</b> in Yeomen, and the Duke of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers. [...] Menzies related that [...] "The first time I played the Duke of Plaza-Toro, I started by catching my spurs and falling into the canal. [...] It was decidedly not traditional." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 1939, at the {{outbreak}} of World War II, the British government ordered all theatres to close indefinitely. [...] Rupert D'Oyly Carte cancelled the company's entire autumn tour and terminated the contracts of all of his performers. Green immediately arranged for an engagement with Charles B. Cochran {{to appear in the}} Noel Gay revue Lights Up at the Savoy Theatre. [...] On Christmas Day 1939, the D'Oyly Carte resumed performing, and since Green was not available, they engaged Grahame Clifford to play Green's roles. [...] After the Cochran review, Green appeared with other companies, including touring with Sylvia Cecil in variety halls in their act, [...] "Words with Music," [...] which included Gilbert and Sullivan songs. [...] He then joined the Royal Air Force, serving as an instructor and administrator from 1941 to 1945. Green returned to the company in 1946 as principal comedian for another five years. [...] During this time, he recorded most of the patter roles in the earliest D'Oyly Carte LP recordings. For a generation of Gilbert & Sullivan fans, his performances in those recordings were considered definitive. [...] Billboard wrote, during the company's 1948 US tour, that his performance of <b>Jack</b> <b>Point</b> [...] "is another triumph. ... His <b>Jack</b> <b>Point</b> is a G. and S. portrait to be cherished." ...|$|E

[...] Marriner's recording from the same year contains some of the dialogue and is considered strong. [...] The 1995 Mackerras recording is also admired.
