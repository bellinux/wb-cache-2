5|$|It {{lasted for}} five months, from 12 February to 12 July 1691. The {{conclave}} became deadlocked after Catholic monarchs opposed {{the election of}} Gregorio Barbarigo, who {{some members of the}} College of Cardinals also viewed as too strict. The conclave only ended in the July when cardinals started to become ill <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat,</b> and after French cardinals agreed to vote for Pignatelli despite him coming from Spanish-controlled Naples.|$|E
5|$|Tall eucalypts {{that are}} {{emergent}} over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. It {{is here that}} the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the day. They often socialise before dusk, engaging in preening, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather.|$|E
5|$|The sole female Togolese athlete at the 2004 Games, Sandrine Thiébaud-Kangni, {{competed in}} the 400 metres. She ran in the fifth heat on 21 August, {{finishing}} {{in a time of}} 52.87 seconds in seventh position. This was only ahead of Sri Lanka's Damayanthi Dharsha (54.58 seconds), but was outside the time of Mireille Nguimgo from Cameroon (51.90 seconds), who was the slowest qualifier <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat.</b> Thiébaud-Kangni did not progress to the following round.|$|E

Levy Moshoeshoe Makoanyane {{took part in the}} men's 100m and 200m (T46) at the 2000 Games, failing to advance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heats</b> in either event. Limpho Rakoto competed in the women's 100m (T46) in both the 2000 and the 2004 Games, and also failed to advance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heats.</b> Sello Mothebe ran in the men's 100m (T12) in 2004, with the same outcome.

5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after the nose of the aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E
5|$|Reported {{details about}} the event, such as water boiling in the muddy crater for ten minutes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of the impact, {{presented}} a problem for experts. Because the impact site is at a high altitude of more than , the meteoroid {{may not have been}} slowed down as much as it ordinarily would have been by passage through the Earth’s denser lower atmosphere, and kinetic energy at impact may have been unusually high for a terrestrial impact of an object of this size and mass. Most larger meteorites are cold in their bulk mass when they land on Earth, since their heated outer layers ablate from the objects before impacting. It was later confirmed that the meteorite contained a large amount of iron and possessed magnetic properties common to similar metallic objects, which contributed to its capacity to retain heat during atmospheric entry.|$|E
5|$|The Serbian {{defeat in}} the Serbian Campaign in autumn 1915, {{prompted}} France and Britain to transfer troops from the Gallipoli Campaign to Greek Macedonia. The Macedonian Front was established to support {{the remnants of the}} Serbian army to conquer Vardar Macedonia. After the failure of the August Offensive, the Gallipoli campaign drifted. Ottoman success began to affect public opinion in Britain, with criticism of Hamilton's performance being smuggled out by Keith Murdoch, Ellis Ashmead-Bartlett and other reporters. Stopford and other dissident officers also contributed to the air of gloom and the possibility of evacuation was raised on 11 October 1915. Hamilton resisted the suggestion, fearing the damage to British prestige but was sacked shortly afterwards and replaced by Lieutenant General Sir Charles Monro. Autumn and winter brought relief <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> but also led to gales, blizzards and flooding, resulting in men drowning and freezing to death, while thousands suffered frostbite.|$|E

5|$|The women {{worked from}} 8:30a.m. to 3:30p.m. daily – not long hours – but the working {{conditions}} were probably unbearable by modern standards. New Orleans has a warm, wet climate. The process of adjusting, however, required the utmost {{attention to the}} scales' balance, and the slightest draft could upset it. The draft could also carry off the silver dust from the coin planchets the women would file. For these reasons the windows and doors were almost always kept shut, resulting in a very hot working environment. Workers relied on water coolers to provide relief <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> and avoid dehydration. The women mint employees were judged to enjoy better working conditions than many other American women workers {{in the late nineteenth}} century.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} types of thunderstorms: single-cell, {{multi-cell}} cluster, multi-cell lines, and supercells. Supercell thunderstorms are the strongest and most severe. Mesoscale convective systems formed by favorable vertical wind shear within the tropics and subtropics can {{be responsible for the}} development of hurricanes. Dry thunderstorms, with no precipitation, can cause the outbreak of wildfires <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> generated from the cloud-to-ground lightning that accompanies them. Several means are used to study thunderstorms: weather radar, weather stations, and video photography. Past civilizations held various myths concerning thunderstorms and their development as late as the 18th century. Beyond the Earth's atmosphere, thunderstorms have also been observed on the planets of Jupiter, Saturn, Neptune, and, probably, Venus.|$|E
5|$|As {{wildfire}} is {{a natural}} part of most ecosystems, plants that are indigenous to Yellowstone have adapted in a variety of ways. Douglas-fir have a thick bark which protects the inner section of the tree from most fires. Lodgepole Pines —the most common tree species in the park— generally have cones that are only opened by the heat of fire. Their seeds are held in place by a tough resin, and fire assists in melting the resin, allowing the seeds to disperse. Fire clears out dead and downed wood, providing fewer obstacles for lodgepole pines to flourish. Subalpine Fir, Engelmann Spruce, Whitebark Pine, and other species tend to grow in colder and moister areas, where fire is less likely to occur. Aspen trees sprout new growth from their roots, and even if a severe fire kills the tree above ground, the roots often survive unharmed because they are insulated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> by soil. The National Park Service estimates that in natural conditions, grasslands in Yellowstone burned an average of every 20 to 25 years, while forests in the park would experience fire about every 300 years.|$|E

5|$|Jackson Niyomugao, {{at the age}} of 24, was {{the only}} Rwandian {{competitor}} in the London Games to have participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He qualified the Games after receiving a wildcard from the Olympic Solidarity Committee which was announced in the week {{before the start of the}} Olympics and was the last Rwandan athlete to attain qualification. After being eliminated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> stages in the previous Olympic Games in Beijing Niyomugao said he wanted to win a medal in London and that if he had more support, he would possibly be able to swim quicker but hoped to see the results. He was drawn in the second heat held on 2 August, finishing fourth out of seven swimmers, with a time of 27.38 seconds. He ranked ahead of Uganda's Ganzi Mugula (27.58 seconds) and Paul Edingue Ekane from Cameroon (27.87 seconds) but behind Ching Maou Wei of American Samoa (27.30 seconds) in a heat led by Abdourahman Osman from Djibouti (27.25 seconds). Overall Niyomugao finished 52nd out of 58 competitors overall, but did not progress to the semi-finals because her time was 5.11 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later stages.|$|E
5|$|One day at Emain Macha, Cú Chulainn overhears Cathbad {{teaching}} his pupils. One {{asks him}} what that day is auspicious for, and Cathbad replies that any warrior who takes arms that day will have everlasting fame. Cú Chulainn, though only seven years old, goes to Conchobar {{and asks for}} arms. None of the weapons given to him withstand his strength, until Conchobar gives him his own weapons. But when Cathbad sees this he grieves, because he had not finished his prophecy—the warrior who took arms that day would be famous, but his life would be short. Soon afterwards, {{in response to a}} similar prophecy by Cathbad, Cú Chulainn demands a chariot from Conchobar, and only the king's own chariot withstands him. He sets off on a foray and kills the three sons of Nechtan Scéne, who had boasted they had killed more Ulstermen than there were Ulstermen still living. He returns to Emain Macha in his battle frenzy, and the Ulstermen are afraid he will slaughter them all. Conchobar's wife Mugain leads out the women of Emain, and they bare their breasts to him. He averts his eyes, and the Ulstermen wrestle him into a barrel of cold water, which explodes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> of his body. They put him in a second barrel, which boils, and a third, which warms to a pleasant temperature.|$|E
