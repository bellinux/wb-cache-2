2500|$|Khouri is a screenwriter, director, producer, feminist, lecturer, {{and author}} of non-fiction. She also worked as an actress, lecturer, and waiter in Nashville. While working {{for a company that}} made {{commercials}} and music videos, she began writing Thelma & Louise, her first produced screenplay. Thelma & Louise won Khouri the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay, a Golden Globe Award, and a PEN Literary Award, as well as the London Film Critics Circle Award for Film of the Year and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. According to an interview done by David Konow, a scholarly author and journalist, Callie Khouri mentioned her experience filming her first major film, Thelma & Louise. “While I was writing Thelma and Louise, it was the most fun I had ever had in my life, bar none,” she says. “It was such a pure experience. There was no self-censorship there, there was no second guessing. From a creative standpoint, it was the freest I had ever been in my life. I loved every moment I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> time with those characters. Nothing came close to it, including winning all the awards and everything else. As much fun as all that was, it wasn’t as much fun as sitting alone in a crummy office on Vine at 2 in the morning writing that screenplay.” At the Oscar ceremony she said, [...] "for everyone who wanted to see a happy ending for 'Thelma and Louise', for me this is it," [...] brandishing the statue high. After winning the Academy Awards for her best screenplay, she felt motivated enough to continue on with her career and express [...] "her feelings about the lack of female directors in Hollywood", not to mention that most of her career began because of her stand on women's rights. In an interview done by The Huffington Post, she addressed that adult women [...] "are a market that I feel is underserved in the entertainment population at large. I don’t see the kind of women represented that I know or that I’m attracted to. I really want to try to write more nuanced, less simplistic kind of stuff, and its hard {{to find a place to}} do that." ...|$|E
