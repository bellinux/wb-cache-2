40|$|Abstract. The NC {{incremental}} {{sheet metal}} forming technology is a flexible forming technology without dedicated forming dies. The forming locus of the forming tool can be adjusted by correcting the numerical model of the product. Because the deformation of sheet metal only occurs around the tool head and the deformed region is subjected to stretch deformation, the deformed region of sheet metal thins, and surface area increases. Sheet metal forming stepwise is {{to lead to the}} whole sheet metal deformation. The principle of NC incremental {{sheet metal forming}} and the forming process of the fender are introduced. The effect of process parameters on forming is analysed. The improvement method of the forming quality is suggested. The groove is created in the starting point of tool moving when the starting point of tool moving locus at all layers is identical. The groove can be eliminated when the starting point of tool moving locus at all layers is different. The <b>feed</b> <b>pitch</b> p increase, the process time decrease, production rate and surface degree of roughness increase. In general, the <b>feed</b> <b>pitch</b> is 0. 25 mm...|$|E
30|$|Then, {{volumetric}} pelvic CT is acquired {{at maximum}} bladder distension. During initial experience, acquisition parameters on our four-slice MDCT included 120  kV tube voltage, 245 - 280  mA tube current, 4 [*]×[*] 2.5  mm collimation, 7.5  mm/gantry rotation table <b>feed</b> (<b>pitch</b> 0.75), and 2.5 / 1.25  mm slice thickness/reconstruction index. Currently, acquisition on a 64 -slice scanner involves tube current adjusted to body weight using automatic dose modulation, 64 [*]×[*] 0.625  mm collimation, 0.891 MD pitch, and 2 / 1  mm slice thickness/reconstruction index. Additionally, intravenous contrast medium may be used, particularly when looking for neoplastic or inflammatory processes.|$|E

25|$|Microcephaly is a {{disorder}} {{in which the}} circumference of the head is smaller than average for the person's age and gender. Most children with microcephaly also have a smaller than typical brain and intellectual disability. Some {{of the most common}} signs and symptoms associated with microcephaly are seizures, poor <b>feeding,</b> high <b>pitched</b> cry, intellectual disability, developmental delay, and increased movement of arms and legs.|$|R
40|$|This study {{considers}} two computational approaches, mastercam simulation {{and genetic}} algorithm (GA) optimization, {{to estimate the}} optimal process parameters {{that lead to the}} minimum production time of sport rim. The considered process parameters include <b>feed</b> rate, <b>pitch</b> rate, pull rate and spindle speed which represent the fitness function. The results showed that the minimum production time estimated by mastercam and GA are 91. 03 and 70. 99 minutes, respectively. Subsequently, GA has reduced the minimum production time of mastercam by about 22 %...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{addresses}} axial ultrasonic-vibration-assisted {{helical milling}} of chemically strengthened glass. Axial ultrasonic vibration {{was applied to}} a milling tool using an ultrasonic device to obtain longer tool life, higher machining accuracies, and improved cutting efficiency. The effects of ultrasonic vibration on microscale, through-hole helical milling of chemically strengthened glass were investigated {{and the impact of}} three cutting parameters (<b>feed</b> velocity, <b>pitch</b> per revolution, rotation speed) on the characteristics of surface chippings was evaluated. The results of the cutting tests clearly showed a reduction of chipping size and an improvement in tool life by using the proposed manufacturing method. Finally, optimum cutting conditions were proposed {{based on the results of}} the milling tests...|$|R

40|$|The {{recently}} commercialized FLEXICOKING Process has {{a significant}} {{role to play in}} developing, known heavy oil reserves. The process upgrades virtually any pumpable <b>feed</b> including residual, <b>pitch</b> or total crude. Combined with HYDROFINING, it produces a clean product slate composed of low Btu gas, high Btu gas, LPG, naphtha, distillate and gas oil. The low Btu gas falls within the definition of an "Alternate Fuel" under current legislation (PL 95 - 620). Originally developed for refinery bottoms conversion, the FLEXICOKING process can also be used as the primary technology for Stand Alone Energy Centers upgrading low quality, high metals, heavy crudes. These efficient energy centers can be located either at a heavy oil production field or integrated with an energy-intensive industrial complex...|$|R
40|$|In December 2003, the Dutch-Belgian NELSON trial, a Dutch {{acronym for}} "Nederlands-Leuvens Longkanker Screenings ONderzoek", has been launched. Primary {{objective}} of the NELSON trial is to investigate whether screening for lung cancer by 16 -detector multi-slice CT with 16 mm x 0. 75 mm collimation and 15 mm table <b>feed</b> per rotation (<b>pitch</b> = 1. 5) in year 1, 2 and 4 wilt lead to a decrease in lung cancer mortality in high risk subjects of at least 25 % compared to a control group which receives no screening. In this paper, the screening regimen and the classification {{and management of the}} screen-detected nodules at baseline and incidence screening is presented. This is the first large lung cancer screening trial in which the nodule management protocol is based on volumetric nodule assessment and {{the presence or absence of}} growth. Furthermore, the quality assurance measures and the NELSON management system (NMS) are presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
