25|$|Mock bombardments of {{imaginary}} shore {{positions were}} carried out by Prince David in Saanich Inlet, and equally imaginary shore batteries fired back, while movie raiders rowed the ship's boats ashore {{as hard as they}} could. A ship-handling problem peculiar to this operation was that in every scene where Prince David was to appear herself, she could present only her starboard side to the camera. It was calculated that cinema-goers would not likely accept the huge sound truck that had been hoisted aboard, and reposed on the weather deck port side, as a regular item in Combined Operations weaponry. The ship's company co-operated heartily, and kept up a high standard of discipline and war-readiness despite the distractions of this fling with film fame, and the <b>glitter</b> <b>of</b> hob-nobbing with the film famous.|$|E
500|$|Details of the {{operation}} of Day & Martin in 1842 [...] reveal that the blacking they produced was in two forms, bottled liquid, and a thick paste which was available in either small wide-mouthed stone tubs, slabs wrapped in oiled paper, or in [...] "circular tin-boxes, about three inches in diameter, and half or three-quarters of an inch thick". The tinned blacking paste was at this time exclusively for army use. The text states [...] "Yet, as the soldier’s boots or shoes must to some extent emulate the brightness and <b>glitter</b> <b>of</b> the boots of those who pay for battles instead of fighting them, a portable blacking apparatus is provided." [...] This confirms the tins as polish rather than dubbin.|$|E
500|$|Mitică and Lache and Mache {{have often}} been seen as three manifestations of a main type in Caragiale's work—the petty clerk who spends his time off in lively company. Literary {{historian}} Garabet Ibrăileanu, an adherent to the left-wing trend known as Poporanism, {{was among the first}} to stress that Mitică's name, like those of Lache and Mache, was actually supposed to enhance his everyday nature, while arguing that the character stood for the first generation of commoners with access to education. Ibrăileanu, who criticized Caragiale for his satirical overview of the social process, believed that the clerks in his work are unnecessarily cynical, and stressed that Inspecţiune was the only one of his works were [...] "one sees at least one <b>glitter</b> <b>of</b> kindness in the souls of the mitici".|$|E
50|$|According to Ancient Egyptian mythology, the Akh-bird was {{believed}} to be the representation of the human spirit (Egyptian: Akh).

A similar belief is known from Persian bedouins, who worship the northern bald ibis as a bearer of the deceased's soul.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first known}} musical {{entertainments}} (other than those provided by First Nations residents, and informally by mill workers, sailors, loggers and tavern keepers) {{in what would}} later become Vancouver were Methodist church services led by a Mrs. Sullivan in Gastown, who was of West Indian origin.

[...] Among them was Bunin. In a by and large grim gallery of his literary portraits (most of them crude caricatures), Lokhvitskaya was the only person whom he remembered fondly. [...] "Everything in her was charming: the sound of her voice, the liveliness of her speech, the <b>glitter</b> <b>of</b> her eye, her wonderful facetiousness. The colour of her face was exceptionally beautiful: opaque and smooth, like that of a ripe Crimean apple," [...] Bunin wrote in his memoirs.|$|E

2500|$|The play {{opened at}} the Globe Theatre in May 1949 and had a {{successful}} run in London for a year. Writer and journalist Samantha Ellis of The Guardian, in her overview of the play, thought critics found Burton to be [...] "most authentic" [...] for his role. Gielgud took the play to Broadway in the United States, where it {{opened at the}} Royale Theatre on 8 November 1950. Theatre critic Brooks Atkinson appreciated the performances and praised the play's [...] "hard <b>glitter</b> <b>of</b> wit and skepticism", while describing Fry as precocious with [...] "a touch of genius". The play ran on Broadway until 17 March 1951, and received the New York Drama Critics' Circle award for the Best Foreign Play of 1951. Burton received the Theatre World Award for his performance, his first major award.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Manaus were {{neighbors of}} a large lake, & even several Great Lakes; because they are very {{frequent}} in a low country [...] subject to flooding. The Manaus pulled gold from the Yquiari & seized small flakes: these are real facts, which were used in exaggeration, giving rise to the fable {{of the city of}} Manoa & Golden Lake. If we find that there {{is still a long way}} from the small flakes of gold of the Manaus, to the [...] roofs of the town of Manoa, & that there is nonetheless far from the <b>glitter</b> <b>of</b> this metal, ripped from the waters of the Yquiari, to the fable of Parime gold; one cannot deny that on the one hand greed & concern of Europeans who wanted by any force to find what they were looking for, and on the other, clever liars & exaggerating Indians , interested in sending away the uncomfortable visitors, might alter & deface [...] to the point of making them unrecognizable.

2500|$|In parallel, he was {{involved}} in a dispute with Raicu Ionescu-Rion and Garabet Ibrăileanu, after he allowed psychological novel techniques to seep into his prose and spoke in favor of the Decadent movement (placing decadent novels on equal footing with works of social criticism). His primordial interest in the subjective experience led him to claim that there was no possibility for a completely objective perspective (an idea akin to his Impressionist tenets). He argued: [...] "I understand the word writing to mean the original, superior and beautiful gift of materializing a personality, an artistic temperament, in the shape of words. But this disposition does not always manifest itself with the exactitude of clocks; it is often capricious and pertains to various exterior and psychic causes. First of all, the artist needs an absolute material self-sufficiency which may lead him away from all common employments that kill or weaken the most beautiful forces of talent. Not all poets are born rich like Alecsandri; and since in our country literature has not yet come to live off public support, it is only natural that one often sees talented poets abducted by political journalism or the <b>glitter</b> <b>of</b> other jobs which provide them with the means of existence..." ...|$|E

I would not trust to convulsive fear {{the sight of the}} terrible incision. Yet – when the dreadful steel was plunged into the breast – cutting through veins – arteries – flesh – nerves – I needed no injunctions not to restrain my cries. I began a scream that lasted unintermittingly during the whole time of the incision – & I almost marvel that it rings not in my Ears still? so excruciating was the agony. When the wound was made, & the instrument was withdrawn, the pain seemed undiminished, for the air that suddenly rushed into those delicate parts felt like a mass of minute but sharp & forked poniards, that were tearing the edges of the wound. I concluded the operation was over – Oh no! presently the terrible cutting was renewed – & worse than ever, to separate the bottom, the foundation of this dreadful gland from the parts to which it adhered – Again all description would be baffled – yet again all was not over, – Dr. Larry rested but his own hand, & – Oh heaven! – I then felt the knife (rack)ling against the breast bone – scraping it! ...|$|E
