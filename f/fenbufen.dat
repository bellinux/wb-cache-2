40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Fenbufen</b> is a non-selective non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug (NSAID), used {{to treat}} acute and chronic painful conditions. There is no known systematic review of its use in acute postoperative pain. OBJECTIVES: To assess efficacy, duration of action, and associated adverse events of single dose oral <b>fenbufen</b> in acute postoperative pain in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched Cochrane CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Oxford Pain Relief database for studies to June 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trials of single dose orally administered <b>fenbufen</b> in adults with moderate to severe acute postoperative pain. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. Pain relief or pain intensity data were extracted and converted into the dichotomous outcome of number of participants with at least 50 % pain relief over 4 to 6 hours, from which relative risk and number needed to treat to benefit (NNT) were calculated. Numbers of participants using rescue medication over specified time periods, and time to use of rescue medication, were sought as additional measures of efficacy. Information on adverse events and withdrawals were collected. MAIN RESULTS: Searches identified only one study with (90 participants in total, 31 taking <b>fenbufen).</b> The study compared oral <b>fenbufen</b> 800 mg, <b>fenbufen</b> 400 mg, and placebo in participants with established postoperative pain. <b>Fenbufen</b> at both doses had apparent analgesic efficacy, but the numbers of participants {{was too small to}} allow sensible analysis. Gastrointestinal adverse events were noted in 4 of 15 participants taking <b>fenbufen</b> 800 mg. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of evidence of efficacy for oral <b>fenbufen</b> in acute postoperative pain, its use in this indication is not justified at present. Because trials clearly demonstrating analgesic efficacy in the most basic of acute pain studies is lacking, use in other indications should be evaluated carefully. Given the large number of available drugs of this and similar classes which are effective, there is no urgent research agenda for this particular drug...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fenbufen</b> is an analgesic, {{antipyretic}} and anti-inflammatory {{drug that}} {{is characterized by}} poor water solubility, a defect increased by very low wettability. Poor water solubility, particularly at low pH, could decrease absorption in {{the upper part of}} the gastrointestinal tract, which would be inconvenient for good bioavailability. Different spherical crystallization processes have been considered as methods to improve <b>fenbufen</b> dissolution behavior. A two-solvent system, in the presence of a bridging liquid, is the only method capable of producing spherical <b>fenbufen</b> crystals. In a first step, <b>fenbufen</b> solubility was considered in different solvents. The drug crystals formed were typically needle shaped. This characteristic was considered as a favorable parameter to obtain spherical crystals. After the selection of the best <b>fenbufen</b> solvent, several ratios of solvent (S) –nonsolvent (NS) (tetrahydrofuran [THF]–demineralized water) were studied. The addition of a bridging liquid (isopropyl acetate) improved spherical crystallization. The results from this method were reproducible batch to batch. The spherical crystals obtained showed a clear improvement in dissolution capacity, probably due to better wettability. Dissolution studies were then carried out on these spherical crystals stored for 1 month at different relative humidities (RHs). The dissolution profiles remained unchanged...|$|E

40|$|Curcumin is {{the major}} {{phenolic}} diarylheptane derivative in Curcuma longa and {{has been reported to}} possess pharmacological activities. Unfortunately this compound suffers from poor bioavailability and rapid neutral-alkaline degradation. Co-crystal of curcumin is one option under exploration, motivated by the fact that a number of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) co-crystals with improved dissolution have recently been synthesized. Hence, co-crystallization technique highlights an alternative means to improve the performance of curcumin. Within our work evidences for a co-crystal was ascertained from DSC, Kofler hot stage screening and PXRD, and all confirmed a new crystal phase could have been formed between curcumin and a co-crystallizing agent, nicotinamide. We report that re-crystallization step essentially aids the purification of commercial curcumin, a herbal based actives. Otherwise the prevalence of a new crystal phase in solvent-mediated co-crystallization will be significantly reduced. Besides, phase diagram is an effective tool for the study of solubility behaviours in co-crystal system. In order to acquire related techniques, <b>fenbufen,</b> a poorly water soluble drug, was selected.

40|$|Co-crystal {{screening}} {{is routinely}} undertaken using high-throughput solution growth. We report a low- to medium-throughput approach, encompassing both a melt and solution crystallization step as a {{route to the}} identification of co-crystals. Prior to solution studies, a melt growth step was included utilizing the Kofler mixed fusion method. This method allowed elucidation of the thermodynamic landscape within the binary phase diagram and was found to increase overall screening efficiency. The pharmaceutically acceptable adduct nicotinamide was selected and screened against a small set of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) (ibuprofen (both the racemic compound (R/S) and S-enantiomer), <b>fenbufen,</b> flurbiprofen (R/S), ketoprofen (R/S), paracetamol, piracetam, and salicylic acid) {{as part of a}} larger systematic study of synthon stability. From the screen, three new co-crystal systems have been identified (ibuprofen (R/S and S) and salicylic acid) and their crystal structures determined. Because of poor crystal growth synchrotron radiation was required for structure solution of the S-ibuprofen nicotinamide co-crystal. Two further potential systems have also been discovered (<b>fenbufen</b> and flurbiprofen), but crystals suitable for structure determination have yet to be obtained.

Analysis of the binding of [123 I]IOFA to COX- 1 and COX- 2 enzymes by using HPLC and a gel filtration column showed a selectivity ratio of 1 : 1. 3. An assay for the competitive inhibition of substrate transfer showed that IOFA exhibited a comparable IC 50 value compared to <b>fenbufen.</b> In the normal rat liver, a lower level and homogeneous pattern of [123 I]IOFA radioactivity was observed by SPECT.

40|$|Rare {{side effects}} on {{the central nervous system}} {{including}} dizziness, restlessness, and even very rare convulsions as reported during the course of antibiotic treatment with quinolones were the topic of a well-controlled in vitro approach. The excitability of brain matter was tested by electrically evoking field potentials in the CA 1 region of the rat hippocampus in vitro. Direct effects of nalidixic acid, enoxacin, pefloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin were found to occur as a dose-dependent increase in amplitude of this field potential, which is in line with the view that the quinolones increase excitability. The highest increase was found with enoxacin and nalidixic acid, and the lowest increase was found with ciprofloxacin. In order to keep the potential risk of the antibiotic therapy as low as possible, ciprofloxacin might be the drug of choice of the quinolones. In contrast to the quinolones, which only increased the amplitudes of electrically evoked potentials, <b>fenbufen</b> induced spontaneous firing in the pyramidal cell layer without stimulation in addition to its dose-dependent {{effects on the}} amplitudes of the evoked potentials. Threshold doses of the quinolones tested (0. 25 microM) increased the amplitudes of evoked potentials in the presence of an otherwise ineffective concentration of <b>fenbufen</b> (1 microM) to different degrees, ranging from 39. 2 % for ciprofloxacin to 72. 6 % for enoxacin...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacodynamic}} and phannacokinetic {{drug interactions}} and pharmaceutical compatibilities of fluoroquinolones are reviewed. Incompatibilities are observed between quinolones and penicillins such as fluclox-acillin and amoxicillin and with clindamycin when mixed in an administration set. Fluoroquinolones, especially cnoxacin, {{and to a}} lesser extent ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin, inhibit the metabolic clearance of theophyllinc and caffeine. It is advis-able to use non-interacting quinolones such as ofloxacin or norfloxacin or to measure theophylline levels and reduce caffeine intake where appropriate. A potential interaction with midazolam needs further study. The absorption of fluoroquinolones is markedly reduced by antacids, calcium carbonate, ferrous sulphate and sucralfate. Although quantitative differences between fluoroquinolones exist, these combinations should be avoided whenever possible. Cimetidine reduces the metabolic clearance of pefloxacin. More studies are needed on the possible reduction of absorption of fluoroquinolones by opiates. Several case reports of a pharmacodynamic interaction between fluoroquinolones and cyclosporin or oral anticoagulants exist. No pharmacokinetic interaction has been observed and more, controlled studies are needed to assess the significance of the pharmacodynamic interaction. A high incidence of convulsions has been observed in patients receiving the combination enoxacin and <b>fenbufen,</b> an NSAID. A synergistic inhibitory effect of fluoroquinolones and several NSAIDs has been observed on the binding of the neurotransmitter GABA.

40|$|The {{combination}} of some new quinolone antibacterial agents with 4 -biphenylacetic acid (BPAA), a metabolite of <b>fenbufen,</b> {{is known to}} specifically induce functional blockade of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors. The mechanisms of these drug interactions were further examined. Scatchard analysis of [3 H]muscimol binding to rat brain plasma membranes {{in the presence of}} enoxacin and BPAA revealed that a significant {{decrease in the number of}} muscimol binding sites was produced without affecting the affinity of binding to the receptors. In the presence of norfloxacin, BPAA inhibited muscimol binding the most potently of the six BPAA-related compounds tested. <b>Fenbufen</b> and 9, 10 -dihydro-gamma-oxo- 2 -phenanthrenebutyric acid also inhibited the binding, and 4 -biphenylcarboxylic acid and methyl 4 -biphenylacetate inhibited it slightly, but 3 -benzoylpropionic acid exhibited no competitive inhibition. Accordingly, hybrid molecules of norfloxacin and BPAA were synthesized for stereochemical analysis of these drug interactions. A hybrid with a -CONH(CH 2) 3 - chain between norfloxacin and BPAA (flexible structure) inhibited muscimol binding, and intracisternal injection of this hybrid caused clonic convulsions in mice more potently than the {{combination of}} norfloxacin and BPAA did. In contrast, a hybrid linked by -CONH- (stretched structure) showed almost no such inhibitory effect. 1 H NMR analysis indicated the presence of intramolecular attraction at the quinoline ring of the hybrid exhibiting the antagonistic activity. These results suggest the possibility that quinolones and BPAA interact with the GABA receptor at nearby sites and that the binding affinity of quinolones to the GABA receptors is largely enhanced by the intermolecular interaction with BPAA...|$|E

Results {{were compared to}} those obtained at low RH (22 %), published in a previous paper. The water uptake percentage of binary mixtures were intermediate between that of pure PVP and pure drugs. By X-ray powder diffraction, for all the drugs, {{it was possible to}} note a marked decrease in crystallinity degree, in particular at highest RH%.

Although the in vivo pro-convulsant activity of NSAIDS is essentially unknown, the convulsant potential of FQs is traditionally evaluated by in vitro γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding experiments in the presence of 4 -biphenyl acetic acid (BPAA), the active metabolite of <b>fenbufen.</b> The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the BPAA-norfloxacin convulsant interaction in vivo. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n= 27) were given BPAA orally, at various doses 1 [*]h before norfloxacin infusion, which was maintained until the onset of maximal seizures, when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma samples were collected for analysis. An inhibitory Emax effect model with a baseline effect parameter was fitted to the norfloxacin versus BPAA concentrations in the CSF, previously shown {{to be part of the}} biophase. This model includes three parameters: the concentrations of norfloxacin in the absence of BPAA (CCSF 0, Nor), and when BPAA concentration tends toward infinity (CCSFbase, Nor), and the BPAA concentration for which half of the maximal effect is observed (CCSF 50, BPAA). The maximal proconvulsant effect of BPAA is given by the CCSF 0, Nor / CCSFbase, Nor ratio, estimated to approximately 6 in this study. Derived models were developed in plasma to account for the non-linear CSF diffusion of norfloxacin and protein binding of BPAA. In conclusion this study has shown that the convulsant interaction between norfloxacin and BPAA in rats, can be adequately characterized by modelling of the CSF concentrations of the two drugs at the onset of activity, following their administration in various proportions...|$|E
40|$|Fluoroquinolones are {{antibiotics}} {{with central}} excitatory side effects. These adverse effects presumably result from inhibition of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) binding to GABAA receptors. This GABA antagonistic effect is greatly potentiated by the active metabolite of <b>fenbufen,</b> biphenylacetic acid (BPAA). Nevertheless, it remains questionable whether GABA receptor antagonism alone {{can explain the}} convulsant activity potentials of these antimicrobial agents. The present study was undertaken to investigate the possible effects of norfloxacin, both in the absence and {{in the presence of}} BPAA, on the extracellular hippocampal levels of GABA and glutamate, the main central inhibitory and excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters, respectively. This in vivo microdialysis approach with conscious rats allows monitoring of behavioral alterations and concomitant transmitter modulation in the hippocampus. Peroral administration of 100 mg of BPAA per kg of body weight had no effect on behavior and did not significantly alter extracellular GABA or glutamate concentrations. Intravenous perfusion of 300 mg of norfloxacin per kg did not change the rat's behavior or the concomitant neurotransmitter levels in about half of the experiments, while the remaining animals exhibited severe seizures. These norfloxacin-induced convulsions did not affect extracellular hippocampal GABA levels but were accompanied by enhanced glutamate concentrations. Half of the rats receiving both 100 mg of BPAA per kg and 50 mg of norfloxacin per kg displayed lethal seizures, while the remaining animals showed no seizure-related behavior. In the latter subgroup, again no significant alterations in extracellular GABA levels were observed, but glutamate overflow remained significantly elevated for at least 3 h. In conclusion, norfloxacin exerts convulsant activity in rats, accompanied by elevations of extracellular hippocampal glutamate levels but not GABA levels, even in the presence of BPAA...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between the chemical structure and epileptogenic activity of quinolones was investigated. When the quinolones were administered intravenously to mice concomitantly with oral biphenylacetic acid, a major metabolite of the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug <b>fenbufen,</b> enoxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and pipemidic acid, which have an unsubstituted piperazine moiety at the 7 position of their parent nuclei, provoked clonic convulsions and subsequent death at doses of 6. 25 mg/kg or more in a dose-dependent manner. AM- 1091 and T- 3262, which have an unsubstituted aminopyrrolidine moiety at their 7 positions, were less epileptogenic than the compounds listed above were. In contrast, ofloxacin, AT- 4140, and nalidixic acid, which have piperazine substituted with methyl group(s) or no piperazine moiety at their 7 positions, never induced convulsions, even at doses of 100 mg/kg. Lomefloxacin, which has a 3 -methyl piperazine, however, provoked convulsions at doses of 6. 25 mg/kg or more. In the presence of biphenylacetic acid, all the test quinolones except nalidixic acid competitively inhibited [3 H]muscimol binding to receptor sites for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vitro. Nalidixic acid did not inhibit the binding at all, even at the highest concentration tested, i. e., 10 (- 4) M. The 50 % inhibition doses for [3 H]muscimol binding varied within 4 orders of magnitude or more, between 10 (- 8) to more than 10 (- 4) M for various compounds, {{and there was a}} close correlation between the epileptogenic activities of quinolones and their inhibitory potencies for [3 H]muscimol binding to GABA receptor sites. These results indicate that the epileptogenic activity of quinolones possibly relates to the GABA-like structures of substituents at their 7 positions, which act as antagonists of GABA receptors...|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} and reactivity of excited states and free radicals from primaquine was studied {{in order to}} evaluate the primary photochemical reaction mechanisms. The excited primaquine triplet was not detected, but {{is likely to be}} formed with a short lifetime (< 50 ns) and with a triplet energy < 250 kJ/mol as the drug is an efficient quencher of the <b>fenbufen</b> triplet and the biphenyl triplet, and forms 1 O 2 by laser flash photolysis (PQ ΦΔ = 0. 025). Primaquine photoionises by a biphotonic process and also forms the monoprotonated cation radical (PQH 2 + •) by one electron oxidation by OH • (kq = 6. 6 • 10 9 M- 1 s- 1) and Br 2 •- (kq = 4. 7 • 10 9 M- 1 s- 1) at physiological pH, detected as a long-lived transient decaying essentially by a second order process (k 2 = 7. 4 • 10 8 M- 1 s- 1). PQH 2 + • is scavenged by O 2, although at a limited rate (kq = 1. 0 • 10 6 M- 1 s- 1). The reduction potential (E°) of PQH 2 + • / PQH + is < + 1015 mV. Primaquine also forms PQH 2 + • at pH 2. 4, by one electron oxidation by Br 2 •- and proton loss (kq = 2. 7 • 10 9 M- 1 s- 1). The non-protonated cation radical (PQ + •) is formed during one electron oxidation with Br 2 •- at alkaline conditions (kq = 4. 2 • 10 9 M- 1 s- 1 at pH 10. 8). The estimated pKa-value of PQH 2 + • / PQ + • is pKa ~ 7 - 8. Primaquine is not a scavenger of O 2 •- at physiological pH. Thu...|$|E
40|$|Although ulcers {{are often}} {{associated}} with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{little is known about}} the feasibility of predicting their development in patients taking NSAIDs. In addition, the ulcerogenic potentials of the newer NSAIDs, taken on long term basis, have not been compared with those of more established preparations. The aim of this study was to identify the clinical and pathological characteristics of patients at a higher risk of NSAID induced ulcers, measure the ulcerogenic potential of a variety of NSAIDs, and test the effect of these potentials on the predictability of ulceration. Altogether 190 long term NSAID users were studied. The presence of abdominal complaints, previous history of ulcers, arthritis related physical disability, anaemia, gastritis, and Helicobacter pylori status were all assessed as possible risk factors. NSAIDs were classified into established drugs (group I), and newer agents (group II). Group I included naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, ketoprofen, piroxicam, and flurbiprofen. Group II included <b>fenbufen,</b> nabumetone, ibuprofen, etodolac, azapropazone, and tiaprofenic acid. Of 63 ulcers identified in the study group, 51 (81 %) were seen in group I NSAID patients (51 of 132, 39 %) compared with 12 ulcers in group II (12 of 58, 21 %), p < 0. 02; estimated relative risk (ERR) : 2. 41). In group I, 25 ulcers were found in 38 patients with abdominal pain (25 of 38, 66 %, p < 0. 01, ERR: 5. 03); 18 in 25 (72 %) patients with a previous history of ulcers (p < 0. 001, ERR: 5. 77), 26 in 44 (59 %) patients with debilitating arthritis (p < 0. 001, ERR 3. 64), and 35 in 73 (48 %) patients with H pylori associated gastritis (p < 0. 01, ERR: 2. 48). The presence of these factors in group II patients did not influence the risk of ulceration. Group I NSAIDs were more likely to be associated with chemical gastritis and to intensify H pylori related damage. Although silent ulcers are not uncommon in patients taking NSAIDs, recognition of the risk factors might helps predict a significant number (up to 81 %), especially in those receiving group I NSAIDs...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of dementia. The {{incidence}} of AD rises exponentially with age and its prevalence will increase significantly worldwide in the next few decades. Inflammatory processes have been suspected in the pathogenesis of the disease. OBJECTIVES To review the efficacy and side effects of aspirin, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of AD, compared to placebo. SEARCH METHODS We searched ALOIS: the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register on 12 April 2011 using the terms: aspirin OR "cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor" OR aceclofenac OR acemetacin OR betamethasone OR celecoxib OR cortisone OR deflazacort OR dexamethasone OR dexibruprofen OR dexketoprofen OR diclofenac sodium OR diflunisal OR diflusinal OR etodolac OR etoricoxib OR <b>fenbufen</b> OR fenoprofen OR flurbiprofen OR hydrocortisone OR ibuprofen OR indometacin OR indomethacin OR ketoprofen OR lumiracoxib OR mefenamic OR meloxicam OR methylprednisolone OR nabumetone OR naproxen OR nimesulide OR "anti-inflammatory" OR prednisone OR piroxicam OR sulindac OR tenoxicam OR tiaprofenic acid OR triamcinolone OR NSAIDS OR NSAID. ALOIS contains records of clinical trials identified from monthly searches of a number of major healthcare databases (including MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS), numerous trial registries (including national, international and pharmacuetical registries) and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA All randomised controlled trials assessing the efficacy of aspirin, steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in AD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS One author assessed risk of bias of each study and extracted data. A second author verified data selection. MAIN RESULTS Our search identified 604 potentially relevant studies. Of these, 14 studies (15 interventions) were RCTs and met our inclusion criteria. The numbers of participants were 352, 138 and 1745 for aspirin, steroid and NSAIDs groups, respectively. One selected study comprised two separate interventions. Interventions assessed in these studies were grouped into four categories: aspirin (three interventions), steroids (one intervention), traditional NSAIDs (six interventions), and selective cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) inhibitors (five interventions). All studies were evaluated for internal validity using a risk of bias assessment tool. The risk of bias was low for five studies, high for seven studies, and unclear for two studies. There was no significant improvement in cognitive decline for aspirin, steroid, traditional NSAIDs and selective COX- 2 inhibitors. Compared to controls, patients receiving aspirin experienced more bleeding while patients receiving steroid experienced more hyperglycaemia, abnormal lab results and face edema. Patients receiving NSAIDs experienced nausea, vomiting, elevated creatinine, elevated LFT and hypertension. A trend towards higher death rates was observed among patients treated with NSAIDS compared with placebo and this was somewhat higher for selective COX- 2 inhibitors than for traditional NSAIDs. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Based on the studies carried out so far, the efficacy of aspirin, steroid and NSAIDs (traditional NSAIDs and COX- 2 inhibitors) is not proven. Therefore, these drugs cannot be recommended for the treatment of AD...|$|E
