40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the use of}} daylight {{in the design of}} a controlled environment for food production in the Caribbean and other <b>Equatorial</b> <b>climates.</b> An expanding population has put a tremendous burden on the food production industry in these climates. The increasing population in these climates means that existing fertile land is being taken-over for housing and infrastructure. Furthermore, the fishing industry is also a victim of over-fishing due to a need for alternative foods. This design proposes a technological solution to this social problem. Presented is one answer to improve the fishing industry, through a controlled environment for intensive aquaculture production. To improve crop production due to depleting fertile land and flooding, this thesis proposes hydroponic cultures in multi-stories. In addition, the success of this farming complex is dependent on appropriate research by staffed scientists, seeking to continually improve the end products of this facility. Within this ecosystem, far greater yields will be attained than traditional forms of agriculture, and, aquaculture. The challenge here is to present the most economic solution. As a result, the design of this facility is based on a three-level hydroponic (crops growing in a nutrient solution) facility, a fish hatchery, indoor fish ponds, and, research laboratories within the aquaculture and hydroponic facilities. This thesis presents two design solutions :one on land, that {{addresses the}} issues of flooding and a depletion of available fertile land, and one at sea, that addresses a time in which the population has grown {{to such a degree that}} food production at sea becomes an economic reality. There are many ways to introduce natural daylight into this proposed farming complex. Intensive research has indicated that these methods can often range from the very simplistic to the very intricate, as displayed in new emerging technologies such as the Himawari system developed by La Foret Engineering, of Japan. However, the following are techniques that will be applied in this thesis to bring daylight into the buildings of this proposed farming complex : 1. Optical lighting Himawari system); 2. Perimeter lighting; 3. Reflective lighting; 4. Top/Core lighting. Research has indicated that even during the rainy season (July to December) - in some of these <b>equatorial</b> <b>climates</b> there is adequate available diffused sunlight to reach the crops and aquatic life within this proposed controlled environment. This thesis also addresses the energy and cooling load requirements that result from the use of daylighting. Once again the most economic design is presented in this case study. However, the resulting economic solution (to meet the cooling loads) that is presented for the proposed site in Trinidad, may not be the most desirable solution for other <b>equatorial</b> <b>climates.</b> Consequently, wind energy, solar energy, co-generation, and traditional electricity, are all analyzed. by Curtis B.

Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant respiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones. Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist <b>equatorial</b> <b>climates</b> cause thousands of deaths each year.
