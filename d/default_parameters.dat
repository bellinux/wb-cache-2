40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that, for a {{range of}} state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the differences in generalisation performance obtained using <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> settings and using parameters tuned via cross-validation can be similar in magnitude to the differences in performance observed between state-of-the-art and uncompetitive learning systems. This means that fair and rigorous evaluation of new learning algorithms requires performance comparison against benchmark methods with best-practice model selection procedures, rather than using <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> settings. We investigate the sensitivity of three key machine learning algorithms (support vector machine, random forest and rotation forest) to their <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> settings, and provide guidance on determining sensible <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> values for implementations of these algorithms. We also conduct an experimental comparison of these three algorithms on 121 classification problems and find that, perhaps surprisingly, rotation forest is significantly more accurate on average than both random forest and a support vector machine...|$|R

30|$|It is {{important}} to highlight that the best parameter settings observed in our experiments were sometimes different from the <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> values suggested in previous work in the HS literature [38, 46] and [41]. The previous experiments supported finding parameter values that are more suitable to the multi-objective test case selection problem.|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new Bayesian network (BN) scoring metric called the Global Uniform (GU) metric. This metric {{is based on a}} particular type of <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> prior. Such priors may be useful when a BN developer is not willing or able to specify domain-specific parameter priors. The GU parameter prior specifies that every prior joint probability distribution P consistent with a BN structure S is considered to be equally likely. Distribution P is consistent with S if P includes just the set of independence relations defined by S. We show that the GU metric addresses some undesirable behavior of the BDeu and K 2 Bayesian network scoring metrics, which also use particular forms of <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> priors. A closed form formula for computing GU for special classes of BNs is derived. Efficiently computing GU for an arbitrary BN remains an open problem. ...|$|R

However, it doesn't take account of the crystal structure nor dynamic composition changes in the material that severely limits its usefulness in some cases.|$|E

40|$|Machine {{learning}} algorithms for {{supervised learning}} are in wide use. An important {{issue in the}} use of these algorithms is how to set the parameters of the algorithm. While the <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> values may be appropriate {{for a wide variety of}} tasks, they are not necessarily optimal for a given task. In this paper, we investigate the use of cross-validation to select parameters for the C 4. 5 decision tree learning algorithm. Experimental results on five datasets show that when cross-validation is applied to selecting an important parameter for C 4. 5, the accuracy of the induced trees on independent test sets is generally higher than the accuracy when using the <b>default</b> <b>parameter</b> value. 1 Introduction Technical Note STAN-CS-TN- 94 - 12 Cross-validation (Weiss & Kulikowski 1991, Bailey & Elkan 1993) is a powerful tool for error estimation which has unfortunately been under-utilized in the machine learning community.

50|$|The {{best known}} BCA {{simulation}} program is TRIM/SRIM (acronym for TRansport of Ions in Matter, {{in more recent}} versions called Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter), {{which is based on}} the ZBL electronic stopping and interatomic potential. It has a very easy-to-use user interface, and has <b>default</b> <b>parameters</b> for all ions in all materials up to an ion energy of 1 GeV, which has made it immensely popular. However, it doesn't take account of the crystal structure, which severely limits its usefulness in many cases. Several BCA programs overcome this difficulty; some fairly well known are MARLOWE, BCCRYS and crystal-TRIM.|$|E
