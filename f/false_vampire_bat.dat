5|$|Some bats prey on vertebrates, such as fish, frogs, lizards, {{birds and}} mammals. The fringe-lipped bat (Trachops cirrhosus,) for example, is {{particularly}} skilled at catching frogs. These bats locate {{large groups of}} frogs by tracking their mating calls, then plucking them {{from the surface of}} the water with their sharp canine teeth. Another example is the greater noctule bat, which can catch birds in flight. Some species, like the greater bulldog bat (Noctilio leporinus) hunt fish. They use echolocation to detect small ripples on the water's surface, swoop down and use specially enlarged claws on their hind feet to grab the fish, then take their prey to a feeding roost and consume it. At least two species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the spectral bat, also known as the American <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat,</b> and the ghost bat of Australia.|$|E

2500|$|Family Megadermatidae: <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> (Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia) ...|$|R
50|$|Megadermatidae, or <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bats,</b> are {{a family}} of bats found from central Africa, eastwards through {{southern}} Asia, and into Australia. They are relatively large bats, ranging from 6.5 cm to 14 cm in head-body length. They have large eyes, very large ears and a prominent nose-leaf. They have a wide membrane between the hind legs, or uropatagium, but no tail. Many species are a drab brown in color, but some are white, bluish-grey or even olive-green, helping to camouflage them against their preferred roosting environments. They are primarily insectivorous, but will also eat {{a wide range of}} small vertebrates.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bats,</b> the yellow-winged bat feeds only on {{insects and}} not small vertebrates. They will feed on both soft- and hard-bodied insects. [...] Bats may feed on termites, scarab beetles, orthopterans, lepidopterans and dipterans. The size of prey ranges from [...] "very small to {{relatively}} large". The yellow-winged bat is a sit-and-wait predator. They perch and listen for prey {{and if it}} flies by, the bat launches their attack. This species, while potentially vulnerable to predation, is very alert. Mambas, bat hawks, night tree vipers and common kestrels may prey on this species.|$|R
500|$|The crag martins may be hunted by fast, agile {{birds of}} prey such as the African hobby or Eurasian hobby that specialise in {{catching}} swallows and martins in flight, and by other falcons such as the peregrine and Taita falcons. Crows may attack migrating Eurasian crag martins, and that species also treats common kestrels, [...] Eurasian sparrowhawks, Eurasian jays and common ravens as predators if they approach the nesting cliffs. The dusky crag martin has been recorded in the diet of the greater <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat,</b> Megaderma lyra.|$|E
5000|$|The greater <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Megaderma lyra) is {{a species}} of bat in the family Megadermatidae, the false vampire bats. It is native to Asia. It {{is also known as}} the Indian <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> or greater false-vampire ...|$|E
50|$|The genus Vampyrum {{contains}} only one species, the spectral bat (Vampyrum spectrum). Some alternate names for this species are the <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat,</b> Linnaeus's <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> and the spectral vampire bat. Confusingly, {{they are not}} related to the Old World family of large carnivorous bats {{to be found in the}} Megadermatidae that are also called false vampires.|$|E
40|$|The low- and {{high-frequency}} {{components of}} a rustling sound, created when prey (freshly killed frog) was jerkily pulled on dry and wet sandy floors and asbestos, were recorded and played back to individual Indian <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> (Megaderma lyra). Megaderma lyra responded with flight toward the speakers and captured dead frogs, that were kept as reward. The spectral peaks were at 8. 6, 7. 1 and 6. 8 kHz for the low-frequency components of the sounds created at the dry, asbestos and wet floors, respectively. The spectral peaks for the high-frequency sounds created on the respective floors were at 36. 8, 27. 2 and 23. 3 kHz. The sound from the dry floor was more intense than that of from the other two substrata. Prey movements that generated sonic or ultrasonic sounds were both sufficient and necessary for the bats to detect and capture prey. The number of successful prey captures was significantly greater for the dry floor sound, especially to its high-frequency components. Bat-responses were low to the wet floor and moderate to the asbestos floor sounds. The bats {{did not respond to}} the sound of unrecorded parts of the tape. Even though the bats flew toward the speakers when the prey generated sounds were played back and captured the dead frogs we cannot rule out the possibility of M. lyra using echolocation to localize prey. However, the study indicates that prey that move on dry sandy floor are more vulnerable to predation by M. lyra...|$|R
40|$|Molecular phylogenies {{challenge}} {{the view that}} bats belong to the superordinal group Archonta, which also includes primates, tree shrews, and flying lemurs. Some molecular studies also challenge microbat monophyly and instead support an alliance between megabats and representative rhinolophoid microbats from the families Rhinolophidae (horseshoe bats, Old World leaf-nosed <b>bats)</b> and Megadermatidae (<b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bats).</b> Another molecular study ostensibly contradicts these results and supports traditional microbat monophyly, inclusive of representative rhinolophoids from the family Nycteridae (slit-faced bats). Resolution of the microbat paraphyly/monophyly issue is essential for reconstructing the temporal sequence and deployment of morphological character state changes associated with flight and echolocation in bats. If microbats are paraphyletic, then laryngeal echolocation either evolved {{more than once in}} different microbats or was lost in megabats after evolving in the ancestor of all living bats. To examine these issues, we used a 7. 1 -kb nuclear data set for nine outgroups and twenty bats, including representatives of all rhinolophoid families. Phylogenetic analyses and statistical tests rejected both Archonta and microbat monophyly. Instead, bats are in the superorder Laurasiatheria and microbats are paraphyletic. Further, the superfamily Rhinolophoidea is polyphyletic. The rhinolophoid families Rhinolophidae and Megadermatidae belong to the suborder Yinpterochiroptera along with rhinopomatids and megabats. The rhinolophoid family Nycteridae belongs to the suborder Yangochiroptera along with vespertilionoids, noctilionoids, and emballonuroids. These results resolve the apparent conflict between previous molecular studies that sampled different rhinolophoid families. An important implication of rhinolophoid polyphyly is independent evolution of key anatomical innovations associated with the nasal-emission of echolocation pulses...|$|R
50|$|The New World leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) {{are found}} {{throughout}} Central and South America, from Mexico to northern Argentina. They are ecologically the most varied and diverse family within the order Chiroptera. Most species are insectivorous, but the phyllostomid bats include within their number true predatory species {{as well as}} frugivores (subfamily Stenodermatinae and Carolliinae). For example, the <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> (Vampyrum spectrum), the largest bat in the Americas, eats vertebrate prey including small dove-sized birds. Members of this family have evolved to use food groups such as fruit, nectar, pollen, insects, frogs, other bats, and small vertebrates, and, {{in the case of}} the <b>vampire</b> <b>bats,</b> even blood.|$|R

50|$|<b>Vampire</b> <b>bats</b> are {{the only}} known mammals whose entire {{nutrition}} relies on blood from mammals or birds. In the family Phyllostomidae and the subfamily Desmodontinae, there are three known species of vampire bats: Desmodus rotundus (common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat),</b> Diphylla ecaudata (hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat),</b> and Diaemus youngi (white-winged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat).</b> Most of the referenced research on infrared sensing in <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> {{has been done on}} the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> because this is the most commonly found species. These bats have developed a specialized system using infrared-sensitive receptors on their nose-leaf to prey on homeothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates. Trigeminal nerve fibers that innervate these IR-sensitive receptors may be involved in detection of infrared thermal radiation emitted by their prey. This may aid bats in locating blood-rich areas on their prey. In addition, neuroanatomical and molecular research has suggested possible similarities of IR-sensing mechanisms between <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> and IR-sensitive snakes. Infrared sensing in <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> has not yet been hypothesized to be image forming, as it was for IR-sensitive snakes. While the literature on IR-sensing in <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> is thin, progress continues to be made in this field to identify how <b>vampire</b> <b>bats</b> can sense and use infrared thermal radiation.|$|R
5|$|<b>Vampire</b> <b>bats</b> are bats whose {{food source}} is blood, a dietary trait called hematophagy. Three bat species feed solely on blood: the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Desmodus rotundus), the hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Diphylla ecaudata), and the white-winged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Diaemus youngi). All three species are {{native to the}} Americas, ranging from Mexico to Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Argentina.|$|R
50|$|The lesser <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Megaderma spasma) is a bat {{found in}} South Asia and Southeast Asia from Sri Lanka and India {{in the west}} to Indonesia and the Philippines in the east. They live in caves and tree hollows. They are insectivorous.|$|E
50|$|Predatory bats such as {{the greater}} <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> are known to prey on barn swallows. Swallows at their {{communal}} roosts attract predators and several falcon species make use of these opportunities. Falcon species confirmed as predators include the peregrine falcon and the African hobby.|$|E
50|$|The lesser <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> has {{yellowish}} veins {{through the}} wing, {{and when the}} wings are spread with light behind, they are given a prominent yellow/orange tinge.

50|$|The common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> (Desmodus rotundus) is a small, leaf-nosed bat {{native to}} the Americas. It {{is one of three}} extant species of <b>vampire</b> <b>bat,</b> the other two being the hairy-legged and the white-winged <b>vampire</b> <b>bats.</b> The common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> mainly feeds on the blood of livestock, {{approaching}} its prey at night while they are sleeping. It uses its razor-sharp teeth to cut open the skin of its hosts and laps up their blood with its long tongue.|$|R
5|$|<b>Vampire</b> <b>bats</b> hunt {{only when}} it is fully dark. Like fruit-eating bats, and unlike insectivorous and {{fish-eating}} bats, they emit only low-energy sound pulses. The common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> feeds mostly on the blood of mammals (occasionally including humans), whereas both the hairy-legged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> and white-winged <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> feed on the blood of birds. Once the common <b>vampire</b> <b>bat</b> locates a host, such as a sleeping mammal, it lands and approaches it on the ground. It then likely uses thermoception to identify a warm spot on the skin to bite. They then create a small incision with their teeth and lap up blood from the wound.|$|R
50|$|Some species even prey on vertebrates. The leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) of Central America and South America, {{and the two}} bulldog bat (Noctilionidae) species feed on fish. At {{least two}} species of bat are known to feed on other bats: the {{spectral}} bat, {{also known as the}} American <b>false</b> <b>vampire</b> <b>bat,</b> and the ghost bat of Australia. One species, the greater noctule bat, catches and eats small birds in the air.|$|E
50|$|The crag martins may be hunted by fast, agile {{birds of}} prey such as the African hobby or Eurasian hobby that specialise in {{catching}} swallows and martins in flight, and by other falcons such as the peregrine and Taita falcons. Crows may attack migrating Eurasian crag martins, and that species also treats common kestrels, Eurasian sparrowhawks, Eurasian jays and common ravens as predators if they approach the nesting cliffs.
