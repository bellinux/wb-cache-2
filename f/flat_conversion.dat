The thesis includes {{a study of}} two different directions in achieving a high nonlinearity in a fibre system, namely holey fibres filled with nonlinear liquids and soft glass, small core microstructured fibres. The challenges arising from the development of liquid-filled structures have made soft glass microstructured fibres the technology of choice for the realisation of highly nonlinear systems Amongst the various soft glasses, commercially available lead-silicate glasses are identified as the material {{for the development of}} highly nonlinear fibres. Small-core, leadsilicate fibres with different designs are considered within this thesis. A solid core holey fibre design as well as two all-solid designs, a multi-ring cladding and a simpler W-index profile, are characterised. The measurements confirm the advantages of the all-solid designs over the holey structures and reveal the possibility to achieve simultaneously a high nonlinear coefficient and a novel dispersion profile in such fibres. Some of the presented fibres are employed in all-optical wavelength conversion schemes based on fourwave-mixing. Numerical simulations and experimental results are combined to study the performance of the fibres and demonstrate their use in wavelength conversion devices. In particular, a lead-silicate W-index profile fibre, showing a high nonlinear coefficient of 820 W− 1 km− 1 with a near zero dispersion profile at telecoms wavelengths, is employed to demonstrate a <b>flat</b> <b>conversion</b> gain in the whole C-band. The same fibre is then employed in FWM-based systems to demonstrate multi-channel wavelength conversion, generation of high repetition rate pulses and all-optical demultiplexing.

30|$|The {{quality and}} {{functionality}} of the perovskite film and the complete device strongly {{depends on the}} deposition technique and processing conditions and steps. Several deposition techniques are currently used for the fabrication of perovskite solar cells, including vapor-assisted solution-processed, vapor deposition, and one-step or two-step solution-processed techniques [17 – 30], while casting and solution-processed methods are prefered. Adopting a proper casting method crucially affects the film coverage, thickness, precursor conversion, structure, and charge mobility and consequently the functionality of the whole device. The deposition approach in the present work {{is based on a}} sequential two-step technique (spin/spin or spin/dip) in a planar architecture. This method has been used in mesoporous structures as well [16, 27 – 29]. The two-step deposition of perovskite layer from its precursors was first proposed by Burschk et al. [27] for preparation of perovskite pigments embedded in mesoporous TiO 2 film. It was found that the two-step sequential deposition allows efficient chemical conversion and a better control over the crystal size and morphology than is possible with single-step co-deposition of the precursors. Sequential deposition of perovskite precursors also prevents accelerated crystallization of perovskite as typically occurs in one-step co-deposition approach, improving reproducibility of the films and the performance of the cell [27]. Burschk and co-workers also reported a different orientation of sequential deposition of lead halide crystals induced by anatase scaffold. However, depositing on a flat surface (as required for planar structure) showed a preferential orientation along the c axis.

40|$|Direct <b>conversion</b> <b>flat</b> panel {{x-ray imaging}} {{detector}} is presently {{one of the}} important tools in medical diagnosis of a patient. It provides an excellent image quality, portability, and dose utilization. Amorphous selenium based direct conversion detector with an active matrix array has been in the focus of researchers for the last two decades and extensive work and improvement have been done on this. There are several parameters of an x-ray imaging detector through which the imaging performance of a detector could be measured. The most important measure is the frequency, f, dependent detective quantum efficiency, DQE(f). In this thesis, we have proposed a parallel cascaded linear system model for calculating DQE(f) by considering the effects of K-fluorescence reabsorption, the range of primary photo electrons, charge carrier trapping, aperture function, noise aliasing, and addition of electronic noise. DQE (Detective Quantum Efficiency) depends significantly on the transport properties (mobility-lifetime product) and the creation of K-fluorescent x-ray photons. The DQE model is applied to fluoroscopic and mammographic detectors and is validated with the recent published experimental data. It has been found that the DQE(f) can be improved by ensuring that the carrier with the higher mobility-lifetime product is drifted towards the pixel electrode, i. e., the bottom electrode of the detector. A simplified zero spatial frequency, DQE(0), is also proposed in this thesis. There exists an optimum detector thickness that maximizes the DQE under charge carrier trapping. Although the model is applied to Amorphous Selenium (a-Se) and Mercuric Iodide (HgI 2) based imaging detectors, it can also be applied to analyze the DQE(f) performance of the imaging detectors based on other photoconductive materials like CdZnTe, PbI 2 etc...|$|R

However the a-Se photoconductive layer in FPXIs have to go through high applied field (up to 10 V/µm) and makes one of the significant difficulties related to FPXIs by creating current in the absence of radiation known as dark current. This thesis deals with the effect of dark current under physics based theoretical modeling. The density of the defect states of deposited n layer of multilayer a-Se detectors are determined by analyzing the transient dark current behaviors. This analysis is important for the origin of time and bias dependent dark current being steady state. The improved model {{has been a}}pplied to alkaline doped n-layer and cold- deposited n-i based detectors and validated by the experimental results. This validation strongly supports the physical mechanisms responsible for the transient behaviour of dark current in the X-ray imaging detectors. The theoretical investigation of the density of states (DOS) of both n-layers (alkaline doped and cold deposited) link up the contribution between the trap concentrations and transient behaviour of the dark current. The observation of impact ionization, which leads to avalanche multiplication on the amorphous selenium, has great impact on the low dose medical application such as general radiographic and fluoroscopic applications. However, the dark current can be high and very critical due to extremely high field and the avalanche nature of dark current.

The nonlinearity parameters such as zero-dispersion wavelength (ZDW), chromatic dispersion (CD) and nonlinear coefficient of HNLF has successfully investigated by using several FWM techniques. Results from all techniques have been achieved approximately similar to the manufacturer specification. This technique is then employed for the measurement of the FWM power and FWM efficiency in a SOA, {{in addition to the}} gain performance, which is measured using conventional methods. Based on these parameters, a good agreement between experiments and numerical has been obtained. This characterization is important for nonlinear application such as wavelength conversion, fibre optic parametric amplifier (FOPA) and multiwavelength fibre laser. Wavelength conversion is a key for wavelength division multiplexed (WDM) networks. Wavelength converter based on HNLF and SOA are promising candidates for implementing wavelength conversion. This thesis {{presents a}} thorough investigation of new configurations of the wavelength converter generation by using degenerate case and nondegenerate case of FWM effect in nonlinear media. Most of wavelength conversion configuration used self-constructed dual-wavelength fibre laser as a signal and pump sources due to compact size as well as compatible with current telecommunications system. The dualwavelength fibre laser used in this thesis is more cost effective and inexpensive as compared to the tunable laser sources (TLS). It allows for a smooth wavelength tuning over a wide range and has high performance stability. In the case of a two independent laser sources from TLS, an effective wavelength conversion is achieved by using a lower pump power and signal in HNLF iii | ABSTRACT via the FWM effect. This configuration obtained a higher and <b>flat</b> of <b>conversion</b> efficiency and a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) over 20 nm and can provide an effective means of wavelength conversion for telecommunication applications.

For a number of reasons, the a-Se photoconductor layer in such x-ray detectors has to be operated at very high electric fields (up to 10 Volts per micron) {{and one of the most}} difficult problems related to such applications of a Se is the problem of the dark current (the current in the absence of any radiation) minimization in the photoconductor layer. This PhD work has been devoted to researching the possibilities for dark current minimization in a-Se x-ray photoconductors devices through a systematic study of the charge transport (carrier mobility and carrier lifetimes) and dark currents in single and multilayered a-Se devices as a function of alloying, doping, deposition condition and other fabrication factors. The results of the studies are extensively discussed in the thesis. We have proposed a new technological method for dark current reduction in single and multilayered a-Se based photoconductor for x-ray detector applications. The new technology is based on original experimental findings which demonstrate that both hole transport and the dark currents in a-Se films are a very strong function of the substrate temperature (Tsubstrate) during the film deposition process. We have shown that the new technique reduces the dark currents to approximately the same levels as achievable with the previously existing methods for dark current reduction. However, the new method is simpler to implement, and offers some potential advantages, especially in cases when a very high image resolution (20 cycles/mm) and/or fast pixel readout (more than 30 times per second) are needed. Using the new technology we have fabricated simple single and double (ni-like) photoconductor layers on prototype x-ray image detectors with CCD (Charge Coupled Device) readout circuits. Dark currents in the a-Se photoconductor layer were not a problem for detector operation at all tested electric fields. Compared to the currently available commercial systems for mammography, the prototype detectors have demonstrated an excellent imaging performance, in particular superior spatial resolution (20 cycles/mm).

40|$|Amorphous {{selenium}} (a-Se) and its alloys {{are important}} photoconductor {{materials used in}} direct <b>conversion</b> <b>flat</b> panel digital x-ray detectors. The performance of these detectors is determined, in part, by the electronic transport properties of the a-Se photoconductor layer – namely, the charge carrier mobility m and the deep trapping lifetime t. The product of the mobility and the lifetime mt, {{referred to as the}} charge carrier range, determines the average distance that photo-generated charge will travel before being removed from the transport band by deep localized states in the mobility gap of the semiconductor. The loss of carriers to these deep states reduces the amount of charge collected per unit of x-ray exposure, and, hence, limits the x-ray sensitivity of the detector. Two experimental techniques that may be used to measure the transport properties of holes and electrons in high resistivity semiconductors are described in this thesis. The Time-of-Flight (TOF) transient photoconductivity technique is used to evaluate the charge carrier mobility by measuring the time required for the charge carriers to transit a fixed distance under the influence of an applied electric field. The Interrupted-Field Time-of-Flight (IFTOF) technique is used to determine the charge carrier deep trapping time; the drift of the injected carriers is temporarily interrupted at a position in the sample by removing the applied field. When the field is reapplied the number of charge carriers has decreased due to trapping events. The carrier lifetime is determined from the dependence of the fraction of recovered charge carriers before and after the interruption with the interruption time. TOF and IFTOF measurements were carried out on a number of samples of vacuum deposited selenium alloy x-ray photoconductors. Device quality photoconductor films are fabricated by evaporating a-Se source material that has been alloyed with a small quantitiy of As (~ 0. 3 at. %) and doped with a halogen (typically Cl) in the p. p. m. range. The dependence of the carrier range on the composition of the photoreceptor film was accurately measured using both TOF and IFTOF measurements. It was found that the transport properties of the film could be controlled by suitably adjusting the composition of the alloy. Combined IFTOF and TOF measurements were also performed on several samples {{to examine the effects of}} trapped electrons on the hole transport properties in a-Se films. It was found that drifting holes recombine with the trapped electrons, and that this process could be described by a Langevin recombination process. This finding is important for the correct modeling of amorphous selenium digital x-ray detector designs. Finally, the effects of x-ray exposure on a-Se films were examined. A temporary reduction in the effective hole lifetime was observed due to an increase in the number of hole capture centers following an x-ray exposure. The capture coefficient between free holes and the x-ray induced hole capture centers was measured using combined TOF and IFTOF measurements. It was shown that this capture process was governed by the Langevin recombination mechanism. From these observations it was concluded that trapped electrons from a previous x-ray exposure act as recombination centers for subsequently generated holes, thereby reducing the effective hole lifetime in the sample...|$|R

Probably {{the most important}} feature of SHJ solar cells is a thin intrinsic amorphous silicion (a‑Si:H) layer that is deposited before depositing the doped emitter and back surface field. The passivation properties of such intrinsic layers made by three different chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques have been investigated. For layers deposited at 130 °C, all techniques show a strong reduction in surface recombination velocity (SRV) after annealing. Modelling indicates that dangling bond saturation by atomic hydrogen is the predominant mechanism. We obtain outstanding carrier lifetimes of 10. 3 ms, corresponding to SRVs of 0. 56 cm/s. For a‑Si:H films made at 250 °C, an as-deposited minority carrier lifetime of 2. 0 ms is observed. In contrast to a‑Si:H films fabricated at 130 °C, however, no change in passivation quality upon thermal annealing is observed. These films were fabricated {{for the first time}} using a continuous in-line HWCVD mode. Wafer cleaning before a‑Si:H deposition is a crucial step for c‑Si surface passivation. We tested the influence of an atomic hydrogen treatment before a‑Si:H deposition on the c‑Si surface. The treatments were performed in a new virgin chamber to exclude Si deposition from the chamber walls. Subsequently, we deposited a-Si:H layers onto the c-Si wafers and measured the lifetime for different H treatment times. We found that increasing hydrogen treatment times led to lower effective lifetimes. Modelling of the measured minority carrier lifetime data shows that the decreased passivation quality is caused by an increased defect density at the amorphous-crystalline interface. Furtheremore, the passivation of different a‑Si:H containing layers have been tested. For intrinsic films and intrinsic/n-type stacks, an improvement in passivation up to 255 °C and 270 °C is observed. This improvement is attributed to dangling bond saturation by H, whereas the decrease at higher temperatures is caused by H effusion. For intrinsic/n-type a‑Si:H layer stacks, a record minority carrier lifetime of 13. 3 ms is obtained. In contrast, for intrinsic/p-type a‑Si:H layer stacks, a deterioration in passivation is observed over the whole temperature range, due to the asymmetric Fermi-level dependent defect formation enthalpy in n- and p-type a‑Si:H. Comparing the lifetime values and trends for the different layer stacks to the performance of the corresponding cells, it is observed that the intrinsic/p-layer stack is limiting device performance. Based on these findings, the solar cells were prepared in a modified order, reaching an efficiency of 16. 7 % (VOC = 681 mV), versus 15. 8 % (VOC = 659 mV) in the ‘standard’ order. Finally, transparent conductive oxide (TCO) layers are studied for application into solar cells. It is observed that both types of TCO deposition have no significant influence on the passivation properties of standard a‑Si:H layer stacks forming the emitter structure in the used SHJ cells. On <b>flat</b> wafers, a <b>conversion</b> efficiency of 16. 7 % has been obtained when ITO is used as TCO, versus an efficiency of 16. 3 % for ZnO:Al; slightly lower due to increased electrical losses...|$|R
40|$|The {{innovative}} {{design of}} flat panel volume computed tomography (CT) systems has recently {{led to the}} emergence of a wide spectrum of new applications for both diagnostic and interventional purposes, such as ultra-high resolution bone imaging, image guided interventions, dynamic CT angiography, and interventional neuroradiology. Most of these applications require low X-ray dose to limit potential harm to the patient. One of the main challenges of low dose imaging is to maintain a quantum noise limited system to achieve the highest possible signal to noise ratio (SNR) at a given dose. One potential method to achieve a quantum noise limited system is to employ a high gain detector. Current flat panel CT technology is based on indirect conversion detectors that contain a scintillator and hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) p-i-n photodetectors which have a gain below unity and require a specialized p-layer. In this thesis, an alternative detector to the p-i-n photodetector, which can achieve gain above unity and thus aid in achieving quantum noise limited systems is investigated for large area flat panel imaging. The proposed detector is based on amorphous selenium (a-Se). Amorphous selenium is the most highly developed photoconductor for large area direct conversion X-ray imaging and is still the only commercially available large area direct <b>conversion</b> <b>flat</b> panel X-ray detector. However, the use of a-Se for indirect conversion imaging has not been significantly explored. Amorphous selenium has field dependent mobility and conversion efficiency, which increase with increasing electric field. It is also the only large area compatible avalanche-capable material; a property that was discovered more than 30 years ago. This unique property could be leveraged to provide the gain necessary for low dose medical imaging applications. The only current commercial avalanche capable a-Se optical detector uses electron beam readout in vacuum, which is not large area compatible and makes integration with pixelated readout electronics challenging. The detector structure proposed in this research seeks to address the challenges associated with integration of an avalanche capable a-Se detector with large area X-ray imager. One important aspect in the development of a-Se avalanche detectors is reducing the dark current and preventing a-Se breakdown as the electric field across the device is increased. A high dark current reduces the dynamic range of the detector, it increases the noise level, and it can lead to crystallization of the detector due to joule heating. To overcome the dark current problem, different blocking layers that allow for integration with large area flat panel imagers were investigated. Experimental results from fabricated devices provided the basis for the choice of the most suitable blocking layer. Two device structures are proposed using the selected blocking layer, a vertical structure and a lateral structure, each having associated benefits and drawbacks. It was shown that introducing a polyimide blocking layer brought down the dark current more than four orders of magnitude at high electric fields and does not deteriorate the charge transport properties of the detectors. The polyimide blocking layer also greatly minimizes physical stress related crystallization in a-Se improving reliability. Gain above unity was observed in the vertical structure and the initiation of impact ionization was verified by performing time-of-flight experiments. Although impact ionization was not verified in the lateral structure, this device structure was found to be highly sensitive to ultraviolet light due to the absence of a top contact layer. Devices were fabricated on several different substrates, including a CMOS substrate, to demonstrate their integration compatibility with large area readout electronics. The exhibited performance of the vertical device structure demonstrates that it is a suitable alternative to the p-i-n photodetector for low dose imaging applications...|$|R
40|$|Direct <b>conversion</b> <b>flat</b> panel {{x-ray image}} sensors based on using a {{photoconductor}} with an active matrix array provide excellent images. These image sensors {{are suitable for}} replacing the present day x-ray film/screen cassette to capture an x-ray image electronically, and hence enable a clinical transition to digital radiography. The performance of these sensors depends critically on the selection and design of the photoconductor. This work quantitatively studies the combined effects of the detector geometry (pixel size and detector thickness), operating conditions (x-ray energy and applied electric field) and charge transport properties (e. g., carrier trapping and recombination) of the photoconductor on the detector performance by developing appropriate detector models. In this thesis, the models for calculating the x-ray sensitivity, resolution {{in terms of the}} modulation transfer function (MTF), detective quantum efficiency (DQE), and ghosting of x-ray image detectors have been developed. The modeling works are based on the physics of the individual phenomena and the systematic solution of the fundamental physical equations in the photoconductor layer: (1) semiconductor continuity equation (2) Poisson’s equation (3) trapping rate equations. The general approach of this work is to develop models in normalized coordinates to describe the results of different photoconductive x-ray image detectors. These models are applied to a-Se, polycrystalline HgI_ 2 and polycrystalline CdZnTe photoconductive detectors for diagnostic medical x-ray imaging applications (e,g., mammography, chest radiography and fluoroscopy). The models show a very good agreement with the experimental results. The research presented in this thesis shows that the imaging performances (e. g., sensitivity, MTF, DQE and ghosting) can be improved by insuring that the carrier with higher mobility-lifetime product is drifted towards the pixel electrodes. The carrier schubwegs have to be several times greater, and the absorption depth has to be at least two times smaller than the photoconductor thickness for achieving sufficient sensitivity. Having smaller pixels is advantageous in terms of higher sensitivity by ensuring that the carrier with the higher mobility-lifetime product is drifted towards the pixel electrodes. A model for calculating zero spatial frequency detective quantum efficiency, DQE (0), has been developed by including incomplete charge collection and x-ray interaction depth dependent conversion gain. The DQE(0) analyses of a-Se detectors for fluoroscopic applications show that there is an optimum photoconductor thickness, which maximizes the DQE(0) under a constant voltage operation. The application of DQE(0) model to different potential photoconductive detectors for fluoroscopic applications show that, in addition to high quantum efficiency, both high conversion gain and high charge collection efficiency are required to improve the DQE performance of an x-ray image detector. An analytical expression of MTF due to distributed carrier trapping in the bulk of the photoconductor has been derived using the trapped charge distribution across the photoconductor. Trapping of the carriers that move towards the pixel electrodes degrades the MTF performance, whereas trapping of the other type of carriers improves the sharpness of the x-ray image. The large signal model calculations in this thesis show an upper limit of small signal models of x-ray image detectors. The bimolecular recombination between drifting carriers plays practically no role on charge collection in a-Se detectors up to the total carrier generation rate q 0 of 10 ^ 18 EHPs/m^ 2 -s. The bimolecular recombination has practically no effect on charge collection in a-Se detectors for diagnostic medical x-ray imaging applications. A model for examining the sensitivity fluctuation mechanisms in a-Se detectors has been developed. The comparison of the model with the experimental data reveals that the recombination between trapped and the oppositely charged drifting carriers, electric field dependent charge carrier generation and x-ray induced new deep trap centers are mainly responsible for the sensitivity fluctuation in biased a-Se x-ray detectors. The modeling works in this thesis identify the important factors that limit the detector performance, which can ultimately lead to the reduction of patient exposure/dose consistent with better diagnosis for different diagnostic medical x-ray imaging modalities. The quantitative analyses presented in this thesis show that the detector structure is just as important to the overall performance of the detector as the material properties of the photoconductor itself...|$|R
