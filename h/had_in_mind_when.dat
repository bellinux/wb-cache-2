Before development, the Square Enix staff initially planned to make a PlayStation Portable port of the mobile phone game , but after discussion, they decided {{to create a new}} game. The plot is based on a scenario Kazushige Nojima <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> working on Final Fantasy VII. Crisis Core enjoyed strong sales, selling over three million units worldwide. Critical reception was generally positive.|$|E

500|$|Koen Decoster {{proposes that}} Josephus wrote of [...] "a citadel {{in the lower}} part of the city" [...] to an {{audience}} that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, [...] "a citadel in the lower city" [...] could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> he wrote of the Acra.|$|E
500|$|In the {{conclusion}} of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire," [...] a large prison {{is seen in the}} background hovering over the survivors' temporary settlement. Bear McCreary composed a score for the sequence, which he thought would lay the groundworks for a future theme for the location. [...] "There’s something really powerful there that could become, sort of like a heartbeat-like theme for this location, which is kind of similar to what I <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> I read the comics years ago when I first got there," [...] he asserted. [...] "I had been thinking about it, there’s so many great prison shows and movies and there are certain sounds you kind of associate with it, and I don’t want to do that. But, we’ll see. I mean it really depends on where they take the show. It’s a little early to think about it, but I’m definitely thinking about it anyway." ...|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{emphasize}} winning, Tunis {{believed that}} values like {{hard work and}} perseverance could be taught through sports. The 1951football brochure for the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology Athletic Scholarship committee cites Tunis, saying [...] "The athletic department would like {{to feel that the}} existing program can do for the engineer what John Tunis <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> he said, 'The deep objective of games really is to train one’s reflex of purpose to develop a habit of keeping steadily at something you want until it is done. Many of Tunis' biggest heroes find themselves eventually brought low, like Roy Tucker in The Kid Comes Back, whose wartime service injury may have destroyed his career, or Iron Duke Jim Wellington at Harvard, ostracized and lonely, who perseveres by running track. The real victory is in the character's refusal to give up against long odds. [...] "My heroes are the losers" [...] he once said. [...] "All my books have been in that vein. Every book I've ever written." [...] In the Introduction to The Kid from Tomkinsville, Bruce Brooks writes [...] "for Tunis a win was what happened at the ballpark some of the time, usually just before a loss. It didn't make you a good person, [...] than a loss made you a jerk." ...|$|E

For the recording Culshaw managed to assemble the three singers whom Britten <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> writing the work, uniting Russian, German and English soloists to represent the former enemy nations – Galina Vishnevskaya, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Peter Pears.|$|E

2500|$|Musicologist {{and author}} Julian Budden points to three {{projects}} which the composer <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when,</b> {{at the beginning}} of 1855, he turned down an invitation from La Fenice to write a new opera for them for the following year. [...] He responded: [...] "the chief obstacle is my unshakable determination not to bind myself anymore to a definite period for either the composition or the production". [...] While that approach did not turn out to be practicable at that time, it was an ultimate goal and, in aiming to achieve it, his partner of the previous four years, Giuseppina Strepponi greatly encouraged it when she wrote to him {{at the time of his}} frustrations two years earlier when working in Paris on Les vêpres siciliennes.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, {{the town}} of Chichibu (秩父), Japan, {{under the name of}} [...] "Tokyo Theatre Company", {{produced}} an adaptation of The Mikado in Japanese. Locals believe that Chichibu was the town that Gilbert <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> he named his setting [...] "Titipu", but there is no contemporary evidence for this theory. Although the Hepburn system of transliteration (in which the name of the town appears as [...] "Chichibu") is usually found today, it was very common in the 19th century to use the Kunrei system, in which the name 秩父 appears as [...] "Titibu". Thus it is easy to surmise that [...] "Titibu", found in the London press of 1884, became [...] "Titipu" [...] in the opera. Japanese researchers speculate that Gilbert may have heard of Chichibu silk, an important export in the 19th century. The town's Japanese-language adaptation of The Mikado has been revived several times throughout Japan and, in 2006, the Chichibu Mikado was performed at the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival in England.|$|E
2500|$|In 1796, Lefroy began a flirtation with English novelist Jane Austen, who was {{a friend}} of an older female relative. Jane Austen wrote two letters to her sister Cassandra {{mentioning}} [...] "Tom Lefroy", and some have suggested that it may have been he whom Austen <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> she invented the character of Mr. Darcy in Pride and Prejudice, as the courtship between Tom Lefroy and Jane Austen took place over the year or so that Pride and Prejudice was written. In his 2003 biography, Becoming Jane Austen, Jon Spence suggests that Jane Austen actually used her and Tom LeFroy's personalities as the models for Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, but not in an expected way. Spence suggests that Jane Austen used Tom Lefroy's more gregarious personality as the model for the novel's heroine Elizabeth Bennet, and her own measured demeanor was used as the model for the male protagonist, Mr. Darcy. So while the exact influence of Tom Lefroy on Pride and Prejudice continues to be debated, it does seem certain that his presence in Austen's life is in some way reflected in the novel.|$|E

2500|$|Kodansha (publisher of the Tsubasa and xxxHolic manga) {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} developing both films and contacted Production I.G, who chose Toru Kawaguchi and Tetsuya Nakatake as producers. Since Tsubasa was popular in Japan and Production I.G was well-known, Natakate wanted viewers to enjoy the film. Directed by Itsuro Kawasaki and written by Midori Goto and Junichi Fujisaku, its characters were designed by Yoko Kikuchi and its music composed by Yuki Kajiura. Director Itsuro Kawasaki met producer Nakatake, who told him that they were working in The Princess of the Birdcage Kingdom but had not chosen a director. According to Kawasaki, he had declined an offer from Production I.G because {{he was working on}} an anime television series. It was the director's first feature animated film; Kawasaki was initially sceptical about making a film based on Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, because he thought the market was saturated and wanted to focus on less-popular series. Since he had heard that Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle was an entertaining manga, Kawasaki read it when the film finished development. He was satisfied because it was what he <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> <b>when</b> he made the film, and praised Clamp's illustrations and designs. When Yoko Kikuchi was chosen as character designer, Kawasaki said, [...] "we were very lucky"; he was familiar with Kikuchi's work, and she was fond of the character Sakura.|$|E
