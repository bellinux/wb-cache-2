The regime first secured diplomatic recognition from President François Tombalbaye of neighboring Chad, whom Bokassa met in Bouca, Ouham. After Bokassa reciprocated by meeting Tombalbaye on 2 April 1966 along the southern border of Chad at Fort Archambault, the two decided to help one another if either was in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> power. Soon after, other African countries began to diplomatically recognize the new government. At first, the French government was reluctant to support the Bokassa regime, so Banza went to Paris to meet with French officials {{to convince them that}} the coup was necessary to save the country from turmoil. Bokassa met with Prime Minister Georges Pompidou on 7 July 1966, but the French remained noncommittal in offering their support. After Bokassa threatened to withdraw from the franc monetary zone, French President Charles de Gaulle decided to make an official visit to the Central African Republic on 17 November 1966. To the new government, this visit meant that the French had accepted the new changes in the country.|$|E
5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there is a <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E

The Phillies, {{originally}} scheduled to play in the afternoon of April 6, earned the distinction of playing the opening game of the entire 2009 Major League Baseball season after winning the 2008 World Series. They lost the opener 4–1 to the division-rival Braves, whose new ace, Derek Lowe, pitched eight shutout innings. The Phillies lost the next game, and were in <b>danger</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> the following night and dropping to 0–3 before scoring eight runs {{in the bottom of the}} seventh inning for a 12–11 come-from-behind win.

The Phillies defeated the Washington Nationals in the opener of their third series, just hours after the death of Hall of Fame broadcaster Harry Kalas, but lost the third scheduled game of the series after the second was cancelled due to weather. In their series against the San Diego Padres, the Phillies dropped the first two games as well; during the second game, closer Brad Lidge blew his first save in a Phillies uniform, breaking his streak of 47 consecutive saves extending back to the 2007 regular season.

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} {{some of the}} points of contact between Giddens' theory of self- {{identity}} and late modernity, and the broader constituency of post-modem theories of subjectivity. We take as our focus some recent work by Anthony Giddens, who has set out an account {{of what it means}} to live in 'late modernity'. This account, we argue, resonates with a parallel 'post-modern' account of subjectivity. We express reservations about the way in which both late- and post-modern subjects appear in these theoretical accounts to be disconnected from their 'real' social and political contexts. Similarly, we point to the way in which social action is increasingly seen as having broken free from material and political interests. We point to the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> sight <b>of</b> material conditions and political circumstances in theoretical debates about modernity and post- modernity. Moreover, we set out some broad critical propositions intended to counter this tendency. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{rule of law}} is {{sometimes}} associated with the precision and determinacy of legal rules, and the predictability of the environment that they provide. But it is important also to think about the various ways in which law helps to make us more thoughtful and reflective, governing us through standards and principles rather than through the robotic precision of rules. Whether in private law (with standards of reasonable care), or in human rights law (with norms prohibiting inhuman and degrading treatment), law sometimes invites its subjects to make thoughtful judgments about their behavior or about the situations that they face, structuring and channeling those judgments in various ways. The paper focuses on three ways in which law itself sponsors thoughtfulness and argumentation: (1) first, in its use of standards (as well as rule); (2) secondly in the way legal procedures structure and facilitate argumentation; (3) in the way precedents provide shared premises for argument. It would be a pity if we were to <b>lose</b> sight <b>of</b> these functions of law; and equally it would be a pity to distinguish too sharply between these key features of law and the aide of the rule of law. This paper reflects in general terms on the circumstances in which law 2 ̆ 7 s facilitation of thoughtfulness is appropriate, and on the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> sight <b>of</b> this aspect of the rule of law...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFeng Xiaogang, the 'Chinese Spielberg', {{produces}} huge blockbusters and hilarious comedies {{directed at}} a broad audience. Although his work does not strictly deal with environmental issues, it {{provides us with}} a privileged perspective through which to analyse the discourses around the theme of nature. Feng Xiaogang's works are not explicitly environmental, they do address the contradictions and differing anxieties linked to China's economic and environmental development. For example, A World Without Thieves (Feng Xiaogang, 2004) employs the natural image of Tibetan mountains {{as a symbol of}} search for oneself and introspection, while it symbolically links Tibet to China, setting aside the political troubles that regularly hit the region. Likewise the stunning landscapes in If You are the One 1 & 2 (Feng Xiaogang, 2008 and 2010) sorry don't understand; I mean: If You are the One (2008) and If You are the One 2 (2010) remind us of the importance of nature, rural surroundings, and the absence of human intervention within the changing of seasons, hinting at the same time at the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> such natural richness. Simultaneously these built-up, symbolic images refer to dreams of capitalist possession where nature turns into nothing but a marketing tool, a status symbol, a showcase of wealth and vanity parade. As forms of symbolic power imposed on the collective imagination and symptoms of the ever-growing {{need to be aware of}} the fragility of nature and the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> uncontrolled development, these films bring into play several contradictory discourses that cannot be ignored in the future development of China and Chinese cinema. Like every great producer of popular cinema, Feng Xiaogang produces narratives governed by the public and consumerist doxa, from which potentially subversive apprehensions emerge...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the system of charity and aid in Ferrara in the Napoleonic period. Particular {{attention has been paid}} to the woman’s position and this has been divided into two principal catagories: ‘The Innocent’ and ‘The Fallen’. These titles, unused for almost two centuries, defined for a considerable time, a woman’s status which centred on her honour and the <b>dangers</b> <b>of</b> <b>losing</b> this honour. In the 18 th Century, the value of virginity was very high and was capable, through the dowry system, of changing a woman’s social and economic status which in turn influenced in a very real way the two main opportunities available to her, to marry or to enter a nunnery Female orphans, the poor and homeless represent the most vulnerable social level and those most a risk of resorting to prostitution and begging to survive and consequently losing their honour and becoming ‘the fallen’. This is where purpose made organizations, such as homes for spinsters or assisted accommodation came into play, supplying, after often forcing the ‘patients’ to enter, economic and moral support and protection, often missing or unsuitable in their family lives. During the Napoleonic period in Ferrara two types of aid were present and these have been studied in this theses. The majority of the data originates from manuscripts written during the time of Napoleon, mainly found in the Archives of Ferrara and also in the State Archives and those of the Diocese of Ferrara. These documents have allowed us not only to appreciate the way in which the church managed their administration but also to have a direct account of real life experiences, told by the women who were involved, particularly from the Casa di Santa Maria del Soccorso, which was a shelter for unmarried pregnant women...|$|R
