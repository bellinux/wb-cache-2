50|$|The {{trials in}} 1918 entirely {{dismantled}} the Navy Street gang. Testimonies {{of their own}} associates destroyed the <b>internal</b> <b>protection</b> against law enforcement they once enjoyed. The demise of the gangs meant {{the end of the}} Camorra in New York and the rise in power of their rivals, the American-based Sicilian Mafia groups. Following the downfall of the New York Camorra, Neapolitan or Campanian organized crime groups in New York were absorbed into or merged with the newly dominant Sicilian Mafia groups in New York, creating the modern Italian-American Mafia, which would increasingly consist of not only Sicilians but Italian and Italian-American criminals from various Italian regions. Future Italian-American gangsters that originated from Naples or Campania, like Vito Genovese, operated in Italian-American Mafia families, in which an Italian-American gangster's exact Italian region of origin had little importance {{as long as he was}} of Italian origin.|$|E

50|$|FÚG {{armoured}} scout {{cars were}} serving with armies of six Warsaw Pact countries: Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria, East Germany and Romania. Poland received {{small numbers of}} FÚG armoured scout cars in reconnaissance, command, artillery forward observation post and NBC reconnaissance versions in 1965. Those were probably Czechoslovak OT-65 Otter versions. They were withdrawn from military service in 1980s. After that it was used by <b>internal</b> <b>protection</b> units. No longer {{in any kind of}} service. Three were given to museums. Some were given to the proving grounds as targets after they were stripped of all equipment.Hungary also developed the PSzH-IV armored personnel carrier from the D-944 PSzH armoured scout car. The PSzH-IV prototype first appeared in 1966 and only took part in a single maneuver parade in Bratislava, mounting an egg-shaped turret and dummy automatic cannon. The prototype and the PSzH-IV were first thought to be an armoured scout cars by the West due to its small size and 4x4 configuration, and thus called FÚG-66 and FÚG-70 after the FÚG 4x4 scout car.|$|E
50|$|An {{unprotected}} cruiser was a type {{of naval}} warship in use during the late Victorian or pre-dreadnought era (about 1880 to 1905). The name was meant to distinguish these ships from “protected cruisers” which had become accepted in the 1880s. A protected cruiser did not have side armor on its hull like a battleship or “armored cruiser” but had only a curved armored deck built inside the ship - like an internal turtle shell - which prevented enemy fire penetrating through the ship down into the most critical areas such as machinery, boilers, or ammunition storage. An unprotected cruiser of course lacked even this level of <b>internal</b> <b>protection.</b> The definitions had some gray areas because individual ships could be built with a protective deck that did not cover more than a small area of the ship, or was so thin as to be of little value (the same was true of the side armor on some armored cruisers). An unprotected cruiser was generally cheaper and less effective than a protected cruiser, while a protected cruiser was generally cheaper and less effective than an armored cruiser (with some exceptions in each case).|$|E

External protection was analyzed withRolling Sphere Method and BTS 2 ̆ 7 s height is 40 meters. The efficiency of BTS Arena Remaja is 0, 93 with protection level II and the radius of rolling sphere is 30 meters {{so it could}} be said that the protection chamber such as shelter and generator room are safe from direct lightning. Furthermore, the grounding resistance number from that measurements is around 0, 02 - 0, 07 ohm.

More voltage in the electrical transmission is 7753, 78 kV and in the signal (coaxial cable) minimum 0. 07764 kV and maximum 0. 07909 kV with the fault of current is 36. 16 kA. That voltage will continue flowing to the equipment, so there should be some equipment protection. For an alternative, mounting arresters can be done in stages according to the characteristics.

40|$|Adaptive {{response}} {{is a topic}} of general interest in medical research. Utilization of adaptive response has become a new treatment strategy for some diseases, the core {{of which is to}} stimulate the mechanisms of body <b>internal</b> <b>protection,</b> to improve the adaptive and anti-injury capability, and to maintain the homeostasis of the body. The existence of adaptive response indicates that the body <b>internal</b> <b>protection</b> can be induced and its key mechanism is the inducement of internal protective factors (internal protective proteins). In this article, some connections between adaptive response and the theory of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) were discussed, which indicated that adaptive {{response is}} much beneficial for explaining some theories of TCM such as correspondence between human and nature, strengthening healthy qi to consolidate constitution, acupuncture theory, adaptogen herbs, and treating disease before its onset, etc. Thus the adaptive response is of great significance for explaining scientifically the connotative meaning of the theories of TCM and for promoting the integration of TCM and western medicine...|$|E
