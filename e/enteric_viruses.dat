This study monitored {{for two years}} the enterovirus and Giardia content of reuse effluent from several Arizona wastewater treatment facilities.

Up to 43 % of samples from facilities with primary treatment and oxidation ponds were positive and exceeded 1 <b>enteric</b> <b>virus</b> / 40 L. Also, 27 % of secondary (activated sludge) effluent samples, which were sand filtered and disinfected by ultraviolet light, were positive and exceeded the 1 <b>enteric</b> <b>virus</b> / 40 L standard.

40|$|A crucial {{event in}} the {{pathogenesis}} of systemic <b>enteric</b> <b>virus</b> infections is entry of virus into the nervous system. Whether <b>enteric</b> <b>virus</b> spreads from the intestinal tract to {{the central nervous system}} through nerves or through the bloodstream was examined using a serotype 3 reovirus strain. After peroral inoculation of newborn mice with reovirus, serial histologic sections of small intestine, brain and spinal cord were prepared and stained by immunoperoxidase to detect viral antigen. Three days after inoculation, viral antigen was observed in mononuclear cells of ileal Peyer's patches and in neurons of the adjacent myenteric plexus. Infection first appeared in the central nervous system 1 - 2 days later in neurons of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. Endothelial cells, meninges, choroid plexus, hypothalamus, and area postrema were not infected, indicating neural rather than bloodborne spread from the intestine. Staining of neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve depended on the route of virus inoculation and was independent of the amount of virus in the bloodstream. These results demonstrate that an <b>enteric</b> <b>virus</b> entering a host from the intestinal lumen can spread to the central nervous system through nerve fiber innervating the intestine...|$|R
40|$|Microbiological {{safety of}} {{reclaimed}} water {{is one of}} the most important issues in managing potential health risks related to wastewater recycling. Presence and removal of human adenovirus (HAdV), human polyomavirus (HPyV), human torque teno virus (HTtV) and somatic coliphage family Microviridae in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in sub-tropical Brisbane, Australia was investigated. All three WWTPs employ activated sludge process with added on Bardenpho process for nutrient removal. HPyV, HAdV, HTtV and Microviridae were consistently detected in the influent (10 (5) to 10 (6) Genomic copies (GC) L(- 1)) and secondary treated effluent (10 (2) to 10 (3) GCL(-) (1)). The results of this study suggest that, under appropriate conditions, WWTPs with activated sludge process in sub-tropical climate could be an effective treatment barrier with > 3 log 10 removal of <b>enteric</b> <b>virus.</b> The geometric mean of pooled data for each virus from all sites showed the highest removal for HPyV (3. 65 log 10) and lowest for HAdV (2. 79 log 10) which was statistically significant (p= 0. 00001). Whereas, the removal rate of HTtV and Microviridae was identical (2. 81 log 10). A poor correlation between the presence of <b>enteric</b> <b>virus</b> in influent or effluent with routinely monitored physicochemical parameters suggests limited use of physicochemical parameters as predictors of <b>enteric</b> <b>virus</b> presence. High prevalence of HAdV in influent and effluent combined with comparatively low removal suggest that it could be used as a model microorganism for determining <b>enteric</b> <b>virus</b> removal efficacy. Additional tertiary treatment may be required prior to effluent reuse for non-potable purposes or discharge into the recreational waters to prevent exposure of people to health hazards...|$|R

5000|$|One way {{in which}} {{intestinal}} permeability is modulated is via CXCR3 receptors in cells in the intestinal epithelium, which respond to zonulin. [...] Gliadin (a glycoprotein present in wheat) activates zonulin signaling irrespective of the genetic expression of autoimmunity, leading to increased intestinal permeability to macromolecules. Bacterial pathogens such as cholera, select <b>enteric</b> <b>viruses,</b> and parasites modulate intestinal tight junction structure and function, and these effects {{may contribute to the}} development of chronic intestinal disorders.

5000|$|Viruses are a {{major cause}} of human {{waterborne}} and water-related diseases. Waterborne diseases are caused by water that is contaminated by human and animal urine and feces that contain pathogenic microorganisms. A subject can get infected through contact with or consumption of the contaminated water. Viruses affect all living organisms from single cellular plants, bacteria and animal to the highest forms of plants and animals including human beings. Viruses can interact with their host through several methods and mechanisms; some viruses can be host specific (HIV) and some can be less host specific (influenza) viruses. [...] Different viruses can have different routes of transmission; for example, HIV is directly transferred by contaminated body fluids from an infected host into the tissue or bloodstream of a new host while influenza is airborne and transmitted through inhalation of contaminated air containing viral particles by a new host. <b>Enteric</b> <b>viruses</b> primarily infect the intestinal tract through ingestion of food and water contaminated with viruses of fecal origin.
