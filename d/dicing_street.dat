40|$|Due to {{increased}} technological and economic requirements during wafer production several materials like metal structures or brittle low-k materials are placed within the <b>dicing</b> <b>street.</b> These materials {{have a negative}} effect on the quality and reliability results when using conventional separation methods like mechanical dicing. For this case a laser grooving step, prior mechanical dicing is used to remove these materials out of the <b>dicing</b> <b>street.</b> It is known that each of this separation method creates residual stress in the adjacent material in terms of specific strain fields. In the present study the influence of the strain fields on the mechanical and electrical behavior of chips was investigated. For this reason several laser grooving processes and a mechanical dicing process was compared using a dedicated dicing test chip with sensors to measure the electrical behavior. The mechanical fracture strength of the chips was investigated by 3 -point bending tests. Photoelastic stress measurements were used to characterize resulting strain fields. The more extensive the strain fields, the lower the fracture strength, the greater the number of electrically conspicuous chips. The combination of strain field, electrical and mechanical strength characterization can help to optimize the process parameters get better reliability and quality of chips...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} Thermal Laser Separation (TLS) as a novel dicing {{technology for}} sil-icon carbide (SiC) wafers. Results {{of this work}} will {{play an important role}} in improving the SiC dicing process regarding throughput and edge quality. TLS process parameters were developed for separating 4 H-SiC wafers. Separated SiC dies were analyzed and compared with results pro-duced with current state of the art blade dicing technology. For the first time, fully processed 100 mm 4 H-SiC wafers with a thickness of 450 μm, including epi-layer and back side metal lay-ers, could be separated with feed rates up to 200 mm/s. Besides the vastly improved dicing speed, the TLS separation process results in two important features of the separated SiC devices: First, edges are free of chipping and therefor e of higher quality than the edges produced by blade dicing. Second, the TLS process is kerf free, which allows for reducing the necessary <b>dicing</b> <b>street</b> width and hence increasing the number of devices per wafer...|$|E
40|$|Microelectronic, micromechanical or micro-optical devices (e. g., ICs or MEMS) are {{produced}} {{in large quantities}} on semiconductor substrates. The devices are separated by suitable separation methods and after that further processed and packaged. The separation is carried out by cuts along predetermined dicing streets by which the actual device area is defined. During separation, it may happen that individual devices are not completely separated. In this case, depending on the manufacturing strategy, a rework might be possible, e. g. by a repeated separation step, or the separation can be completed by stressing the <b>dicing</b> <b>street</b> mechanically. This article gives an overview of various separation processes in the semiconductor industry where an incomplete separation may occur. Furthermore, possible mechanical finishing steps are explained which {{can be carried out}} during or after a faulty separation step to ensure a complete separation The procedures are described based on the semiconductor industry, but can also be transferred to other industries (e. g., glass industry) ...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} few years the backend {{assembly}} process has become increasingly complex in order to add more value to products. Two processes that are linked to the changes in assembly are wafer thinning and dicing. Ultra thin stacked die and the implementation of TSVs are driving improvements to the traditional stress relief and fixed abrasive grinding processes. Both CMP (Chemo-Mechanical Polishing) and MCP (Mechano-Chemical Polishing) are being used. Wafer dicing has a number of products and processes behind its evolution. Thin and stacked die with DAF (Die Attach Film) require modifications to existing blade dicing processes. Low-k and copper wafers are requiring the use of lasers to remove materials from the <b>dicing</b> <b>streets.</b> A new and alternative laser dicing process called Stealth Dicing is an enabling technology for a number of products...|$|R
40|$|The {{silicon carbide}} (SiC) market is gaining {{momentum}} hence productivity in device manufacturing {{has to be}} improved. The current transition from 100 mm SiC-wafers to 150 mm SiC-wafers requires novel processes in the front-end {{as well as the}} back-end of SiC-chip production. Dicing of fully processed SiC-wafers is becoming a bottleneck process since current state-of-the-art mechanical blade dicing faces heavy tool wear and achieves low throughput due to low feed rates in the range of only a few mm/s. This paper presents latest results of the novel dicing technology Thermal Laser Separation (TLS) applied for separating SiC-JFETs. We demonstrate {{for the first time that}} TLS is capable of dicing fully processed 4 H-SiC wafers, including back side metal layer stacks, process control monitoring (PCM), and metal structures inside the <b>dicing</b> <b>streets</b> with feed rates up to 200 mm/s. TLS thus paves the way to efficient dicing of 150 mm SiC-wafers. Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|Driven by {{packaging}} {{as well as}} electrical {{performance requirements}} {{there is a clear}} trend to thinner wafers and smaller die sizes. Moreover, as a result of continuing price erosion the need for a reduction of manufacturing costs is obvious. Both can be achieved by making use of A. L. S. I. ’s multiple beam laser dicing technology which is applied successfully in the high volume T&D market segment for already more than 15 years. This technology also gains importance for numerous LED applications. Since the laser tool separates the material without directly introducing mechanical forces even thin wafers can be diced without the typical known issues. Focus sizes below 10 µm as well as the superb dynamic accuracy of A. L. S. I. ’s planar motion system make it possible to decrease the <b>dicing</b> <b>street</b> to less than 30 µm thus leading to a noticeable increase of semiconductor components on a wafer. Additional to this productivity boost the technology overcomes the process capability problems of current mechanical dicing technologies: laser dicing causes no chipping, wafers with thick backside metal-layers can be diced, also there is no quality deterioration due to wear of the sawing blade or diamond tip. Further even brittle III/V materials used for LED and RF-IC applications can be diced at high speed...|$|E
