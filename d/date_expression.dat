To investigate osmoregulation at a molecular level, a 5. 7 -kilobase cDNA homologous to human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (hCFTR) was isolated from a gill cDNA library from SW-adapted killifish.

After abrupt exposure of FW-adapted killifish to SW, kfCFTR expression in the gill increased severalfold, suggesting a role for kfCFTR in salinity adaptation.

To <b>date,</b> <b>expression</b> of Sur 1 in the brains of humans with cerebral infarcts has not been systematically evaluated. We examined Sur 1 expression in postmortem specimens obtained from 13 patients within the first 31 days after focal infarcts, 5 patients with lacunar infarcts, and 6 normal control brains using immunohistochemistry. Elevated immunoreactivity for Sur 1 was detected in all cases of focal infarcts, with 3 distinct temporal patterns of expression: 1) neurons and endothelium showed the greatest elevation during the first week, after which levels declined; 2) astrocytes and microglia/macrophages showed progressive increases during the first 31 days; and 3) neu-trophils near the infarct showed prominent immunoreactivity that did not change over time. Upregulation of Sur 1 was corroborated using in situ hybridization for Abcc 8 mRNA. Sulfonylurea receptor 1 im-munoreactivity in lacunar infarcts was less prominent and more sporadic than in nonlacunar infarcts.

Previous {{studies have shown that}} ABC transport proteins play an important pathophysiological role in several liver diseases. However, to <b>date,</b> <b>expression</b> pattern and possible role of BCRP in human liver diseases and animal models have not been studied in detail. Here we investigated the expression pattern of BCRP in normal liver, chronic parenchymal and biliary human liver diseases, and parallel in different rat models of liver diseases. Expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and additionally by RT-PCR analysis in Thy- 1 -positive rat oval cells. Bile ducts, hepatic progenitor cells, reactive bile ductules, and blood vessel endothelium were immunoreactive for BCRP in normal liver and all types of human liver diseases and in rat models. BCRP was expressed by the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes in normal and diseased human liver, but never in rat liver. Remarkably, there was also expression of BCRP at the basolateral pole of human hepatocytes, and this was most pronounced in chronic biliary diseases. In conclusion, BCRP positivity in the progenitor cells/reactive ductules could contribute to the resistance of these cells to cytotoxic agents and xenotoxins. Basolateral hepatocytic expression in chronic biliary diseases may be an adaptive mechanism to pump bile constituents back into the sinusoidal blood.

40|$|Baculovirus {{expression}} system offers {{the advantage of}} expression of several large proteins simultaneously by a single recombinant virus. To <b>date,</b> <b>expression</b> of multiple large (> 100 kDa) proteins has been hampered {{by the need to}} generate large constructs and repeat use of homologous sequence and promoter. The development of multi-loci baculovirus {{expression system}} overcomes these issues by enabling the recombination of large foreign sequences into different regions of the genome. In this paper, we have examined the co-expression of African horse sickness virus (AHSV) VP 2 proteins from multiple serotypes in a single recombinant baculovirus. To this end, recombinant baculoviruses expressing multiple AHSV VP 2 proteins were generated and it was found that up to six different AHSV serotypes (serotype 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8) VP 2 proteins (∼ 120 kDa) could be expressed simultaneously from different loci of baculovirus genome. The expression of VP 2 of one serotype was not significantly hindered by the presence of other serotypes, although there were slight differences in expression level between different serotypes. The expression of VP 2 of further serotypes from additional loci resulted in a lesser expression level of VP 2 proteins. Based on these findings, three additional recombinant baculoviruses encompassing all nine AHSV serotypes were constructed (serotypes 1, 7, 8 or serotypes 2, 4, 5 or serotypes 3, 6, 9) and each of the triple recombinant viruses exhibited similar expression level of each VP 2.

To <b>date,</b> <b>expression</b> of PD-L 1 is detected in multiple solid tumors, including melanoma, lung, breast, and ovarian cancers, {{as well as}} in myeloma, T cell lymphoma, etc. (Brown et al., 2003; Wherry et al., 2003; Ghebeh et al., 2006; Hamanishi et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2007; Hino et al., 2010). Moreover, PD-L 1 expression can be detected in myeloid DCs, which is induced by factors in the tumor microenvironment (Curiel et al., 2003). The PD-L 1 expression levels on tumor cells tend to be associated with tumor progression and are predictive of unfavorable prognosis and better response to PD- 1 blockade treatment, to a certain extent, in ovarian, kidney, pancreatic, and gastric cancers (Thompson et al., 2005; Wu et al., 2006; Hamanishi et al., 2007; Nomi et al., 2007; Garon et al., 2015; Gandini et al., 2016). PD- 1 expressed by T lymphocytes, particularly tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), can lead to dysfunction of tumor-specific T cells to eliminate tumors (Tumeh et al., 2014). Elevated expression of PD- 1 on CD 4 + T cells in Hodgkin lymphoma negatively affects CD 4 + T cells and is suspected to facilitate immune evasion of the tumor cells (Chemnitz et al., 2007). Elevated expression of PD- 1 is also observed in CD 4 + T cells rather than CD 8 + T cells in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (Shimauchi et al., 2007).|$|E
40|$|Genome {{instability}} {{is a major}} characteristic in {{the development}} of cancer. In many tumours, specific chromosome translocations are involved that activate or abrogate individual gene function. In some cases these changes lead to gene fusions such as in prostate cancer (PCa) where fusions between the androgen-regulated prostate-specific TMPRSS 2 (transmembrane protease, serine 2) and the ETS family transcription factor genes are common. The most frequently occurring fusion is the TMPRSS 2 -ERG (v-ets erythroblastosis virus E 26 oncogene-like) which arises by interstitial deletion of chromosomal DNA or by translocation, with up to 20 different fusions described to <b>date.</b> <b>Expression</b> of the androgen-regulated TMPRSS 2 -ERG fusion has been reported to be present in 40 – 50 % of PCas but its prognostic signifi cance remains unclear. In some cases, expression of TMPRSS 2 -ERG is associated with a worse prognosis whereas in others with a more favourable outcome. This can be explained to some extent by differences in the cohorts studied and sensitivity in detecting the various fusions. In order for the TMPRSS 2 -fusions to be prognostic, it can be assumed that they should be expressed commonly in metastases. To investigate this further we availed ourselves of metastatic PCa samples collected as part of an immunotherapy study. These were lymph node metastases in which tumour had completely replaced the nodes. In this exclusively metastatic epithelial environment TMPRSS 2 -ERG fusion gene expression was observed in 85 % of samples significantly higher than that reported for prostate cancer in general. These data suggest that TMPRSS 2 -ERG expression may be an important prognostic marker in PCa metastases...|$|E

40|$|Retinitis pigmentosa (RP), the {{hereditary}} {{degenerative disease}} of the photoreceptor neurons of the retina, probably represents the most prevalent cause of registered blindness amongst those of working age in developed countries. Mutations within the gene encoding inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase 1 (IMPDH 1), the widely expressed rate-limiting enzyme of the de novo pathway of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, have recently been shown to cause the RP 10 form of autosomal dominant RP. We examined the expression of IMPDH 1, IMPDH 2 and HPRT transcripts, encoding enzymes of the de novo and salvage pathways of guanine nucleotide biosynthesis, respectively, in retinal sections of mice, the data indicating {{that the bulk of}} GTP within photoreceptors is generated by IMPDH 1. Impdh 1 (-/-) null mice are shown here to display a slowly progressive form of retinal degeneration in which visual transduction, analysed by electroretinographic wave functions, becomes gradually compromised, although at 12 months of age most photoreceptors remain structurally intact. In contrast, the human form of RP caused by mutations within the IMPDH 1 gene is a severe autosomal dominant degenerative retinopathy in those families that have been examined to <b>date.</b> <b>Expression</b> of mutant IMPDH 1 proteins in bacterial and mammalian cells, together with computational simulations, indicate that protein misfolding and aggregation, rather than reduced IMPDH 1 enzyme activity, is the likely cause of the severe phenotype experienced by human subjects. Taken together, these findings suggest that RP 10 may represent an attractive target for therapeutic intervention, based upon a strategy combining simultaneous suppression of transcripts from normal and mutant IMPDH 1 alleles with supplementation of GTP within retinal tissues. ...|$|E

A page is judged to be a blog if and only if a sequence of entries that are articles for a day can be extracted from the page. The entries should satisfy the following constraints: 1. Entries should contain a <b>date</b> <b>expression,</b> and it should {{be at the top of}} the entry. 2. The date expressions of the sequence of entries should be consistently formatted 8, and be arranged in ascending/descending order. 3. The tag sequence should be uniform for all the entries in the sequence. The ‘Monitoring ’ module tries to periodically watch the blog pages that the judgment module selected, and extract the updated entries in the pages. The process of blog judgment is as follows. First, we automatically extract date expressions in web pages and annotate them with 〈date 〉 and 〈/date 〉 tags, by using the manually written regular expressions. If the date expressions lack year and/or month information, we try to supplement them by using heuristics, such as the nearest year(month) that appears before the expression. Next, the sequence of entries for a day is tried to be extracted from a page.

We know little about the proteins secreted from the two glands that mediate these biological processes. We have used subtractive RNA-Seq to characterise the complement of genes that are differentially expressed in a head preparation, compared to matched tissues from worm tails. The expression site of representative highlighted genes was then validated using whole munt in situ hybridisation (WISH). Mapping of transcript reads to the S. mansoni genome assembly using Cufflinks identified ~ 90 genes that were differentially expressed >fourfold in the head preparation; ~ 50 novel transcripts were also identified by de novo assembly using Trinity. The largest subset (27) of secreted proteins was encoded by microexon genes (MEGs), the most intense focus identified to <b>date.</b> <b>Expression</b> of three (MEGs 12, 16, 17) was confirmed in the anterior gland and five (MEGs 8. 1, 9, 11, 15 and 22) in the posterior gland.
