25|$|It is {{necessary}} to know that Bourguiba always worshipped his mother, who died prematurely, according to the chief of state, in 1913. In several of his speeches, memory of her returned and the exhaustion born of the <b>double</b> <b>function</b> of the spouse and the mother contributed to his denunciation of the feminine condition in traditional Tunisian society. Although his declaration can be considered sincere—other expositions indeed demonstrate a certain hostility to the period's domestic tradition—it is to be recalled that his mother's memory played no fundamental role in his political positions concerning the feminine condition during the French protectorate.|$|E

2500|$|The Neorion was {{the first}} harbour to be erected in Constantinople after its foundation, and the second in the area after the Prosphorion harbour, which existed already under the city's {{previous}} incarnation as Byzantium, and lay in the next inlet to the east, right under the northwest slope of the first hill of the city, in the quarter named [...] "ta Eugeniou" [...] (...) [...] Being placed on the southern shore of the Golden Horn, the Neorion was not subjected to the heavy storms provoked by the Lodos, the south-west wind blowing from the Marmara Sea; in addition, harbour silting was not such a big problem as for the harbours on the city's southern shore. In fact, entrance of sail ships into the Golden Horn was possible with all winds; the only wind which could create some problems and a light silting being the North wind. The harbour had the <b>double</b> <b>function</b> of commercial port and shipyard, and hosted also a factory producing oars (...) [...] Since the main activity of the harbour was trade, the area was surrounded by many storehouses. This fact is underlined by the many fires which ravaged the port quarter: in 433 all the storehouses burned; in 465 a fire started here engulfed eight regions of the city; and in 559 the warehouses burned again. [...] According to a late tradition, St. Andrew the Apostle settled here and made the quarter the centre of his preaching when he landed in Byzantium. In 697 Emperor Leontios (r. 695-98) had the harbour [...] cleaned from the mud, since the area was suspected to be a plague breeding ground.|$|E
60|$|Most of the maxims {{of justice}} current in the world, and {{commonly}} appealed to in its transactions, are simply instrumental to carrying into effect {{the principles of}} justice which we have now spoken of. That a person is only responsible for {{what he has done}} voluntarily, or could voluntarily have avoided; that it is unjust to condemn any person unheard; that the punishment ought to be proportioned to the offence, and the like, are maxims intended to prevent the just principle of evil for evil from being perverted to the infliction of evil without that justification. The greater part of these common maxims have come into use from the practice of courts of justice, which have been naturally led to a more complete recognition and elaboration than was likely to suggest itself to others, of the rules necessary to enable them to fulfil their <b>double</b> <b>function,</b> of inflicting punishment when due, and of awarding to each person his right.|$|E
