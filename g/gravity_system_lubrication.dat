40|$|Abstract − It is not {{too much}} to say that, at the {{beginning}} of engine development, the most important areas for a good engine concept design is the <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> design. So, between right after finishing concept design and before procuring the engine, it is necessary to carry out the <b>system</b> <b>lubrication</b> analysis for the initially designed <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> and the related lubricating parts. Therefore, in this paper, it is to describe the results of a design review carried out the numerical net work analysis on the engine bearings and the <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> of an initially designed 2. 0 L DOHC engine...|$|R

50|$|On steam locomotives, access {{would be}} {{impossible}} during running, so in some cases centralised mechanical lubricators were used. These devices comprised a large oil tank with a multiple-outlet pump which fed the engine's bearings through a pipe <b>system.</b> <b>Lubrication</b> of the engine's internal valves was done by adding oil to the steam supply, using a displacement lubricator.|$|R

50|$|Lincoln Industrial Corporation (Lincoln) is a {{manufacturer}} of automated <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems,</b> manual <b>lubrication</b> equipment and industrial pumping systems, and subsidiary of Svenska Kullagerfabriken AB (SKF).

40|$|Flooded oil <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems</b> are {{commonly}} utilized for many manufacturing processes. However, {{there is an}} increasing concern with the flooded <b>lubrication</b> <b>systems</b> due to their biological and envi-ronmental impact {{as well as their}} maintenance and disposal cost. Polymer-based material, a sponge-like solid lubricant allowing the oil to weep out while in use, provides a promising alternative environ-mentally benign lubrication solution to satisfy the lubrication requirements for some manufacturing processes. In addition, it can minimize contamination of the coolant system, reduce waste processing and disposal costs, and alleviate the in-plant safety hazard from oil leakage on floor surfaces. The goal {{of this study is to}} develop and improve the current <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> by applying a poly-mer-based near-dry <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> in order to replace the oil flooded transfer line lubrication sys-tems currently in production use. Using a laboratory reciprocating bench test based on the design of experiments, this study characterized the tribological performance of the polymer-based <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> under a variety of operating conditions, identified the main factor that impacts the tribologi-cal performance of the polymer-based <b>lubrication</b> <b>system,</b> and developed a model to predict the wear loss of the polymer-based lubricant plate.

40|$|We {{show that}} analog <b>gravity</b> <b>systems</b> exist for charged, planar black holes in {{asymptotic}} Anti-de Sitter space. These black holes have been employed to describe, via the gauge-gravity duality, strongly coupled condensed matter systems on {{the boundary of}} AdS-space. The analog <b>gravity</b> <b>system</b> is a different condensed matter system that, in a suitable limit, describes the same bulk physics as the theory on the AdS boundary. This combination of the gauge-gravity duality and analog gravity therefore suggests a duality between different condensed matter systems. Comment: replaced with published versio...|$|R

Using the expected duality between a higher-derivative <b>gravity</b> <b>system</b> and N = 2 superconformal field theory in four dimensions, we demonstrate that the resulting Weyl anomaly {{is consistent with the}} field theoretic anomaly...|$|R

5000|$|An {{automatic}} <b>lubrication</b> <b>system</b> (ALS), {{often referred}} to as a centralized <b>lubrication</b> <b>system,</b> is a system that delivers controlled amounts of lubricant to multiple locations on a machine while the machine is operating. Even though these systems are usually fully automated, a system that requires a manual pump or button activation is still identified as a centralized <b>lubrication</b> <b>system.</b> The system can be classified into two different categories that can share {{a lot of the same}} components.|$|R
50|$|In all gliding {{bearings}} wear is {{an issue}} of concern, as well as lubrication. Conventional gliding yaw bearings incorporate gliding elements manufactured out of polymer plastics such as POM or PA. To reduce friction, wear, and avoid stick-slip effects (often present in such high friction slow moving <b>systems),</b> <b>lubrication</b> is often introduced. This solution generally solves the gliding issues, but introduces more components to the systems and increases the general complication (e.g., difficult maintenance procedures for removal of used lubricant). Some wind turbine manufacturers now use self lubricating gliding elements instead of a central <b>lubrication</b> <b>system.</b> These gliding elements are manufactured from low friction materials or composites (e.t.g Teflon) that allow reliable operation of dry (non-lubricated) gliding yaw systems.|$|R
50|$|Effluent sewers also {{currently}} serve {{fewer people}} than septic systems, which also use septic tanks, but simply {{dispose of the}} effluent by draining it into a leach field. About one quarter of United States homes dispose of their wastewater with septic tanks. However, effluent sewers are being looked at as a sewage treatment solution in areas where <b>gravity</b> sewer <b>systems</b> are not well-suited or when the high capital cost to build a <b>gravity</b> <b>system</b> is prohibitive. Areas that are less than ideal for <b>gravity</b> <b>systems</b> include areas that are large, but extremely flat and areas that require long-distance pumping, such as where homes are widely spread out or when several small villages or towns connect their sewage systems so that a centralized plant can be built.|$|R
