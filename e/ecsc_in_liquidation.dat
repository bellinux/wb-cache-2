50|$|The {{signature}} of the Treaty of Rome in March 1957 also {{raised the question of}} the headquarters of the new Communities. The attitude of the Luxembourgish government may be surprising today. It did not immediately demand that all common market and Euratom institutions be located in Luxembourg. It only suggested its capital as a last resort. Instead, it argued for the solution of a split headquarters, which would put the organs of the <b>ECSC</b> <b>in</b> Luxembourg and gave Brussels the new institutions. The government had probably given way to the influence of certain groups who feared the country would be overrun by the European bureaucracy and would lose its identity. It is not clear if it missed a historic opportunity, since in opting for decentralisation, it was better able to defend its status as the location of the <b>ECSC</b> <b>in</b> the face of Brussels's and Strasbourg's candidacies, while obtaining compensation for the loss of parts that were integrated in the new common market.|$|R
