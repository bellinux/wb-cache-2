FE simulation models of a spinning experiment have been developed using the explicit finite element solution method provided by the software Abaqus. The severity of wrinkles is quantified by calculating the standard deviation of the radial coordinates of element nodes {{on the edge of}} the workpiece obtained from the FE models. The results show that the severity of wrinkles tends to increase when increasing the roller <b>feed</b> <b>ratio.</b> A forming limit study for wrinkling has been carried out and shows that there is a <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> limit beyond which the wrinkling failure will take place. Provided that the <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> is kept below this limit, the wrinkling failure can be prevented. It is believed that high compressive tangential stresses in the local forming zone are the causes of the wrinkling failure. Furthermore, the computational performance of the solid and shell elements in simulat-ing the spinning process are examined and the tool forces obtained from wrinkling and wrinkle-free models are compared.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to explore the {{coherence}} of thermodynamic equilibrium predictions with the actual catalytic reaction of CH 4 with N 2 O, particularly at higher CH 4 conversions. For this purpose, key process variables, such as temperature (300 °C– 550 °C) and a molar <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> (N 2 O/CH 4 =[*] 1, 3, and 5), were altered to establish the conditions for maximized H 2 yield. The experimental study was conducted over the Co-ZSM- 5 catalyst in a fixed bed tubular reactor and then compared with the thermodynamic equilibrium compositions, where the equilibrium composition was calculated via total Gibbs free energy minimization method. The results suggest that molar <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> {{plays an important role in}} the overall reaction products distribution. Generally for N 2 O conversions, and irrespective of N 2 O/CH 4 <b>feed</b> <b>ratio,</b> the thermodynamic predictions coincide with experimental data obtained at approximately 475 °C– 550 °C, indicating that the reactions are kinetically limited at lower range of temperatures. For example, theoretical calculations show that the H 2 yield is zero in presence of excess N 2 O (N 2 O/CH 4 =[*] 5). However over a Co-ZSM- 5 catalyst, and with a same molar <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> (N 2 O/CH 4) of 5, the H 2 yield is initially 10 % at 425 °C, while above 450 °C it drops to zero. Furthermore, H 2 yield steadily increases with temperature and with the level of CH 4 conversion for reactions limited by N 2 O concentration in a reactant feed. The maximum attainable (from thermodynamic calculations and at a <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> of N 2 O/CH 4 =[*] 3) H 2 yield at 550 °C is 38 %, whereas at same temperature and over Co-ZSM- 5, the experimentally observed yield is about 19 %. Carbon deposition on Co-ZSM- 5 at lower temperatures and CH 4 conversion (less than 50 %) was also observed.

Genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> conversion <b>ratio</b> {{is known to}} be an efficient way to increase production and increase efficiency in fish farming.

In this study, we investigated the environmental consequences of genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> conversion <b>ratio</b> in an African catfish farm, using Recirculating Aquaculture System (RAS). In RAS, total fish production of the farm is limited by rearing density or by the capacity to treat dissolved nitrogen. To evaluate the environmental consequences of genetic improvement in growth rate and <b>feed</b> conversion <b>ratio,</b> we combined life cycle assessment and bioeconomic modelling of genetic response to selection. We explored different impact categories, such as climate change, eutrophication, acidification and energy use, and we expressed impacts per ton of fish produced.

Genetic improvement of <b>feed</b> conversion <b>ratio</b> reduces environmental impacts in each scenario tested, while improving growth rate reduces environmental impacts only when rearing density limits farm production.

These polymeric materials were characterized by FTIR, 1 HNMR, and GPC. The performance of these additives as pour point depressants and flow improver for Egyptian waxy crude oil was evaluated through measurements of pour point and rheological parameters (viscosity and yield stress). It was observed that stearyl maleate-vinyl acetate copolymer with 1 [*]:[*] 2 <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> shows the best efficiency as pour point depressant even at low concentration while octadecyl maleate-vinyl acetate copolymers with 2 [*]:[*] 1 <b>feed</b> <b>ratio</b> are effective as flow improver...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies were {{conducted}} to investigate the influence of dietary salt on water con-sumption and subsequent carcass lipids in Japanese quail at various ages. In Experiment 1, ran-dombred nongrowth-selected (C) quail were fed 28 % protein diets containing. 0,. 4,. 8, 1. 6, and 3. 2 % added salt. In Experiment 2, growth-selected P- and C-line quail were fed 20 %-protein diets containing. 4 % and 3. 2 % added salt. The different dietary salt levels did not exert a consistent effect on body weight in Experiment 1. There was no adverse effect of salt level on feed consumption and efficiency and no direct effect on abdominal fat or carcass lipid levels. High salt (1. 6 and 3. 2 %) stimulated water consumption and increased water: <b>feed</b> <b>ratios.</b> Water: <b>feed</b> <b>ratios</b> were higher for quail than for broilers, suggesting a species difference. In Experiment 2, C-line quail demonstrated similar effects to the high-salt (3. 2 %) diet in Ex-periment 1. High salt (3. 2 %) adversely affected body weight, feed consumption, abdominal fat, and carcass lipid in P-line quail. There was no affect on feed efficiency, and a substantial stimulation of water consumption with concomitantly increased water: <b>feed</b> <b>ratios.</b> The relatively low abdominal fat observed at 4 weeks of age indicate that nongrowth-selected quail {{may not be a}} good model for the study of abdominal fat in broilers.
