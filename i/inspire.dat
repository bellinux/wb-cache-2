40|$|Biologically <b>inspired</b> {{engineering}} design uses analogies to biological systems to develop solutions for engineering problems. We {{conducted a study}} of biologically <b>inspired</b> design {{in the context of}} an interdisciplinary introductory course on biologically <b>inspired</b> {{engineering design}} in Fall of 2006. The goals of this study were to understand the process of biologically <b>inspired</b> engineering design and to provide insight into biologically <b>inspired</b> design as a type of design activity. This paper provides a descriptive account of biologically <b>inspired</b> design processes and products, and summarizes our main observations: 1) designers use two distinct starting points for biologically <b>inspired</b> design; 2) regular patterns of practice emerge in biologically <b>inspired</b> design; and 3) certain errors occur regularly in the design process...|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, record {{companies}} like Paramount Records and OKeh Records launched {{the field of}} race music, which was mostly blues targeted at African American audiences.

5|$|Einstein {{discovered}} Louis de Broglie's work, {{and supported}} his ideas, which were received skeptically at first.

5|$|The {{process of}} thought behind the Compilation would later <b>inspire</b> the {{creation}} of Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy, a subseries of games linked by a common mythos, and would use {{lessons learned from the}} Compilation production process. On an individual level, Before Crisiss popularity would <b>inspire</b> {{the creation of}} another mobile title within the Fabula Nova Crystallis subseries: originally titled Final Fantasy Agito XIII, it would later change platforms and be renamed Final Fantasy Type-0. The battle sequences in Advent Children also served as inspiration for Motomu Toriyama when creating the battle system for Final Fantasy XIII. Former staff members have blamed the Compilation, in conjunction with other extensions of titles like Final Fantasy X, for undermining the series' market presence and fan trust in the West.|$|E
