40|$|This work {{introduces}} two new lost cost, electronically controlled {{fuel metering}} systems for small gas turbine engines, particularly applicable in remotely piloted vehicles. The first one incorporates a diaphragm operated flat-seat bypass valve {{to maintain a}} constant differential pressure across the metering valve, which is actuated by a digital linear actuator. In the second one, both the metering and the bypass valves are controlled by two independently operated digital linear actuators. The mathematical models for the first fuel metering system, were created and used for computer simulation. Next, after preparing the experimental test set-up, the manufactured prototype was tested and the models for both the steady state and the dynamic response were validated. Three design optimization criteria, fuel <b>flow</b> <b>linearity,</b> low sensitivity to the design parameters changes and fast dynamic response were examined to improve {{the performance of the}} proposed fuel metering system. Finally, a multi-objective optimization technique was developed and implemented to obtain the best design parameters of the system. For the second fuel metering system, first the mathematical models for both the steady state and dynamic response were developed. Next, due to the flexibility offered by this system, different control strategies for controlling the digital linear actuators during the normal operation mode of the actuators and also during the back-up operation modes were introduced and investigated. Finally, to investigate the impact of different control strategies on the dynamic response of the engine, a dynamic model for the engine was also developed and used. At the end, four available fuel metering systems, including the two new ones, were compared regarding their deviation from the fuel <b>flow</b> <b>linearity,</b> dynamic response and the cost...|$|E

Sly* In vitro {{assessment of}} an ultrasonic flowmeter for use in ventilated infants. P. Scalfaro, J. Cotting, P. D. Sly. #ERS Journals Ltd 2000. ABSTRACT: An ultrasonic flowmeter could be advantageous over a differential pressure pneumotachograph having a constant error in varying conditions. The in vitro accuracy of ultrasonic tidal volume (VT) estimates for ventilated infants were evaluated. <b>Flow</b> <b>linearity</b> and frequency response were tested, as was the influence of humidity and oxygen content on the accuracy of VT estimates. The linearity was within the 5 % limits between- 350 and 350 mL. sec- 1 and was not affected {{by the presence of}} an endotracheal tube (ET). The frequency response was flat and unaffected by an ET up to 4. 5 Hz. The VT in the range 7 – 100 mL, in air showed a mean error of 0. 1 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) - 0. 2 – 0. 4 %) with a maximum and minimum of 6. 5 and- 3. 5 % respectively. Humidity did not affect accuracy. After calibration in air, the maximal mean error for measurements in pure oxygen was 3. 0 % (95 % CI 1. 9 – 4. 1 %). Repeated measurements over 5. 5 h had a mean error of 0. 4 % (95 % CI- 0. 7 – 0. 1 %). The in vitro evaluation of an ultrasonic flowmeter showed stable accuracy in mechanical ventilation conditions. Changing connection geometry and oxygen content did not increase the error to a clinically relevant degree. The flowmeter could therefore be a better alternative than the pneumotachograph for ventilated infants...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the efficiency and to monitor the treatment of org. micropollution by advanced oxidn. processes, we have developed a new detection method based {{on the use of}} an electrochem. sensor for alkylphenol detection in water. This sensor, integrating a three-electrode cell configuration, is a com. screen-printed electrode (SPE- 110 GPH) {{that can be used for}} alkylphenol detection continuously by mean of a derived flow cell.

40|$|Abstract- Two of {{the most}} {{important}} static transducer characteristics, in any measurement system, are linearity and accuracy. In the present paper, the calibration and linearization of a low-cost orifice flow meter is considered. Accuracy improvement is based on calibration coefficients that are evaluated with the measurements obtained from a reference <b>flow</b> meter. <b>Linearity</b> improvement is based on a non-linear A/D conversion whose transfer characteristic is the inverse of the transducer’s characteristic. The linearity can be strongly improved using a non-linear A/D conversion performed by a low-cost ADC, using only single-bit input and output ports. The proposed method, already described by the authors in previous papers, is applied to an orifice-based flow meter, simplifying the typical conditioning circuit that requires an additional square root extractor circuit. The paper includes simulation and experimental results that validate theoretical expectations. I...|$|R
40|$|A {{permanent}} magnet probe flowmeter and a Pitot-static bubbler flowmeter are considered for coolant flow measurement in the Fast Test Reactor. The {{permanent magnet}} probe offers a sensitivity {{on the order}} of tenths of a millivolt per foot/second <b>flow</b> velocity, appropriate <b>linearity</b> of response, simplicity of operation, and no contact between liquid metal and electrical insulation. Its applicability is contingent on magnetic material having sufficient magnetization retention in high temperature and high neutron flux environments. The Pitot-static bubbler offers low sensitivity to nuclear radiation, use of off-the-shelf materials, and high, though non-linear, sensitivity. Positive displacement flow in the bubbler may eliminate plugging of the probe tubing by sodium oxide...|$|R

This work presents the flow characteristics of fluid flowing through the conventional and modified ball valves for feasibility of a “linear” ball valve. Theoretical studies are discussed for determining explicit and implicit factors on the valve coefficient, which modulates the flow rate of fluid when the ball valve is operated in flow control processes. In experiment, the cross- sectional opening area at various opening degrees, the shape, {{and the location of}} the hole passage in valve ball are examined for complicated relations dependent to the flow rate of fluid. It can be concluded that those factors cause the modulation of flow rate when the ball is turned at different opening degree. In extended design of <b>flow</b> characteristics for <b>linearity,</b> they are to be taken into account...|$|R
40|$|A dual-phase amperometric {{biosensing}} device, incorporating immobilised tyrosinase, {{has been}} developed {{for the detection of}} phenolic compounds in both the aqueous and organic phases. The all-in-one biosensing probe, in which the electrodes, enzyme and buffer all reside behind a hydrophilic dialysis membrane, allowed direct analysis in the organic phase without the need for deliberately added electrolyte. The design also allowed analyses in both batch and flow injection measurement modes. In aqueous solutions, the unique configuration of the sensing device enabled the direct determination of 1 nM (0. 1 姠l- 1) phenol in batch mode and 10 nM (1 姠l- 1) phenol in <b>flow</b> injection mode. <b>Linearity</b> of response over five orders of magnitude was also achieved. Relative responses for a range of phenolic compounds are also reported. In organic solvents, the sensitivity, linear range and response time were all shown to be very much dependent on the relative hydrophobicity of the solvents and substrates investigated.

40|$|Previously unknown foehn jets {{have been}} {{identified}} {{to the east of}} the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) above the Larsen C Ice Shelf. These jets have major implications for the east coast of the AP, a region of rapid climatic warming and where two large sections of ice shelf have collapsed in recent years. During three foehn events across the AP, leeside warming and drying is seen in new aircraft observations and simulated well by the Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) at ∼ 1. 5 km grid spacing. In case A, weak southwesterly flow and an elevated upwind inversion characterise a highly nonlinear flow regime with upwind flow blocking. In case C strong northwesterly winds characterise a relatively linear case with little upwind flow blocking. Case B resides somewhere between the two in <b>flow</b> regime <b>linearity.</b> The foehn jets – apparent in aircraft observations where available and MetUM simulations of all three cases – are mesoscale features (up to 60 km in width) originating from the mouths of leeside inlets. Through back trajectory analysis they are identified as a type of gap flow. In cases A and B the jets are distinct, being strongly accelerated relative to the background flow, and confined to low levels above the Larsen C Ice Shelf. They resemble the ‘shallow foehn’ of the Alps. Case C resembles a case of ‘deep foehn’, with the jets less distinct. The foehn jets are considerably cooler and moister relative to adjacent regions of calmer foehn air. This is due to a dampened foehn effect in the jet regions: in case A the jets have lower upwind source regions, and in the more linear case C there is less diabatic warming and precipitation along jet trajectories due to the reduced orographic uplift across the mountain passes. ...|$|R
40|$|Catchment streamwater mean {{residence}} time (Tmr) {{is an important}} descriptor of hydrological systems, reflecting their storage and flow pathway properties. Tmr is typically inferred from the composition of stable water isotopes (oxygen- 18 and deuterium) in observed rainfall and discharge. Currently, lumped parameter models based on convolution and sinewave functions are usually used for tracer simulation. These traditional models are based on simplistic assumptions that are often known to be unrealistic, in particular, steady <b>flow</b> conditions, <b>linearity,</b> complete mixing and others. However, {{the effect of these}} assumptions on Tmr estimation is seldom evaluated. In this article, we build a conceptual model that overcomes several assumptions made in traditional mixing models. Using data from the experimental Maimai catchment (New Zealand), we compare a complete-mixing (CM) model, where rainfall water is assumed to mix completely and instantaneously with the total catchment storage, with a partial-mixing (PM) model, where the tracer input is divided between an ‘active’ and a ‘dead’ storage compartment. We show that the inferred distribution of Tmr is strongly dependent on the treatment of mixing processes and flow pathways. The CM model returns estimates of Tmr that are well identifiable and are in general agreement with previous studies of the Maimai catchment. On the other hand, the PM model—motivated by a priori catchment insights—provides Tmr estimates that appear exceedingly large and highly uncertain. This suggests that water isotope composition measurements in rainfall and discharge alone may be insufficient for inferring Tmr. Given our model hypothesis, we also analysed the effect of different controls on Tmr. It was found that Tmr is controlled primarily by the storage properties of the catchment, rather than by the speed of streamflow response. This provides guidance on the type of information necessary to improve Tmr estimation...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of lee-side warming during foehn events is investigated {{as a function}} of cross-barrier <b>flow</b> regime <b>linearity.</b> Two contrasting cases of westerly flow over the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) are considered – one highly nonlinear, the other relatively linear. Westerly flow impinging on the AP provides one of the best natural laboratories in the world for the study of foehn, owing to its maritime setting and the Larsen C Ice Shelf (LCIS) providing an expansive, homogeneous and smooth surface on its east side. Numerical simulations with the Met Office Unified Model (at 1. 5 km grid size) and aircraft observations are utilized. In case A, relatively weak southwesterly cross-Peninsula flow and an elevated upwind inversion dictate a highly nonlinear foehn event, with mountain wave breaking observed. The consequent strongly accelerated downslope flow leads to high-amplitude warming and ice-shelf melt in the immediate lee of the AP. However this foehn warming diminishes rapidly downwind due to upward ascent of the foehn flow via a hydraulic jump. In case C, strong northwesterly winds dictate a relatively linear flow regime. There is no hydraulic jump and strong foehn winds are able to flow at low levels across the entire ice shelf, mechanically mixing the near-surface flow, preventing the development of a strong surface inversion and delivering large fluxes of sensible heat to the ice shelf. Consequently, in case C ice-melt rates are considerably greater over the LCIS as a whole than in case A. Our results imply that although nonlinear foehn events cause intense warming in the immediate lee of mountains, linear foehn events will commonly cause more extensive lee-side warming and, over an ice surface, higher melt rates. This has major implications for the AP, where recent east-coast warming has led to the collapse of two ice shelves immediately north of the LCIS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} an {{algorithm}} for doing high frame rate egomotion estimation. We achieve this {{by using a}} basis flow model, along with a novel inference algorithm, that uses spatio-temporal gradients, foregoing the computation of the slow and noisy optical <b>flow.</b> The inherent <b>linearity</b> in our model allows us to achieve fine grained parallelism. We demonstrate this by running our algorithm on GPUs to achieve egomotion estimation at 120 Hz. Image motion is tightly coupled with the camera egomotion and depth of the scene. Hence, we validate our approach by using the egomotion estimate to compute the depth of a static scene. Our applications are aimed towards autonomous navigation scenarios where, it is required to have a quick estimate {{of the state of}} the vehicle, while freeing up computation time for higher level vision tasks.

40|$|Changes {{in blood}} flow to the inner ear have been thought to {{influence}} or underlie a number of cochlear diseases, including some forms of noise-induced hearing loss, sudden hearing loss, and Meniere's disease. Recently, important advances have been made in two technologies for the study of cochlear blood flow. The first is in the area of vital microscopic studies of cochlear microcirculation, and the second is based on the introduction of laser technology in the form of laser Doppler flowmetry. In this report, measurements are given of changes in cochlear circulation caused by carbon dioxide breathing, intravenous phenylephrine injection, systemic hemodilution, positive end expiratory pressure, and direct electrical stimulation of the cochlea. From these changes, we observe that cochlear blood circulation responds to systemic blood pressure alterations and is subject to local <b>flow</b> control mechanisms. <b>Linearity</b> and speed of response of the laser Doppler instrumentation also are shown. These advances show promise for contributing to our knowledge of control mechanisms of inner ear blood flow and for revealing the influence of various pharmacologic agents of potential clinical value.

40|$|The {{standard}} cosmological model {{implies that}} all celestial bodies are embedded in a perfectly uniform dark energy background, represented by Einstein's cosmological constant, and experience its repulsive antigravity action. Can dark energy have strong dynamical effects on small cosmic scales as well as globally? Continuing our efforts to clarify this question, we focus now on the Virgo Cluster and the flow of expansion around it. We interpret the Hubble diagram, from a new database of velocities and distances of galaxies in the cluster and its environment, using a nonlinear analytical model which incorporates the antigravity force in terms of Newtonian mechanics. The key parameter is the zero-gravity radius, the distance at which gravity and antigravity are in balance. Our conclusions are: 1. The interplay between {{the gravity of the}} cluster and the antigravity of the dark energy background determines the kinematical structure of the system and controls its evolution. 2. The gravity dominates the quasi-stationary bound cluster, while the antigravity controls the Virgocentric flow, bringing order and regularity to the <b>flow,</b> which reaches <b>linearity</b> and the global Hubble rate at distances 15 Mpc. 3. The cluster and the flow form a system similar to the Local Group and its outflow. In the velocity-distance diagram, the cluster-flow structure reproduces the group-flow structure with a scaling factor of about 10; the zero-gravity radius for the cluster system is also 10 times larger. The phase and dynamical similarity of the systems on the scales of 1 - 30 Mpc suggests that a two-component pattern may be universal for groups and clusters: a quasi-stationary bound central component and an expanding outflow around it, due to the nonlinear gravity-antigravity interplay with the dark energy dominating in the flow component.
