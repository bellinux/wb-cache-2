On three separate occasions, in 1861, 1869 and 1889, petitions were brought before the Indiana General Assembly to <b>erect</b> a marker for Jennings's grave, but each attempt failed. In 1892 the state legislature finally granted the petition to <b>erect</b> a monument in his honor. Around the same time, after Jennings's unmarked gravesite was independently verified by three witnesses to his burial, his body was exhumed and reinterred at a new site at the Charlestown cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Using one of {{the above}} definitions, dinosaurs can be {{generally}} described as archosaurs with hind limbs held <b>erect</b> beneath the body. Many prehistoric animal groups are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, pterosaurs, and pelycosaurs (especially Dimetrodon), but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs, and none had the <b>erect</b> hind limb posture characteristic of true dinosaurs. Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.

5|$|Practically {{every imaginable}} posture has been {{suggested}} for Plateosaurus in the scientific literature at some point. Von Huene assumed digitigrade bipedality with <b>erect</b> hind limbs for the animals he excavated at Trossingen, with the backbone held at a steep angle (at least during rapid locomotion). In contrast, Jaekel, the main investigator of the Halberstadt material, initially concluded that the animals walked quadrupedally, like lizards, with a sprawling limb position, plantigrade feet, and laterally undulating the body. Only a year later, Jaekel instead favoured a clumsy, kangaroo-like hopping, {{a change of heart}} for which he was mocked by German zoologist Gustav Tornier, who interpreted the shape of the articulation surfaces in the hip and shoulder as typically reptilian. Fraas, the first excavator of the Trossingen lagerstätte, also favoured a reptilian posture. Müller-Stoll listed a number of characters required for an <b>erect</b> limb posture that Plateosaurus supposedly lacked, concluding that the lizard-like reconstructions were correct. However, most of these adaptations are actually present in Plateosaurus.|$|E
