25|$|In 1906, Machen {{joined the}} Princeton Seminary as an {{instructor}} in the New Testament, after receiving an assurance {{that he would}} not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a statement of faith. Among his Princeton influences were Francis Landey Patton, who had been the prosecutor in a nineteenth-century heresy trial, and B. B. Warfield, whom he described as the greatest man he had ever met. Warfield maintained that correct doctrine was the primary means by which Christians influenced the surrounding culture. He emphasised a high view of scripture and the defence of supernaturalism. It appears that under their influence Machen resolved his crisis of faith. In 1914, he was ordained and the next year he became an Assistant Professor of New Testament studies.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, Ike Turner's {{addiction}} to cocaine {{was so strong}} that he had burned a hole in his nasal septum, leading to nosebleeds, from which he would relieve himself by using more cocaine. During this time, Ike was spending more time at Bolic Sound than he was with Tina and their children at their home in Inglewood. Tina Turner, meanwhile, had looked inward to alleviate her own problems and soon found solace after a friend introduced her to the teachings of Buddhism. In July 1976, Ike intended on signing a five-year contract with a new record company, Cream Records, for a reported yearly amount of $150,000. The contract had a key person clause, meaning Ike would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> the contract in four days, keeping Tina tied to Ike for five more years.|$|E

500|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} {{assembled in the}} territory in July 1857. Divisions between Republicans and Democrats led to the drafting of two separate constitutions.

A single constitution was finally worked out between the two factions though the more powerful Democrats ultimately prevailed on most issues. The resentment between the two parties remained so acrimonious that two separate copies of the constitution had to be used so that members of each party did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a copy signed by members of the other party. The copies were signed on August 29, 1857 and an election was called on October 13, 1857 to approve the document. [...] 30,055 voters approved the constitution, while 571 rejected it.|$|E

He led the Quebec Senior Hockey League in scoring in 1953. However, he {{did not appear to}} show much interest in playing professionally. Finally, Selke got an idea—if the QSHL were somehow turned into a professional league, Béliveau would be a professional as well, and {{under the terms of the}} B-form he would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> with the Habs. At Selke's suggestion, the Canadiens' owners, the Canadian Arena Company, bought the QSHL and converted it from an amateur league to a minor pro league. [...] This forced Béliveau to join the Canadiens for the 1953–54 NHL season (though the Habs owned the NHL rights to all of the league's players in any case).|$|E

Cohn-Bendit also said that he [...] "did not care about Klaus' opinions on the Lisbon Treaty, that Klaus would simply <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> it". Cohn-Bendit also told the Czechs not to interfere with passage of the EU's climate change package.

2500|$|Peng Ming-min, a Taiwan {{independence}} {{activist and}} politician, writes although {{on the surface}} China merely demonstrates its [...] "soft power" [...] through CIs, [...] "Colleges and universities where a Confucius Institute is established all <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a contract in which they declare their support for Beijing’s “one China” policy. As a result, both Taiwan and Tibet have become taboos at these institutes." [...] Peng lists other examples of CI [...] "untouchable" [...] issues including the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, neglect of human rights, environmental pollution in China, and the imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo. However, BC lawyer and China expert Clive Ansley said there were [...] "troubling signs of [...] growing influence on western campuses" [...] before Confucius Institutes were established. He saw signs the public discussions about certain human-rights issues were being self-censored, {{out of fear of}} losing out on intake of Chinese students.|$|E
2500|$|While Chinese {{authorities}} have been cautious {{not to have}} CIs act as direct promoters of the party's political viewpoints, a few suggest that the Confucius Institutes function in this way. Officials say that one important goal of the Institutes is to influence other countries' view of China. Peng Ming-min, a Taiwan independence activist and politician, claims that colleges and universities where a Confucius Institute is established <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a contract in which they declare their support for Beijing's [...] "One China" [...] policy. As a result, both Taiwan and Tibet become taboos at the institutes. However, this claim is in dispute. Michael Nylan, professor of Chinese history at the University of California at Berkeley, stated that CIs have become less heavy-handed in their demands, and have learnt from [...] "early missteps", such as insisting that universities adopt a policy that Taiwan is part of China. Nylan's survey of faculty and administrators at fifteen universities with Confucius Institutes revealed two reports that institutes had exerted pressure to block guest speakers, but both events went ahead anyway.|$|E

2500|$|He {{became the}} {{secretary}} of Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club in 1874, in {{what was to be}} a somewhat controversial tenure in that role. In 1880, the Australians toured England, making considerable money from gate receipts, something English cricketers, regarded as [...] "gentlemen" [...] did not do. Nottinghamshire's Alfred Shaw, however, saw this as an opportunity. He arranged a first-class match between the Players of the North and the Australians at Park Avenue, Bradford {{toward the end of the}} tour, which made Shrewsbury a healthy profit. A few days after this match, he hastily arranged a match between Nottinghamshire and the Australians at Trent Bridge. Seeking once more to make money, Shaw informed Holden that himself and six other Nottinghamshire players would only take to the field for a minimum of £20 each. Holden agreed, albeit reluctantly, and was reported to privately fuming at the demand. In the Autumn, Shaw attempted to arrange an early season fixture for the following season against Yorkshire, with the view of once again profiting from it. Holden found out about this and told Shaw he alone did not have the authority to arrange county fixtures. He proceeded to write to all of Nottinghamshire's professionals, informing them they would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>sign</b> a binding contract under which they would have to be available for all official Nottinghamshire matches. Shaw, Arthur Shrewsbury, William Barnes, Wilfred Flowers, Fred Morley, William Scotton and John Selby disagreed with his proposal.|$|E
