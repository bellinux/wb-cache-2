40|$|As {{an initial}} step to {{elucidate}} {{the nature of}} the unique characteristics of the crystalloids of alveolar soft part sarcoma, a three-dimensional model of the crystalloids was prepared by digital image analysis of electron micrographs by computer. It was revealed that occult periodicities are present at two intervals, 60 A and 380 A, in the filamentous structure of the crystalloid; and it was also revealed by the observation of each cross-section that two globular substances with a diameter of 60 A are arranged <b>in</b> a <b>dumbbell</b> pattern <b>in</b> <b>each</b> filamentous structure. The model prepared based on these data showed the double strands crossing each other at intervals of 380 A, each of which consists of successive arrangement of the globular substances with a diameter of 60 A. This structure is clearly similar to that of actin. The similarities and differences between these results and the well-known studies of the organization of naturally occurring actin bundles are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of habitual bipedalism {{is still a}} fundamental yet unsolved question for paleoanthropologists, and carrying is popular as an explanation for both the early adoption of upright walking and as a positive selection pressure once a terrestrial lifestyle had been adopted. However, to support or reject any hypothesis that suggests carrying efficiency was an important selective pressure, we need quantitative data on the costs of different forms of carrying behavior, especially infant-carrying since reduction in the grasping capabilities of the foot would have prevented infants from clinging on for long durations. In this study, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} mode of load carriage influences the energeticcost of locomotion. Oxygen consumption was measured in seven female participants walking at a constant speed while carrying four different 10 -kg loads (a weighted vest, 5 -kg <b>dumbbells</b> carried <b>in</b> <b>each</b> hand, a mannequin infant carried on one hip, and a 10 -kg <b>dumbbell</b> carried <b>in</b> a single hand). Oxygen consumption was also measured during unloaded standing and unloaded walking. The results show that the weighted vest requires the least amount of energy of the four types of carrying and that, for this condition, humans are as efficient as mammals in general. The balanced load was carried with approximately the predicted energy cost. However, the asymmetrical conditions were considerably less efficient, indicating that, unless infant-carrying was the adaptive response to a strong environmental selection pressure, this behavior is unlikely to have been the precursor to the {{evolution of}} bipedalism...|$|R
40|$|Various {{possible}} orientations of lamellar {{structures of}} diblock copolymers under shear are investigated {{with respect to}} their stability. A Brownian dynamics model is put forward <b>in</b> which <b>each</b> diblock is modeled as a <b>dumbbell.</b> The blobs <b>in</b> <b>each</b> <b>dumbbell</b> are held together by a finite extendable nonlinear elastic (FENE) potential and interact with all surrounding blobs by soft dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) potentials. In addition to this, the blobs have the possibility to entangle with each other. The corresponding interactions lead to large viscosities, which, however, quickly diminish with increasing shear rate. This fact turns out to be crucial for the stabilization of structures with the lamellae parallel to the velocity-vorticity plane. As a second result it is found that asymmetry in the entanglement interactions stimulates the actual reorientation into this state...|$|R
