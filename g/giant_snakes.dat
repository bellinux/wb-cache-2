2500|$|Suggestions that Le Testu {{may have}} mapped (or even visited) Australia are based on: first, his maps' {{depiction}} of a large island (or continent), south of Java, which Le Testu identified as the Jave la Grande ("Java Major" [...] or [...] "Great Java") mentioned by Marco Polo (and was otherwise known {{at the time as}} Terra Australis) and second, Le Testu's incorporation in these maps of birds that resemble black swans and cassowaries, which are both native to Australia. However, he did not claim to have seen Jave la Grande in person and many cartographers at the time incorporated hypothetical, mythological or fantastic elements, a practice that is clearly also true of Le Testu. His maps also showed unicorns and monstrous creatures such as 200 metre long <b>giant</b> <b>snakes,</b> basilisks, satyrs, Blemmyes (headless humans) and Cynocephalics (dog-headed humans).|$|E

Instead, all of these giant serpents appear to have been mythical explanations for natural phenomena and religious concepts.|$|R
