25|$|Two {{different}} classes of mechanisms had become established by this time, reciprocating and rotary. The former type of mechanism was operated typically by a limited-travel hand crank; some internal detailed operations {{took place on}} the pull, and others on the release part of a complete cycle. The illustrated 1914 machine is this type; the crank is vertical, on its right side. Later on, some of these mechanisms were operated by <b>electric</b> <b>motors</b> and <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing</b> that operated a crank and connecting rod to convert rotary motion to reciprocating.|$|R
25|$|Two {{different}} systems were employed. The earlier, fitted to the 1965 through 1968 Ford-built {{cars and the}} 1971–1972 Nissan Cedric, employed an <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> driving, through <b>reduction</b> <b>gearing,</b> a set of three slow-turning cams.

A model of such a machine is a slider-crank mechanism actuated by an asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with <b>reduction</b> <b>gear.</b> For this study, an experimental simulation apparatus was constructed, composed of a reciprocating machine, a direct-current tachometer as diagnostic sensor, and the necessary instrumentation for measurement of loads acting on the slider and thus stresses on the connecting rod. The excellent agreement between the theoretical and experimental results shows the validìty of the solution for monitoring and diagnostics of reciprocating machines using a simple direct-current tachometer connected to an A/D converter {{and then to a}} PC able to execute the fast Fourier transforms of the acquired signals. The proposed method is particularly useful when direct measurements of stresses are difficult or particularly laborious.

40|$|The {{mass and}} sizing {{characteristics}} of manipulators for Lunar and Mars planetary surface applications are investigated by analyzing three structural configurations: a simple cantilevered boom with a square tubular cross-section; a hybrid cable/boom configuration with a square tubular cross-section support structure; and a hybrid cable/boom configuration with a square truss cross-section support structure. Design procedures are {{developed for the}} three configurations and numerical examples are given. A new set of performance parameters are developed that relate the mass of manipulators and cranes to a loading parameter. These parameters enable the masses of different manipulator configurations to be compared {{over a wide range}} of design loads and reach envelopes (radii). The use of these parameters is demonstrated {{in the form of a}} structural efficiency chart using the newly considered manipulator configurations. To understand the performance of Lunar and Mars manipulators, the design procedures were exercised on the three manipulator configurations assuming graphite/epoxy materials for the tubes and trusses. It is also assumed that the actuators are <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> <b>gear</b> <b>reduction</b> systems. Numerical results for manipulator masses and sizes are presented for a variety of manipulator reach and payload mass capabilities. Results are presented that demonstrate the sensitivity of manipulator mass to operational radius, tip force, and actuator efficiency. The effect of the value of gravitational force on the ratio of manipulator-mass to payload-mass is also shown.

A stair case lift is a mechanical device for lifting people and wheelchairs {{up and down on}} the stairs, who may find difficulty in doing so themselves. For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs. A chair or lifting platform is attached to the rail. A person on the chair or platform is lifted as the chair or platform moves along the rail, old age and goods are to be carried across the stair case. Stair case lift is a type of lift that can be mounted on the stair case without altering civil structure. This lift runs on electric power and consists of a <b>motor,</b> <b>reduction</b> <b>gear</b> box, rope drive, two rails a sliding chair. In this system we use DC motor for changing the polarity of the power supply which will make the motor run in reverse direction connected with the earlier, while the later will form the entire assembly run to in downward direction, with the help of Toggle switches and push buttons. Advantages over the conventional hydraulic lift are no civil structure and alteration is required, low cost, less bulkiness, less power, less maintenance requires. Easy design, easy installations. Can be of industrial use too. Moreover, considering some drawbacks due to weight carrying capacity completely depend upon the capacity of motor.
