40|$|Local {{electronic}} {{properties in}} AlxGa 1 -xN/GaN heterostructure field-effect <b>transistor</b> <b>epitaxial</b> layer structures are probed using scanning capacitance microscopy. Acquisition of scanning capacitance images {{over a wide}} range of bias voltages combined with theoretical analysis and numerical simulation allows the presence, detailed nature, and possible structural origins of nanometer- to micron-scale inhomogeneities in electronic structure to be elucidated. Substantial lateral variations in local threshold voltages for transistor channel formation are observed, at length scales ranging from submicron to> 2 µm, and found to arise primarily from local variations in AlxGa 1 -xN layer thickness. Features in electronic structure are also observed that are consistent with the existence of networks of negatively charged threading edge dislocations, as might be formed at island coalescence boundaries during epitaxial growth. The negative charge associated with these structures appears to lead to local depletion of carriers from the channel in the AlxGa 1 -xN/GaN <b>transistor</b> <b>epitaxial</b> layer structure.

5000|$|... ==History and usage== The BC548 {{is a part}} of a higher-quality {{family of}} NPN and PNP <b>epitaxial</b> silicon <b>transistors</b> that {{originated}} with the metal-cased BC108 family of transistors. This series, introduced in 1966 by Philips, became the most used transistors in Australia and was taken up by many European manufacturers. The BC548 is the modern plastic-packaged BC108,; the BC548 article at the Radiomuseum website describes the BC548 as a successor to the BC238 and differing from the BC108 in only the shape of the package. Datasheets for the BC548 give specifications that are identical to, or exceed, those of the BC108, BC148 and BC238 predecessors. Thus the BC548 (or BC546 to 550) is a valid substitute in any circuit designed for the older BC108 (or BC148), which includes many Mullard and Philips published designs.|$|R

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{for measuring the}} bandgap narrowing {{in the base of}} a Si homojunction or Si/SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor from the temperature dependence of the collector current. The model includes the temperature dependence of the intrinsic carrier concentration, the bandgap, the minority carrier mobility, and freeze-out of dopant in the base. The analysis method is applied to <b>transistors</b> with <b>epitaxial</b> Si and SiGe bases, and also to Si devices with ion implanted bases. For the <b>epitaxial</b> base <b>transistors,</b> where the base boron profiles are sharp, a linear characteristic is obtained from which the bandgap narrowing in the base can be calculated. For a SiGe HBT with 16 % Ge in the base, a bandgap narrowing of 117 meV is obtained, which compares very well with the theoretical value of 117 meV for the valence band offset. For the implanted base transistors, a linear characteristic is not obtained. This is explained by the presence of doping tails on the base profile...|$|R
40|$|A unified {{closed form}} {{analytical}} model for base transit time of SiGe HBT's for uniform and exponential base dopant distributions with different Ge profiles {{in the base}} (e. g., box, trapezoidal, triangular) is reported. The model is subsequently used to study the design of Ge profile for different base doping profiles, including that of <b>epitaxial</b> base <b>transistors.</b> Consistent with the reported results, our unified model predicts that beyond a certain total Ge content, {{there is very little}} reduction in b;SiGe : It is further demonstrated that the trapezoidal Ge profile with XT 0 : 8 WB gives near optimal base transit time for all doping profiles considered. Our analysis shows that 1) for a given base width and intrinsic base resistance, the exponential base doping profile with Ge yields the least value of b;SiGe and 2) for a given peak base doping concentration and the intrinsic base resistance, the uniform base doping with Ge gives minimum b;SiGe : Also, the need for keeping the total base Ge content constant while optimizing the Ge profile in the base is emphasized by showing that a false minimum for b;SiGe may appear if the total Ge content is not kept constant...|$|R
40|$|Irradiation {{damage in}} n+-Si/p+-Sil_,Ge, {{epitaxial}} diodes and n+-Si/p+-Sil-,Ge,/n-Si <b>epitaxial</b> heterojunction bipolar <b>transistors</b> (HBTs) is studied {{as a function}} of germanium content, radiation source, and fluence. The degradation of electrical performance of the devices by irradiation increases with increasing fluence, while it decreases with increasing germanium content. The induced lattice defects in the Sil-,Ge, epitaxial layer and Si substrate are studied by DLTS methods. In the Si,-,Ge, epitaxial layer of diodes and HBTs, an electron capture level which is associntcd with interstitial boron is induced by irradiation, while electron capture levels corresponding to E center and divacancy are formed in the collector region for HBTs. The impact of the radiation source on the degradation of performance is correlated with simulations of the number of knock-on atoms and the nonionizing energy loss (NIEL). 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} apply GHz {{frequencies}} {{to control the}} quantum state of a single P atom is an essential requirement for the fast gate pulsing needed for qubit control in donor based silicon quantum computation. Here we demonstrate this with nanosecond accuracy in an all <b>epitaxial</b> single atom <b>transistor</b> by applying excitation signals at frequencies up to ≈ 13 GHz to heavily phosphorous doped silicon leads. These measurements allow the differentiation between the excited states of the single atom and the density of states in the one dimensional leads. Our pulse spectroscopy experiments confirm {{the presence of an}} excited state at an energy ≈ 9 meV consistent with the first excited state of a single P donor in silicon. The relaxation rate of this first excited state to ground is estimated to be larger than 2. 5 GHz, consistent with theoretical predictions. These results represent a systematic investigation of how an atomically precise single atom transistor device behaves under rf excitations.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to perform a systematic investigation of the unique structural and electrical properties of epitaxial graphene at the nanoscale. As the semiconductor industry faces increasing challenges in the production of integrated circuits, due to process complexity and scaling limitations, new materials research has come to the forefront of both science and engineering disciplines. Graphene, an atomically-thin sheet of carbon, was examined as a material which may replace or become integrated with silicon nanoelectronics. Specifically, this research was focused on epitaxial graphene produced on silicon carbide. This material system, as opposed to other types of graphene, holds great promise for large-scale manufacturing, and is therefore of wide interest to the academic and industrial community. In this work, high-quality epitaxial graphene production was optimized, followed by the process development necessary to fabricate <b>epitaxial</b> graphene nanoribbon <b>transistors</b> for electrical characterization. The structural and electrical transport properties of the nanoribbons were elucidated through a series of distinct experiments. First, the size-dependent conductivity of epitaxial graphene at the nanoscale was investigated. Next, the alleviation of the detrimental effects revealed during the size-dependent conductivity study was achieved through the selective functionalization of graphene with hydrogen. Finally, two techniques were developed to allow for the complementary doping of epitaxial graphene. All of the experiments presented herein reveal new and important aspects of epitaxial graphene at the nanoscale that must be considered if the material is to be adopted for use by the semiconductor industry.
