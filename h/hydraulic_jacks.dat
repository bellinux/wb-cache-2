5|$|The {{main problem}} with {{upgrading}} the Wakefield branch was {{the dimensions of}} George Leather's cast iron aqueduct over the River Calder at Stanley Ferry. Structural analysis showed that parts of the ironwork were overloaded, and so in 1981 a new concrete aqueduct was cast by John Laing Construction Ltd, on a site a little further upstream. The complete structure was then pushed into position by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> in a six-day operation, after which the navigation was diverted over it, although the old aqueduct was left in place and can still be used.|$|E

An automobile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> system can be easily attached to all currently manufacture automobile chassis and frames. There is a front suspension <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> that is mounted centrally to the front suspension of an automobile between its front wheels. There is also a rear suspension <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> that is mounted centrally to the rear suspension of the automobile between its rear wheels. The system operates from a compressed fluid reservoir tank that has connections for {{the front and rear}} car jack outlets. Additional outlets can be added to the compressed fluid reservoir tank for connecting a hydraulic lug wrench and another for a tire inflating hose. The Major Project entitled “Inbuilt <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jack</b> in automobile vehicle ” Worked on the principal of hydraulic power and operated by 12 Volt DC current, solves the all major problem of maintenance of all automobiles specially the heavy vehicles like truck and bus. This work, if implemented, would definitely help in the maintenance of automobiles and also in saving of time. I...|$|R

5|$|Northumberland, {{named after}} the {{ceremonial}} county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before {{she was ready to}} be launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for an hour on the slipway before she slid halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next spring tide failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.|$|E
5|$|The skins or {{heads of}} taiko are {{generally}} made from cowhide from Holstein cows aged {{about three or}} four years. Skins also come from horses, and bull skin is preferred for larger drums. Thinner skins are preferred for smaller taiko, and thicker skins are used for larger ones. On some drumheads, a patch of deer skin placed in the center serves as the target for many strokes during performance. Before fitting it to the drum body the hair is removed from the hide by soaking it in a river or stream for about a month; winter months are preferred as colder temperatures better facilitate hair removal. To stretch the skin over the drum properly, one process requires the body to be held on a platform with several <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacks</b> underneath it. The edges of the cowhide are secured to an apparatus below the jacks, and the jacks stretch the skin incrementally to precisely apply tension across the drumhead. Other forms of stretching use rope or cords with wooden dowels or an iron wheel to create appropriate tension. Small tension adjustments can be made during this process using small pieces of bamboo that twist around the ropes. Particularly large drumheads are sometimes stretched by having several workers, clad in stockings, hop rhythmically atop it, forming a circle along the edge. After the skin has dried, tacks, called byō, are added to the appropriate drums to secure it; chū-daiko require about 300 of them for each side. After the body and skin have been finished, excess hide is cut off and the drum can be stained as needed.|$|E

40|$|Pretensioned {{high-strength}} concrete (PHC) pipe piles {{have been}} widely used for geotechnical engineering such as foundation engineering, slope engineering, highway engineering. To study the performance of a PHC pipe pile under <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking,</b> the monitoring of the strain profile along the PHC pipe pile under <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> was carried out using FBG sensing technology. In this study, a PHC pipe pile was instrumented with two series of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors along pile axial direction and was then installed in the field using a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> method. To monitor the variation of strains along a PHC pile, two series of eight FBG strain sensors with different peak wavelengths were mounted {{on opposite sides of the}} pile with one meter spacing. In addition, based on the pile theory, both the axial force of the pile and average shear stress on the pile surface are calculated using the measured axial strains. It is found that there were significant residual strains in the piles after installation when hydraulic force was removed.

40|$|<b>Hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> is a {{significant}} dilation of a fracture that occurs when the pore pressure within it exceeds {{the sum of the}} fracture's normal stress and tensile strength. This phenomenon may occur during a glacial period because of changes in hydraulic and mechanical boundary conditions. Since <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> may alter flow patterns and the transport capacity of the rock mass, its possible effects on the long-term performance of a nuclear waste repository should be considered. We develop an approach to assess glacially induced <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> in fractured crystalline rock and establish bounding estimates of the maximum jacking depth for the Swedish Nuclear Fuel and Waste Management Company's (SKB) repository site at Forsmark. The pore pressure is estimated using mechanically uncoupled two-dimensional poroelastic continuum models with hydraulic and mechanical conditions based on SKB's reconstruction of the Weichselian glaciation at this site (120 - 0 kaB. P.). For warm-based conditions, the water pressure at the ice/bed interface is set at 98 % of the mechanical load, whereas for glacial conditions with extensive proglacial permafrost, the corresponding water pressure is set at a (lower) annual average value. We demonstrate that the pore pressure within the uppermost kilometer of rock is mainly governed by the water pressure at the ice/bed interface and that the mechanical impact of the ice load on the pore pressure is sufficiently small to be ignored. Given the current and estimated future stress conditions at Forsmark, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> is mainly of concern for subhorizontal fractures, i. e., it is sufficient to consider situations when the pore pressure exceeds the vertical stress. We conclude that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>jacking</b> at Forsmark will be confined to the uppermost 200 m of the rock mass...|$|R

After surveying the site in September and October 1943, Organisation Todt engineers determined that the northern part of the facility was irretrievably damaged but decided to focus on completing the southern part to serve as a LOX factory. One of the OT's engineers, Werner Flos, came up with an idea to protect the bunker from bombardment by building it up from the roof first. This was done by initially constructing a concrete plate, flat on the ground, which was [...] thick and weighed 37,000 tons.
