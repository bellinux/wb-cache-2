5|$|On May 22, villagers {{returned}} to Masada and Sha'ar HaGolan, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> destroyed. Expecting another attack, reinforcements from the Carmeli Brigade took up {{positions in the}} two villages. Many of the participants of the battles were sent to Tiberias to rest and recuperate, and the units that lost soldiers were reorganized.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} tax on coal, a two-cent-per-gallon tax on gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E

5|$|Boone {{served as}} syndic and commandant until 1804, when Missouri {{became part of}} the United States {{following}} the Louisiana Purchase. Because Boone's land grants from the Spanish government <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> based on verbal agreements, he once again lost his land claims. In 1809, he petitioned Congress to restore his Spanish land claims, which was finally done in 1814. Boone sold most of this land to repay old Kentucky debts. When the War of 1812 came to Missouri, Boone's sons Daniel Morgan Boone and Nathan Boone took part, but by that time Boone was much too old for militia duty.|$|E
5|$|City {{leaders are}} working to bring new life into this area, by renovating and {{building}} new homes and attracting businesses. The completion of Interstate 664 restored the area to access and through traffic which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> rerouted with {{the completion of the}} Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel in 1958 and discontinuance of the Newport News-Norfolk ferry service at that time. The larger capacity Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel and the rebuilt James River Bridge each restored some accessibility and through traffic to the downtown area.|$|E
5|$|During May 1809, the frigates Félicité and Furieuse {{remained}} at Guadeloupe, taking on stores {{and preparing for}} their eventual return journey to France. Although they were both large frigates, they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> disarmed in France to create space for cargo: Furieuse was provided with only 20 cannon (including 12 carronades) and a crew of just 200, while Félicité had even fewer defences, carrying just 14 cannon and 174 men. Watching these ships was a small British blockade force led by Hugh Pigot in Latona with a few brigs and sloops, Cochrane's invasion fleet having been dispersed.|$|E

5|$|For the Persians, the two {{expeditions to}} Greece <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> successful; new territories {{had been added}} to their empire and Eretria had been punished. It was only a minor setback that the {{invasion}} had met defeat at Marathon; that defeat barely dented the enormous resources of the Persian empire. Yet, for the Greeks, it was an enormously significant victory. It {{was the first time}} that Greeks had beaten the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.|$|E
5|$|Joseph M. Pettit became {{president}} of the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1972. During his 14-year tenure as president, Pettit was credited with turning Georgia Tech into a top-flight research institution. Pettit has also received credit for shifting Georgia Tech back to its roots with regards to providing assistance with economic development within the state of Georgia. In the decades known for the Vietnam War and the launch of Sputnik, research at Georgia Tech and the Georgia Tech Research Institute had become so tied with NASA and the Department of Defense that local industrial development <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> forgotten.|$|E
5|$|On May 9, 1992, Armenian forces {{captured}} the mountain stronghold of Shusha but {{remained on the}} defensive until the next year. Fighting between Armenians and Azeris continued {{in other parts of}} the enclave, including Lachin, Khojavend, and Aghdara. However, nearly all offensives launched by Azerbaijan failed or could not hold on to captured territory. By the spring of 1993 the Azerbaijani military, which had the upper hand in the initial stages of the war, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> reduced to unorganized and incoherent fighting groups. By March 1993 the fighting had shifted to west and south of Karabakh.|$|E

5|$|The Kirk {{that had}} been {{established}} at the Reformation, <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> united since the Declaration of the Covenant in 1638. In the period after the defeat at Dunbar, it became divided, partly {{in the search for}} scapegoats for defeat. Different factions and tendencies produced rival resolutions and protests, which gave their names to the two major parties as Resolutioners, who were willing to make an accommodation with royalism, and more hard line Protesters who wished to purge the Kirk of such associations. Subsequently, the divide between rival camps became almost irrevocable. After 1655 both groups appointed permanent agents in London.|$|E
5|$|The {{battle was}} {{the climax of}} Julian's campaigns in 355–57 to evict barbarian marauders from Gaul and to restore the Roman {{defensive}} line of fortifications along the Rhine, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> destroyed during the Roman civil war of 350–53. In the years following his victory at Strasbourg, Julian was able to repair and garrison the Rhine forts and impose tributary status on the Germanic tribes beyond the border.|$|E
5|$|The cover art for Amazing <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky {{during the late}} fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers {{for the first few}} years of Amazing, contributed a wraparound cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E

5|$|The {{role of the}} English Church {{had been}} a matter for great debate in the {{years prior to the}} 1215 charter. The Norman and Angevin kings had {{traditionally}} exercised a great deal of power over the church within their territories. From the 1040s onwards successive popes had emphasised the importance of the church being governed more effectively from Rome, and had established an independent judicial system and hierarchical chain of authority. After the 1140s, these principles <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> accepted within the English church, even if accompanied by an element of concern about centralising authority in Rome.|$|E
5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little room to {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no room to maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|Tod also {{submitted}} archæological {{papers to}} the Royal Asiatic Society's Transactions series. He {{was interested in}} numismatics as well, and he discovered the first specimens of Bactrian and Indo-Greek coins from the Hellenistic period following the conquests of Alexander the Great, which were described in his books. These ancient kingdoms <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> forgotten or considered semi-legendary, but Tod's findings confirmed the long-term Greek presence in Afghanistan and Punjab. Similar coins {{have been found in}} large quantities since his death.|$|E

5|$|Van der Byl was {{appointed}} Minister of Foreign Affairs and Defence on 2 August 1974. These were two distinct portfolios, {{the first of}} which (Foreign Affairs) did not amount to much in a state which lacked any form of international recognition. The Defence portfolio, at a time when Rhodesia was drifting into civil war, was an important post; although his previous political experience <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> in the area of public relations, he was now charged with responsibilities which were central to the survival of Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|After D-Day, Allied troops {{crossed the}} Belgian {{frontier}} on 1 September 1944. German forces {{did little to}} oppose the liberating forces, which by 4 September were in control of Brussels, although the last occupied parts of Belgian territory were only liberated in February 1945. On 8 September 1944, the government in exile returned to Brussels and was greeted with general indifference. Although the King {{was no longer in}} the country, his Political Testament was presented to the returned Government as he had wished, and was soon circulated publicly. At the same time, a copy was presented to the British king, George VI, and was seen by the Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden. The text reignited the divisions within the Government which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> hidden since earlier in the war.|$|E
5|$|After {{a series}} of night engagements between the leading battleships and British destroyers, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British light forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven a few hours later; the I Squadron battleships took up {{defensive}} positions in the outer roadstead and Kaiser, Kaiserin, Prinzregent Luitpold, and Kronprinz stood ready just outside the entrance to Wilhelmshaven. The remainder of the battleships and battlecruisers entered Wilhelmshaven, where those that were still in fighting condition replenished their stocks of coal and ammunition. The two shell hits suffered by Kaiser <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>largely</b> ineffectual, wounding only one crewmember.|$|E
