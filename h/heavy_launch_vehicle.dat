This {{came at a}} time when the president's {{administration}} was being criticized considerably for leaving the Constellation Program out of the 2011 budget. At the conference, President Obama and top officials, as well as leaders in the field of spaceflight, discussed the future of U.S. efforts in human spaceflight and unveiled a plan for NASA that followed the Augustine Panel's [...] "Flexible Path to Mars" [...] option, modifying president Obama's prior proposal to include the continuing development of the Orion capsule as an auxiliary system to the ISS and setting the year 2015 as the deadline for the design of a new Super <b>Heavy</b> <b>Launch</b> <b>Vehicle.</b> In October 2010, the NASA authorization bill for 2010 was signed into law which canceled Constellation.
