5|$|After {{a five-year}} gap {{in contact with}} the Astros organization, Bagwell {{accepted}} a formal invitation from manager A. J. Hinch to be a guest instructor <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> of 2015.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of a}} {{personal}} services contract Bagwell signed with the Astros, {{he served as a}} coach <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> of 2007.|$|E

5|$|DeGrom {{initially}} {{refused to}} sign the 2016 contract for the $607,000 salary assigned to him. As a third-year player not yet eligible for arbitration, deGrom was bound by the MLB Collective Bargaining Agreement to accept the salary assigned {{to him by his}} club. He eventually relented and reluctantly capitulated to signing his contract early <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b>|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{his speed}} {{garnered}} him comparisons to New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez. Braun has been timed at 4.2 seconds {{to first base}} from {{the right side of}} the plate. <b>In</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in 2007, he was second-fastest in the Brewers' 60-yard dash.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in 2014, Núñez {{competed with}} Zelous Wheeler, Yangervis Solarte, Dean Anna, and Scott Sizemore for a reserve infielder role with the Yankees. With reserve infielder Brendan Ryan {{starting}} the {{season on the}} disabled list, the Yankees chose Anna and Solarte over Núñez. To add Solarte to the roster, the Yankees designated Núñez for assignment.|$|E

5|$|Nova secured {{for a spot}} in the {{starting}} rotation for the 2012 season <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> He won 15 consecutive games from June 2011 through May 2012, one short of the franchise record set by Roger Clemens. He surpassed the Yankees' rookie record of twelve consecutive wins, set by Atley Donald in 1939, during the 2011 season.|$|E
5|$|Ramírez {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the Giants in 2013, but he was released on March 22 after posting an 11.25 ERA <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> He was re-signed and appeared in 6 games for the Giants before being designated for assignment.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he had a}} solid {{performance}} <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> Hughes {{began the}} 2009 season in Triple-A. He was called up to the majors in April after Chien-Ming Wang {{was placed on the}} disabled list. Hughes made his first start of the season on April 28 against the Detroit Tigers and pitched six scoreless innings, earning his first win since 2007 in an 11–0 victory. On May 25, Hughes threw eight scoreless innings, earning the win in an 11–1 victory over the Rangers.|$|E

5|$|Before spring {{training}} in 2009, there was speculation that if Garko {{did not perform}} well, he might lose his starting first base job. Garko began practicing the outfield position for the upcoming season. Eric Wedge stated that Garko would in fact be playing the outfield <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> On June 21, Garko was held {{out of the game}} because of a sprained left wrist.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{was signed}} by the St. Louis Cardinals on January 6, 2003, but was {{released}} on March 26, 2003 after struggling <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> Hamilton then re-signed with the Cincinnati Reds on April 11, 2003. After posting a 12.66 ERA in three starts with the Reds, he was sent down to Louisville. He made 33 appearances for the Bats with an 83 record and a 3.23 ERA in 86 innings. On October 15, 2003, he became a free agent.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, Reynolds won 16 games, {{even though}} he pitched with bone chips in his elbow for the entire season. His {{remarkable}} 1951 season began under very difficult conditions. Floating chips in his elbow prevented him from throwing a single pitch <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training.</b> He was resigned to having surgery which would have cost him {{at least half of}} the season. Dr. George Bennett of Johns Hopkins University recommended against surgery. Reynolds appeared in his first game one week after the season started.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt was not {{expected}} to make the Kansas City Royals' roster in 2002, but he {{was added to the}} bullpen after he had an 0.64 ERA and fourteen strikeouts (to go with just two walks) in fourteen innings <b>in</b> <b>Spring</b> <b>training.</b> His major league debut came on April 6 against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched two innings, giving up three hits and a run in a 140 loss. On April 24, Affeldt picked up his first major league win by pitching 3.2 innings of relief in an 82 win over the Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Chesbro {{met with}} Highlanders owner Frank J. Farrell and new manager Harry Wolverton in February 1912 about {{attempting}} a comeback. Wolverton {{agreed to give}} Chesbro a chance at pitching for the Highlanders. However, before leaving for camp he reconsidered and released Chesbro. Chesbro's request for reinstatement {{as a free agent}} was granted in March, while the Highlanders granted him his unconditional release. Chesbro decided to travel to Hot Springs, Arkansas, where teams participated <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> in an attempt to find a team willing to give him a chance at a comeback. He worked out with Brooklyn and Pittsburgh, but both teams passed on him.|$|E
5|$|Considered the fourth-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} by Baseball America {{heading into the}} 1995 season, the Yankees projected Jeter as their starting shortstop. He suffered mild inflammation in his right shoulder in the Arizona Fall League after {{the conclusion of the}} 1994 regular season. As a precaution, the Yankees signed Tony Fernández to a two-year contract. With Fernández the starting shortstop, the Yankees assigned Jeter to Class AAA. During the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, Gene Michael, the Yankees' general manager, offered Jeter the opportunity to work out for the MLB team with replacement players <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> before the 1995 season. Jeter denied receiving the offer, and did not cross the picket line.|$|E

5|$|Hornsby went {{unsigned}} by {{any team}} in 1943, but he signed as a player-manager with the Vera Cruz Blues of La Liga Mexicana in Mexico in 1944. After hitting a game-winning grand slam for the second win of a series in March, he resigned when the team owner complained that the win would diminish the crowd for the third game of the series. Following his release, he did some commentary for radio station WTMV, assisted the Cleveland Indians <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> in 1947, and became a TV announcer for Chicago Cubs games in 1949.|$|E
5|$|On February 16, 2017, Latos {{signed a}} minor league {{contract}} with the Toronto Blue Jays. After not winning {{a spot on the}} Blue Jays' roster <b>in</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training,</b> Latos accepted an assignment to the Buffalo Bisons of the International League. He made two starts for the Bisons, pitching to a 1.00 ERA in nine innings, and the Blue Jays promoted Latos to the major leagues on April 21 after injuries to the team's starting rotation. Latos started three games for the Blue Jays, pitching to a 6.60 ERA and 1.80 WHIP. The Blue Jays designated Latos for assignment on May 5, and outrighted him back to Buffalo on May 8. He was released by the team on May 30.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers won the 1963 World Series. This series {{represented}} {{the first time}} that the New York Yankees had lost a World Series in four games. Alston's pitchers excelled, as Koufax struck out 23 batters over two games and Drysdale threw a shutout in Game 3. Over the four games, Alston employed only three starting pitchers and one relief pitcher in the series. In 1964, the team finished 80-82 in its first losing season in several years. Alston used the team's 1964 performance to motivate them moving forward. <b>In</b> <b>spring</b> <b>training</b> before the 1965 season, he said that he would not let his team forget the difficulties they had in the previous season.|$|E
