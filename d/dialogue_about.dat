Wording that expresses this concept {{in the form of a}} commandment may also give offense.|$|E

25|$|Collectively, a {{key feature}} of RICS {{building}} surveys {{are that they}} {{provide an opportunity for}} clients and surveyors to strike up a detailed <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> the property they are intending to purchase.

The building survey is a very interactive process.|$|E
25|$|Southern land owners regained {{control over}} {{almost all of}} the land they had claimed before the war. The {{national}} <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> land ownership as a key to success for freedpeople gave way (in the sphere of White politics and media) to the implementation of a plantation wage system. Under pressure from Johnson and other pro-capital politicians in the North, and from almost all of White society in the South, the Freedmen's Bureau was transformed from a protector of land rights to an enforcer of wage labor.|$|E
25|$|Lesbian {{feminism}} typically situates {{the state}} of being a lesbian {{as a form of}} resistance to patriarchal institutions. Sexual orientation is posited here as a choice, or at least a conscious response to a situation. It is also seen as a critique of male supremacy, chauvinism, and masculinity in general. Lesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist strategy that enables women to invest their energies in other women, creating new space and <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> women's relationships, and typically limits their dealings with men.|$|E

25|$|Dasein is {{therefore}} enabled to participate authentically in co-creating meaningful truth {{for his life}} as he engages in healthy, meaningful relationships—including in therapy. Where other mainstream approaches discourage <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> subjective meaning and truth {{in an effort to}} maintain therapist objectivity and value-neutrality, ontological hermeneutics encourages authentic dialogue between therapist and client that co-creates meaningful, subjective truth to enrich the life of the client. This process not only provides new perspective for the client via the fusing of horizons, but it also serves {{as a model for the}} client to follow when he goes into the world and seeks authentic relationships vital to psychological well-being.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2007 {{study by}} MacPherson, {{prenatal}} Diagnostic Techniques Act (PCPNDT Act) was highly publicized by NGOs and the government. Many {{of the ads}} used depicted abortion as violent, creating fear of abortion itself within the population. The ads focused on the religious and moral shame associated with abortion. MacPherson claims this media campaign was not effective because some perceived this as an attack on their character, leading to many becoming closed off, rather than opening a <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> the issue. This emphasis on morality, claims MacPherson, increased fear and shame associated with all abortions, leading {{to an increase in}} unsafe abortions in India.|$|E
25|$|Blue Movie by Andy Warhol, {{released}} in 1969, and, more freely, Mona, by Bill Osco, {{released in}} 1970, {{were the first}} films depicting explicit sex to receive wide theatrical distribution in the United States. Although Blue Movie involved sexual intercourse, the film, starring Viva and Louis Waldon, included substantial <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> the Vietnam War and various mundane tasks. Besides being a seminal film in the 'Golden Age of Porn', Blue Movie, according to Warhol, was a major influence {{in the making of}} Last Tango in Paris, an internationally controversial erotic drama film, starring Marlon Brando, and released a few years after Blue Movie was made.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, Wales and then-fellow {{member of}} the WMF Board of Trustees Angela Beesley founded the for-profit company Wikia. Wikia is a wiki farm—a {{collection}} of individual wikis on different subjects, all hosted on the same website. It hosts {{some of the largest}} wikis outside Wikipedia, including Memory Alpha (devoted to Star Trek) and Wookieepedia (Star Wars). Another service offered by Wikia was Wikia Search, an open source search engine intended to challenge Google and introduce transparency and public <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> how it is created into the search engine's operations, but the project was abandoned in March 2009. Wales stepped down as Wikia CEO to be replaced by angel investor Gil Penchina, a former {{vice president and general manager}} at eBay, on June 5, 2006. Penchina declared Wikia to have reached profitability in September 2009. In addition to his role at Wikia, Wales is a public speaker represented by the Harry Walker Agency.

I was full nude". An unrestricted version of the video was later uploaded to Rihanna's official website. Melina Matsoukas responded to the news in an interview with MTV News, stating: [...] "When I go out to make something, I kind of go out with the intention to get it banned– [...] not to get it banned... but to make something provocative... it's making an effect and people are having a <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> it, so, to me, that's successful." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the phenomenon}} of a shift {{of the burden of}} proof in legal persuasion dialogues. Some sample dialogues are analysed of types of situations where such a shift may occur, viz. reasoning with defeasible rules, reasoning with argumentation schemes and reasoning with mere presumptions. It is argued that whether a shift in the burden of proof occurs can itself become the subject of dispute and it is shown how a dialogue game protocol for persuasion can be extended to let it regulate persuasion <b>dialogues</b> <b>about</b> the burden of proof. It is also shown that <b>dialogues</b> <b>about</b> the burden of proof are often implicitly about the precise form of the rules used in an argument. 1...|$|R

Me, dead. Imagine that!" [...] I think it's probably Louis-Dreyfus' best moment of the show so far, because she's really starting to nail Elaine's declarative, vaguely imperious, self-centered tone."

500|$|On February 23, 2007, Abrams {{accepted}} Paramount's {{offer to}} direct the film, after having initially been attached to it solely as a producer.

[...] Orci and Kurtzman said that their aim had been to impress a casual fan like Abrams with their story. Abrams noted that, during filming, he had been nervous [...] "with all these tattooed faces and pointy ears, bizarre weaponry and Romulan linguists, with <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> 'Neutral Zones' and 'Starfleet' [...] I knew this would work, because the script Alex and Bob wrote was so emotional and so relatable.

He has traveled to England, Italy, the Netherlands, France, South Africa, China, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan to promote baseball.

[...] He has also served as something of an unofficial baseball ambassador to the African-American community, often participating in and initiating <b>dialogue</b> <b>about</b> the lack of black players {{at all levels of the}} sport. When he endorsed Nike, Inc., Louisville Slugger and Rawlings, he asked them to donate money to his foundation or equipment to inner-city baseball programs rather than pay him.|$|E
