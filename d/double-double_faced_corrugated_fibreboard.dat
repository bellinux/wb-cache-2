The long storage and shipping times, low temperature (~ 0 °C) and high humidity (> 70 %RH) conditions require boxes manufactured from high performance <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard.</b> As the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> boxes are a significant expense, improvements to reduce the weight and therefore {{the cost of the}} <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> while maintaining their vertical compression strength, would increase the apple and kiwifruit industries profitability Through analysis of the literature it was established that the greatest contributor to box compression strength was the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> edgewise compression strength, which is significantly affected by moisture. The strength of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> decreases with increasing moisture content, which tends to be high in low-temperature high-humidity cool-stores. The literature also indicated that temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium could be optimised to reduce the damage caused during the fluting process. The objectives of this study included improving box compression strength predictions by measuring the effect of moisture and temperature on the strength of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and measuring the relationship between temperature, humidity and <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> moisture content. The objectives also included developing a mathematical model to optimise the operations preceding the fluting process by predicting the fluting medium moisture content and temperature just prior to the fluting process. The measurements of <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> properties enabled the widely known McKee’s equation to be modified to enable the prediction of box compression strength over a range of moisture contents (7 to 30 %db), the valves of which could be estimated using the moisture sorption isotherms developed in this study over the temperature and relative humidity range of 0 to 20 °C and 40 to 90 %RH. A mathematical model was developed to predict how the operation of the corrugator would affect the temperature and moisture content of the fluting medium just prior to the fluting process. The model was tested by running the corrugator at normal and extreme settings based on the model’s predictions, and measuring the strength properties of the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> produced. The measured strength properties indicated that the machine speed and steam shower could have an effect but the too were inconsistent to established firm conclusions...|$|R

40|$|Multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard,</b> has {{in recent}} years been gaining {{attention}} {{as a replacement for}} polymeric materials for protective packaging for environmental reasons. The properties of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> make it a sustainable replacement for poly-foam and polystyrene. Pre-compressed multilayered fibreboard cushions have most of the structural resistance and damping removed, and the properties of air-flow through the flutes becomes a more predominant, they behave more like a soft spring. Artificially restricting the exiting airflow or prudently choosing the direction of flutes in the case of rectangular cushions, allows for the differing design situations that may be required. A mathematical model is developed, to describe the pre-compressing process. Mathematical models and software are developed, based on the airflow characteristics, that allow for the prediction of peak acceleration for differing end conditions or sizes providing the friction component can be estimated using iterative methods. The models were verified by a static compression test for the pre-compression and by dropping a mass, or platen and recording the resistive acceleration, or dynamic behaviour, over a time range. There exists an acceleration component prior to platen contact, which is also modelled and should be considered in the interpretation of test results. The study has presented three models to allow for the prediction of the behaviour of multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> for the use as protective cushions. The main thrust has been the behaviour of the airflow during and prior to impact whilst testing. The models developed will assist in the design of protective packaging and produce predictive tools for the use in the packaging industry...|$|R

The properties of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> make it a sustainable replacement for poly-foam and polystyrene. Pre-compressed multilayered fibreboard cushions have most of the structural resistance and damping removed, they behave more like a soft spring. The performance of pre-compressed multi-layered <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> as a protective cushion is influenced by the amount of moisture present. The material stiffness is also dependent on the amount of moisture present. Static compression testing can be carried out to obtain stiffness data by measuring load versus controlled deflection, with stiffness being the load required to deflect a specified distance. The creep properties can be obtained by measuring deflection with a controlled force over a period of time, that is, creep is a measure of deflection per time under a constant force. Models can be developed to simulate creep data, the Voigt model of Visco-elasticity, a spring – damper model makes a reasonable choice of model. This model is an exponentially decaying expression that can be adapted with respect to static strain, stress or stiffness and can be fitted to creep data. Curve fitting with a non-linear optimisation technique shows the model has a reasonable fit with experimental data. Creep data and curve fitting shows an unexpected trend in that as the humidity level is raised the creep strain levels reduce. The effect of this is offset by higher static strains occurring at higher humidity levels. At higher humidity levels when using the exponential model the creep strain reaches the 63...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{loosely packed}} items in rigid or {{semi-rigid}} containers is widespread. These packages are very often handled by high speed equipment {{and put in}} different environmental conditions which includes the possibility of mechanical damage, due to shock, impact and compression. So {{care must be taken}} that damage does not occur to both package and contents. The development of analytical and simulation techniques for investigating the dynamic behaviour of a package subject to handling and distribution hazards is becoming more possible by the use {{of a wide range of}} available software. The modelling of the dynamic behaviour of packaging systems during handling and transport is achieved by mathematical analysis where possible and supported by computer simulation. The analysis was carried out for a range of body properties in order to test the results against experimental data. Investigations into the applied package force/motion and subsequent package impact and deformation were carried out with a view to gaining an understanding of the forces involved. The dynamic analysis was undertaken using commercially available software but it is necessary to develop special techniques to enable it to be applied to this type of problem. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> containers subjected to internal and external loading will be subjected to stress, strain, deflection, and buckling to side panels. A Finite Element method of analysis of the panel was developed. The reaction of the panel to loading can be observed by means of this method. The failure of the container due to the loading can be predicted and the variability of the material and the panel can be changed arbitrarily to test and analyze different packaging designs. <b>Corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> and container elements were treated as engineering structures so the engineering concepts of stress, stain, equilibrium and compatibility could be applied. A Finite Element method using the ANSYS code made it possible to analyze the structure behaviour and helps to partly solve the design optimization process for a corrugated container.

Measurements were made of vibration, shock, temperature, relative humidity, and handling impacts in a typical produce distribution environment, and a dynamic performance test method was developed. It was concluded that this dynamic test method is more sensitive to performance differences between boxes than standard quasi-static methods. The dynamic tests, however, take considerably more time to conduct than standard quasi-static methods and are not suitable for automation.

The cyclic condition was more detrimental. Recycled boxes experienced greater losses in compression strength than virgin boxes. Significant differences in final compression strength also existed between virgin and recycled boxes for three different humidities. The final compression strength was not only related to moisture content, but also related to the moisture content history of the boxes.

40|$|Cooling {{of freshly}} {{harvested}} produce {{is crucial for}} maintaining a high product quality for a prolonged storage period and to reduce postharvest losses. Modelling the cooling process of packed horticultural produce provides a means for improving package designs and cooling operations. In this work, a methodology to more accurately model the cooling process of randomly stacked produce in packages is presented. First, a validated geometrical 3 D shape model generator of apple fruit is used to create realistic CAD models. The generator also considers the biological variability of the produce shape to create a database of more than 100 representative fruits of each cultivar. A discrete element model (DEM) then randomly selects surface meshed bodies from the database to simulate the gravitational packing of produce in a designated box or bin. The resulting stacking pattern of the produce is used to generate a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The CFD model solves the airflow, heat and mass transfer through the packages to evaluate the aerodynamic and cooling performance of packages under different conditions and configurations. The difference between using actual 3 D fruit shapes and an approach using equivalent spheres is demonstrated in a simulation study of forced airflow cooling of apple fruit (cv. Braeburn) packed in a “Supervent” telescopic <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> package under typical precooling conditions.

40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{strength}} and low density, the <b>corrugated</b> <b>fibreboard</b> (CFB) box {{is one of}} the most popular types of packaging all over the world. This packaging device is able to fulfil a huge number of requirements of the logistic process, during the phases of handling, shipping and storage. In addition to this, corrugated packaging is easily machinable, so it is also suitable for special supply chains and products. These special needs include the requirement to fit to the inner measurements of the shipping device, e. g. the shipping container. This is particularly expected in case of less than container-load (LTL) shipments, where the shipping cost is usually based on the required area (m 2) or cubic capacity (m 3) of the container, so the useful filling of the shipping device is a very strong advantage. Naturally, this is easily solvable with different CFB boxes which have different heights, but this way the user needs to stock a high variety of boxes, requires a good relationship and cooperation between the parties and also a proper knowledge of product organisation in each box version. The multi-depth corrugated boxes are a suitable solution for resolving this problem. These boxes are creased at multiple intervals, so they are easily cuttable to the desired various heights. But the pre-scored lines can cause a loss of the compression strength capability of the box and thereby can lead to damages. The aim of this paper is to determine the effect of multiple creasing lines on the compression strength of the CFB box. This paper does not focus on the effect of either different creasing parameter, such as depth and width, nor on the distances between each creasing. Based on the test results, the compression strengths are decreased nearly significantly due to the additional creasing line(s) ...|$|R

LCA tool is used to assess and compare their environmental performance in all phase of their life cycle but more focusing on end of life phase.   This study gives more emphasis to waste treatment options such as incineration, landfilling and recycling. Three different end of life scenarios {{have been used in}} this study such as 100 % incineration, 100 % landfilling and 100 % recycling.   This study includes results of all the phases of all three types of pallets which are analysed in this report. More detailed results could be seen in excel sheets. Results of impact analysis tells that landfilling contributes to 14793 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential in case of corrugated pallets. Incineration contributes to 12148. 6 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Recycling contributes to 7136 Kg CO 2 of global warming. Re-load pallets show the major contribution of global warming is from landfilling approx 813. 2 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Recycling and incineration contribute to 438 Kg CO 2 and 726. 7 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential respectively. In plastic case incineration contributes the most to global warming approximate 1183. 8 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential. Landfilling and recycling contribute almost the same approximate 932. 6 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential and 924. 5 Kg CO 2 of global warming potential respectively. Acidification impact show corrugated pallets cause high emissions when they are treat with landfilling and give negative values of incineration. In Eutriphication impact corrugated pallets are considered better in a sence they are inbetween 150 and 100 kg of PO- 4. Re-load pallets give the least values when they are applied to different end of life scenarios.   According to the results recycling could be replace other waste treatment options because of less impact through out the end of life. Secondly, Reload pallets represent a environmental friendly product which can be improved more after this study. Lack of LCI data is the major problem in this study because it is not easily accessible and it is very time consuming part of this study. Results might be different if more data is available.   This study can be helpful for further study, for instance more replaceable scenarios will show different results for all three types of pallets.

40|$|Models of the {{nonlinear}} creep {{behavior of}} paper, {{and of the}} global buckling, local buckling and creep buckling of corrugated board have been developed. The studies of creep and buckling were limited to climate conditions with constant relative humidity. First the short-term elastic buckling of corrugated board panels was studied. Then an appropriate creep equation, based on the Schapery representation, for liner and fluting materials was developed and implemented in a finite element code to study creep buckling and time to failure of a corrugated board panel axially loaded in compression. Experimental tensile creep-recovery tests of 300 g/m 2 kraftliner (used for the <b>facing</b> of <b>corrugated</b> boards) and 150 g/m 2 semi-chemical testliner (used for the fluting) at 50, 70 and 90 %RH were made by a special designed tensile creep tester. Compression creep-recovery tests at 50 %RH was made using a compression creep tester developed at STFI. For the short-term loading case, the experimental global buckling and postbuckling deformation performance of a corrugated board panel {{was found to be}} in good agreement with the performance predicted by FE-calculation. The calculated local buckling load was however almost 2. 5 times higher than the experimentally observed local buckling load in the panel. This discrepancy between the experimental and calculated local buckling load was most probably due to development of global buckling before local buckling of the panel. For the long-term loading case, the Schapery equation was found to give a good representation of the creep behavior of the facing and fluting material and enabled reasonably accurate predictions of the creep behavior of corrugated board. The Schapery representation for paper was implemented in the finite element codes Ansys and Abaqus. In Ansys, the Schapery representation was described by using stress-strain isochrounes and failure of the material was considered by using a Tsai-Wu failure criterion based on a time independent failure strain in the CD and MD at each layer. This model with isochrounes and a material failure criterion was found to be suitable for calculating failure load for a given time to failure. In the calculations made by the finite element code Abaqus no simplification was made of the Schapery representation and no material failure criterion was used. This model is more accurate than the model with isochrounes stress-strain curves {{in the sense that the}} influence of stress redistribution on the creep is considered. The model is therefore suitable to study the creep strains of a corrugated board structure as function of time, both the in-plane strains and pre-failure out-of-plane displacements. The creep buckling analysis was verified by tests. It was found that the experimental out-of-plane displacement of the mid-node of a panel under compression load was in good agreement with the calculated out-of-plane displacement...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 145 - 149). Corrugated {{board is}} a composite sandwich type material used in the packaging industry worldwide. In the design of corrugated boxes, the stacking strength is an important design parameter. Current research shows that box failure is inﬂuenced by the ﬂexural rigidities of the panel and its transverse shear rigidities. McKinlay proposed a new method to measure the MD transverse shear stiffness of corrugated board. This research was aimed at designing a ﬁxture to perform the MD shear test and to evaluate its performance. In addition, the properties that inﬂuence box strength were to be investigated. These properties were then {{to be used in}} improved box strength predictions. It was found that the designed MD shear ﬁxture was able to measure the transverse shear stiffness of corrugated board in the MD direction {{with a high degree of}} accuracy and reproducibility. This method was much easier to perform than the standard block shear test method and also much quicker. This was a very important factor considering the application of this testing method in a research and development environment. In addition, the stiffness test exhibited good possibilities for use as a quality control tool. Extensive testing showed that the material used in the manufacture of corrugated board had a strong inﬂuence on board and box strength. In addition, it was found that the separation of the <b>faces</b> in a <b>corrugated</b> board structure had an inﬂuence on the strength and stability of the box. Factors such as the manufacturing process and board structure were also found to have an effect on box strength. Box strength predictions were performed using the methods available in the literature. These predictions had good correlation with the experimental box compression values. It was shown that box strength can be accurately predicted from liner and ﬂuting properties and this capability is an important tool in box strength design...|$|R
40|$|Overbreak {{and damage}} to rock walls {{is one of}} the most serious {{problems}} encountered in blasting operations. Several techniques have been developed to control the undesirable effects of rock blasting. These techniques are collectively known as wall-control blasting methods. The stress distribution around pressurized holes has been numerically evaluated, in order to analyze the mechanism of wall-control blasting methods. The effect of blast geometry and the role of discontinuity on this stress field has also been studied in detail. The results obtained by numerical modelling have been verified by controlled blasting experiments, and further supported by analysis of existing roadcuts on a large scale. It was found that the mechanism of wall-control blast can be explained by the collision and superposition of the stresses between the holes. A narrow fracture zone between the holes was produced by tensile stresses on the centreline. It is neither necessary nor realistic to assume onset of fractures at the midpoint between holes by reinforcement of the stresses from each hole. The analysis shows that a burden can be defined as being infinite when the ratio of that to the spacing is greater than unity. For pre-split blasting (infinite burden) in an isotropic and homogeneous material the hole separation could range up to 15 borehole diameters. The decoupling ratio between the explosive charge and the borehole diameter should be smaller than 0. 5. This ratio would generally be between 0. 2 and 0. 3 for pre-splitting (infinite burden), and between 0. 3 and 0. 4 in the presence of a free face. A discontinuity parallel to the free face and located at the back of the holes causes high stress levels between the discontinuity and the boreholes, resulting is a shattered one in this region. The presence of a similar discontinuity at the front of the holes leads to considerable overbreak and development of an undamaged "hump" of rock between holes. The effect of a discontinuity oriented normal to the centreline at the midpoint between holes has minimal effect on the blast results. As the angle of the discontinuity with the free face decreases from 90 $ sp circ,$ the damage zone between the holes and the discontinuity increases, and the shape of the final wall changes from a smooth <b>face</b> to a <b>corrugated</b> shape. A closed-discontinuity or an open discontinuity cemented with strong filling materials has little effect on the results of the blast. However, as the width of the discontinuity increases, the size of the damage zone also increases. An open discontinuity, 50 mm wide or more, plays a role similar to a free face. In roadcut blast design, hole deviation is a key parameter in determining the quality of the face. However, consistent hole deviation in the same direction has minimal effect in the result of the blast. This type of deviation is usually associated with bedded rocks, with alternating bands of soft and hard rock on the face. The degree of deviation is dependent, amongst other factors, on orientation, thickness, frequency and the position of these bands...|$|R
