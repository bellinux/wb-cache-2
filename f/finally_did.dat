5|$|The many negative, untruthful stories bothered Earp a great deal, and {{he finally}} decided to tell his own story. Earp also tried to track J.M. Scanland, {{the author of the}} LA Times article, and extract a written {{retraction}} from him, which he <b>finally</b> <b>did</b> in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The role of Lord W. C. Jackson {{was portrayed}} by C. R. Parthiban, while M. R. Santhanam played the minister, Thanapathi Sivasubramaniam Pillai. Kattabomman's {{daughter}} in the film, Meena, was a fictional character created by Krishnasamy. She was based on Krishnasamy's own daughter, Mynavathi, who {{died when she was}} five years old. Krishnasamy initially refused to include the scene involving Meena's death as it reminded him of his daughter, but <b>finally</b> <b>did</b> so reluctantly. The character was played by Baby Kanchana.|$|E
5|$|By the 1940s, budget {{concerns}} and national trends {{made it clear}} that Louisville Girls High School and duPont Manual would merge into one coeducational school. They <b>finally</b> <b>did</b> so in September 1950 and remained in the old Louisville Girls High School building. This fusion of institutions resulted in the birth of the modern duPont Manual High School – dropping 'Training' from its previous name. The same school building remains in use today, although two major additions have since been made. The middle school located on the building's first floor became Manly Junior High and moved to Manual's old building at Brook and Oak.|$|E

5|$|Following {{training}} exercises {{with the}} 32nd U-boat Flotilla from 30 September 1944 to 15 February 1945, U-2336 began her first voyages as a front boat of the 4th U-boat Flotilla on 16 February 1945. However, on 18 February 1945 {{she was involved}} in a collision with , another Type XXIII U-boat, off Heiligendamm on the Baltic coast. U-2344 was sunk, with the loss of 11 of her crew. It took about two months for U-2336 to actually leave her home port of Kiel, which she <b>finally</b> <b>did</b> on 18 April 1945 under a new commander, Kapitänleutnant Emil Klusmeier. Following five days of traveling across the straits of Kattegat and Skagerrak, U-2336 reached Larvik, Norway on 24 April 1945; which was to be her new home port {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Krueger {{accepted}} {{reports of}} a Japanese counterattack at Saidor, and sent reinforcements in response, but the attack did not eventuate. Because the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation, he was initially reluctant to authorize it to block the trails behind the American beachhead. When he <b>finally</b> <b>did</b> so, it was too late. The retreating Japanese made good their escape, thereby defeating {{the whole purpose of}} the operation. The next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign in February 1944, played out differently. Based on Fifth Air Force reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force of the islands. Krueger sent in the Alamo Scouts, who confirmed that the islands were still well-defended.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the famous}} Modernist writers who {{spent time in}} Paris, Ernest Hemingway never made an {{appearance}} at the salon. James Joyce came once or twice but didn't care for it. Marcel Proust never attended a Friday, though he did come to 20, Rue Jacob once to talk with Barney about lesbian culture whilst doing research for In Search of Lost Time. His visit was delayed repeatedly owing to his poor health, and when the meeting <b>finally</b> <b>did</b> happen he was too nervous {{to bring up the}} subject he had come to talk about.|$|E

5|$|The {{judge said}} there were three crucial points, in no {{particular}} order. Did the jury believe Julie Mugford or Jeremy Bamber? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, {{she could not have}} fired it. <b>Finally,</b> <b>did</b> Nevill call Bamber {{in the middle of the}} night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Bamber's story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.|$|E
5|$|As for Governor General Prevost, {{who often}} clashed with Brock, he {{remained}} in command of all British forces until after the Battle of Plattsburgh, in 1814. The battle {{was intended to be}} a joint naval/infantry attack, but Prevost did not commit his forces until after the naval battle had nearly ended. When he <b>finally</b> <b>did</b> attack, his forces proved unable to cross the Saranac River bridge, which was held by a small group of American regulars under the command of the recently promoted John E. Wool. Despite a heavy advantage in manpower, Prevost finally retreated upon hearing of the failure of the naval attack. For his failure at Plattsburgh, Prevost was recalled to England to face an inquiry, and a naval court martial determined that the blame for the loss at Plattsburgh primarily rested with Prevost. Prevost's health failed him, and he died in early 1816.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire from the opposite bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it <b>finally</b> <b>did</b> get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire from the opposite bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E
