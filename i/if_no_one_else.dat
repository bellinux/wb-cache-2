A player can steal a discard to form a chow from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs <b>if</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> needs the tile to make Pongs, Kongs or win.|$|E
25|$|Discriminatory {{land use}} {{policies}} {{had been introduced}} prior to 1929, which made it such that clergy who wanted land plots for private cultivation needed special permission and that this permission could only be given <b>if</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> requested the land for use, and if such a request did arise the state could confiscate the land from the clergyman {{and give it to}} the person who requested it. The clergy also had no priority in claim to the land that belonged to the Church prior to 1917. In 1928 it was made illegal for clergy to join co-operative and collective farms. In addition there were no laws that limited the rights of local governments to refuse land plots to clergy arbitrarily. All of this legislation contributed to {{a situation in which the}} clergy had no land to cultivate.|$|E

25|$|In early August, Hansen {{suggested}} to Rigler that he take custody of Genie if authorities rejected Butler's application, and Rigler initially {{balked at the}} idea but decided to talk it over with his wife, Marilyn; Marilyn had graduate training {{as a social worker}} and had just completed a graduate degree in human development, and had previously worked in nursery schools and Head Start Programs. The Riglers had three adolescent children of their own, which Jay Shurley said made them consider themselves more suitable guardians for Genie than Butler. They ultimately decided that, <b>if</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> would, they were willing to temporarily care for Genie until another suitable foster home became available. Rigler acknowledged the proposed arrangement would clearly put him in a dual relationship with her, but Children's Hospital and authorities decided that, in the absence of other adequate options, they would consent to making the Riglers Genie's temporary foster parents.|$|E
25|$|The setup {{involves}} an auctioneer who volunteers {{to auction off}} a dollar bill with the following rule: the bill goes to the winner; however, the second-highest bidder also loses the amount that they bid. The winner can get a dollar for a mere 5 cents, but only <b>if</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> enters into the bidding war. The second-highest bidder is the biggest loser by paying the top amount they bid without getting anything back. The game begins {{with one of the}} players bidding 5 cents (the minimum), hoping to make a 95-cent profit. They can be outbid by another player bidding 10 cents, as a 90-cent profit is still desirable. Similarly, another bidder may bid 15cents, making an 85-cent profit. Meanwhile, the second bidder may attempt to convert their loss of 10 cents into a gain of 80 cents by bidding 20 cents, and so on. Every player has a choice of either paying for nothing or bidding 5 cents more on the dollar. Any bid beyond the value of a dollar is a loss for all bidders alike. A series of rational bids will reach and ultimately surpass one dollar as the bidders seek to minimize their losses. If the first bidder bids 95 cents, and the second bidder bids one dollar (for no net gain or loss), the first bidder stands to lose ninety five cents unless he bids $1.05, in which case they rationally bid more than the value of the item for sale (the dollar) in order to reduce their losses to only five cents. Bidding continues with the second highest bidder always losing more than the highest bidder and therefore always trying to become the high bidder. Only the auctioneer gets to profit in the end.|$|E
500|$|To Freeman Dyson, {{one thing}} at least was clear: Sin'ichirō Tomonaga, Schwinger and Feynman {{understood}} {{what they were talking}} about even <b>if</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> did, but had not published anything. Moreover, he was convinced that Feynman's formulation was easier to understand, and ultimately managed to convince Oppenheimer that this was the case. Dyson published a paper in 1949, which added new rules to Feynman's that told how to implement renormalization. Feynman was prompted to publish his ideas in the Physical Review in a series of papers over three years. His 1948 papers on [...] "A Relativistic Cut-Off for Classical Electrodynamics" [...] attempted to explain what he had been unable to get across at Pocono. His 1949 paper on [...] "The Theory of Positrons" [...] addressed the Schrödinger equation and Dirac equation, and introduced what is now called the Feynman propagator. Finally, in papers on the [...] "Mathematical Formulation of the Quantum Theory of Electromagnetic Interaction" [...] in 1950 and [...] "An Operator Calculus Having Applications in Quantum Electrodynamics" [...] in 1951, he developed the mathematical basis of his ideas, derived familiar formulae and advanced new ones.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars who {{doubt the}} {{scientific}} {{validity of the}} notion of [...] "institutional facts" [...] include Noam Chomsky, for whom language is not social. In Chomsky's view, language is a natural object (a component of the individual brain) and its study, therefore, a branch of natural science. In explaining the origin of language, scholars in this intellectual camp invoke non-social developments— in Chomsky's case, a random genetic mutation. Chomsky argues that language might exist inside the brain of a single mutant gorilla even <b>if</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> believed in it, even <b>if</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> existed apart from the mutant— and even if the gorilla in question remained unaware of its existence, never actually speaking. In the opposite philosophical camp are those who, in the tradition of Ferdinand de Saussure, argue that if no one believed in words or rules, they simply would not exist. These scholars, correspondingly, regard language as essentially institutional, concluding that linguistics should be considered a topic within social science. In explaining the evolutionary emergence of language, scholars in this intellectual camp tend to invoke profound changes in social relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Family {{traditions are}} also lost or {{modified}} {{in response to}} difficult events within the family. This is obvious {{when one of the}} tradition bearers has died. <b>If</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>else</b> steps up to own that tradition, a hole is left in the celebration and this tradition is lost. In a divorce there is also frequently the loss of a parent no longer available to play his or her role in the established traditions. In response to this event, one family decided to change the traditions. The customary tall Christmas tree decorated by the (missing) tall father was traded in for a short tree which the children could decorate. Ornaments were discarded and new ones purchased. The toy train was no longer set up. These became the new traditions for the Christmas celebration, modified to support and tell the new family story.|$|E

2500|$|The Court's {{observation}} {{that there was}} no substantive difference between allowing the State to amend its answer and simply dismissing sua sponte was characterized by Scalia as [...] "what appears to be the chief ground of its decision." [...] Scalia argued that if there was truly no [...] "dispositive difference" [...] between the alternatives, [...] "the natural conclusion would be that there is no compelling reason to disregard the Civil Rules. [...] Legislatively enacted rules are surely entitled to more respect than this apparent presumption that, when nothing substantial hangs on the point, they do not apply as written." [...] At a minimum, Scalia believed it [...] "a nontrivial value in itself" [...] to [...] "observe the formalities of our adversary system" [...] by requiring the State to amend its own pleading. [...] Scalia also observed that in contrast to the [...] "novel regime" [...] adopted by the majority, there is already a well-developed body of law regarding whether a party should have leave to amend a pleading.

[...] When the assistants insisted {{that this was the}} will of the emperor, he stated, [...] "If this is true, people will laugh to death." [...] When the edict announcing his chancellorship arrived the next day, along with congratulating guests, Zheng was confounded, stating to himself, [...] "If the Fifth Zheng, the xiehou writer, becomes chancellor, what does this say about the current state of governance?" [...] He submitted several petitions declining the commission, but the emperor took no heed of them, so he felt compelled to report to his post as a chancellor.|$|E
