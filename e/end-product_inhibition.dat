On the contrary oleic acid remained in capsules during the back-extraction when an extractant was saturated with oleic acid. Nevertheless the presence of oleic acid in the back-extraction solution demanded more purification steps (precipitation, centrifugation and filtration). Oleic acid was removed because it prevents crystallization of geldanamycin. Therefore geldanamycin was crystallized and the end product was highly purified.

Current studies define Insig proteins as {{essential elements of}} this feedback system in mouse liver. In cultured cells, Insig proteins are required for sterol-mediated inhibition of the processing of sterol regulatory element–binding proteins (SREBPs) to their nuclear forms. We produced mice with germline disruption of the Insig 2 gene and Cre-mediated disruption of the Insig 1 gene in liver. On a chow diet, these double-knockout mice overaccumulated cholesterol and triglycerides in liver. Despite this accumulation, levels of nuclear SREBPs and mRNAs for SREBP target genes in lipogenic pathways were not reduced. Whereas cholesterol feeding reduced nuclear SREBPs and lipogenic mRNAs in wild-type mice, this feedback response was severely blunted in the double-knockout mice, and synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids was not repressed.

30|$|The present work {{showed that}} the HYBRID design, i.e. a high {{temperature}} enzymatic hydrolysis step prior to fermentation, gave a higher overall glucan conversion compared to a 96  hours SSCF process (Table  2). This is well in-line with results reported by Cannella and Jorgensen for pretreated wheat straw (Cannella and Jørgensen [2013]), and supports their claim that commercial enzyme mixtures available today are less end-product inhibited and exhibit improved long time temperature stability. It deserves to be pointed out, that the advantage comes from the high temperature for enzymatic hydrolysis. If SSCF and pure hydrolysis is compared at the same (permissible) temperature, e.g. 34 ˚C as done in this study, a better glucan conversion is indeed obtained for the SSCF case (Table  2 –first and last columns). This confirms that SSCF most likely still gives a reduced <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition</b> of the enzymes.

40|$|The {{signaling}} {{functions of}} dopamine require a finely tuned regulatory network for rapid induction and suppression of output. A key target of regulation is the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis, which is activated by phosphorylation and modulated by {{the availability of}} its cofactor, tetrahydrobiopterin. The first enzyme in the cofactor synthesis pathway, GTP cyclohydrolase I, is activated by phosphorylation and inhibited by tetrahydrobiopterin. We previously reported that deficits in GTP cyclohydrolase activity in Drosophila heterozygous for mutant alleles of the gene encoding this enzyme led to tightly corresponding diminution of in vivo tyrosine hydroxylase activity {{that could not be}} rescued by exogenous cofactor. We also found that the two enzymes could be coimmunoprecipitated from tissue extracts and proposed functional interactions between the enzymes that extended beyond provision of cofactor by one pathway for another. Here, we confirm the physical association of these enzymes, identifying interacting regions in both, and we demonstrate that their association can be regulated by phosphorylation. The functional consequences of the interaction include an increase in GTP cyclohydrolase activity, with concomitant protection from <b>end-product</b> feedback <b>inhibition.</b> In vivo, this effect would in turn provide sufficient cofactor when demand for catecholamine synthesis is greatest. The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase is also increased by this interaction, in excess of the stimulation resulting from phosphorylation alone. Vmax is elevated, with no change in Km.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The energy {{charge of}} the adenylate system, half of {{the average number of}} anhydride-bound phos-phate groups per adenine moiety, has been {{proposed}} as a metabolic regulatory parameter. For several reactions that participate in biosynthesis or other adenosine triphosphate utilizing sequences, plots of enzyme ac-tivity against energy charge have positive slopes that increase with charge; thus these curves (type U) are concave upward and steep in the region of high charge. <b>End-product</b> feedback <b>inhibition</b> of the type demon-strated for many biosynthetic regulatory enzymes must be reflected in a decrease in the slope of such curves on the addition of the end product. The area between the curve representing absence of end product and that representing a saturating level of it should indicate the operational range of the regulatory enzyme. Within this range, if either end-product concentration or energy charge is constant the enzyme will respond only to variation in the other; but it may be expected that both parameters affect the behavior of the enzyme in the intact cell. For several reactions that participate in adenosine triphosphate regenerating sequences, plots of S everal enzymes that are involved in energy-yielding sequences, or that catalyze reactions at metabolic branch points, are affected by adenine nucleotides. The pattern of the responses suggests that they participate in the regulatory interactions that must underlie orderly metabolic integration. Thus Krebs (1964; Gevers and Krebs, 1966) suggested that the level of AMP 1 may be an important factor in determining whether glycolysis or gluconeogenesis will predominate, and we (Hatha-way and Atkinson, 1963; Ramaiah et a/., 1964; Atkin-son, 1965, 1966) proposed that the balance among con-centrations of the adenine nucleotides may be a major regulatory factor at every point where a metabolite is partitioned between energy-yielding and energy-de-manding or energy-storing processes.

40|$|Abstract Background Alpha-isopropylmalate synthase (α-IPMS) is the {{key enzyme}} that catalyzes the first {{committed}} step in the leucine biosynthetic pathway. The gene encoding α-IPMS in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, leuA, is polymorphic due to the insertion of 57 -bp repeat units referred to as Variable Number of Tandem Repeats (VNTR). The role of the VNTR found within the M. tuberculosis genome is unclear. To investigate {{the role of the}} VNTR in leuA, we compared two α-IPMS proteins with different numbers of amino acid repeats, one with two copies and the other with 14 copies. We have cloned leuA with 14 copies of the repeat units into the pET 15 b expression vector with a His 6 -tag at the N-terminus, as was previously done for the leuA gene with two copies of the repeat units. Results The recombinant His 6 -α-IPMS proteins with two and 14 copies (α-IPMS- 2 CR and α-IPMS- 14 CR, respectively) of the repeat units were purified by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and gel filtration. Both enzymes were found to be dimers by gel filtration. Both enzymes work well at pH values of 7 – 8. 5 and temperatures of 37 – 42 °C. However, α-IPMS- 14 CR tolerates pH values and temperatures outside of this range better than α-IPMS- 2 CR does. α-IPMS- 14 CR has higher affinity than α-IPMS- 2 CR for the two substrates, α-ketoisovalerate and acetyl CoA. Furthermore, α-IPMS- 2 CR was feedback inhibited by the end product l-leucine, whereas α-IPMS- 14 CR was not. Conclusion The differences in the kinetic properties and the l-leucine feedback inhibition between the two M. tuberculosis α-IPMS proteins containing low and high numbers of VNTR indicate that a large VNTR insertion affects protein structure and function. Demonstration of l-leucine binding to α-IPMS- 14 CR would confirm whether or not α-IPMS- 14 CR responds to <b>end-product</b> feedback <b>inhibition.</b> </p...|$|R

Here, we investigate the molecular targets of high glucose-induced damage in cardiac progenitor cells (CPCs) from murine and human hearts and attempt safeguarding CPC viability and function through reactivation of the pentose phosphate pathway. METHODS AND RESULTS: Type- 1 diabetes was induced by streptozotocin. CPC abundance {{was determined by}} flow cytometry. Proliferating CPCs were identified in situ by immunostaining for the proliferation marker Ki 67. Diabetic hearts showed marked reduction in CPC abundance and proliferation when compared with controls. Moreover, Sca- 1 (pos) CPCs isolated from hearts of diabetic mice displayed reduced activity of key enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD), and transketolase, increased levels of superoxide and advanced glucose <b>end-products</b> (AGE), and <b>inhibition</b> of the Akt/Pim- 1 /Bcl- 2 signalling pathway. Similarly, culture of murine CPCs or human CD 105 (pos) progenitor cells in high glucose inhibits the pentose phosphate and pro-survival signalling pathways, leading to the activation of apoptosis. In vivo and in vitro supplementation with benfotiamine reactivates the pentose phosphate pathway and rescues CPC availability and function. This benefit is abrogated by either G 6 PD silencing by small interfering RNA (siRNA) or Akt inhibition by dominant-negative Akt. CONCLUSION: We provide new evidence of {{the negative impact of}} diabetes and high glucose on mechanisms controlling CPC redox state and survival.

Process Biochemistry, 21 (5), 131 - 147 App 2 : Gutierrez, N. A. & Maddox, I. S. (1987). Role of Chemotaxis in Solvent Production by Clostridium acetobutylicum. Applied and Enviromental Microbiology, 53 (8), 1924 - 1927. The motility of Clostridium acetobutylicum P 262 and {{its relationship}} to solventogenesis were investigated. Motility was monitored in a typical batch fermentation process using sulphuric acid casein whey permeate as substrate. The motile behaviour of C. acetobutylicum was characterized by "runs" wherein the cells were observed to swim in a long, smooth line, then the cells "tumbled" by thrashing around for a few seconds before running again. The "runs" were particularly associated with the early phase of sugar utilization and acid production, while "tumbles" were associated with the onset of solventogenesis. During solvent production, the cells tumbled more frequently and the runs progressively became shorter and slower. The proportion of cells in the culture which exhibited motility increased to almost 100 % up to 13 h after inoculation, but decreased considerably after this time. Assays for positive chemotaxis (chemoattraction) and negative chemotaxis (chemorepulsion) were performed to identify the chemoeffectors of C. acetobutylicum. Motile cells of C. acetobutylicum were observed to migrate towards glucose, galactose, and lactose. These sugars were identified as attractants. Acetate and butyrate elicited a dual response. Cells were repelled from the dissociated form and attracted towards the undissociated form above a minimum threshold concentration. Chemoattraction to butyric acid was observed at a threshold concentration of 9 x 10 - 2 M which is similar to the concentration of undissociated butyric acid inside the cell (1. 3 x 10 - 2 M) at which solventogenesis is reported to be initiated, suggesting that the intracellular butyric acid concentration is the likely switch for solventogenesis to commence. The solvents acetone, butanol and ethanol were identified as repellents. The behavioural response of C. acetobutylicum towards the sugars, acids and solvents demonstrates that the motility observed during fermentation is a chemotactic response. Chemotaxis appears to provide survival advantage to C. acetobutylicum. A non-motile mutant was isolated by mutagenesis using ethyl methane sulfonate. This mutant was morphologically indistinguishable from the motile parent strain, such that it possesses flagella in typical number and shape as those of the parent, and is capable of producing clostridial forms and endospores. This type of mutant is a paralyzed mutant and the mutation may be a defect in any of the genes that code for flagellar rotation. The non-motile mutant was capable of solvent production suggesting that motility is not a regulatory mechanism for the switch to solvent production, but merely a behavioural chemotactic response. However, the maximum butanol concentration achieved, the initial rate of butanol production, the yield, and the sugar utilization observed with the mutant were poorer than those of the parent strain. These confirm the positive relationship between motile, chemotactic cultures and solvent production. The low butanol production by the non-motile mutant suggests that the mutant has a lower butanol tolerance than does the parent. Inhibition studies have shown that both growth and solvent production of C. acetobutylicum are subject to <b>end-product</b> toxicity. Growth <b>inhibition</b> studies confirmed that the non-motile mutant was less tolerant to solvents than was the parent. A deficiency in membrane-bound ATPase activity was observed with the non-motile mutant but not in the parent strain. This deficiency in ATPase activity, lack of motility, and lower butanol tolerance may explain the low butanol production by the mutant. On a percentage basis, greater inhibition of solvent production was observed in the parent than in the mutant suggesting that butanol toxicity during the solvent production phase is more profound in the presence of another target site (i. e. ATPase) in addition to the cell membrane. It was further suggested that during growth, butanol inhibition due to membrane disruption was more important than inhibition of ATPase. Thus, chemotaxis prevents C. acetobutylicum from being confined in a toxic situation. Motile cells are more solventogenic because they can chemotactically respond to changes in their environment, and are less susceptible to product inhibition...|$|R

30|$|During bioconversion, polysaccharides undergo {{hydrolysis}} by {{an array}} of cell wall degrading enzymes. However, a major bottleneck in making these processes efficient is that plant cell walls have evolved to resist microbial and enzymatic deconstruction - a factor collectively known as “biomass recalcitrance”. Thus, rate-limiting steps in the bioconversion of lignocelluloses are the crystalline recalcitrance of cellulose and {{the limited number of}} cellulases i.e. all cellulolytic strains identified are low in one or more type of glycoside hydrolases (GH) required for efficient cellulose hydrolysis (endo-/exo-glucanases, β-glucanases). In attempts to improve the feasibility of the bioconversion of lignocellulose to biofuel, enzymes must have high adsorption capabilities, high catalytic efficiencies, high thermal stability and low <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition</b> [28]. In addition, some microorganisms secrete either endoglucanase or β-glucosidase (components of cellulase complex).

Trichoderma and Aspergillus have been the organisms of choice for industrial production of cellulases but they are subjected to tight induction – regulation mechanisms. Moreover, there are several limitations in achieving higher saccharification yields using these enzymes because of different types of inhibitions experienced.

The data support the conclusion that end product inhibition and repression collaborate to ensure maximal alkaline phosphatase activity in vivo during culmination. Exogenous adenosine and deoxyadenosine increase the alkaline phos-phatase levels in the sorocarps...|$|E
40|$|Over-dependence {{on fossil}} fuel has spurred {{research}} on alternative energy. Inedible plant {{materials such as}} grass and corn stover represent abundant renewable natural resources that can be transformed into biofuel. Problems in enzymatic conversion of biomass to sugars {{include the use of}} incomplete synergistic enzymes, <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition,</b> and adsorption and loss of enzymes necessitating their use in large quantities. Technova Corporation will develop a defined consortium of natural microorganisms that will efficiently break down biomass to energy-rich soluble sugars, and convert them to cleaner-burning ethanol fuel. The project will also develop a novel biocatalytic hybrid reactor system dedicated to this bioprocess, which embodies recent advances in nanotechnology. NREL will participate to develop a continuous fermentation process...|$|E
40|$|Acid {{phosphatase}} V of Aspergillus nidulans was purified by {{ammonium sulfate}} precipitation, gel filtration, and ion-exchange chromatography. The enzyme demonstrated a charge microheterogeneity on starch and acrylamide gel electrophoresis, but {{proved to be}} homogeneous on ultracentrifugation and gel filtration. Phosphatase V {{was found to be}} a classic acid orthophosphoric monoester phosphohydrolase, and it cleaved p-nitrophenylphosphate, glucose- 6 -phosphate, and uridine- 5 ′-monophosphate at maximal rates. It was inhibited by fluoride, borate, and molybdate ions, and demonstrated <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition</b> by inorganic phosphate. Metallic ions or cofactors were not required for activity. The molecular weight was estimated to be 100, 000, the S 20,w was calculated to be 4. 1, and the pH optimum was found to be 6. 1...|$|E
40|$|Extractive {{fermentation}} is {{a technique}} {{that can be used}} to reduce <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition</b> by removing fermentation products in situ or in an external recycle loop. A model is presented for fermentation with continuous lactic acid removal by extraction utilizing chemical complexation. The model is formulated considering the kinetics of cell growth and the equilibrium distribution of lactic acid between aqueous and organic phases. Simulations have been carried out for different sets of operating conditions. The choice of pH balances faster kinetics at higher pH against lower product concentrations in the solvent and more difficult regeneration. A key need is for liquid extractants or solid sorbents combining stronger uptake ability with economical regeneration and satisfactory biocompatibility...|$|E
40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} are industrially important microorganisms recognized for their fermentative ability mostly in their probiotic benefits {{as well as}} lactic acid production for various applications. Nevertheless, lactic acid fermentation often suffers <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition</b> which decreases the cell growth rate. The inhibition of lactic acid {{is due to the}} solubility of the undissociated lactic acid within the cytoplasmic membrane and insolubility of dissociated lactate, which causes acidification of cytoplasm and failure of proton motive forces. This phenomenon influences the transmembrane pH gradient and decreases the amount of energy available for cell growth. In general, the restriction imposed by lactic acid on its fermentation can be avoided by extractive fermentation techniques, which can also be exploited for product recovery...|$|E
40|$|Lovatt et al. (1979 Plant Physiol 64 : 562 - 569) have {{previously}} demonstrated that <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition</b> {{functions as a}} mechanism regulating {{the activity of the}} orotic acid pathway in intact cells of roots excised from 2 -day-old squash plants (Cucurbita pepo L. cv Early Prolific Straightneck). Uridine (0. 5 millimolar final concentration) or one of its metabolites inhibited the incorporation of NaH 14 CO 3, but not [14 C]carbamylaspartate or [14 C]orotic acid, into uridine nucleotides (ΣUMP). Thus, regulation of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis was demonstrated to occur at {{one or both of the}} first two reactions of the orotic acid pathway, those catalyzed by carbamylphosphate synthetase (CPSase) and aspartate carbamyltransferase (ACTase). The results of the present study provide evidence that ACTase alone is the site of feedback control by added uridine or one of its metabolites. Evidence demonstrating regulation of the orotic acid pathway by <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition</b> at ACTase, but not at CPSase, includes the following observations: (a) addition of uridine (0. 5 millimolar final concentration) inhibited the incorporation of NaH 14 CO 3 into ΣUMP by 80 % but did not inhibit the incorporation of NaH 14 CO 3 into arginine; (b) inhibition of the orotate pathway by added uridine was not reversed by supplying exogenous ornithine (5 millimolar final concentration), while the incorporation of NaH 14 CO 3 into arginine was stimulated more than 15 -fold when both uridine and ornithine were added; (c) incorporation of NaH 14 CO 3 into arginine increased, with or without added ornithine when the de novo pyrimidine pathway was inhibited by added uridine; and (d) in assays employing cell-free extracts prepared from 2 -day-old squash roots, the activity of ACTase, but not CPSase, was inhibited by added pyrimidine nucleotides...|$|E
40|$|Lenz-Majewski {{syndrome}} (LMS) is a syndrome {{of intellectual}} disability and multiple congenital anomalies that features generalized craniotubular hyperostosis. By using whole-exome sequencing and selecting variants {{consistent with the}} predicted dominant de novo etiology of LMS, we identified causative heterozygous missense mutations in PTDSS 1, which encodes phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PSS 1). PSS 1 {{is one of two}} enzymes involved in the production of phosphatidylserine. Phosphatidylserine synthesis was increased in intact fibroblasts from affected individuals, and <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition</b> of PSS 1 by phosphatidylserine was markedly reduced. Therefore, these mutations cause a gain-of-function effect associated with regulatory dysfunction of PSS 1. We have identified LMS as the first human disease, to our knowledge, caused by disrupted phosphatidylserine metabolism. Our results point to an unexplored link between phosphatidylserine synthesis and bone metabolism...|$|E
40|$|The enzymatic {{degradation}} of polysaccharides to monosaccharides {{is an essential}} step in bioconversion processes of lignocellulosic materials. Alkali treated brewers spent grain {{was used as a}} model substrate for the study of cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis by Fusarium oxysporum enzyme extract. The results obtained showed that cellulose and hemicellulose conversions are not affected by the same factors, implementing different strategies for a successful bioconversion. Satisfactory cellulose conversion could be achieved by increasing the enzyme dosage in order to overcome the <b>end-product</b> <b>inhibition,</b> while the complexity of hemicellulose structure imposes the presence of specific enzyme activities in the enzyme mixture used. All the factors investigated were combined in a mathematical model describing and predicting alkali treated brewers spent grain conversion by F. oxysporum enzyme extract. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
