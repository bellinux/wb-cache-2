5|$|Nicolaus Copernicus, {{a son of}} a Toruń trader from Kraków, {{made many}} {{contributions}} to science and the arts. <b>His</b> <b>scientific</b> creativity was inspired at the University of Kraków, at the institution's height; he also studied at Italian universities later. Copernicus wrote Latin poetry, developed an economic theory, functioned as a cleric-administrator, political activist in Prussian sejmiks, and led the defense of Olsztyn against the forces of Albrecht Hohenzollern. As an astronomer, he worked on <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> theory for many years at Frombork, where he died.|$|E
50|$|<b>His</b> earlier <b>scientific</b> work dealt largely with {{subjects}} such as spectroscopy and electric discharges in gases. While at Munich, he conducted important, pioneer research of atmospheric electricity. <b>His</b> other <b>scientific</b> interests included solar physics, zodiacal light, lunar craters, atmospheric optics and the Earth's magnetic field.|$|R

5|$|Along with <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> fame, Newton's {{studies of}} the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies of Daniel, and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one {{traditionally}} accepted date.|$|E
5|$|Horsefield did not confine <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> {{interests}} to botany, as he also studied algebra, mensuration and astronomy. Charles Horsefield had also encouraged {{his son in}} the last pursuit, taking him to meet Robert Ward, an astronomer in Blackley who had a telescope. John Horsefield developed {{an interest in the}} subject {{to the extent that he}} constructed an orrery, much to the bewilderment of his neighbours.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn was renowned {{during his}} {{lifetime}} as a keyboard performer, both on the piano and on the organ.

5|$|Myers, born March 2, 1842, was of German {{descent and}} the son of Abram Myers and Ann Ela Myers. His birthplace was Fort Herkimer in New York state, but he grew up in the nearby town of Mohawk. Myers {{attended}} a school run by a scientist, which stimulated <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> curiosity. At school he became interested in the principles of electricity and all related matters.|$|E
5|$|A {{large part}} of Mercator's income came from the sales of his {{terrestrial}} and celestial globes. For sixty years they {{were considered to be}} the finest in the world, and they were sold in such great numbers that there are many surviving examples. This was a substantial enterprise involving making the spheres, printing the gores, building substantial stands, packing and distributing all over Europe. He was also renowned for <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> instruments, particularly his astrolabes and astronomical rings used to study the geometry of astronomy and astrology.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to continental Europe, Forster turned toward academia. He traveled to Paris {{to seek out}} a discussion with the American revolutionary Benjamin Franklin in 1777. He taught natural history at the Collegium Carolinum in the Ottoneum, Kassel (1778–84), and later at the Academy of Vilna (Vilnius University) (1784–87). In 1788, he became head librarian at the University of Mainz. Most of <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> work during this time consisted of essays on botany and ethnology, but he also prefaced and translated many books about travel and exploration, including a German translation of Cook's diaries.|$|E
5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer {{is remembered}} by his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E
5|$|As a student, Kincaid showed {{exceptional}} {{aptitude for}} the natural sciences and achieved national attention for <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> achievements. In 1897, while still an undergraduate, he accompanied David Starr Jordan to the Pribilof Islands {{as part of a}} study of seals undertaken by the American Fur Seal Commission. Back in Washington, Kincaid's interests focused more on insect life, and a report that year in the Boston Evening Transcript noted that he had discovered 41 new species of bees, including 22 of the genus Osmia. Theodore Dru Alison Cockerell, at the time one of America's leading entomologists, directed a portion of the sizable Kincaid bee collection to the Smithsonian Institution.|$|E

5|$|At age seven de Candolle {{contracted}} of {{a severe}} case of hydrocephalus, which significantly affected his childhood. Nevertheless, {{he is said}} to have had great aptitude for learning, distinguishing himself in school with his rapid acquisition of knowledge in classical and general literature and his ability to write fine poetry. In 1794, he began <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> studies at the Collège Calvin, where he studied under Jean Pierre Étienne Vaucher, who later inspired de Candolle to make botanical science the chief pursuit of his life.|$|E
5|$|Because The Assayer {{contains}} such {{a wealth}} of Galileo's ideas on how science should be practised, it {{has been referred to}} as <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> manifesto. Early in 1619, Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet, An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618, which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year. Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth, and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon, it must be farther away than the moon.|$|E
5|$|Charles Messier {{measured}} {{the position of}} the cluster and included it as M45 in his catalogue of comet-like objects, published in 1771. Along with the Orion Nebula and the Praesepe cluster, Messier's inclusion of the Pleiades has been noted as curious, as most of Messier's objects were much fainter and more easily confused with comets—something that seems scarcely possible for the Pleiades. One possibility is that Messier simply wanted to have a larger catalogue than <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> rival Lacaille, whose 1755 catalogue contained 42 objects, and so he added some bright, well-known objects to boost his list.|$|E

He is buried in Père Lachaise Cemetery. On his tomb is a simple obelisk erected by his wife, and a stone slab stating simply: Ici repose Jean-François Champollion, né à Figeac dept. du Lot le 23 décembre 1790, décédé à Paris le 4 mars 1832 (Here rests Jean-François Champollion, born at Figeac, Department of the Lot, on 23 December 1790, died at Paris on 4 March 1832).|$|E
5|$|Fermi {{was fond}} of {{pointing}} out that Alessandro Volta, working in his laboratory, could have {{had no idea where}} the study of electricity would lead. Fermi is generally remembered for his work on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, especially the creation of the first nuclear reactor, and the development of the first atomic and hydrogen bombs. <b>His</b> <b>scientific</b> work has stood the test of time. This includes his theory of beta decay, his work with non-linear systems, his discovery of the effects of slow neutrons, his study of pion-nucleon collisions, and his Fermi–Dirac statistics. His speculation that a pion was not a fundamental particle pointed the way towards the study of quarks and leptons.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 Marischal College {{merged with}} the {{neighbouring}} King's College to form the University of Aberdeen. There {{was no room for}} two professors of Natural Philosophy, so Maxwell, despite <b>his</b> <b>scientific</b> reputation, found himself laid off. He was unsuccessful in applying for Forbes's recently vacated chair at Edinburgh, the post instead going to Tait. Maxwell was granted the Chair of Natural Philosophy at King's College, London, instead. After recovering from a near-fatal bout of smallpox in 1860, Maxwell moved to London with his wife.|$|E
