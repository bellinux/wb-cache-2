5|$|Boston manager Art Ross {{predicted}} that Thompson, now 35, would {{play for the}} Red Wings {{for at least another}} five seasons; however, Thompson remained with the team for only two seasons before retiring from playing. The Red Wings posted a losing record <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> seasons, although they made the playoffs both times. Overall, Thompson appeared in 85 regular season games for Detroit, recording a 32–41–12 record, seven shutouts, and a 2.54goals-against average, and in 11 playoff games, posting a 5–6, with one shutout and a 2.41 goal-against average.|$|E
5|$|Duquesne {{was plagued}} by a few issues during the 2009 season. Most notable were the poor free-throw and 3-point {{shooting}} percentages. Duquesne was last in the Atlantic 10 <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> categories at 60.8% and 26.3% respectively. Despite their poor performance shooting from beyond the 3-point line, Duquesne still shot the fourth most three-pointers of all teams in the Atlantic 10. The following chart displays player per-game average statistics for {{the regular season and}} Atlantic 10 tournament.|$|E

5|$|The late Norman chapter house, {{situated}} {{south of}} the transept, contains {{some of the first}} uses of pointed arches in England. It also has a rich sculptural decoration, with a variety of Romanesque abstract motifs. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> aspects there are close similarities with the abbey gatehouse, supporting the view that the two structures were built around the same time in the 12thcentury, as put forward by Street in the 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|Tod favoured the then-fashionable {{concept of}} Romantic nationalism. Influenced by this, {{he thought that}} each princely state should be {{inhabited}} by only one community and his policies were designed to expel Marathas, Pindaris and other groups from Rajput territories. It also influenced his instigation of treaties that were intended to redraw the territorial boundaries of the various states. The geographical and political boundaries before his time had in some cases been blurred, primarily due to local arrangements based on common kinship, and he wanted a more evident delineation of the entities, He was successful <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> endeavours.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called inunnguaq.|$|E

5|$|Back in Uppsala, Linnaeus' {{relations}} with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted {{an invitation from}} the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg's family. Sohlberg's father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun. Sohlberg's father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic {{was one of the}} most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> accepted.|$|E
5|$|In 194950, {{none of the}} Harveys played {{together}} at first-class level; Merv had retired, Mick had moved to Queensland looking for more opportunities, while Neil was in South Africa with the Australian team. Ray and Mick played in one match each for the season, but not against the other. In 1950-51, Ray was selected in two matches for Victoria, both when Neil and the other Test players were competing against England. Both of these were against Tasmania, so he did not meet Mick. However, there were no international fixtures coinciding with Victoria’s two matches with Queensland, and Neil met Mick <b>in</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> matches. In 1951-52, Ray was able to gain selection more regularly for Victoria. All of these came when Neil and the other Test players were playing for Australia; when they available for Victoria, Ray was not selected. Ray played in both of Victoria's matches against Queensland, for whom Mick played in the first match.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> instances, {{a failed}} retreat by Hybrida and his cavalry {{led to his}} unit being {{absolutely}} defeated and any plunder accrued during the attack was forfeited back to the natives. This lack of success, rather than the extortion of the provincials, drew {{the attention of the}} Senate who threatened to recall and prosecute Hybrida for his mismanagement of the province. In 60 BC, Hybrida was quietly replaced by Gaius Octavius as the Governor of Macedonia and in March of 59 BC, during the consulship of Caesar and Marcus Culpurnius Bibulus, was prosecuted for the mishandling of the governorship by Caesar and Crassus. In the end, Hybrida was tried by Marcus Caelius Rufus for his participation in the Catilinarian conspiracy and by Lucius Caninius Gallus for his crimes in Macedonia. He was defended by Cicero, not out of duty but as a protest against the current state of affairs in Rome. Despite this, Hybrida was found guilty of his crimes, ordered to pay a fine and be banished from Rome to a place of his choosing. Hybrida had settled upon Cephallenia as his residence for the duration of his exile.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> {{works the}} candlelit setting had a realist justification. Viewing {{sculpture}} by candlelight, when the contours showed well and there {{might even be}} an impression of movement from the flickering light, was a fashionable practice described by Goethe. In the orrery demonstration the shadows cast by the lamp representing the sun were {{an essential part of}} the display, used to demonstrate eclipses. But there seems no reason other than heightened drama to stage the air pump experiment in a room lit by a single candle, and in two later paintings of the subject by Charles-Amédée-Philippe van Loo the lighting is normal.|$|E
5|$|The {{account of}} Southchurch's {{provisioning}} was first {{made available to}} a wider audience through {{the writings of the}} English historian Helen Cam. Cam was responsible for groundbreaking work on the Hundred Rolls, and their relevance to English local government, through her Studies in the Hundred Rolls (1921) and The Hundred and the Hundred Rolls (1930). <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> she made mention of what she calls '...the most picturesque series of extortions recorded in the Essex returns.' It was, however, in a paper published in the English Historical Review as early as 1916 that she gave the most detailed account of Southchurch's plot. Here she traced the dissemination of the Viking legend through Geoffrey of Monmouth, and speculated that Southchurch could have been acquainted with a later version by Gaimar, Wace or Layamon, or through a local, popular legend.|$|E
5|$|This {{approach}} {{demonstrates the}} effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models. Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously. That fails {{to account for the}} fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women. Stephen Knowels et al. use a neoclassical growth model to show that women's education has a positive statistically significant effect on labor productivity, more robust than that of men's education. <b>In</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> cases, economists highlight and address the gender biases of macroeconomic variables to show that gender plays a significant role in models' outcomes.|$|E
