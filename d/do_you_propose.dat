2500|$|In {{addition}} to the county commissioners and the City Council of Chester, the townships of Aston, Upper Darby, Springfield and Tinicum adopted resolutions condemning Green's plan in no uncertain terms. The Anti-Annexation Committee of Southeastern Pennsylvania, consisting of the Republican chairmen of the four suburban counties, as well as Lancaster and Lehigh counties, was formed. The committee held strategy meetings with Bell, Milliken, county state representatives, county commissioners and War Board members.

County chairman Connor posed a question to his GOP counterpart, Mayor Eyre: [...] "How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>propose</b> to give the voters of Delaware County equal representation without a jointure {{with one or more}} of the adjoining areas? I for one do not want Congressional redistricting to be handled in the same disproportionate manner that the Republican Party handled the redistricting of Delaware County for the State Legislature a short time ago." ...|$|E
