25|$|The hill’s name {{translates}} {{from the}} Scottish Gaelic language as “Hill of the Herding” and this {{refers to the}} fact that it lies on the route of one of the main north-south ancient drovers' roads of Scotland, the area around the mountain was used as a gathering point for the cattle. The western corrie of the hill could well have been the collecting point as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> gentle bowl which is ideal for summer grazing and the concealing of cattle. James Stobie’s map of 1770 refers to the hill as Ben Chualach, Charles Knight’s Penny Cyclopaedia of the 1840s also uses this name and the hill seems to have been designated as Beinn a’ Chuallaich by Victorian cartographers in the second half of the 19th century.|$|E

Ethel is now restricted to a wheelchair and it is left to Dot to cater for her every need, which often leaves her exhausted. Ethel appears to have lost none of her zest for life, despite her considerable age, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> shock to Dot when Ethel reveals that she is suffering from terminal cancer and is not going to live much longer.

25|$|In 1803, the Supreme Court {{established}} {{judicial review}} of federal legislation in Marbury v. Madison, holding, however, that Congress could not grant unconstitutional power to the Court itself. The Constitution does not explicitly state that the courts may exercise judicial review; however, the notion that courts could declare laws unconstitutional was envisioned by the founding fathers. Alexander Hamilton, for example, mentioned and expounded upon the doctrine in Federalist No. 78. Originalists on the Supreme Court have argued that if the constitution does not say something explicitly it is unconstitutional to infer what it should, might or could have said. Judicial review means that the Supreme Court can nullify a congressional law. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> check by the courts on the legislative authority and limits congressional power substantially. In 1857, for example, the Supreme Court struck down provisions of a congressional act of 1820 in its Dred Scott decision. At the same time, the Supreme Court can extend congressional power through its constitutional interpretations.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{is held in}} {{high regard}} for his Choralis Constantinus. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> {{anthology}} of over 450 chant-based polyphonic motets for the Proper of the Mass. It had its origins in a commission that Isaac received from the Cathedral in Konstanz, Germany in April 1508 to set many of the Propers unique to the local liturgy. Isaac was in Konstanz because Maximilian had called {{a meeting of the}} Reichstag (German Parliament of nobles) there and Isaac was on hand to provide music for the Imperial court chapel choir. After the deaths of both Maximilian and Isaac, Ludwig Senfl, who had been Isaac's pupil {{as a member of the}} Imperial court choir, gathered all the Isaac settings of the Proper and placed them into liturgical order for the church year. But the anthology was not published until 1555, after Senfl's death, by which time the reforms of the Council of Trent had made many of the texts obsolete. The motets remain some of the finest examples of chant-based Renaissance polyphony in existence.|$|E

25|$|Broadcast 15 February 1995, {{the final}} episode deals with plants {{that live in}} hostile environments. Attenborough visits Ellesmere Island, north of the Arctic Circle, to {{demonstrate}} that even {{in a place that}} is unconducive to life, it can be found. Algae and lichens grow in or on rock, and during summer, when the ice melts, flowers are much more apparent. However, they must remain close to the ground {{to stay out of the}} chilling wind. In the Tasmanian mountains, plants conserve heat by growing into 'cushions' that act as solar panels, with as many as a million individual shoots grouped together as one. Others, such as the lobelia in Mount Kenya, have a 'fur coat' of dense hairs on their leaves. The saguaro cactus in the Sonoran Desert flourishes because of its ability to retain vast amounts of water, which can't be lost through leaves because it has none. Many desert dwellers benefit from an accelerated life cycle, blooming rapidly within weeks after rainfall. Conversely, Mount Roraima is one of the wettest places on Earth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> sandstone plateau with high waterfalls and nutrients are continuously washed away, so plants have to adapt their diet if they are to survive. A bladderwort is shown invading a bromeliad. Inhabitants of lakes have other problems to contend with: those that dominate the surface will proliferate, and the Amazon water lily provides an apt illustration. Attenborough ends the series with an entreaty for the conservation of plant species.|$|E
500|$|CBS senior {{journalist}} Danna Walker stated, [...] "There is {{criticism that}} it is only a story because she is a pretty blonde—and white—and it is criticism that journalists are taking to heart and looking elsewhere for other stories. But it is a big story because it is an American girl who went off on an adventure and didn't come back. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> mystery, it is something people can identify with." [...] Good Morning America anchor Chris Cuomo was unapologetic of his program's extensive coverage of the Holloway case. [...] "I don't believe it's my role to judge what people want to watch… If they say, 'I {{want to know what happened}} to this girl'… I want to help them find out." ...|$|E

500|$|The FIA {{planned to}} [...] "put {{almost all of}} it into a {{charitable}} foundation which will then have the resources to undertake important work on improving safety in motor sport and in road safety", and thus the FIA Foundation was created in 2001. In addition, the FIA continued to receive an annual dividend from the deal, Mosley stated: [...] "Over the totality of the contract, and on an annual basis, the sum we have accepted represents billions of dollars. Looked at from that point of view, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> amount of money." [...] Lovell compares the figure to extend the rights to 100 years to the £600million KirchGruppe paid for the rights to the 2002 Football World Cup and the £1.1billion British Sky Broadcasting paid for a three-year package of English Premier League football. The figure was not entirely comparable however due to the dispute over who actually owned Formula One. Before the settlement with the EU Commission was reached, Mosley feared that the FIA was losing control over the sport following a heated argument with Ecclestone in Paris. Ecclestone argued that he had built Formula One into the entity that it was and the FIA only had rights to designate the event as official. Ecclestone threatened to [...] "do a scorched earth" [...] if another party were to gain control of the commercial side of Formula One. Mosley came up with the solution in order for the FIA to retain its sporting management role and Ecclestone to retain his commercial role.|$|E

Fred regarded Headingley as his headquarters and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> pleasure to be receiving this on his behalf in front of the Headingley crowd".|$|E

We even had time to take our field glasses and saw quite distinctly an oval form with shiny surface, one side of which was brilliant from the sun." [...] Another description by Roerich was of a [...] "shiny body flying from north to south. Field glasses are at hand. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>huge</b> body. One side glows in the sun. It is oval in shape. Then it somehow turns in another direction and disappears in the southwest." ...|$|E

[...] Fenwick revealed there were [...] "strict rules about haircuts and all that because of continuity", saying that because of the warm weather when they filmed the pre-recorded section, he and Harold were [...] "quite brown", so said they might have to use fake tan. The live scenes used 19 cameras, along with the 31 regular cast members, plus 11 child cast members and at least 450 extras. As the programme switched from pre-recorded to live scenes, Fenwick, in character, winked at the camera and said [...] "Here we go!" [...] Part of the relay was shown on BBC News.|$|E
