5|$|A {{town that}} had just over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population of}} nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 <b>high-tech</b> <b>industry,</b> which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, the Bay Area {{and the rest}} of Northern California became the center of the {{counterculture}} movement. Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley and the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood in San Francisco were seen as centers of activity, with the hit American pop song San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair) further enticing like-minded individuals to join the movement in the Bay Area and leading to the Summer of Love. In the proceeding decades, the Bay Area would cement itself as a hotbed of New Left activism, student activism, opposition to the Vietnam War and other anti-war movements, the black power movement, and the gay rights movement. At the same time, San Jose {{and the rest of}} the South Bay began to rapidly develop as it began to transition from a largely agricultural-based economy into the hotbed of the <b>high-tech</b> <b>industry.</b> Fred Terman, the director of a top-secret research project at Harvard University during World War II, joined the faculty at Stanford University in order to reshape the university's engineering department. His students, including David Packard and William Hewlett would later help usher in the region's high-tech revolution. In 1955, Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory opened for business near Stanford, and although the business venture was a financial failure, it was the first semiconductor company in the Bay Area, and the talent that it attracted to the region eventually led to a high-tech cluster of companies later known as Silicon Valley.|$|E

40|$|The {{international}} business literature posits {{that the major}} motive for international strategic alliances is to share resources, costs, and risks in foreign operations. Based on the data collected in 233 alliances in low-tech industries and 192 alliances in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries,</b> this study finds that the argument is tenable in low-tech industries but untenable in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries.</b> In <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries,</b> international strategic alliances are mainly used to mitigate environmental dynamism. The identification of different functions of international strategic alliances in low-tech and <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> has important managerial implications. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|This paper empirically explores {{a highly}} relevant, {{although}} poorly investigated topic: internationalization of family firms that operate in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries.</b> Specifically, we compare internationalization {{of family and}} nonfamily entrepreneurial ventures in these industries. Relying on prior studies on internationalization of family firms, we speculate on how the specificities of <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> shape {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of family entrepreneurial ventures in pursuing internationalization as compared with their nonfamily peers. In the empirical part of the paper, through a rigorous quantitative analysis of unique data from 264 Italian high-tech entrepreneurial ventures, we explore whether in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> family entrepreneurial ventures are more (or less) likely to pursue internationalization than their nonfamily counterparts. Surprisingly enough, our econometric estimates indicate that, in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries,</b> family entrepreneurial ventures exhibit a higher internationalization propensity than their nonfamily peer...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in economic integration show rather diverse patterns of {{integration in the}} world economy. Some countries remain predominantly in the low-tech industries whereas other countries succeed in becoming competitive in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> as well. The authors postulate that a country positioning itself {{at the lower end}} of the spectrum of <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> is more favorable to its long-term development than aiming at the upper end of low-tech industries. They argue that countries which specialize in the lower end of the medium–high-tech activities are rewarded by faster productivity increases also in the upper end of the <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries.</b> In contrast, early specialization in medium–low-tech branches yields positive spillovers, mainly in the low-tech sector, which is not conducive to increasing activity in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries.</b> The authors sketch a theoretical outline of this idea and present econometric results, including four aggregate manufac-turing branches across 37 countries. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper tests a new {{approach}} by linking merchandise trade to general business registers (sectoral high-tech trade). It highlights that the data shown using the "traditional" approach to calculate the trade value of the <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> via correspondence tables represents relatively well the exports to third countries (Extratrade) but not so well the exports to other EU Member States (Intratrade). The analysis also showed that the "traditional" approach gives a better estimation of the values exported by <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> than of the values imported by them. Therefore, calculating the trade value of <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> via correspondence tables can lead to an overestimation of their trade, especially {{with respect to their}} imports. In addition, the paper shows the methodological issues encounter when linking (high-tech) foreign trade data with business registers, it presents some first analytical results of the "high-tech trade by enterprise characteristics" especially with respect to the share of high-tech goods traded by the <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries,</b> and it gives an outlook for further research.

Since the 1980 s, China has served as an example of one of these developing countries. In attempting to create and develop <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> in China, the Chinese government has long promoted university-industry collaboration. As a result, the Chinese government has been widely considered as the catalyst behind the development of university-industry collaboration.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} whether government procurement can work as a de facto innovation policy tool. We develop an endogenous growth model with quality-improving innovation that incorporates industries with heterogeneous innovation sizes. Government demand in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> increases the market size in these industries and, with it, the incentives for private firms to invest in R&D. At the economy-wide level, the additional R&D induced in <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> outweighs the R&D foregone in all remaining industries. The implications of the model are empirically tested using a unique data set that includes federal procurement in U. S. states. We find evidence that a shift in the composition of government purchases toward <b>high-tech</b> <b>industries</b> indeed stimulates privately funded company R&D. public demand, technological change, endogenous growth...|$|R
