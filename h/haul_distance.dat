40|$|ABSTRACT. A spreadsheet‐based manure {{transport}} and land application decision tool, MANURE$HAUL, {{was developed to}} provide farmers, custom applicators, and others involved with manure management a manure cost and labor calculator for liquid manure systems using top‐loading tank spreaders and nurse tanks. The manure hauling capacity was {{a function of the}} machinery set selected, manure tank capacity, and <b>hauling</b> <b>distance.</b> Manure {{transport and}} application costs were a function of spreader tank capacity and <b>hauling</b> <b>distance.</b> Representative 175 ‐, 350 ‐, 700 ‐, and 1, 400 ‐cow dairy farms were compared to evaluate hauling time and machinery costs for a range of machinery sets, <b>hauling</b> <b>distances,</b> and nutrient values for the manure applied. Equipment ownership and operating costs were calculated for agitation, pumping, manure transport, land application, and incorporation. Equipment ownership and operating costs ranged from 0. 32 ¢/L of manure hauled per year (1. 18 ¢/gal) for a 175 ‐cow dairy using a 11400 ‐L (3000 ‐gal) spreader with an average <b>hauling</b> <b>distance</b> of 1. 6 km (1 mile) and broadcast application with tillage incorporation to 0. 50 ¢/L (1. 91 ¢/gal) for a 1400 ‐cow farm with slurry injection and an average <b>hauling</b> <b>distance</b> of 6. 4 km (4 mile) with two 34100 ‐L (9000 ‐gal) spreaders and four nurse trucks for over‐the‐road transport. Two nurse trucks supplying a tractor‐drawn spreader became more cost‐effective than two tractor‐drawn spreaders alone at a <b>hauling</b> <b>distance</b> of about 4. 8 km (3 mile). Injection application increased the number of days needed for manure application compared to a broadcast application with tillage incorporation, but when the time for tillage incorporation was included the total time needed for field operations with injection was less than broadcast with incorporation.

40|$|Currently, {{construction}} professionals {{can easily}} determine {{the amount of}} cut and fill on a mass excavation project, but can only make an educated and intuitive guess as to the required minimum <b>haul</b> <b>distances</b> and the directions to move the earth. This paper develops a mathematical optimization model for the determination of these minimum <b>haul</b> <b>distances</b> and directions. The two-dimensional model presented uses linear programming.

With this mathematical model, the quantity of earth hauled, the minimum <b>haul</b> <b>distances,</b> and the locations to haul the material are determined. The solution is then made into a vector diagram detailing the quantity and direction to move material that can be used by nontechnical personnel in the field.

40|$|Land {{levelling}} is {{an important}} process of the agriculutral land consolidation projects. The land levelling process starts by determining the appropriate levels of the terrain and solves the earthwork allocation for the predetermined terrain levels. The recent attempt, reported in the literature, to find an optimal process is a GIS-based approach which solves the transportation problem by determing the designed terrain level and optimal <b>hauling</b> <b>distances</b> that result in the lowest hauling cost. In this study, the Vogel approximation method (VAM) was adopted in initializing {{the solution to the}} transportation problems, and the optimizaion of the solutions obtained by the VAM was examined using the modified distribution method (MODI). To verify the reliability of this combined method, a case study was carried out based on the proposed land livelling project at the Lixian District of Beijing, China. The results show that the optimal average <b>hauling</b> <b>distance</b> calculated from the proposed linear programming model is 79. 53 m shorter than that estimated using the empirical method, and the unit cost calculated from the linear programming model is 33. 4 % lower than the experienced cost.

The purpose of scheduling backfill {{is to do}} volume balance between out-pit and in-pit dumping and control amount low grade that goes to stockpile and calculate distances hauled during mining process. The material scheduled divided into overburden, low grade, and ore. The material could be sent to following destinations, overburden to in-pit and out-pit dumps, low grade to in-pit, out-put dumps, stockpiles, and ore to stockpiles only. In controlling dumping sequence, there are three consideration constraints: geotechnical, capacity, and <b>haul</b> <b>distance.</b> Geotechnical constraints use dump slope which ensures maximum dump overall slope angle not exceed 13 - 15 degree, also offset dump to face, assist specified distance (50 m) between toe of working face and “toe” of dumps.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{influence}} of different haul distances of a codend beach seine on the catchability of fish in a surf zone. Two different surf zone sites (A and B) at the Cassino Beach (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) were sampled at three different distances, parallel to the beach (30, 60, and 90 m). Starting 40 m from the beach line, diagonal distances of approximately 50, 70, and 100 m were swept. The total CPUE and CPUA haul distances are compatible with a declining trend in catch rates with increased <b>haul</b> <b>distance</b> at both sites. However, statistically significant differences were observed only for the short distance CPUA (50 m) in relation to the other haul distances at one of the sites sampled. Two fish size groups were observed (TL 40 mm), but only small individuals (< 40 mm) captured in the shorter <b>haul</b> <b>distance</b> at site B showed significant differences in CPUA. This result indicates that size structure for hauls at different distances was equal and that smaller individuals determined the pattern of fish abundance.
