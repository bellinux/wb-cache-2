Rather than a conventional contact friction braking, this system are more efficient, quick in the response and has no wear so it has good durability. So three different papers are reviewed and summarized here to know the principles, applicability and future scope of <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>braking</b> system. Key words: <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>braking,</b> Permanent magnet; Magnetic braking, FEM of electromagnetic braking...|$|R

50|$|Most drum motors can {{be fitted}} with back stop {{non-reversing}} bearings to prevent belts in inclined conveyors from rolling back or with <b>electro-magnetic</b> <b>brakes</b> for reversible inclined conveyors or for quick stopping.

50|$|The {{report found}} that the 7:40 railmotor train had a few {{shortcomings}} related to its equipment. The train could be stopped faster if it were running engine first because the driver could use the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the engine instead of the somewhat less effective <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the autocoach. Also, {{the way that the}} mechanical linkages were arranged that connected the regulator control from the driving trailer was somewhat unreliable in that there was play in the system that prevented the regulator from being opened fully. There was also an issue where a connecting pin in the regulator linkage was prone to falling out.|$|R

5000|$|The cars take {{electricity}} from a 550 Volts DC overhead line. Each car is 13.37 m long, 2.5 m wide and 3.45 m high, with 50 seats {{and a total}} carrying capacity of 120 passengers. They have four [...] motors, giving a maximum speed of 35 km/h, and are equipped for rheostatic braking, in addition to air <b>brakes,</b> <b>electro-magnetic</b> track <b>brakes</b> and hand brakes.|$|R
5000|$|A {{steam brake}} acts {{directly}} and immediately; the sudden {{opening of the}} <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> {{can result in a}} slight overbraking by locking the wheels. The operation of a steam brake therefore requires a great deal of experience from the engine driver.|$|R
5000|$|On a long {{train the}} brake force during a brake {{application}} was not consistent {{along the length}} of the train; the response to the driver’s operation of the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> varied according to train length and the variation caused longitudinal surging.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} driver (US: engineer) worked {{on one side}} of the locomotive, and the fireman on the other; the fireboxes separated them. The regulators for both power bogies were located above the centre of the fireboxes, with the steam <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> at one end.|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a solenoid-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp battery was disconnected and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the <b>brake</b> <b>valve</b> solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|R
50|$|The Westinghouse {{system uses}} air {{reservoirs}} on each vehicle and compressed air is released from these reservoirs to the brake cylinders as {{the pressure in}} the train pipe is reduced by the driver operating the <b>brake</b> <b>valve.</b> This process causes a mechanical linkage to press the brake blocks against the wheels.|$|R
50|$|In EP operation, a distributor, {{performing}} functions {{similar to}} those of the triple valve, is operated directly and instantly by electrical control from the driver’s <b>brake</b> <b>valve.</b> The Westinghouse <b>brake</b> cylinders and air reservoirs and pumps are used, so that only the means of transmitting the driver’s command is changed.|$|R

Smaller measures included diagnosis and subsequent repair of the driver's <b>brake</b> <b>valve,</b> the installation of new relays into some safety circuits and some software changes.|$|R
