However, Vyse is separated from Aika and Fina when Drachma's ship is severely damaged in a Valuan attack. Vyse ends up stranded on the small Crescent Island, where he manages to uncover letters and a map left behind by another pirate seeking a great treasure. Vyse is later found by a fellow Blue Rogue named Gilder, who takes him aboard to help him search for his friends. Meanwhile, Aika and Fina {{end up in the}} care of another Blue Rogue, Clara, who takes them to Nasr to help search for Vyse. Aika and Fina find out about the same treasure Vyse read up on, and the three soon reunite, but are then captured by Ramirez and brought to the Valuans' prison fortress. By enlisting the aid of the Valuan prince Enrique, who has lost patience with his government's tyranny, and stealing a powerful Valuan warship named the Delphinus, the Blue Rogues are able to escape. Vyse brings everyone back to Crescent Island, upon which he formally establishes a base of operations and living quarters for he and his fellow shipmates.|$|E

50|$|Selina Trieff (born in Brooklyn, 1934 - 14 January 2015) was an American {{artist who}} painted and {{exhibited}} for over fifty years. Trieff painted archetypal figures in a flattened and heavily delineated manner, which acted at once as self-portraits and allegories {{for the human}} condition. She developed her singular style of figuration through her strong abstract roots which continued to evolve throughout her life. Although she most often painted figures and animals, Trieff considered herself an abstract artist. Among her animal paintings are <b>Green</b> Goat with <b>Moon</b> (1983), Two Figures with Goat (1997), Three Figures with Green Goat (1992) and Connected (1996).|$|R
