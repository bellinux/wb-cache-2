In the 1950s and 1960s, however, the roles were {{pervasive}} and not limited to North America: from 1940 to 1970, butch/femme bar culture flourished in Britain, though there were fewer class distinctions. They further identified {{members of a group}} that had been marginalized; women who had been rejected by most of society had an <b>inside</b> <b>view</b> of an exclusive group of people that took a high amount of knowledge to function in. Butch and femme were considered coarse by American lesbians of higher social standing during this period. Many wealthier women married to satisfy their familial obligations, and others escaped to Europe to live as expatriates.|$|E

A subsequent article in BusinessWeek highlighted the book among [...] "The Best Business Books of 1997". In a review in The Washington Post, Judy Mann called the book [...] "a scathing -- and frightening -- indictment of the FAA, the multibillion-dollar airline industry and its lapdogs in Congress". James T. Yenckel of The Washington Post called the book [...] "frightening" [...] and [...] "informative", and wrote that [...] "passengers should {{have this kind of}} safety information when choosing a flight." [...] In a review for The Virginian-Pilot, Michael Anft wrote: [...] "She may be to the airplane what Ralph Nader was to the automobile."

[...] R.J.

500|$|Alex Chan, 27 {{years old}} at the time of the civil unrest, was a French-born {{freelance}} industrial designer whose parents were Chinese immigrants from Hong Kong. Although Chan was successful professionally, he felt that there was racial and cultural discrimination in France, based on his own previous attempts to find housing and violence directed towards him. He lived in Seine-Saint-Denis, a suburb of Paris, near housing projects where rioting had caused the destruction of cars owned by acquaintances. In the aftermath of the unrest, Chan was dissatisfied, stating that [...] "the media, especially in the United States, ... linked what was happening, the riots, to terrorism and put the blame on the Muslim community". Chan wanted instead to depict [...] "more human" [...] rioters who turned to violence in response to racism. According to Chan, the title The French Democracy is meant to be ironic, in that the youths express themselves by rioting rather than through the political system. He elaborated: a shortcut made with The Movies technology about the recent events concerning riots in French suburbs. This movie is trying to help people have a better understanding of the origin of these events, as some reasons that pushed all this youth to have such violent acts. As a matter of fact TFD offers a sincere <b>inside</b> <b>view</b> from a French citizen who lives in one of these neighborhoods where the riots took place. This fictional documentary is strongly inspired by real events and reactions and tries to make the spectator think more about how French society could and should potentially be.|$|E

2500|$|Although Michel {{was under}} {{pressure}} from veterans' organizations to create a film document that would honor French Resistance fighters, Wormser argued for a scholarly approach that would show the concentration camps as a systematic microcosm of the German war economy. Michel recognized that this approach would enable broader financing, and both re-envisioned the film as [...] "communicating historical research through contemporary media." [...] Initially, Michel thought the film could {{take the form of}} a montage of news reports. But as a result of the exhibit Resistance, Liberation, Deportation, both he and Wormser had received many items created by former inmates during their internment, making Michel and Wormster believe that a unique perspective would be created by providing an <b>inside</b> <b>view</b> of the camps. [...] "The genocide of the Jews was treated in French remembrance as more of a side issue—something that was in any case supposedly a matter for the Jews themselves and not for the majority of society. Michel and Wormser might have wanted scholarly objectivity instead of the heroism favoured by the deportees' association...but nevertheless the Holocaust had remained a blind spot even for them." ...|$|E

If she liked Verena very nearly as much as she tried to convince Miss Chancellor, she was conscious of disliking Miss Chancellor more than she should probably ever be able to reveal to Verena.

The passage quoted from Stephen Eddy's Life of Bishop Wilfrid, at p. 86 of Churton's [...] "Early English Church," [...] gives us one of the transformations or petrifactions of the wooden Saxon churches. [...] "At Ripon he built a new church of polished stone, with columns variously ornamented, and porches."
