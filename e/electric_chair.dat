During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973). As Governor, he oversaw four executions: one by <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> and three by lethal injection. Later, as president, Clinton was the first president to pardon a death-row inmate since the federal death penalty was reinstated in 1988.|$|E

Unaware that the power is active, Mayor Quimby straps himself into the <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> in a publicity attempt. Ralph then tells Bart that Lisa can probably {{figure out a way to}} warn the Mayor. She decides to launch a model rocket with a warning message attached and aims it toward the penitentiary. However, the rocket is blown off-course and crashes through Mr. Burns' office window. Mr. Burns reads the note and disables the penitentiary's power. In the aftermath, the Simpsons congratulate Ralph, for pointing out that Lisa could solve the problem.|$|E

The black Madonna slices across the white Madonna's stomach, which is mirrored in the imprisoned Madonna's stomach in the chamber. She rides on a hanging chain from the ceiling and smashes a mirror across the wall. The black Madonna breaks open a dark room by throwing the white Madonna against the wall.

Meanwhile, the Madonna in the torture chamber wears phylacteries around her arm while hiding behind an <b>electric</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a judge, Parker was {{notable for}} {{independently}} researching each {{case that he}} heard. He was {{generally considered to be}} pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. In the 1902 decision Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co, Parker found against a woman whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission, ruling that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year. In the same year, Parker upheld the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by <b>electric</b> <b>chair.</b>|$|E
5|$|As the {{breakdown}} happens, the soldiers bind {{her on the}} chair but she laughs, kicks and spits on them.

The black Madonna falls down and concurrently a soldier pulls the switch on the <b>electric</b> <b>chair.</b> They laugh loudly thinking Madonna to be burnt but as the smoke clears, they see that no remnants are to be found. They rush to inspect the chair closely and notice three letters (לאו) being burnt in the chair. They scratch their head and see {{a vision of a}} bearded man laughing at them. Madonna is shown running from the torture chamber and opens the door, as the video ends with the gun barrel sequence.|$|E

5|$|Lethal {{injection}} {{was proposed}} and adopted {{on the grounds}} it was more humane than the methods of execution {{in place at the}} time, such as the <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> and gas chamber. Opponents of lethal injection reject this argument, noting multiple cases where executions have been either painful, prolonged, or both. According to the Death Penalty Information Center, lethal injections have the highest rate of botched executions of any method used in the US, with 7.12% of executions using this method between 1982 and 2010 considered to have not gone according to plan. A study published in The Lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. However, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled 7–2 in 2008 (Baze v. Rees) and 5–4 in 2015 (Glossip v. Gross) that lethal injection does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment.|$|E
5|$|The dream girl {{is found}} in the form of Nancy, who {{responds}} minimally to Vic but is enamored of Renaldo. Victor and several residents of the building, including Mrs. Trend, run afoul of the killers, and a seemingly random series of slapstick murders occur, for all of which Victor is ultimately blamed. Nancy inevitably becomes target and Vic saves her and kills the exterminators after a long comical fight sequence. The flashback ends and Victor is in the <b>electric</b> <b>chair,</b> and awaits his execution while an elaborate race sequence occurs in which Nancy, accompanied by several nuns, drive manically, Nancy at the wheel, to the scene in order to prove his innocence. Before the switch is pulled however, Nancy arrives just in time and clears his name. The movie concludes with their marriage.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{he needs}} allies, Batman works with Gordon {{and the police}} to retake the prison. Sitting at the <b>electric</b> <b>chair,</b> the Joker offers Batman a choice: kill Bane, or allow Bane's {{heartbeat}} to charge the chair and kill the Joker. Batman uses the electric gloves to stop Bane's heart. Satisfied, the Joker leaves, intending to detonate bombs placed around the city. Batman revives Bane, who injects himself with a steroid that transforms him into a hulking beast. He loses the ensuing battle to Batman and suffers amnesia as a side effect from the steroid, thus preserving Batman's secret identity. With Gordon's help, Batman locates the Joker in the prison chapel. Dismayed that Bane is still alive, the Joker tries to goad Batman into killing him but Batman subdues him instead. Gordon chooses not to pursue Batman, believing he can help the city. In a radio interview during the credits, Quincy Sharp says he will lobby to reopen Arkham Asylum to house the city's worst criminals; after the credits, an imprisoned Deathstroke is approached by Amanda Waller to join her Suicide Squad.|$|E

5|$|Ride the Lightning is {{the second}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory {{to the rest of}} the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{considered}} replacing {{hanging with}} the <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> (as well as considering {{the gas chamber}} and lethal injection) during the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment, the findings of which were published in 1953. The Commission concluded that the <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> had no particular advantages over hanging, and so, the <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> was not adopted {{for use in the}} United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> {{was adopted}} by Ohio (1897), Massachusetts (1900), New Jersey (1906) and Virginia (1908), and soon became the {{prevalent}} method of execution in the United States, replacing hanging. Most of the states that currently use or have used the <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> lie east of the Mississippi River. The <b>electric</b> <b>chair</b> remained the most prominent execution method until the mid-1980s when lethal injection became widely accepted for conducting judicial executions.|$|E

50|$|Wayne County and the <b>Electric</b> <b>Chairs</b> were {{supported}} by The Police during their 1977 tour of Holland. Dust, a Czechoslovakian, was deported during the band's return to the United Kingdom following a tour, when the authorities discovered that his visa had expired over a year ago. He was replaced by J. J. Johnson, and the band recorded their first album, The <b>Electric</b> <b>Chairs.</b> In order to recreate {{the sound of the}} album live, the band needed another guitarist, and so recruited Henry Padovani, of former tourmates the Police, on rhythm guitar.|$|R
5000|$|Being {{cast out}} of the Police did not slow Padovani's musical career, however. After taking a two-month {{vacation}} in Corsica, he returned to London and was immediately handed the rhythm guitar spot with Wayne County & the <b>Electric</b> <b>Chairs,</b> {{who at the time}} were far better known than the Police. [...] The Police were actually their support act in 1977. [...] The band's first album with Padovani, Storm the Gates of Heaven, was also his debut as a songwriter. Besides a pair of group compositions, he wrote the music for the song [...] "Cry of Angels". After one more album, Things Your Mother Never Told You, Wayne County & the <b>Electric</b> <b>Chairs</b> split in two. Padovani remained with bassist Val Haller and drummer J.J. Johnson, and the trio recorded a final single, [...] "So Many Ways", as simply The <b>Electric</b> <b>Chairs,</b> before management problems forced them to disband completely. During this period, Padovani and Haller took turns on lead vocals.|$|R
