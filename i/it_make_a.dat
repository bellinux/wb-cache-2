2500|$|Norovirus {{infection}} {{is characterized by}} nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. [...] A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. [...] General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fevers may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous and most who contract <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> full recovery within two to three days. On surfaces, norovirus is rapidly inactivated by either sufficient heating or by chlorine-based disinfectants and polyquaternary amines, but the virus is less susceptible to alcohols and detergents.|$|E

The song was written by Mercury and Marcelo Quintanilha. Also in 2010, the year that the Electric Trio celebrates 60 years and Axé Music 25 years, the singer reaches 20 years of solo career - with significant-selling records.

2500|$|A {{distinct}} use of {{the term}} sound from its use in physics is that in physiology and psychology, where the term refers to the subject of perception by the brain. The field of psychoacoustics is dedicated to such studies. Historically the word [...] "sound" [...] referred exclusively to an effect in the mind. Webster's 1947 dictionary defined sound as: [...] "that which is heard; the effect which is produced by the vibration of a body affecting the ear." [...] This meant (at least in 1947) the correct response to the question: [...] "if a tree falls in the forest with no one to hear it fall, does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> sound?" [...] was [...] "no". However, owing to contemporary usage, definitions of sound as a physical effect are prevalent in most dictionaries. Consequently, the answer to the same question (see above) is now [...] "yes, a tree falling in the forest with no one to hear it fall does make a sound".|$|E

Education in the past set out to make a Christian and a citizen and afterwards a gentleman out of the crude, vulgar, self-seeking individual. Does education even pretend to do as much to-day? It does nothing of the sort. Our young people are taught to read and write. They are taught bookkeeping and languages that are likely to be useful to them. They are given a certain measure of technical education, and they are taught to shove. And then we turn them out into the world to get on.

60|$|Among other ingenious surmises, the {{question}} was then raised, whether Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to that which he had fired, {{it turned out to}} have no more destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to the utmost.
