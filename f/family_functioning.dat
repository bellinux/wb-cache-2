25|$|SSRIs, {{including}} sertraline, {{reduce the}} symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. Side effects such as nausea are common. Sertraline is effective in alleviating {{the symptoms of}} premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a severe form of premenstrual syndrome. Significant improvement was observed in 50–60% of cases treated with sertraline vs. 20–30% of cases on placebo. The improvement began {{during the first week}} of treatment, and in addition to mood, irritability, and anxiety, improvement was reflected in better <b>family</b> <b>functioning,</b> social activity and general quality of life. Work functioning and physical symptoms, such as swelling, bloating and breast tenderness, were less responsive to sertraline. Taking sertraline only during the luteal phase, that is, the 12–14days before menses, was shown to work as well as continuous treatment.|$|E

Writer Jacquetta May, who once played Rachel Kominski in the programme, has commented that [...] " [...] represented the matriarchal relationship of strong woman/weak man...
