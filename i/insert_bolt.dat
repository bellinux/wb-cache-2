40|$|Nickel based {{superalloy}} Nimonic 80 A {{is commonly}} used as high temperature bolting material in industrial power-generating units, due to its high creep rupture strength and adequate creep rupture ductility. In this research the failure of Nimonic 80 A <b>insert</b> <b>bolts,</b> which connect the air duct rings to the combustion chamber ceiling, in a 159 MW unit is investigated. The bolts operating at about 650 ºC, failed prematurely after a service life of 36000 h. A broken fragment of the bolts dropped into the combustion chamber and entered the turbine section from a small design opening, severely damaging several of the turbine blades. Several <b>insert</b> <b>bolts</b> were retrieved from the accident site and used in this study. The investigation mainly included visual examinations, nondestructive testing, hardness testing, optical emission spectroscopy, metallography, and SEM fractography. The fracture location of the bolts was {{at the root of}} the first or second thread. Fractographic examinations identified intergranular creep rupture by wedge-shaped cracking as the operating failure mechanism. The macroscopically brittle fracture behavior of the <b>insert</b> <b>bolts</b> is discussed based on the formation of semi-continuous grain boundary carbide networks which resist grain boundary sliding, leading to stress build up and eventual loss of creep rupture ductility...|$|R

40|$|Following STS- 107, the External Tank (ET) Project {{implemented}} {{corrective actions}} and configuration {{changes at the}} ET bipod fitting. Among the corrective actions, the existing bolt lock wire which provided resistance to potential bolt rotation was removed. The lock wire removal was because of concerns with creating voids during foam application and potential for lock wire to become debris. The bolts had been previously lubricated to facilitate assembly but, because of elimination of the lock wire, the ET Project wanted to enable the locking feature of the insert. Thus, the lubrication was removed from bolt threads and instead applied to the washer under the bolt head. Lubrication is necessary to maximize joint pre-load while remaining within the bolt torque specification. The locking feature is implemented by thread crimping in at four places in the <b>insert.</b> As the <b>bolt</b> is torqued into the <b>insert</b> the <b>bolt</b> threads its way past the crimped parts of the insert. This provides the locking of the bolt, as torque is required to loosen the joint after clamping...|$|R

40|$|Sensors play an {{important}} role in providing feedback to robotic control systems. Vision can be an effective sensing modality due to its speed, low cost, and flexibility. It can also serve as an external sensor that can provide control information for devices that lack internal sensing. Many robot grippers do not have internal sensors. These grippers can be prone to error as they operate under open loop control and usually require a precise model of the environment to be effective.

In order to use strain gauges, which are <b>inserted</b> into the <b>bolt</b> shank, bolts need to be calibrated before we even use them in experimental research.

40|$|The {{distribution}} and transmission networks are two vital components of a reliable power system. When considering these networks, many countries use wood for fabricating service poles for the overhead power lines. A main disadvantage of using wooden poles is the formation of pole top fires, which initiates catastrophic events such as bushfires. This paper studies the leakage current distribution of a wooden pole which contains an <b>inserted</b> king <b>bolt</b> used to support the cross arm. A three dimensional resistance model is built up based on the electrical ladder network, and the leakage current is simulated for different scenarios that could occur in practice. The analysis show that {{a large part of}} the leakage current passes through the heartwood to the ground, except in the area of the metal bolt. This current increases at high moisture contents making the pole vulnerable to fire. The location of the bolt affects the leakage current as well, and the current reduces when the location of the bolt is varied along the length of the pole from top to bottom. The results also show that this model is superior to a two dimensional model, with a clear deviation in the actual current flow patterns...|$|R

An approach utilizing bonded in inserts with helicoils inside of them was implemented. During initial assembly, cracking sounds were heard followed by the lifting {{of one of the}} blind inserts out of its hole when the screws were torqued. A failure investigation was initiated to understand the mechanism of the failure. Ultimately, it was determined that the pre-tension caused by torqueing the fasteners is a much larger force than induced from the pressure loads of the suit which was not considered in the <b>insert</b> design. <b>Bolt</b> tension is determined by dividing the torque on the screw by a k value multiplied by the thread diameter of the bolt. The k value is a factor that accounts for friction in the system. A common value used for k for a non-lubricated screw is 0. 2.

The {{blasting method}} {{is regarded as}} a simple, convenient and economical method for constructing the underground structure, so it is advisable method for many underground structures to construct. But the investigation of the effect of the blasting dynamic load on the vicinal tunnel structure is rare, and the effect of blasting on the vicinal structures cannot be ignored either; sometimes, the effect will cause crack and even collapse in the tunnel liner and surrounding rock. So this paper presented the effect of blasting on the vicinal underground structure in differential cases using the finite element software Midas GTS. The investigation in this paper indicated which case will suffer the more severe effect caused by blast and let us know the vibration principle of the underground structure in differential case, and that will provide the knowledge about the vibration caused by blasting to the design and construction by numerical simulation; additionally, this paper has presented the reinforcement method about <b>inserting</b> the <b>bolt</b> into the surrounding rock to analyze how to resist the effect of the blast load. So from this analysis, it can be noted that the blasting method or the explosive energy will be chosen on the basis of different construction shape, and the reasonable location of the bolt will be adopted {{in order to reduce the}} effect of the dynamic on the vicinal tunnel structure...|$|R
