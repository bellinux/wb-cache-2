Archbishop Brandão's sudden death on 6 July 1678 further complicated matters, and the Cathedral chapter administering the Archdiocese of Goa following the vacancy created by his death, forbade the Canara Catholics from receiving the sacraments from the bishop or from priests appointed by him. In his turn, Bishop de Castro excommunicated those Catholics who were obedient to the Padroado authorities in Goa and their priests. In 1681, the Holy See appointed another Goan priest Fr. Joseph Vaz, as the Vicar <b>Forane</b> of Canara; {{he was asked}} not to submit to Bishop de Castro unless he showed the letter of appointment. However, after being convinced of its legitimacy, Fr. Vaz submitted to Bishop de Castro and brought about a truce. He further managed to persuade the bishop to delegate his jurisdiction to him while retaining the post.

The remaining phylotypes encountered in all samples proved to be human- or soil-associated bacteria and were presumed to be drilling fluid contaminants of rare occurrence.

40|$|La historiografia clàssica va {{considerar}} que, cap a mitjan segle XV, influències <b>foranes,</b> vehiculades principalment per Jaume Huguet i Bartolomé Bermejo, van capgirar el curs de la pintura aragonesa, que llavors vivia els darrers moments del gòtic internacional i començava a assumir alguns elements del nou realisme flamenc. Aquesta divisió de l’escola pictòrica aragonesa de la segona meitat del segle XV en dos grans corrents, un dels quals estretament vinculat al context català, ha estat avaluada i matisada per diversos historiadors al llarg dels darrers anys, i en aquesta línia s’inscriu també aquesta tesi. A la primera part es revisa la importància del darrer gòtic internacional aragonès en la formació dels pintors de la segona meitat del segle XV i la seva capacitat per assumir algunes propostes del nou realisme flamenc, principalment a través de la figura del Mestre de Riglos i la seva connexió amb un dels mestres etiquetats tradicionalment com a deixebles d’Huguet, Pere Garcia de Benavarri. D’altra banda, propostes recents recuperen per al catàleg d’un artista aragonès i el seu cercle un grup de pintures adscrites anteriorment a una hipotètica etapa juvenil de Jaume Huguet que hauria transcorregut a l’Aragó. A la segona part de la tesis es parteix d’aquest nou punt de vista per a revisar el catàleg d’alguns mestres actius a la segona meitat del segle XV, considerats tradicionalment huguetians. S’estudia la figura del Mestre de Sant Jordi i la princesa, Tomás Giner, Arnau de Castelnou, el Mestre de sant Bartomeu, el Grup de Morata i el Mestre de Cervera de la Cañada, entre d’altres. The classic historiography considered that, about {{middle of}} the 15 th century, foreign influences, principally introduced by Jaume Huguet and Bartolomé Bermejo, provoked a strong change in the Aragonese painting, {{which at the time}} was living the last moments of the International Gothic and began to assume some elements of the new Flemish realism. This division of the pictorial Aragonese school of {{the second half of the}} 15 th century in two main tendencies, one of which narrowly linked to the Catalan context, has been re-evaluated by diverse historians throughout last years, and this thesis is inscribed also in this line. In the first part of the thesis I explore the importance of the last International Aragonese Gothic in the formation of some of the painters of the second half of the century, and the introduction of some ingredients of the new Flemish realism, principally across the figure of Master of Riglos, and his connection with one of the masters traditionally labelled as a disciple of Huguet, Pere García de Benavarri. On the other hand, in the last years, some historians have recovered for the catalogue of an Aragonese artist and his circle a group of paintings assigned previously to Jaume Huguet's hypothetical juvenile stage in Aragon. In the second part of this thesis I assume this new approach and I re-evaluate the catalogue of some masters who worked in the second half of the 15 th century, traditionally considered under the influence of Huguet. I examine the figure of the anonymous Master of Saint Georges and the princess, Tomás Giner, Arnau de Castelnou, the Master of san Bartolomew, the Group of Morata and the Master of Cervera de la Cañada, between others...|$|R
