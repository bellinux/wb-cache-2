5|$|Fish are {{consumed}} fresh, {{or may be}} preserved by traditional methods, which include combinations of drying, smoking, and salting, or fermentation. Modern methods of preservation include freezing, freeze-drying, and heat processing (as in canning). Frozen <b>fish</b> <b>products</b> include breaded or battered fillets, fish fingers and fishcakes. Fish meal {{is used as a}} food supplement for farmed fish and for livestock. Fish oils are made either from fish liver, especially rich in vitamins A and D, or from the bodies of oily fish such as sardine and herring, and used as food supplements and to treat vitamin deficiencies.|$|E
5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an animal product, derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher <b>fish</b> <b>products)</b> pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an animal product.|$|E
5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, the roughtail {{stingray}} is listed under Least Concern; {{it is not}} targeted or utilized by commercial fisheries, though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in trawls and on demersal longlines. Historically, it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer. In the Mediterranean, intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail stingray, and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls, longlines, gillnets, and handlines. Though no specific data is available on this species, declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region. In the southwestern Atlantic, the roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls, gillnets, longlines, and hook-and-line; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced <b>fish</b> <b>products.</b> Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing, leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened.|$|E

This accounted for 9 - 10 percent of the country’s total export value (MOFI/USDAFAS, 2007). Home consumption of fish has increased from 11. 8 kg per capital year in 1993, to 13. 5 kg per year in 1995 and is now estimated at more than 19 kg per year (FAO/MOFI, 2003).

Faced with such a shock, how to reduce the production cost of agricultural or fishery products would be an important issue. In the low-profit era, production costs often affect the operation of enterprises in an important factor. In particular, the production cost of agricultural and <b>fishing</b> <b>products,</b> particularly significant. The operating personnel need spend much capital on the stock of goods in the traditional fish industry.

40|$|There {{are many}} optimistic and pessimistic views on {{integrated}} quality management systems based on international standards.

The main research problem is therefore to identify the effect of an IQMS on a fishing company and, secondly, to determine whether such a system is compatible with the fishing industry as a whole. By addressing these questions, a perception of the value of an IQMS for the fishing company under study was be obtained.

25|$|It {{is unclear}} {{to what extent}} fish {{played a role in}} the cuisine, but it is {{apparent}} that fish became steadily more available during the Israelite and Judean monarchies. <b>Fish</b> <b>products</b> were salted and dried and sent great distances. However, even in the later Persian, Greek and Roman periods, the cost of preserving and transporting fish must have meant that only wealthier inhabitants of the highland towns and cities could afford it, or those who lived close to the sources, where it was less expensive. In the Galilee, small-scale fishing was a fundamental component of the agrarian economy.|$|E
25|$|Cyprinids {{are highly}} {{important}} food fish; they are fished and farmed across Eurasia. In land-locked countries in particular, cyprinids {{are often the}} major species of fish eaten because they make the largest part of biomass in most water types except for fast-flowing rivers. In Eastern Europe, they are often prepared with traditional methods, such as drying and salting.
