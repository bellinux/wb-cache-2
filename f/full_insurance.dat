In regard to the campaign's slogan, [...] "Don't risk your life—Rideshare apps are unlawful, unsafe and uninsured", TCQ chief executive Benjamin Wash said in a public statement: [...] "Queensland taxi drivers undergo daily criminal checks, but rideshare drivers don't. You simply don't know who is behind the wheel." [...] Uber responded with information about its insurance policy, including a $US5 million contingency liability insurance cover and [...] "each partner driver's own <b>full</b> <b>insurance</b> policies". The TCQ also {{launched an}} online parliamentary petition to ensure that Uber remains illegal in Queensland, while Emerson said that, since August, the government had issued [...] "more than $170,000 in fines to 62 [...] drivers".|$|E
2500|$|The PAA was due {{to expire}} in 2002, and the former U.S. {{vice-president}} Dick Cheney said in 2001 that [...] "nobody's going to invest in nuclear power plants" [...] if the PAA is not renewed. The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (USNRC) concluded that the liability limits placed on nuclear insurance were significant enough to constitute a subsidy, but a quantification of the amount was not attempted at that time. Shortly after this in 1990, Dubin and Rothwell {{were the first to}} estimate the value to the U.S. nuclear industry of the limitation on liability for nuclear power plants under the Price Anderson Act. Their underlying method was to extrapolate the premiums operators currently pay versus the full liability they would have to pay for <b>full</b> <b>insurance</b> {{in the absence of the}} PAA limits. The size of the estimated subsidy per reactor per year was $60 million prior to the 1982 amendments, and up to $22 million following the 1988 amendments. In a separate article in 2003, Anthony Heyes updates the 1988 estimate of $22 million per year to $33 million (2001 dollars).|$|E

In this paper I test the implications of <b>full</b> consumption <b>insurance</b> using band spectrum regression methods. I argue that moving to the frequency domain provides a possible solution to many difficulties tied to tests of perfect risk sharing. In particular, it provides a unifying framework to test consumption smoothing, both over time and across states of nature. <b>Full</b> consumption <b>insurance</b> is soundly rejected at business cycle frequencies.

5000|$|In public economics, {{specifically}} insurance theory, {{the term}} {{states of the}} world is used to understand why individuals choose to purchase insurance. In an unknown world, with unknown and potentially costly outcomes, people seek to reduce the affects of potentially negative and costly outcomes on their lives. The fundamental notion of insurance theory is that individuals will demand <b>full</b> <b>insurance</b> to fully smooth their consumption over time. Smoothing consumption over time, or, put differently, having consistent consumption regardless of a good or bad outcome, is a [...] utility maximizing behavior. Intuitively, while not having to pay an insurance premium and therefore consuming more in a good state of the world yields high utility, the substantial decrease in utility associated with little consumption in a bad state of the world without insurance, ultimately yields lower utility compared to consistently smooth consumption from year to year, which is obtained by <b>full</b> <b>insurance.</b> Put simply, consumption smoothing across states of the world maximizes utility, which is proven by the expected utility model discussed below.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{collection}} of three essays with contributions to the intergenerational and intra-generational mobility literature. The essay on <b>full</b> risk <b>insurance</b> and measurement error examines the likelihood that measurement error may reconcile observed departures from perfect rank immobility in insurable consumption with the mobility predictions of <b>full</b> risk <b>insurance,</b> by generating spurious rank-breaking transitions. The essay shows that under certain assumptions <b>full</b> risk <b>insurance</b> predicts perfect rank immobility and that there exists ranges of error covariance matrices for which the mobility predictions of <b>full</b> risk <b>insurance</b> plus measurement error can not be rejected in the Peruvian data. A novel approach to test these mobility predictions is presented. The essay on discrete time-states Markov chain models applied to welfare dynamics shows that models with higher order may fit data better than the popular first-order, stationary model, and that the order of the chain, in turn, affects the estimation of equilibrium distributions. A best-practice methodology to conduct homogeneity tests between two samples with different optimal order is proposed, and an index by Shorrocks, based on the trace of the transition matrix, is extended to discrete Markov chain models with higher order. The essay on cohort heterogeneity in intergenerational mobility of education shows how cohort heterogeneity affects the analysis of cross-group homogeneity and long-term prospects of a welfare variable, based on transition matrix analysis. The essay compares the transition matrices of Peruvian groups divided by gender and ethnicity and finds genuine reductions in heterogeneity of the mobility regimes between male and female and between indigenous and non-indigenous groups among the youngest cohorts. The essay proposes a methodology to conduct first-order stochastic dominance analysis with equilibrium distributions and shows that among the youngest cohorts past stochastic dominance of male over females and non-indigenous over indigenous disappear in the long term.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} <b>full</b> deposit <b>insurance</b> introduced in 1994 on the financial performance of Turkish commercial banks. We construct a model, under reasonable assumptions, with deposit insurance where banks undertake excessive risk - moral hazard risk. Empirical investigation using experimental design approach supports our moral hazard hypothesis. Our findings indicate that banks subject to the moral hazard behaviour show significant increases in foreign exchange position risk and deterioration in capital adequacy relative to their benchmark after introduction of <b>full</b> deposit <b>insurance</b> system. We relate this excessive risk-taking to the moral hazard behaviour by commercial banks. The research results indicate that complete deposit insurance system distorts the incentive structure of commercial banks and thus, prevents proper functioning of market discipline mechanism and leads to the taking excessive risk-taking. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} <b>full</b> {{consumption}} <b>insurance</b> posits that households are insulated from all idiosyncratic shocks {{so that the}} ratio of the marginal utilities of consumption of any two households is constant over time. Consumption insurance therefore implies absence of consumption mobility between any two time periods. This implication requires knowledge of the evolution of the entire consumption distribution, not just its mean as in standard tests of complete markets. We test this unexplored prediction of the theory using a panel drawn from the Bank of Italy Survey of Household Income and Wealth. We design an appropriate non-parametric test and find substantial mobility of consumption even controlling for possible preference shifts and measurement error in consumption. The findings strongly reject the theory of <b>full</b> consumption <b>insurance.</b> Consumption insurance, mobility...|$|R

Also the expected insurance efficiency is analyzed in a type of a nonlinear function that may get different values according to its variable (refuse of insuring, <b>full</b> asset <b>insurance,</b> and partial asset loose).

40|$|This article {{considers}} {{the decision to}} purchase insurance against possible losses of a property or wealth. The decision involves a standard economic trade-off between the benefit of protection against loss {{and the cost of}} insurance premium. The premium is paid out of the income and decreases the consumption of other goods and services, rather than out of wealth and decreases the property or wealth. The demand for insurance depends mainly on the income and preferences. As a result, unlike in the standard model, a fair premium is neither necessary nor sufficient for the optimality of <b>full</b> coverage <b>insurance.</b> Rather, the individuals with higher incomes purchase <b>full</b> coverage <b>insurance</b> even at unfair prices of insurance while the individuals with lower income purchase partial coverage insurance at a fair price.
