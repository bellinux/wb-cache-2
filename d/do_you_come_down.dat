He stirred up the Welsh, he has {{encouraged}} the Norwegians, he has intrigued in Northumbria. He and his brother have ever been a source of trouble, and yet he has never openly rebelled; he sets others to do the fighting for him, prepared if they are successful to reap the fruits of their victory. There is, of course, still hope that moderate councils may prevail, but I fear that the Northumbrians will consider that they have gone too far to turn back. At present, at any rate, no steps will be taken. As long as no armed forces are set in motion there are hopes that matters may be arranged, but the approach of an army would set all Northumbria on fire. The Gemot is summoned to meet this day week--that is on the third of October--and we shall wait to hear what steps they take. Messengers have already been sent to a large number of thanes to be prepared for service. I would that all kept a force of housecarls as you do. I am going down to-night to my house near Hampton. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> with me, Wulf. Edith will be glad to see you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Lady Catherine {{has been}} of {{infinite}} use, which ought to make her happy, for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious consequence?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Seriously, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> here?" [...] she insisted. [...] "I {{am not so}} {{absorbed in}} Humphrey's career that I cannot take an {{interest}} in yours. In fact, yours interests me more, because it is more mysterious. Humphrey's," [...] she added, laughing, [...] "is charted from day to day, and announced in bulletins. He is more generous to his friends than--you." ...|$|R
6000|$|Benham {{found himself}} with Amanda upon a side path, a little {{isolated}} by some swaggering artichokes {{and a couple}} of apple trees and so forth from the general conversation. They cut themselves off from the continuation of that by a little silence, and then she spoke abruptly and with the quickness of a speaker who has thought out something to say and fears interruption: [...] "Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> here?" ...|$|R

[...] "You don't know! And you wanted me just now {{to give up my}} arms! That's good, too," [...] cried Brown; [...] "Suppose they say one thing to <b>you,</b> and <b>do</b> the other thing to me."

Mollycoddle, in fact! And what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> advocate? <b>Come</b> <b>down</b> to cases!

[...] "Wind her up, Adolphe." ...|$|R
6000|$|Miss Simcoe, {{for almost}} {{the first time}} in her life, told a lie. [...] "Not at all, John; not at all.

[...] She paused for a moment, and went on: [...] "I begin to see; <b>you</b> <b>did</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> on the stone-boat and Miss Osborn <b>came</b> with <b>you.</b> You were both thrown off by the upset at the wall.

6000|$|... "Don't be alarmed, Myra, we {{are going}} to have a fight, but I have no fear {{whatever}} of their taking us. Only one can attack at once, and he can only come slowly. There are eight of them; you may as well bring me the two other pistols. I would not take them if I thought there was the smallest chance of these fellows getting up here. Go and tell your mother not to be frightened, and then <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> and sit <b>down</b> behind me. I will hand the pistols to you to load. There are only eight of these fellows, and if there were eighty, we could hold the cave; even if they got up to the platform they could only enter, stooping, one at a time. Go at once to your mother, they will be here directly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sometimes we'd have a {{batch of}} college {{students}} Queer lot. Ignorant? Why, they didn't know the catheads from the main brace. But if you took them for fools you'd get bit, sure. They'd learn more in a month than another man would in a year. We had one, once, in the Mary Ann, that came aboard with gold spectacles on. And besides, he was rigged out from main truck to keelson in the nobbiest clothes that ever saw a fo'castle. He had a chestful, too: cloaks, and broadcloth coats, and velvet vests; everything swell, you know; and didn't the saltwater fix them out for him? I guess not! Well, going to sea, the mate {{told him to go}} aloft and help shake out the foreto'gallants'l. Up he shins to the foretop, with his spectacles on, and in a minute <b>down</b> he <b>comes</b> again, looking insulted. Says the mate, 'What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> <b>down</b> for?' Says the chap, 'P'r'aps you didn't notice that there ain't any ladders above there.' You see we hadn't any shrouds above the foretop. The men bursted out in a laugh such as I guess you never heard the like of. Next night, which was dark and rainy, the mate ordered this chap to go aloft about something, and I'm dummed if he didn't start up with an umbrella and a lantern! But no matter; he made a mighty good sailor before the voyage was done, and we had to hunt up something else to laugh at. Years afterwards, when I had forgot all about him, I comes into Boston, mate of a ship, and was loafing around town with the second mate, and it so happened that we stepped into the Revere House, thinking maybe we would chance the salt-horse in that big diningroom for a flyer, as the boys say. Some fellows were talking just at our elbow, and one says, 'Yonder's the new governor of Massachusetts--at that table over there with the ladies.' We took a good look my mate and I, for we hadn't either of us ever see a governor before. I looked and looked at that face {{and then all of a}} sudden it popped on me! But didn't give any sign. Says I, 'Mate, I've a notion to go over and shake hands with him.' Says he 'I think I see <b>you</b> <b>doing</b> it, Tom.' Says I, 'Mate I'm a-going to do it.' Says he, 'Oh, yes, I guess so. Maybe you don't want to bet you will, Tom?' Say I, 'I don't mind going a V on it, mate.' Says he 'Put it up.' 'Up she goes,' says I, planking the cash. This surprised him. But he covered it, and says pretty sarcastic, 'Hadn't you better take your grub with the governor and the ladies, Tom?' Says I 'Upon second thoughts, I will.' Says he, 'Well Tom, you aye a dum fool.' Says I, 'Maybe I am maybe I ain't; but the main question is, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> wan to risk two and a half that I won't do it?' 'Make it a V,' says he. 'Done,' says I. I started, him a giggling and slapping his hand on his thigh, he felt so good. I went over there and leaned my knuckle: on the table a minute and looked the governor in the face, and says I, 'Mr. Gardner, don't you know me? He stared, and I stared, and he stared. Then all of a sudden he sings out, 'Tom Bowling, by the holy poker! Ladies, it's old Tom Bowling, that you've heard me talk about--shipmate of mine in the Mary Ann.' He rose up and shook hands with me ever so hearty--I sort of glanced around and took a realizing sense of my mate's saucer eyes--and then says the governor, 'Plant yourself, Tom, plant yourself; you can't cat your anchor again till you've had a feed with me and the ladies!' I planted myself alongside the governor, and canted my eye around toward my mate. Well, sir, his dead-lights were bugged out like tompions; and his mouth stood that wide open that you could have laid a ham in it without him noticing it." ...|$|R

'At {{last the}} tide flowed, {{silencing}} the plaint and {{the cries of}} pain, and the dawn was near when Brown, sitting with his chin {{in the palm of}} his hand before Patusan, as one might stare at the unscalable side of a mountain, heard the brief ringing bark of a brass 6-pounder far away in town somewhere. [...] "What's this?" [...] he asked of Cornelius, who hung about him. Cornelius listened. A muffled roaring shout rolled down-river over the town; a big drum began to throb, and others responded, pulsating and droning. Tiny scattered lights began to twinkle in the dark half of the town, while the part lighted by the loom of fires hummed with a deep and prolonged murmur. [...] "He has come," [...] said Cornelius. [...] "What? Already? Are you sure?" [...] Brown asked. [...] "Yes! yes! Sure. Listen to the noise." [...] "What are they making that row about?" [...] pursued Brown. [...] "For joy," [...] snorted Cornelius; [...] "he is a very great man, but all the same, he knows no more than a child, and so they make a great noise to please him, because they know no better." [...] "Look here," [...] said Brown, [...] "how is one to get at him?" [...] "He shall come to talk to you," [...] Cornelius declared. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean? <b>Come</b> <b>down</b> here strolling as it were?" [...] Cornelius nodded vigorously in the dark. [...] "Yes. He will come straight here and talk to you. He is just like a fool. You shall see what a fool he is." [...] Brown was incredulous. [...] "You shall see; you shall see," [...] repeated Cornelius. [...] "He is not afraid--not afraid of anything. He will <b>come</b> and order <b>you</b> to leave his people alone. Everybody must leave his people alone. He is like a little child. He will <b>come</b> to <b>you</b> straight." [...] Alas! he knew Jim well--that [...] "mean little skunk," [...] as Brown called him to me. [...] "Yes, certainly," [...] he pursued with ardour, [...] "and then, captain, you tell that tall man with a gun to shoot him. Just you kill him, and you will frighten everybody so much that <b>you</b> can <b>do</b> anything <b>you</b> like with them afterwards--get what you like--go away when you like. Ha! ha! ha! Fine [...] ." [...] He almost danced with impatience and eagerness; and Brown, looking over his shoulder at him, could see, shown up by the pitiless dawn, his men drenched with dew, sitting amongst the cold ashes and the litter of the camp, haggard, cowed, and in rags.' ...|$|R

They’re playing “Ain’t Misbehavin’” over the radio. Boy honey, that’s no lie, ah ain’t- (ah can’t). Well anyhow they’re letting their little boys have beer tonight since we’ve been good all week. Gosh darling, the time is going so slow. I guess it’s because I don’t do anything all day around here. It seems like I haven’t seen you in weeks. And it’s only been four days. Honey, I think I’ll go nuts for the next 14. I miss you more now than I ever did while I was at Spence. Next weekend I’m going to try to get off if possible. I’m going to speak to the C. O. (only a 1 st LT.). And maybe honey, if I <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> could <b>come</b> <b>down</b> to Pensacola and I could meet you there. There’s no possible way you can even telegraph me so I’m just assuming you want to or can make it, darling. So if I can I will telegraph you Thursday night, the 22 nd you’ll probably get it Friday morning. I’ll send it in care of the Albert Hotel, O. K. I you don’t hear from me, don’t <b>come</b> <b>down,</b> but if <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> try to get to Pensacola Friday night so you can get a room, it’s very crowded, sticky with the Naivey! Stay in the largest hotel in town, ask someone which is, thank I can find you easily, honey. And if I can’t find you by 11 o’clock Saturday night call the U. S. O. in Pensacola and leave a message there. You’d better do that in the first place and I’ll go right there. And if there’s no U. S. O. just stay in the hotel. That’s the only thing I can think of honey, since there is no possible way for you to reach me here. So if I can make it I’ll telegraph you Thursday. Gosh I hope I can darling I miss you so much. And love you much more. It’s so awful being away from you. I love you darling with all my heart and soul. I will be that way- always. Your devoted husband. Judd P. S. I just found out that you can telegraph me here, just send it to Craig and it will get to me here O. K. I love you my darling. [Translation ends...|$|R
