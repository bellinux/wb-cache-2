5000|$|A <b>debit</b> <b>note</b> or debit {{memorandum}} (memo) is {{a commercial}} document issued by a buyer to a seller {{as a means}} of formally requesting a credit note. A seller might also issue a <b>debit</b> <b>note</b> instead of an invoice in order to adjust upwards the amount of an invoice already issued (as if the invoice is recorded in wrong value).Debit notes are generally used in business-to-business transactions. Such transactions often involve an extension of credit, meaning that a vendor would send a shipment of goods to a company before the goods have been paid for. Although real goods are changing hands, until an actual invoice is issued, real money is not. Rather, debits and credits are being logged in an accounting system to keep track of inventories shipped and payments ...|$|E
50|$|The Einzugsermächtigung ("direct debit authorisation") just {{requires}} the customer {{to authorize the}} payee to make the collection. This can happen in written form, orally, by e-mail or through a web interface {{set up by the}} payee. Although organisations are generally required not to instruct their banks to make unauthorised collections, this is usually not verified by the banks involved. Customers can instruct their bank to return the <b>debit</b> <b>note</b> within at least six weeks.|$|E

The payee is then notified {{that he or she}} is now authorised to initiate Direct Debit transfers from the payer. While this is more secure in theory, it can also mean for the payer that it is harder to return <b>debit</b> <b>notes</b> in the case of an error or dispute.|$|R

A month before, in June, the Compagnie Française des Pétroles rejoined the partnership by taking over two-thirds of Partex's equity share, resulting in the following shareholding in the company that by then had {{changed its name to}} Petroleum Development (Oman): Shell 85%, Compagnie Francaise des Petroles 10% and Partex 5%.|$|E
50|$|One method {{involves}} {{only the}} payer and the payee, with the payer authorizing the payee to collect amounts due {{on his or}} her account. However, the payer can instruct his or her bank to return any Direct <b>Debit</b> <b>note</b> without giving a reason. In that event, the payee has to pay all fees for the transaction and may eventually lose his or her ability to initiate Direct Debits if this occurs too often. However, it still requires all the account holders (not merely the payer) to watch statements and request returns if necessary, unless they have instructed their bank to block all Direct Debits.|$|E
50|$|To {{avoid the}} {{processing}} fees, many businesses resorted to using direct debit, {{which is then}} called electronic direct debit (Elektronisches Lastschriftverfahren, abbr. ELV). The point-of-sale terminal reads the bank sort code and account number from the card but instead of handling the transaction through the Girocard network it simply prints a form, which the customer signs to authorise the <b>debit</b> <b>note.</b> However, this method also avoids any verification or payment guarantee provided by the network. Further, customers can return debit notes by notifying their bank without giving a reason. This means that the beneficiary bears the risk of fraud and illiquidity. Some business mitigate the risk by consulting a proprietary blacklist or by switching to Girocard for higher transaction amounts.|$|E
50|$|The Abbuchungsauftrag ("posting off") {{requires}} the customer to instruct {{his or her}} bank to honour <b>debit</b> <b>notes</b> from the organisation. Direct debits made with this method are verified by the customer's bank and therefore can not be returned.

50|$|Electronic {{invoicing}} (also called e-invoicing) {{is a form}} {{of electronic}} billing. E-invoicing methods are used by trading partners, such as customers and their suppliers, to present and monitor transactional documents between one another and ensure the terms of their trading agreements are being met. These documents include invoices, purchase orders, <b>debit</b> <b>notes,</b> credit notes, payment terms and instructions, and remittance slips.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} years the {{optimisation}} of business processes has gained more and more importance {{in the context of}} modernising public administrations. In line with the concept of electronic government (eGovernment) citizens demand not only an improved design of internet sites, but also the creation of real added value to administrational services. In dimensions of benefits (from the citizen’s point of view) and in dimensions of cost reduction (from the administrations ’ point of view) the added value can be generated by providing fully transactional online citizen services. The establishment of such services should be supported by reorganising the underlying business processes in terms of process organisation and enabling ICT. Approximately 13, 000 German municipalities mainly {{have to deal with the}} same spectrum of tasks. The administration processes that are necessary to fulfil those tasks share strong structural analogies. Within process oriented reorganisation projects, reference models can contribute to cost reduction in the phase of to-be modelling. Aim of this paper is to present experiences in applying reference modelling within the process oriented reorganisation project Regio@KomM in public administrations. The reorganisation of the process of issuing a general <b>debit</b> <b>note</b> authorisation exemplifies the practical applicability and the value potential of reference modelling in public administrations...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} 5 - 6 years a strong reform {{orientation}} of the Republic of Macedonia (RM) to improve the business climate in {{the country has been}} present. However, the economic/legal system of the Republic still has many weaknesses and limitations that does not allow the economical entities to smoothly carry out their activities and even limits their achievement of significant business results. In particular, they are manifested by the difficulties in the collection of claims. Very effective solution for overcoming the problems of (non) payment of obligations is to establish a system of automatic payment of liabilities (SAP). The basis for the introduction of this system is the introduction of a new instrument for payment or securing of payments in the RM – a <b>debit</b> <b>note.</b> It would be an instrument which is issued by the debtor {{at the request of the}} creditor in order to regulate their mutual debtor-creditor relations. The underlying logic of this instrument is the possibility to realize and/or guarantee payment of debt. It carries out the role of an off-court settlement instrument between the parties. The establishment and proper functioning of SAP would mean a kind of revolution in payment. It will increase mutual trust between the economic entities, as a result of which Macedonia will become a reliable and secure destination for the funds of investors. ...|$|E

50|$|To prevent abuse, account holders must {{watch their}} bank {{statements}} and ask their bank to return unauthorised (or wrong) <b>debit</b> <b>notes.</b> As fraudulent direct debit instructions are easily traced, abuse is rare. However, {{there can be}} issues when the amount billed and collected is incorrect or unexpectedly large. There have also been cases of fraudulent direct debit where the defrauders tried to collect very small individual sums from large numbers of accounts, {{in the hope that}} most account holders would be slow to raise an issue about such small sums, giving the defrauders enough time to withdraw the collected money and disappear.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{legislative}} {{developments in}} the field of payment services in the European Union aim at building a uniform European payments market. The creation of an internal market for payments has been the result of both industry self-regulation and public regulation. The Payment Services Directive (PSD) and Regulation 924 / 2009 support and complement the private regulatory regime developed by the banking sector's European Payments Council, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The PSD provides a legal framework for SEPA by harmonizing certain core payments provisions, while Regulation 924 / 2009 substantially enabled the launch of SEPA Direct Debit by laying down the principle of “reachability” for cross-border direct debit payments and by regulating multilateral interchange fees in direct <b>debit</b> transactions. This <b>Note</b> describes in further detail the PSD, Regulation 924 / 2009, and their relation to SEPA...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: A state {{register}} that stores {{the state}} of the Turing machine, one of finitely many. There is one special start state with which the state register is initialized. These states, writes Turing, replace the "state of mind " a person performing computations would ordinarily be in. It is like bank ledger, which has <b>Debits</b> and Credits. <b>Note</b> that in double entry computation, both debits and credits are entered in to the systems, namely the Bank Ledger and balance is posted. Individual Debits are equivalent to individual credits. On a generalizational and globalist scale, a “General Ledger ” is written which records in all its wide ranging manifestation the Debits and Credits. This is also conservative. In other words Assets is equivalent to Liabilities. True, Profit is distributed among overheads and charges, and there shall be another account in the General ledger that is the account of Profit. This account is credited with the amount earned as commission, exchange, or discount of bills. Now when we write the “General Ledger ” of Turing machine, the Primma Donna and terra firma of the model, we are writing the General Theory of all the variables that are incorporated in the model. So for every variable, we have an anti variable. This is the dissipation factor. Conservation laws do hold well in computers. They do not break the conservation laws. Thus energy is not dissipated in to the atmosphere when computation is being performed. To repeat we are suggesting a General Theory Of working of a simple Computer and in further papers, we want to extend this theory to both nanotechnology and Quantum Computation. Turing’s work is the proponent, precursor, primogeniture, progenitor and promethaleon for the development of Quantum Computers. Computers follow conservation laws. This work is one whic...|$|R
5000|$|Vouching can be {{described}} as the essence or backbone of auditing. The success of an audit depends on the thoroughness with which vouching is done. After entering in all vouchers, only then can auditing start. Vouching is defined as the [...] "verification of entries in the books of account by examination of documentary evidence or vouchers, such as invoices, <b>debit</b> and credit <b>notes,</b> statements, receipts, etc. The object of vouching is to establish that the transactions recorded in the books of accounts are (1) in order and have been properly authorized and (2) are correctly recorded. “Simple routine checking cannot establish the same accuracy that vouching can. In routine checking, entries recorded in the books only show what information the bookkeeper chooses to disclose, however these entries can be fictitious without any vouching or vouchers. By using a vouching or a voucher system a company will have concrete and solid documentation and evidence of expenses, capital, and written proof in audits. [...] Vouching is the essence or backbone of auditing because when performing an audit, an auditor must have proof of all transactions. Without the proof provided by vouching, the claims provided by the auditor are just that, only claims. In most cases, hard to detect frauds can only be discovered through the use of vouching. This means that the auditor must conduct vouching with great importance, if not, he can be charged with negligence which happened in the case of Armitage v. Brewer and Knott. Through this case, the importance of vouching was realized. In this case, the auditors were found to be guilty on negligence, because the auditors did not display enough reasonable care and skill in vouching the wage sheets and ended up failing to detect fraud in manipulation of these wage records and cash vouchers. When delivering the decision the Judge stated that [...] "It was clear that a good many documents were suspicious on either face and called for Inquiry". It was declared that it was essential that due care and attention are to be given to vouching in auditing.|$|R
