5|$|The New York Automobile Club {{released}} another plan in 1933. This plan made {{no changes}} to NY9A; however, US9 {{was changed to}} use Broadway {{all the way through}} the Bronx and to travel to New Jersey by way of the Holland Tunnel. In the final plan implemented in mid-December 1934, no route was assigned to the Harlem River Drive–Amsterdam Avenue corridor. Instead, NY9A used what had been planned as US9, splitting at Broadway and Dyckman Street. NY9A ran south along the west side of Manhattan on Riverside Drive and the West Side Elevated Highway (<b>detouring</b> around an unfinished section via 57th Street, Eleventh Avenue and 48th Street) to end at the entrance and exit plazas of the Holland Tunnel. US9 was shifted northward to enter New Jersey via the George Washington Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Populations from Los Baños {{and from}} Sagada, {{both in the}} Philippines, have {{slightly}} different hunting tactics, and Los Baños has some very dangerous prey spiders. In laboratory tests, Los Baños P. labiatas rely more on trial and error than Sagada P. labiatas in finding ways to vibrate the prey's web and thus lure or distract the prey. Around Los Baños the web-building Scytodes pallida, which preys on jumping spiders, is very abundant. All members of the genus Scytodes spit a sticky gum on prey and potential threats, and this can immobilise a Portia {{long enough for the}} Scytodes to wrap the Portia in silk and then bite it. Around Los Baños, P. labiata instinctively detours round the back of S. pallida that is not carrying eggs while with plucking the web {{in a way that makes}} S. pallida believe the threat is in front of it. P. labiata prefers to stalk a female S. pallida carrying eggs, as then S. pallida is reluctant to drop the eggs in order to spit, and in this case P. labiata sometimes uses a direct attack. In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of plucking other spiders' webs to deceive the prey and <b>detouring</b> for a stab in the back.|$|E

25|$|Following an {{invitation}} {{issued by the}} SEF at the first meeting, the head of ARATS, Chen Yunlin, began a visit to Taiwan on 3 November 2008. Items on the agenda raised by SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung included direct maritime shipping, chartered cargo flights, direct postal service, and co-operation in ensuring food safety, {{in response to the}} 2008 Chinese milk scandal, while ARATS chairman Chen Yunlin raised the matters of direct freight service, and opening up air routes that directly cross the Taiwan Strait. Previous routes avoided crossing the Strait for security reasons, with planes <b>detouring</b> through Hong Kong or Japan air control areas.|$|E
25|$|Early {{completely}} artificial canals, across fairly flat countryside, {{would get}} round {{a small hill}} or depression by simply <b>detouring</b> (contouring) around it. As engineers became more ambitious {{in the types of}} country they felt they could overcome, locks became essential to effect the necessary changes in water level without detours that would be completely uneconomic both in building costs and journey time. Later still, as construction techniques improved, engineers became more willing to cut directly through and across obstacles by constructing long tunnels, cuttings, aqueducts or embankments, or to construct even more technical devices such as inclined planes or boat lifts. However, locks continued to be built to supplement these solutions, and are an essential part of even the most modern navigable waterways.|$|E
25|$|The second Juan Bautista de Anza {{expedition}} (1775–76), entering Alta California {{from the}} southeast (crossing the Colorado River near today's Yuma, Arizona) picked up Portolá's trail at Mission San Gabriel. De Anza's scouts found easier traveling in several inland valleys, rather than {{staying on the}} rugged coast. On his journey north, de Anza traveled the San Fernando Valley and Salinas Valley. After <b>detouring</b> to the coast to visit the Presidio of Monterey, de Anza went inland again, following the Santa Clara Valley to {{the southern end of}} San Francisco Bay and on up {{the east side of the}} San Francisco Peninsula. This became the preferred route (roughly today's U.S Route 101), and more closely corresponds to the officially recognized El Camino Real.|$|E
25|$|The Lazarević–Branković {{conflict}} {{became an}} opportunity for the Ottomans, who readied for war, to regain the power they had once wielded in the Balkans. A Serbian contingent returning home from Asia Minor was abruptly attacked and destroyed near Edirne on the orders of an Ottoman commander. It became clear to Lazarević that the rest of his army could not return using that route. Branković and the Ottomans sought to prevent Lazarević and his brother Vuk from returning home. Branković's forces were joined by an Ottoman contingent, ordered by Süleyman to take control of local roads and prevent the Lazarević brother's crossing, which was expected to take place in the Branković-controlled territory of Kosovo. Still mistrustful of Branković's intentions, Süleyman sent one of his commanders to monitor Branković, to ensure that he was truly loyal. The Lazarević brothers and a detachment of about 260 men left Constantinople and embarked for the coast of Zeta by ship. Before landing in Zeta, Lazarević had become aware of Branković's plans; the brothers prepared for battle. They met with their brother-in-law Đurađ II Balšić, who supported them militarily, and had their mother Milica raise an army in the Despotate. Lazarević's army made its way inland in late October 1402, on <b>detouring</b> roads towards the Žiča monastery. Branković's forces and the Ottoman contingent gathered near the Gračanica Monastery.|$|E

In areas where S. pallida is absent, the local members of P. labiata do not use this combination of deception and <b>detouring</b> for a stab in the back. In a test to explore P. labiata′s ability to solve a novel problem, a miniature lagoon was set up, and the spiders had to find the best way to cross it. Specimens from Sagada, in the mountains, almost always repeated the first option they tried, even when that was unsuccessful. When specimens from Los Baños, beside a lake, were unsuccessful the first time, about three quarters switched to another option.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2004, the {{expressway}} {{was shut}} down between Lower Nazareth Township (Route 248) and Stockertown (Route 191) because of a sinkhole {{that was in the}} area of the Bushkill Creek directly under a northbound bridge support beam. [...] Crossovers were created, narrowing the highway to one lane in each direction through Stockertown. [...] Studies were conducted, and came to the conclusion that the bridge was dangerous and could not be fixed. [...] The northbound bridge was demolished in February of the same year. [...] Just 21 days later, a sinkhole was discovered under the southbound bridge over the Bushkill Creek, and resulted in the demolition of the southbound bridge. [...] Once the new northbound bridge was completed, another crossover was created, <b>detouring</b> southbound traffic onto the northbound side of the highway. [...] On April 21, 2004, a depression formed under the new northbound bridge, and the highway {{was shut down}} once again to fill the area with bituminous material. [...] The bridge re-opened within twenty minutes. [...] By November 19, 2004, both bridges were completed and opened. [...] All of this happened feet from the Bushkill Street Bridge, which connects Stockertown and Palmer Township, and has been closed since 1999 because of numerous sinkholes causing the bridge to collapse.|$|E
