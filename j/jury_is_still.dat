25|$|Leibniz {{also wrote}} a short paper, Primae veritates, first {{published}} by Louis Couturat in 1903 (pp.518–523) summarizing {{his views on}} metaphysics. The paper is undated; that he wrote it while in Vienna in 1689 was determined only in 1999, when the ongoing critical edition finally published Leibniz's philosophical writings for the period 1677–90. Couturat's reading {{of this paper was}} the launching point for much 20th-century thinking about Leibniz, especially among analytic philosophers. But after a meticulous study of all of Leibniz's philosophical writings up to 1688—a study the 1999 additions to the critical edition made possible—Mercer (2001) begged to differ with Couturat's reading; the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> out.|$|E

500|$|A {{number of}} words in common use at the time {{are thought to be}} {{possible}} sources for the name [...] "cricket". In the earliest known reference to the sport in 1598, it is called creckett. Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff. In what may be an early reference to the sport, a 1533 poem attributed to John Skelton describes Flemish weavers as [...] "kings of crekettes", a word of apparent Middle Dutch origin. In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary of the English Language (1755), he derived cricket from [...] "cryce, Saxon, a stick". In Old French, the word criquet seems to have meant a kind of club or stick, though this may have been the origin of croquet. Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word krickstoel, meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church, the shape of which resembled the two stump wicket used in early cricket. According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, [...] "cricket" [...] derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., [...] "with the stick chase"). Gillmeister believes the sport itself had a Flemish origin but [...] "the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> out" [...] on the matter.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic {{said that the}} plot of the episode had a [...] "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a [...] "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> out on Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E

[...] The Court has also held that a corporation's custodian of records can be forced to produce corporate documents even if the act of production would incriminate him personally. [...] The only limitation on this rule is that the jury cannot be told that the custodian personally produced those documents in any subsequent prosecution of him, but the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> allowed to draw adverse inferences from {{the content of the}} documents combined with the position of the custodian in the corporation.|$|E
2500|$|According to David McAlpin, the Dravidian {{languages}} {{were brought}} to India by immigration into India from Elam, located in present-day southwestern Iran. In the 1990s, Renfrew and Cavalli-Sforza have also argued that Proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent, but more recently Heggerty and Renfrew noted that [...] "McAlpin's analysis of the language data, and thus his claims, remain far from orthodoxy", adding that Fuller finds no relation of Dravidian language with other languages, and thus assumes it to be native to India.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{derivation}} of the American jury system from the English jury of Henry II. To this end, a short history of English law {{and the history of}} the development of the English <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> given. The method of the English <b>jury's</b> development <b>is</b> used to show the evolution of the early American jury into the American jury of today. The American jury still resembles the English jury from which it evolved. The American system has a grand jury to indict criminals and a petit jury to try the case. The practice of taking an oath was begun by the English jurors and <b>is</b> <b>still</b> in practice in American today as well as the challenging of potential jurors for bias. The American system differs from the juries of old in its inability to determine matters of law and in its move away from unanimity in verdicts and the twelve-man jury. Some of the aspects of the historical English <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> in use in the American jury system of today, but some differences have been created through case law and legislation. It will come to no surprise, however, that the most important characteristics of the historical English <b>jury</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> present in the American system today.

25|$|Historically, a country's {{votes were}} decided by an {{internal}} jury, but in 1997 five countries (Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Sweden and the United Kingdom) experimented with televoting, giving {{members of the}} public in those countries the opportunity to vote en masse for their favourite songs. The experiment was a success, and from 1998 onwards all countries were encouraged to use televoting wherever possible. Back-up <b>juries</b> <b>are</b> <b>still</b> used by each country, {{in the event of a}} televoting failure. Nowadays {{members of the public}} may also vote by SMS, in addition to televoting.

2500|$|According to Heggarty and Renfrew, Dravidian {{languages}} {{may have}} spread into the Indian subcontinent with {{the spread of}} farming. According to David McAlpin, the Dravidian languages were brought to India by immigration into India from Elam. In earlier publications, Renfrew also stated that proto-Dravidian was brought to India by farmers from the Iranian part of the Fertile Crescent, but more recently Heggarty and Renfrew note that [...] "a great deal {{remains to be done}} in elucidating the prehistory of Dravidian." [...] They also note that [...] "McAlpin's analysis of the language data, and thus his claims, remain far from orthodoxy."

Egan said that [...] "The sequencing is bizarre but has its own kind of logic, working backwards chronologically" [...] and as [...] "the familiar tunes go by, one is {{struck by the fact}} that Williams is both underrated [...] and overrated." [...] He also stated that had Williams [...] "not been sacked by Take That, he would never have been motivated to prove himself with edgy, knowing music light years beyond the boyband."

2500|$|At {{the time}} of The Golden Compass {{theatrical}} release, Chris Weitz pledged to [...] "protect [...] integrity" [...] of the prospective sequels by being [...] "much less compromising" [...] in the book-to-film adaptation process. New Line Cinema commissioned Hossein Amini to write a screenplay based on the second book in the trilogy, The Subtle Knife, potentially for release in 2010 or 2011, with the third book of the trilogy, The Amber Spyglass, to follow. However, New Line president Toby Emmerich stressed that production of {{the second and third}} films was dependent on the financial success of The Golden Compass. When The Golden Compass did not meet expectations at the United States box office, the likelihood of a sequel was downplayed by New Line. According to studio co-head Michael Lynne, [...] "The <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> very much out on the movie, and while it's performed very strongly overseas we'll look at it early 2008 and see where we're going with a sequel." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{success of}} Trial by Jury spurred several {{attempts}} to reunite Gilbert and Sullivan, but difficulties arose. [...] Plans for a collaboration for Carl Rosa in 1875 fell through because Gilbert {{was too busy}} with other projects, and an attempted Christmas 1875 revival of Thespis by Richard D'Oyly Carte failed when the financiers backed out. [...] Gilbert and Sullivan continued their separate careers, though both continued writing light opera, among other projects: Sullivan's next light opera, The Zoo, opened while Trial by <b>Jury</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> playing, in June 1875; and Gilbert's Eyes and No Eyes premiered a month later, followed by Princess Toto in 1876.

He obviously didn't mean the things he said then – he just said them {{in the heat of the}} moment, but those words have stuck with Kat." [...] Asked whether Alfie appreciates Kat's honesty, he replied: [...] "Not at all – he'd rather not know. Deep down, Alfie knows that Kat has done things in the past that maybe she shouldn't have, but he didn't know all the details. Now he knows Kat has been unfaithful, he has got to confront the fact. The <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> out on that one," [...] he explained. [...] "I don't know, if I'm honest. They always seem to take two steps forward and then one step back...

The show at Spectrum London was the Stuckists' first {{show in a}} commercial gallery in the West End of London. The Spectrum London director, Royden Prior, said people shouldn't {{just look at the}} politics, but should look beyond them because [...] "These artists are good, and are part of art history," [...] Jane Morris wrote in The Guardian, [...] "If the stuckists go down in art history, and the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> out as to whether they will, Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision by stuckist co-founder Charles Thomson may well become their signature piece." [...] The Evening Standard said some people would see the display of the painting as revenge against Serota, after he had rejected the Stuckists' offer to donate work to the Tate; it also mentioned that the Stuckists had first drawn attention to the Tate's purchase of The Upper Room by Chris Ofili, a Tate trustee, which had led to the Tate being censured by the Charity Commission in 2006.|$|E
2500|$|The court {{established}} {{that in fact}} the due process clause of the 5th and 14th amendments prohibits the shackling of a defendant during the sentencing phase of a trial. The court made this determination by looking at important facts or legal standards. The court noted that shackling a defendant undermines the presumption of innocence, since shackling tells jurors that the person being shackled is dangerous {{and needs to be}} restrained. Breyer also noted that shackling a defendant hurts his ability to interact with his attorneys, and prevents a defendant from taking the witness stand. The principle of court dignity also came up in the opinion of the court. The court stated, “The routine use of shackles in the presence of juries would undermine these symbolic yet concrete objectives.” [...] By making these conclusions about shackling a defendant, the court ruled “the considerations that militate against the routine use of visible shackles during the guilt phase of a criminal trial apply with like force to penalty proceedings in capital cases.” This deals with the fact the in these cases, the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> deciding between life and death and that this is a decision of equal importance compared to the question of innocence and guilt. The decision of life or death in the sentencing phase is serious which requires reliable sentencing. According to Justice Breyer, the court has “stressed the ‘acute need’ for reliable decision making when the death penalty is at issue.” [...] Breyer stated that in Deck’s case his right to reliable sentencing was infringed upon (a right derived from the Eight Amendment).|$|E

[...] "I've been involved with many projects over the years, and I can tell you the response to this has been overwhelming." [...] But retail consultant, Dalan Bronson of the J.C.
