40|$|Realistic {{rendering}} requires computing {{the global}} illumination in the scene, and Monte Carlo integration is the best-known method for doing that. The key to good performance is to carefully select the costly integration samples, {{which is usually}} achieved via importance sampling. Unfortunately, visibility is difficult to factor into the importance distribution, which can greatly increase variance in highly occluded scenes with complex illumination. In this paper, we present importance caching – a novel approach that selects those samples with a distribution that <b>includes</b> <b>visibility,</b> while maintaining efficiency by exploiting illumination smoothness. At a sparse set of locations in the scene, we construct and cache several types of probability distributions {{with respect to a}} set of virtual point lights (VPLs), which notably <b>include</b> <b>visibility.</b> Each distribution type is optimized for a specific lighting condition. For every shading point, we then borrow the distributions from nearby cached locations and use them for VPL sampling, avoiding additional bias. A novel multiple importance sampling framework finally combines the many estimators. In highly occluded scenes, where visibility is a major source of variance in the incident radiance, our approach can reduce variance by more than an order of magnitude. Even in such complex scenes we can obtain accurate and low noise previews with full global illumination in a couple of seconds on a single mid-range CPU.

40|$|The {{practice}} of evaluating interaction with devices {{is embedded in}} disciplines such as human-computer interaction and cognitive <b>ergonomics,</b> <b>including</b> concepts such as affordances, error analysis, skill, rule and knowledge based behaviour and decision making biases. This paper considers {{the way in which}} the approach that has been routinely applied to displays and control design within the control and transport domains can be transferred to the context of medical devices. The importance of considering the context in which medical devices are used and implemented is presented, and the need for a systems approach to medical device design is emphasised. Five case studies from medical device control and display design are presented as an aide to developing an understanding of the relationship between device design and resultant behaviours. On the basis of these case studies, four types of mediating factors (catalysts, enablers, facilitators and enhancers) are proposed and a model to describe the link between device design, user, context and consequences is presented...|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} Restricted Access. The article was {{published}} in the journal, Theoretical Issues in Ergonomics Science [© Taylor & Francis] and is available at: [URL] primary objective of the study reported in this paper was to look at the use of qualitative methodology in ergonomics research and practice. Qualitative methodology itself was chosen as a compatible approach to explore these aims, with ergonomics being seen as a socially situated practice. Semi-structured interviews were carried out using a prompt sheet which developed iteratively during the study. A four stage sampling procedure was used to gain access to 21 interviewees. These stages were (1) spreading the net (purposive sampling), (2) following up leads (snowball sampling), (3) focussing (intensity sampling), and (4) analysis sampling to seek out extreme/deviant cases. A total of 12 academics and 9 practitioners were interviewed from all areas of <b>ergonomics,</b> <b>including</b> cognitive (psychology), product design, engineering, human and health sciences, organisational management and sociology. The findings are represented by a model showing the interactions between multiple dimensions, including academia/practice, qualitative/ quantitative and the internal and external environments of ergonomics. There was considerable interest in expanding the <b>ergonomics</b> toolbox to <b>include</b> qualitative methodology. However concerns were raised about a perceived lack of knowledge with respect to the process, which could be addressed through education and reflective practice...|$|R

This study included 52 volunteers unaffected by color blindness, 28 female and 24 male, ranging in age from 18 to 53, with an average age of 22. 9 years. The experimental stimuli (nine chromatic and three achromatic) were applied to six different appliances. All of them were presented on a computer screen, one at a time, in random order. A continuous scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (very much) indicated to what extent the viewer liked the image. In general, for all the electric appliances, a greater preference was found for achromatic colors, especially white (77. 2) and black (73. 7), with similar scores. Even gray (58. 5) surpassed the most preferred chromatic color, which was blue, with a score of 46. 9.
