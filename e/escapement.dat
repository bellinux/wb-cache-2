5|$|The {{earliest}} known clock with a water-powered <b>escapement</b> mechanism, which transferred {{rotational energy}} into intermittent motions, {{dates back to}} 3rd century in ancient Greece; Chinese engineers later invented clocks incorporating mercury-powered <b>escapement</b> mechanisms in the 10th century, followed by Iranian engineers inventing water clocks driven by gears and weights in the 11th century.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Tompion was {{the first}} English clockmaker with an {{international}} reputation {{and many of his}} pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as George Graham who invented the deadbeat <b>escapement,</b> orrery and mercury pendulum, and his pupil Thomas Mudge who created the first lever <b>escapement.</b> Famous clockmakers of this period included Joseph Windmills, Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and Christopher Pinchbeck who used the Pinchbeck alloy.|$|E
5|$|During the 11th {{century in}} the Song Dynasty, the Chinese astronomer, horologist and {{mechanical}} engineer Su Song created a water-driven astronomical clock for his clock tower of Kaifeng City. It incorporated an <b>escapement</b> mechanism {{as well as the}} earliest known endless power-transmitting chain drive, which drove the armillary sphere.|$|E
5000|$|The Manufacture's {{reputation}} {{defined it}} {{as both the}} leader and a reference in <b>escapements.</b> The company's annual production of platform <b>escapements</b> gradually increased over two decades, culminating at 200,000 platform <b>escapements</b> in 1889—nothing short of exceptional for the time! ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Escapements</b> {{are used}} {{elsewhere}} as well. Manual typewriters used <b>escapements</b> to step the carriage as each letter (or space) was typed.|$|R
5000|$|By {{this time}} {{the idea of the}} Roskopf-type watch was {{becoming}} popular in Switzerland and a number of Swiss companies began making [...] "Roskopf" [...] watches. In order to be really cheap, the watches had to be machine mass manufactured as much as possible. These watches had pin-pallet <b>escapements</b> rather than platform <b>escapements.</b>|$|R
5|$|In England, the {{manufacturing}} of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also {{known as the}} grandfather clock) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor <b>escapement</b> mechanism in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge <b>escapement</b> mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid {{the need for a}} very large case, most clocks using the verge <b>escapement</b> had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39inches) long {{to the center of the}} bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman {{engineer}} Taqi al-Din {{described a}} weight-driven clock with a verge-and-foliot <b>escapement,</b> a striking train of gears, an alarm, and {{a representation of}} the moon's phases in his book The Brightest Stars for the Construction of Mechanical Clocks (Al-Kawākib al-durriyya fī wadh' al-bankāmat al-dawriyya), written around 1556.|$|E
5|$|In 1612, having {{determined}} the orbital periods of Jupiter's satellites, Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate {{knowledge of their}} orbits, one could use their positions as a universal clock, and this would make possible the determination of longitude. He worked on this problem {{from time to time}} during the remainder of his life, but the practical problems were severe. The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys; this method, for example, was used to survey France, and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806. For sea navigation, where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult, the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer, such as that of John Harrison. Late in his life, when totally blind, Galileo designed an <b>escapement</b> mechanism for a pendulum clock (called Galileo's <b>escapement),</b> although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s.|$|E

40|$|The annual runs {{of adult}} salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) to North America and Asia have been {{estimated}} from num-bers {{of fish in}} catches and <b>escapements,</b> or catches and estimated rates of exploitation (Rogers 1987). Russian catches reported in metric tons were converted to num-bers by applying average weights reported in INPFC Sec-retariat (1979). This may result in underestimation of the larger Asian pink and chum salmon runs if competition resulted in smaller body size. Since 1992, Russia has pro-vided salmon <b>escapements</b> from surveys. Russian and Canadian runs for 1992 – 2000 are from North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission documents, and very pre-liminary 2001 statistics are from agencies. Pink salmon <b>escapements</b> in Southeast Alaska have been revised (aerial index increased by 2. 5) to agree with recent ADF&G sta...|$|R

5|$|The Rev. Edward Barlow {{invented the}} rack and snail {{striking}} mechanism for striking clocks, {{which was a}} great improvement over the previous mechanism. The repeating clock, that chimes {{the number of hours}} (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. George Graham invented the deadbeat <b>escapement</b> for clocks in 1720.|$|E
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven <b>escapement</b> mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an <b>escapement</b> mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E
5|$|In his writing, Su Song credited, as the {{predecessor}} of his working clock, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere of Zhang Heng (78–139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist. Su Song was also {{strongly influenced by}} the earlier armillary sphere created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the <b>escapement</b> mechanism and used liquid mercury instead {{of water in the}} waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time). However, Su Song stated in his writing that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.|$|E
50|$|Keen {{to enrich}} its savoir-faire, the L’Epée Manufacture started {{producing}} platform <b>escapements</b> for prestigious alarm clocks and carriage clocks from 1850. This {{was a key}} {{turning point in the}} company's development.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the weight}} of a {{complete}} system, with the iron reed core, output relays, <b>escapements</b> etc., reed systems were more popular for model boats and rarely appeared in model aircraft.|$|R
50|$|As {{new kinds}} of <b>escapements</b> were created which served to better isolate the watch from its time source, the balance spring, watches could be built without a fusee and still be accurate.|$|R
5|$|The Sholes and Glidden {{typewriter}} incorporated several components {{adapted from}} existing devices, such as <b>escapement</b> (a mechanism governing carriage movement) adapted from clockwork, keys adapted from telegraph machines and type hammers {{adapted from the}} piano. In developing the first model, however, Sholes and Soule had not investigated printing machines created by other inventors and, consequently, developed several poor designs {{which could have been}} avoided. The failure to research earlier designs also led to the reinvention of features which had already been developed. Soule, for example, suggested a circular typebar orientation. A circular arrangement had been used more than 30years earlier in a machine designed by Xavier Progin in 1833.|$|E
5|$|What {{were the}} factors {{leading to the}} first <b>escapement</b> clock in China? The chief {{tradition}} leading to Yi Xing (AD 725) was of course the succession of 'pre-clocks' which had started with Zhang Heng about 125. Reason has been given for believing that these applied power to the slow turning movement of computational armillary spheres and celestial globes {{by means of a}} water-wheel using clepsydra drip, which intermittently exerted the force of a lug to act on the teeth of a wheel on a polar-axis shaft. Zhang Heng in his turn had composed this arrangement by uniting the armillary rings of his predecessors into the equatorial armillary sphere, and combining it with the principles of the water-mills and hydraulic trip-hammers which had become so widespread in Chinese culture in the previous century.|$|E
5|$|Technology {{during the}} Tang period was built also upon the {{precedents}} of the past. Advancements in clockworks and timekeeping included the mechanical gear systems of Zhang Heng (78–139) and Ma Jun (fl. 3rd century) gave the Tang engineer, astronomer, and monk Yi Xing (683–727) inspiration when he invented the world's first clockwork <b>escapement</b> mechanism in 725. This was used alongside a clepsydra clock and waterwheel to power a rotating armillary sphere in representation of astronomical observation. Yi Xing's device {{also had a}} mechanically timed bell that was struck automatically every hour, and a drum that was struck automatically every quarter-hour; essentially, a striking clock. Yi Xing's astronomical clock and water-powered armillary sphere became well known throughout the country, since students attempting to pass the imperial examinations by 730 had to write an essay on the device as an exam requirement. However, {{the most common type}} of public and palace timekeeping device was the inflow clepsydra. Its design was improved c. 610 by the Sui-dynasty engineers Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai. They provided a steelyard balance that allowed seasonal adjustment in the pressure head of the compensating tank and could then control the rate of flow for different lengths of day and night.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the verge}} {{is not known}} for accuracy, {{it is capable of}} it. The first {{successful}} marine chronometers, H4 and H5, made by John Harrison in 1759 and 1770, used verge <b>escapements</b> with diamond pallets., In trials they were accurate to within a fifth of a second per day.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{electromechanical}} <b>escapements</b> were developed for pendulum clocks. In these, a switch or phototube energised an electromagnet {{for a brief}} section of the pendulum's swing. On some clocks the pulse of electricity that drove the pendulum also drove a plunger to move the gear train.|$|R
5000|$|The {{assemblies}} {{that control}} movement are also called [...] "mechanisms." [...] Mechanisms are generally classified as gears and gear trains, which includes belt drives and chain drives, {{cam and follower}} mechanisms, and linkages, though there are other special mechanisms such as clamping linkages, indexing mechanisms, <b>escapements</b> and friction devices such as brakes and clutches.|$|R
5|$|The {{historical}} region {{now known}} as China experienced a history involving mechanics, hydraulics and mathematics applied to horology, metallurgy, astronomy, agriculture, engineering, music theory, craftsmanship, naval architecture and warfare. By the Warring States period (403–221 BC), inhabitants of the Warring States had advanced metallurgic technology, including the blast furnace and cupola furnace, while the finery forge and puddling process were known by the Han Dynasty (202 BC–AD 220). A sophisticated economic system in imperial China gave birth to inventions such as paper money during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The invention of gunpowder during the mid 9th century led to an array of inventions such as the fire lance, land mine, naval mine, hand cannon, exploding cannonballs, multistage rocket and rocket bombs with aerodynamic wings and explosive payloads. With the navigational aid of the 11th century compass and ability to steer at high sea with the 1st century sternpost rudder, premodern Chinese sailors sailed as far as East Africa. In water-powered clockworks, the premodern Chinese had used the <b>escapement</b> mechanism since the 8th century and the endless power-transmitting chain drive in the 11th century. They also made large mechanical puppet theaters driven by waterwheels and carriage wheels and wine-serving automatons driven by paddle wheel boats.|$|E
25|$|Another part of {{the patent}} {{concerned}} the escapement—a modification of Arnold's pivoted detent <b>escapement</b> that essentially mounted the detent on a spring. The specification only shows the part of this <b>escapement</b> that is the method of impulse on the impulse roller.|$|E
25|$|Such springs were {{essential}} in modern watches with a detached lever <b>escapement</b> {{because they can}} be adjusted for isochronism. Watches in the time of Huygens and Hooke, however, employed the very undetached verge <b>escapement.</b> It interfered with the isochronal properties of any form of balance spring, spiral or otherwise.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{wrist and}} pocket watches that include the Triple Axis or Tri-Axial Tourbillon <b>escapements.</b> Examples of {{companies}} & watchmakers that include this mechanism are Vianney Halter in his [...] "Deep Space" [...] watch, Thomas Prescher, Aaron Becsei, Girard-Perregaux with the [...] "Tri-Axial Tourbillon" [...] and Jaeger Le-Coultre with the [...] "Gyrotourbillon".|$|R
50|$|Constant Girard devoted many {{long years}} to {{studying}} and designing diverse systems of <b>escapements</b> {{and in particular}} that of the tourbillon. Invented {{at the very beginning}} of the 19th century, the tourbillon counteracted the differing effects of gravity on a watch held in the vertical versus horizontal position, thanks to a mobile cage that carries the settling organ.|$|R
50|$|In 1864 Aaron Dennison and A. O. Bigelow {{set up the}} Tremont Watch Company in Boston. The {{idea was}} that fine parts (such as <b>escapements</b> and wheel trains) would be made in Switzerland (where {{journeyman}} wages were lower than American wages), and the larger parts (such as barrels plates) and assembling would be done in America.|$|R
25|$|In 1782, Arnold {{took out}} another patent {{to protect the}} latest and most {{important}} inventions, which were potentially lucrative. Several other watchmakers, most notably Thomas Earnshaw, had started to copy Arnold's work. Around 1780, Earnshaw modifyied his detent <b>escapement</b> by mounting the detent on a spring to create the spring detent <b>escapement.</b>|$|E
25|$|Two other makers {{also made}} {{precision}} watches with the detached escapement: Josiah Emery and John Brockbank. Both were friends of Arnold, and both employed the highly skilled workman and <b>escapement</b> maker Thomas Earnshaw. Josiah Emery used, with Arnold's permission, an earlier form of his compensation balance and helical balance spring, {{in conjunction with}} the detached lever <b>escapement</b> of Thomas Mudge. John Brockbank employed Earnshaw to make his pattern of chronometer, but with Brockbank's design of compensation balance.|$|E
25|$|Pendulums (unlike, for example, quartz crystals) have a {{low enough}} Q that the {{disturbance}} caused by the impulses to keep them moving is generally the limiting factor on their timekeeping accuracy. Therefore, {{the design of the}} <b>escapement,</b> the mechanism that provides these impulses, has a large effect on the accuracy of a clock pendulum. If the impulses given to the pendulum by the <b>escapement</b> each swing could be exactly identical, the response of the pendulum would be identical, and its period would be constant. However, this is not achievable; unavoidable random fluctuations in the force due to friction of the clock's pallets, lubrication variations, and changes in the torque provided by the clock's power source as it runs down, mean that the force of the impulse applied by the <b>escapement</b> varies.|$|E
50|$|Kochański cooperated and {{corresponded with}} many scientists, Johannes Hevelius and Gottfried Leibniz among them. He was {{apparently}} {{the only one}} of the contemporary Poles to know elements of the newly invented calculus. As a mechanic he was a renowned clock maker. He suggested replacing the clock's pendulum with a spring, and standardizing the number of <b>escapements</b> per hour.|$|R
50|$|By the 11th century, {{clockwork}} {{was used}} for both timepieces and to track astronomical events, in Europe. The clocks did not keep time very accurately by modern standards, but the astronomical devices were carefully used to predict the positions of planets and other movement. The same timeline seems to apply in Europe, where mechanical <b>escapements</b> were used in clocks by that time.|$|R
50|$|Fourth wheel - In clocks {{and watches}} {{with the second}} hand in a subdial on the face, this turns once per minute, and the shaft {{projects}} through the face and holds the second hand. The fourth wheel also turns the escape wheel pinion. Many clocks don't need this wheel, because of their slower moving <b>escapements,</b> and in these the third wheel drives the escape wheel directly.|$|R
