If the child is not intelligent enough, the wife asks them. If the wife does not ask the questions, the leader of the seder asks them. And even two scholars who know the laws of Passover must ask one another (if no one else can ask).|$|E
25|$|Perhaps Diaghilev's {{most notable}} composer-collaborator, however, was Igor Stravinsky. Diaghilev heard Stravinsky's early orchestral works Fireworks and Scherzo fantastique, and was {{impressed}} <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> Stravinsky to arrange some pieces by Chopin for the Ballets Russes. In 1910, he commissioned his first score from Stravinsky, The Firebird. Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913) followed shortly afterwards, {{and the two}} also worked together on Les noces (1923) and Pulcinella (1920) together with Picasso, who designed the costumes and the set.|$|E

500|$|The album also {{included}} [...] "Dio", a song written {{as a tribute}} to rock singer Ronnie James Dio, which mocked him somewhat for being too old. Dio liked the song <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the band to appear in the music video for his song, [...] "Push". An EP entitled D Fun Pak was released in 2002. It featured a skit and acoustic versions of [...] "Jesus Ranch" [...] and [...] "Kyle Quit The Band", as well as a megamix by Mocean Worker. The Complete Masterworks, a music DVD featuring the entire run of their TV series, music videos, and a live performance from London's Brixton Academy recorded in 2002, was released on November 9, 2003.|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal is {{politically}} active. At the 18th Independent Spirit Awards, she {{spoke out against}} the Iraq war, stating {{the reason for the}} invasion was [...] "oil and imperialism". In 2005, Gyllenhaal drew controversy for her statement that the September 11 attacks were [...] "an occasion to be brave <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> some serious questions about America's role in the world ... It is always useful as individuals or nations to ask how we may have knowingly or unknowingly contributed to this conflict." [...] Gyllenhaal took part in Artists United to Win Without War, a campaign started by Robert Greenwald that aimed to advance progressive causes and voicing opposition to the Iraq War. She and her brother Jake filmed a commercial for Rock the Vote, and visited the University of Southern California (USC) campus to encourage students to vote in the 2004 U.S. presidential election, in which she supported John Kerry. Gyllenhaal supported Barack Obama in the 2008 presidential election. She has campaigned on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), an organization her family strongly supports.|$|E
500|$|Outliers has two parts: [...] "Part One: Opportunity" [...] {{contains}} five chapters, and [...] "Part Two: Legacy" [...] has four. The {{book also}} contains an Introduction and Epilogue. Focusing on outliers, defined by Gladwell {{as people who}} do not fit into our normal understanding of achievement, Outliers deals with exceptional people, especially those who are smart, rich, and successful, and those who operate at the extreme outer edge of what is statistically plausible. The book offers examples that include the musical ensemble The Beatles, Microsoft's co-founder Bill Gates, and the theoretical physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer. In the introduction, Gladwell lays out the purpose of Outliers: [...] "It's not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> what successful people are like. [...] It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't." [...] Throughout the publication, he discusses how family, culture, and friendship each play a role in an individual's success, and he constantly asks whether successful people deserve the praise that we give them.|$|E

500|$|Several {{critics have}} {{positively}} reviewed the song [...] "Gitchee Gitchee Goo" [...] from the episode, stating that it [...] "could probably have gotten radio play 20 years ago." [...] Disney as well enjoyed it <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> the creators to write songs every episode. The song has since then made brief appearances in later episodes, either in [...] "elevator music" [...] form {{or as the}} song itself. The song was featured as an extended version on the album Disney Channel Playlist, which featured multiple songs from different Disney Channel artists. The song also {{was one of the}} twenty-six songs appearing on the series official soundtrack, released on September 29, 2009. The episode was one of several that was featured on the first volume DVD of season one titled [...] "The Fast and the Phineas." [...] In the DVD, it is paired with its production partner [...] "Are You My Mummy?" [...] Lara Bergen adapted the episode, along with the fellow season one episode [...] "Lights, Candace, Action!" [...] into a novella for young readers titled Runaway Hit. It was the second of a series of novelizations made from the series.|$|E
2500|$|At age eight, {{he started}} piano lessons. He was an {{economics}} major at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, where he graduated cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa in 1933. During his college days, Weston {{had his own}} band called [...] "the Green Serenaders"; this allowed him to pay his own college tuition. Weston also learned {{how to play the}} clarinet so he could travel with the college band. He went to graduate school at Columbia University and was active in the Blue Lions, Columbia's dance band. In January 1934, Weston was seriously injured in a train accident. While trying to catch a train, Weston grabbed a door handle as the train sped off. [...] He was able {{to hold on to the}} handle and was dragged two and one half miles before losing his grip. Unable to be active in a band, he started doing music arranging as a way to keep some involvement with music while convalescing. When he returned to New York in the fall of 1934, he made his first sale of his work to Joe Haymes. Haymes liked Weston's work <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him to do more arrangements for his band. His medley of Anything Goes songs was heard by Rudy Vallee, who contacted him and offered Weston a job as an arranger for his Fleischmann's Hour on radio. Weston was also doing arranging for Phil Harris.|$|E
2500|$|After {{his work}} with the {{homeless}} community in New York City and Philadelphia, Wodiczko returned to the possibilities of smaller, personal instruments as conceptual and functional objects to offset the problems of communication for urban migrants. Initially based on the iconic staff of the wandering prophet, the Alien Staff (1992 and its variant, 1992/93) was designed to mediate conversation between aliens (the juridical term designating all immigrants whether of legal or illegal status) and the franchised population of an urban environment. [...] The staff not only presented an object of curiosity to passersby, causing them to interrupt their pace long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> questions, it also became a repository of narrative recording and objects both sacred or necessary (e.g., green cards or family mementoes) {{to the lives of}} the immigrants. Influenced by Julia Kristeva’s Strangers to Ourselves (1991), Wodiczko developed new equipment in 1993 that focused even more directly on democratic speech rights for the performative stranger. Mouthpiece (Porte-parole) was intended to act as a protective zone so that the immigrant could expand her narrative outward into a collective experience thereby pulling her out of isolation. [...] The video technology, to be worn over the mouth, makes strange the familiar thereby creating a point of entry for passersby to enter into conversation with the immigrant. Between 1993 and 1997, thirteen culturally displaced persons used variants of the Mouthpiece in Paris, Malmö, Helsinki, Warsaw, Amsterdam, Trélazé, and Angers.|$|E
