40|$|Abstract: Tea <b>garden</b> <b>tiller</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used in China, which is {{indispensable}} equipment for soil tilling in tea garden. The performance of tea <b>garden</b> <b>tiller</b> is always focused on when being used. Meanwhile, researches on evaluating the performance of tea <b>garden</b> <b>tiller</b> have been rarely reported. So it is of importance to find a methodology to evaluate tiller’s performance. In this paper, the important indexes of tiller performances are presented firstly, including fuel consumption, cultivation time, cultivation depth, cultivation width and soil crushing ratio. Then these indexes for eight different types of cultivation machineries from home and abroad are experimented and detected. Thirdly, rough sets and radar chart are utilized for performance evaluation of cultivation machineries, where rough set theory is to determine the weight of performance index and radar chart for performance analysis. Finally, performance of cultivation machinery is analyzed based on radar chart, which can provide the convenience and proof of optimal cultivation machinery selection for farmers. The results of radar chart analysis show that operational performance of KAMA B is the best and Little White Dragon B stand the second place. In addition, from the performance analysis, the deficiencies of service cultivation machinery can be found and the improvements can be suggested...|$|E

50|$|Magna American a {{division}} of Magna Corporation of Flowood, MS, was a manufacturer of tractors, lawn mowers, <b>garden</b> <b>tillers,</b> and specialized products including the Amphicat and the Magna Duck Plucker. The company was based in Ohio, then moved to Raymond, Mississippi in the late 1960s. The company ceased operations in the 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Magna Corporation was a {{publicly}} held company in Flowood, Mississippi, U.S.A. {{that served as}} a holding company. Its primary divisions were Mississippi Steel and Magna American. Mississippi Steel was Mississippi's first steel manufacturer beginning operations in 1957. Magna American built <b>garden</b> <b>tillers</b> and other items, as well as manufacturing the Amphicat in Raymond, Mississippi.|$|R
5000|$|Mini tiller: Mini tillers are a {{new type}} of small {{agricultural}} tillers or cultivators used by farmers or homeowners. These are also known as power <b>tillers</b> or <b>garden</b> <b>tillers.</b> Compact, powerful and, most importantly, inexpensive, these agricultural rotary tillers are providing alternatives to four-wheel tractors and in the small farmers' fields in developing countries are more economical than four-wheel tractors.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{equipment}} such as pressure washers, {{lawn and}} <b>garden</b> tractors, <b>tillers,</b> generators and water pumps use V-twin engines when that equipment {{is large enough to}} need more power, usually in excess of 16 horsepower, than can be provided by a single-cylinder engine. These V-twin engines have horizontal or vertical crankshafts, usually have 90-degree cylinder angles, and are usually forced-air-cooled. The V-twin configuration gives these engines a smaller footprint and less vibration, in the absence of balancing shafts, than other two-cylinder configurations.|$|R
50|$|The {{engines are}} {{commonly}} used on pressure washers. They {{can also be used}} on construction equipment such as soil compactors, generators and air compressors, and various lawn and <b>garden</b> equipment including <b>tillers,</b> edgers, reel mowers and blower/vacs. The engines have also found to work well on go-karts.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{southern}} terminus {{options were}} put forward, at Cubitt Town (today's Island <b>Gardens</b> station) and <b>Tiller</b> Road, {{on the west}} side of Millwall Dock, with two possible routes to reach them. A [...] "western" [...] route would have run from the Westferry station alongside West Ferry Road via Cuba Street, then either terminating at Tiller Road or continuing over Millwall Docks Cut to a terminus at Cubitt Town. The [...] "central" [...] option required the West India Docks to be infilled or bridged and would run down the middle of the peninsula, through what was at the time an area of derelict warehouses. Ultimately this latter option was chosen, though the 1981 London Transport report warned that without extensive development around Canary Wharf the area would be [...] "very isolated with poor traffic prospects"– as indeed it was, for a number of years.|$|R
