They have released tracks by and toured with post-rock band Tortoise, while John McEntire of Tortoise <b>has</b> <b>in</b> turn worked on several Stereolab albums. In the 1990s Stereolab and veteran industrial band Nurse With Wound released two limited-edition records together; both contained Nurse With Wound remixes of original tracks provided by Stereolab.|$|E

5000|$|One of Heroldrebe's {{drawbacks}} is {{its relatively}} late ripening; it is harvested {{at about the}} same time as Pinot noir. Heroldrebe was grown on a total of 155 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Germany in 2008, with a decreasing trend. There were 99 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Palatinate, 32 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Rheinhessen, and 23 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> Württemberg. In Palatinate it is typically used to produce light, almost pinkish, colored wines.|$|R
5|$|Another habit {{the moth}} <b>has</b> <b>in</b> common with many {{butterflies}} {{is the night}} resting posture—the wings are held vertically over the back. During their migrations they roost in a group for the night. The moth flies over the crown of trees and in clearings. Sometimes because of high winds it is carried about 100m (300ft), it then falls, inert and wings closed, to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Basingstoke is {{situated}} {{on a bed}} of cretaceous upper chalk with small areas of clayey and loamy soil, inset with combined clay and flint patches. Loam and alluvium recent and pleistocene sediments line the bed of the river Loddon. A narrow line of tertiary Reading beds run diagonally from the northwest to the southeast along a line from Sherborne St John throughPopley, Daneshill and the north part of Basing. To the north of this line, encompassing the areas of Chineham and Pyotts Hill, is London clay, which <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past allowed excavation for high quality brick and tile manufacture.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing remains highly {{controversial}} {{with the public}} {{both before and after}} implementation. This <b>has</b> <b>in</b> part been resolved through referendums, such as after the seven-month trial period in Stockholm; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go, since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax, while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area. In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border (where the votes counted), but not outside.|$|E

5|$|Famitsu writers {{appreciated}} {{the amount of}} freedom the player <b>has.</b> <b>In</b> their reviews of the PlayStation and the Game Boy Advance versions, {{they said that the}} gameplay still holds up.

5|$|In {{countries}} of the former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries, a team <b>has</b> <b>in</b> the past been chosen several years beforehand, and they are given special training specifically for the event.

Total cultivated land reached 49000 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 1989 but dropped dramatically between 2000 and 2003 to 500 <b>ha.</b> <b>In</b> 2003 several companies realized the potential growth of this crop in Romania and the cultivated surface started to rise from year to year to 1200 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2004 to 5600 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2006 and to 12900 <b>ha</b> <b>in</b> 2009.|$|R
