25|$|Belmont had {{disdain for}} the nouveau riche who, in splashy {{displays}} of wealth, built ostentatious mansions between Bellevue Avenue and the Atlantic coast. As a result, guests entered Belcourt through an entrance on Ledge Road, a short road which runs parallel to Bellevue Avenue. This entrance is a few feet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> and the effect was that the back of Belcourt was turned to the nouveau riche on Bellevue Avenue.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>curb</b> bit places {{pressure}} on the bars, the palate (especially if the port of <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> bit is fairly large), and via <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> chain, <b>the</b> poll and chin groove. It is used to regulate vertical flexion (cresting the neck and collecting the body through an arched spine), and the poll pressure asks the horse to lower the poll and telescope the neck to raise {{the base of the}} neck. If the horse tries to push his nose outward without permission <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rider, <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> reins will automatically come into play and tighten, asking the horse to flex. If the horse stiffens, adding slight poll and tongue pressure with <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> can ask him to relax at the poll.|$|R
60|$|Honora {{looked around}} her. Stafford Park {{consisted}} of a wide centre-way of red gravel, not yet packed, with an island in its middle planted with shrubbery and young trees, the bare branches of which formed a black tracery against the orange-red of the western sky. On {{both sides of this}} centre-way were concrete walks, with cross-walks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curbs</b> to <b>the</b> houses. There were six of these--three on each side--standing on a raised terrace and about two hundred feet apart. Beyond them, to the northward, Stafford Park was still a wilderness of second-growth hardwood, interspersed with a few cedars.|$|R
25|$|The raised ranch is {{a two-story}} house, {{in which a}} {{finished}} basement serves as an additional floor. It may be built into a hill to some degree, such that the full size {{of the house is}} not evident <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> However, it does not become a raised ranch simply by having two floors. For it to be a raised ranch, you will have to climb a flight of steps to get to the main living floor - if not it is just a bi-level house. Among real estate agents, this term is commonly misused.|$|E
500|$|Nixon was {{initially}} {{convinced that the}} speech was a failure. Despite the congratulations of Rogers and Chotiner, {{and the fact that}} one of the cameramen had tears running down his face, he reproved himself for not mentioning the address of the Republican National Committee. Though the Young Republicans continued their applause as the Nixon party left the theatre, the candidate fixed on an Irish Setter running alongside his car as it pulled away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> [...] "Well, we made a hit in the dog world anyway." [...] Despite the senator's despair, his wife was convinced that her husband had vindicated himself. Over sixty million Americans had watched or listened to the speech, including the largest television audience up to that point.|$|E
2500|$|On December 19, 2010, 504 King {{streetcar}} service {{returned to}} Roncesvalles Avenue after {{the street was}} rebuilt to a new design which provided a widened sidewalk [...] "bumpout" [...] at each stop to allow riders to board a streetcar directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> When no streetcar is present, cyclists may ride over the bumpout as it is doubles {{as part of a}} bike lane.|$|E

2500|$|Passengers walked {{as little}} as [...] going <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> to the gate. Once there, {{passengers}} would be transported to their aircraft by Passenger Transfer Vehicles (PTVs), rather than walking through jetways. The PTVs, similar to those at Washington Dulles International Airport, ran from the terminal to the aircraft parking spot on the ramp. It was reported by Radio-Canada/Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{that each of these}} vehicles had cost up to C$ 400,000 at the time. To eventually make connections between flights easier, the terminal also included a few jetways, in a smaller concourse called the Aeroquay, accessible via an underground tunnel and later connected directly to the main concourse.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, US {{curbside}} mailboxes {{are classified}} as (T) Traditional, (C) Contemporary, or (L) Locking. Traditional or Contemporary non-locking curbside mailboxes are approved in three sizes - No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, measured by minimum interior dimensions. The largest acceptable curbside mailbox is the No. 3, which measures 22.81inches long, 11inches wide, and 15inches in height (58cm x 28cm x 38cm) at the peak. Locking mailbox designs that provide security for the recipient's incoming mail have fewer restrictions on shape and size, though designs with a slot for incoming mail {{must be at least}} 1.75inches high by 10inches wide. Residential locking mailboxes cannot require the postal carrier to have a key, by USPS Specifications. [...] Therefore, no USPS approved residential locking mailbox has secure outgoing mail. Installation requirements vary from standard unlocked mailboxes: with locking mailboxes, the incoming mail slot must be 41"-45" [...] above the roadside surface, and the front of the mailbox must be 6"-8" [...] back <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> [...] USPS specifications for all mailboxes mandate the same, except the placement of the 'incoming mail area' varies with a locking mailbox.|$|E

5000|$|Play {{consists}} of the pitcher throwing {{the ball to the}} catcher, while a batter attempts to hit the ball, as in baseball. Some half-rubber regulations call for the pitcher to stand 50 or 60 feet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> batter. When halfball is played in a city street, the batter typically stands at one <b>curb</b> and <b>the</b> pitcher throws across <b>the</b> street <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opposite <b>curb,</b> unlike stickball which is played [...] "down the street." ...|$|R
25|$|One of the tributaries of the River Adur weaves its {{way through}} the town, known locally as Hambrook.

5000|$|The {{market was}} {{originally}} established in 1918 on land cleared by the Great Atlanta fire of 1917. The market, {{set up in}} a huge tent, was an immediate success, bringing urban consumers direct access to farmers and their products. Wishing to give <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> market a more permanent home, the Atlanta Woman's Club raised money for a fireproof brick and concrete building which opened on May 1, 1924, and was called the Municipal Market of Atlanta. At the time, it was located in the exact geographic center of Atlanta and quickly became [...] "the place to shop" [...] for every Atlantan. At that time, Atlanta was still living under racial segregation and whites shopped inside the market while blacks were only permitted to shop <b>from</b> stalls lining <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> <b>The</b> market's current name reflects that era.|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”A {{real-time}} algorithm for curb detection {{in traffic}} scenes, based on dense stereovision, is proposed. Curbs are modeled as cubic polynomial curves. 3 D points from stereovision are {{transformed into a}} Digital Elevation Map (DEM), {{in order to have}} a compact representation of the 3 D space. Curb points are detected as the cells of the DEM that present a specific height variation. Only curb points that are temporally persistent and non-occluded are considered. Relevant cubic polynomials are computed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> set of <b>curb</b> points by a RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) approach. For each relevant polynomial, <b>the</b> <b>curb</b> patch is extracted by analyzing the DEM along the polynomial curve. Finally, the vertical location and height of each curb are computed based on the local elevation data. I...|$|R

60|$|He {{had just}} put {{down at the}} Apollo and had crossed over to the left, going down toward Piccadilly, when the two swells hailed him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> He couldn't rightly see them, because of the fog, but he noticed that both wore high hats and the collars of their {{overcoats}} ware turned up to their ears.

60|$|And so, amid {{shouting}} and cheering, our fate was decided, and I found myself borne {{away in the}} human current which swirled towards the door, with my mind half stunned by the vast new project which had risen so suddenly before it. As I emerged from the hall I was conscious {{for a moment of}} a rush of laughing students--down the pavement, and of an arm wielding a heavy umbrella, which rose and fell in the midst of them. Then, amid a mixture of groans and cheers, Professor Challenger's electric brougham slid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb,</b> and I found myself walking under the silvery lights of Regent Street, full of thoughts of Gladys and of wonder as to my future.|$|E
60|$|He {{would go}} to her now. She would tell him what to do; and after dinner, when the dear lady was {{thinking}} of early bedtime, he might slip away with Isabel Doan's check. He must return it in person. He shifted {{from one foot to}} the other and beat his arms across his breast. The charge of the blizzard was paralyzing. Down the way a car was coming--a red one, he was sure of it--glad of it. His mother would be waiting for him. For the time he forgot a parallel track and that other destination directly west. Suddenly like songs of sirens, he heard the buzz of opposing trolleys. Two cars would meet before his eyes! But the red one still led. Yet how strange: it had just stopped. The yellow opponent came on. The priest breathed hard. Fate seemed to be thrashing his will with the storm. Again the red car moved and the yellow one halted. Chance was playing a game. He leaned expectant <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>curb.</b> Something had gone wrong, for once more the red line had lost the trolley, then an instant later a yellow car stood on the crossing. Father Barry sprang over the tracks, veered around to an open side, jumped aboard.|$|E
5000|$|Preliminary {{studies and}} {{community}} outreach began in 2011, with around 25 community meetings taking place.

50|$|It is not {{required}} to wear a helmet unless the rider is under the age of 18 years. A driver's license is also {{not required}} for a cyclist.

This explicit provision, combined with the California Driver's Handbook (which indicates that passing vehicles must ensure 3 ft minimum safe passing distance), means that certain lanes which are not wide enough for a bicycle and a passing automobile should be occupied by the bicycle until it is safe for the cyclist to pull in to the right and signal the automobile to overtake if there is no other safe-passing lane available for the automobile.|$|R
