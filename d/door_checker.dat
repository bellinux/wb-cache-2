50|$|St. Augustine's High School and Gandhi Memorial Upper {{primary school}} {{are the main}} {{educational}} institutions in Nellikutty. It was founded in 1964 by the Parish of Nellikutty as a fulfillment of the wish of the migrant fathers. The school was managed by the parish of Nellikutty.But later the Diocese started a Corporate Educational Agency and the school {{became a part of}} it. There is a network of government schools, corporate schools and CBSE schools in and around Nellikutty.The main thing is that school won most of the prizes from different competitions. Now management bought a school bus and its driver is Saju thalamplackal and <b>door</b> <b>checker</b> is googly.|$|E

And, from the estimated <b>door</b> <b>checker</b> arm resistance force and theoretically calculated self-closing force, door effort was predicted. The analysis results at checker arm peaks showed excellent correlation with the test results. Also, in order to reduce solving time, a modified model with simple spring element was investigated. Finally an equation to easily calculate checker arm resistance force from checker arm shape and spring constant was suggested and its usefulness in early design stage was discussed...|$|E
50|$|Opting {{for a more}} aggressive, stripped-down {{sound and}} a more {{experimental}} approach to the songwriting, Salas-Humara returned to New York and refashioned the Silos as a power trio with Drew Glackin on bass and lap steel guitar and Konrad Meissner on drums. This configuration appeared on Laser Beam Next <b>Door</b> (2001, <b>Checkered</b> Past), When the Telephone Rings (2004, Dualtone), Come on Like the Fast Lane (2007, Bloodshot) and the live This Highway Is a Circle that same year (Blue Rose). After Glackinâ€™s unexpected death in 2008, Salas-Humara and Meissner added Jason Victor on guitar, Rod Hohl on bass, and Bruce Martin on keyboard, and recorded the 2011 Silos record Florizona (Sonic Pyramid).|$|R
