40|$|A {{rare case}} of the {{testicular}} artery is reported for a 59 -year-old Japanese male cadaver. On the left side, two testicular arteries were found. One arose from the aorta caudal to the left renal artery. The other branched from the left <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery</b> which arose from the left renal artery. On the right side, the right testicular artery branched from the right <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery</b> which arose from the right renal artery. On both sides, the testicular arteries from the renal artery supplied the perirenal fat and then passed vertically caudalwards to reach the deep inguinal ring. The morphological significance of the relations between this case and the vascular supply of the perirenal fat is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Testicular arteries {{arise from}} the {{abdominal}} aorta and the <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery</b> from the renal artery. There are reports about variant origin and course of these arteries. Accessory testicular artery is also a common finding but its providing origin to <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery</b> is an important observation. During a routine dissection of abdomen of approximately 55 -year-old male cadaver, unique vascular abnormality was observed. On the left side, a common arterial trunk originating from abdominal aorta immediately branched to give rise to superior testicular and inferior suprarenal arteries, the former after a short course hooked by the left suprarenal vein. In addition, the left suprarenal vein, second left lumbar vein, and left testicular vein joined to form a common trunk which drained into the left renal vein. A sound knowledge of vascular variations {{in relation to the}} kidney and suprarenal gland is important to surgeons dissecting the abdominal cavity...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Suprarenal gland is {{normally}} supplied by superior, middle and <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>arteries</b> {{which are the}} branches of inferior phrenic, abdominal aorta and renal artery respectively. However the arterial supply of the suprarenal gland may show variations. Therefore a {{study was conducted to}} find the variations in the arterial supply of Suprarenal Gland.

40|$|The angioarchitecture of the coeliac {{sympathetic}} ganglion complex (CGC) of {{the common}} tree shrew (Tupaia glis) was studied by the vascular corrosion cast technique in conjunction with scanning electron microscopy. The CGC of the tree shrew {{was found to be}} a highly vascularised organ. It normally received arterial blood supply from branches of the <b>inferior</b> phrenic, superior <b>suprarenal</b> and <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>arteries</b> and of the abdominal aorta. In some animals, its blood supply was also derived from branches of the middle <b>suprarenal</b> <b>arteries,</b> coeliac artery, superior mesenteric artery and lumbar arteries. These arteries penetrated the ganglion at variable points and in slightly different patterns. They gave off peripheral branches to form a subcapsular capillary plexus while their main trunks traversed deeply into the inner part before branching into the densely packed intraganglionic capillary networks. The capillaries merged to form venules before draining into collecting veins at the peripheral region of the ganglion complex. Finally, the veins coursed to the dorsal aspect of the ganglion to drain into the renal and inferior phrenic veins and the inferior vena cava. The capillaries on the coeliac ganglion complex do not possess fenestrations...|$|R
40|$|A {{vascular}} anomaly {{found during}} the dissection {{of a human}} cadaver {{appears to be a}} unique anatomical variant. A search of the literature has not revealed a similar instance. DESCRIPTION The subject was a white male who died of sixty-six years of age. a cerebral hemorrhage at The right internal spermatic artery, instead of having its origin from the aorta at the normal level, arose above that of the renal artery. It passed caudally between the right renal artery and the renal vein; from this point on, it had a normal descent to the testis. An anomalous vascular connection {{in the form of an}} artery 3 mm. in diameter, serving as the <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery,</b> arose from the internal spermatic artery immediately caudal to the renal vein. It passed anteriorly to the latter in its course to the suprarenal gland (Fig. 1). The right kidney was normal both in appearance and position. DISCUSSION In embryonic development, the vessels which will ultimately become the renal, suprarenal, and internal spermatic arteries are connected by many branches which constitute part of the periaortic plexus. It is possible that any of the connecting branches of the periaortic plexus may persist. ' The present suprarenal artery arising from the internal spermatic was probably a connecting artery which persisted to become the inferior suprarenal. Such an origin of the <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery</b> is not unusual'; however, it is uncommon to find the internal spermatic and the inferior suprarenal arteries forming such an intimate loop around the renal vein. It is plausible to consider that in severe nephroptosis such an arterial loop could produce obstruction of the renal vein...|$|E
40|$|A 52 -year-old man {{was hospitalized}} for a right adrenal tumor {{which had been}} {{incidentally}} found by abdominal CT scan for examination of colon cancer. Laboratory and endocrine findings were within the normal limits except for increased urinary concentrations of noradrenaline and dopamine. Adrenal angiography revealed that the feeding artery of the tumor was the <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery.</b> Adrenal venous blood sampling studies detected no abnormalities in the concentrations of catecholamine, cortisol or aldosterone. Right adrenalectomy was performed and the tumor was histologically diagnosed as ganglioneuroma. Ganglioneuroma is a benign tumor originating from the sympathetic nerve ganglion. The adrenal origin of the tumor is relatively rare and 60 cases of adrenal ganglioneuroma including our case {{have been reported in}} Japan...|$|E
40|$|Variations {{of vessels}} in {{abdominal}} area are quite common. This case report illustrated a unique case of combined variations of bilateral renal arteries, right testicular and right inferior suprarenal arteries. During a routine dissection {{of a male}} cadaver, we found bilateral inferior accessory renal arteries. Both arose from abdominal aorta and entered the kidneys exactly at the lower pole. Moreover, right testicular artery did not directly originate from abdominal aorta. It formed common trunk with right <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery.</b> This common trunk arose from right main renal artery, while left testicular artery originated from abdominal aorta as usual. To best of our knowledge, the variation we discovered in an individual has not been issued in the literature before. Interestingly, variation such as in this case {{should be kept in}} mind due to its clinical and surgical significance...|$|E
30|$|The adrenals are paired retroperitoneal glands {{that lie}} superiorly and anteromedially to the kidneys. They are triangular-shaped {{with the right}} adrenal gland being usually more {{pyramidal}} in shape [8]. The adrenal glands are made of an outer cortex deriving from the mesoderm and an inner medulla deriving from the neural crest. In the cortex, the zona glomerulosa produces mineralocorticoids, the zona fasciculata glucocorticoids, and the zona reticularis sex steroids or gonadocorticoids, whereas the medulla produces catecholamines, adrenaline, and noradrenaline. The adrenals are supplied by three arteries: superior (from the inferior phrenic arteries), middle (from the abdominal aorta), and <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>arteries</b> (from the renal arteries). The right adrenal vein ends into the inferior vena cava, while the left adrenal vein ends into the left renal vein or inferior phrenic vein. The lymphatic vessels drain to the para-aortic nodes. The innervation of adrenals comes from the splanchnic nerves arising from the aortic and renal plexuses [9].|$|R

40|$|In general, {{testicular}} artery (TA) usually {{arises from the}} antero-lateral part of the abdominal aorta below {{the origin of the}} renal arteries at second lumbar vertebrae level. Very rarely variations in the origin of the testicular arteries are observed. We here report a rare case of bilateral unusual origin and course of the {{testicular artery}}. On the right side, testicular artery aroused from the aorta about 0. 5 cm above the origin of the renal artery and gave off <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery.</b> In contrast, left testicular artery springs from the pre-hilar branch of the left renal artery, 2 cm before reaching the hilum of kidney. On both sides, testicular arteries descended in front of the hilar structures of the kidney. Since, the origin and course of the testicular artery is important to consider during surgical and diagnostic interventions, knowledge of such variation may be helpful in avoiding diagnostic and surgical errors and adverse consequences especially during laparoscopic approaches...|$|E
40|$|In a Japanese female cadaver, {{the left}} ovarian artery {{originated}} from the abdominal aorta {{superior to the}} level of the renal vessels. Accompanied by 2 veins, it coursed laterally to the upper pole of the left kidney, then inferiorly along its posterolateral aspect. Two vessels branched from it; the first went to the left suprarenal gland as a substitute for the missing left <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery,</b> whereas the second supplied the diaphragm as a supernumerary inferior phrenic artery. The venae comitantes drained into the left renal vein. Associated unusual findings were (1) external lobation of the left kidney, (2) supernumerary left renal artery, and (3) the uterine artery being the main arterial supply to the left ovary. The aberrant course of the ovarian artery may have resulted from an abnormal descent of the left ovary under the influence of a wandering gubernaculum during development. Our report also points to the potential for an ectopic artery, i. e. the ovarian to be located in a place other than its definite pelvic position...|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} surgical {{methods were}} used to create experimental models of aneurysms in rats. The first model was an autogeneous side-to-side anastomosis of the inferior vena cava to the abdominal aorta. This model proved to be ac-ceptable for acute preparations but was not amenable to survival surgery since occlusion of the venous circulation occurred. The second model developed was a renal vein aneurysm that was created in either of two ways: (1) the left renal vein was ligated at its juncture with the inferior vena cava and a partial ne-phrectomy performed, or (2) the left renal vein was ligated in the same manner, {{as well as the}} <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery.</b> With either technique, the aneurysm developed within five to ten minutes. This model was technically satisfactory but also occluded the venous circulation as the first method had. The third model developed was a heterogeneous aorta of a donor animal grafted to the abdominal aorta of a recipient animal. This model proved to be best for survival surgery and gave patent aneurysms up to one week following surgery...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Although {{variations}} in {{the origin of the}} testicular artery are not uncommon, few reports about a high origin from the abdominal aorta exist in the literature. We discuss the case of a high origin of the testicular artery, its embryology, classification systems, and its clinical significance. Case presentation We report a very rare case of high origin of the left testicular artery in a 68 -year-old Caucasian male cadaver. The artery originated from the anterolateral aspect of the abdominal aorta, 2 cm cranially to the ipsilateral renal artery. Approximately 1 cm after its origin, it branched off into the <b>inferior</b> <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery.</b> During its course, the artery crossed anterior to the left renal artery. Conclusions A knowledge of the variant origin of the testicular artery is important during renal and testicular surgery. The origin and course must be carefully identified in order to preserve normal blood circulation and prevent testicular atrophy. A reduction in gonadal blood flow may lead to varicocele under circumstances. A knowledge of this variant anatomy may be of interest to radiologists and helpful in avoiding diagnostic errors. </p...|$|E

50|$|The {{abdominal}} aorta {{gives rise to}} lumbar and musculophrenic arteries, renal and middle <b>suprarenal</b> <b>arteries,</b> and visceral arteries (the celiac trunk, the superior mesenteric artery and the inferior mesenteric artery). It ends in a bifurcation into {{the left and right}} common iliac arteries. At the point of the bifurcation, there also springs a smaller branch, the median sacral artery.|$|R
50|$|The first lumbar {{vertebra}} is {{level with the}} anterior end of the ninth rib. This level is also called the important transpyloric plane, since the pylorus of the stomach is at this level.

40|$|Multiple {{variations}} {{were found}} in a 54 -year-old male cadaver during routine dissections of abdominal retroperitoneal region. Right inferior phrenic artery was arising from right renal artery, while the right middle and superior <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery</b> branched from the right inferior phrenic artery. Left inferior phrenic artery was originating from the abdominal aorta below celiac trunk. The left middle <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery</b> appeared as the branch of celiac trunk. Double left renal artery was arising separately {{from the left side}} of the aorta. The upper left renal artery showed approximately 80 º of kinking which then crossed the lower one and entered to the inferior pole of hilum of kidney. Left testicular artery was originating from the upper left renal artery after this kinking. The left and right fourth lumbar arteries and median sacral artery have branched from a common trunk posterior to the abdominal aorta. In spite of these abundant variations in the branches, abdominal aorta itself did not show any variation, spanning normally between the levels of T 12 –L 4 vertebrae.

40|$|The {{variations}} of the arteries that develop from the mesonephric arteries, including renal, gonadal and <b>suprarenal</b> <b>arteries</b> are common. Variations in the anatomical relationship of the gonadal arteries to the renal vessels are frequently reported. We here present a case of an unusual origin and course of a left testicular artery arching over left renal vein. The arching of the left testicular artery over the left renal vein could be a possible cause of the left renal vein compression. Therefore, knowledge of the possible existence of arching gonadal vessels {{in relation to the}} renal vein could be of paramount importance to vascular surgeons and urologists during surgery in the retroperitoneal region...|$|R
40|$|Separate {{genes for}} alpha-i A and alpha-i B adrenoceptors {{have now been}} identified.

40|$|Knowledge of {{variations}} {{of blood vessels}} of the abdomen is important during operative, diagnostic and endovascular pro- cedures. During routine dissection of the abdominal cavity, we came across multiple vascular anomalies involving renal, <b>suprarenal</b> and testicular <b>arteries.</b> The left kidney was supplied by two renal arteries originating together from the abdomi- nal aorta, and the right kidney was supplied by two accessory renal arteries, {{one of which was}} arising from the right renal artery and the other one from the aorta (about 2 inches below the origin of the renal artery). Accessory renal veins were present on both sides. The right testicular artery was arising from the lower accessory renal artery. The left testicular artery was looping around the inferior tributary of the left renal vein, whereby forming a sharp kink.

40|$|Aortoiliac surgery {{performed}} in renal transplant recipients carries {{the risk of}} inducing a prolonged period of ischemia that can threaten organ survival.

40|$|Objective: To {{present a}} model for {{research}} and training inmultivisceral transplantation in pigs. Methods: Eight LargeWhite pigs (four donors and four recipients) were operated. Themultivisceral transplant with stomach, duodenum, pancreas,liver and intestine was performed similarly to transplantation inhumans with a few differences, described below. Anastomoseswere performed as follows: end-to-end from the supra-hepaticvena cava of the graft to the recipient juxta diaphragmatic venacava; end-to-end from the infra-hepatic vena cava of the graftto the <b>inferior</b> (<b>suprarenal)</b> vena cava of the recipient; and endto-side patch of the aorta of the graft to the infrarenal aortaof the recipient plus digestive reconstruction. Results: Theperformance of the multivisceral transplantion was possible inall four animals. Reperfusions of the multivisceral graft led to asevere ischemia-reperfusion syndrome, despite flushing of thegraft. The animals presented with hypotension and the need forhigh doses of vasoactive drugs, {{and all of them}} were sacrificedafter discontinuing these drugs. Conclusion: Some alternativesto minimize the ischemia-reperfusion syndrome, such as the useof another vasoactive drug, use of a third pig merely for bloodtransfusion, presence of an anesthesia team in the operatingroom, and reduction of the graft, will be the next steps to enableexperimental studies...|$|R
40|$|A precise {{knowledge}} of the vascular variations of human kidney {{is essential for the}} surgeon and radiologist to avoid complication during interventional radiological procedure, renal transplantation, renal trauma and other urological procedures. The present case report is regarding unilateral variation of renal vein and bilateral variation of renal artery. During routine cadaveric dissection of abdominal region, we observed three renal veins in right kidney. All right renal veins were emerging from hilum of kidney and drained in inferior vena cava where as in left Kidney venous drainage is normal. In right Kidney both main and accessory renal artery arose from abdominal aorta. Left main renal artery arose from abdominal aorta with left accessory renal artery arising from left middle <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery</b> which is branch of coeliac trunk. In this case right ureteropelvic junction is seen to be compressed in between right accessory renal artery and right lower renal vein which crossed anteriorly with right middle renal vein crossing posteriorly this condition may cause hydronephrosis.

40|$|Spontaneous rupture of metastatic adrenal tumor {{with massive}} retroperitoneal {{hemorrhage}} and shock is an uncommon clinical event. Herein, we report {{a case of}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), where left hepatic lobectomy and right adrena-lectomy for metastatic HCC were performed in April and August 2002, respectively. Subsequently, the patient presented {{to the emergency room}} with acute-onset severe left flank and back pain in March 2004, accompanied by a falling hemoglobin level. Computed tomography revealed a 7 -cm left adrenal tumor mass with retroperitoneal hemorrhage. The ruptured adrenal tumor was further confirmed by selective angiography, which demonstrated that the bleeder was supplied by the left <b>suprarenal</b> <b>artery.</b> Transarterial embolization (TAE) to stop tumor bleeding was performed successfully. The patient then underwent tumor resection with left adrenalectomy 5 days after the embolization, with pathology subsequently revealing metastatic HCC. The recurrent intrahepatic HCC was controlled with TAE, and the patient underwent hormone replacement therapy with prednisolone 10 mg/day. Metastatic adrenal tumor bleeding should be suspected in hepatoma patients who suffer abrupt flank pain and shock. Hemodynamically unstable patients require supportive transfusions and urgent surgical exploration. Angiographic embolization, if deemed feasible, may be a valuable adjunct for achievement of hemostasis prior to definite surgery...|$|R
