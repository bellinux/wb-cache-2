5000|$|A <b>folding</b> <b>machine</b> is {{a machine}} used {{primarily}} for the folding of paper.

The Church used a small school house, located across the main road, for Sunday School classes. By 1968 the church had torn down the old school house and built a new facility, which stands at the present. The former building was sold to AutoMecha - a company that manufactured paper <b>folding</b> <b>machines.</b> After a few years of operation, the AutoMecha building burned to the ground and the owner, a Mr. Brown, sold the vacant property back to the Church for $1.00 with the understanding that the Church would remove the remains of the building.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{physical}} properties of highly deformable {{objects such as}} clothing poses a challenging problem for autonomously acting systems. Especially, grasping and manipulation require new approaches that can accommodate for an object’s variable and changing appearance. In this paper, we present {{a system that is}} capable of fully autonomously transforming a clothing item from a random crumpled configuration into a folded state. We describe a method to compute valid grasp poses on the cloth which accounts for deformability. Our algorithm includes a novel fold detection and grasp generation strategy, which suggests grasp poses on cloth <b>folds.</b> <b>Machine</b> learning techniques are used to evaluate these grasp poses. In our experiments, we use a stock PR 2 robot whose two arms alternatingly perform grasps on a T-shirt equipped with fiducial markers. The goal of this grasp sequence is to bring the T-shirt into a configuration from which the robot can fold it. In several experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our approach. I...|$|R

50|$|Over time, the proteostasis network becomes {{burdened}} with proteins modified by {{reactive oxygen species}} and metabolites that induce oxidative damage. These byproducts can react with cellular proteins to cause misfolding and aggregation (especially in nondividing cells like neurons). This risk is particularly high for intrinsically disordered proteins. The IGFR-1 pathway {{has been shown in}} C. elegans to protect against these harmful aggregates, and some experimental work has suggested that upregulation of insulin growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR-1) may stabilize proteostatic network and prevent detrimental effects of aging. Expression of the chaperome, the ensemble of chaperones and co-chaperones that interact in a complex network of molecular <b>folding</b> <b>machines</b> to regulate proteome function, is dramatically repressed in human aging brains and in the brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases. Functional assays in C. elegant and human cells have identified a conserved chaperome sub-network of 16 chaperone genes, corresponding to 28 human orthologs as a proteostasis safeguard in aging and age-onset neurodegenerative disease.|$|R
