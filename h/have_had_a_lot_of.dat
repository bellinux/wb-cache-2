Matters that <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> {{controversy}} include Strepsiptera and Diptera grouped together as Halteria based on a reduction {{of one of the}} wing pairs – a position not well-supported in the entomological community. The Neuropterida are often lumped or split on the whims of the taxonomist. Fleas are now thought to be closely related to boreid mecopterans. Many questions remain to be answered when it comes to basal relationships amongst endopterygote orders, particularly Hymenoptera.|$|E
25|$|Taíno {{society was}} based on a matrilineal system, meaning that descent was traced through the mother and that women lived {{together}} with other women and their children apart from the men. Because of this Taíno women seem to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> control over their lives, their co-villagers and their bodies. Since they lived separately from men, they were able to decide when they wanted to involve in sexual contact. This is in part what shaped the views of conquistadors who came in contact with Taíno culture. They reportedly perceived women as “macho women” who had strong control over the men.|$|E
500|$|IGN's Chris Carabott {{rated the}} episode 6.8/10, {{explaining}} {{that after the}} premiere's [...] "exciting, new direction" [...] of an episode, [...] "The Glass Ballerina" [...] helped Lost [...] "take a step back [...] delivers nothing new or substantial". He felt the flashbacks were repetitive and [...] "a lot more like filler than the basis for compelling television", but praised the final scene between Jack and Ben as [...] "the only compelling scene in the whole episode". On a list ranking all the Lost episodes, the Los Angeles Times ranked [...] "The Glass Ballerina" [...] 80 out of 110 episodes, explaining [...] "A good flashback (to Sun and her pre-island lover) and a terrific last scene -- wherein Jack learns the Sox won the Series -- can't make up for a listless on-island plot." [...] On a similar list, IGN rated the episode 106 out of 113 episodes, writing [...] "it felt appropriate for Losts third season to begin with an episode only featuring Jack, Sawyer and Kate, since their abduction by the Others {{was a big part}} of Season 2's conclusion. But having episode two of the season also focus so much on these three, with almost no plot momentum, was frustrating and rather uninteresting. Meanwhile, we do pick up with Sayid, Sun and Jin, but it's really only for yet another 'Sun and Jin <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> big issues in their marriage' flashback – a topic we were well familiar with at this point." ...|$|E

500|$|During the action, Tiger {{was hit by}} six German shells, {{the most}} {{significant}} {{of which was a}} [...] shell that burst on the roof of 'Q' turret. Although most of the shell was deflected overboard, fragments penetrated the roof, damaged the left gun's breech mechanism and jammed the training gear, knocking the turret out of action. Ten men were killed during the battle and 11 wounded. Tigers repairs were completed on 8 February. Like the rest of the battlecruisers, Tigers own gunnery was rapid, but inaccurate, and she achieved only two hits out of 355 [...] shells fired, scoring one hit each on Seydlitz and [...] Her performance was noted and commented upon by the senior leadership of the Royal Navy: Lord Fisher criticised Pelly's performance, calling him a [...] "" [...] and adding [...] "The Tigers gunnery seems to have been villainously bad on January 24, yet she seems to <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> practice.". In a memorandum of 11 February 1915 Beatty explained to Pelly where the latter had misconstrued the standing orders, going through Tigers part in the battle blow by blow and comparing it to that of other ships. His final paragraph was conciliatory however: [...] "In making these remarks I have no wish to express censure in any form. I realise that a newly-commissioned ship in her first action has many difficulties to contend with, and I am quite ready to make the fullest allowance for them. My chief aim is to ensure that our next action shall be a complete success." [...] The ship was given a refit in December 1915.|$|E
500|$|The {{sport of}} target rifle {{shooting}} {{is an option}} among those in the 3rd year and above, but only available {{to members of the}} CCF from 4th form. In the first and second years, there is an air rifle club, which teaches basics before moving onto [...] "rifles". From 3rd form students can join an afternoon shooting club in which they can practice smallbore. At this point being a member of CCF is not needed because CCF starts from 3rd form since the introduction of the EXAD program to 3rd formers. 3rd form students start of with grouping targets using sandbags then progress onto 5 bull and eventually 5 bull and country life style shooting using slings and jackets. However as of 2016/17 the number 8 cadet rifles are being brought out of service so 3rd form shooting has mostly been done using [...] "private" [...] Anschutz rifles. Normally students wouldn't start shooting these rifles until 4th form but due to the situation they have to use these rifles.Those individuals who have talent in smallbore then have the opportunity to shoot fullbore in the summer term during some weekends and even have the chance to take part in competitions such as schools meet or the L In 4th form During the first two terms they do smallbore shooting with 10 bull being the main focus. 10 Bull is done using the private rifles that are more expensive and more accurate than the number 8s. In the trinity term they do fullbore using the L81a2 cadet target rifle.Though they usually have smaller numbers during the summer due to logistical issues and the fact that other [...] "fun"games options are also available such as tennis and sailing. All fullbore shooting is done at Bisley either at Century where they shoot at 300, 500 and 600 yards, or Stickledown range where they can shoot up to 1200 yards though this rarely happens during practice and is instead reserved for the Imperial meeting. In 2017 the RGS entered a main VIII and two cadet pairs into the Schools Meet as well as 4 boys into the NRA Imperial and 2 boys into the Cadets Imperial a newer competition that started in 2016. The RGS also took part in many postal competitions such as the Country life and the Surrey 10 bull league competitions. Over the years the shooting team <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> success, not only winning many smallbore competitions such as the Staniforth and the Country Life, but also winning the Ashburton at the Annual Schools Meeting held at Bisley, though this hasn't been done by the school for many years. Part of this success is down to the help of many Old Guildfordians and current teachers coaching and helping out those doing shooting at the RGS. Many senior boys also coach the younger students and encourage them to keep shooting as they progress through the school. Those in the team are taught by the Old Guildfordians and shooting masters how to self sight and even self wind coach so that they can take part in more individual competitions such as the Imperial. Countless RGS shooters have gone on to become top level shooters competing at a national level representing Great Britain as well as achieving great individual success such as winning the Queens prize. Ex RGS students have also had great success shooting in Schools Veterans competitions under the Old Guildfordians Rifle club. The Old Guildfordians is a home office approved shooting club and has a club house down at Bisley nicknamed the OG hut or Jabba the hut. The OGs are known for their hilarious antics such as making making members carry around object such as pineapples or melons as a punishment for dropping a point on their last shot or doing silly things such as forgetting their rifles ...|$|E

2500|$|... 1998 saw Earnhardt finally win the Daytona 500 in his 20th attempt {{after being}} shut {{out in his}} {{previous}} 19 attempts. He began the season by winning his Twin 125-mile qualifier race for the ninth straight year, and the week before {{was the first to}} drive around the track under the newly installed lights, for coincidentally 20 times. On race day, he showed himself to be a contender early. Halfway through the race, however, it seemed that Jeff Gordon had the upper hand. But by lap 138, Earnhardt had taken the lead and thanks to a push by teammate Mike Skinner, he maintained it. Earnhardt made it to the caution-checkered flag before Bobby Labonte. Afterwards, there was a large show of respect for Earnhardt, in which every crew member of every team lined pit road to shake his hand {{as he made his way}} to victory lane. Earnhardt then drove his No. 3 into the infield grass, starting a trend of post-race celebrations. He spun the car twice, throwing grass and leaving tire tracks in the shape of a No. 3 in the grass. He then spoke about the victory, saying, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> great fans and people behind me all through the years and I just can't thank them enough. The Daytona 500 is ours. We won it, we won it, we won it!" [...] The rest of the season did not go as well, and the 500 was his only victory that year. Despite that, he did almost pull off a Daytona sweep, where he was one of the contenders for the win in the first nighttime Pepsi 400, but a pit stop late in the race in which he caught a rogue tire like a hockey puck cost him the race win. He slipped to 12th in the point standings halfway through the season, and Richard Childress decided to make a crew chief change, taking Mike Skinner's crew chief Kevin Hamlin and putting him with Earnhardt while giving Skinner Larry McReynolds (Earnhardt's crew chief). Earnhardt finished eighth in the final standings.|$|E
