The purpose of this study is to explore stylistic features of <b>informative</b> and comparative <b>advertising</b> texts.

Product differentiation also has welfare implications for the effect of technological change in the advertising sector.

40|$|In this paper, {{a dynamic}} {{continuous}} time model, encompassing operations, investments, output prices, <b>informative</b> <b>advertising,</b> and brand advertising, is formulated as an optimal control problem {{in an activity}} analysis context. In the model, {{the objective of the}} firm is to maximise, subject to various constraints, the discounted value of accumulated savings over the finite decision-making interval plus the discounted value of capacity {{at the end of the}} interval. The state variables are capacity, goodwill of type 1 reflecting <b>informative</b> <b>advertising,</b> goodwill of type 2 reflecting brand advertising, net debt, and the output price. The controls are the scale of operation, the purchase of new capacity, <b>informative</b> <b>advertising,</b> brand advertising, and the rate of change of the output price. Final capacity, goodwill of types 1 and 2, net debt, and price are control parameters. There are several inequality constraints. Using results in control theory, the optimal controls are completely characterized. These results are interpreted using the properties of the Value Equation. In addition, the control problem is transformed into an approximate programming problem. ...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Is {{advertising}} anticompetitive? One {{school of}} thought in industrial economics holds that advertising increases profits and reduces consumer welfare by creating spurious product differentiation and barriers to entry. Another school focuses on the <b>informative</b> character of <b>advertising,</b> claiming that advertising makes markets more competitive and reduces profits by supplying consumers with information about price and quality. We distinguish these views by examining the effect of advertising on competition in the US automobile industry. Our data include advertising, sales, profit, and market-share figures for General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler over a 25 -year period from 1970 to 1994. We ask if advertising increases or decreases profitability, controlling for market structure and other factors affecting demand. We find that these firms cannot increase their profits above normal levels by increasing their advertising expenditures.

If <b>advertising</b> is <b>informative,</b> restricting it should increase the market shares of older, better-known brands and decrease the market shares of newer and/or less well known brands.
