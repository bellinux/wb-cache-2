50|$|Among the {{two types}} of silicon steel, <b>grain-oriented</b> (GO) and grain non-oriented (GNO), GO is most {{desirable}} for magnetic cores. It is anisotropic, offering better magnetic properties than GNO in one direction. As the magnetic field in inductor and transformer cores is always along the same direction, it is an advantage to use grain oriented steel in the preferred orientation. Rotating machines, where the direction of the magnetic field can change, gain no benefit from <b>grain-oriented</b> steel.|$|E

50|$|<b>Grain-oriented</b> {{electrical}} steel usually has a silicon level of 3% (Si:11Fe). It is processed {{in such a}} way that the optimal properties are developed in the rolling direction, due to a tight control (proposed by Norman P. Goss) of the crystal orientation relative to the sheet. The magnetic flux density is increased by 30% in the coil rolling direction, although its magnetic saturation is decreased by 5%. It is used for the cores of power and distribution transformers, cold-rolled <b>grain-oriented</b> steel is often abbreviated to CRGO.|$|E

50|$|If all {{conditions}} are {{as defined in}} the standard, the standard deviation of the reproducibility of the values is not greater than 1.5% up to 1.5 T for non-oriented electrical steel and up to 1.7 T for <b>grain-oriented</b> electrical steel.|$|E
5000|$|CRGO {{is usually}} {{supplied}} by the producing mills in coil form {{and has to be}} cut into [...] "laminations", which are then used to form a transformer core, which {{is an integral part of}} any transformer. <b>Grain-oriented</b> steel is used in large power and distribution transformers and in certain audio output transformers.|$|E
50|$|CRNGO is less {{expensive}} than CRGO. It is used when cost {{is more important than}} efficiency and for applications where the direction of magnetic flux is not constant, as in electric motors and generators with moving parts.

5000|$|Bitter {{patterns}} are a technique for imaging magnetic domains that were first observed by Francis Bitter. [...] The technique involves placing a small quantity of ferrofluid {{on the surface}} of a ferromagnetic material. The ferrofluid arranges itself along magnetic domain walls, which have higher magnetic flux than the regions of the material located within domains.A modified Bitter technique has been incorporated into a widely used device, the Large Area Domain Viewer, which is particularly useful in the examination of <b>grain-oriented</b> silicon steels.|$|E
50|$|In {{the design}} of the Lynch motor armature, the iron {{laminations}} are made from individual thin rectangular pieces slotted together to form a full circular ring. Because magnetic flux passes sideways through the laminations along one axis only, it is possible to use <b>grain-oriented</b> material normally used in large transformers. This has much better magnetic properties along the grain orientation but worse properties in other directions. In a traditional electric motor it gives little or no benefit, but in the Lynch motor leads to higher efficiencies.|$|E
50|$|The {{stator core}} is built with lamination's of cold rolled <b>grain-oriented</b> sheet steel 0.013 in (0.033cm) thick, {{insulated}} {{from each other}} with insuline. The number of segments per circle is arranged so that the maximum practical percentage of core flux is {{in the direction of}} the oriented grain. The rings of lamination's are built into a skeleton frame which is flexibly supported inside the main stator frame to prevent double-frequency vibrations being transmitted to the foundations. Axial gas passages are provided within the core by holes punched in the lamination's, which line up throughout its length. The ends of the core are divided axially by spacers into a number of radial ducts. These ducts form the gas inlet and outlet passages for the axial gas passages. Separate radial ducts feed the extreme ends of the core with cold gas to cater for the increased heating experienced at the core ends during leading power factor operation. Each coil side of the stator winding consists of rectangular copper tubes, each tube being insulated with resin-impregnated glass braid, and the tubes are transposed within the coil length by the Roebel method to minimise stray copper losses. Inlet and outlet manifolds are arranged at opposite ends of the windings and all coil sides are fed in parallel from these. The water connections between the manifolds and coil sides are made with flexible hoses of insulating material. The electrical connections between coil sides consist of flexible copper straps, bolted and sweated to contact blocks which are brazed to the conductor tubes near to the end of each coil side. The rings used to connect up the phase groups to the terminals are also water cooled, the flow through these being in parallel with the flow through the coil sides.|$|E

When the cold rolling reduction is 70 %,RD//〈 001 〉 recrystallization texture is the sharpest, and the magnetic performance is the best. The higher degree of Goss orientation in initial sample is, the better magnetic performance of ultra-thin <b>grain-oriented</b> silicon steel.

The specific arrangement {{is based on}} experimental evidence concerning the peak flux density non-uniformity of the typical three-phase five legged wound transformer core, constructed of the high magnetization <b>grain-oriented</b> steel. Since the peak flux density of the two outer cores {{is lower than the}} two internal cores, low cost, low permeability, conventional <b>grain-oriented</b> electrical steel can be used for the outer cores.

40|$|Precipitates in {{the form}} of grain growth inhibitors play an {{essential}} role in the production of <b>grain-oriented</b> electrical steels, as they promote the development of Goss texture during secondary recrystallization. However, the presence of precipitates in the final material can have a detrimental effect on loss and permeability, as they impede domain wall motion during the magnetization process. In previous work [K. Jenkins and M. Lindenmo, J. Magn. Magn. Mater. 320, 2423 (2008) ], a conventional <b>grain-oriented</b> electrical steel was presented that contained very fine precipitates, which did not damage the bulk magnetic properties.

40|$|Barkhausen noise (BN) {{measurements}} {{were performed on}} samples of high permeability and conventional <b>grain-oriented</b> steels at both high and low flux densities in order to investigate the characteristics in each magnetization regimes. Previous works deal with measurements of Barkhausen noise carried out at high flux densities (0. 2 T and above) but this work demonstrates that Barkhausen noise has different characteristics at low flux densities (8 mT to 0. 2 T). The {{results show that the}} amplitude sum and the RMS Barkhausen signals are higher for High Permeability <b>Grain-Oriented</b> (HGO) steel than Conventional <b>Grain-Oriented</b> (CGO) steel at high flux densities because the grain size of HGO is higher than that of CGO. Domain wall spacing increases with increasing grain size. Hence increased grain size means domain walls move further between pinning sites resulting in larger BN signal. Below 0. 2 T, the BN signal becomes higher for CGO steel. HGO samples were mechanically scribed on one surface transverse to the rolling direction. It was observed that scribing reduced the BN amplitude at high flux densities. This is due to the decrease of domain width by scribing. Then the trend reverses again at low flux density...|$|E
40|$|A new {{hysteresis}} operator for {{the simulation}} of Goss-textured ferromagnets is here defined. The operator {{is derived from}} the classic Stoner–Wohlfarth model, where the anisotropy energy is assumed to be cubic instead of uniaxial, in order to reproduce the magnetic behavior of Goss textured ferromagnetic materials, such as <b>grain-oriented</b> Fe–Si alloys, Ni–Fe alloys, and Ni–Co alloys. A vector hysteresis model based on a single hysteresis operator is then implemented and used for the prediction of the rotational magnetizations that have been measured in a sample of <b>grain-oriented</b> electrical steel. This is especially promising for FEM based calculations, where the magnetization state in each point must be recalculated at each time step.

40|$|International audienceThe {{anisotropy}} {{of magnetic}} properties in <b>grain-oriented</b> steels {{is related to}} their microstructure.

The magnetization process along arbitrary directions can be explained using phase equilibrium for domain patterns, which can be described using Neel's phase theory.

This paper presents an approach to model hysteresis loops of <b>grain-oriented</b> steels along arbitrary in-plane directions.
