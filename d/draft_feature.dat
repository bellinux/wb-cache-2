Students {{were asked to}} write and then revise their <b>draft.</b> <b>Feature</b> analytical rating was completed on each S's draft and revision, with scoring performed on content, linguistic considerations, and surface mechanics (spelling, punctuation, legibility, and minor grammatical errors).

Contrary to hypotheses, good writers did not make more changes (i. e., improvements) from draft to revised writing than poor writers.

The thesis analyzes all possible positive and negative aspects of technological progress. The threats are described as social dependence on the machines and {{as well as the}} gradual moving out people from jobs. The existing system of capitalism below this technology cannot resist pressure and the pressure is a threat of his crash. The question remains to what kind of system should our civilization has to survive. Here come to the word famous futurologists, economists, sociologists, psychologists and architects. These groups of people are trying to sketch a rough <b>draft</b> <b>feature</b> of the future system. The threat of collapse of civilization can be averted. Unfortunately, each of them has their own vision and mostly of them work individually on their projects of new world. My task was to unify visions and to create a realistic vision of the whole society. The second part of my work describes the vision of these famous people and tries to find their mutual consistency. All of the visions have some deficiencies, or they are not well thought out in all aspects, so my other goal was to try to eliminate these defects or minimize them. The task for this thesis is to unite the ideas of contemporary visionaries and convince conservatives that it is not only possible to create a new social system, but rather also necessary...|$|E
