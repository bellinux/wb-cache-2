Study Design. Case series with planned data collection. Setting. Päijät-Häme Central Hospital, Finland—a single ear, nose, and throat (ENT) hospital department serving a popu-lation of 216, 000. Subjects and Methods. Fourteen patients had a large open radical cavity with recurrent infections. Two ears had discharge and pain after simple mastoidectomy. A re-mastoidectomy included support of the cavity skin and obliteration with BG. The mean follow-up time was 2. 2 years. Results. All ears became dry. One reoperation was needed as the fascia support to the ear canal (EC) skin was too weak, {{and part of the}} BG leaked into the EC. The ear stayed dry, and the missing BG was replaced in a reoperation. A slightly short musculoperiosteal <b>flap</b> <b>supported</b> the EC skin in 1 ear. A minor amount of BG leaked into the EC.

This study revealed the coordinated appearance of the three structures as well as loss of tubercles in one clade.

40|$|Malignant tumours of {{the upper}} gum and hard palate account for 1 - 5 % of {{malignant}} neoplasms of the oral cavity; {{two thirds of the}} lesions which involve these areas are squamous cell carcinomas. Most of these carcinomas are diagnosed late, when they invade the underlying bone. The procedures of choice for removal are: alveolectomy, palatectomy, maxillectomy, which may be total or partial. Surgical reconstruction of the defect may be carried out using a wide range of microvascularized flaps: osteomuscolocutaneous of the internal iliac crest, an osteocutaneous flap of the fibula or scapula, fascia, or osteocutaneous radial flap, or a pedicled flap of temporal muscle. These <b>flaps</b> are <b>supported</b> by single or multiple obturator prostheses. Rehabilitation via palatal obturators is preferred in patients with a poor prognosis or in weak condition. Rehabilitation aims to: restore the separation between the oral and nasal cavities, enable the patient to swallow, maintain or provide mastication, sufficient occlusion and mandibular support, support the soft facial tissues, re-establish speech and restore an aesthetically pleasing smile.

40|$|Objective: Vascular graft {{infections are}} rare {{complications}} but {{can lead to}} life-threatening outcomes for the patient. Conventional treatment methods are {{the removal of the}} vascular graft and an extra-anatomic by-pass procedure. Unfortunately, this treatment presents high morbidity and mortality rates. Treatment of the deep-level perivascular synthetic graft infection and closure of exposed vascular graft reduce graft infection, thereby help to reduce mortality and morbidity rates. Material and Methods: Between 2009 - 2013 seven cases of complicated defect that involved perivascular graft infection in the inguinal region were performed using omega advancement flaps. In this technique, a circular-shaped flap with a diameter corresponding to the defect was planned adjacent to the defect after debridement of the infected perivascular and the necrotic skin areas. To facilitate the advancement of the <b>flap</b> and to <b>support</b> the subcutaneous region, deepithelialized equilateral triangular flaps were designed {{on both sides of the}} main circular flap. Results: Wound dehiscence and infection recurrence did not occur in the follow-up period. No secondary surgeries were required to change the segment of the vascular graft.

Hitherto, these two flaps have not been compared systematically in terms of patient satisfaction and functional outcome. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare patients’ satisfaction and functional outcome following ALT vs. MLD transfer. Methods: Thirty-six patients were divided into an ALT group (n= 22, mean age: 42. 0 years) and a MLD group (n= 14, mean age: 55. 5 years). Both groups were compared concerning isokinetic analysis (Biodex System III), circumference measurement, flap volume, scar size, complication rates, patients’ satisfaction, and functional outcome (SF- 36 questionnaire, Foot and Ankle Outcome Score (FAOS)), hospital stay and duration of surgery. Results: Isokinetic force measurements showed a higher mean maximum force for dorsiflexion in the MLD group at an angular velocity of 60 °/sec.

40|$|Background: Secondary venous {{ischemia}} {{caused by}} anastomotic failure {{is one of}} the major reasons for the lack of success in free flap surgeries. Development of damage can be mediated with single or multiple drugs. This study examined the effects of allopurinol, cyclosporine A, and deferoxamine as monotherapies and combination therapies on inguinal island flap in rats. Material and Methods: 54 rats were divided into the following nine groups containing six animals each as controls, monotherapies, and combination therapies. Intravenous cyclosporine A (30 mg/kg), allopurinol (100 mg/kg), and deferoxamine (150 mg/kg) were administered after secondary venous ischemia. One hour after termination of the secondary venous ischemia, a biopsy was removed for biochemical (levels of malondialdehyde, the last product of lipid peroxidation; myeloperoxidase, the indicator of neutrophil infiltration; and glutathione, a potent cellular antioxidant) and histopathological (neutrophil count, an indicator of tissue inflammation) assessment. Flap viability was examined on the seventh day following surgery. Results: The treatment groups had greater flap viability and glutathione levels, and lower levels of malondialdehyde, myeloperoxidase, and neutrophil count. The differences between the control, monotherapy and combination therapy groups were significant (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The beneficial effect of allopurinol, previously demonstrated in primary ischemia models and arterial ischemia models, was also seen in the secondary venous ischemia model. Dual and triple combinations were more effective than monotherapies in terms of the viability of the <b>flap.</b> These results <b>supported</b> our hypothesis that combination therapies with these agents progressively decrease ischemic damage.

40|$|Flexible {{flapping}} wings have garnered a {{large amount}} of attention within the micro aerial vehicle (MAV) community: a critical component of MAV flight is the coupling of aerodynamics and structural dynamics. This dissertation presents a computational approach for simulating beam/shell-like wing structures flapping in incompressible flow at low Reynolds numbers in both hover and forward flight. Several nonlinear structural solutions of variable fidelity are coupled to an in-house developed pressure-based Navier-Stokes solution in a partitioned framework in which the nonlinear partial differential equations modeling the dynamic behavior of the fluid and the structure are solved independently with boundary information shared between each other. In the initial part of dissertation, the development of a nonlinear structural dynamics solution suitable for flapping wings using the co-rotational approach is discussed. Next, the development of a suite of computational aeroelastic solutions is discussed. Verification and partial validation studies are presented for both the structural dynamics and the aeroelastic solvers using different wing configurations. Case studies are presented for three different flexible wing configurations: rectangular wings with pure prescribed plunge motion, an elliptic wing with pure prescribed flap rotation, and a rectangular wing also prescribed with pure flap rotation. Numerical studies of the plunging wings showed that within the range of non-dimensional parameters considered, only a limited amount of spanwise flexibility is favorable for thrust generation. It was found {{that in the case of}} the most flexible plunging wing configuration, the instantantaneous angle of attack at most sections along the wing span decreased relative to other wings of lower flexibility. This was identified as being responsible for the decrease in the aerodynamic forces generated. Further, issues related to coupling strategies, fluid physics associated with rigid and flexible wings, and phase lag between prescribed motion and response were carefully examined. Preliminary aeroelastic studies on the rectangular and elliptic flapping configurations indicated that within the range of parameters considered, aerodynamic forces could be enhanced due to wing flexibility. The nonlinear aeroelastic framework developed will enable comprehensive analysis of <b>flapping</b> wings in <b>support</b> of future experimental tests and ultimately lead to identification of new MAV flapping wing concepts...|$|R
30|$|The {{paediatric}} population rarely suffer malignant {{disease of the}} oral cavity requiring any form of maxillectomy, {{and there is little}} published evidence around the rehabilitation and restorative management of children undergoing such procedures. The seemingly most common approach for a limited low-level maxillary resection in a child would be to consider resection and simple prosthetic obturation as this allows relatively simple management of the tumour from a surgical point of view as well as immediate functional and aesthetic rehabilitation with a prosthesis. It also allows for full histopathological examination of the resected specimen to ensure complete resection of the tumour before committing the patient to any form of complex surgical reconstruction which could be planned at a later date should the patient wish. The delivery of a maxillary obturator improves quality of life significantly by primarily restoring aesthetic and functional modalities. It also serves as a purpose to allow correct phonation of speech, prevent nasal discharge of masticatory contents and facilitate swallowing. The aesthetic and psychological benefits of facial restoration are paramount in a child undergoing such a procedure. The use of microvascular reconstruction techniques have allowed for autogenous tissue reconstruction of maxillary defects with either soft or hard tissue. The use of a soft-tissue-only reconstruction such as a radial forearm flap in this clinical situation would prevent successful dental rehabilitation as the soft tissue <b>flap</b> provides no <b>support</b> for the dental prosthesis and, apart from the separation of the oral and nasal cavities, provides no advantage for the patient. The use of a composite-bone-containing flap such as the fibula flap has the potential to provide oro-nasal separation as well as bone to support an implant-retained prosthesis, and with the latest digital technologies, this can be provided rapidly in carefully selected cases [8], although this mode of rapid rehabilitation is not available in many centres. However, there is no published data on this mode of dental rehabilitation in a growing child currently, and this approach should probably be deferred until all mandibular growth has been completed. The use of microvascular reconstruction, in addition, carries with it significant clinical risks as well as potential donor site morbidity and flap failure as well as the potential for fibrous union and loss of individual bony segments where multiple osteotomies are required.|$|R
