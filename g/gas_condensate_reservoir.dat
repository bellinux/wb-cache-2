50|$|The Pazanan {{oil field}} is an Iranian {{oil and natural}} gas field that is located in 170 km South East of Ahvaz in Khuzestan {{province}} of Iran and between Aghajari and Bibi Hakimeh fields. The field is discovered in 1936. It began production in 1974 and about 119 wells have been drilled in it. This field is one of huge retrograde <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> in Iran. The total proven reserves of the Pazanan oil field are around 50 trillion cubic feet (1430×109m3) and production is slated to be around 750 million cubic feet/day (22×106m3) and around 31000 bpd.|$|E
50|$|The first project {{handled by}} Crescent was the Mubarek Field {{off the coast}} of UAE. Within 13 months from the discovery, it was on full {{production}} at a rate of over 60,000 barrels of oil per day, with the drilling of three additional wells, the installation of the processing platform, an additional well-head platform, export loading terminal, and associated support structures and pipelines. This was a world record at the time for bringing an offshore field on-stream from oil discovery. Crescent Petroleum has also earned several operational world records including the deepest short radius horizontal section drilled, and the deepest slim hole to be cased by expandable casing. Since the start of production in 1974, the Mubarek Field has undergone several development phases. The initial phase of the development of Ilam/Mishrif oil reservoir, at a depth of 3800 m was completed in 1977. Development of the Thamama <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir,</b> at a depth of 4700 m, was started in 1987 for production of the gas and condensate. A central gas processing facility was established in the early 1990s, and gas export to Jebel Ali through a 150 km offshore pipeline was constructed. In late 2005, the company commenced a program of drilling further infill wells to increase production of petroleum.|$|E

40|$|In the {{petroleum}} industry, <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> {{are becoming more}} common as exploration targets.

The condensation process causes a reduction of the gas productivity (1). It has been reported in the literature that there is an increasing gas mobility zone due to a capillary number effect in the immediate vicinity of the wellbore in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> (2). This zone, called “velocitystripping zone”, compensates the well productivity loss due to the condensate drop-out. However, existence of this zone has just been recently found in an actual well test data (3, 4). There is no conclusive study of this velocity-stripping zone in this type of reservoir.

40|$|AbstractTechniques of {{production}} data analysis for single-phase {{oil and gas}} reservoirs have advanced significantly {{over the past few}} years. These techniques range from traditional (Arps and Fetkovich) to modern (for the variation of operating conditions at the wellbore). The application of these techniques for analysis of the production data of a <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> may not yield reliable answers {{due to the fact that}} the flow of fluid in gas condensate reservoirs is not single-phase. This paper presents the treatment of a modern method {{of production}} data analysis (single-phase flow) to analyze the production data of a <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> (two-phase flow). For this purpose, a single-phase production model is presented. Using a compositional reservoir simulator, long-term production data is generated over a wide range of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> parameters. Next, a comparison is made between the simulator results (gas condensate) and the corresponding single-phase gas reservoir, using a modern production analysis method. The error for each case is analyzed, and a correlation for treatment of the single-phase analysis method is developed. Our results show that the methodology developed here can be successfully applied for analysis of the production data of a <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir...</b>|$|E
40|$|Gas <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> usually exhibit complex flow {{behaviors}} {{because of}} propagation response of pressure {{drop from the}} wellbore into the reservoir.

3000|$|The {{radius of}} {{accumulated}} condensates region around the {{well in a}} <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> {{as a function of}} time, gas velocity, rock and fluid properties was determined (Muskat 1949). Flow equations in fracture were developed for the first time (Barrenblatt et al. 1960). Primary theory for single-phase flow in fracture was developed (Warren and Root 1963). Then, these equations for fluid flow numerical simulation by Kazemi et al. were applied. The first model for gas condensate pressure and saturation prediction around production well was developed (Kniazeff and Naville 1965; Eilerts et al. 1965). Gas condensate recovery by computer programming and finite difference method was modeled (Eilerts et al. 1965). Pseudo-pressure for gas phase was developed {{for the first time to}} investigate of gas condensate accumulation in steady-state regime (O’Dell and Miller 1967). A simulator for reservoir simulation with compositional method was developed (Roebuck and Henderson 1969). Kazemi considered block matrix as a cylindrical thick layer and fracture as a thin layer between them. Then, by consideration no connection between block matrix and boundary conditions, solved flow equations and determined pressure as a function of time and location (Kazemi 1969). Gas condensate phase behavior on porous media was investigated (Saeidi and Handy 1974). A model was developed which fracture network in Warren–Root model was replaced with a vertical fracture (Cinco-Ley et al. 1985). Triple porosity model with two various porosity block matrix was developed (Abdassah and Ershaghi 1986). An equation for determination fracture network permeability was developed (Jones et al. 1988). Effect of surface tension on gas and condensate relative permeability was investigated (Asar and Handy 1988). A <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> including a mixture of three hydrocarbons with compositional and fully implicit method was modeled (Jones and Raghavan 1988). Gas injection into <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> in 2 -D was simulated, and simulation results with finite difference method were compared (Chang et al. 1991). Effect of gas condensate accumulation on production reduction was investigated (Afidick et al. 1994). By gridding around well, a reservoir was simulated (Malachowski et al. 1995). A method for determination of gas relative permeability in oil reservoir with associate gas was developed (Hatzignatiou and Reynolds 1996). A model was developed which block matrix size is not same in it, but in the Warren–Root model is same (Rice 1997). Dual porosity–dual permeability model for single-phase flow was developed (Cather et al. 1998). Phase behavior around well according to non-Darcy flow was modeled (Coats et al. 1998). A method for modeling gas and condensate relative permeability was determined (Fevang and Whitson 1999). Relative permeability in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> as a function of the capillary number was determined (Henderson et al. 2000). An experimental method was developed which relative permeability around well in steady-state, high-pressure and high-velocity conditions was determined (Mott 2000). Effect of the capillary number and the non-Darcy flow on phase’s relative permeability in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> were investigated (Penuela et al. 2002). Equations of gas injection into <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> were solved, and MMP was determined (Seto et al. 2003). A method for determining gas condensate ratio was developed (Mott 2003). Miscibility variation in gas injection into <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> with numerical method was investigated (Hoier et al. 2004). Four porosity model including fracture network with three various properties fractures was developed (Dreier et al. 2004). MMP in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> by injecting NGL and CO 2 with the help of Peng–Robinson, Patel–Teja, Patel–Teja–Valderrama and Esmaielzadeh–Roshanfekr EOS was determined (Esmaeilzadeh and Roshanfekr 2006). Simulation of gas condensate well with pseudo-pressure method was developed (Bonyadi 2006). A 2 -D and single-phase model of fracture gas reservoir was developed (Shane and Hattingh 2009). Another technique for applying mathematical modeling in petroleum reservoirs is the model based on the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) that was applied to determine the oil-CO 2 molecular diffusion coefficient in the secondary and tertiary production mechanisms such as CO 2 miscible injection as well as applying the particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the ANFIS model parameters, that can be applied in the numerical simulation of petroleum reservoirs (Ejraei Bakyani et al. 2016 a). Finally, based on the linear regression technique, several empirical relationships of two-phase (gas–water) relative permeabilities through fracture were obtained for the various conditions both the smooth and the rough parallel fractures during the imbibition and the drainage mechanisms that can be applied in the numerical simulation of two-phase flow through fractured reservoirs (Ejraei Bakyani et al. 2016 b).|$|E

30|$|Some {{researchers}} {{now believe}} that <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are another possible site for CCS because the rise in formation pressure caused by a SCCO 2 injection can enhance condensate oil recovery (Sobers et al. 2004; Mbarrufet et al. 2009; Ramharack et al. 2010).

30|$|To {{cover all}} {{objectives}} stated before, three {{different sets of}} data are used. The first aim is to improve compositional gradient prediction by utilizing suitable correlations for calculating molecular diffusion coefficients in gas mixture. For this purpose, a set of data from a <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> reported by Ghorayeb and Firoozabadi (2000) is employed which is shown in Table 1. In part 2, a sample from a supergiant <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoir</b> is chosen that is presented in Table 2. This sample is selected among more than 40 PVT samples after passing quality check based on procedure proposed by Osfouri et al. (2014). This set of data is interested because study on the compositional gradient of this supergiant reservoir {{is a part of}} comprehensive study on phase behavior of this gas condensate field. For the last part, as compositional gradient is more notable in volatile oil compare with other types of oil such as slightly volatile or black oil a volatile oil sample is selected from data reported by Hamoodi et al. (1996) refer to Table 3.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Well {{productivity}} of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> is highly affected by near-wellbore phenomena. Inertial force resulting from convective acceleration of fluid {{particles in the}} medium, as well as viscous force, determines the flow of gas through porous media at high velocity. Pressure drop builds up the molar content of water in gas by water vaporization in the near-wellbore region, which means a drop in connate water saturation. Given that the inertial force {{is a function of}} the non-Darcy coefficient, &# 946;, which itself depends upon connate water saturation, this can ultimately lessen the non-Darcy component of the pressure drop and therefore inertial forces, leading to improvement of well deliverability. Currently, no physically relevant model takes into account the non-Darcian flow coefficient variation due to this phenomenon. This paper utilizes a single-well compositional simulation to exhibit how water vaporization could compensate for the effect of inertia on well {{productivity of}} <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Perhaps {{no other}} single theme offers such {{potential}} for the petroleum industry and yet is never fully embraced as enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. Thomas et al. (2009, p. 1) concluded their review article with “it appears that <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are becoming more important throughout the world. Many international petroleum societies are beginning to have conferences specifically oriented to <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and discussing all parameters germane to such systems. ” Gas <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> however, usually experience retrograde thermodynamic conditions when the pressure falls below the dewpoint pressure. Condensate liquid saturation builds up near the wellbore first and then propagates radially away along with the pressure drop. This liquid saturation throttles the flow of gas and thus reduces the productivity of a well {{by a factor of}} two to four (Afidick et al., 1994; Barnum et al., 1995; Smits et al., 2001; Ayyalasomayajulla et al., 2005). The severity of this decline is to a large extent related to fluid phase behaviour, flow regime (Darcy or non-Darcy), interfacial forces between fluids, capillary number, basic rock and fluid properties, wettability, gravitational forces as well as well type (well inclination, fractured or non-fractured). Thomas et al. (2009, p. 4) added “ [...] . for <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> systems which exhibit high interfacial tensions where the pore throats are very small, which may correspond either to low permeability rocks or high permeability rocks but with very large coordination number, the success of flowing the liquid from the rock, once it has condensed, will be limited. In such cases, vaporisation (lean gas cycling) or injection of interfacial tension reducing agents (CO 2) may be the only option to enhance the performance. ” In their comparison of several EOR mechanisms, Ollivier and Magot (2005, p. 217) reported “since large changes in viscous forces are only possible for the recovery of heavy oil, the reduction (or entire elimination) of interfacial forces by solvents such as injection gases seems to be a practical way to achieve large changes in capillary number. ” While the majority {{of the state of the}} art publications cover sensational aspects of <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> such as phase couplings and mass transfer between original reservoir components, very little has been reported on fluid dynamics and interfacial interactions of CO 2 injection into such systems. This, along with the conceptual frameworks discussed above, serves as the motive for this research work. High pressure high temperature experimental laboratories that simulate reservoir static and thermodynamic conditions have been established to evaluate the: (1) effectiveness of CO 2 injection into <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> through interfacial tension (IFT) and spreading coefficients measurements at various reservoir conditions, (2) efficiency of the process through recovery performance and mobility ratio measurements; with special emphasis on the rate-dependent, IFT-dependent, and injection gas composition-dependant relative permeabilities, and (3) the behaviour of CO 2 injection into <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> on a field scale through numerical simulations in heterogeneous, anisotropic, fractured and faulted systems. The study also investigates the performance of various reservoir fluid thermodynamic conditions, injection design variables, and economic recovery factors associated with CO 2 injection. Condensate recovery was found to be a strong function of CO 2 injection pressure (and thus IFT), displacement flow rate, injection gas composition as well as phase behaviour and fluid properties. These parameters control the orientation and continuity of the fluid phases, solubility, gravity segregation, mobility ratio, and the ultimate recovery efficiency. Simulation analysis also suggests that developments of fractured <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> depend to a large extent on initial reservoir thermodynamic conditions (initial pore pressure and fluid composition) as well as on production operations (natural depletion, waterflooding, continuous CO 2 injection, gas injection after waterflooding GAW, or water alternating gas WAG). Much like the interrelation between accuracy and precision in science and engineering statistics, this research work draws a link between the effectiveness (quality metric through IFT measurements) and the efficiency (productivity metric through coreflooding experiments) of CO 2 injection into <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The data reported in this research work should help reservoir engineers better characterise <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> systems.

40|$|Pore-scale coupled flow of <b>gas</b> and <b>condensate</b> is {{believed}} to be the main mechanism for condensate production in low interfacial tension, IFT, <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> While coupling enhances condensate flow due to transport of condensate lenses by the gas, it dramatically reduces gas permeability by introducing capillary resistance against gas flow. In this study, a dynamic wetting approach is used to investigate the effect of viscous resistance, IFT and disjoining pressure on pore-scale coupling of <b>gas</b> and <b>condensate.</b> Disjoining pressure arises from van der Waals interactions between gas and solid through thin liquid films, e. g., condensate films on pore walls. Low values of IFT and small pore diameters, as involved in many <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> give rise to importance of disjoining pressure. Calculations show that disjoining pressure postpones <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> coupling to higher condensate flow fractions-from about,., for vanishing disjoining effect to more than,., for strong disjoining effect.

40|$|There is a {{high degree}} of {{complexity}} in both fluid flow and phase-behavior of gas condensate reservoirs during the depletion period due to retrograde condensation. Natural depletion in gas condensate reservoirs results in low condensate recoveries at surface due to in-situ condensation and accumulation of condensate in the reservoir especially in vicinity of wellbore.

Much of the current gas reserves are found in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> When these reservoirs are allowed to deplete, the pressure drops below the dew point pressure and a liquid condensate will begin to form in the wellbore or near wellbore formation, possibly affecting production. A field optimization includes determining the number of wells, type (vertical, horizontal, multilateral, etc.), trajectory and location of wells. Optimum well placement has been studied extensively for oil reservoirs. However, well placement in <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs</b> has received little attention when compared to oil. In most cases involving a homogeneous gas reservoir, the optimum well location could be determined as the center of the reservoir, but when considering the complexity of a heterogeneous reservoir with initial compositional variation, the well placement dilemma does not produce such a simple result. In this research, a horizontal well placement problem is optimized by using a modified Genetic Algorithm. The algorithm presented has been modified specifically for <b>gas</b> <b>condensate</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Unlike oil reservoirs, the cumulative production in gas reservoirs does not vary significantly (although the variation is not economically negligible) and there are possibly more local optimums. Therefore the possibility of finding better production scenarios in subsequent optimization steps is not much higher than the worse case scenarios, which delays finding the best production plan. The second modification is developed in order to find optimum well location in a reservoir with geological uncertainties.
