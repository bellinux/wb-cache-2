40|$|There {{has been}} {{extensive}} discussion concerning {{the use of}} ground based <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> for the detection and measurement of microburst features and the mapping of associated wind shears. Recent and planned research at Langley into technology and techniques useful for the future development of airborne <b>Doppler</b> weather <b>radar</b> systems for both turbulence and wind shear detection are addressed. Such systems, if successfully developed, would represent a marked increase in performance over airborne weather radars currently available.

40|$|Abstract. Doppler {{velocity}} measurements from <b>Doppler</b> weather <b>radars</b> {{can be used}} {{to estimate}} the horizontal wind field. In the past several techniques were developed for this purpose to be used during field campaigns. But only a few weather services retrieve operational the horizontal wind vector from their <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars.</b> In this paper we show {{that it is possible to}} apply successfully the known methods to the Doppler velocity measurements performed by opera-tional <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> of the Deutscher Wetterdienst. Both, single and dual Doppler techniques were applied to ensure a large area where the horizontal wind field can be estimated. ...|$|R
5|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, heterodyning {{is used to}} move {{frequencies of}} individual signals to different channels which may share a single physical transmission line. This is called frequency division multiplexing (FDM). For example, a coaxial cable used by a cable television system can carry 500 television channels {{at the same time}} because each one is given a different frequency, so they don't interfere with one another. Continuous wave (CW) <b>doppler</b> <b>radar</b> detectors are basically heterodyne detection devices that compare transmitted and reflected beams.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 57people were killed across four states and 18counties, with {{hundreds}} of others injured. The outbreak, at the time, was the deadliest {{in the era of}} modern NEXRAD <b>doppler</b> <b>radar,</b> which was fully implemented in 1997. The event was the second deadliest in February since 1950 behind the February 1971 Mississippi Valley tornado outbreak, which killed 123, the deadliest outbreak in both Tennessee and Kentucky since the 1974 Super Outbreak, and was at the time the deadliest tornado outbreak in the US overall since the 1985 United States–Canada tornado outbreak which killed 90 people. This record would not be surpassed until the 2011 Super Outbreak which killed 324 people. Damage from tornadoes was estimated at over $500 million (2008 USD).|$|E

On September 8, 1997, KELO installed two live <b>doppler</b> weather <b>radar</b> units in Huron and Beresford, becoming the first station in the country to operate two <b>doppler</b> <b>radars</b> simultaneously; a third radar, located in Wall, was installed in 2001. In 2007, KELO upgraded the Huron radar to use dual polarization technology and quadrupled its power to 1 million watts, it also upgraded the computer systems at the Beresford and Wall radar systems. In addition, KELO rebranded its radar network as [...] "KELOLand Live Doppler HD".|$|R
5|$|Both {{direct and}} {{indirect}} ways {{have been found to}} indicate the presence of a wake depression. The most direct is through the use of surface observations. Prior to the development of mesoscale weather station networks, or mesonets, it was difficult to locate wake lows. With the advent of mesoscale networks, wake lows have become easier to detect. On weather satellite and weather radar imagery, wake lows and heat bursts normally occur on the rear side of a precipitation area. However, within larger precipitation areas, they can be located within the area showing a minimum of returns. When using velocity data from a WSR-88D <b>doppler</b> <b>radar,</b> high winds on the back edge of reflectivity data can give away the location of a wake low.|$|E
5|$|In North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, {{rainfall}} {{was generally}} light, {{with the exception}} of a few areas receiving over 3inches (75mm). Henri produced greater amounts of rain in Delaware and Pennsylvania, with a peak of 9.02in (229mm) in Hockessin. In Downingtown, Pennsylvania, over eightinches (203mm) of rain fell in around sixhours, while <b>Doppler</b> <b>Radar</b> estimated that Kennett Square received over 10inches (255mm) in a five-hour period. The heavy rainfall led to record discharge rates along the Red Clay Creek, which also had a record crest peaking at just below 26feet (8m). Parts of the creek saw a 500-year flood, which has a 0.2% chance of occurring in any given year. Numerous rivers in southeastern Pennsylvania also crested above their flood stage.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} scales for rating the {{strength}} of tornadoes. The Fujita scale rates tornadoes by damage caused and has been replaced in some countries by the updated Enhanced Fujita Scale. An F0 or EF0 tornado, the weakest category, damages trees, but not substantial structures. An F5 or EF5 tornado, the strongest category, rips buildings off their foundations and can deform large skyscrapers. The similar TORRO scale ranges from a T0 for extremely weak tornadoes to T11 for the most powerful known tornadoes. <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> data, photogrammetry, and ground swirl patterns (cycloidal marks) may also be analyzed to determine intensity and assign a rating.|$|E

40|$|A <b>Doppler</b> weather <b>radar</b> is {{a device}} for weather {{observation}} that emits and receives signals while rotating its antenna to observe distribution {{of rain and}} wind in a wide area around it. It is thus considered the most suitable device for detecting gusts. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) has already deployed larger <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> nationwide. While those can observe a wide area, their spatial resolution is coarser at distances far away. Furthermore, they make observations higher in the atmosphere at greater distances. As they were not designed for railway use, larger radars are not entirely suitable for observing ground wind distribution that is important for railways. Smaller <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars,</b> while restricted in terms of observation area, are less expensive than larger ones and appropriate for focused observation of wind distribution in the lower atmosphere near railway lines...|$|R

5|$|The Sea Harrier FA2 {{featured}} the Blue Vixen radar, which {{was described as}} one of the most advanced pulse <b>doppler</b> <b>radar</b> systems in the world; the Blue Fox radar was seen by some critics as having comparatively low performance for what was available at the time of procurement. The Blue Vixen formed the basis for development of the Eurofighter Typhoon's CAPTOR radar. The Sea Harrier FA2 also carried the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, the first UK aircraft to be provided with this capability. An upgraded model of the Pegasus engine, the Pegasus Mk 106, was used in the Sea Harrier FA2; in response to the threat of radar-based anti aircraft weapons electronic countermeasures were added. Other improvements included an increase to the air-to-air weapons load, look-down radar, increased range, and improved cockpit displays.|$|E
5|$|The {{extremely}} {{short distance}} of the eyewall of Hurricane Danny from a <b>Doppler</b> <b>radar</b> station in Mobile, Alabama and its slow landfall {{over the course of}} a day led to further study by meteorologists. The proximity to land allowed for measurements at a level closer to the surface than it is possible for hurricane reconnaissance aircraft to achieve, with the slow landfall allowing for more extended observation. One conclusion of the study included the need to sample the boundaries of an eyewall more to establish a better estimate of surface-level winds and the overall intensity of a storm. Another conclusion was that while Danny's slow movement positioned it over a tidal estuary bordering the Gulf, maintaining of or increase in strength was possible since eyewall convection remained over waters with high sea surface temperatures and other environmental conditions remained favorable.|$|E

40|$|On June 29, 1981, two {{ground-based}} <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars,</b> an airborne <b>Doppler</b> optical <b>radar</b> (lidar), an instrumented tower, and a rawinsonde {{were employed}} to collect wind data in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) in central Oklahoma. The main objectives of this experiment were related to a comparison of wind estimates and the visualization of the three-dimensional eddy structure in the convective atmospheric boundary layer. Discrepancies in the mean wind and wind profile detected by the different sensing systems were explained as being caused by a Schuler resonance of the aircraft's inertial navigation system, which caused an erroneous component of the aircraft's ground-relative velocity vector to be subtracted from the lidar-measured radial velocities. It is concluded that NASA's airborne <b>Doppler</b> optical <b>radar</b> system is capable of measuring wind fields in clear air {{on a smaller scale}} than was previously available with fixed remote sensors...|$|R
40|$|The role of <b>Doppler</b> <b>radars</b> in {{forecasting}} {{the location}} and timing of the initiation of thunderstorms both over Kennedy Space Center and central Florida is analyzed.

Previous studies of thunderstorm initiation in the vicinity of Kennedy Space Center, including synoptic and site-specific observations are outlined. As a result of the analysis of nine cases of thunderstorm initiation, it is concluded that an expert system could be developed that would take input data from the existing field mill network, instrumented tower network, lightning detection system, from sounding, and from Doppler-radar-based algorithms. Such a system would be able to determine a probability of thunderstorm development in the next 10, 20, and 30 minutes for the area of interest...|$|R
