60|$|Entreating Herbert {{to tell me}} how he {{had come}} to my rescue,--which at first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my {{remaining}} quiet,--I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an hour's consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down. Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but, finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me. Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes. Among the loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's Boy,--true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business,--and Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham's in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb's boy became their guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous, left his guide and Startop {{on the edge of the}} quarry, and went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>when</b> suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries, and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.|$|E
60|$|In 1845, when I was {{ten years}} old, there was an {{epidemic}} of measles in the town and it made a most alarming slaughter among the little people. There was a funeral almost daily, and the mothers of the town were nearly demented with fright. My mother was greatly troubled. She worried over Pamela and Henry and me, and took constant and extraordinary pains {{to keep us from}} coming into contact with the contagion. But upon reflection I believed that her judgment was at fault. It seemed to me that I could improve upon it if left to my own devices. I cannot remember now whether I was frightened about the measles or not, but I clearly remember that I grew very tired of the suspense I suffered on account of being continually under the threat of death. I remember that I got so weary of it and so anxious to have the matter settled one way or the other, and promptly, that this anxiety spoiled my days and my nights. I had no pleasure in them. I made up my mind to end this suspense and be done with it. Will Bowen was dangerously ill with the measles and I thought I would go down there and catch them. I entered the house by the front way and slipped along through rooms and halls, keeping sharp watch against discovery, and at last I reached Will's bed-chamber {{in the rear of the}} house on the second floor and got into it uncaptured. But that was as far as my victory reached. His mother caught me there a moment later and snatched me out of the house and gave me a most competent scolding and drove me away. She was so scared that she could hardly get her words out, and her face was white. I saw that I must manage better next time, and I did. I hung about the lane at the rear of the house and watched through cracks in the fence until I was convinced that the conditions were favorable; then I slipped through the back yard and up the back way and got into the room and into the bed with Will Bowen without being observed. I don't know how long I was in the bed. I only remember that Will Bowen, as society, had no value for me, for he was too sick to even notice that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there.</b> <b>When</b> I heard his mother coming I covered up my head, but that device was a failure. It was dead summer-time--the cover was nothing more than a limp blanket or sheet, and anybody could see that there were two of us under it. It didn't remain two very long. Mrs. Bowen snatched me out of the bed and conducted me home herself, with a grip on my collar which she never loosened until she delivered me into my mother's hands along with her opinion of that kind of a boy.|$|E

6000|$|After {{that terrible}} vision they sailed seven {{days to the}} south, till Father Brendan saw a dense cloud; when they neared it, a form as of a man sitting, and before him a veil, {{as big as a}} sack, hanging between two iron tongs, and rocking on the waves like a boat in a whirlwind. Which when the brethren saw some thought was a bird, and some a boat; but the man of God bade them give over arguing, and row thither. And when they got near, the waves were still, {{as if they had been}} frozen; and they found a man sitting on a rough and shapeless rock, and the waves beating over his head; and when they fell back, the bare rock {{appeared}} on which that wretch was sitting. And the cloth which hung before him the wind moved, and beat him with it on the eyes and brow. But when the blessed man asked him who he was, and how he had earned that doom, he said, [...] "I am that most wretched Judas, who made the worst of all bargains. But I hold not this place for any merit of my own, but for the ineffable mercy of Christ. I expect no place of repentance: but for the indulgence and mercy of the Redeemer of the world, and for the honour of His holy resurrection, I have this refreshment; for it is the Lord's-day now, and as I sit here I seem to myself in a paradise of delight, by reason of the pains which will be mine this evening; for when I am in my pains I burn day and night like lead melted in a pot. But in the midst of that mountain which you saw, is Leviathan with his satellites, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>when</b> he swallowed your brother; and therefore the king of hell rejoiced, and sent forth huge flames, as he doth always when he devours the souls of the impious." [...] Then he told them how he had his refreshings there every Lord's-day from even to even, and from Christmas to Epiphany, and from Easter to Pentecost, and from the Purification of the Blessed Virgin to her Assumption: but the rest of his time he was tormented with Herod and Pilate, Annas and Caiaphas; and so adjured them to intercede for him with the Lord that he might be there at least till sunrise in the morn. To whom the man of God said, [...] "The will of the Lord be done. Thou shalt not be carried off by the daemons till to-morrow." [...] Then he asked him of that clothing, and he told how he had given it to a leper when he was the Lord's chamberlain; [...] "but because it was no more mine than it was the Lord's and the other brethren's, therefore it is of no comfort to me, but rather a hurt.

6000|$|In Salamis {{across the}} strait a trophy stood, and round that trophy, forty years before, Sophocles {{the author of}} Antigone, then sixteen years of age, the loveliest and most {{cultivated}} lad in Athens, undraped like a faun, with lyre in hand, was leading the Chorus of Athenian youths, and singing to Athené, the tutelary goddess, a hymn of triumph for a glorious victory,—the very symbol of Greece and Athens, springing up into a joyous second youth after invasion and desolation, as the grass springs up after the prairie fire has passed. But the fire had been terrible. It had burnt Athens at least, down to the very roots. True, while Sophocles was dancing, Xerxes, the great king of the East, foiled at Salamis, as his father Darius had been foiled at Marathon ten years before, was fleeing back to Persia, leaving his innumerable hosts of slaves and mercenaries to be destroyed piecemeal, by land at Platea, by sea at Mycalé. The bold hope was over, in which the Persian, ever {{since the days of}} Cyrus, had indulged—that he, the despot of the East, should be the despot of the West likewise. It seemed to them as possible, though not as easy, to subdue the Aryan Greek, as it had been to subdue the Semite and the Turanian, the Babylonian, and the Syrian; to rifle his temples, to destroy his idols, carry off his women and children as colonists into distant lands, as they had been doing with all the nations of the East. And they had succeeded with isolated colonies, isolated islands of Greeks, and the shores of Asia Minor. But when they dared, at last, to attack the Greek in his own sacred land of Hellas, they found they had bearded a lion in his den. Nay rather—as those old Greeks would have said—they had dared to attack Pallas Athené, the eldest daughter of Zeus—emblem of that serene and pure divine wisdom, of whom Solomon sang of old: ‘The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His way, before His works of old. When He prepared the heavens, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there,</b> <b>when</b> He appointed the foundation of the earth, then was I by Him, as one brought up with Him, and I was daily His delight, rejoicing always before him: rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth; and my delight was with the sons of men,’—to attack her and her brother Apollo, Lord of light, and beauty, and culture, and grace, and inspiration,—to attack them, not in the name of Ormuzd, nor of any other deity, but in the name of mere brute force and lust of conquest. The old Persian spirit was gone out of them. They were the symbols now of nothing save despotism and self-will, wealth and self-indulgence. They, once the children of Ormuzd or light, had become the children of Ahriman or darkness; and therefore it was, as I believe, that Xerxes’ 1,000 ships, and the two million (or, as some have it, five million) human beings availed naught against the little fleets and little battalions of men who believed with a living belief in Athené and Apollo, and therefore—ponder it well, for it is true—with a living belief, under whatsoever confusions and divisions of personality, in a God who loved, taught, inspired men, a just God who befriended the righteous cause, the cause of freedom and patriotism, a Deity, the echo of whose mind and will to man was the song of Athené on Olympus, when she ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tis {{strange to}} me, that they that love to tell Things done of old, yea, and that do excel Their equals in historiology, Speak not of Mansoul's wars, but let them lie Dead, like old fables, or such {{worthless}} things, That {{to the reader}} no advantage brings: When men, let them make what they will their own, Till they know this, are to themselves unknown. Of stories I well know there's divers sorts, Some foreign, some domestic; and reports Are thereof made, as fancy leads the writers; By books a man may guess at the inditers. Some will again of that which never was, Nor will be, feign, and that without a cause, Such matter, raise such mountains, tell such things Of men, of laws, of countries, and of kings: And in their story seem to be so sage, And with such gravity clothe ev'ry page, That though their frontispiece say all is vain, Yet to their way disciples they obtain[6] But, readers, I have somewhat else to do, Than with vain stories thus to trouble you; What here I say, some men do know so well, They can with tears and joy the story tell. The town of Mansoul is well known to many, Nor are her troubles doubted of by any That are acquainted with those histories That Mansoul, and her wars, anatomize. Then lend thine ear to what I do relate Touching the town of Mansoul and her state, How she was lost, took captive, made a slave; And how against him set, that should her save. Yea, how by hostile ways, she did oppose Her Lord, and with his enemy did close. For they are true; he that will them deny Must needs the best of records vilify. For my part, I (myself) was in the town, Both when 'twas set up, and when pulling down, I saw Diabolus in his possession, And Mansoul also under his oppression. Yea, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>when</b> she own'd him for Lord, And to him did submit with one accord. When Mansoul trampled upon things Divine, And wallowed in filth as doth a swine; When she betook herself unto her arms, Fought her Emmanuel, despis'd his charms, Then I was there, and did rejoice to see Diabolus and Mansoul so agree.[7] Let no men, then, count me a fable-maker, Nor make my name or credit a partaker Of their derision; what is here in view, Of mine own knowledge, I dare say is true. I saw the prince's armed men come down, By troops, by thousands, to besiege the town. I saw the captains, heard the trumpets sound, And how his forces cover'd all the ground. Yea, how they set themselves in battle-ray, I shall remember to my dying day. I saw the colours waving in the wind, And they within to mischief how combin'd, To ruin Mansoul, and to make away Her primum mobile[8] without delay. I saw the mounts cast up against the town, And how the slings were placed to beat it down. I heard the stones fly whizzing by mine ears, What longer kept in mind than got in fears, I heard them fall, and saw what work they made, And how old Mors did cover with his shade The face of Mansoul; and I heard her cry, Woe worth the day, in dying I shall die! I saw the battering rams, and how they play'd,[9] To beat ope Ear-gate, and I was afraid Not only Ear-gate, but the very town, Would by those battering rams be beaten down. I saw the fights, and heard the captains shout, And each in battle saw who faced about; I saw who wounded were, and who were slain; And who, when dead, would come to life again. I heard the cries of those that wounded were, While others fought like men bereft of fear, And while the cry, Kill, kill, was in mine ears, The gutters ran, not so with blood as tears. Indeed, the captains did not always fight, But then they would molest us day and night; Their cry, Up, fall on, let us take the town, Kept us from sleeping, or from lying down. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>when</b> the gates were broken ope, And saw how Mansoul then was stript of hope.[10] I saw the captains march into the town, How there they fought, and did their foes cut down. I heard the prince bid Boanerges go Up to the castle, and there seize his foe, And saw him and his fellows bring him down In chains of great contempt quite through the town. I saw Emmanuel when he possest His town of Mansoul, and how greatly blest A town, his gallant town of Mansoul was, When she received his pardon, lived his laws! When the Diabolonians were caught, When tried, and when to execution brought, Then I was there; yea, I was standing by When Mansoul did the rebels crucify. I also saw Mansoul clad all in white, And heard her prince call her his heart's delight. I saw him put upon her chains of gold, And rings, and bracelets, goodly to behold. What shall I say?--I heard the people's cries, And saw the prince wipe tears from Mansoul's eyes. I heard the groans, and saw the joy of many: Tell you of all, I neither will, nor can I. But by what here I say, you well may see That Mansoul's matchless wars no fables be. Mansoul! the desire of both princes was, One keep his gain would, t'other gain his loss; Diabolus would cry, The town is mine; Emmanuel would plead a right Divine Unto his Mansoul; then to blows they go, And Mansoul cries, These wars will me undo. Mansoul! her wars seem'd endless in her eyes, She's lost by one, becomes another's prize. And he again that lost her last would swear, Have her I will, or her in pieces tear. Mansoul, {{it was the very}} seat of war, Wherefore her troubles greater were by far, Than only where the noise of war is heard, Or where the shaking of a sword is fear'd, Or only where small skirmishes are fought, Or where the fancy fighteth with a thought. She saw the swords of fighting men made red, And heard the cries of those with them wounded; Must not her frights then be much more by far, Than theirs that to such doings strangers are? Or theirs that hear the beating of a drum, But not made fly for fear from house and home? Mansoul not only heard the trumpet sound, But saw her gallants gasping on the ground; Wherefore, we must not think that she could rest With them, whose greatest earnest is but jest: Or where the blust'ring threat'ning of great wars Do end in parleys, or in wording jars. Mansoul, her mighty wars, they did portend Her weal or woe, and that world without end; Wherefore she must be more concerned than they Whose fears begin and end the self-same day: Or where none other harm doth come to him That is engaged, but loss of life or limb,[11] As all must needs confess that now do dwell In Universe, and can this story tell. Count me not then with them that to amaze The people, set them on the stars to gaze, Insinuating with much confidence, That each of them is now the residence[12] Of some brave creatures; yea, a world they will Have in each star, though it be past their skill To make it manifest to any man, That reason hath, or tell his fingers can.[13] But I have too long held thee in the porch, And kept thee from the sunshine with a torch. Well, now go forward, step within the door, And there behold five hundred times much more Of all sorts of such inward rarities As please the mind will, and will feed the eyes With those, which if a Christian, thou wilt see Not small, but things of greatest moment be.

It lies there in the window,[14] fare thee well, My next may be to ring thy passing-bell.|$|E
