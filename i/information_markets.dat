In contrast, Shapiro and Varian (1999) point out that historical leaders in <b>information</b> <b>markets,</b> such as newspapers and encyclopedias are at risk of losing their positions as new technology greatly reduces the cost of creating and distributing information. They also indicate that <b>information</b> <b>markets</b> will not resemble textbook competitive markets with many suppliers offering similar products but lacking the ability to influence prices.|$|E

Information can be a complement irrespective of the financial market equilibrium coordinated upon and generates multiplicity in the <b>information</b> <b>market.</b> Multiplicity in the financial market exists irrespec-tive of the <b>information</b> <b>market</b> equilibrium and is generated as traders seek to profit from information about the payoffs and the supply of the asset. The multiplicity and complementarity provides insights and explanations for market frenzies and other phenomenon.

50|$|In {{describing}} {{the transition from}} traditional to <b>information</b> <b>markets,</b> Simard (2005) used a metaphor of autonomous providers and users exchanging information in place of sellers and buyers trading goods and services, respectively. Martin (1996) indicates that as manufacturing shifts from mass production to customization, marketing should shift to individualization. Similarly, Mcgee and Prusak (1993) state that with the increased capacity for customization, information about products and services will become an increasingly important resource.|$|E

50|$|From the {{perspective}} of knowledge markets, Mcgee and Prusak (1993) note that people barter for information, {{use it as an}} instrument of power, or trade it for information of greater value.

However, Shapiro and Varian (1999) indicate that <b>information</b> <b>markets</b> will not resemble textbook competitive markets with many suppliers offering similar products but lacking the ability to influence prices. Simard (2006) described knowledge markets as a group of related circular knowledge-service value chains that function collectively as a sector, to embed, advance, and extract value to yield sector outcomes and individual benefits.|$|E

With professor Geoffrey G Parker, he contributed to the founding literature on [...] "two-sided networks," [...] a refinement of network effects that explains how firms can profitably price information at zero. [...] Subsidized pricing and two-sided network effects can cause markets to concentrate in the hands of a few firms. These properties inform both firms’ strategies and antitrust law.|$|E

50|$|Information {{capital markets}} are {{commercial}} markets for the {{buying and selling}} of information and data. These markets connect data aggregators with organisations and individuals who need information for business, scientific or any other purposes. Regulating acts such as Data Protection Act 1998 and Data Protection Directive are imposed to control information capital market and prevent inappropriate usage of personal information by data aggregators or any other individuals and organizations. Although information has been bought and sold since ancient times, {{the idea of an}} information marketplace is relatively recent. The first Information market has formed around the Credit bureau type of organization for the exchange of personal information in the financial industry. But since that time Information market have changed radically. Nowadays <b>Information</b> <b>markets</b> are mainly hosted on electronic based data aggregation systems. Vast majority of them are accessible for both governments and organizations within corporate or any other sectors. Some information capital market platforms can be accessed directly by the public, for example SocialSafe Ltd which is social media backup tool that also allows users to download their content from a variety of social networks to their own personal data store and then sell this information directly.|$|E
