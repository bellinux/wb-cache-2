Firstly, referring to a hundred cotton logistics warehouse fires, based on the relevant provisions of the cotton logistics warehouse, and fire safety issues are summarized in this paper. Secondly, according to the physical and chemical characteristics of cotton, the fire risk of cotton logistics warehouse is analyzed, and the fire hazard sources are identified. Thirdly, Event and Fault Tree Analysis (EFTA) is used to explore the disaster mechanism of cotton logistics warehouses to obtain disaster reducing factors. In the end, based on the above analyses, a set of fire prevention measures against the cotton logistics warehouse are put forward. The result shows that the probability of moisture absorption and heat release is the highest of all causes of smoldering fire, so it is essential to control the temperature below 343 K and the humidity below 70 % when keeping in storage.
