40|$|<b>Gene</b> {{delivery}} and <b>therapy</b> in general The concept of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is a promising approach towards clinical treatment of pathological processes. The underlying principle of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is based on}} the introduction of genetic material into living cells in order to achieve a therapeutic biological effect [1]. Generally, this involves introducing DNA encoding a gene for a therapeutic protein. In somatic <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> the target cells {{are not part of the}} germ line and therefore the effects are restricted to the individual. In contrast, in <b>germ</b> line <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> the egg or sperm cells are manipulated and thus the potential future offspring of the individual are effected. For this reason, <b>germ</b> line <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> is not permitted under current legislation [2]. <b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> offers the potential of correcting the underlying cause of hereditary monogenetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) [3] and haemophilia B [4], for which the responsible gene is known. Therapeutic benefits of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> can be expanded to a wide range of diseases that are not strictly hereditary, such as cancer [5] and cardiovascular diseases [6]. In addition, applications of <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> can reach much further: introducing disease-modifying genes into already dysfunctional organs may alter the course of disease [7]. When an infectious agent is involved, <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> can be directed towards elimination of the agent from the organism or towards prevention of infection in the form of vaccination [8]. Recent developments indicate that besides delivery of dsDNA, other applications such as delivery of RNA sequences, RNAi, and RNA decoys that bind regulatory proteins [9] offers potential. For example, infectious agents such as HIV [10] and Hepatitis C virus [11] are targets for the development of RNAi for virus inhibition...|$|R
40|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>therapy</b> for {{individuals}} is mainly directed to somatic or germ cells. The present technology aims to insert a DNA segment in the recipient cells. This therapy {{is useful in}} Mendelian recessive diseases. There is an ethical moratorium to perform insertion <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> in <b>germ</b> cells, because this procedure increases the human genome. Somatic cell <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> cures individuals but increases the gene frequency of genetic diseases in the population. This occurs because {{the descendants of the}} cured patient should carry his or her «ill» genes. We denote by «DNA gene surgery» the procedure that replaces «ill» nucleotide(s) by healthy one(s) conserving the genome size and the gene context of expression and regulation. Several procedures for gene surgery have been applied to cells and animals. Those based on DNA repair as Chimeric RNA/DNA, one stranded oligonucleotides and tristranded DNA. Those based on DNA recombination with oligo-DNA or one stranded DNA, and transposable DNA segments. Gene surgery can be applied to <b>germ</b> cell <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> without ethical contraindications. It can cure Mendelian dominant diseases and it can be applied to heterozygotes. It preserves the regulation and expression gene context. If a technical safe procedure is available, the entire mankind could be treated and cured of all the Mendelian diseases, in one generation. Susceptibilities for all diseases could also be treated. The moratorium for research on <b>germ</b> cell <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> by <b>gene</b> surgery should be interrupted.

40|$|International audienceQuantitative and {{qualitative}} studies of {{various aspects of}} the perception of biotechnology were conducted among 469 Slovenian high school students of average age 17 years. Our research aimed to explore relationships among students' pre-knowledge of molecular- and human genetics, and their attitudes to four specific biotechnological applications. These applications - Bt corn, genetically modified salmon, somatic- and <b>germ</b> line <b>gene</b> <b>therapy</b> - were investigated from the viewpoints of usefulness, moral acceptance and risk perception. In addition, patterns and quality of moral reasoning related to the biotechnological applications from the aspect of moral acceptability were examined. Clear gender differences were found regarding the relationship between our students' pre-knowledge of genetics and their attitudes to biotechnological applications. While females with a better genetics background expressed a higher risk perception in the case of genetically modified salmon, their similarly well-educated male colleagues emphasized risk {{associated with the use of}} <b>germ</b> line <b>gene</b> <b>therapy.</b> With all four biotechnological applications, patterns of both rationalistic - deontological and teleological - and intuitive moral reasoning were identified. Students with poorer genetics pre-knowledge applied an intuitive pattern of moral reasoning more frequently than their peers with better pre-knowledge. A pattern of emotive reasoning was detected only in the case of genetically modified salmon.
