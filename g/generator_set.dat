5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> with a 10:1 reduction gearing. A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the B Station began {{shortly after}} the A station was completed. The {{stations}} were built during {{a period in which}} there were great advances in power station technology, and in the scale of production, which led to them having a variety of intermediate <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> sizes along with a mix of design styles. Blyth A had a generating capacity of 480megawatts (MW) and the B Station 1,250MW. Their combined capacity of 1,730MW briefly made Blyth Power Station the largest electricity generation site in England, until Ferrybridge C Power Station came into full operation in 1966. The stations were capable of generating enough electricity to power 300,000homes.|$|E

25|$|The Mk. I {{used two}} antennas, one for {{transmission}} {{and one for}} reception. Both were built on top of wooden huts, similar in construction to a travel trailer, that contained the respective electronics. The huts were mounted on large bearing plates that allowed the entire hut to rotate to track targets. These were, in turn, mounted on AA gun carriages for mobility. A <b>generator</b> <b>set</b> was placed between the two and provided power to both.|$|E
25|$|In late 1940 the Army {{was well}} into {{an effort to}} build an S-band GL radar system, and by 1942 had already sent the plans to {{companies}} in the UK for production. Work also began in Canada in 1940 on an entirely Canadian designed and built version with production starting in September 1942, and deliveries arriving in the UK starting in November 1942, as the GL Mk. IIIC, with British units arriving the next month as the Mk. IIIB. These were dramatically more mobile than the earlier Mk. I and Mk. II designs, consisting of two wheeled trailers and a <b>generator</b> <b>set.</b>|$|E
25|$|Their {{electrical}} system {{differed from the}} BR and NIR versions. The generator van contained two engine/generator sets, each supplying 220/380 V 50Hz AC to two separate electrical buses in the train. The air conditioning loads were divided in half, each half fed from a separate bus. In the case of failure of one <b>generator</b> <b>set,</b> the other set automatically supplies both buses. Air conditioning output power would then be halved, but all other loads including cooking, lighting and battery charging {{would continue to be}} supplied. This later remained the model for the electrical power supply on all subsequent IE coaches.|$|E

25|$|The new {{microwave}} sets began {{replacing the}} Mk. II during 1943, but deliveries were not particularly fast and these sets were often sent to new units {{as opposed to}} replacing Mk. II's in the field. The 1944 arrival of the US SCR-584 radar was the catalyst for the rapid replacement {{of all of these}} sets, as it combined scanning and tracking into a single unit with and internal <b>generator</b> <b>set.</b> In the immediate post-war era, these were in turn replaced by the smaller and lighter AA No. 3 Mk. 7 radar, which remained in use until AA guns were removed from service in the late 1950s.|$|E

The boiler house was [...] long by [...] wide and [...] high. It was built from a steel frame with aluminium cladding. The A station's design was an unusual mix of styles; the brick construction of the turbine hall was a style used more often in the 1950s, while the aluminium and glass cladding boiler house was a construction style used more in the 1960s. The A Station housed two control rooms, each of which served two generating sets and contained the controls to operate boilers, turbo generators and auxiliary plant. The A Station's switchgear was provided by A. Reyrolle & Company.|$|E

2500|$|By 1904 {{the area}} was {{recognised}} {{as a source of}} gravel and pits were established by 1907, especially on the east bank, and continue to produce aggregates and take in clean fill.

It had been started in October 1985 on a [...] sand pit (worked from about 1970 to 2000) and was replaced by Hampton Downs. It was closed earlier than originally planned, due to leachate problems. The 1999 consent required use of a vacuum to extract gas from the bores and leachate.
