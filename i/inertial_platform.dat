25|$|The Saturn V {{launch vehicle}} {{was guided by}} navigation, guidance, and control {{equipment}} located in the IU. A space stabilized platform (the ST-124-M3 <b>inertial</b> <b>platform</b> at location 21) measured acceleration and attitude. A launch vehicle digital computer (LVDC at location 19) solved guidance equations, and an analog flight control computer (location 16) issued commands to steer the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|As first {{explained}} by Maximilian Schuler in a 1923 paper, a pendulum whose period exactly equals the orbital {{period of a}} hypothetical satellite orbiting just above {{the surface of the}} earth (about 84 minutes) will tend to remain pointing at the center of the earth when its support is suddenly displaced. This principle, called Schuler tuning, is used in inertial guidance systems in ships and aircraft that operate on the surface of the Earth. No physical pendulum is used, but the control system that keeps the <b>inertial</b> <b>platform</b> containing the gyroscopes stable is modified so the device acts as though it is attached to such a pendulum, keeping the platform always facing down as the vehicle moves on the curved surface of the Earth.|$|E

25|$|In 1937 the Army, {{faced with}} the {{continuing}} supply problems with the Norden, once again turned to Sperry Gyroscope {{to see if they}} could come up with a solution. Their earlier models had all proved unreliable, but they had continued working with the designs throughout this period and had addressed many of the problems. By 1937, Orland Esval had introduced a new AC-powered electrical gyroscope that spun at 30,000 RPM, compared to the Norden's 7,200, which dramatically improved the performance of the <b>inertial</b> <b>platform.</b> The use of three-phase AC power and inductive pickup eliminated the carbon brushes, and further simplified the design. Carl Frische had developed a new system to automatically level the platform, eliminating the time-consuming process needed on the Norden. The two collaborated on a new design, adding a second gyro to handle heading changes, and named the result the Sperry S-1. Existing supplies of Nordens continued to be supplied to the USAAC's B-17s, while the S-1 equipped the B-24Es being sent to the 15th Air Force.|$|E

[...] With the HRS a navigator's heading unit (NHU) was provided which enabled the navigator plotter to adjust the aircraft heading, through the autopilot, by as little as 0.1 degrees. The B.2 (MRR) was additionally fitted with the LORAN C navigation system.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a new mechanical {{implementation of a}} monolithic inertial sensor and its application to {{the control of the}} top stage of a multi-stage mechanical suspension for seismic attenuation. In particular, we discuss the sensor theoretical model and the experimental results in connection with a new control strategy that {{can be applied to the}} control of mechanical suspensions (seismic attenuators), <b>inertial</b> <b>platforms</b> and low frequency monitoring and control of the mechanics of earth-based and space telescopes. The monolithic inertial sensor is a compact, light, fully scalable, tunable in frequency (1500 in air) instrument, with immunity to environmental noises guaranteed by an integrated laser optical readout. The measured sensitivity curve is in very good agreement with the theoretical one (10 − 12 m/sqrt(Hz)) in the band (0. 1 ÷ 10 Hz). Although its natural application is in the fields of earthquake engineering and geophysics, its performances make it suitable also for applications as sensor in the control of mechanical suspensions and <b>inertial</b> <b>platforms</b> of interferometric detectors of gravitational waves, where a residual horizontal motion better than 10 − 15 m/sqrt(Hz) in the band 0. 01 ÷ 100 Hz is a requirement, and in the control of the mechanics of ground-based or space telescopes...|$|R

A discrete Markov model is constructed from which this cost can be determined as a function of the decision thresholds employed to detect and identify the first and second failures. Optimal thresholds are determined through the use of parameter optimization techniques. The application of this approach to threshold determination is illustrated for the Space Shuttle's inertial measurement instruments...|$|R

In fact, beyond the obvious compactness and robustness of monolithic implementations of folded pendulum, the main advantages of this class of sensors are the tune-ability of the resonance frequency, the high sensitivity, due to integrated laser optical readout, in a large measurement band.

50|$|The Ariane 5 reused the {{inertial}} reference platform from the Ariane 4, but the Ariane 5's flight path differed considerably {{from the previous}} models. Specifically, the Ariane 5's greater horizontal acceleration caused the computers in both the back-up and primary platforms to crash and emit diagnostic data misinterpreted by the autopilot as spurious position and velocity data. Pre-flight tests had never been performed on the <b>inertial</b> <b>platform</b> under simulated Ariane 5 flight conditions so the error was not discovered before launch.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a new {{application of the}} monolithic folded pendulum configured as seismometer (no force feed-back) and used as sensor in the control of <b>inertial</b> <b>platforms</b> and suspensions, like, for example, those used in interferometric detectors of gravitational waves, where a residual horizontal motion better than 10 − 15 m/pHz in the band 0. 01 ÷ 100 Hz is a requirement. The experimental results, obtained in the band 0. 01 ÷ 10 Hz, demonstrate that this sensor has enough dynamics and sensitivity to introduce no limitations to the state-of-the-art control systems. Moreover, its full scalability allows an easy integration and positioning also on the different stages of multistage mechanical suspensions (seismic attenuators) and <b>inertial</b> <b>platforms.</b> This new application demonstrates not only the feasibility of the proposed new control strategy in the low frequency region, but, {{and it is very}} relevant, that it is now possible the implementation of very effective control systems with a large reduction of control electronics, replaced by less noisy optical and mechanical devices, with the further advantage of rendering the whole system surely less sensitive to environmental noises. The results of this study, although preliminary and obtained with sensors not optimized for the specific application, are presented and discussed in this paper, in connection with some of the possible applications (platforms and mechanical structure control and stabilization, building controls, etc.) and the planned further developments and improvements...|$|R
