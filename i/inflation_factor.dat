2500|$|The current Social Security formula used in {{calculating the}} benefit level (primary {{insurance}} amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone {{who worked in}} OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times <b>inflation</b> <b>factor</b> divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME. The progressive nature of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to also get a slightly higher Social Security Benefit percentage on this low average salary. Congress passed in 1983 the Windfall Elimination Provision to minimize Social Security benefits for these recipients. The basic provision {{is that the first}} salary bracket, $0–791/month (2013) has its normal benefit percentage of 90% reduced to 40–90%—see Social Security for the exact percentage. The reduction is limited to roughly 50% of what you would be eligible for if you had always worked under OASDI taxes. The 90% benefit percentage factor is not reduced if you have 30 or more years of [...] "substantial" [...] earnings.|$|E
40|$|We offer a novel {{methodology}} {{for assessing the}} quality of inflation reports. In contrast to the existing literature, which mostly evaluates the formal quality of these reports, we evaluate their economic content by comparing <b>inflation</b> <b>factors</b> reported by the central banks with ex-post model-identified factors. Regarding the former, we use verbal analysis and coding of in flation reports to describe <b>inflation</b> <b>factors</b> communicated by central banks in real time. Regarding the latter, we use reduced - form, new Keynesian models and revised data to approximate the true <b>inflation</b> <b>factors.</b> Positive correlations indicate that the r eported <b>inflation</b> <b>factors</b> were similar to the true, model-identified ones and hence mark high-quality inflation reports.

In this paper, several methods have been proposed to identify HLP in a financial accounting data set prior to conducting further analysis of regression and other multivariate analysis. The Pearson scorrelation coefficient and variance <b>inflation</b> <b>factors</b> (VIF) were used to measure the success of a detection method. Numerical analysis showed that common diagnostics like the twice-mean and thrice-mean rules failed to detect HLP in the given data set whilst robust approaches such as the potentials and diagnostic-robust generalized potentials (DRGP) methods were found to be successful in identifying high leverage point as indicated by lower values of the Pearson s correlation coefficient and variance <b>inflation</b> <b>factors...</b>|$|R

The insurance policy is a legal contract between the insurance carrier (insurance company) and the named insured(s).

Typically, claims due to floods or war (whose definition typically includes a nuclear explosion from any source) are excluded from coverage, amongst other standard exclusions (like termites). Special insurance can be purchased for these possibilities, including flood insurance.
