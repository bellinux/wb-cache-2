Yoshiko Okuyama of the University of Hawaii at Hilo found that Daigo's deft movements while playing the cello mirrored {{the high level of}} professionalism which he had reached. Several reviewers, such as Leigh Paatsch of the Herald Sun, questioned the need for the shot. Throughout the film's soundtrack, cello music remains dominant.

500|$|Mother India is the {{earliest}} {{example of a}} Hindi film containing Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra. An example is a coda during the scene in which Birju runs away from his mother and rejects her. It features a powerful symphonic orchestra with strings, woodwinds and trumpets. This orchestral music contains extensive chromaticism, diminished sevenths, and augmented scales. It also features violin tremolos. Anne Morcom writes in Hindi Film Songs and the Cinema that the piece is unmelodic and [...] "profoundly disturbing". This use of a western-style orchestra in Indian cinema influenced many later films, such as Mughal-e-Azam (1960), which features similar dissonant orchestral music to create atmosphere at tense moments. The song [...] "Holi Aayi Re Kanhai", sung by Shamshad Begum, has been cited as a typical Hindi film song which is written for and sung by a female singer, with an <b>emotional</b> <b>charge</b> that appeals to a mass audience.|$|E
500|$|Franz Liszt, a Hungarian composer, had {{attempted}} to write a Revolutionary Symphony as early as 1830; however, his focus for {{the early part of}} his adult life was mostly on his performing career. By 1847, Liszt was famous throughout Europe as a virtuoso pianist. [...] "Lisztomania" [...] swept across Europe, the <b>emotional</b> <b>charge</b> of his recitals making them [...] "more like séances than serious musical events", and the reaction of many of his listeners could be characterized as hysterical. Musicologist Alan Walker says, [...] "Liszt was a natural phenomenon, and people were swayed by him.... With his mesmeric personality and long mane of flowing hair, he created a striking stage presence. And there were many witnesses to testify that his playing did indeed raise the mood of an audience to a level of mystical ecstasy." [...] The demands of concert life [...] "reached exponential proportions" [...] and [...] "every public appearance led to demands for a dozen others." [...] Liszt desired to compose music, such as large-scale orchestral works, but lacked the time to do so as a travelling virtuoso. In September 1847, Liszt gave his last public recital as a paid artist and announced his retirement from the concert platform. He settled in Weimar, where he had been made its honorary music director in 1842, to work on his compositions.|$|E

[...] Griet and Vermeer's relationship, Hall wrote, lacked [...] "... the sense of two people breathing easily in one another's company." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, remarked that Girl with a Pearl Earring [...] "... brings off something that few dramas about artists do. It gets you to see the world through new– which is to say, old– eyes." [...] Gleiberman added that while Johansson is silent for most of the film, [...] "... the interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic." [...] In Sight & Sound, David Jays wrote that [...] "Johansson's marvellous performance builds on the complex innocence of her screen presence (Ghost World, Lost in Translation)." [...] Jays concluded his review by praising Webber and Serra's ability to [...] "... deftly deploy daylight, candle and shadow, denying our desire to see clearly just as Vermeer refuses to explicate the situations in his paintings. The film's scenarios may be unsurprising, but Webber's solemn evocation of art in a grey world gives his story an apt, unspoken gravity." ...|$|E

50|$|Huzzey was a fast wing with {{a strong}} scoring record, {{averaging}} around twenty tries a season. A popular player he worked well in partnership with Welsh rugby legend Gwyn Nicholls for both Cardiff and later for Wales. In 1900 at a general meeting for Cardiff Rugby Club, Nicholls and Huzzey {{were the only two}} names put forward for the position of captain for the next season. Nicholls had been the captain the previous two seasons, and Huzzey his vice, deputising well when Nicholls was absent. At the meeting Nicholls announced he was removing from contention to allow Huzzey the role, which caused the members to lobby Nicholls to change his mind in a very <b>emotional</b> <b>charged</b> situation. Nicholls did so and was re-elected. Huzzey felt betrayed by this move, as it was believed Huzzey would have otherwise been selected. Huzzey took umbrage and in September 'Went North', joining rugby league side Oldham RLFC.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{a survey of}} the English memory of the Second World War and Holocaust using oral interviews. Drawing from work by Halbwachs on collective memory and Grele on myth-making I demonstrate how people use national collective memory to provide frameworks for their individual narratives of memory or remembrance. I will also show how various influences from media and education have contributed to promoting and sustaining some of the myths associated with the British experience of the Second World War. However, by an empirical analysis of the data I also demonstrate how different groups within the nation, especially the family setting, have <b>emotional</b> <b>charged</b> memories that differ markedly from the national collective memory. Therefore, the study also notes remarkable divergences in the ‘public’ and ‘private’ representation of World War II and the Holocaust within England. I will illustrate how certain memories and representations have been marginalised as they are not useful to the overall social cohesion of the national community, which draws a level of security from the popular British war memory. Therefore this study adds a contribution to the discourse surrounding the memory of the Second World War and the Holocaust within England.

2500|$|After {{speculation}} {{of where}} the game would be played due to the California wildfires, it was confirmed on October 26, 2007 that Qualcomm Stadium would be discontinued as an evacuation site for San Diego residents (with most of the evacuees moved to Del Mar). Before, sites in the Phoenix area were being considered to host the game, as well as Houston's Reliant Stadium, and also the Dallas Cowboys' Texas Stadium. Before the game a special tribute was paid to at the stadium for the fire fighters, National Guard, and volunteers who assisted in fighting the fires and helping the evacuees. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger attended the game and flipped the coin, which the Chargers won. With an <b>emotional</b> <b>charge</b> from both the players and fans, {{as well as some}} victims, the Chargers played one of the best games of their season. Philip Rivers threw 3 touchdown passes despite only throwing 11 passes. Two TDs went to tight end Antonio Gates, and the remainder went to newly acquired wideout Chris Chambers, who was just traded from the Miami Dolphins a two weeks earlier and played his first game as a Charger (due to San Diego's bye week). However, that performance was second to second-year corner Antonio Cromartie, who performance included two interceptions, and two defensive touchdowns. He had a 70-yard INT return for a score, and the other was a complicated snap where the Texans snapped the ball over punter Matt Turk's head, and the ball fell into the end zone. Quickly having to recover, Turk missed grabbing the ball and it fell into the hands of Cromartie, easily scoring. The Chargers won, 35–10 in a home blowout, which was, in the quote of LaDainian Tomlinson, [...] "one for the fans." ...|$|E

Somatic diseases are everywhere recognized as conditioned by emotional problems among other factors. Often the researches explore the emotional patterns that are typical for a particular nosology. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify general emotional personality traits in adolescents with different chronic physical illnesses of visceral organs. Neuroticism, trait anxiety, emotional tension, mental instability, sensitivity, aggressive reactions have been studied using following techniques: EPQ, STAI, BDHI, "Accumulation of <b>emotional</b> <b>charges</b> aimed at himself " test, multivariate personality questionnaire "Psychodiagnostic test. " In contrast to healthy peers, chronically ill adolescents have higher levels of trait anxiety and mental imbalance, higher levels of neuroticism and irritability. Levels of emotional tension, indirect aggression, tendency to depression and sensitivity are slightly higher, the differences are minimal. We have observed much more extensive relations of neuroticism, psychoticism and irritability with other traits in adolescents with chronic physical illnesses. Correlations of emotional tension (as a habit to suppress emotions) are limited only by intrapersonal problems “psikhotizm”, hostility and guilt.
