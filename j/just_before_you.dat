It is an ending to the story that we started so long ago, but it's a very fast-paced ending to the story." [...] As a regard to the first 10 episodes of the season, executive producer Joseph Dougherty said that they [...] "are {{going to be like}} nothing that's ever happened before on this series. It's an incredible amount of information in every episode, but if we've done the job completely right, {{you should be able to}} figure the mystery out <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> find out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Because we can't help it. It's the doctor's orders. He thinks it's {{the best}} thing you can do, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go to bed." ...|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. As if {{something}} {{were going to}} happen. It came over me suddenly <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> proposed that we should run away to the others.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was {{one here}} <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> came {{who called himself}} though by another name than Norman of Torn. Possibly it is he ye seek." ...|$|E
60|$|We reached Sunbury Lock at half-past three. The {{river is}} sweetly pretty <b>just</b> there <b>before</b> <b>you</b> {{come to the}} gates, and the {{backwater}} is charming; but donâ€™t attempt to row up it.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{was at one}} time; but he {{lost the}} most of his fortune in stocks <b>just</b> <b>before</b> he died. <b>You</b> have hardly enough to keep you until you are twenty-one." ...|$|R
6000|$|Babbitt was up, hat in hand, growling, [...] "Well, if that's {{what you}} call being at peace, for heaven's sake <b>just</b> warn me <b>before</b> <b>you</b> go to war, will you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Hay Denver ran {{her fingers}} through his grizzled hair. [...] "It was when you came back in the Antelope, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> got your step." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I am {{pretty sure}} Ritter hit you, Jack," [...] came from Andy. [...] "Anyway, I saw him aiming for you <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> {{staggered}} and fell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's in this hotel. I {{noticed him}} sitting, half asleep, {{in the far}} corner of the lounge <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> came in. Do you want to see him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The game {{began at}} Sark," [...] said Marmaduke. [...] "Douglas {{stuck to her}} there like a leech. He's been about the house here a good deal since she came back. I often {{wondered}} you didnt kick him out. But, of course, {{it was not my}} business to say anything. Was she huffed into going? You hadnt any row with her <b>just</b> <b>before,</b> had <b>you?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|GILBEY. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> he let <b>you</b> in. A duke! Here has {{everything}} been respectable {{from the beginning}} of the world, as you may say, to the present day; and all of a sudden everything is turned upside down.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Miss Puss,--"but {{that was}} <b>just</b> <b>before</b> the holidays, <b>you</b> remember. And then the Colonel hurried {{her off to}} see her Pennsylvania relatives, and I believe they went to Annapolis, too, where the Carvels come from." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I don't {{know what}} it is," [...] replied Marcia tremulously. [...] "A man brought it <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> came in, and I didn't like to open it." ...|$|E
6000|$|PROSERPINE. Mad as a March hare. He did frighten me, I {{can tell}} you <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> came in that time. Haven't you noticed the queer things he says? ...|$|E
6000|$|Sir ANTHONY Worcestershire! no. Did {{you never}} meet Mrs. Malaprop and her niece, Miss Languish, {{who came into}} our country <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> were last ordered to your regiment? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He will. The {{shame of}} making a fool of himself <b>just</b> now <b>before</b> <b>you</b> {{will be more than}} he could bear. So be stingy for once. He will not wish for it unless you press him; but if he talks (and he will talk after the first half-hour), he will forget himself, and half a bottle will make him mad; and then I won't answer for the consequences." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And once more," [...] he went on, {{in a very}} insinuating voice. [...] "Shut {{your eyes}} again, and look back upon that day. Can't you {{remember}} whether or not, <b>just</b> a moment <b>before,</b> <b>you</b> saw the murderer's face {{by the light of}} the flashes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Wait <b>just</b> {{a moment}} <b>before</b> <b>you</b> finally decide. There is another rule. If you choose now, the order {{will be filled}} at once; but if you wait, {{you will have to}} await my pleasure. You cannot get a dish from that entire bill until I consent.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was saying}} {{practically}} that about {{you at the}} club <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> came in. My somewhat neat expression was that {{you were one of}} the gypsies of the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why yes, child. I {{sent him}} out to call you, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> came in. This Don Ippolito {{business}} put him quite out of my head. Didn't you see him? ... Oh! What's that?" ...|$|E

60|$|Your {{last letter}} is <b>just</b> received. <b>Before</b> <b>you</b> receive this it is {{probable}} Beverly Simpson will be in service if he comes in at all. If he does enlist, however, after you receive this tell him to ask to be assigned to a regiment now with the Army of the Potomac. If he is already in service have him write to me and I will assign him to some duty either with me or {{where it will be}} equally pleasant for him.|$|R
5000|$|The game is [...] "not supported" [...] with Windows 7, {{but does}} work. However, {{the game will}} crash during episode 6 <b>just</b> <b>before</b> the poker game, at 7PM. However, fans found a solution. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> the poker game, you have to sleep with your husband/neighbour. Doing so, around 6:55, causes a short cut scene that will force the game to go past 7PM, {{bypassing}} the crash. This strange bug can occur in other episodes, in which seducing someone <b>just</b> <b>before</b> will get <b>you</b> past it.|$|R
60|$|There are few {{creatures in}} the {{wilderness}} more difficult to observe than the beavers, both on account of their extreme shyness and because they work only by night. The {{best way to get}} a glimpse of them at work is to make a break in their dam and pull the top from one of their houses some autumn afternoon, at the time of full moon. <b>Just</b> <b>before</b> twilight <b>you</b> must steal back and hide some distance from the dam. Even then the chances are against you, for the beavers are suspicious, keen of ear and nose, and generally refuse to show themselves till after the moon sets or you have gone away. You may have to break their dam half a dozen times, and freeze as often, <b>before</b> <b>you</b> see it repaired.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Then, mamma, {{you must}} have told him yourself, and I don't think you knew till <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> were going. But, mamma, what does it matter? He has been here, and I have told him--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So they did. Why, <b>just</b> <b>before</b> <b>you</b> came in Amy said they'd {{never had}} a quarrel {{in the whole of}} their married life. You know Amy. There never was a better woman in the world." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have always}} {{read to me}} <b>before</b> <b>just</b> as <b>you</b> have written it. I think {{that you are not}} quite so nice to me, Arnold, as you were. I haven't done {{anything}} that you do not like, have I? Because I am sure that you are different!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Past {{experience}} {{leads me}} to be tolerably certain that, when the propositions I have <b>just</b> placed <b>before</b> <b>you</b> are accessible to public comment and criticism, they will be condemned by many zealous persons, and perhaps by some few of the wise and thoughtful. I should not wonder if [...] "gross and brutal materialism" [...] were the mildest phrase applied to them in certain quarters. And, most undoubtedly, {{the terms of the}} propositions are distinctly materialistic. Nevertheless two things are certain: the one, that I hold the statements to be substantially true; the other, that I, individually, am no materialist, but, on the contrary, believe materialism to involve grave philosophical error.|$|R
