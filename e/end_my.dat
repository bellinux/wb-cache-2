The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, where he had been elected king the year before. However, three months after his {{coronation}} at Wawel Cathedral, Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: [...] "I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the <b>end...</b> <b>My</b> only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you." ...|$|E

On making the team, Swanigan said, [...] "I always set goals for myself. I set goals for this spring. One of my goals is to make this team to <b>end</b> <b>my</b> high school career." [...] To prepare for the games, Swanigan played in the Nike Hoop Summit, McDonald's All American Game, and the Jordan Brand Classic. Swanigan did not take part in the Indiana-Kentucky All Star Game so he could attend the U19 training camp. He was one of five player's returning from the gold medal winning U17 squad. Swanigan's teammate Vince Edwards was also in the running to make the team, but was cut at the round of 16. The team finished 7–0, and Swanigan averaged 6.1 points and 4.4 rebounds per game.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{made his}} first {{official}} visit to the nation's new seat of government in early June 1800. Amid the [...] "raw and unfinished" [...] cityscape, the president found the public buildings [...] "in a much greater forwardness of completion than expected." [...] He moved into the nearly completed President's Mansion (later known as the White House) on November 1. Abigail arrived a few weeks later. Upon arriving, Adams wrote to her, [...] "Before I <b>end</b> <b>my</b> letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof." [...] The Senate of the Sixth Congress {{met for the first}} time in the new Congress House (later known as the Capitol building) on November 17, 1800. Several days later, on November 22, Adams delivered his fourth State of the Union Address to a joint session of Congress in the Senate chamber. This would be the last annual message any president would personally deliver to Congress for the next 113 years.|$|E
500|$|The {{adaptation}} received mostly negative {{reviews from}} the press, believing {{it did not}} match up to Hitchcock's 1935 film version (as predicted by Mickery). Sam Wollaston of The Guardian felt that the romance scene between Hannay and Victoria (when they stay overnight in an inn) was [...] "one of the silliest ever" [...] and felt that after the final scene at the loch and the concluding scene: [...] "It's all very silly.... It doesn't have the pace, the moodiness or the wit." [...] Damien Love of Sunday Herald felt the [...] "tepid pace" [...] was set by the casting of Penry-Jones, and that he [...] "has a style reminiscent of the young Roger Moore, but without the vital, animating spark of self-deprecation. As Hannay, Penry-Jones is not at his best, and more reminiscent of a well-stuffed armchair on wheels." [...] Mick Hume of The Times said [...] "The overall effect was to turn Buchan's blood and thunder tale into a pallid politically correct Enid Blyton story", and The Independents Robert Hanks concluded his review by saying that [...] "By the <b>end,</b> <b>my</b> impression was that several pages of the plot must have been eaten by a dog, or a bored actor, and the director had decided, sod it, nobody's going to keep watching this long. Which I wouldn't have if I wasn't being paid." ...|$|E

500|$|Warwick {{arrived at}} Le Havre in late October 1562. He was sceptical {{from the start}} as to the chances to hold Le Havre, writing: [...] "I fear [...] are too much abused in the good opinion {{you have in the}} {{strength}} of this town". Elizabeth soon made it clear that she did not wish his army to engage in any active support for the Huguenot side, the purpose of the English contribution remaining somewhat obscure. In March 1563 the warring French agreed to a peace, while Elizabeth decided to hold on to Le Havre until Calais was returned to the English, as had been agreed with the Huguenot party. The reconciled French, however, turned jointly against the English garrison. Le Havre's fortifications would have needed major expansion and repair to withstand a prolonged siege. Still, Dudley tried his best until the town's walls were crumbling under French bombardment and the Queen permitted him to surrender honourably in July 1563 on account of the plague that was decimating his troops. Ambrose Dudley himself {{had been shot in the}} leg when parleying with the French and returned to England seriously ill. He wrote to his brother that he was happy [...] "rather to <b>end</b> <b>my</b> life upon the breach than in any sickness. ... Farewell my dear and loving brother, a thousand times." [...] Robert Dudley went to welcome him at Portsmouth despite the plague and much to Elizabeth's annoyance.|$|E
500|$|McBreen held {{talks with}} A-League team Adelaide United before being handed a trial with their divisional rivals Wellington Phoenix. He {{returned}} to former club York City on 25 June 2008 on a one-year contract. His first match {{back at the}} club was a 1–0 away victory over Crawley Town and in his third appearance he scored his first goal of the 2008–09 season with a left-footed shot from 17yards in a 1–1 home draw with Histon. McBreen was played primarily as a lone striker in away matches during 2008–09, a decision which York manager Colin Walker defended in September 2008; Dave Flett of The Press commented that he [...] " [...] the line lazily". During February 2009, it {{was reported in the}} Australian media that he had agreed join A-League newcomers North Queensland Fury, although York were unaware of any transfer taking place. It was later confirmed that he would join the Fury in August 2009 for the 2009–10 A-League, following the expiry of his York contract in June. He had scored in every round of the 2008–09 FA Trophy leading up to the final, bar the first round when he was an unused substitute, and ahead of the final commented that: [...] "I couldn't ask for anything more than a Wembley final to <b>end</b> <b>my</b> career in Europe and it's also a great finale to a disappointing season for the fans and players". He started in the match at Wembley Stadium on 9 May 2009, which York lost 2–0 to Stevenage Borough. He made 48 appearances and scored 10 goals with York finishing in 17th place in the 2008–09 Conference Premier table.|$|E

[...] Campese was selected for the Australian team for the first eight Tests of their 1996 season, before being dropped following his 100th Test against Italy.
