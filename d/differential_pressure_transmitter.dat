40|$|A very simple, {{low-cost}} gas-liquid {{flow meter}} that only employs conventional field instrumentation {{has been used}} to monitor severe slugging occurring at the exit of a vertical pipe. This meter has been originally developed for conventional oil field application [1] and is based on the readings of a multiphase orifice and the pressure drops of the gas-liquid mixture flowing in a vertical section of the pipe. Liquid and gas flow rates have been determined by means of semi-empirical equations developed for the specific set of flow parameters (geometry, flow rates, physical properties) adopted in a series of laboratory tests conducted in the Multiphase Flow Laboratory of TEA Sistemi. The transient behavior of the flow system, including the orifice, has also been predicted by means of a 1 -D flow simulator [2]. The results of these simulations agree quite well with the experimental readings, thus providing a powerful method to monitor severe slugging by means of low cost instrumentation, in particular, by replacing a cumbersome instrument such as a -densitometer with a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter.</b> In field operation, the multiphase orifice used in these experiments can be replaced by a calibrated control valve...|$|E
40|$|Abstract − The {{measurement}} of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is widely employed in the petrol industry for determining the flow rate, level, blockage of filters and the oil-water interface. The calibration of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> is usually made at atmospheric pressure, since there is little concern about the static pressure influence on the transducer performance. As a main contribution, this paper presents a calibration methodology of <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The ranges of the studied static pressure (from 0 to 20000 kPa) and <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> (from 40 to 250 kPa) cover Petrobras production and exploration operating conditions. To achieve the results, a pressure amplification device was developed and used at each port of the <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter.</b> Thus, during the calibration of a <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter,</b> the <b>pressure</b> <b>differential</b> at the <b>transmitter</b> ports is deduced from the measured value at nearly atmospheric pressure and the amplification factor.

40|$|The thermal {{performance}} of flat-plate solar collectors with riser and header arrangements is {{strongly influenced by}} the flow distribution through the absorber tubes. A more uniform flow distribution leads to a homogenous temperature distribution which gives higher collector efficiency. The Z distribution usually has better performance when compared to P distribution. The design of the manifold influences the observed flow distribution. To optimize the manifold design, a correlation model was developed, based on correlations for minor pressure losses. Furthermore, the flow in this optimized geometry was simulated in 3 D using the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software code in order to confirm {{the results of the}} correlation based model. A new experimental low-intrusive technique was used to measure the flow distribution in an existing solar collector, validating the simulation results.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} amount of {{purchased}} fuels, more and more plants are making use of in-plant generated sources of gases. The availability of such waste gases is usually not constant, thus the total plant's mixed gas heating value swings accordingly. When this mixed gas is fed to the furnaces or boilers that are on strictly volumetric flow control loops, it causes large upsets in the heat release rate, even at a constant flow. These upsets, in turn, cause changes in process temperatures and/or pressures, resulting in off specification products and air pollution violations, and may even cause damage to equipment. The tendency is to operate routinely at a high excess air level, resulting in a much lower overall efficiency, or to even flare the gas. For many fuel gases, the heating value per standard unit volume varies linearly with the mass per standard unit volume. Perhaps a lesser realized fact it that the air required for combustion of 1000 Btu (net) heat release is almost independent of fuel molecular weight. This paper will describe the details of a technique developed by the Foxboro Company to measure the incoming fuel gas total Btu content by using a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter</b> and vortex flowmeter in series, generate a feed forward signal to maximize overall efficiency through transients, and to do it without compromising any of the safety constraints of the furnace...|$|E

To understand the flow behavior of two phase CO 2 stream with N 2 impurity, experimental investigations should be carried out and compared with existing correlation {{to figure out the}} accuracy of correlations. In this study we designed and installed an experimental facility to simulate the two phase flow behavior of CO 2 -N 2 mixture during the pipeline transportation.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Process {{industries}} today enjoy significant {{benefits from}} advances {{made in the}} field of simulation as well as technologies that model normal plant operation. Plants however continue to suffer during abnormal operation such as start-up, shutdown and equipment failures leading to production losses or personal injury. One of the key elements that determines the operational safety of any plant is the training and technical knowledge of its personnel regarding plant behaviour. Simulators {{play a vital role in}} training personnel, preparing them for normal plant operation, abnormal plant operation as well as emergency and accident situations. This would not only enhance plant safety, but also decrease total downtime. In order to create such a simulator, mathematical models are required for each of the numerous components within the plant. This dissertation focuses on the development of a mathematical model for a control valve; a component commonly found in various industries to control and manipulate processes. Different modelling methods are compared, taking into account applicable modelling criteria such as training data, algorithm complexity, oscillations near endpoints, degree of system integration and model limitations. Based on these criteria, fuzzy logic with the nearest neighbourhood clustering algorithm is chosen as an appropriate modelling technique especially due to its ability to deal with large quantities of data. In order to meaningfully train the fuzzy logic system (FLS), a comprehensive set of physical operational data is required, covering all the different operational characteristics. To capture physical data, the development of a data acquisition (DAQ) system is introduced using two common DAQ systems to create a hybrid solution. Transducer signals are converted tom mA to V, using custom developed signal conversion hardware. This will allow data to be sampled by a standard DAQ card and processed by accompanying software. Two post- processing software applications are created. The first application solves the governing equations (mass rate of flow, Reynolds number, expansibility factor and choke status) and the second application is used to graphically display the acquired and calculated data. A set of experiments are conducted, covering all relevant working areas, to capture the behaviour of the control valve. This is achieved using five initial pressures ranging from 200 kPa to 400 kPa in increments of 50 kPa. At each initial pressure a set of unit step responses with valve command signals ranging from 0 % to 100 % in increments of 5 % is acquired. 24 data files at each initial pressure set (200, 250, 300, 350 and 400 kPa) are acquired. Before training the FLS, the optimal fuzzy logic parameters need to be determined e. g. radius (r), sigma (σ) the number of time delays, the time delay increments and the impact of the input signals. Determining these parameters is an iterative process. Only a single data set, with initial pressure of 300 kPa, is used to derive the optimal fuzzy logic parameters. Four performance criteria namely maximum error average (MEA), mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation of the error residuals (CVRE) are used as benchmarks to obtain the optimal fuzzy parameters. During both the search for the optimal fuzzy parameters and the training of the fuzzy models using these optimal fuzzy parameters, 70 % of the data are used for training and verification while the remaining 30 % of the data are used for validation. Once the optimal fuzzy parameters are obtained using only the single data set, it is used to derive a number of fuzzy control valve models based on all the available data sets. All derived fuzzy models use the same parameters, except for a unique random file sequence associated with each of the models. The only prerequisite for the fuzzy models is that the generated file sequence be truly random. Irrespective of the random file sequence, fuzzy models with the same parameters, produce models with more or less the same performance. Therefore the performance criteria (MEA, MSE, RMSE and CVRE), for each data file, in the respective initial pressure sets, remains more or less the same. This method is found to be very useful in deriving a dynamic fuzzy logic control valve model. Averaging the performance criteria of these five models, an overall modelling accuracy of 90 % is achieved. It is recommended that a flow meter be installed to measure the mass rate of flow through the pipe network. This eliminates the need for an orifice, differential pressure transducer and the use of the first principle governing equation for the mass rate of flow. If a flow meter cannot be installed, a <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter</b> with large range should be considered accompanied by a single orifice. Master...|$|E

Utfordringa ligg i å senke kostnadar til installasjon og drift av grunnvarme-systemer, auke det bærekraftige uttaket av energi frå kvart borhol og utvikle teknologi for å ta i bruk grunnvarme på nye områder. Det er difor utvikla eit forskningsprosjekt ved Mære landbruksskole i Nord-Trøndelag dereit dynamisk system skal utviklast og testast for å benytte seg av solvarme frå eit veksthus om sommaren, energibrønner og eit korttids varmelager. Som ein del av forskningsprosjektet på Mære er det i masteroppgåva fokusert på å undersøke geologiske parametre nødvendig for dimensjonering av brønnparken. I tillegg har innstallering av to ulike typer kollektorslanger i ein testbrønn, ein vanleg og ein turbo kollektor, gjortdet muleg å undersøke ulikheitar mellom desse i samme brønn. Turbo kollektoren er dyrare enn ein {{standard}} kollektor, men riller på innsiden skal gje større varmeoverføring og mindre trykktap. Ein differensial trykkmålar innstallert på termisk responstest hengaren kombinertmed vibrasjonsmålarar festa direkte på kollektoren gjorde det muleg å undersøke trykktapog vibrasjonar for kollektorane ved ulike strømningshastigheiter. Turbulent strømning gjer betre varmeoverføring men krev ein høgare strømningshastigheit og dermed større trykktap,og difor er det interessant å undersøke overgongen mellom laminær og turbulent strømning. Det vart påvist lite grunnvannstrømning i området, men sprekker i og rundt området avbrønnparken tyder på at det kan skape utfordringar ved boring. Utfallet av ein termisk responstest under ein langvaring kuldeperiode viste at det ikkje er gunstig å gjennomføre tester i kuldeperioder utan å kontrollere med temperaturloggarar plassert i brønnen undertesten. Resultatet frå felttesten viste ein termisk konduktivitet på 4. 0 W/(m · K), menslaboratorieforsøk med kjerneprøver tatt i området viste verdier på 3. 0 W/(m · K). Den termiskekonduktiviten var 25 % høgare målt parallelt med foalisjonen enn normalt på, mestsannsynleg på grunn av kvartsårer. Boreholsmotstanden var lik for begge kollektorer, ogkalkulert som 0, 07 (K · m) /W. Simulering viser at ein brønnpark med desse eigenskapaneer stabil over lang tid. I tillegg viser simulering at det ikkje er tilrådeleg økonomisk å kunbruke generiske verdier ved dimensjonering av anlegg, men supplere med laboratorieforsøkeller termisk responstester. Ved Reynolds tal over 10 000 har dei to kollektorane sametrykktap. Derimot viser lågare Reynolds-tal noko overraskande at standard kollektoren harlågare trykktap enn turbo kollektoren, noko som betyr at den har lågare friksjonfaktor ogat pumpa bruker mindre energi. Tala for turbo kollektoren er unormalt høge, og det det erdifor ikkje muleg å konkludere med kva for kollektor som viser dei beste eigenskapane. Vibrasjonsanalysaviser ikkje noko eintydig overgong mellom laminær og turbulent strømning. Det er anbefalt å gjennomføre fleire tester på trykktap i felt med Reynolds tall under 10000 for å verifisere eller avkrefte resultatane som viser at standard kollektoren har lågare trykktap enn turbo kollektoren. Vidare vil det vere av interesse å visualisere strømningar iein gjennomsiktig slange med same eigenskapar som turbo kollektoren. Vibrasjonsmålingarbør gjennomførast på nytt basert på erfaringar frå denne oppgåva. Using {{the ground}} as a heat source or sink may significantly reduce CO 2 emissions in the atmosphere {{while at the same}} time leading to economic gain. However, the technology must be made more competitive by cost reduction, sustainable use and expansion of technology for new applications. Thus, a project at Mære Landbruksskole in Nord-Trøndelag, Norway,has been initiated to develop and test a dynamic system for using heat from the sun through a greenhouse during summer, energy wells and short-term storage of heat. As a part of the research-project at Mære, this master’s thesis focuses on investigating the geological parameters necessary to design the borehole thermal energy storage (BTES). The installation of two different borehole heat exchangers in a test-well, a standard and a turbo collector, made it possible to examine the differences between these in the same well. The turbo collector is more expensive than the standard collector, but micro fins on the inside gives a better heat transfer and lower pressure drop. A <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitter</b> installed on the test equipment in combination with a vibration indicator set directly on the collector, allowed an investigation of the pressure drop and vibrations for the collectors at different flow velocities. Turbulent flow gives a higher heat transfer but requires a higher flow velocity and thus a higher pressure drop. It is therefore of great interest to investigate the transition between laminar and turbulent flow. The presence of groundwater flow was not found to be significant, but fractures in and around the field site might create challenges in drilling operations. The duration of a thermal response test in a cold period showed that it is not favorable to carry out field tests in cold periods without controlling the measurements by placing temperature loggers in the well during the test. Results from the field test revealed a thermal conductivity of 4. 0 W/(m · K), while laboratory tests using core samples showed values of 3. 0 W/(m · K). Thethermal conductivity was 25 % higher for measurements parallel to the foliation comparedwith normal oriented, most likely because of quartz ores. The borehole thermal resistancewas similar for both collectors, and calculated as 0. 07 (K · m) /W. Simulations show that a BTES with these properties is stable over time. Simulations also show that it is notadvisable for economic reasons to only use generic value when dimensioning a system of thissize, but necessary to supply with laboratory tests or thermal response tests. At Reynoldsnumbers above 10 000, both collectors have the same pressure drop. Quite surprisingly,lower Reynolds numbers show that the standard collector have a lower pressure drop thanthat of the turbo collector, thus having a lower friction factor and less need for energy from the pump. The values for the turbo collector are abnormally high, and no conclusion as to which collector is a better choice can be reached. The vibration analysis does not portray a definite transition between laminar and turbulent flow. Further experiments regarding pressure drop should be performed with Reynolds numberless than 10 000 to verify or undermine the results which show a lower pressure drop for the standard collector than the turbo collector. A visualization of flow through a transparent pipe with similar features as the turbo collector would be of great interest. It is also recommended to perform new vibration measurements with the experiments from this thesis in mind. </p...|$|E

Because of these capabilities, bypass {{pneumatic conveying}} systems have been used in coal-fired power stations for removing fly ash {{for the last couple of}} decades. In bypass systems, the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> between bypass pipe and main pipe as well as the pipeline pressure drop are two of most significant parameters as <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> represents the aeration mechanism within the pipeline while pressure drop is an essential parameter for bypass pneumatic conveying system design. In bypass systems, these two parameters are determined not only by the turbulent mode of the gas solids two-phase flow but also by the bypass configurations. The objective of this study was to experimentally investigate the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> between bypass pipe and main pipe as well as the pressure drop during the bypass pneumatic conveying of fly ash. Pneumatic conveying tests in bypass systems and a conventional pipeline were carried out in this study. The bypass pipeline was a 79 mm diameter main pipe with a 27 mm inner diameter bypass pipe with orifice plate flute arrangement. Fly ash was discharged to the system from the bottom of a positive pressure blow tank. The receiving bin was mounted on load cells for measuring the mass accumulation.

Therefore, air came into main pipe and aerated the material continuously.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of the simultaneous flow of oil and water in horizontal pipes. In this connection, two test facilities are used. Both facilities have horizontal test sections with inner pipe diameters equal to 2 inches. The largest facility, called the model oil facility, has reservoirs of 1 m 3 of each medium enabling flow rates as high as 30 m 3 /h, which corresponds to mixture velocities as high as 3. 35 m/s. The flow rates of oil and water can be varied individually producing different flow patterns according to variations in mixture velocity and input water cut. Two main classes of flows are seen, stratified and dispersed. In this facility, the main {{focus has been on}} stratified flows. Pressure drops and local phase fractions are measured for a large number of flow conditions. Among the instruments used are <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> and a traversing gamma densitometer, respectively. The flow patterns that appear are classified in flow pattern maps as functions of either mixture velocity and water cut or superficial velocities. From these experiments a smaller number of stratified flows are selected for studies of velocity and turbulence. A laser Doppler anemometer (LDA) is applied for these measurements in a transparent part of the test section. To be able to produce accurate measurements a partial refractive index matching procedure is used. The other facility, called the matched refractive index facility, has a 0. 2 m 3 reservoir enabling mainly dispersed flows. Mixture velocities range from 0. 75 m/s to 3 m/s. The fluids in this facility are carefully selected to match the refractive index of the transparent part of the test section.

The {{purpose of}} this article is to measure fluid {{pressure}} drops against the changing velocity on the critical points of the fluid system by using mechatronics equipments and techniques. Critical points of the fluid system to be measured pressure drops are gate valve, globe valve, flow control valve, sudden enlargement, 45 ° or 90 ° junctions etc. Pressure drops occurs mentioned areas much more than other parts of fluid system. Pressure drop is directly concerning with flow rate of fluid. It was used venture-meter and orifice-plate to measure flow rate and fluid velocity in pipe. <b>Pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> were used to measure pressure drops on the critical points of fluid system in according to changing flow rate of fluid. <b>Pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> produce analog signals between 4 - 20 mA in according to changing pressure of fluid in pipe and analog input signals are interpreted through an A/D device, and is originate from pressure sensors. All the received data from <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> are transferred to computer via A/D cards. Received data from <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitters</b> is evaluated by using developed program to measure fluid friction losses with changing pressure differences and flow rate, velocity of fluid, Reynolds number, fluid type and some values can be seen on the screen of computer in real time...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{consists}} of two parts. In the first part a numerical model describing the thermo hydraulic behavior of district heating (DH) networks {{has been used to}} investigate the pressure and temperature profile within a solar assisted system. The network description is based on a graph-theoretical method and the Newton algorithm was used for solving the system of nonlinear equations. A direct integration without heat storage is implemented here for an existing network topology in South Germany. The simulation shows that critical <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> driven operation of the district pump is not realizable with a reasonable number of <b>pressure</b> <b>transmitters.</b> The volume flow driven control provides more stability but has to be optimized by means of pressure measurements. The second part of the paper presents the new test facility built for decentralized solar heat integration. It also gives an overview about the design topics that will be investigated during the next test period: component suitability for bidirectional heat exchange, station control, net metering and handling both solar and load sides...|$|R
