When this compound is combined with vancomycin, minocycline, and rifampicin, the rates of inhibition increased, indicating a partially synergistic effect with anti-MRSA antibiotics (Sato et al.).

[...] Additional studies, done in South Korea in 2009 and Romania in 2010, support these findings of partially synergistic effects between sophoraflavanone G and various antibiotics, adding that when used either alone, or in conjunction with ampicillin and oxacillin (Cha et al.), and ampicillin, <b>gentamycin,</b> minocycline, vancomycin, and hydrochloride (Duka et al.), sophoraflavanone G increases the number of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (MRSA & VRE) killed within plated colonies (based on FIC indices).|$|E

5000|$|There is no readily {{available}} {{evidence on the}} route of administration and duration of antibiotics in patients with pleural empyema. Experts agree that all patients should be hospitalized and treated with antibiotics intravenously. [...] The specific antimicrobial agent should be chosen based on Gram stain and culture, or on local epidemiologic data when these are not available. Anaerobic coverage must be included in all adults, and in children if aspiration is likely. Good pleural fluid and empyema penetration {{has been reported in}} adults for penicillins, ceftriaxone, metronidazole, clindamycin, vancomycin, <b>gentamycin</b> and ciprofloxacin. Aminoglycosides should typically be avoided as they have poor penetration into the pleural space. There is no clear consensus on duration of intravenous and oral therapy. Switching to oral antibiotics can be considered upon clinical and objective improvement (adequate drainage and removal of chest tube, declining CRP, temperature normalization). Oral antibiotic treatment should then be continued for another 1-4 weeks, again based on clinical, biochemical and radiological response.|$|E
50|$|Biosynthesis i.e. the {{conversion}} of organic materials into fine chemicals by microorganisms, {{is used for the}} production of both small molecules (using enzymes in whole cell systems) and less complex, non-glycosylated big molecules, including peptides and simpler proteins. The technology has been used for 10,000 years to produce food products, like alcoholic beverages, cheese, yogurt, and vinegar. In contrast to biocatalysis, a biosynthetic process does not depend on chemicals as starting materials, but only on cheap natural feedstock, such as glucose, to serve as nutrient for the cells. The enzyme systems triggered in the particular microorganism strain lead to the excretion of the desired product into the medium, or, in the case of HMW peptides and proteins, to the accumulation within so-called inclusion bodies in the cells. The key elements of fermentation development are strain selection and optimization, as well as media and process development. Dedicated plants are used for large-scale industrial production. As the volume productivity is low, the bioreactors, called fermenters, are large, with volumes that can exceed 250 m3. Product isolation was previously based on large-volume extraction of the medium containing the product. Modern isolation and membrane technologies, like reverse osmosis, ultra- and nano-filtration, or affinity chromatography can help to remove salts and by-products, and to concentrate the solution efficiently and in an environmentally friendly manner under mild conditions. The final purification is often achieved by conventional chemical crystallization processes. In contrast to the isolation of small molecules, the isolation and purification of microbial proteins is tedious and often involves a number of expensive large-scale chromatographic operations.Examples of large-volume LMW products made by modern industrial microbial biosynthetic processes are monosodium glutamate (MSG), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), and vitamin C (ascorbic acid). In vitamin B2, riboflavin, the original six- to eight-step synthetic process starting from barbituric acid has been substituted completely by a microbial one-step process, allowing a 95% waste reduction and an approximately 50% manufacturing cost reduction. In ascorbic acid, the five-step process (yield ≈ 85%) starting from D-glucose, originally invented by Tadeus Reichstein in 1933, is being gradually substituted by a more straightforward fermentative process with 2-ketogluconic acid as pivotal intermediate. After the discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming from colonies of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, it took more than a decade before a powdery form of the medicine was developed. Since then, many more antibiotics and other secondary metabolites have been isolated and manufactured by microbial fermentation on a large scale. Some important antibiotics besides penicillin are cephalosporins, azythromycin, bacitracin, <b>gentamycin,</b> rifamycin, streptomycin, tetracycline, and vancomycin.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aims: Motility is {{a feature}} of many {{pathogens}} {{that contributes to the}} migration and dispersion of the infectious agent. Whether <b>gentamycin</b> has a post-antibiotic effect (PAE) on the swarming and swimming motility of Escherichia coli (E. coli) remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to examine whether short-term pretreatment of sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>gentamycin</b> alter motility of E. coli and the mechanisms involved therein. Methods: After exposure to sub-inhibitory concentrations (0. 8 μg/ml) of gentamicin, the swarming and swimming motility of E. coli was tested in semi-solid media. Real-time PCR was used to detect the gene expression of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). The production of SDH and fumarate by E. coli pretreated with or without <b>gentamycin</b> was measured. Fumarate was added to swarming agar to determine whether fumarate could restore the swarming motility of E. coli. Results: After pretreatment of E. coli with sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>gentamycin,</b> swarming motility was repressed in the absence of growth inhibition. The expression of all four subunits of SDH was down-regulated, and the intracellular concentration of SDH and fumarate, produced by E. coli, were both decreased. Supplementary fumarate could restore the swarming motility inhibited by <b>gentamycin.</b> A selective inhibitor of SDH (propanedioic acid) could strongly repress the swarming motility. Conclusion: Sub-inhibitory concentrations of <b>gentamycin</b> inhibits the swarming motility of E. coli. This effect is mediated by a reduction in cellular fumarate caused by down-regulation of SDH. <b>Gentamycin</b> may be advantageous for treatment of E. coli infections...|$|E

Among them, one alkaline shock protein, asp 23, was up-regulated most in the gentamycin-resistant strain (21. 9 -fold increase compared with the parental strain). The asp 23 gene disruption mutant was significantly more sensitive to <b>gentamycin</b> compared with the wild type, suggesting an important role of this gene in developing the gentamycin-resistant phenotype in L. casei. Our report has described the adaptation of a probiotic strain that has acquired antibiotics resistance through long-term antibiotics exposure at the proteome level, and we revealed a novel mechanism of <b>gentamycin</b> resistance...|$|E
40|$|WE HAVE STUDIED THE ALTERATION OF THE SURFACE POTENTIAL OF THE LIPID MONOLAYER (PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE) CAUSED BY THE AMINOGLYCOSIDES <b>GENTAMYCIN,</b> STREPTOMYCIN, KANAMYCIN, TOBRAMYCIN, AMIKACIN, SISOMICIN AND NETILMICIN. THE LIPID SURFACE WAS FORMED ON 0, 145 M KCL SOLUTION IN A TEFLON TROUGH. THE SURFACE POTENTIAL WAS MEASURED WITH AN AMERICIUM 214 AIR ELECTRODE CONNECTED TO THE HIGH IMPEDANCE INPUT, OF A KEITHLEY ELECTROMETER. THE LOW IMPEDANCE INPUT OF THE ELECTROMETER, WAS CONNECTED TO A CALOMEL REFERENCE ELECTRODE. THE TEFLON TROUGH ANDTHE ELECTRODES WAS SURROUNDED BY A BRASS BOX. IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT THE AMINOGLYCOSIDES INFLUENCE TO THE LIPID MONOLAYER INDUCING AN ALTERATION OF ITS POTENTIAL. THIS ALTERATION OF THE SURFACE POTENTIAL OF THE LIPID MONOLAYER RESULTING IN BY EACH ONE OF THE AMINOGLYCOSIDES IS DIFFERENT IN ISOMOLECULAR CONCENTRATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE ALTERATION OF THE SURFACE POTENTIAL OF THE LIPID MONOLAYER, CAUSED BY STREPTOMYCIN AND AMIKACIN (POSITIVE - GOING) IS OPPOSITE TO THE ALTERATION CAUSED BY <b>GENTAMYCIN,</b> TOBRAMYCIN, KANAMYCIN, SISOMICIN AND NETILMICIN (NEGATIVE - GOING). ABSORPTION SPECTRUM OF STREPTOMYCIN AND AMIKACIN SHOWS ONE PEAK CURVE IN THE AREA OF ULTRAVIOLET LIGHT, WHILE <b>GENTAMYCIN,</b> TOBRAMYCIN, KANAMYCIN, SISOMICIN AND NETILMICIN SHOWS TWO PEAKS CURVES IN THE SAME AREA. WE DISCUSS OUR RESULTS ON A PHARMACOLOGICAL BASIS AND WE SUGGEST POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS OF OUR DATA. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the prevalence of Escherichia coli as an aetiologic agent in bacterial infections and its antimicrobial susceptibility patterns to ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, perfloxacin, <b>gentamycin</b> and cotrimoxazole as a guide for empiric therapy. A retrospective study was carried out using a clinical microbiology laboratory in Nigeria. Data retrieved include number of E. coli isolates, sources of the isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility to various fluoroquinolones, <b>gentamycin</b> and cotrimoxazole between 2005 and 2009. Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 14, Chicago IL. Out of a total of 906 bacterial isolates, E. coli accounted for 23 % (211) of the isolates. Thirty-eight percent (38. 39 %) was isolated from urine samples, 27. 96 % from high vaginal swab samples, 24. 17 % from stool samples, 0. 95 % from urethra swabs, 1. 9 % from wound swabs and 6. 6 % from semen samples. There was poor level of susceptibility to norfloxacin (2. 2 %) and cotrimoxazole (23. 7 %), susceptibility to ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and pefloxacin were 51. 1 %, 54. 7 % and 52. 5 % respectively, that of <b>gentamycin</b> was 51. 8 %. The trends across the years showed a significant increase in susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, pefloxacin and ofloxacin in 2007 after which it starte...|$|E
