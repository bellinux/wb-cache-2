5|$|After his April 2000 release, Bell {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he believed that there was extensive Federal Government corruption associated with his 1997–2000 criminal case, {{and that he was}} going to research the facts and file a lawsuit. Bell <b>filed</b> <b>this</b> lawsuit in 2003. Bell was put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and was convicted and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and Bell was released on March 12, 2012.|$|E
5|$|More than 930,000policyholders in South Florida lost {{coverage}} after 11insurance companies went bankrupt, {{caused by}} more than 600,000insurance claims <b>filed.</b> <b>This</b> led the Florida Legislature to create new entities, such as the Joint Underwriting Association, the Florida Windstorm Underwriting Association, and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, {{in an effort to}} restore adequate insurance capacity. Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. A survey by Tim Marshall and Richard Herzog of the Haag Engineer Company in Carrollton, Texas, highlighted several construction issues. On the roof of some homes, the concrete tiles were glued to felt paper, which could easily be ripped by straight line winds. At houses with shingled roofs, it was found that some of the shingles were stapled perpendicular to the long axis, also allowing them to be torn away. After the tiles or shingles were peeled off, the plywood and prefabricated trusses were exposed to the weather. Eventually, the plywood and the trusses suffered structural failure, leading to roof collapses.|$|E

Crystallisation occurs upon default of the mortgagor and registration of a notice of default, and the mortgage ranks from the date notice is <b>filed.</b> <b>This</b> means that a floating mortgage ranks lower than a fixed mortgage.|$|E

25|$|During the December {{political}} crisis Robertson advised Lloyd George to “stick to it” {{and form a}} three-man War Council, which would probably include the Foreign Secretary but not the First Lord of the Admiralty or the Secretary of State for War. He was suspected of briefing the press against Asquith, and had to assure the Palace {{that this was not}} so, and {{there is no evidence that}} he did. Had he not ousted Asquith, Lloyd George had planned to appeal to the country, his Military Secretary Colonel Arthur Lee having prepared a memo blaming Robertson and the General Staff for the loss of Serbia and Romania. Robertson warned the first meeting of the new 5-man War Cabinet (9 December) against the danger of “sideshows”. By contrast Hankey (8 December), although he thought Western Front offensives inevitable, advised sending aid to Italy and offensives in Palestine – Lloyd George <b>filed</b> <b>this</b> with the Cabinet papers and used it as the blueprint of future strategy discussions.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, the Arena Company {{refused to}} return Livingstone's players {{to him for}} the 191819 season. [...] Instead, it formed a new team, the Toronto Arena Hockey Club—popularly known as the Toronto Arenas—which could exist {{separately}} from any legal action against the Arena Company. [...] This new club was readily admitted to the NHL as a full member in good standing, and continued to use Livingstone's players. This resulted in another lawsuit being <b>filed,</b> <b>this</b> one against Arena Gardens, Gardens auditor Hubert Vearncombe (who was serving {{as president of the}} Arena Hockey Club) and Arena Hockey Club general manager Charlie Querrie. Arena Gardens argued that Livingstone did not own the NHL rights to the players and could not have suffered any damages. The court ruled in Livingstone's favour in January 1920 and awarded $20,000 in damages back-dated to April 1918, but the issue was not settled. Before the end of the year, {{under the weight of the}} judgment against it, Arena Gardens went into receivership. [...] Meanwhile, the Arena Hockey Club was sold to a group headed by Querrie, who renamed it the Toronto St. Patricks. [...] This was possible because the hockey team was a self-contained corporation, and thus beyond the reach of Livingstone.|$|E
