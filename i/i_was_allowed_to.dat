25|$|I was 25 {{years old}} and {{pursuing}} my doctorate in economics when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> spend six months of post-graduate studies in Naples, Italy. I read the Western economic textbooks and also the more general work of people like Hayek. By the time I returned to Czechoslovakia, I had {{an understanding of the}} principles of the market. In 1968, I was glad at the political liberalism of the Dubcek Prague Spring, but was very critical of the Third Way they pursued in economics.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{his anger}} at the wedding, Eleftherios Venizelos permitted, initially, that Aspasia and her mother moved to the Royal Palace with the {{condition}} that the marriage not be made public. However, the secret was soon discovered and Aspasia {{was forced to leave}} Greece to escape the scandal. Exiled, she settled firstly in Rome and then in Paris. Alexander <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> join her in the French capital six months later. Officially, the monarch made a state visit to the Allies' heads of state gathered at the Peace Conference. In reality, the stay was somehow as a honeymoon for the couple.|$|E
25|$|For this reason, {{the family}} sought to acquire lands {{that would be}} classed as unmittelbar (immediate) or held without any {{intermediate}} feudal tenure, directly from the Holy Roman Emperor. During the early 17th century Karl I of Liechtenstein was made a Fürst (prince) by the Holy Roman Emperor Matthias after siding {{with him in a}} political battle. Hans-Adam <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> purchase the minuscule Herrschaft ("Lordship") of Schellenberg and county of Vaduz (in 1699 and 1712 respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz had exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than their comital sovereign and the suzerain Emperor.|$|E

25|$|From {{the night}} of the event, Alexander I was {{suffering}} from high fever: his wound had become infected and soon developed into septicaemia. With the rapid evolution of his illness, doctors planned to amputate his leg but no one wanted to take responsibility for such an act. Operated seven times, he was cared for only by Aspasia during the four weeks which lasted his agony. Under the effect of the blood poisoning, the young King suffered terribly and his cries of pain were heard in the entire Royal Palace. On 19 October he became delirious and called out for his mother. However, the Greek government refused to allow Queen Sophia to re-enter the country. In St. Moritz, where she was exiled {{with the rest of the}} royal family, the Queen begged the Hellenic authorities to let her take care of her son but Venizelos remained adamant. Finally, Dowager Queen Olga, widow of George <b>I,</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> travel alone to Athens to be with her grandson. But delayed by rough seas, she arrived two hours after the King's death, on 25 October 1920. Informed by telegram that night, other members of the royal family learned of the death with sadness.|$|E
25|$|The subject {{upon which}} you have written to me {{is one in which}} I {{naturally}} take a more than common interest. Not only was I one of the Oxford Crew in the first Inter-University Boat-Race in 1829, but the Race was entirely set up by me, owing to the fact that though I was myself at Christ Church, Oxford, my home was at Cambridge (my father being Master of Trinity), and I had a large acquaintance there, and some-times (especially in Easter vacations) was invited to pull in one of their boats, e. g. that of St John's, in which were the now Bishops, Selwyn and Tyrrell, and Charles Merivale the historian, all now vigorous and flourishing. I may also mention, as bearing upon your enquiry, that as soon as my father heard that I had been chosen one of the Oxford Eight, and was practising for the Race, he wrote me an earnest letter, in which he desired me not to row any more, simply from anxiety lest my health should suffer. Though I was always much given to athletic exercises, even before I went to Harrow (where I was one of the Eleven in the first Matches against Eton, for four years, 1822 – 1825), my constitution was in some respects rather a delicate one. When I received his letter I went at once to my physician, told him the difficulty in which I was placed, begged him to examine my state of health, and got his authority to assure my father that so far as he could judge, rowing had not done me any harm. By this my father was satisfied, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> go on. The Race itself, which was at Henley (two miles up stream), certainly did me no harm, though at the time I was incommoded by the change to an unusual diet, — under-done beefsteaks, porter, dry bread, no butter, no tea, no vegetables. After the Race, which was on Wednesday or Tuesday (I think), I was able to play cricket, as one of the Eleven also, against Cambridge on the following Friday. The match was at Oxford. We were victorious on both occasions.|$|E

500|$|Four screenwriters {{worked on}} the property. Peter Hedges wrote the first draft, but didn't think he could do more; another writer passed. Paul Rudnick did some work on Miranda's scenes, {{followed}} by a Don Roos rewrite. After that, Aline Brosh McKenna, {{who was able to}} relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story, produced a draft after a month's work that struck the right balance for Finerman and Frankel, whose notes were incorporated into a final version, rearranging the plot significantly, following the book less closely and focusing the story on the conflict between Andrea and Miranda. She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship [...] "very liberating ... I felt <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> do what the movie wanted to be, a Faust story, a Wall Street for ladies." ...|$|E

It was quite frightening - they had machine guns on the roof. I was also allowed to drive around the perimeter but if you {{got out of the}} car there was a loudspeaker warning you to keep away. There was not a chance of going in it, and I was delighted because I knew from going to the Bank of England vaults that gold isn't stacked very high and it's all underwhelming. It gave me the chance to show the biggest gold repository in the world as I imagined it, with gold going up to heaven. I came up with this cathedral-type design. I had a big job to persuade Cubby and the director Guy Hamilton at first." ...|$|E
500|$|Fantastics {{circulation}} {{was about}} 37,000 when White took over; only about 4 {{percent of this}} was subscription sales. [...] Cohen's wife filled the subscriptions from their garage, and according to White, Cohen regarded this as a burden, and never tried to increase the subscription base. [...] Despite White's efforts, Fantastics circulation fell, from almost 37,000 {{when he took over}} as editor to less than 24,000 in the summer of 1975. [...] Cohen was rumored to be interested in selling both Fantastic and Amazing; among other possibilities, both Roger Elwood, at that time an active science fiction anthology editor, and Edward Ferman, the editor of The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, approached Cohen with a view to acquiring the titles. [...] Nothing came of it, however, and White was not aware of the possible sales. [...] He was working at a low salary, with unpaid help from friends to read unsolicited submissions—at one point he introduced a 25-cent reading fee for manuscripts from unpublished writers; the fee would be refunded if White bought the story. [...] White sometimes found himself at odds with Cohen's business partner, Arthur Bernhard, due to their different political views. [...] White's unhappiness with his working conditions culminated in his resignation after Cohen refused his proposal to publish Fantastic as a slick magazine, with larger pages and higher quality paper. [...] White commented in an article in Science Fiction Review that he had brought to the magazines [...] "a lot of energy and enthusiasm and a great many ideas for their improvement ...Well, I have put into effect nearly every idea which <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> follow through on ... and have spent most of my energy and enthusiasm." [...] Cohen was able to persuade him to stay for another year; in the event White stayed for another three.|$|E

2500|$|When {{writing in}} 2015 {{in his final}} column for Top Gear magazine, he {{credited}} the Shropshire Star as his first outlet as a motoring columnist: [...] "I started small, on the Shropshire Star with little Peugeots and Fiats and worked my way up to Ford Granadas and Rovers until, after about seven years, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> drive an Aston Martin Lagonda...

[...] Instead, he got accepted into the famed Cass Technical High School as a business major, and played the drums and trombone in the band. At 15, he began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. He credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music as they worked together in the shop. Muldoon goaded his young apprentice into forming a band: [...] "He played drums", Gillis thought. [...] "Well I guess I'll play guitar then." [...] The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as the Upholsterers.|$|E

2500|$|His last public {{statement}} was dictated {{to his daughter}} Helen in reply to receiving the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford's [...] "sorrow and affection": [...] "There is no expression of Christian sympathy that I value more {{than that of the}} ancient University of Oxford, the God-fearing and God-sustaining University of Oxford. I served her perhaps mistakenly, but {{to the best of my}} ability. [...] My most earnest prayers are hers to the uttermost and to the last". He left the house for the last time on 9 April. After 18 April he did not come down to the ground floor but still came out of bed to lie on the sofa.

2500|$|The cast of V {{features}} {{a number of}} actors from other science-fiction series, including Lost, Firefly and Smallville. Peters has stated that the casting of so many actors from a science-fiction background was coincidental, explaining: [...] "Obviously, we went for the best actors we could possibly find. It's a nice bonus {{that a lot of}} these folks have appeared in genre shows in the past, but it was not designed that way. We also wanted to make sure that as we moved forward, we honoured and respected the characters and the themes that the (original) show envisioned, while introducing brand new characters and brand new themes that make sense in a post-9/11 world." [...] Mitchell was a fan of the original series as a child, recalling: [...] "I liked the escape of it; I liked the entertainment of it. It was a fun night for me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>allowed</b> <b>to</b> watch an hour of television with my parents, and we made a kind of celebration of it. I hope that other teenagers will do that with their parents with this show." [...] Mitchell's role in V sees her play an FBI agent with traits traditionally assigned to males. She commented: [...] "I like playing a traditional hero. I don't think I've ever done it before. Sigourney Weaver said she always chooses male roles because they are meatier." [...] Mitchell characterizes Erica as having [...] "a little bit of a hero complex", but [...] "her joy and her love and her true affection is with her son, and the fact that he is in imminent danger (makes it) fun to play." ...|$|E
