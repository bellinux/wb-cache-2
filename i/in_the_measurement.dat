5|$|All {{the above}} Raman modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurement,</b> which can locally heat the nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- A new robust {{estimator}} {{based on}} the concept of uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurements</b> is developed <b>in</b> this paper. <b>The</b> uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurements</b> is modeled via deterministic upper and lower bounds on measurement errors, which take into account known meter accuracies. Inequality constraints are constructed to model <b>the</b> uncertainty <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurements.</b> A solution point satisfying most inequality constraints is the objective of the proposed estimator. Hence, this estimator is known as Maximum Constraints Satisfaction (MCS). The Robustness and performance of the proposed estimator is discussed via simulated problems of simple regression examples and D. C. three-bus system. Various scenarios of leverage measurements and bad data have been considered for further assessment of the performance of <b>the</b> MCS estimator. <b>In</b> particular, it is shown that the (MCS) estimator performs significantly well in situation where collinearity exists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurements.</b> Results show that the proposed estimator is an accurate and reliable estimator...|$|R

Zero output is given when the magnitude of the difference in the voltages multiplied by the gain of the amplifier is less than the voltage limits.

25|$|The {{design of}} the {{electrodes}} is the key part: These are rod-like structures usually made of glass, with a bulb containing the sensor at the bottom. The glass electrode for measuring the pH has a glass bulb specifically designed to be selective to hydrogen-ion concentration.

The electronic amplifier detects the difference in electrical potential between the two electrodes generated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>measurement</b> and converts the potential difference to pH units. The magnitude of the electrochemical potential across the glass bulb is linearly related to the pH according to the Nernst equation.|$|E
