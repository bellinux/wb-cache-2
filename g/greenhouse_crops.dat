40|$|Abstract. BACKGROUND: Insecticide {{resistance}} in Trialeurodes vaporariorum W. is {{unknown in the}} species’ northern distribution range where it inhabits mainly commercial greenhouses. Resistance development in whiteflies feeding on year-round <b>crops</b> in <b>greenhouses</b> is possible due to use of chemical treatments to back up biocontrol. We tested the response levels to spiromesifen, pymetrozine and imidacloprid in whiteflies collected from seven greenhouses within a 35 km radius in Western Finland. RESULTS: All except one (PR) population had LC 50 values below the recommended concentrations for the tested compounds. However, some populations showed reduced susceptibility to pymetrozine in comparison to reference susceptible population. Resistance ratios to pymetrozine were highly variable (RR 0. 5 - 39. 7) even among closely-located greenhouses and higher than those for imidacloprid (RR 1. 05 - 10. 5) and spiromesifen (RR 0. 8 - 11. 5). LC 50 values and application frequencies of pymetrozine correlated positively among the sampled populations. CONCLUSION: High variation in resistance levels to pymetrozine among populations within natural whitefly dispersal limits reflects variation in the usage of this compound among individual <b>greenhouse</b> <b>crop</b> producers. Thus, resistance management is recommended on individual <b>greenhouse</b> <b>crop</b> producer level, even in a dense production cluster...|$|R

40|$|Adaptation of a {{greenhouse}} climate management strategy to local climate conditions {{is important for}} the improvement of resource use efficiency of <b>greenhouse</b> <b>crop</b> production. In this paper the optimal greenhouse climate management under hot, humid, subtropical summer conditions was investigated through simulation analysis based on the Greenhouse Process (KASPRO) model, previously validated under this particular conditions. The study was limited to affordable means of <b>greenhouse</b> design, <b>crop</b> and climate management such as ventilation capacity, canopy size and whitewashing, in {{a greenhouse}} without injection of carbon dioxide. Obviously, the increase of greenhouse ventilation capacity leads to an increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the greenhouse air, canopy transpiration, and thus evaporative cooling of the <b>greenhouse</b> air and <b>crop</b> canopy, and in turn to an increase of crop biomass production. The results show, however, that there is a rather sharp ceiling beyond which there is little gain in increasing ventilation capacity. For a cucumber crop under the summer conditions typical of Shanghai, the ventilation capacity of the greenhouse should be about 40 volume changes per hour. The balance of assimilation, respiration and evaporative cooling ensure that crop biomass production is maximal at a canopy leaf area index of...|$|R
