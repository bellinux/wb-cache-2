5|$|Of the 240 {{people killed}} during the storm, 135 were workers on the Florida East Coast Railway. The {{hurricane}} {{eventually led to the}} end of pineapple production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> <b>Keys</b> for commercial purposes in 1915, although this was amplified by two further hurricanes in the following years. In 1947, Project Cirrus, a collaboration of the United States Air Force, attempted to modify a hurricane; however, the seeded storm made a sudden re-curvature and came ashore near Charleston, South Carolina. As a result, several lawsuits were filed, although they were denied after the path of this storm was revealed to have been similar to the 1906 hurricane.|$|E
