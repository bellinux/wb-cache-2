5000|$|The {{fracture}} with <b>Dalits</b> {{came during}} the same time period. After T. M. Nair's death, <b>Dalits</b> were slowly pushed out of the party. The [...] "Pulianthope incidents" [...] (also called as the [...] "B&C Mill strike") soured the relationship of non-Brahmin upper castes like Vellalas, Beri Chettis, Balija Naidus, Kammas and Kapus with <b>Dalits.</b> On 11 May 1921, both <b>Dalits</b> and caste Hindus went on strike in the Carnatic textile mill. On 20 June, workers in Buckingham Mill followed. The <b>Dalits</b> were quickly persuaded to end the strike, but the caste Hindus continued to strike. This created animosity between the two groups. In an ensuing clash between the police and caste Hindus, several were killed. Justice leaders accused the Government of creating problems by pampering the <b>Dalits.</b> The party paper Justice claimed: ...|$|R

50|$|Again, in the Round Table Conferences in 1930-32, {{the concept}} of {{separate}} electorates for the so-called Untouchables (now called <b>Dalits)</b> was raised by Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, {{as a way to}} ensure sufficient representation for the minority <b>Dalits,</b> in government. This provision was strongly opposed by Gandhi {{on the grounds that the}} move would disintegrate Hindu society. If the <b>Dalits</b> were given a separate electorate, then certain constituencies would have been reserved for them, and only the <b>Dalits</b> would have been able to vote for the candidates contesting those seats, thus alienating the rest of the Hindus. Finally, a compromise was reached with Ambedkar and Gandhi with the Poona Pact in which the parties agreed that certain constituencies would be reserved for the <b>Dalits,</b> where the <b>Dalits</b> could elect 4 candidates per constituency who would then be candidates for election by the joint electorate.|$|R

500|$|The Justice Party {{leaders were}} {{extremely}} vociferous in their attacks on <b>Dalits</b> and the Labour Department.

M. C. Rajah, {{the leader of the}} <b>Dalits</b> in the Justice Party, in turn, retorted by describing the criticism of <b>Dalits</b> by Justice Party members as [...] "the high-handed poisonous action of members of a party who after inflicting all known and unknown injury on our community shed crocodile tears and pose as friends of the Depressed classes". Though the B & C mills strike was eventually settled through the mediation of C.

5|$|Nandanar (also spelt as Nantanar), {{also known}} as Tirunalaippovar (Thirunaalaippovar) and Tiru Nalai Povar Nayanar, was a Nayanar saint, who is venerated in the Hindu sect of Shaivism. He is the only <b>Dalit</b> ("untouchable") saint in the Nayanars. He is {{generally}} counted as the eighteenth {{in the list of}} 63 Nayanars. Like the other Nayanars, he was a devout devotee of the god Shiva.|$|E
5|$|The Dalits {{strongly}} believe in his piety and portray Brahmins as {{the root cause}} of all the misery of the Nayanar. Nandanar fits in the <b>Dalit</b> narrative that proves that their religiosity is on par or superior to the higher castes. They say that Nandanar was 'swallowed by God'. The sashes round Nataraja's waist are interpreted as the legs of the saint, who merged into the god.|$|E

5|$|Political {{analysts have}} {{suggested}} {{several reasons for}} this victory, including the popularity of Modi, {{and the loss of}} support for the Congress due to the corruption scandals in its previous term. The BJP was also able to expand its traditionally upper-caste, upper-class support base and received significant support from middle-class and <b>Dalit</b> people, as well as among Other Backward Classes. Its support among Muslims remained low; only 8% of Muslim voters voted for the BJP. The BJP was also very successful at mobilising its supporters, and raising voter turnout among them.|$|E

5|$|Names {{of three}} poets from the 11th century {{and some of}} their poems are available. Madara Chennaiah, a cobbler turned saint, is {{considered}} by H.S. Shiva Prakash as the first Vachana poet, and was held in high esteem by latter day poets of the 12th century, including Basavanna. Only ten of Chennaiah's poems, expressing his resentment of the caste system in metaphors taken from the cobblers' trade, are extant today. Dohara Kakkaiah is the second poet. A <b>dalit</b> by birth, his six available poems are confessional in nature, a theme seen in the later poems of Basavanna. Devara Dasimaiah (or Jedara Dasimaiah, 1040) is better known because a hundred and fifty of his poems are available. Written in a deft and concise language of proverbs and metaphors, his poems encourage monotheistic belief in the god Shiva. Dasimaiah's wife Duggale qualifies as Kannada's first women poet, though only a few of her poems are available.|$|E

Hardline and orthodox Hindus do not consider {{them as part of}} their society. The <b>Dalits</b> generally perform menial and degrade jobs. Social backwardness, lack of access to food, education and health care keep them in bondage of the upper castes. In hundreds of districts and several states, the <b>Dalits</b> live today {{in a constant state of}} fear due to threats to their life. For <b>Dalits</b> throughout South Asia, caste remains a determinative factor for the attainment of social, political, civil and economic rights.

5|$|The tale of Nandanar is retold {{numerous}} times in folk tales, folk music, plays, films and literature in Tamil society. While Nandanar {{is included in}} Nayanar list since the 8th century CE, the 12th century CE Periya Puranam gives a full hagiographical account of his life. The tale focuses on two miracles attributed to him. In Sivalokanathar Temple, Tirupunkur; his prayers {{are said to have}} moved a giant stone bull, which still appears in the moved position in the temple. Nandanar is said to have ritually purified himself by fire at Thillai Nataraja Temple, Chidambaram. Nandar's tale features in temple lore and religious literature related to both these temples. Gopalakrishna Bharati's 19th century retelling of the saint's life remains the basis of many later retellings. It expands the original narrative adding elements of oppression of the <b>Dalit</b> saint by higher castes. While higher caste retellings of the tale focus on the saint's observance of caste norms, Dalits emphasize his exploitation and superior religiosity.|$|E
