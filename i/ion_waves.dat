50|$|Constriction {{has been}} shown in vitro to occur when NE is placed in the synapse and is taken up by {{astrocyte}} receptors. NE uptake leads to an increase in intracellular astrocyte Ca. When these calcium <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> spread {{down the length of the}} astrocyte, phospholipase A (PLA) is activated which in turn mobilizes arachidonic acid. These two compounds are transported to the smooth muscle and there react with cytochrome P450 to make 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE), which acts through yet to-be-determined mechanisms to induce vasoconstriction. It has also been shown that agonists of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) also increase intracellular Ca to produce constriction.|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} and explanation of short wavelength antenna interference effects observed in spacecraft plasma wave data have provided an important new method of determining {{limits on the}} wavelength, direction of propagation, and Doppler shift of short wavelength electrostatic waves. Using the ISEE- 1 wideband electric field data, antenna interference effects {{have been identified in}} the <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> upstream of the earth's bow shock. This identification implies that wavelengths of the upstream <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> are shorter than the antenna length. The interference effects also provide new measurements of the direction of propagation of the <b>ion</b> <b>waves.</b> The new measurements show that the wave vectors of the <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> are not parallel to the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) as previously reported. The direction of propagation {{does not appear to be}} controlled by the IMF. In addition, analysis of the Doppler shift of the short wavelength <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> has provided a measurement of the dispersion relation. The upper limit of the rest frame frequency was found to be on the order of the ion plasma frequency. At this frequency, the wavelength is on the order of a few times the Debye length. The results of this study now provide strong evidence that the <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> in the upstream region are Doppler-shifted ion acoustic waves. Previously announced in STAR as N 83 - 3632...|$|E

Many phase gaps of the soliton’s carrier appear when <b>ion</b> <b>wave</b> intensity is strongly enough. Thus the possibility of stochastic accelleration by the phase gap is also discussed.

40|$|The {{velocity}} space {{diffusion of}} ions due to <b>ion</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence is investigated experimentally using an <b>ion</b> <b>wave</b> echo. Experiments are so arranged that the streaming perturbation {{due to the}} first excited wave propagates through the localized region where the <b>ion</b> <b>wave</b> turbulence is excited, {{to interact with the}} second excited wave. The resultant second order <b>ion</b> <b>wave</b> echo damps in comparison with the case of no turbulence. The variation of the echo amplitude as the power of the spectrum of the turbulence is changed is observed, which is in quantitative agreement with the theoretical prediction. It is also revealed that the turbulent waves are far more effective than the monochromatic waves in increasing the effective collisions...|$|R

40|$|Some {{similarities}} between <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> in plasmas and gravity waves in incompressible fluids are investigated. It is shown that for zero ion temperature the ion-wave dispersion relation {{is similar to}} that of gravity waves in a stratified liquid between rigid, horizontal walls; for large wavelength the <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> behave as the surface gravity waves of shallow-water theory. The general character of the pattern of <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> arising in steady plasma flows is analyzed for arbitrary ion temperature, wavelength, and acoustic mach number (which is based on the ion-acoustic speed), and is compared to the pattern of surface gravity waves in steady water flows when surface tension is taken into account...|$|E
40|$|The laser and plasma {{conditions}} {{expected in}} ignition experiments using indirect drive inertial confinement {{have been studied}} experimentally. It {{has been found that}} {{there are at least three}} ways in which <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> can be stimulated in these plasmas and have significant effect on the energy balance and distribution in the target. First <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> can be stimulated by a single laser beam by the process of Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) in which an ion acoustic and a scattered electromagnetic wave grow from noise. Second, in a plasma where more than one beam intersect, <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> can be excited at the `beat` frequency and wave number of the intersecting beams, causing the side scatter instability to be seeded, and substantial energy to be transferred between the beams [R. K. Kirkwood et. al. Phys. Re 0319 v. Lett. 76, 2065 (1996) ]. And third, <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> may be stimulated by the decay of electron plasma waves produced by Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS), thereby inhibiting the SRS process [R. K. Kirkwood et. al.

40|$|Abstract—Excitation of {{electrostatic}} <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>waves</b> (EICW) in a magnetized dusty plasma by an {{ion beam}} is studied {{taking into account}} the effect of dust particle size, dust particle charge and dust particle number density variations. The presence of dust grain charge fluctuations modifies the dispersion relation for <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>waves</b> in dusty plasma. It is shown that in the absence of ion beam, the ion cyclotron mode damps due to dust charge fluctuations and an additional damping dust charge fluctuation mode is induced in plasma. The ion beam propagating parallel to the magnetic field drives <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>waves</b> to instability via Cerenkov interaction. Using the analytical and numerical results the influence of the relative density of negatively charged dust particles on growth rate of <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>waves</b> is studied. The dust grain size distribution has also significant contributions on the growth rate of <b>ion</b> cyclotron <b>waves.</b> 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} with the excitation of plasma waves at the boundaries of the streams of energetic particles which are associated with the earth's bow shock. The analysis was motivated by observational results acquired with the ISEE spacecraft (Parks et al., 1981). It is shown theoretically that the density gradient of energetic ions can only excite <b>ion</b> <b>waves,</b> whereas that of energetic electrons can excite both <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> and Langmuir waves. This conclusion appears to be consistent with observations...|$|E
40|$|The {{existence}} of localized <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> in a dense quantum plasma is established. Specifically, ion solitary waves are stationary solutions of the equations {{composed of the}} nonlinear ion continuity and ion momentum equations, together with the Poisson equation and the inertialess electron momentum equation in which the electric force is balanced by the quantum force associated with the Bohm potential that causes electron tunneling at nanoscales. The solitary <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> are characterized by a large-amplitude electrostatic potential and ion density maxima and smaller amplitude minima on the flanks of the solitary waves. We identify the speed interval for the {{existence of}} the ion solitary waves around a quantum Mach number that is of the order of unity...|$|E

40|$|Two-dimensional three-component plasma system {{consisting}} of nonextensive electrons, positrons, and relativistic thermal ions is considered. The well-known Kadomtsev-Petviashvili-Burgers and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations are derived {{to study the}} basic characteristics of small but finite amplitude <b>ion</b> acoustic <b>waves</b> of the plasmas by using the reductive perturbation method. The influences of positron concentration, electron-positron and ion-electron temperature ratios, strength of electron and positrons nonextensivity, and relativistic streaming factor on the propagation of <b>ion</b> acoustic <b>waves</b> in the plasmas are investigated. It is revealed that the electrostatic compressive and rarefactive <b>ion</b> acoustic <b>waves</b> are obtained for superthermal electrons and positrons, but only compressive <b>ion</b> acoustic <b>waves</b> are found and the potential profiles become steeper in case of subthermal positrons and electrons...|$|R

40|$|It {{is argued}} that the {{cyclotron}} drift instability (coupled <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> and electron Bernstein modes) can explain many structural features of the weak electrostatic turbulence observed in bow shock magnetic-field gradients and thus that it provides a more attractive speculation than the ion acoustic or Buneman instabilities previously suggested as weak turbulence sources...|$|E
40|$|Dynamics of {{the dust}} {{charging}} {{and the influence of}} the ion density and temperature on electrostatic nonlinear waves in a dusty plasma having trapped electrons are investigated by numerical calculation. The nonlinear structure {{of the dust}} charging is examined, and it is shown that the characteristics of the dust charge number sensitively depend on the plasma potential, Mach number, trapped electron temperature, ion density and temperature. An increase of the ion temperature decreases the dust charging rate and the propagation speed of <b>ion</b> <b>waves.</b> It turns out that a decrease of the trapped electron temperature increases the charging rate of dust grains. It is found that the existence of <b>ion</b> <b>waves</b> sensitively depends on the ion to electron density ratio. New findings of variable-charge dust grain particles, ion density and temperature in a dusty plasma with trapped electrons are predicted. ...|$|E

Dependencies of the <b>ion</b> <b>wave</b> on radial position, pressure, input power, and magnetic field are investigated. Measurements of the wavelength show that the wave is traveling azimuthally at approximately the ion sound speed in the direction of electron gyration.

40|$|Plasma wave {{measurements}} on the Helios 1 and 2 spacecraft have revealed {{the occurrence of}} electric field turbulence in the solar wind at frequencies between the electron and ion plasma frequencies. Wavelength measurements with the Imp 6 spacecraft now provide strong evidence that these <b>waves</b> are shortwavelength <b>ion</b> acoustic <b>waves</b> which are Doppler-shifted upward in frequency by {{the motion of the}} solar wind. Comparison of the Helios results with measurements from the earth-orbiting Imp 6 and 8 spacecraft shows that the <b>ion</b> acoustic <b>wave</b> turbulence detected in interplanetary space has characteristics essentially identical to those of bursts of electrostatic turbulence generated by protons streaming into the solar wind from the earth's bow shock. In a few cases, enhanced <b>ion</b> acoustic <b>wave</b> intensities have been observed in direct association with abrupt increases in the anisotropy of the solar wind electron distribution. This relationship strongly suggests that the <b>ion</b> acoustic <b>waves</b> detected by Helios far from the earth are produced by an electron heat flux instability, as was suggested by Forslund.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of electron injection in the direct laser acceleration (DLA) regime was investigated {{by means of}} three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical analysis. It is shown that when an ultra-intense laser pulse propagates into a near-critical density or relativistically transparent plasma, the longitudinal charge-separation electric field excites an <b>ion</b> <b>wave.</b> The <b>ion</b> <b>wave</b> modulates the local electric field and acts {{as a set of}} potential wells to guide the electrons, located {{on the edge of the}} plasma channel, to the central region, where the DLA takes place later on. In addition, it is pointed out that the self-generated azimuthal magnetic fields tend to suppress the injection process of electrons by deflecting them away from the laser field region.
