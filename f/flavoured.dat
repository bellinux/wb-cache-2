5|$|Since ancient times, the mallard {{has been}} eaten as food. The wild mallard was eaten in Neolithic Greece. Usually, only the breast and thigh meat is eaten. It {{does not need}} to be hung before preparation, and is often braised or roasted, {{sometimes}} <b>flavoured</b> with bitter orange or with port.|$|E
5|$|Some dishes can {{be traced}} back to ancient Greece: lentil soup, fasolada, retsina (white or rosé wine <b>flavoured</b> with pine resin) and pasteli (sesame seeds baked with honey); some to the Hellenistic and Roman periods: loukaniko (dried pork sausage); and Byzantium: feta cheese, avgotaraho (bottarga) and paximadhia (rusk).|$|E
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. <b>Flavoured</b> teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

40|$|Although {{monophenols}} {{are known}} {{to contribute to the}} <b>flavour</b> of many foods and beverages, little is known about their influence on beer <b>flavour.</b> Therefore, the contribution of 11 monophenols to the overall beer <b>flavour</b> was studied by determining their <b>flavour</b> thresholds. Large differences in sensitivity were observed between individual tasters. Next, <b>flavour</b> interactions between monophenols were examined in nine binary mixtures, which showed that strong interactions like synergy and antagonism occur. Based on these results, the <b>flavour</b> contribution of the monophenols was estimated by calculating <b>flavour</b> units. These proved to be rather low for most of the studied monophenols. However, recombination experiments demonstrated that monophenols enriched beer <b>flavour</b> with spicy, smokey and vanilla <b>flavour</b> aspects. This showed how monophenols might influence overall <b>flavour,</b> even at sub-threshold concentrationsstatus: publishe...|$|R
5|$|Nigerian cuisine, like West African cuisine in general, {{is known}} for its {{richness}} and variety. Many different spices, herbs and flavourings are used in conjunction with palm oil or groundnut oil to create deeply <b>flavoured</b> sauces and soups often made very hot with chili peppers. Nigerian feasts are colourful and lavish, while aromatic market and roadside snacks cooked on barbecues or fried in oil are plentiful and varied.|$|E
5|$|One stew {{that may}} be served with {{couscous}} is the Moroccan tagine, a hearty, somewhat dry dish of meat and vegetables, cooked slowly in a pot (called a tagine) with a tall conical lid. Dishes from the Maghreb region of North Africa are often coloured and <b>flavoured</b> with the hot spice mixtures harissa and ras el hanout (containing such spices as cumin, coriander, saffron, cinnamon, cloves, chillies, and paprika). Other characteristic flavourings of the region are preserved lemons and dried apricots and raisins.|$|E
5|$|Risotto is a dish {{made using}} Italian short-grain rice, {{which is both}} highly {{absorbent}} and resistant to turning into a pudding when cooked with stock and <b>flavoured</b> with onions and garlic, cooked in butter. Anna Gosetti della Salda's book of Italian regional cookery lists 37 risotto recipes, 18 {{of them from the}} Veneto. Variations among Veneto risottos include additions of fish and white wine; chicken; eel; mushrooms and grated Parmesan cheese; quails; small pieces of beef; courgettes (zucchini); clams; ragù; beans; mussels; prawns; cuttlefish; and asparagus.|$|E

5|$|Juniperus communis berries {{vary from}} four to twelvemillimeters in diameter; other species are mostly similar in size, though some are larger, notably J. drupacea (20–28mm). Unlike the {{separated}} and woody scales of a typical pine cone, those in a juniper berry remain fleshy and merge into a unified covering surrounding the seeds. The berries are green when young, and mature to a purple-black colour over about 18 months in most species, including J. communis (shorter, 8–10 months in a few species, and about 24 months in J. drupacea). The mature, dark berries are usually but not exclusively used in cuisine, while gin is <b>flavoured</b> with fully grown but immature green berries.|$|E
5|$|Their diet {{consisted}} of mainly grains and beans and in fishing communities fish was usually substituted for meat. Bread, wine, and olives were important staples of Byzantine diet with soldiers on campaign eating double-baked and dried bread called paximadion (Greek: παξιμάδιον). As in antiquity and modern times, {{the most common}} cultivations in the choraphia (Greek: χωράφια) were olive groves and vineyards. While Liutprand of Cremona, a visitor from Italy, found Greek wine irritating as it was often <b>flavoured</b> with resin (retsina) most other Westerners admired Greek wines, Cretan in particular being famous.|$|E
5|$|Herdwicks are a dual-purpose breed, {{producing}} strongly <b>flavoured</b> {{lamb and}} mutton and a coarse, grey wool. This slowly maturing breed {{is one of}} the most hardy of all the British hill sheep breeds, withstanding the cold and relentless rain of the Lake District at heights upwards of 3,000 feet (about 1,000 metres). Most Herdwicks spend winter on the fells, from approximately December to April. They are normally left to graze freely on the hillsides (without any additional feed), but each ewe tends to stay in her heaf (the local term for heft), the same small area of fell. Due to the rough conditions on fells, lambing losses can be as high as 25%. This ability to thrive unassisted is part of the reason fell farmers so highly value Herdwicks over much higher-producing lowland breeds.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the planning abilities of nonhumans, specifically rats. This was assessed by the animals’ tendency to behave in response to future rather than present motivations. For the purposes of this study the future motivation in question was anticipatory sensory specific satiety, i. e., the animals were trained to expect satiating exposure to a certain <b>flavour</b> of rat pellet in the near future. At the testing phase of the study the animals were offered an unexpected choice of two <b>flavours</b> prior to being exposed to the excess of the experimental <b>flavour.</b> This unexpected <b>flavour</b> choice consisted of the <b>flavour</b> that the animal was about to receive (the <b>flavour</b> congruous with the animal’s expectation), and an alternative <b>flavour,</b> of equal familiarity and palatability (the incongruous <b>flavour).</b> The consumption of the congruous and incongruous <b>flavours</b> was recorded. When faced with this choice, an animal successfully anticipating satiation to the upcoming <b>flavour</b> would be expected to consume proportionally more of the alternative (incongruous) <b>flavour,</b> in order to maintain the pleasantness of the anticipated <b>flavour.</b> However the results were inconclusive: there was no significant difference between the proportion of the congruous and the incongruous <b>flavours</b> consumed, suggesting that the current group of animals was not capable of spontaneously anticipating the upcoming <b>flavour.</b> An altered procedure then investigated whether the animals were capable of learning to anticipate the upcoming <b>flavour</b> by introducing regular (and therefore expected) <b>flavour</b> choices. Under these new circumstances the animals consumed significantly higher proportions of the congruous compared to the incongruous <b>flavour.</b> Taken together, these results suggest both that the animals were unable to spontaneously anticipate being satiated by an upcoming <b>flavour,</b> and were unable to learn to anticipate this satiation following repeated trials. The results and certain assumptions of the study are discussed...|$|R

5|$|The first {{historical}} {{mention of}} the use of hops in beer was from 822 AD in monastery rules written by Adalhard the Elder, also known as Adalard of Corbie, though the date normally given for widespread cultivation of hops for use in beer is the thirteenth century. Before the thirteenth century, and until the sixteenth century, during which hops took over as the dominant flavouring, beer was <b>flavoured</b> with other plants; for instance, grains of paradise or alehoof. Combinations of various aromatic herbs, berries, and even ingredients like wormwood would be combined into a mixture known as gruit and used as hops are now used. Some beers today, such as Fraoch' by the Scottish Heather Ales company and Cervoise Lancelot by the French Brasserie-Lancelot company, use plants other than hops for flavouring.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} Jordanian dish is mansaf, the national dish of Jordan. The dish {{is a symbol}} for Jordanian hospitality and {{is influenced by the}} Bedouin culture. Mansaf is eaten on different occasions such as funerals, weddings and on religious holidays. It consists of a plate of rice with meat that was boiled in thick yogurt, sprayed with nuts and sometimes herbs. As an old tradition, the dish is eaten using one's hands, but the tradition is not always used. Simple fresh fruit is often served towards the end of a Jordanian meal, but there is also dessert, such as baklava, hareeseh, knafeh, halva and qatayef, a dish made specially for Ramadan. In Jordanian cuisine, drinking coffee and tea <b>flavoured</b> with na'na or meramiyyeh is almost a ritual.|$|E
5|$|William's elder brother, the Prince of Wales, {{had been}} Prince Regent since 1811 {{because of the}} mental illness of their father, George III. In 1820, the King died, leaving the Crown to the Prince Regent, who became George IV. William, Duke of Clarence, was now second {{in the line of}} succession, preceded only by his brother, Frederick, Duke of York. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate {{relatively}} frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water <b>flavoured</b> with lemon. Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered {{only a matter of time}} before he became king. When the Duke of York died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming Prime Minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were going, and remaining away for ten days. The King, through the Prime Minister, by now Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, requested his resignation; he complied.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{cognitive}} {{mechanisms for}} the analysis of <b>flavour</b> information remain poorly understood. Patients with semantic dementia (SD) could potentially provide a window on these mechanisms; however, while abnormal eating behaviour and altered food preferences are common in SD, <b>flavour</b> processing has been little studied in this disorder. Here we undertook a detailed investigation of <b>flavour</b> processing in three patients at different stages of SD. One patient with a clinical syndrome of logopenic aphasia (LPA) was studied as a disease control, and six healthy control subjects also participated. Olfaction was assessed using the University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test and processing of <b>flavours</b> was assessed using a novel battery to assess <b>flavour</b> perception, <b>flavour</b> identification, and congruence and affective valence of <b>flavour</b> combinations. Patients with SD performed equivalently to healthy controls on the perceptual subtest, while their ability to identify <b>flavours</b> or to determine congruence of <b>flavour</b> combinations was impaired. Classification of <b>flavours</b> according to affective valence was comparable to healthy controls. In contrast, the patient with LPA exhibited a perceptual deficit with relatively preserved identification of <b>flavours,</b> but impaired ability to determine <b>flavour</b> congruence, which did not benefit from affective valence. Olfactory and <b>flavour</b> identification performance was correlated in both patients and controls. We propose that SD produces a true deficit of <b>flavour</b> knowledge (an associative agnosia), while other peri-Sylvian pathologies may lead to deficient <b>flavour</b> perception. Our findings are consistent with emerging evidence from healthy subjects for a cortical hierarchy for processing <b>flavour</b> information, instantiated in a brain network that includes the insula, anterior temporal lobes and orbitofrontal cortex. The findings suggest a potential mechanism for the development of food fads and other abnormal eating behaviours...|$|R

We explain the implications of <b>flavour</b> physics for new physics. We emphasize the “new physics <b>flavour</b> puzzle”. As an explicit example, we explain how the recent measurements ofD 0 −D 0 mixing constrain the supersymmetric <b>flavour</b> structure. We explain how the ATLAS and CMS experiments can solve the new physics <b>flavour</b> puzzle and perhaps shed light on the standard model <b>flavour</b> puzzle.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has established that caffeine consumption can reinforce changes in liking for caffeine-paired <b>flavours,</b> while pairing a novel <b>flavour</b> with a liked or dislike taste can also result in enduring changes in liking for the <b>flavour.</b> The present study examined how these {{two forms of}} flavour-learning interact. 72 habitual caffeine consumers who liked sweet tastes rated the odour and <b>flavour</b> of a novel tea drink before and after four training sessions where the <b>flavour</b> was paired with either 100 mg caffeine or placebo {{in one of three}} <b>flavour</b> contexts: added sweetness (aspartame), bitterness (quinine) or control. The liking for both the odour and <b>flavour</b> of the tea increased after pairing with caffeine regardless of <b>flavour</b> context, while pairing with bitterness reduced <b>flavour</b> liking regardless of the presence of caffeine. Pairing with quinine increased the rated bitterness of the tea odour, and reduced the rated sweetness of the tea <b>flavour,</b> post-training, independent of effects of caffeine. These data suggest that flavour-caffeine and flavour-flavour associations have additive effects on drink liking, while confirming that flavour-flavour associations can alter the immediate sensory experience of a <b>flavour</b> alone...|$|R
