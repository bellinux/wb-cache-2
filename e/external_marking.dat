This system in 2008 was undergoing trials in South Africa.|$|E
40|$|Zoologists {{distinguish}} individual animals using marking techniques. Generally they {{test the}} potential influence of marking on survival only; the influence on behaviour is usually neglected. We evaluated {{the influence of}} two <b>external</b> <b>marking</b> techniques (nail polish and queen-bee marker) on the behaviour of common pill woodlouse, Armadillidium vulgare. The behaviour was examined from two points of view: (1) activity during 24 hours and (2) specific expressions of behaviour (exploring, feeding, resting and hiding) over a 24 hour period. We compared behaviour among woodlice marked with nail polish and queen-bee marker with the unmarked control group during a nine-day experiment. Although {{we did not find}} any influence of marking on survival, there was an evident influence on behaviour in most cases. Generally, in the groups of marked individuals of A. vulgare there were large differences observed against the control group in the overall activity. Activity of marked individuals was significantly reduced and they preferred hiding. The influence of polish and marker on the overall frequencies of behavioural categories was evident, mainly in feeding, resting and hiding. The influence on the frequency of exploring was significant in the polish marked group only...|$|E
40|$|Leatherbacks {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} species of sea turtles. Their global population size had decreased dramatically over the past several decades. Difficulties in applying long-term marking methods on leatherbacks, have significantly hindered our ability to generate an accurate population estimate and to track population changes on the scale of individuals. <b>External</b> <b>marking</b> methods are plagued by high rates of tag loss which compromise the utility of tagging as a means of long-term identification. While having substantially better retention rates, the high cost PIT tags and the specialized equipment necessary to detect them, have limited the expansion of this technique. This project outlined the need for innovative approaches to identifying turtles and sought to resolve some of the issues plaguing traditional tagging protocols by reinvestigating the feasibility of using photo-identification to recognize individual leatherbacks. Pioneering studies of pink spot photo-identification by McDonald and Dutton (1996) showed that the pineal spot of the leatherback is distinct enough to be used as a unique identifier. This research investigated whether individual turtles could be recognized by their “pink spot” when a large sample (~ 400) was drawn from a very large nesting population (~ 3, 000 nesting annually). It also sought to determine whether identification could be automated using photo-identification software. The results indicated that the pineal “pink” spot’s form has sufficient variation to be used as a unique identifier in photo-identification studies. Using the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) function we were able to successfully automate identification. Through a cascade filtering approach the program was able to achieve one hundred percent matching accuracy, while eliminating the possibility of false negatives. Further studies are required to examine the degree of deviation that may occur within the pink spot over time, and to refine our methodologies to expand the use of this method amongst leatherback researchers...|$|E

Tablets therefore only reflect the chemical synthesis procedure of the active component, diluents added, and the pressing (press marks, etc.) at clandestine laboratory. Because of no or very less effects of trafficking, tablets show the original physical and morphological characteristics as well as chemical information. The manufacturing process of tablets involves two steps, the synthesis, and the pressing. The concentration of heroin and other components in illicit morphia tablets is the same as manufactured. From intelligence and forensic point of view, complete drug profiling of tablets will help to determine the origin.|$|R

Scientific literature was reviewed to quantify the number and type of studies that have investigated behaviour and survival of anadromous forms of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta), steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and cutthroat trout (Oncorhynchus clarkii). We examined three categories of tags including electronic (e. g. acoustic, radio, archival), passive (e. g. <b>external</b> <b>marks,</b> Carlin, coded wire, passive integrated transponder [PIT]), and biological (e. g. otolith, genetic, scale, parasites).

Did Mr. Hastings endeavor to make his strength equal to the task imposed on him? No: the direct contrary. In proportion as he augmented the burdens of this man, in just that proportion he took away his strength and power of supporting these burdens. There was not one of the <b>external</b> <b>marks</b> of honor which attended the government of Cheyt Sing that he did not take away from the new Rajah; and still, when this new man came to his new authority, deprived of all <b>external</b> <b>marks</b> of consequence, and degraded in the opinion of his subjects, he was to extort from his people an additional revenue, payable to the Company, of fifteen lacs of rupees more than was paid by the late Rajah in all the plenitude of undivided authority. To increase this difficulty still more, the father and guardian of this inexperienced youth was a man who had no credit or reputation in the country. This circumstance alone was a sufficient drawback from the weight of his authority; but Mr. Hastings took care that he should be divested of it altogether; for, as our charge states, he placed him under the immediate direction of Mr. Markham, and consequently Mr. Markham was the governor of the country. Could a man with a reduced, divided, contemptible authority venture to strike such bold and hardy strokes as would be efficient without being oppressive? Could he or any other man, thus bound and shackled, execute such vigorous and energetic measures as were necessary to realize such an enormous tribute as was imposed upon this unhappy country? ...|$|R

Meanwhile, rapidly developing new technologies made it increasingly easy to manufacture an ever-improving, high-quality product.|$|R

60|$|In fact, Fergus Mac-Ivor, of whom a Frenchman {{might have}} said as truly as of any man in the Highlands, 'Qu'il connoit bien ses gens' {{had no idea of}} raising himself in the eyes of an English young man of fortune by {{appearing}} with a retinue of idle Highlanders disproportioned to the occasion.

Therefore, although, had he been to receive a brother chieftain, he would probably have been attended by all that retinue which Evan described with so much unction, he judged it more respectable to advance to meet Waverley with a single attendant, a very handsome Highland boy, who carried his master's shooting-pouch and his broadsword, without which he seldom went abroad.|$|R
