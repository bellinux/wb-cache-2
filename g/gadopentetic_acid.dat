5000|$|<b>Gadopentetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is one of}} {{the trade}} names for a gadolinium-based MRI {{contrast}} agent, usually administered as a salt of a complex of gadolinium with DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentacetate) with the chemical formula A2Gd(DTPA)(H2O); when cation A is the protonated form of the amino sugar meglumine the salt goes under the name [...] "gadopentetate dimeglumine". It was described in 1981 and introduced as the first MRI contrast agent in 1987. It is used to assist imaging of blood vessels and of inflamed or diseased tissue where the blood vessels become [...] "leaky". It is often used when viewing intracranial lesions with abnormal vascularity or abnormalities in the blood-brain barrier. It is usually injected intravenously. Gd-DTPA is classed as an acyclic, ionic gadolinium contrast medium. Its paramagnetic property reduces the T1 relaxation time (and to some extent the T2 and T2* relaxation times) in NMR, which is the source of its clinical utility.|$|E

40|$|KML 001 is sodium metaarsenite, and {{has shown}} {{cytotoxic}} activity in human tumor cell lines. The anti-cancer mechanism of KML 001 involves cancer cell destruction due to DNA damage at the telomeres of cancer cell chromosomes. In this study, we assessed the vascular disrupting properties of KML 001 and investigated whether KML 001 as VDA {{is able to}} increase anti-tumor activity in irinotecan combined treatment. We used a murine model of the CT 26 colon carcinoma cell line. CT 26 isograft mice treated intraperitoneally with 10 mg/kg KML 001 displayed extensive central necrosis of tumor by 24 h. The vascular disrupting effects of KML 001 were assessed by dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging. <b>Gadopentetic</b> acid-diethylene triaminepentaacetic <b>acid</b> contrast enhancement was markedly decreased in KML 001 -treated mice one day after treatment, whereas persistently high signal enhancement was observed in mice injected with saline. Rate constant K(ep) value representing capillary permeability was significantly decreased (p< 0. 05) in mice treated with KML 001. Cytoskeletal changes of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with 10 uM KML 001 were assessed by immune blotting and confocal imaging. KML 001 degraded tubulin protein in HUVECs, which {{may be related to}} vascular disrupting properties of KML 001. Finally, in the mouse CT 26 isograft model, KML 001 combined with irinotecan significantly delayed tumor growth as compared to control and irinotecan alone. These results suggest that KML 001 is a novel vascular disrupting agent, which exhibits significant vascular shut-down activity and enhances anti-tumor activity in combination with chemotherapy. These data further suggest an avenue for effective combination therapy in treating solid tumors...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate the risk for analytical interferencewith gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) for the colorimetric measurement of serum iron (Fe 3 +) and to investigate the mechanisms involved. Materials and Methods: Rat serum was spiked with several concentrations of all molecular categories of GBCAs, ligands, or ‘‘free’ ’ soluble gadolinium (Gd 3 +). Serum iron concentration was determined by 2 different colorimetric methods at pH 4. 0 (with a Vitros DT 60 analyzer or a Cobas Integra 400 an-alyzer). Secondly, the cause of interference was investigated by (a) adding free soluble Gd 3 + orMn 2 + to serum in the presence of gadobenic acid or gadodiamide and (b) electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Results: Spurious decrease in serum Fe 3 + concentration was observed with all linear GBCAs (only with the Vitros DT 60 technique occurring at pH 4. 0) but not with macrocyclic GBCAs or with free soluble Gd 3 +. Spurious hyposideremia was also observed with the free ligands present in the pharmaceutical solutions of the linear GBCAs <b>gadopentetic</b> <b>acid</b> and gadodiamide (ie, diethylene triamin...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) diagnostic methods, including sensitive and specific biomarkers and computed tomography (CT) /magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technologies, and therapeutic strategies, such as surgical resection techniques and local ablation methods, {{have increased the}} 5 -year survival rate of HCC to 63. 4 %. However, early diagnosis remains a clinical challenge in China, and only 20 %~ 30 % of cases are suitable for surgical resection upon diagnosis. To improve early diagnosis rates, screening for serum tumor markers should be increased, along with more frequent ultrasound examinations of high-risk individuals, such as those infected with hepatitis virus. In addition, the high-risk populations should be evaluated by more powerful imaging technologies, such as the three-phase dynamic contrast-enhanced CT and the <b>gadopentetic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gd-DTPA) contrast-enhanced MRI. Upon diagnosis, several aspects of patient management should be enhanced to promote better outcome; specifically, a multidisciplinary consultation approach should be developed to help the patient understand the disease process and healthcare providers to develop effective individualized treatment programs. Collectively, improvements in early diagnosis and patient management will not only help to reduce the rate of late-stage hepatic failure but also improve the overall survival of HCC patients...|$|E
40|$|Brain metastases are an {{important}} clinical problem. Few animal models exist for melanoma brain metastases; {{many of which are}} not clinically relevant. Longitudinal MRI was implemented to examine the development of tumors in a clinically relevant mouse model of melanoma brain metastases. Fifty thousand human metastatic melanoma (A 2058) cells were injected intracardially into nude mice. Three Tesla MRI was performed using a custom-built gradient insert coil and a mouse solenoid head coil. Imaging was performed on consecutive days at four time points. Tumor burden and volumes of metastases were measured from balanced steady-state free precession image data. Metastases with a disrupted blood-tumor barrier were identified from T 1 -weighted spin echo images acquired after administration of <b>gadopentetic</b> <b>acid</b> (Gd-DTPA). Metastases permeable to Gd-DTPA showed signal enhancement. The number of enhancing metastases was determined by comparing balanced steady-state free precession images with T 1 -weighted spin echo images. After the final imaging session, ex-vivo permeability and histological analyses were carried out. Imaging showed that both enhancing and nonenhancing brain metastases coexist in the brain, and that most metastases switched from the nonenhancing to the enhancing phenotype. Small numbers of brain metastases were enhancing when first detected by MRI and remained enhancing, whereas other metastases remained nonenhancing to Gd-DTPA throughout the experiment. No clear relationship existed between the permeability of brain metastases and size, brain location and age. Longitudinal in-vivo MRI is key to studying the complex and dynamic processes of metastasis and changes in the blood-tumor barrier permeability, which may lead {{to a better understanding of}} the variable responses of brain metastases to treatments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Cerebral sparganosis in {{children}} {{is an extremely}} rare disease of central nervous system, and caused by a tapeworm larva from the genus of Spirometra. In this study, we discussed and summarized epidemiological, clinical and MR imaging characteristics of eighteen children with cerebral sparganosis for a better {{diagnosis and treatment of}} the disease. Methods Eighteen children with cerebral sparganosis verified by pathology, serological tests and MR presentations were retrospectively investigated, and the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of the disease were studied. Results Twenty-seven lesions were found in the eighteen children. Twelve lesions in twelve patients were solitary while the lesions in the rest six patients were multiple and asymmetrical. The positions of the lesions were: seven in frontal, eleven in parietal, four in temporal and two in occipital lobes, one in basal ganglia, one in cerebella hemisphere and one in pons. The lesions were presented as slight hypointensity on T 1 -weighted images but moderate hyperintensity on T 2 -weighted images with perilesional brain parenchyma edema. Enhanced MR scans by using <b>Gadopentetic</b> <b>Acid</b> Dimeglumine Salt were performed in the patients, and the images demonstrated abnormal enhancements with the patterns of a peripheral ring, or a tortuous beaded, or a serpiginous tubular shape. Follow-up MR scans were preformed for eight patients, and three out of the eight cases exposed migrations and changes in shapes of the lesion areas. Conclusions The MR presentations in our study in general were similar to those in previous studies. However serpiginous tubular and comma-shaped enhancements of lesions have not been previously reported. The enhanced MR imaging and follow-up MR scans with the positive results from serological tests are the most important methods for the clinical diagnosis of cerebral sparganosis {{in children}}. </p...|$|E
