60|$|Now, on a {{somewhat}} nearer approach, the precipice did not belie its purple promise from the manorial piazza--that sweet imposing purple promise, which seemed fully to vindicate the Bunyanish old title originally bestowed;--but showed the profuse aerial foliage of a hanging forest. Nevertheless, coming still more nigh, long and frequent rents among {{the mass of}} leaves revealed horrible glimpses of dark-dripping rocks, and mysterious mouths of wolfish caves. Struck by this most unanticipated view, the tourist now quickened his impulsive steps to verify the change by coming into direct contact with so chameleon a height. As he would now speed on, the lower ground, which from the manor-house piazza seemed all a grassy level, suddenly merged into a very long and weary acclivity, slowly rising close up to the precipice's base; so that the <b>efflorescent</b> grasses rippled against it, as the <b>efflorescent</b> waves of some great swell or long rolling billow ripple against the water-line of a steep gigantic war-ship on the sea. And, as among the rolling sea-like sands of Egypt, disordered rows of broken Sphinxes lead to the Cheopian pyramid itself; so this long acclivity was thickly strewn with enormous rocky masses, grotesque in shape, and with wonderful features on them, which seemed to express that slumbering intelligence visible in some recumbent beasts--beasts whose intelligence seems struck dumb in them by some sorrowful and inexplicable spell. Nevertheless, round and round those still enchanted rocks, hard by their utmost rims, and in among their cunning crevices, the misanthropic hill-scaling goat nibbled his sweetest food; for the rocks, so barren in themselves, distilled a subtile moisture, which fed with greenness all things that grew about their igneous marge.|$|E

60|$|But {{as every}} effect is but {{the cause of}} another and a {{subsequent}} one, so it now happened that finding themselves thus clannishly, and not altogether infelicitously entitled, the occupants of the venerable church began to come together out of their various dens, in more social communion; attracted toward each other by a title common to all. By-and-by, from this, they went further; and insensibly, at last became organized in a peculiar society, which, though exceedingly inconspicuous, and hardly perceptible in its public demonstrations, was still secretly suspected to have some mysterious ulterior object, vaguely connected with the absolute overturning of Church and State, and the hasty and premature advance of some unknown great political and religious Millennium. Still, though some zealous conservatives and devotees of morals, several times left warning at the police-office, to keep a wary eye on the old church; and though, indeed, sometimes an officer would look up inquiringly at the suspicious narrow window-slits in the lofty tower; yet, to say the truth, was the place, to all appearance, a very quiet and decorous one, and its occupants a company of harmless people, whose greatest reproach was <b>efflorescent</b> coats and crack-crowned hats all podding in the sun.|$|E

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Science, University of the Witwatersrand in fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science, Johannesburg, August, 2014. <b>Efflorescent</b> minerals are a common feature of the soil surface in seasonal environments where evapotranspiration (ET) exceeds precipitation (P), and are formed by the evaporation of salt solutions from the soil during periods of drying. On the Highveld gold fields, ET exceeds rainfall by approximately two-and-a-half times during the dry season, and soils overlying acid mine drainage and along polluted stream banks can become covered by distinctively coloured mineral <b>efflorescent</b> crusts. Whereas some <b>efflorescent</b> minerals are relatively insoluble and present a negligible environmental hazard (for example, gypsum), others may be readily soluble and contain high concentrations of potentially toxic metals (for example, copiapite, jarosite and uranyl sulphate). During periods of rainfall, such salts are washed further afield and into surface water bodies and act as sources of episodic pollution. The presence of some <b>efflorescent</b> minerals can be detected from their characteristic reflectance signatures using remote-sensing (RS) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The species of <b>efflorescent</b> minerals present is a useful indication of the spatial extent of sub-surface contamination, and also of the chemical conditions of the substrate, in particular the concentration of total dissolved solids, pH and redox conditions. The {{aim of this study}} was therefore to assess the use of remote-sensing on indicator <b>efflorescent</b> minerals as a cost-effective aid in the spatial mapping of acid rock-drainage polluted soils and water-bodies. This study describes the range of <b>efflorescent</b> crusts identified on different land-use areas and soil classes in a Highveld gold-mining region. Crusts were first measured in-situ under natural sunlight using a portable analytical spectral radiometer (ASD) as well as using X-ray diffraction (XRD). They were then dissolved in deionized water and the resulting salt solutions allowed to evaporate prior to analysis under controlled lighting conditions. Spectra were post-processed and compared with iv geological spectral reference libraries. The salt solutions were also analyzed for metal and sulphate content and the results were used to establish evaporation models from which mineral precipitation could be predicted. Minerals identified in the visible near-infra red (VNIR) region included iron oxides (hematite and goethite), and the sulphate mineral jarosite. In the short wave infra-red (SWIR) region clay minerals of the smectite group were dominant. Gypsum and Al-Mn-Mg-Na sulphate salts were identified in the SWIR region as mixtures occurring with clay minerals. Minerals identified in the VNIR-SWIR region were all confirmed by X-Ray diffraction (XRD). Upon dissolution, geochemical modeling revealed that gypsum and jarosite are the most common minerals expected to precipitate. The precipitation of gypsum and jarosite indicates persistent acidic conditions after dissolution of mineral salts. Gypsum and jarosite were also accurately identified by hyper-spectral spectroscopy and confirmed by XRD and geochemical modeling. Agreement between spectral interpreted minerals and geochemically precipitated mineral phases demonstrated the ability of hyper-spectral data in detecting efflorescence minerals on the soil surface. Using partial least squares regression (PLSR) combined with bootstrapping, reflectance spectrum was significantly correlated with geochemical variables...|$|E

Halotrichite was observed and the EDX analyses showed the mineral to be a mixture of heinrichite and pickingerite.

40|$|Greenhouse pot {{experiments}} were conducted over 13 months {{to evaluate the}} effect of two amendment mixture doses (30 and 75 Mg/ha) on the geochemical dispersion of trace elements by leaching hazardous mine wastes from the Sao Domingos mine. Mineralogical evolution of these materials was also evaluated. Amendment mixtures containing solid wastes from agriculture (plant remains + strawberry substrate and rocicwool used for the strawberry crop) and from distillation of Ceratonia siliqua Land Arbutus unedo L fruits were used to improve the chemical characteristics of leachates from sulfide mine wastes. Sulfide mine wastes had acidic characteristics, as well as high electrical conductivity and total element concentrations (g/kg; AI: 54. 8 - 612; Fe: 104. 0 - 110. 0; Pb: 9. 0 - 13. 8; S: 63. 6 - 68. 0; As: approximate to 1). These features contributed to the large capacity for leaching of hazardous elements during, at least, {{the first four months}} of incubation. In the seventh month of incubation, there was a significant decrease in the leachate concentration of the majority of hazardous elements. The addition of amendments minimised trace element dispersion in leachate percolation during the first seven months (25 to 99 % reduction compared to control, depending on the element and sampling period). However, the leachate characteristics were not influenced by amendment doses and no significant differences were observed in leachate composition (control and amended treatments) after 13 months. Amendment application led to differences between the solid phases of the <b>efflorescent</b> salts formed {{on the surface of the}} control and the amended treatments. The <b>efflorescent</b> salts contained very soluble aluminium sulfates, together with alunite-jarosite-group solid phases in amended samples, and copiapite-group solid phases in control. In the core materials (5 to 10 cm in depth), the mineralogy was similar in both control and amended samples. The presence of various stable solid phases from alunite-jarosite-group, such as jarosite and beudantite (mainly in deeper materials), can explain the low concentrations of trace elements in the leachates after thirteen months.
