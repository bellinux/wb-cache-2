5|$|In 1961, {{with its}} first {{location}} in Skokie, Illinois, Burger King Corporation and its franchises began opening stores and by 1967 had over 20 locations {{spread throughout the}} state. The Hootses, claiming that their trademark gave them <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the name in Illinois sued BK in the state, and later federal, courts under the case Burger King of Florida, Inc. v. Hoots 403 F.2d 904 (7th Cir. 1968). The decision issued by United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois, and upheld by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, stated that the BK federal trademark, applied for in 1961 and granted in 1963, took precedence over the Hootses' older, state trademark; The Court granted the Hootses <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the Burger King trademark within a circular area defined with a 20-mile (32km) radius centered on their original location.|$|E

50|$|Copyright is {{traditionally}} {{understood as a}} statutorily defined bundle of <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> provided <b>to</b> copyright holders. An infringement of copyright takes place when someone exercises {{one or more of}} the copyright holder’s <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> without his or her permission. Anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions do not fit under this paradigm of a bundle of <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights.</b> On one hand, a copyright owner has the <b>exclusive</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> copy his or her work, and that <b>exclusive</b> <b>right</b> is infringed when someone else copies the work without permission. It is quite another story, however, to think about copyright holders having the <b>exclusive</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> circumvent TPMs (Technical Protection Measure) that they apply to their works, and the <b>exclusive</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> make and distribute devices that enable or facilitate circumvention of TPMs. Even assuming that this problem could be overcome, attempting to force anti-circumvention and anti-device provisions to fit the mold of the bundle of <b>rights</b> paradigm seems <b>to</b> necessitate adding a number of related <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> the bundle, including the <b>exclusive</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> apply a TPM to a copyright work.|$|R

5|$|Farsari sold many {{of these}} {{photograph}} albums, particularly to foreign residents and visitors. He employed excellent artists who each produced high-quality work at a pace {{of two or three}} hand-coloured prints per day. Farsari ensured that the colours were true to life and that the best materials were used. Accordingly, his work was expensive, yet popular and often praised by clients and visitors to Japan, even receiving a glowing reference by Rudyard Kipling following his 1889 visit to Yokohama. That same year, Farsari presented a deluxe photograph album to the King of Italy. By the 1890s, the studio's high reputation earned it <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> photograph the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the music video, a 45-minute {{documentary}} was released that provided candid glimpses behind the scenes of the music video's production.

5|$|Hatfield Moors is {{the site}} of a {{depleted}} onshore natural gas field located at a depth of 1450 feet (440 metres) below Hatfield Moor. The field was discovered in 1981 and contained about 8.5 billion cubic feet (241 million cubic metres) of gas in two formations Hatfield Moors and Hatfield West. Production of gas started in 1986, and it was operated and owned by Edinburgh Oil & Gas plc. As the field became depleted plans were made by ScottishPower in 1998 to develop the field for the storage of gas. These facilities became operational in February 2000. Edinburgh Oil and Gas have a 25-year agreement with ScottishPower giving them <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> inject, store and withdraw gas.|$|E

Lourim had Cassidy's written permission to release the album, and eventually the cover was changed to look like the original LP album while already released copies were affixed with a sticker indicating that they are not solo Eva Cassidy albums.|$|E

He decided that Universal's earnings from it were too low {{and that the}} license's granting of <b>exclusive</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> Tiger would impede the agreement with Coleco. On May 4, Sheinberg sent Tiger a mailgram demanding that they send their game in for further approval. Universal reviewed it and decided that King Kong was too similar to Donkey Kong. On May 8, Steinberg revoked Tiger's license, but Tiger president O. R. Rissman refused to give in and challenged Universal's claim that it owned the King Kong name.|$|E

5|$|Svalbard was {{undoubtedly}} spotted by Willem Barentsz of the Netherlands in 1596, {{although it may}} have previously have been discovered by Norsemen or Pomors. The Muscovy Company of England started walrus hunting on Bjørnøya in 1604, and from 1611 the company's Jonas Poole started whaling around Spitsbergen. The following year the Muscovy Company sent a new expedition, but was met by both Dutch and Spanish whalers.
