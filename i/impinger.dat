This automated factory replaced the original one, which operated out of Favona Road (behind Progressive Enterprises Head Office). The new facility was designed to support the continued local and international expansion of the brand. It was capable of producing more than 6,000 pies per hour. The pies were snap frozen (in a spiral freezer) in a raw state and distributed to stores, where they were freshly baked using <b>impinger</b> (conveyor) ovens.

50|$|An <b>impinger</b> {{system is}} a device in which {{particles}} are removed by impacting the aerosol particles into a liquid. Modular media type units combine a variety of specific filter modules in one unit. These systems can provide solutions to many air contaminant problems. A typical system incorporates a series of disposable or cleanable pre-filters, a disposable vee-bag or cartridge filter. HEPA or carbon final filter modules can also be added. Various models are available, including free-hanging or ducted installations, vertical or horizontal mounting, and fixed or portable configurations. Filter cartridges are made out {{of a variety of}} synthetic fibers and are capable of collecting sub-micrometre particles without creating an excessive pressure drop in the system. Filter cartridges require periodic cleaning.|$|E

The project involves both experimental and modeling efforts. The team is comprised of the University of Utah, Reaction Engineering International, and the University of Connecticut. The objective is to determine the experimental parameters of importance in the homogeneous and heterogeneous oxidation reactions; validate models; and, improve existing models. Parameters to be studied include HCl, NO{sub x}, and SO{sub 2 } concentrations, ash constituents, and temperature. This report summarizes Year 3 results for the experimental and modeling tasks. Experiments have been completed on the effects of chlorine. However, the experiments with sulfur dioxide and NO, in the presence of water, suggest that the wet-chemistry analysis system, namely the <b>impingers,</b> is possibly giving erroneous results. Future work will investigate this further and determine the role of reactions in the <b>impingers</b> on the oxidation results.

40|$|In {{the present}} study a {{sampling}} and analysis method for arsenic emissions during pyrolysis of arsenic containing wood, such as chromated copper arsenate (CCA) treated wood, has been developed. The procedure {{is based on the}} NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) standard for arsenic trioxide sampling. Validation for this specific application is needed since pyrolysis of arsenic containing wood leads to a gas stream containing sticky tar compounds and aerosols. Validation was carried out through tube furnace experiments using both CCA treated wood and arsenic trioxide powder as input. The outlet of the tube furnace was coupled to a cooling section and sampling train. The sampling train consisted of one or more filter sections and <b>impingers.</b> Different combinations of filters (untreated or impregnated) and <b>impingers,</b> as well as different combinations of washing solutions were tested. The different units of the sampling train were analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) {{in order to determine the}} distribution of arsenic over the different units. For the working conditions considered (pyrolysis at 350 degreesC for 20 minutes with a nitrogen flow rate of 100 Nl h(- 1)) the combination of a quartz cooling tube and a cellulose ester membrane filter impregnated with a Na 2 CO 3 -glycerol solution was sufficient to capture the arsenic. Two extra <b>impingers</b> (the first one containing 50 ml HNO 3 1 M in the case of CCA treated wood and 50 ml NaOH 0. 1 M in the case of As 2 O 3 and the second one containing 50 ml NaOH 0. 1 M) were added downstream of the filter section as backup either in case of filter failure or to check whether all the arsenic released is captured by the cooling tube and filter. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{assessment}} {{data collected}} in two prior occupational hygiene studies of swine barns and sawmills allowed {{the comparison of}} concurrent, triplicate, side-by-side endotoxin measurements using air sampling filters and bioaerosol impingers. Endotoxin concentrations in <b>impinger</b> solutions and filter eluates were assayed using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay. In sawmills, <b>impinger</b> sampling yielded significantly higher endotoxin concentration measurements and lower variances than filter sampling with IOM inhalable dust samplers. Analysis of variance for repeated measures showed that this association remained after controlling for other factors such as replicate, sawmill, sawmill operation, wood type, and interaction terms. Endotoxin concentrations in the swine barns were 10 -fold higher on average than in sawmills. These samples demonstrated comparable endotoxin concentration estimates for <b>impinger</b> and filter methods although the variability was lower using the <b>impinger</b> method. In both occupational settings, side-by-side replicates were more uniform for the <b>impinger</b> samples than for the filter samples. This study demonstrates that <b>impinger</b> sampling is an acceptable method for quantitation of area endotoxin concentrations. Further, when sampling is performed with impingers for airborne microorganism quantitation, these same <b>impinger</b> solutions can yield valid endotoxin exposure estimates, negating {{the need for additional}} filter sampling...|$|E
30|$|The major {{advantage}} of collecting airborne isocyanates by impingers {{is the large}} sampling capacity (Henneken et al. 2007). The method utilizes a large excess of the derivatisation agent, generating favourable kinetics for the derivatisation reaction and virtually quantitative recovery (Henneken et al. 2007). However, airborne particles could be pass through the <b>impinger</b> in air bubbles, and escape from the trapping solution. In particular, the <b>impinger</b> method does not efficiently wash all the particles between 0.01 and 1.5  μm. For the collection of airborne particles, in-line chemically treated filters coupled in series after the <b>impinger,</b> as an impinger-filter system, are usually used (Karlsson et al. 2000; BSI Standards Publication 2013; Health and Safety Executive HSE 2014; Creely et al. 2006). The advantages of sampling airborne isocyanates by <b>impinger</b> is the simple set-up {{as well as the}} large sampling capacity and efficiency. However, the <b>impinger</b> sampling is impractical for personal air sampling, i.e. when investigating the exposure of workers by attaching a sampling device on their person. Additionally, during prolonged sampling with an <b>impinger,</b> the solvent containing the derivatisation agent could evaporate.|$|E

40|$|Ammonia in {{mainstream}} smoke {{is present in}} both the particulate and vapor phases. The presence of ammonia in the cigarette filler material and smoke is of significance {{because of the potential}} role ammonia could have in raising the "smoke pH. " An increased smoke pH could shift a fraction of total nicotine to free-base nicotine, which is reportedly more rapidly absorbed by the smoker. Methods measuring ammonia in smoke typically employ acid filled <b>impingers</b> to trap the smoke. We developed a fast, reliable method to measure ammonia {{in mainstream}} smoke without the use of costly and time consuming <b>impingers</b> to examine differences in ammonia delivery. The method uses both a Cambridge filter pad and a Tedlar bag to capture particulate and vapor phases of the smoke. We quantified ammonia levels in the mainstream smoke of 50 cigarette brands from 5 manufacturers. Ammonia levels ranged from approximately 1 to 23 per cigarette for ISO smoking conditions and 38 to 67 per cigarette for Canadian intense smoking conditions and statistically significance differences were observed between brands and manufacturers. Our findings suggest that ammonia levels vary by brand and are higher under Canadian intense smoking conditions. 27415766 PMC 494494...|$|R
40|$|Liquid <b>impingers,</b> filter papers, and fritted bubblers were partial viable {{collectors}} of radioactive submicron T 1 bacteriophage aerosols at 30, 55, and 85 % relative humidity. Sampler differences for viable collection {{were due to}} incomplete physical collection (slippage) and killing of phage by the samplers. Dynamic aerosols of a mass median diameter of 0. 2 μ were produced with a Dautrebande generator from concentrated aqueous purified phage suspensions containing extracellular soluble radioactive phosphate as a physical tracer. There was considerable destruction of phage by the Dautrebande generator; phage titers of the Dautrebande suspension decreased exponentially, {{but there was a}} progressive (linear) increase in tracer titers. Liquid <b>impingers</b> recovered the most viable phage but allowed considerable (30 to 48 %) slippage, which varies inversely with the aerosol relative humidity. Filter papers were virtually complete physical {{collectors of}} submicron particles but were the most destructive. Fritted bubbler slippage was more than 80 %. With all samplers, phage kill was highest at 85 % relative humidity and lowest at 55 % relative humidity.

Bacterial survival subsequent to aerosolization of P. syringae and E. herbicola was not impaired 1 m {{from the site of}} release. P. syringae aerosolized at 3 to 15 m from the site of release at a temperature of 12 degrees C and a relative humidity of 80 % survived 35 - to 65 -fold better than P. syringae released at 27 degrees C and a relative humidity of 40 %. No difference was observed in the survival of P. syringae and E. herbicola following aerosolization at the same temperature and relative humidity. Bacteria sprayed directly onto bean and oat plants established stable populations at comparable numbers on both plants over an 8 -day period following inoculation. Bacteria that inoculated adjacent plants by drifting downwind up to 5 m were detectable at an initial population of 10 (2) CFU/g on oats and 10 (5) CFU/g on beans 2 h after the spray.

40|$|The extreme {{particle}} size range and enormous heterogeneity of airborne biological particles make sampling a significant challenge. Three major sampler types available include gravity devices, impactors and suction samplers. Gravity methods, while most commonly used, are neither qualitatively or quantitatively accurate and of very limited use.

Particles are collected from measured volumes of air but these devices preferentially sample particles larger than 10 [mu]m. Suction samplers, which efficiently collect particles of a wide size range from measured volumes of air, include slit samplers, cascade impactors, filtration devices and liquid impingers.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{simple and}} {{sensitive}} method for simultaneous determination of furan and vinyl acetate (VA) in vapor phase of mainstream cigarette smoke with cold trap and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was developed. A Cambridge filter pad (CFP) {{was placed in}} front of the <b>impingers</b> of smoking machine to remove the particle phase from cigarette smoke. Furan and VA in vapor phase of mainstream cigarette smoke were collected in two <b>impingers</b> connected in series by filled with methanol at - 78 °C. The solutions were added with deuterium-labeled furan-d 4 and VA-d 6 as internal standards and analyzed by GC-MS. The results showed that the calibration curves for furan and VA were linear (r 2 > 0. 9995) over the studied concentration range. The intra- and inter-day precision values for furan and VA were < 7. 07 % and < 9. 62 %, respectively. The extraction recoveries of furan and VA were in the range of 94. 5 - 97. 7 % and 92. 3 - 94. 9 %, respectively. Moreover, the limits of detection for furan and VA were 0. 028 µg mL- 1 and 1. 3 ng mL- 1, respectively.

40|$|Scientific {{investigators}} {{who are interested}} in the various facets of airborne transmission of disease in research laboratories and hospitals need a simple, continuous, high-volume sampling device that will recover a high percentage of viable microorganisms from the atmosphere. Such a device must sample a large quantity of air.

A simple multi-slit <b>impinger</b> sampler that fulfills these requirements has been developed.

This study compares four methods {{for the detection}} and enumeration of aerosolized bacteria collected in an AGI- 30 <b>impinger.</b> Changes in the total and viable concentrations of Pseudomonas fluorescens in the collection fluid with respect to time of impingement were determined. Two direct microscopic methods (acridine orange and BacLight) and aerodynamic aerosol-size spectrometry (Aerosizer) were employed to measure the total bacterial cell concentrations in the <b>impinger</b> collection fluid and the air, respectively. These data were compared with plate counts on selective (MacConkey agar) and nonselective (Trypticase soy agar) media, and the percentages of culturable cells in the collection fluid and the bacterial injury response to the impingement process were determined'. The bacterial collection rate {{was found to be}} relatively unchanged during 60 min of impingement. The aerosol measurements indicated an increased amount of cell fragments upstream of the <b>impinger</b> due to continuous bacterial nebulization. Some of the bacterial clusters, present in the air upstream of the <b>impinger,</b> deagglomerated during impingement, thus increasing the total bacterial count by both direct microscopic methods. The BacLight staining technique was also used to determine the changes in viable bacterial concentration during the impingement process. The percentage of viable bacteria, determined as a ratio of BacLight live to total counts was only 20 % after 60 min of sampling. High counts on Trypticase soy agar indicated that most of the injured cells could recover. On the other hand, the counts from the MacConkey agar were very low, indicating that most of the cells were structurally damaged in the <b>impinger.</b> The comparison of data on the percentage of injured bacteria obtained by the traditional plate count with the data on percentage of nonviable bacteria obtained by the BacLight method showed good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Health effects {{resulting}} from dust inhalation in occupational environments {{may be more}} strongly associated with specific microbial components, such as fungi, than to the particles. The aim {{of the present study}} is to characterize the occupational exposure to the fungal burden in four different occupational settings (two feed industries, one poultry and one waste sorting industry), presenting results from two air sampling methods – the <b>impinger</b> collector and the use of filters. In addition, the equipment used for the filter sampling method allowed a more accurate characterization regarding the dimension of the collected fungal particles (less than 2. 5 μm size). Air samples of 300 L were collected using the <b>impinger</b> Coriolis μ air sampler. Simultaneously, the aerosol monitor (DustTrak II model 8532, TSI®) allowed assessing viable microbiological material below the 2. 5 μm size. After sampling, filters were immersed in 300 mL of sterilized distilled water and agitated for 30 min at 100 rpm. 150 μl from the sterilized distilled water were subsequently spread onto malt extract agar (2 %) with chloramphenicol (0. 05 g/L). All plates were incubated at 27. 5 ºC during 5 – 7 days. With the <b>impinger</b> method, the fungal load ranged from 0 to 413 CFU. m- 3 and with the filter method, ranged from 0 to 64 CFU. m- 3. In one feed industry, Penicillium genus was the most frequently found genus (66. 7 %) using the <b>impinger</b> method and three more fungi species/genera/complex were found. The filter assay allowed the detection of only two species/genera/complex in the same industry. In the other feed industry, Cladosporium sp. was the most found (33. 3 %) with <b>impinger</b> method and three more species/genera/complex were also found. Through the filter assay four fungi species/genera/complex were found. In the assessed poultry, Rhyzopus sp. was the most frequently detected (61. 2 %) and more three species/genera/complex were isolated. Through the filter assay, only two fungal species/genera/complex were found. In the waste sorting industry Penicillium sp. was the most prevalent (73. 6 %) with the <b>impinger</b> method, being isolated two more different fungi species/genera/complex. Through the filter assay only Penicillium sp. was found. A more precise determination of occupational fungal exposure was ensured, since it was possible to obtain information regarding not only the characterization of fungal contamination (<b>impinger</b> method), but also the size of dust particles, and viable fungal particles, that can reach the worker ́s respiratory tract (filters method).

The aim {{of the present study was}} to quantify the recovery efficiency of culturable B. thailandensis from several common aerosol sampling devices to ensure that collected microorganisms could be reliably recovered post-collection. The sampling devices tested included 25 -mm gelatin filters, 25 -mm stainless steel disks used in Mercer cascade impactors, and two types of glass <b>impingers.</b> The results demonstrate that while several processing methods tested resulted in significantly lower physical recovery efficiencies than other methods, it was possible to obtain culturable recovery efficiencies for B. thailandensis and physical recovery efficiencies for 1 μm fluorescent spheres of at least 0. 95 from all of the sampling media tested given an appropriate sample processing procedure. The results of the present study also demonstrated that the bubbling action of liquid media in all-glass <b>impingers</b> (AGIs) can result in physical loss of material from the collection medium, although additional studies are needed to verify the exact mechanisms involved. Overall, the results of this study demonstrate that the collection mechanism as well as the post-collection processing method can significantly affect the recovery from and retention of culturable microorganisms in sampling media, potentially affecting the calculated airborne concentration and any subsequent estimations of risk or dose derived from such data...|$|R

Real-time capabilities of the instrument were used to investigate the effect of on-farm-activities, such as an effluent flushing with recycled water, on microbial load inside the SCB. In addition to the UVAPS, {{monitoring of}} viable bioaerosols (bacteria and fungi) was simultaneously conducted with the sixstage Andersen microbial impactor and the AGI- 30 <b>impingers.</b> The UVAPS measurements showed that the concentrations of both total and biological particles inside the SCB were in order of 106 - 107 particles/ m 3. These concentrations were approximately seven times the outside concentrations for total particles and up to 12 times for biological particles. Approximately 95 % of both total and biological particles were respirable (< 7 mm) and approximately 60 % of total and 50 % of biological particles accounted for the fine particle fraction (< 2. 5 mm).

During sampling periods of 120 – 300 min, the <b>impinger</b> retained the cultivability, metabolic activity, viability, and ice-nucleation activity of investigated bacteria. Field studies in semiurban, high-altitude, and polar environments included periods of low bacterial air concentrations, thus demonstrating {{the benefits of the}} impinger’s high flow rate. In conclusion, the <b>impinger</b> described here has many advantages compared with other bioaerosol samplers currently on the market: a potential for long sampling time, a high flow rate, a high sampling and retention efficiency, low costs, and applicability for diverse downstream microbiological and molecular analyses...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this paper was the identification and quantification of various chemical forms of mercury in coal flue gas. To this end, bench-scale evaluations were carried out on the Ontario-Hydro Method to determine its capability to selectively isolate and retain various mercury species captured from flue gas streams containing moderate to high levels of sulfur dioxide (SO{sub 2 }). Loss of mercury from the oxidized mercury capture solutions through chemical reduction by sulfur dioxide has been documented previously from both bench- and pilot- scale studies. Results from recent studies, giving further verification of this phenomenon with emphasis on optimization of sampling conditions to minimize this impediment to effective mercury speciation, are presented. All speciation methods utilizing <b>impinger</b> trains were configured in a similar manner. The impingers immediately down-stream of the heated sampling probe and filter box contained solutions intended to capture oxidized (ionic) mercury while impingers further down-stream of these contained acidic potassium pennanganate (KMnO{sub 4 }). These latter solutions, having been shown by the EPA in their Method 101 A validation studies to capture all forms of mercury, were utilized here to capture the remaining elemental mercury. The challenge was to develop, test and validate an oxidized mercury capture solution that would effectively capture and retain all of the oxidized mercury species while allowing 100 % of the elemental mercury to pass through it and be captured down- stream in the KMnO{sub 4 } <b>impinger</b> solutions. A schematic of the <b>impinger</b> train utilized in the Ontario-Hydro Method is shown in Figure 1. For oxidized mercury capture, this method utilizes a 1. 0 molar potassium chloride (KCI) <b>impinger</b> solution, which we have shown to be effective in its ability to retain mercuric chloride solution spikes given the appropriate sampling conditions...|$|E
40|$|A {{gasification}} {{plant was}} designed and built to test syngas production from biomass for electricity generation on microscale. The plant is mainly composed by a downdraft reactor, a gas cleaning section with a cyclone and a wet scrubber, a blower for syngas extraction and an ICE (Internal Combustion Engine, Lombardini LGA 340), equipped with an alternator. A small quantity of producer was also eventually sent to a button cell SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) for preliminary characterization. The plant was tested in a preliminary experimental campaign to evaluate mass and energy balances and process efficiency. Woody biomass was used and the producer gas firstly passed through <b>impingers</b> bottles, to condense and measure tar concentration (according to CEN/TS 15439), and then the remaining uncondensed gas was analyzed with a micro-GC (Gas Chromatograph). The paper presents and discusses {{the results of the}} preliminary tests carried out...|$|R

Nor sole the gulls in cloud that wheeled Circling one snow-flanked peak afar, But nearer fowl the floes that skimmed And crystal beaches, felt no jar. No thrill {{transmitted}} stirred the lock Of jack-straw needle-ice at base; Towers undermined by waves--the block Atilt impending--kept their place. Seals, dozing sleek on sliddery ledges Slipt never, when by loftier edges Through very inertia overthrown, The impetuous ship in bafflement went down. Hard Berg (methought), so cold, so vast, With mortal damps self-overcast; Exhaling still thy dankish breath-- Adrift dissolving, bound for death; Though lumpish thou, a lumbering one-- A lumbering lubbard loitering slow, <b>Impingers</b> rue thee and go down, Sounding thy precipice below, Nor stir the slimy slug that sprawls Along thy dense stolidity of walls.|$|R
40|$|The {{electronic}} cigarette solvents propylene glycol and glycerol {{are known to}} produce toxic byproducts such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein. However, the aerosol toxin yield depends upon a variety of chemical and physical variables. The formaldehyde hemiacetals derived from these solvents were reported as major {{electronic cigarette}} aerosol components by us in 2015. In the study described herein, the formaldehyde hemiacetals were found at higher levels than those of free formaldehyde via an orthogonal sample collection protocol. In addition, the common aldehyde collection methods for electronic cigarettes, such as <b>impingers</b> and sorbent tubes containing DNPH, significantly underestimate the levels of formaldehyde. The {{reason for this is}} that formaldehyde hemiacetals follow other reaction pathways, such as the formation of a less reactive full cyclic acetal catalyzed by the acidity of the DNPH solution and the silica. We found that formaldehyde hemiacetals are a considerable fraction of the total formaldehyde produced in electronic cigarette that cannot be determined accurately by DNPH derivatization methods. Although the health effects of the hemiacetals are not yet known, they warrant further investigation...|$|R
