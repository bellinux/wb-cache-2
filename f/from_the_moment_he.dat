25|$|In the Prelude to Dune novels, D'murr and C'tair Pilru (twin sons of Ambassador Cammar Pilru of Ix) {{take the}} initial {{examination}} to become Navigators, but only D'murr passes. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> enters training, D'murr is told {{he will never}} communicate with his family again; he eventually becomes a full Navigator.|$|E
25|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> {{takes the}} dog, Coco's luck begins to change. People {{ask him to}} guard {{buildings}} with the dog; a chance meeting with the bank manager leads him to Walter, a trainer. Walter assures him that the dog is pure gold. After the dog wins third prize at a dog show an eager Walter begins to make arrangements to have him put out to stud, this promises to be lucrative for them both, but the dog is unable to perform.|$|E

25|$|In a {{scene in}} a bar, the {{character}} of Paul Marrane tells Gloria {{the tale of a}} soldier who goes off to war, first giving his wife a bill of divorce that becomes official if he doesn’t return within 12 months, but then retroactively takes effect <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> left; should he not return, this would mean that she would have been divorced during the last 12 months, despite the fact she had spent those months married to that very same man. This is a paradox and a contradiction to the law of noncontradiction.|$|E
25|$|Pelé's arrival {{created a}} media {{sensation}} and overnight transformed {{the fortunes of}} soccer in the United States. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> signed his contract at the 21 Club on June 10, 1975 {{in front of a}} crush of ecstatic worldwide media, Pelé's every move was followed, bringing attention and credibility to soccer in America. The New York Cosmos' home attendance tripled in just half the season Pelé was there, and on the road the Cosmos also played in front of huge crowds that came to watch Pelé play.|$|E
25|$|Bryant's {{motivation}} for the massacre remains a closely guarded secret, known only to his lawyer, who is bound not to reveal confidences without his client's consent. The lawyer later released a book outlining that Bryant was motivated largely by the media reports of the then-recent Dunblane school massacre. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> was captured, he continually {{wanted to know how}} many people he had killed and seemed impressed by the number. Bryant is only allowed to listen to music on a radio outside his cell, and is denied access to any news reports of his massacre. Photographers allowed in to take pictures of him in his prison cell were forced to destroy the film in his presence when the Governor found out.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} week Jimmy was frightfully embarrassed, and to his natural bronze was added an almost {{continuous}} flush of mortification <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> that <b>he</b> entered <b>the</b> department {{in the morning until}} he left it at night.|$|R

25|$|Napoleon had {{undoubtedly}} {{gained the}} victory <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> succeeded in penetrating the Prussian centre; {{but it was}} not distinguished by that brilliant success, or by those immediate and decisive advantages, which might have been anticipated from the admirable manner in which the attack had been prepared, and the care with which it was concealed from the Prussians, at a moment when they had no reserve remaining, and when the co-operation of Wellington's army on their right, or the arrival of IV Corps (Bülow's) from Hannut, had become quite impracticable. This appears the more surprising when we reflect that he had a considerable corps of cavalry under Grouchy at hand to support this attack, and that the whole of IV Corps (Lobau's) was on the field, fully prepared for active operations.|$|E
25|$|In March 1943, the Japanese {{command in}} Burma had been reorganised. A new headquarters, Burma Area Army, was created under Lieutenant-General Masakazu Kawabe. One of its {{subordinate}} formations, {{responsible for the}} central part of the front facing Imphal and Assam, was the Fifteenth Army. Lieutenant-General Renya Mutaguchi was appointed to command this army in July 1943. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> took command, Mutaguchi forcefully advocated an invasion of India. His motives for doing so appear to be complex. He had played a major part in several Japanese victories, ever since the Marco Polo Bridge incident in 1937, and believed it was his destiny to win the decisive battle of the war for Japan. He may also have been goaded by the first Chindit expedition, a raid behind Japanese lines launched by the British under Orde Wingate early in 1943. The Allies had widely publicised the successful aspects of Wingate's expedition while concealing their losses to disease and exhaustion, possibly misleading Mutaguchi and some of his staff as to the difficulties they would later face.|$|E
25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey just stood there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some believe that if Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Sutton found {{inspiration}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> internet [...] "where apparently {{people say}} that every time you masturbate God kills a kitten". From that statement, he developed a comic piece about [...] "a young man's emotions and feelings, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he's</b> a baby tugging at his cock onwards." [...] In August 2003, he performed the one-man Killing Kittens show at Edinburgh's Underbelly. Sutton followed up Killing Kittens with a second autobiographical show Pandora's Lunchbox in 2006. Following an acclaimed performance as William Blake in Peter Ackroyd's BBC television series The Romantics, Sutton joined the cast of Albion Rising at St. Giles in the Fields Church, London, in April 2007.|$|R

25|$|Tiffany, Pat, {{and their}} friends and family arrive at the {{competition}} {{on the night of}} the football game. Tiffany despairs when she finds that Nikki actually is in the audience, invited by Ronnie and Veronica who want Nikki to lift her restraining order on Pat and give Pat the chance to reconcile with her. Tiffany walks to the bar and starts drinking. Pat finds her moments before their dance and drags her onto the dance floor. They begin their routine as the Eagles defeat the Dallas Cowboys. At the conclusion of their set, Tiffany and Pat score exactly 5 points. Amid cheers from friends and family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat approaches Nikki and speaks quietly into her ear. Tiffany sees this and runs off. Pat leaves Nikki behind after a short conversation, and chases Tiffany. He hands her a letter, in which he admits that he knows she forged Nikki's letter and confesses that he loved her <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> met her, though it took him so long to come to terms with it. They share a kiss. Patrizio opens a restaurant with the money he has won, Danny grows even closer to the Solitanos, and Pat and Tiffany begin a relationship, no longer wearing their wedding rings.|$|E
500|$|Chris Campling in The Times wrote {{a review}} of a show {{recorded}} in Skipton: [...] "A tough gig? More like shooting fish in a barrel, to judge from the reception he received from the honest burghers of Skipton, North Yorkshire. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> remarked {{on the fact that}} the hall in which he was performing was used as a cattle market during the day and was hosed out before the show – and got a roar of approving laughter – Steel must have known that he could do no wrong." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} the album {{is the story of}} the [...] "Imperfect Man", <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> is born to the day of his death. RCA {{originally}} released the singles [...] "Yesterday's Wine" [...] and [...] "Me and Paul". The former peaked at number 62 in Billboards Hot Country Singles. The full release failed to reach the charts, and Nelson, frustrated by the failure, decided to retire from music without having been released from his contract with RCA. Later with his musical style revitalized, he returned to music in 1972.|$|E

500|$|The {{trial of}} {{eight of the}} {{plotters}} began on Monday 27 January 1606. [...] Fawkes shared the barge from the Tower to Westminster Hall with seven of his co-conspirators. [...] They were kept in the Star Chamber before being taken to Westminster Hall, where they were displayed on a purpose-built scaffold. [...] The King and his close family, watching in secret, were among the spectators as the Lords Commissioners read out the list of charges. [...] Fawkes was identified as Guido Fawkes, [...] "otherwise called Guido Johnson". [...] He pleaded not guilty, despite his apparent acceptance of guilt <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> was captured.|$|E
500|$|In the Summer of 2003, Limp Bizkit participated on the Summer Sanitarium Tour, headlined by Metallica. At the tour's stop in Chicago, {{attendees}} of {{the concert}} threw items and heckled Durst <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> walked on stage. With the crowd chanting [...] "Fuck Fred Durst" [...] and continuing their assault on him, Durst threw the mic down after six songs and walked off stage, but not before heckling the crowd back. He repeatedly said, [...] "Limp Bizkit are the best band in the world!" [...] until a roadie took his microphone away. An article in the Sun-Times stated that the hostility was started by radio personality Mancow.|$|E
500|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> was nominated, McKinley was {{beset by}} {{supporters}} coming to Canton to hail him, hoping {{to hear him}} give a political speech. McKinley remained in Canton, {{available to the public}} every day but Sunday, continuously from his June nomination until Election Day in November, excepting one trip in July to give previously arranged nonpolitical speeches in Cleveland and at Mount Union College. He also took one weekend of rest in late August. The need to greet and speak to supporters made it difficult for McKinley to get campaign work done; one political club interrupted his conference with Hobart in late June. [...] McKinley complained that his time was not being well managed.|$|E

60|$|He wanted {{very much}} to dance with Gudrun. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> first <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> had seen her, {{he wanted to make}} a {{connection}} with her.

500|$|Constance {{joined the}} hippie {{movement}} and encouraged her sons {{to get involved}} in the arts. Leto became interested in percussions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> and his brother started playing music together at early age, and his models were artists of many different mediums. [...] "I come from a pretty artistic family," [...] he explained, [...] "There were canvases and paint everywhere, instruments, and all sorts of stuff. It just kind of made sense. I started playing on pots and pans at a very early age, so I just kind of flowed into it. It was just a natural progression." [...] He received his first drum kit when he was ten years old and began teaching himself, developing his own style.|$|E
500|$|The novel follows three {{interwoven}} storylines. [...] The first {{concerns a}} woman, Urania Cabral, who {{is back in}} the Dominican Republic, after a long absence, to visit her ailing father; she ends up recalling incidents from her youth and recounting a long-held secret to her aunt and cousins. The second story line focuses on the last day in Trujillo's life <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> wakes up onwards, and shows us the regime's inner circle, to which Urania's father once belonged. The third strand depicts Trujillo's assassins, many of whom had previously been government loyalists, as they wait for his car late that night; after the assassination, this story line shows us the assassins' persecution. Each aspect of the book's plot reveals a different viewpoint on the Dominican Republic's political and social environment, past and present.|$|E
500|$|After {{giving advice}} to Liz, Tracy and Jenna spend the episode calling {{themselves}} [...] "The Problem Solvers" [...] giving the TGS crew advice on their lives. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>he</b> arrives, Danny treats NBC page Kenneth Parcell politely {{and does not}} ask him to run any errands for him, a break from how Tracy and Jenna treat him. Danny explains to the two that lower-level people such as pages often rise up to positions {{where they would be}} the boss of actors such as themselves, and as a result, he is polite to avoid building bad relationships with potential future bosses. Danny even speculates that Kenneth could be running the network someday. Jenna initially dismisses the idea out-of-hand, but Tracy becomes concerned, and tells Kenneth that he doesn't want him to perform any more menial tasks for him; Jenna soon joins him. Meanwhile, Kenneth lets slip that he may have been alive forever. Kenneth becomes upset that he is losing his responsibilities and confronts Danny, driving him to yell at Kenneth. Danny, who is Canadian, has had a hard time pronouncing the word [...] "about", but after yelling at Kenneth, and saying [...] "about" [...] without his Canadian accent, thanks Kenneth for helping him.|$|E
