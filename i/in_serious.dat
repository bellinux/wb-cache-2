5|$|American {{football}} {{in the early}} 1900s had become increasingly violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed and pulled up the field by his own players in massive formations that often resulted <b>in</b> <b>serious</b> injuries. In 1905, 18 deaths, three at the college level, were attributed to football; 159 serious injuries were also reported, 88 at the college level.|$|E

5|$|Some pugs {{are also}} born with {{stenotic}} nares {{which can also}} inhibit their breathing. <b>In</b> <b>serious</b> cases, the pinched nostrils make breathing even more difficult for this breed and put added pressure on the larynx.

5|$|A {{doctor at}} Shanghai's Jing'an Hospital said that over 20 people {{injured in the}} fire had been admitted, many {{suffering}} from asphyxia caused by smoke inhalation.

According to BBC News, people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November, 66 wounded people, 14 of which were in critical condition, were being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire.|$|E
5|$|Although strenuous and {{requiring}} physical fitness, {{none of the}} conventional routes require specialist mountaineering skills or technical rock climbing. The main dangers of the mountain are those common to all high mountains, particularly altitude sickness. This can affect anyone, {{even those who are}} acclimatized. <b>In</b> <b>serious</b> cases, it can lead to high-altitude pulmonary edema and cerebral edema, which can lead to difficulties with breathing, paralysis, and death. Climbers are advised to begin their ascent at or before 6 a.m. and to summit and descend before early afternoon to minimize exposure to possible afternoon thunderstorms while at high altitudes. Although the most conventional form of ascent is by hiking, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson, the orator, ascended the mountain on a mule borrowed from the U.S. government.|$|E

5|$|Bufotenin, {{one of the}} {{chemicals}} excreted by the cane toad, is classified as a class-1 drug under Australian law, alongside heroin and cannabis.

5|$|By 1986, {{the company}} was once again <b>in</b> <b>serious</b> {{financial}} trouble. During 1985 they had taken the show outside Quebec to a lukewarm response.

5|$|By {{the time}} Musidora was exhibited, Etty's health was <b>in</b> <b>serious</b> decline. Suffering severe asthma, {{it was not}} unusual for passers-by to accuse him of {{drunkenness}} {{as he made his way}} wheezing through the London streets, and he was beginning to plan his retirement from polluted London to his beloved York. Abandoning the smaller paintings which kept him profitable, he strived to complete his Joan of Arc triptych before his health gave out. This was on a huge scale, 28ft (8.5m) in total width and 9ft 9in (3m) high; the three pictures from left to right depicted Joan devoting herself to the service of God and her country, Joan scattering the enemies of France, and Joan dying a martyr.|$|E

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting a vicious circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion.

5|$|Chopin {{has figured}} {{extensively}} in Polish literature, both <b>in</b> <b>serious</b> critical studies {{of his life}} and music and in fictional treatments. The earliest manifestation was probably an 1830 sonnet on Chopin by Leon Ulrich. French writers on Chopin (apart from Sand) have included Marcel Proust and André Gide; and he has also featured in works of Gottfried Benn and Boris Pasternak. There are numerous biographies of Chopin in English (see bibliography for some of these).|$|E
