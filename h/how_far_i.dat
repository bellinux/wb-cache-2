500|$|American Pharoah had {{the lead}} {{within the first}} quarter-mile and was {{challenged}} by Mr. Z early on, but held the lead on the inside throughout the race. He was challenged by Dortmund and then Divining Rod, but American Pharoah broke from the pack in the homestretch and won by seven lengths, as Tale of Verve made a strong rally to overtake Divining Rod to place. Firing Line slipped badly at the start and was eased in the stretch. The winning time was 1:58.45. Espinoza did not use his whip {{at all in the}} Preakness, and stated, [...] "I couldn't see <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>I</b> was in front because there was so much water in my eyes." [...] The margin of victory was tied for the sixth-largest in Preakness history. The win by American Pharoah set up an attempt for the Triple Crown for the second straight year. It was also the second straight year that Espinoza had won both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and the jockey's third time winning both races. [...] For Baffert, it was the fourth time in 19 years that he won the first two Triple Crown races. Of the colt, Baffert said, [...] "He brought his A-game today." ...|$|E
500|$|The overall standings did {{not change}} until stage 12, on Bastille Day, which ended with the hors catégorie climb to Luz Ardiden. Voeckler {{finished}} ninth on the day, ceding 20 seconds {{to most of the}} race's top overall riders, but still had sufficient time in hand to remain race leader by nearly two minutes. Rolland finished at his side for tenth on the day. Voeckler had said the night before that he expected to lose the jersey on this stage. After the peloton mostly stayed together in stage 13, popular expectation for stage 14, including two first-category climbs on course and another hors catégorie climb at the finish (Plateau de Beille), again was for Voeckler to lose the jersey. But he not only retained the jersey, he also finished with the main group of overall favorites, losing time to only three riders and actually putting time into other riders such as Damiano Cunego and Tom Danielson. Voeckler himself again expressed his surprise at his successes, saying [...] "I was very surprised to be with the best riders up the Plateau de Beille climb. I don't know <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>I</b> can go." [...] Stage 16 ended with a lengthy descent, from the second-category Col de Manse. Voeckler lost time to nearly all the race's top riders, and expressed after the stage his certainty that he could not win the Tour, but he remained race leader.|$|E

On 5November, {{he was involved in}} a collision at Kiriwina Airfield with a Spitfire of No.79 Squadron. The Spitfire pilot was killed, and Arthur received serious burns. He later recalled, [...] "...I felt my hands disappear, felt my face go but the rest of my body was...was just flames...And {{then all of a sudden}} the flames dropped down a bit and I got out and went like mad and I was running away from the aircraft and trying to guess <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>I</b> could go before I'd try to put the flames out..." [...] Although his family was informed that his injuries were [...] "of a very slight nature" [...] and that he had been [...] "burnt but not badly", Arthur was close to death for weeks while he was treated in Kiriwina. [...] He was finally repatriated to Sydney where he underwent plastic surgery at Yaralla Military Hospital (now Concord Hospital). After his recovery in April 1944, he attended a staff course before taking over command of No.2 Operational Training Unit at Mildura, Victoria.

2500|$|In a June 2003 interview, Maida {{explained}} that lyrically, his {{words on the}} album would follow the music and would be very much {{a product of the}} times. [...] "I think it's {{going to be a little}} more raw, a little bit more in your face, not a lot of relationship stuff," [...] he says, noting that fans would get a preview of a couple of the tracks, [...] "Wipe That Smile Off Your Face" [...] and [...] "Walking In Circles", on the current tour. [...] "My head, with what's going on in the world and being able to reflect on all the (stuff) that I've done in the last few years in terms of going to Iraq, working very closely with War Child, I'm in that mode. I'm not angry, but kind of frustrated." [...] After observing the plight in Sudan and Darfur, Maida returned with a different outlook on his lyrics and became more outspoken. “There were some [...] that were way too over the top and preachy,” he admits, “and I had to pull a lot of stuff back. This isn’t a solo record for me, this is Our Lady Peace, so I have three people that I contend with in terms of <b>how</b> <b>far</b> <b>I</b> can go with saying things.” Bassist Coutts added [...] "A lot of things he was talking about lyrically were things that we discussed as a band in spending all that time together. I also think that becoming a father also let him deal with issues that he hadn't dealt with before. Although there are some of the darkest lyrics ever on this record, I think there are also some very positive ones as well." [...] The content of the album's lyrics have led it to be classified as a politically charged album, which the band hasn't denied.|$|E
