25|$|In the Bayesian (or epistemological) interpretation, {{probability}} measures a “degree of belief.” Bayes’ theorem then {{links the}} <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> in a proposition {{before and after}} accounting for evidence. For example, suppose it is believed with 50% certainty that a coin is {{twice as likely to}} land heads than tails. If the coin is flipped a number of times and the outcomes observed, that <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> may rise, fall or remain the same depending on the results.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the many}} {{applications}} of Bayes' theorem is Bayesian inference, a particular approach to statistical inference. When applied, the probabilities involved in Bayes' theorem may have different probability interpretations. With the Bayesian probability interpretation the theorem expresses how a subjective <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> should rationally change to account for availability of related evidence. Bayesian inference is fundamental to Bayesian statistics.|$|E
25|$|Bayes {{methods are}} more cost {{effective}} than the traditional frequentist take on marketing research and subsequent decision making. The probability can be assessed from a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> before and after accounting for evidence, instead of calculating the probabilities of a certain decision by carrying out {{a large number of}} trials with each one producing an outcome from a set of possible outcomes. The planning and implementation of trials to see how a decision impacts in the ‘field’ e.g. observing consumers reaction to a relabeling of a product, is time consuming and costly, a method many firms cannot afford. In place of taking the frequentist route in aiming for a universally acceptable conclusion through iteration, it is sometimes more effective to take advantage of all the information available to the firm to work out the ‘best’ decision at the time, and then subsequently when new knowledge is obtained, revise the posterior distribution to be then used as the prior, thus the inferences continue to logically contribute to one another based on Bayes theorem.|$|E

Choices can be rational. So can beliefs. But {{what is the relationship between}} rational choice and rational belief? I will argue that rational choice imposes an evidentiary constraint on the beliefs that inform decision-making, and that Bayesian decision theory violates this constraint. We need a modified decision theory. Our actions are more likely to be successful if the beliefs they are based on are true. A rational agent should want to reason in a way that leads to true <b>belief.</b> Talk <b>of</b> 'true belief', however, should not be taken literally here.
