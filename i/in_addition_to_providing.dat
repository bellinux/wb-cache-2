The CN rail tracks were converted to allow for the storage of more subway trains as the T-1 series trains were shifted from Yonge–University–Spadina line to the Bloor–Danforth line. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> storage for subway trains, the Greenwood yard is also used to maintain vehicles, which operate on Line 3 Scarborough as the McCowan RT Yard is only equipped for vehicle storage and to perform basic maintenance of vehicles.|$|E

In 1723, Welsh Tract settlers pushed for the road to be improved.

5|$|Harrison quickly saw the {{enactment}} of the Dependent and Disability Pension Act in 1890, a cause he had championed while in Congress. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> pensions to disabled Civil War veterans (regardless of the cause of their disability), the Act depleted some of the troublesome federal budget surplus. Pension expenditures reached $135million under Harrison, the largest expenditure of its kind to that point in American history, a problem exacerbated by Pension Bureau commissioner James R. Tanner's expansive interpretation of the pension laws. An investigation into the Pension Bureau by Harrison's Secretary of Interior John W. Noble found evidence of lavish and illegal handouts under Tanner. Harrison, who privately believed that appointing Tanner had been a mistake, due to his apparent loose management style and tongue, asked Tanner to resign and replaced him with Green B. Raum. Raum was also accused of accepting loan payments in return for expediting pension cases. Harrison, having accepted a dissenting Congressional Republican investigation report that exonerated Raum, kept him in office {{for the rest of his}} administration.|$|E

From the experimental results, we can know that the problems in traditional recommender systems can be alleviated clearly through the repeating pattern-based recommendation.|$|R
5|$|Obstacles for the {{proposal}} include the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, {{the lack of}} electrification on the line, and the single-tracking {{in some parts of}} the line. The current iteration of the plan would have its northern terminus be Co-Op City South using the Hells Gate Branch. The LIRR Bay Ridge Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad have freight operating along them, and are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FRA rules require a certain distance between freight and passenger trains that share rights-of-way, and as a result it is uncertain whether the right-of-way is wide enough or if more durable train cars are needed to be able to share the same tracks. The RPA's 2015 plan considered having FRA compliant light rail vehicles run over the line. <b>In</b> <b>addition</b> <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> transfer opportunities, the line would provide transit access to areas without it in Glendale and Middle Village in Queens, and in Flatlands and Canarsie in Brooklyn.|$|E

His first hat-trick with the Albicelestes came in a friendly against Switzerland on 29 February 2012, followed by two more hat-tricks over the next year-and-a-half in friendlies against Brazil and Guatemala.
