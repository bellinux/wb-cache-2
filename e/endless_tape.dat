50|$|Loop {{recording}} is {{the process}} of recording audio continuously to an <b>endless</b> <b>tape</b> (if magnetic tape is used) or to computer memory, or recording video feeds (such as from video surveillance or camera signals) on a video server. This process is a never-ending one: {{at the end of the}} internal disk drive, the recording process continues to record at the beginning, erasing the previously recorded material and replacing it with the new content.|$|E
50|$|Laffing Sal was {{a fixture}} at the Balboa Fun Zone in Newport Beach, California {{when it opened}} in 1936. Decades later, the park's {{management}} learned that Funni-Frite Inc. of Pickerington, Ohio still had the original molds of Laffing Sal's head and hands, and commissioned them to make an updated Sal to stand above the entrance of their Scary Dark Ride. An <b>endless</b> <b>tape</b> cartridge provided its audio. The figure was removed when the attraction was closed in 2005.|$|E
6000|$|We {{know not}} what tears were shed {{in the vast}} and silent halls of Chanticlere, when the company were gone, and the four cooks, and four maids, six footmen, and {{temporary}} butler had driven back in their private trap to the metropolis, which is not forty miles distant from that splendid castle. How can we tell? The guests departed, the lodge-gates shut; all is mystery:--darkness with one pair of wax candles blinking dismally in a solitary chamber; all the rest dreary vistas of brown hollands, rolled Turkey carpets, gaunt ancestors on the walls scowling out of the twilight blank. The imagination is at liberty to depict his lordship, with one candle, over his dreadful <b>endless</b> <b>tapes</b> and papers; her ladyship with the other, and an old, old novel, wherein perhaps, Mrs. Radcliffe describes a castle as dreary as her own; and poor little Clara sighing and crying {{in the midst of}} these funereal splendours, as lonely and heart-sick as Oriana in her moated grange:--poor little Clara! ...|$|R
50|$|Most modern {{answering}} machines have {{a system}} for greeting. The owner may record a message that will be played back to the caller, or an automatic message will be played if the owner does not record one.

5000|$|The <b>endless</b> loop <b>tape</b> {{cartridge}} {{was first}} designed in 1952 by Bernard Cousino around a single reel carrying a continuous loop of standard 1/4-inch, plastic, oxide-coated recording tape running at 3.75 in per second. Program starts and stops were signaled by a one-inch-long metal foil that activates the track-change sensor. (Bill Lear {{had tried to}} create an endless-loop wire recorder in the 1940s, but gave up in 1946. He would be inspired by Earl Muntz's four-track design in the early 1960s.) ...|$|R
5000|$|In essence, a Turing {{machine is}} {{imagined}} to {{be a simple}} computer that reads and writes symbols {{one at a time}} on an <b>endless</b> <b>tape</b> by strictly following a set of rules.

50|$|Rowe Customusic is a {{background}} music {{system for the}} 1960s and 1970s. The playback machine can load up to six Fidelipac type C endless magnetic tape cartridges, which could hold the longest tape of its kind. Like the 3M Cantata 700, the playback machine moves the tape head in between the cartridges, and also usual for Fidelipac playback machines, track by track on the current cartridge, to access each to the four tracks per cartridge. The current cartridge number is indicated on a seven-segment display. Changing to the next track was triggered automatically by a conductive tape strip where the <b>endless</b> <b>tape</b> joined its both ends, or even manually by pressing a key to move the tape head to the next track. An other switch located next to the main switch disables changing the cartridge an make the player remain the playback procedure on the current cartridge.|$|E
40|$|Alkaline {{fuel cells}} have the {{opportunity}} of becoming important for mobile energy systems as, in contrast to other low temperature fuel cells, the alkaline type requires neither expensive noble metal catalysts nor an expensive polymer electrolyte [1]. In alkaline fuel cells (AFC) silver {{can be used as}} cathode catalyst in gas diffusion electrodes. The metal catalyst was mixed with polytetraflourethylene (PTFE) as organic binder in a knife mill and rolled onto a metal web in a calandar to prepare the gas diffusion electrodes. The electrodes are manufactured as an <b>endless</b> <b>tape</b> with a thickness of approx. 0. 4 mm and widths up to 20 cm. As catalyst Raney-silver, carbon supported silver or silver deposited as a closed film on PTFE are used. The silver catalyst is frequently used in an oxidized form. In the preparation process of the gas diffusion electrodes the silver catalyst can be used in this oxidized form. Before using the gas diffusion silver cathodes in the alkaline fuel cell the catalyst will be reduced to the metallic form. The silver oxide in the gas diffusion electrodes is reduced galvanostatically at approx. 7 mA/cm 2 with measurement of the potential. The reduction process is finished if the electrode potential is in the region of the hydrogen generation potential. In the chrono-potential curves the oxide states of silver yield a plateau; from the integration of the charging current the silver loading in the electrodes can be calculated. During the reduction process the dark electrodes turn bright. The electrodes are characterized electrochemically in half cells and physical by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). With V-i-curves the electrochemical performance is investigated. The XP spectra give information about the chemical composition of the electrodes. By successive measurements of XP spectra and ion etching of the surface depth profiles are recorded. ...|$|E

5000|$|Advertisements, jingles, and the top-of-hour station {{identification}} {{required by law}} were often on [...] "carts". Short for cartridges, these were <b>endless</b> <b>tapes</b> similar to 4-track tapes, were mechanically identical as well, and were called Fidelipacs. The primary difference between carts and 4 track is two fold. The Cart had only two tracks and the 4-track (obviously) had four. The Cart ran at 7 and 1/2 IPS whereas the 4-Track ran at 3 and 3/4 IPS. Carts had a slot for a pinch roller on a spindle which was activated by solenoid upon pressing the start button on the cart machine. The capstan was spinning at full speed and this allowed for nearly instantaneous playback start without artifacts. Mechanical carousels would rotate the carts {{in and out of}} multiple tape players as dictated by the computer. Time announcements were provided by a pair of dedicated cart players, with the even minutes stored on one and the odd minutes on the other. This meant an announcement would always be ready to play, even if the minute was changing when the announcement was triggered. The system did require attention throughout the day to change reels as they ran out and reload carts. It became obsolete when a method was developed to automatically rewind and re-cue the reel tapes when they ran out, extending 'walk-away' time indefinitely.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} written during my visit in Japan {{supported}} by the "Research for the Future" Program, JSPS-RFTF 96 I 00101 of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science. Proc. of Bio-Computing and Emergent Comp., World Scientific, 146 - 164 2 wheel once every time it revolved, the result being {{that it had to}} make ten revolutions in order to completely turn the 10 -teeth wheel once. Later on, Charles Babbage (1812) theorized, but never built, a fully-automatic steam driven calculating machine. In 1823 he envisioned a better idea, of an "analytical engine" that would have conditional control and where the instructions were to be stored on punched cards. The introduction in 1890 of the punched cards by Herman Hollerith, whose firm later became International Business Machine (IBM), marked the transition from the decimal system to the binary system. The binary system had two states, 0 and 1, corresponding to the place in the card having or not a hole punched in to it. The binary representation could take advantage of many two-state devices like card readers, electric circuits (on/off states) and vacuum tubes, and it led to the next stage in the evolution of computing: the electronic one. The theoretical foundation of modern electronic computers was laid by Alan Turing who described in 1936, [58], a hypothetical device that became known as a Turing machine. A Turing machine can read, write and erase symbols written on squares of an infinite tape. Its <b>endless</b> <b>tape</b> can be interpreted as a general purpose internal memory, on which operations of read, write and erase are performed as in any modern day RAM. The first high-speed electronic digital computer was the ENIAC (Electrical Numerical Integrator and Calculator), which used almost 18, 000 vacuum tubes stored on 167 square meter [...] ...|$|E
50|$|The {{professional}} broadcast cart format {{survived for}} more than another decade at most radio stations. It was used to play and switch jingles, advertisements, station identifications, and music content until it was replaced by various computer-based methods in the 1990s. This format survived longer because it was used for relatively short sound loops, where starting from the beginning {{was more important than}} other criteria. The <b>endless</b> loop <b>tape</b> concept continues to be used in modern movie projectors, although in that application the spool is actively rotated and not drawn by tension on the film. That too, however, is being supplanted by digital cinema technologies.|$|R
50|$|Farmer's launch is {{delayed by}} <b>endless</b> red <b>tape</b> created by U.S. {{government}} {{officials from the}} FAA, FBI, CIA, NASA and the Department of Defense, who seek to stall him beyond his deadline and force his creditors to foreclose on the farm. Farmer was counting on publicity to help him financially. He is denied the hydrazine fuel he requires, with government officials claiming he is a security risk {{and that it is}} too dangerous to allow a private citizen to launch a space vehicle. Facing financial ruin, he panics, climbs aboard, and, using a less-than-optimal substitute fuel, he somehow launches the rocket. However, after only a foot or two of vertical lift, the rocket descends back down, falls over, and horizontally blasts out of the old wooden barn where it was constructed.|$|R
40|$|Peeling is a {{physical}} mechanics involved in the detachment of many natural and industrial applications. In this paper, we investigate the double peeling of an <b>endless</b> elastic pre-stressed <b>tape</b> adhering to a flat smooth rigid substrate.

However, when a pre-stress is high, tapes behave differently and may spontaneously detach from the rigid substrate...|$|R
50|$|The <b>endless</b> loop <b>tape</b> {{cartridge}} {{was designed}} in 1952 by Bernard Cousino of Toledo, Ohio, around a single reel carrying a continuous loop of standard ¼ inch plastic oxide-coated recording tape running at 3¾ inches/second (9.5 cm/s). Program starts and stops were signalled either by a conductive foil splice or sub-audible tones. The tape was {{pulled from the}} center of the reel, passed across the opening at the end of the cartridge and wound back onto the outside of the same reel. The spool itself was freewheeling and the tape was driven only by tension from the capstan. George Eash, also of Toledo, an inventor who had rented space in Cousino's building in the 1950s, later revised Cousino's design (1954, receiving a patent in January 1957) and marketed it under the name Fidelipac. These cartridges were first used in radio stations (broadcast cartridges) from 1959 on to program commercials and single song hits.|$|R

5000|$|On another occasion, Trurl and Klapaucius are {{captured}} by an interstellar [...] "PHT" [...] pirate.

However, the pirate {{turns out to have}} a PhD and cares not for the riches, but for knowledge (and in fact points out that gold becomes cheap if it is abundant). Trurl therefore makes a modified Maxwell's demon for him, an entity that looks at moving particles of gas and reads information that is, coincidentally, encoded in their random perturbations. This way, all the information in the universe becomes easily available. The demon prints out this information on a long paper tape, but before the pirate realizes most of the information is completely useless (although strictly factual) he is buried under the <b>endless</b> rolls of <b>tape,</b> ceasing to bother anyone.|$|R
50|$|Formed by Nergal during mid-1991, Behemoth {{release their}} first record {{a year later}} with the {{rehearsal}} <b>tape</b> <b>Endless</b> Damnation, followed by the 1993's demos The Return of the Northern Moon, and …From the Pagan Vastlands. Later that year, Behemoth sign with the Italian independent record label, Entropy and release the EP And the Forests Dream Eternally in 1994, followed by the debut full-length, 1995's Sventevith (Storming Near the Baltic). Behemoth sign a deal with Solistitium Records, and released their second studio album, Grom in 1996. The third album, titled Pandemonic Incantations was released in 1998, the first with drummer Inferno. Later that year the group sign a record deal with label Avantgarde Music—the first album released was Satanica in 1999, followed by 2000's Thelema.6, and Zos Kia Cultus (Here and Beyond), issued in 2002. Behemoth signed a deal with Swedish label Regain Records in 2003, and later that year two members joined the band; bassist Orion, along with session guitarist Seth. With this new line-up they released Demigod in 2004, followed by 2007's The Apostasy, the first ever Behemoth album that did chart, peaked at number 149 on the US Billboard.|$|R
40|$|Music {{has changed}} and evolved through time and time tells that {{it has always been}} for the better. In our study, we have {{implemented}} Genetic Algorithms for the generation of music by music mixing to provide willing music lovers, the first step to personalize music to suit their liking. A music loop library, containing a list of all tentative loops which are {{to be used in the}} remix production alongwith the parameters which define them, is used for this purpose. A loop is an <b>endless</b> band of <b>tape</b> or music allowing continuous repetition. These loops cover all the major music instrument families with particular emphasis on Indian musical instruments as they have been extracted from Indian songs after careful observation using a sound editor. The combinations of different loops for the analysis is run through genetic algorithms. Some important parameters of a loop from the point of view of music mixing are:Depth, BPM (beats per minute), length of the loop and type of the instrument. A fitness function is calculated for the genetic algorithm to rank various combinations of loops for the next generation. The best loop combination can be selected out of the final set of population...|$|R
30|$|Something similar {{happens in}} CA, where the analyst {{has to make}} a choice among the <b>endless</b> hours of <b>taped</b> (and transcribed) {{conversation}} that are at his or her disposal. Here I want to emphasize, first, that the transcription itself is not a fact of speech, but an artifact of history: no two transcriptions are the same, no matter how hard one tries to standardize the conventions. But even more important is the way of selecting the material {{to be used in the}} analysis. This is by no mean an irrelevant or trivial matter: just as the skillful defense lawyer can select and arrange the facts of the case so as to picture the events in a way that is most favorable to his client, so too the conversation analyst ‘proves’ his or her point by selectively choosing among the raw material of transcribed speech. In the case of film making, one could say (varying the old proverb, C’est le ton qui fait la musique) that ‘it is the cutting that makes the movie’; similarly, in CA, it’s the selection that makes the analysis. In both cases, we have to take the cutter, respectively the analyst into account; their voices can never be entirely subdued. While pretending to objectively describe and neutrally analyze the historical event of a conversation, what conversation analysis produces is not history, but a story, neither more nor less.|$|R
40|$|The project aims the {{automatic}} production of rotational symmetrical components of thermoplastic fiber reinforced materials {{for use of}} three-dimensional structural components. Concepts for positioning of <b>endless</b> fiber reinforced <b>tapes,</b> or fiber placement are investigated. Tapes reinforced with carbon fiber or fiber glass are immersed in a polymer matrix system and are rolled up in coils. A tape-laying unit which includes all the necessary functions for handling the prepreg tape was developed. The tape-laying unit is mounted onto a robot system. This creates the tape-laying movements. In order to produce a highly compact fiber reinforced component via laser-assisted tape-laying, the tapes are deposited, layer by layer, into a mold. During the process, a laser melts the upper side of the fresh tape and the lower side of the previously deposited tape. The tapes are then deposited side by side, without gaps, and compressed by a pressure roller {{in order to make}} the fiber reinforced component compact. The first results of trials show that the carbon fiber best absorbs radiation from a high-performance diode laser. In the course of future development work, a system must be designed to secure the first tape to the mold. Subsequent layers can then be melted onto the bottom layer. This innovative machining process will be able to flexibly and cost effectively produce three-dimensional lightweight components. The project ultimately aims to introduce fiber reinforced materials into new fields of industry and technology. Entnommen aus TEMA</a...|$|R
