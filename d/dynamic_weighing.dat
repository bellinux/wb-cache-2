There is lack of data, however, regarding the accuracy of such weighing systems mounted on harvesting machinery, especially on that used to collect high value crops such as fruits and vegetables. Certainly, <b>dynamic</b> <b>weighing</b> systems mounted on the bins of grape harvesters {{are affected by the}} displacement of the load inside the bin when moving over terrain of changing topography. In this work, the load that would be registered in a grape harvester bin by a <b>dynamic</b> <b>weighing</b> system based on the use of a load cell was inferred by using the discrete element method (DEM).

Results obtained from these models were used to infer the output given by the load cell of a real bin. The mass detected by the load cell when the bin was inclined depended strongly on the distribution of the load within the bin, but was underestimated in all scenarios. The distribution of the load was found to be dependent on the inclination of the bin caused by the topography of the terrain, but also by the history of inclination (inclination rate, presence of static periods, etc.) since the effect of the inertia of the particles (i. e., representing the grapes) was not negligible.

40|$|Knowledge of {{the mass}} of the {{manipulated}} load (i. e. payload) in off-highway machines is useful information {{for a variety of reasons}} ranging from knowledge of machine stability to ensuring compliance with transportion regulations. This knowledge is difficult to ascertain however. This dissertation concerns itself with delineating the motivations for, and difficulties in development of a <b>dynamic</b> payload <b>weighing</b> algorithm. The dissertation will describe how the new type of <b>dynamic</b> payload <b>weighing</b> algorithm was developed and progressively overcame some of these difficulties. The payload mass estimate is dependent upon many different variables within the off-highway vehicle. These variables include static variability such as machining tolerances of the revolute joints in the linkage, mass of the linkage members, etc as well as dynamic variability such as whole-machine accelerations, hydraulic cylinder friction, pin joint friction, etc. Some initial effort was undertaken to understand the static variables in this problem first by studying the effects of machining tolerances on the working linkage kinematics in a four-wheel-drive loader. This effort showed that if the linkage members were machined within the tolerances prescribed by the design of the linkage components, the tolerance stack-up of the machining variability had very little impact on overall linkage kinematics. Once some of the static dependent variables were understood in greater detail significant effort was undertaken to understand and compensate for the dynamic dependent variables of the estimation problem. The first algorithm took a simple approach of using the kinematic linkage model coupled with hydraulic cylinder pressure information to calculate a payload estimate directly. This algorithm did not account for many of the aforementioned dynamic variables (joint friction, machine acceleration, etc) but was computationally expedient. This work however produced payload estimates with error far greater than the 1 % full scale value being targeted. Since this initial simplistic effort met with failure, a second algorithm was needed. The second algorithm was developed upon the information known about the limitations of the first algorithm. A suitable method of compensating for the non-linear dependent dynamic variables was needed. To address this dilemma, an artificial neural network approach was taken for the second algorithm. The second algorithm’s construction was to utilise an artificial neural network to capture the kinematic linkage characteristics and all other dynamic dependent variable behaviour and estimate the payload information based upon the linkage position and hydraulic cylinder pressures. This algorithm was trained using emperically collected data and then subjected to actual use in the field. This experiment showed that that the dynamic complexity of the estimation problem was too large for a small (and computationally feasible) artificial neural network to characterize such that the error estimate was less than the 1 % full scale requirement. A third algorithm was required due to the failures of the first two. The third algorithm was constructed to ii take advantage of the kinematic model developed and utilise the artificial neural network’s ability to perform nonlinear mapping. As such, the third algorithm developed uses the kinematic model output as an input to the artificial neural network. This change from the second algorithm keeps the network from having to characterize the linkage kinematics and only forces the network to compensate for the dependent dynamic variables excluded by the kinematic linkage model. This algorithm showed significant improvement over the previous two but still did not meet the required 1 % full scale requirement. The promise shown by this algorithm however was convincing enough that further effort was spent in trying to refine it to improve the accuracy. The fourth algorithm developed proceeded with improving the third algorithm. This was accomplished by adding additional inputs to the artificial neural network that allowed the network to better compensate for the variables present in the problem. This effort produced an algorithm that, when subjected to actual field use, produced results very near the 1 % full scale accuracy requirement. This algorithm could be improved upon slightly with better input data filtering and possibly adding additional network inputs. The final algorithm produced results very near the desired accuracy. This algorithm was also novel in that for this estimation, the artificial neural network was not used soley as the means to characterize the problem for estimation purposes. Instead, much of the responsibility for the mathematical characterization of the problem was placed upon a kinematic linkage model that then fed it’s own payload estimate into the neural network where the estimate was further refined during network training with calibration data and additional inputs. This method of nonlinear state estimation (i. e. utilising a neural network to compensate for nonlinear effects in conjunction with a first principles model) has not been seen previously in the literature...|$|R

An evaluation system was to be developed for the long-term data, and this was to be programmed {{in the form of a}} database. Furthermore, correlations between axle load distributions and the vehicle mix, depending on the traffic characteristics of a section, were to be investigated. During the test operation the accuracy of the dynamic axle load equipment was to be checked with the aid of static weighing equipment (wheel load measuring equipment), and the experience gained during the practical operation of the equipment systems was to be documented. The documentation of all breakdowns and malfunctions showed limited breakdown times of a total of one to three weeks for each of the five measuring points during a stipulated eight-month analysis period. In the initial phase there were a few breakdowns and malfunctions in the equipment due to hardware and software errors, which were immediately remedied through exchanging the respective defect electronic components and improving the software - in particular to adapt it to the TLS requirements. With regard to the accuracy of the axle load measurements compared to the static measuring results, relatively limited deviations were determined, and the long-term stability of the calibration setting was proved over a period of six months. After initial difficulties, the equipment system with bending plates which was used for these measurements was hence able to prove its suitability, above all with regard to the further expansion of the network.

Using a mixedmethods approach, this project aimed to uncover gastric bypass patients‟ experiences with long-term dietary practices and weight loss. All {{participants in this}} project were recruited from support groups in Upstate New York and were a mini mum of one year post-surgery. In-depth, semi-structured, qualitative interviews were used to gain descriptions of patients‟ experiences with dietary and weight management. Transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method, a grounded theory a pproach, and a constructivist perspective. The first analysis revealed participants‟ weight loss outcome trajectories, which were characterized by periods of weight change accompanied by dietary transitions and changes in dietary management. Participants‟ abilities to make cognitive and behavioral changes in dietary management following surgery differentiated their weight outcomes into one of three long -term trajectories: Maintained, Regain/Lost, or Regained. The second analysis uncovered complex, multi-leveled networks of goals, strategies, and monitoring behaviors. The four emergent main goals (Weight Management, Health, Avoid Negative Reactions, and Integration) were supported by lower level goals. Lower level goals were accomplished through a multitude of strategies. Monitoring methods {{were used to assess}} strategy effectiveness and goal achievement. An emergent hypothesis from this analysis was that monitoring behaviors were related to successful weight loss outcomes after gastric bypass surgery. To explo re this relationship, an on-line survey was developed to assess dietary monitoring (keeping food records and portion control methods), weight monitoring (self-weighing with a scale), and their association with current BMI, percent excess BMI lost, and percent weight loss maintained. Higher scores for dietary monitoring behaviors, being unmarried, and lower pre-surgery BMI were associated with lower current BMI and greater excess BMI lost, when controlling for age, sex, and time since surgery.

Then, a series of signal processing techniques based on such an analysis are implemented, in order to attenuate the magnitude of the undesired flow-induced forces as well as the embedded measurement noise from the system´s output signal, so that the measurand can be determined as a time-varying state variable. The effectiveness of this new flowmeter calibration method is validated by a series of numerical and experimental tests, in which according to their results, it reveals that an accuracy level smaller than 0, 1 % is attainable by applying the proposed method. Furthermore, this document offers a guideline of how to improve in future the performance of the proposed measurement principle...|$|E
40|$|Static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>weighing</b> {{systems are}} now the most {{prominent}} measurement and control instruments of raw materials flow rate. Considering the development of technology in industries, fabrication of special progressive systems of weighing in which the used state of art modern control methods of mechatronics has changed the process of classical control principles based on fieldbus technology {{development and use of}} the various types of data exchange protocols have {{led to the creation of}} flexible ways of interconnections between DCS system and main controllers with related modular boards. In industrial sectors, the raw material that is entering to the system must be in an equal ratio for the production and it should be weighed properly for further use. In this project the main focus is on the raw material handling system that is to know the amount of raw material entering to the system by using load cell and controllers. Weigh feeders are used to weigh and to handle the raw material. It weighs accurately the raw material for maintain proper blend for sinter. This blend is called as basemix material. Programmable Logical Controller controls the weigh feeders by using speed sensors, load cell, VFD and by using the control input. By designing the certain parameters whole system is controlled by using Programmable Logic Controllers. In this paper PLC is used to control overall system because it is capable o...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a hybrid dryer based on heat pump and radio frequency drying technologies for the batch drying of brick materials. In {{the first part}} of the thesis the experimental aspects are detailed. The test apparatus has been commissioned by retro-fitting a radio frequency (rf) generator to the drying chamber of an existing heat pump dryer. A <b>dynamic</b> <b>weighing</b> system has been built and forms the central part of an extensive drying process data acquisition system. A number of practical difficulties due to thermal effects associated with drying and high frequency electromagnetic interference have been addressed. Drying results of the combination system are presented, including those obtained by a novel application of pulsed rf energy in association with heat pump technology for the drying of wet particulates and green house bricks. Limitations of the original experimental apparatus are highlighted and solutions given. A test cell, specially designed and built for carrying out dielectric property measurements of the processed materials, has produced good repeatable results. In the second part of the thesis a theoretical scheme is presented based upon the balance equations of the 'volume averaged' drying load for a modelling of the combined drying process. Particular attention has been paid to the electric field, generated within the material during drying, which depends on the rf electrode voltage and the changing dielectric properties of the drying load. A validation test of the model shows good agreement with the experimental results and demonstrates the ability of such, albeit simplistic, model to investigate different combination drying cases.
