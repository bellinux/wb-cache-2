25|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} that 7α-TMS accounts for around 80% of the potassium-sparing effect of spironolactone while canrenone only accounts for the remaining approximate 10 to 25%. In accordance, 7α-TMS occurs at higher circulating concentrations than does canrenone and has a higher relative affinity for the MR. Other known but more minor metabolites of spironolactone include 7α-thiospironolactone (7α-TS), {{as well as the}} 7α-methyl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> of spironolactone and the 6β-hydroxy-7α-methyl <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> of spironolactone. In addition to the MR, 7α-TS and 7α-TMS have been found to possess approximately equivalent affinity for the rat prostate AR relative to that of spironolactone, thus likely accounting for the retention of the antiandrogenic activity of spironolactone.|$|E

40|$|The methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> of {{vegetable}} oils, known as biodiesel {{are becoming increasingly}} popular because of their low environmental impact and potential as a green alternative fuel for diesel engine. In the present work, methyl and <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> of nerium oil were prepared by transesterification using both methanol and ethanol. However, viscosity of <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> of nerium oil (EEON) was slightly {{higher than that of}} methyl esters of nerium oil (MEON). A single cylinder stationary kirloskar engine is used to compare the Performance and Emission and Combustion characteristics between pure diesel and nerium blends. The nerium oil blends are in percentage of 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %, and 100 % of nerium oil to 80 %, 60 %, 40 %, 20 % and 0 % of diesel. Results show that methyl esters of nerium oil (MEON) produced slightly higher efficiency than <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> of nerium oil (EEON). Exhaust emissions and Combustion characteristics of methyl esters of nerium oil (MEON) were also higher than <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> of nerium oil (EEON).

25|$|Chemically, transesterified {{biodiesel}} comprises {{a mix of}} mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids. The {{most common}} form uses methanol (converted to sodium methoxide) to produce methyl esters (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME) {{as it is the}} cheapest alcohol available, though ethanol can be used to produce an <b>ethyl</b> <b>ester</b> (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid <b>Ethyl</b> <b>Ester</b> – FAEE) biodiesel and higher alcohols such as isopropanol and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the cold flow properties of the resulting ester, at the cost of a less efficient transesterification reaction. A lipid transesterification production process is used to convert the base oil to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids (FFAs) in the base oil are either converted to soap and removed from the process, or they are esterified (yielding more biodiesel) using an acidic catalyst. After this processing, unlike straight vegetable oil, biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and can replace it in most current uses.|$|E

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{eco-friendly}} biomass derived fuels in transportation requires a fundamental understanding of the uniqueness of their oxidation and combustion characteristics. This paper focuses on one specific class of biofuels, namely Fatty Acids <b>Ethyl</b> <b>Esters</b> (FAEE). A counterflow configuration was employed to measure the extinction limits of the diffusion flames of four <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> (ethyl- butanoate, pentanoate, heptanoate, and nonanoate). The results were {{compared to that of}} methyl esters (Diévart et al., 2012, Proceedings of the Combustion Institute, 34). It was observed that both methyl <b>esters</b> and <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> exhibit similar high temperature reactivity against extinction. The use of the transport-weighted enthalpy metric has revealed that all esters share similar chemical kinetics in the near extinction conditions of the present study. A previous detailed kinetic model has been extended to include the oxidation chemistry of <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters,</b> and used to interpret the experimental observations. Good agreement between the computed and experimental extinction limits was observed. The rates of consumption pathway analysis have shown that <b>ethyl</b> <b>esters</b> exclusively decomposed into ethylene and a carboxylic acid through an endothermic six-centered unimolecular decomposition reaction, while methyl esters oxidation preferentially progresses through H abstraction reactions. However, the growth of the radical pool was observed to be driven indifferently between <b>ethyl</b> and methyl <b>esters,</b> therefore resulting in similar global flame reactivity...|$|R
