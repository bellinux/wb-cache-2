40|$|Combustion {{synthesis}} (CS) generally involves mixing reactants together (e. g., metal powders) and igniting the mixture. Typically, {{a reaction}} wave will {{pass through the}} sample. In <b>field</b> <b>activated</b> combustion synthesis (FACS), the addition of an electric field has a marked effect on the dynamics of wave propagation and on the nature, composition, and homogeneity of the product as well as capillary flow, mass-transport in porous media, and Marangoni flows, which are influenced by gravity. The objective is to understand {{the role of an}} electric field in CS reactions under conditions where gravity-related effects are suppressed or altered. The systems being studied are Ti+Al and Ti+ 3 Al. Two different ignition orientations have been used to observe effects of gravity when one of the reactants becomes molten. This consequentially influences the position and concentration of the electric current, which in turn influences the entire process. Experiments have also been performed in microgravity conditions. This process has been named Microgravity <b>Field</b> <b>Activated</b> Combustion Synthesis (MFACS). Effects of gravity have been demonstrated, where the reaction wave temperature and velocity demonstrate considerable differences besides the changes of combustion mechanisms with the different high currents applied. Also the threshold for the formation of a stable reaction wave is increased under zero gravity conditions. Electric current was also utilized with a chemical oven technique, where inserts of aluminum with minute amounts of tungsten and tantalum were used to allow observation of effects of settling of the higher density solid particles in liquid aluminum at the present temperature profile and wave velocity of the reaction...|$|E

40|$|International audienceCobalt ferrite {{exhibits}} a high coercivity {{at room temperature}} and a strong magnetic anisotropy {{compared to the other}} spinel ferrites and, consequently appears as an interesting material for permanent magnets and high-density recording. The magnetic properties depend also on the crystallite size. In order to keep the powder properties in a bulk material, dense nanostructured cobalt ferrite has to be sintered. A <b>field</b> <b>activated</b> sintering process like spark plasma sintering (SPS) may be promising for such challenge. The present paper deals with: (i) the preparation of cobalt ferrite by two methods: coprecipitation and hydrothermal synthesis in supercritical water; (ii) the SPS sintering of the cobalt ferrite nanopowder prepared by coprecipitation. The sintering of the as-processed powder and that obtained after a thermal treatment resulting in the spinel phase has been investigated.

Surface-cleaning of particles, especially during the initial stage of sintering, is a crucial issue for the densification mechanism. However, up to date, the mechanism of surface-cleaning is too complicated to be known. In this paper, the process of surface-cleaning of Micro-FAST was studied, employing the high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) for observation of microstructure of micro-particles. According {{to the evolution of}} the microstructure, surface-cleaning is mainly ascribed to the effect of electro-thermal focusing.

40|$|Nanocrystalline bulk {{materials}} are desirable for many applications as they combine mechanical strength and specific electronic transport properties. Our bottom up approach starts with tailored nanoparticles. Compaction and thermal treatment are crucial, but usually {{the final stage}} sintering is accompanied by rapid grain growth which spoils nanocristallinity. For electrically conducting nanoparticles, <b>field</b> <b>activated</b> sintering techniques overcome this problem. Small grain sizes have been maintained in spite of consolidation. Nevertheless, the underlying principles, which are of high practical impact, have not been fully elucidated yet. In this combined experimental and theoretical work we show, how the developing microstructure during sintering correlates to the percolation paths of the current through the powder using highly doped silicon nanoparticles as a model system. It is possible to achieve a nanocrystalline bulk material and a homogeneous microstructure. For this, not only the generation of current paths due compaction, but also the disintegration due to joule heating is required.
