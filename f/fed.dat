In the semifinals against Germany she played two rubbers, one was won against Julia Görges, another against Andrea Petkovic. With her win over Görges, Kuznetsova became the second-best Russian <b>Fed</b> Cup player by total wins, with 27 won rubbers; the {{absolute}} leader is Larisa Savchenko, with 40 won rubbers.

5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber.

5|$|In this {{double-blind}} RCT, the preterm infants were <b>fed</b> either control formula containing phospholipids {{derived from}} egg yolk lecithin with sphingomyelin at 13% of total phospholipid or a supplemented formula with milk-derived phospholipids containing 20% sphingomyelin.

The infants <b>fed</b> the supplemented formula also showed improvements across multiple developmental measures at 18 months, with significantly better scores on the Behavior Rating Scale of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II), the Fagan test (novelty preference rate), the latency of visual evoked potentials (VEP), and sustained attention test than in the control group.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is twofold. First, we {{characterize}} the <b>Fed’s</b> systematic response to technology shocks and its implications for U. S. output, hours and inflation. Second, we evaluate the extent to which those responses can be accounted for by a simple monetary policy rule (including the optimal one) {{in the context of a}} standard business cycle model with sticky prices. Our main results can be described as follows: First, we detect significant differences across periods in the response of the economy (as well as the <b>Fed’s)</b> to a technology shock. Second, the <b>Fed’s</b> response to a technology shock in the Volcker– Greenspan period is consistent with an optimal monetary policy rule. Third, in the Pre-Volcker period the <b>Fed’s</b> policy tended to overstabilize output at the cost of generating excessive inflation volatility. Our evidence reinforces recent results in the literature suggesting an improvement in the <b>Fed’s</b> performance...|$|R

They were formed in 1991 and originated from the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education (now known as Liverpool Hope University) were they entered the North West Women's Regional Football League. The name <b>Feds</b> originates from the Liverpool Institute of Higher Education College origins where the sports teams played as a Federation of the St Katherine’s and Christ Notre Dame Colleges. In 1993, Liverpool <b>Feds</b> Reserves L.F.C. were formed, and currently play in the North West Women's Regional Football League. Additionally, the girls youth sections were created, and play their football in the Liverpool County FA Girls Leagues. Subsequently, the Development Squad and Under 18's soon followed. Liverpool <b>Feds</b> L.F.C. play their home games at the I M Marsh Campus (LJMU) in Liverpool. Most recently, the season 2008-2009 saw the ladies win the North West Women's Regional Football League and gain promotion to the FA Women's Premier League Northern Division 1.

40|$|An {{efficient}} three-dimensional (3 -D) computer-aided-design (CAD) {{tool for}} modeling and simulating field-emission devices/displays (<b>FEDs)</b> is presented. The performance optimization of <b>FEDs</b> using this CAD tool {{and the design}} of experiment (DOE) method is demonstrated. Experimental results of emission current and spot size are in good agreement with the simulated results. The regression models created by the DOE method give excellent guidelines for both the design and operation of the <b>FEDs.</b> This CAD tool uses an accelerated boundary-element-method (BEM) electrostatics solver and an adaptive explicit integration method. The typical CPU time for a complete electrostatics and trajectory simulation is less than 1 hour running on a SUN Ultra 30 model 295 workstation, versus a few hours/days for 3 -D finite-element-methods (FEM) simulations. The simulated results of a single-gate field emitter array (FEA) are in excellent agreement with experimental results. Simulation examples of proximity focused <b>FEDs</b> and integrated-focus-electrode (IFE) focused <b>FEDs</b> are also presented. A design strategy using DOE techniques is proposed.

5|$|The {{experimental}} potatoes {{had been}} transformed with the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) gene from the Galanthus (snowdrop) plant, allowing the GNA lectin protein to be synthesised. This lectin is toxic to some insects. Rats were <b>fed</b> raw and cooked genetically modified potatoes, using unmodified Desiree Red potatoes as controls. One control group ate an unmodified Desiree Red potato spiked with the GNA snowdrop lectin. Twelve feeding experiments were conducted, ten short-term (10 days) and two long-term (110 days). Before the experiment Pusztai and his team said they expected no differences between the rats <b>fed</b> modified potatoes and rats <b>fed</b> the non-modified ones.|$|E
5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats <b>fed</b> raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats <b>fed</b> the unmodified potato. The crypt length in the jejunum was greater on rats <b>fed</b> the raw modified potato, although there was no statistical difference observed in the rats <b>fed</b> the cooked potato. As these effects were not observed in rats <b>fed</b> the control potatoes spiked with GNA, Pusztai concluded that the differences were a result of the transformation procedure, rather than the presence of GNA. Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 21 - 24). Based on {{claims made}} in the existing literature, and guided by the Behavioral Ecological Model, this study quantitatively assessed excessive weight management behaviors and potentially related variables among Female Exotic Dancers (<b>FEDs)</b> in San Diego County. This study aimed to assess the relationship of objectification, harassment, and club type to excessive weight management behaviors. The current study used data from a cross-sectional pilot study that used a 400 -item survey to interview a total of 123 <b>FEDs.</b> The {{results of this study}} indicate that 52. 9 % (n = 65) of <b>FEDs</b> report in engaging in at least one excessive weight management behavior. Results from bivariate analyses found no reliable relationship between excessive weight management behaviors and verbal harassment, touching, or club type. However, results from this study support existing literature that suggest <b>FEDs</b> utilize excessive weight management behaviors to control their weight or figure for dancing. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} quantitative studies are needed to explore the contextual variables that uniquely influence excessive weight management behavior among <b>FEDs...</b>|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} tests of the expectations hypothesis is Mankiw and Miron (1986), who found that the spread between the long-term and short-term rates provided predictive power for the short-term rate before the <b>Fed's</b> founding but not after. They suggested that the failure of the expectations hypothesis after the <b>Fed's</b> founding was due to the <b>Fed's</b> practice of smoothing short-term interest rates. We show that their finding that the expectations hypothesis fares better prior to the <b>Fed's</b> founding {{is due to the fact}} that the test they employ tends to generate results that are more favorable to the expectations hypothesis during periods when there is extreme volatility in the short-term rate.

5|$|Even {{though the}} {{boundary}} event was severe, there was significant {{variability in the}} rate of extinction between and within different clades. Species that depended on photosynthesis declined or became extinct as atmospheric particles blocked sunlight and reduced the solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth. This plant extinction caused a major reshuffling of the dominant plant groups. Omnivores, insectivores, and carrion-eaters survived the extinction event, perhaps because of the increased availability of their food sources. No purely herbivorous or carnivorous mammals seem to have survived. Rather, the surviving mammals and birds <b>fed</b> on insects, worms, and snails, which in turn <b>fed</b> on dead plant and animal matter. Scientists hypothesize that these organisms survived the collapse of plant-based food chains because they <b>fed</b> on detritus (non-living organic material).|$|E
