50|$|Dangerous Goods Inspector: Dangerous <b>Goods</b> <b>Inspectors</b> (DGIs) are {{specialized}} independent {{enforcement officers}} that primarily {{spend most of}} their time in a vehicle on patrol. DGIs are responsible for providing education to drivers and carriers, seeking compliance with and enforcing the Transportation of Dangerous Good Regulations of Canada and are empowered by the Transport of Dangerous Goods Act of British Columbia. DGIs regularly liaise with Transport Canada and may assist Transport Canada with investigations into non-compliant carriers or facilities. DGIs have a thorough understanding of the federal regulations and all of its parts relating to road transport including Parts 1 to 9, Schedules 1 to 3 and Equivalent Level of Safety certificates. Much like the CTEO and AVI, the DGI can issue warnings, appearance notices, violation tickets, out-of-service declarations, order mechanical inspections, driver license suspensions, vehicle impounds, and may delay or detain vehicles and/or drivers. DGIs often have years of prior experience in a previous role such a CTI or CTEO and are trained and certified in Transportation of Dangerous Goods prior to becoming a DGI.|$|E

At any rate the prisoner went free, {{and returned to his}} home, whilst Vincent wore a convict's chain, did a convict's work, lived on convict's fare, and, what was worse, had only convict society. He was soon sought out and released, but the hurts he had received from the pressure of the chain lasted all his life. He never spoke of the event; it was kept a strict secret; and once when he had referred to it in a letter to a friend, he became so much afraid that the story would become known that he sent to ask for the letter back again. It was, however, not returned, and it makes the fact certain. It would be a dangerous precedent if prison chaplains were to change places with their charges; and, beautiful as was Vincent's spirit, the act can hardly be justified; but it should also be remembered that among the galleys of France there were then many who had been condemned for resistance to the arbitrary will of Cardinal de Richelieu, men not necessarily corrupt and degraded like the thieves and murderers with whom they were associated. At any rate, M. de Joigni did not displace the almoner, and Vincent worked on the consciences of the convicts with infinitely more force for having been for a time one of themselves. Many and many were won back to penitence, a hospital was founded for them, better regulations established, and, for a time, both prisons and galleys were wonderfully improved, although only for the life-time of the <b>good</b> <b>inspector</b> and the saintly almoner.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of transportation is breaking down biogeographical boundaries with profound con-sequences (OTA, 1993; Vitousek et al., 1997; Mooney and Hobbs, 2000; Loope et al., 2001). An ever-growing volume of transported goods, increasing efficiency and speed, advancing technologies (such as containerization), and trade agreements are {{key components of}} the phenomenon (Bright, 1999). For example, the number of sea containers coming into U. S. ports has recently been doubling each decade, from 8 million in 1980, to 16 million in 1990, to 33 million in 2000. Each of these railroad-car sized containers weighs about 13 tons when loaded, {{and no one is}} keeping watch on what is in them (Baker and Sullivan, 2001). A recent Australian study showed that even empty sea cargo containers, temporarily out of use, contain some live as well as many dead pests (Stanaway et al., 2001). Much less material is transported as air cargo, using smaller containers, but still the quantity is huge. Agricultural material is usually shipped as air cargo – keeping produce fresh and pests in <b>good</b> condition. Agricultural <b>inspectors</b> valiantly examine at least a small sample of what comes in. In the United States, the agency responsible for protecting our nation’s borders from biological pollution is APHIS, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Because of growing recognition of the need to better address biological invasions, APHIS is starting to focus beyond its primary mandate of protecting mainstream American agriculture. The challenges are huge. Just one example, the attempts to stop spread of the highly invasive and destructive brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis [Merrem]) in military cargo from Guam have not prevented interceptions as far away as Texas and Spain, and eight of these snakes have been found alive or dead at Honolulu airports (Rodda et al., 1997, 1999) ...|$|R

Captain Sawyer maintained that the two vessels exchanged one blast signals indicating the conventional port-to-port passing signal. Captain Nelson asserted that the vessels exchanged two blast signals for a starboard-to-starboard passing. At the time impact, the Superior City was swinging across the King’s bow while Captain Nelson swung his bow hard aport and rang the telegraph to stop and then full astern. The estimated speed at the time of impact was 12 mi per hour for the King, and 10.5 mi per hour for the Superior City.The accident was investigated by U.S. Steamboat <b>Inspectors</b> <b>Gooding</b> and Hanson of Marquette, Michigan.

40|$|While women {{constitute}} {{more than}} 51 % {{of the population}} and far outnumber men in teaching positions in Namibia, very few occupy positions of leadership. Male candidates are still favoured for top positions, thereby denying women the chance to gain entrance to these positions. One of the reasons for this imbalance seems to be that, in spite of conscious political effort and legislation, women may still be perceived as less effective leaders than men. This research focused on leadership in education, in particular school principals, and explored the perceptions of female principalship held by school inspectors. Three school inspectors from the Rundu Education Region were purposefully selected and interviewed. Inspectors were selected on the grounds of their considerable influence in the selection and appointment of school principals. The study found that these inspectors favour school principals who show commitment to their work, have good interpersonal working relationships, are caring, good listeners, visionary and produce <b>good</b> results. The <b>inspectors</b> attribute female principals’ success to their traditionally perceived characteristics, such as caring leadership and ability to develop good human relations. Instead of perceiving these qualities as professionally negative (as is sometimes argued in the literature) the inspectors see them as indisputable assets to leadership. The respondents acknowledge the cultural stereotyping that may have influenced male attitudes to women in the past, but argue that good leadership is not specific to gender, but part of the qualities a person possesses, regardless of sex. This study concludes that, contrary to what has been reported in many studies, these inspectors perceive women principals as effective – equal to their male counterparts or sometimes even more effective - because they are caring, well organized and good at communicating and establishing relations with others. Though these qualities are different from the traditional masculine qualities which include independence and emotional strength, the respondents recognize and legitimize them as preferred qualities in current effective leadership practice...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Turkey, {{teachers}} in several subject areas were trained through regular {{teacher education programs}} for years. Since the regular teacher education programs have been insufficient {{to meet the demands}} in the country, alternative routes to teacher certification have been searched to struggle against teacher shortages in many subjects. This paper introduces alternative route certified teachers (ACTs) serving at the elementary schools in Turkey. This study aims to clarify ACTs’ problems, perceptions and up to date opinions about teaching, and compare their expectations during the induction period. These aims were examined into two steps. The first study was conducted during the ACTs’ induction period in 2001, and the second one was performed in 2008. The data were collected through two question forms for the first step, and the second step of the study. Both of the instruments were generated by the researcher {{on the basis of the}} literature. The participants in the first step comprised 829, and in the second step contained 85 ACTs. The paper provides empirical insights about ACTs’ perceptions about teaching. ACTs had difficulty in planning, finding instructional materials, lecturing, developing instructional materials, carrying out group activities, dealing with students, and establishing <b>good</b> relations with <b>inspectors</b> and parents during their induction period. While more than half of the ACTs stated that they chose teaching since they felt teaching was appropriate for them in the first study, most of them indicated that they chose teaching because of unemployment in the second study. ACTs graduated from the departments of management, economics, and communication were more satisfied with teaching than the others. In addition, female ACTs were seen more satisfied with teaching than the male. Besides, Most of the ACTs’ expectations for future were not related to their career. Finally, almost all participants believe that, ACTs should not be allowed to work at schools without teaching certificate, and anyone who does not like children should not be allowed to be teacher. The lack of information about the numbers of the ACTs, who work at schools and who quitted to profession, is the main limitation of the study. Furthermore, insufficient number of the ACTs, who willing to participate in the second study, is the second limitation of the second study. The paper presents findings to the interested public about ACTs’ perceptions of teaching. ACTs’ ideas and feelings on teaching profession in their initial years (1996 – 1999), and today are important aspects of the study. Besides, the paper enlightens the administrators and policy makers, for the development of a powerful strategy to combat teacher shortage. The study highlights how it is crucial to pursue teacher education planning to improve quality in education...|$|R
