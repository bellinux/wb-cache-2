5000|$|The drawing, 359 mm X 502 mm on paper, {{executed}} in red-chalk on an underlying metal point sketch has the collector's stamp {{in the upper}} right corner. This collectors stamp confirms with certainty that this drawing was once part of the collection, which Count Bernardino Ubaldini, in 1667, donated to the library of Urbania, Marche Italy. The collection consisted {{of a large number}} of drawings and prints of various quality. The custodians of the library at the time, the religious order of the 'Padri Caraciolini', had pasted the drawings in two different books. The first book in which drawings pasted in was Baldus de Ubaldi's 'Consilia' from 1490. The second volume of the donation included drawings pasted in Alexander Imolensis' 'Consilia', Lione edition from 1549. These two volumes are preserved, although the collection has been dismantled from them [...] The drawing is also remarkable in that it is ‘signed’ [...] "Raphaello fecit" [...] under which an additional illegible word has also been placed. The signature [...] "Raphaello" [...] has been crossed over and a reattribution has been added: [...] "Veneziano". The drawing has a short text on the verso side (of which not all is legible): Nr 32 (collection number of 'Collezione Ubaldini' questo disegno Appartiene a Lambertini prospero….dalla esegui che dicesi esser quello che Raffaello Regalo al Mag. Francia cio é per traduzione(?) di quello che lo stesso esegui)In 1678, when Malvasia publishes his history of painting in Bologna: 'Felsina Pittrice', he includes a transcript of a letter, which he claimed to have seen, sent from Raphael in Rome in 1508 to his friend Francesco Francia in Bologna. In this letter Raphael writes: “In Mean while I send to you by this same messenger, who will be going back in six days, another drawing, viz an ‘Adoration of the Shepherds’ (presepe), which, as you will see, differs very much from the picture I painted, and of which you were kind enough to speak in such favourable terms”. The paining referred to is regarded as lost, while in Bologna, at the request of Bentivoglio. Francesco Filippini, goes into detail in explaining and discussing the dates of Raphael’s visit to Bologna in 1506-1507. The painting is believed lost in a fire of the Bentivoglio estate, when the papal troops invaded Bologna [...] The current drawing was not part of 'Collezione Ubaldini' during great inventory of 1837, and it is currently not known when and why it departed from this important collection. Malvasia, as we deduce from his publication, did not see the Raphael’s drawing, but only the letter referencing it. As Malvasia’s book had been published in 1678, it could be argued that this text, referring to Raphael and the relationship with Francia, is actually a reference to Malvasia's 'Felsina Pittrice'. However the signature of “Raphaello” and the drawing predates 'Felsina Pittrice' by Malvasia, which is a concern if the drawing is based on the facts related in the letter, as the collection was donate already in 1667, 11 year prior to the printing of 'Felsina Pittrice'. Ames Lewis, writes in the case of the final “modello” for the 'Massacre of the Innocents' “The final “modello”, on which these experiments in red chalk were brought together in preparation for the engravers work, is a precise and <b>highly</b> <b>worked</b> and therefore rather impersonal drawing. Marcantonio Raimondo followed almost line for line the pen and ink hatchings, which spread much more consistently over the figures than in earlier compositional drafts. ” Ames - Lewis refers to the final drawing technique of Raphael as “tight and incisive”. Ames Lewis concludes that Raphael’s style in 1508, which serves him the rest of his career in which forms are generated by generic repeated contours, and in which internal modelling is briefly indicated by quick flecks of hatching and deeper shadows by bolder parallel hatched lines.|$|E
40|$|Failure of Stirling Space Power Demonstrator Engine (SPDE) {{regenerator}} screens was investigated. After {{several hours}} of operation the SPDE was shut down for inspection and on removing the regenator screens, debris of unknown origin was discovered along with considerable cracking of the screens in localized areas. Metallurgical analysis of the debris determined it to be cracked-off-deformed pieces of the 41 micron thickness Type 304 stainless steel wire screen. Scanning electron microscopy of the cracked screens revealed failures occurring at wire crossovers and fatigue striations on the fracture surface of the wires. Thus, the screen failure {{can be characterized as}} a fatigue failure of the wires. The crossovers were determined to contain 30 percent reduction in wire thickness and a <b>highly</b> <b>worked</b> microstructure occurring from the manufacturing process of the wire screens. Later it was found that reduction in wire thickness occurred because the screen fabricator had subjected it to a light cold-roll process after weaving. Installation of this screen left a clearance in the regenerator allowing the screens to move. The combined effects of the reduction in wire thickness, stress concentration (caused by screen movement), and <b>highly</b> <b>worked</b> microstructure at the wire crossovers led to the fatigue failure of the screens...|$|E

40|$|Current of Music is {{the latest}} in the series of Theodor W. Adorno’s {{hitherto}} unpublished lectures and fragments to be published by Suhrkamp and Polity. Two points single out this offering from its predecessors. First, much of it was originally written in English, a language that the author was still mastering (having fled Germany for Oxford in 1934). The book documents Adorno’s contribution to the Princeton Radio Research Project from his time as its Director of Music between 1938 and 1941. Second, Current of Music is, in a too obvious sense, a failed work, given Adorno’s ‘dismissal ’ from the Project without a complete publication (only a couple of articles appeared). Moreover, whereas the other music themed books in the above series may be termed genuine fragments – Beethoven (1998) and Towards a Theory of Musical Reproduction (2006) – Current of Music is comprised of <b>highly</b> <b>worked</b> and at times repetitive documents (seven in total, plus nine ‘Other Materials’). This weariness is exacerbated by the fact that its subject, US radio music of the 1930 s, is for us a distant one. Having said all that, the work’s underlying question concerning the relationship between cultural forms, technology and capitalism remains extremely pertinent, as I shall attempt to demonstrate. Looking beyond the problems of its mode of presentation, Current of Music serves as an important counterpoint to Walter Benjamin’s ‘The Work of Art in the Age of its Technological Reproducibility ’ (1936, in Benjamin 2006). Adorno responded critically to that now famous essay in correspondence with Benjamin...|$|E
40|$|The {{ways of life}} of the {{inhabitants}} of prehistoric New Britain were almost unknown to archaeologists until {{the last quarter of}} the twentieth century. Until recently, the people who lived there during the early to mid-Holocene period, and who left scant traces in the archaeological record, were assumed to have been residentially mobile foragers living in simple societies. More recent research has shown that people were making and exchanging large, <b>highly</b> <b>worked,</b> obsidian tools. The inference was that these tools carried a component of social value and were used to signal status, and that the societies of mid-Holocene New Britain were more complex than previously thought. My aim is to demonstrate that a detailed study of a distinctive class of obsidian stemmed tools supports the proposition that networks, in which concepts of social value existed and symbolic capital was exchanged, flourished in West New Britain in the period 5900 - 3600 BP. This is achieved primarily by using a high-magnification use-wear analysis which, together with supplementary typological and raw material provenancing evidence, enables use-lives of individual artefacts to be constructed. An exploration of both the nature of value and of archaeological evidence for the ways in which people behave in response to the social value of such as status, prestige and identity provides a basis for linking the object biographies of these objects with ways in which people acted in response to symbolic and social value. The results demonstrate that one group of stemmed tools were standardised products made by specialist craft workers acting within some form of social network and exchange system. The people who owned them treated them as ‘special’ objects, recognizing that some of the value attached to these tools was distinct from and separate to any value they may have had as practical utensils. Use-wear is customarily seen as a functional analysis approach which provides data about matters such as diet and subsistence. Employing use-wear to address more abstract concepts such as status, prestige and identity is innovative and marks a step forward in the way in which a high-magnification microwear study can contribute to archaeology...|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to examine the effect of strain and path change on the microstructural evolution of ultrafine grained interstitial free (IF) steel during equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE); to determine the mechanical properties; to observe the resulting texture; and to perform optical and electron microscopy of the resulting material. The effects of different routes of extrusion (A, B, C, C' and E), heat treatment and plastic strains from 1. 15 to 18. 4 were examined. Monotonous tensile testing was used to determine mechanical behavior of processed materials. X-ray diffraction and TEM analyses were performed to evaluate the effect of processing on texture and grain morphology. Hardness measurements were performed to determine recrystallization behavior of the processed material. Optical microscopy was conducted on heat treated samples to determine their grain size and refinement. Monotonous tensile testing of processed materials showed that there was significant strengthening after the first extrusion. Further processing resulted in increasing values of yield strength and ultimate tensile strength, with ductility at failure varying depending upon which processing route was used. The best tensile strength results were obtained after processing Routes 8 C' and 16 E, due to the significant grain refinement these routes produced. X-ray diffraction revealed increases in strength of preferred texture along the directions [111] and [001], perpendicular to the transverse plane, for all specimens that were processed using ECAE. TEM observations showed a consistent refinement of grain size as the amount of processing increased, especially within Routes C' and E. Hardness measurements of heat treated specimens showed that the onset of recrystallization occurred at approximately the same temperature of recrystallization as that of pure iron, 450 ????C. The recrystallization curves for all samples showed that grain growth begins at a temperature of around 700 ????C. The low carbon content of IF steel made optical microscopy challenging. The grain size of annealed materials becomes finer and more uniform, ranging between 60 and 90 ????m 2, at high strain levels under Routes C' and E, due to the many potential nucleation sites developed in <b>highly</b> <b>worked</b> material...|$|E

40|$|Marulić’s epistolary oeuvre {{comprises}} 22 {{texts that}} {{can be defined as}} epistles. This article starts off from the definition of epistle that is provided to Marulić by contemporary epistolary manuals - those of Erasmus, Vives and Niger. An epistle is a prose text that serves for the communication of absent interlocutors, and has to satisfy the following formal requirements: {{at the beginning and end}} there must be a formulaic greeting; it bears information important for the absent addressee, and it is in its scope quite limited. This definition eliminates from Marulić’s epistolary oeuvre several texts that have been so far included among them (poetic epistles, In epigrammata priscorum commentarius). These humanists, in their instructions for writing letters, insisted on the purity of the greeting at the beginning of the letter - the salutation or salutatio and the valediction or valedictio at the end. As models, they cite the ancient private letters of Cicero and Pliny. In the salutation, which has to be short and clear, one must first state the name of the sender and then of the recipient, irrespective of whether the recipient is hierarchically superior to the sender. The sender must unconditionally address the recipient in the second personal singular, and there must not be any apostrophe at the beginning (“The respected so and so!”). The greeting at the end must be short - “Vale” - and the author need not sign his name, because from the salutation at the beginning it is clear who is writing to whom. The tradition against which the Humanists were fighting was that of the medieval office correspondence - the dictamen - which because of the highly hierarchical structure of society, particularly of the Church, worked on and expanded these elements of the letter. In this article, Marulić’s epistolary texts are considered through the prism of Humanist formal requirements. In the salutation of his letters Marulić on the whole put his own name after that of the recipient; and against the requirements of the Humanists, he also mentioned the titles and attributes of the recipient. Writing in Italian Marulić of courses uses the second person plural, but when in an Italian text he includes a Latin sentence, he forgets to shift to the Humanist “thou” and in the Latin too leaves the “you” - the second personal plural. As distinct from in the Latin letters, in which he mainly keeps to the humanist tradition, in the Italian and Croatian letters the tradition is medieval. The Italian letters to Jerolim Ćipiko have a flourishing superscription, apostrophe and signature. Similar in this respect are two Croatian private letters: the <b>highly</b> <b>worked</b> and flattering address, the apostrophe full of compliments; Marulić sometimes addressed the Benedictine nun Katarina Obirtić in the second person plural; there is nothing Humanist about the valediction. In the dedication to Judith, there are on the formal side more elements that derive from the medieval tradition, although in contemporary Croatian epistolary dedi-cations we can also find dedications written completely in accordance with the Humanist instructions (Hanibal Lucić). There are six of Marulić’s formally exemplary letters; they are very likely like this because they are far from the tradition of office writing. These are mainly letters to friends and associates, Humanists. Marulić, like more or less all the Humanists, wavered between the two epistolary traditions, the medieval and the Humanist. His epistolary oeuvre is an indication that the Middle Ages and Humanism, at the end of the 15 th and beginning of the 16 th centuries, lived a peaceful coexistence, and that each of these traditions found room for itself in works of the same author. The practice of medieval correspondence prevailed in the area of official letters, while in private, Humanist correspondence, depending of course on the topic and importance of the letter, the Ciceronian tradition was successfully revived...|$|E
