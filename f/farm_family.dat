Rutherford developed an interest in law from the age of 16. Although his father discouraged this interest, he allowed Rutherford to go to college under the condition that he pay for a laborer to take his place on the family farm. Rutherford took out a loan and helped to pay for his law studies by working as a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and court stenographer.|$|E

2500|$|Influenced by the Englightenment, several {{changes to}} {{marriage}} occurred: {{the move toward}} individualism and the loosening of church influence over families after the Protestant Reformation resulted in the flourishing of the two-parent <b>farm</b> <b>family.</b> Prior to the Industrial Revolution, the two-parent <b>farm</b> <b>family</b> was the dominant family model, in which both parents working {{side by side on}} family farms [...] The two-parent <b>farm</b> <b>family</b> ceased to be the dominant family model after the Industrial Revolution occurred.

The current literature pertaining to these Quality of Life factors were reviewed to examine if any variation existed among <b>farm</b> <b>families</b> experiencing disability relative to the general farm population. Almost 10 % of Irish <b>farm</b> <b>families</b> experience disability. The principal cause of disability among <b>farm</b> <b>families</b> is often health-related. While <b>farm</b> <b>families</b> feel that <b>farming</b> is a good way of life, the experience of disability can add considerable strain on family life and relationships. <b>Farm</b> <b>families</b> experiencing disability recorded lower <b>family</b> <b>farm</b> incomes and lower participation in off-farm employment. Service and support provision was a concern for <b>farm</b> <b>families</b> experiencing disability. It is imperative the restrictive nature of disability is minimised for <b>farm</b> <b>families.</b> Improved service/support provisions for <b>farm</b> <b>families</b> reporting disability are required for this to be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Exploring the {{determinants}} of good mental health in rural communities is becoming a prominent issue, specifically when examining <b>farming</b> <b>families.</b> <b>Farming</b> stressors are constantly evolving with changes in weather patterns and government legislation adding to the many challenges that <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> face. Researching the mental health issues surrounding <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> can be valuable to all Australians as farming is a primary industry and impeding {{the decline in the}} number of <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> would ultimately benefit the economy. Limited research has been conducted into the decline of <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> as well as the negative effects that working as a primary producer might have on the farming families' mental health. Particularly, this issue needs to be explored as farming related suicide rates are more than twice that of Australian males in general. This research aims to investigate the unique organisational structure of the <b>farming</b> <b>family</b> as a factor affecting the mental health of <b>farming</b> <b>families.</b> Previous research conducted by the principal investigator in 2007 provided support for farmers presenting a unique work-home interface, for though they operate in a business structure that is similar to home-based workers, farmers' present conflict styles that are more similar to work-based workers. There has been limited research conducted into the effects that home and work inter-role conflict would have upon <b>farming</b> <b>families,</b> as well as the coping strategies employed, and stressors of most concern that are relevant to farmers of Australia. Therefore, the primary aim of this project is to adapt, develop and validate measures that assess the work-home interface, coping strategies, and stressors of <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> of Australia. Furthermore, personality characteristics, values, and lifestyle will be investigated. Through these variables it is hoped that effective coping strategies can be outlined to assist those who are in the industry to remain in the industry; to outline the benefits of the lifestyle to encourage new entrants to the industry; and to indentify possible predictive factors of poor mental health in <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> of Australia. Qualitative data derived from semi-structured interviews with <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> across Queensland and South/South-Eastern Australia between October 2008 and January 2009 will be reported. The interviews encouraged participant families to discuss their work and homes roles, stressors, coping strategies, values, and lifestyle. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{farming and}} grazing {{industry}} {{is an industry}} {{where there is a}} constant evolution of stressors, impacting on the <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> ability to remain resilient to these challenges, which is evident through the steady {{decline in the number of}} <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> in the past twenty years. Yet despite the growing number of adversities within the industry (i. e. climate change), some <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> still continue to persevere on the farm. However, due to limited research, little is known about the influence that the farming working lifestyle has upon farming families' well-being. It is important to identify factors that affect <b>farming</b> <b>family</b> well-being as this industry is a vital industry for the Australian economy and needs to be supported. Therefore, the determinants of <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> well-being and the identification of factors which buffer stress and assist in the perseverance of <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> was investigated. Interviews across Queensland and New South Wales were conducted with 53 members of <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> (M= 28, F= 25). As an outcome, themes were identified in relation to what skills and values <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> perceived farmers needed in order to be a successful farmer (Men = managing for the future, respect for land; Women = adaptability). Furthermore, informants reported how they identified with farming (Men & Women = it's who I am) and why they continued to farm (Men = lifestyle, pride in product; Women = lifestyle). As a result, it was proposed that those who had higher levels of commitment to farming and identified more closely with farming were more likely to be satisfied with their life and work and would be able to buffer stress more effectively...|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} 25 years {{the number of}} <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> in Australia has been in steady decline.

40|$|This is a post-print of a {{paper from}} AGRI-FOOD XIV 2007 {{published}} by University of Queensland. [URL] families create opportunities for themselves to take action {{in a wide range}} of areas such as, recreation, socialisation, education, farm-enterprises, businesses, off-farm investments and hobbies. Some of these actions are strategic and lead to major changes in the family’s future. Over the last few years we have developed a ‘decision-systems theory’ (DST) about strategic decisions taken by <b>farming</b> <b>families.</b> The theory was developed from in-depth interviews with <b>farming</b> <b>families.</b> The theory provides an understanding of why <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> create these opportunities. This understanding is important for businesses and governments wanting to influence farmers’ actions. However, and perhaps rather surprisingly, it is also useful for <b>farming</b> <b>families</b> to know about the ‘decision-systems theory’ because it provides a framework to help them make better strategic decisions and also assists family members participate in these decisions. The decision-systems theory has six parts; five relate to the <b>farming</b> <b>family</b> and the sixth concerns how third parties (such as businesses and governments) can interpret the theory for policy development. The paper outlines the six parts of the theory and discusses its use as a tool to build strategic-decision capacity in <b>farming</b> <b>families.</b> The paper ends with an outline of proposed work program to refine and apply the theory in the coming two years. 25 – 29 November 2007 Open Acces...|$|R
