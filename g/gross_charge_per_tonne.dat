40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the Italian {{collective}} {{system for the}} management of household Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE), and its evolution over time, following the European Directives on WEEE, which include the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). The analysis focuses on the technical and economic performance of WEEE compliance organisations (consortia), as they are the key players in the Italian EPR regime. Economic results have not usually been provided in previous studies, {{due to the lack of}} available data. This study overcomes this problem by accessing the financial statements for the years 2009 - 2014 of all consortia. The main conclusions of the study are: The Italian EPR system barely exceeded the technical target of the first WEEE Directive (4 kg per capita). Improvements are necessary to achieve the target set for 2019 by the Recast Directive. The economic performance of the Italian EPR regime improved significantly over time. The fees <b>charged</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> of WEEE collected decreased by almost 43 % from 652 Euro <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> in 2009 to 374 Euro <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> in 2014, while the fees <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> put on the market (P 0 M) were 134 Euro in 2009 and 104 Euro in 2014. The results prove the theory which states that, competing consortia use the learning effects to reduce the contribution fees for producers rather than to increase the quantity collected. Municipalities remain the most important actor in WEEE collection operations. Consortia compensate municipalities with a reimbursement that ranges between 28 and 38 Euros <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> collected. These repayments cover only partially their costs. Additional studies should investigate their role...|$|R

40|$|Background: Some {{doubt the}} {{desirability}} and cost-effectiveness {{of continuing to}} provide an expanded scope of primary care practice. Additionally, there has been concern about declining reimbursement from Medicaid and Medicare. Although an expanded scope of patient care services are required for training, we wanted to determine whether these services drain resources and time from other primary care activities. Methods: To determine the financial impact of deleting services other than office visits from an urban primary care practice, we tabulated charges, economic case mix, and actual collections during 12 con-secutive months. Using regional and national norms, the practice set charges for hospital services, office visits, and procedures at approximately 50 th percentile as a maximum. Common diagnostic and thera-peutic procedures were tabulated, and <b>gross</b> <b>charges</b> <b>per</b> item per year were tabulated. To validate net collection predictions for a predominately TennCare (Medicaid) practice and compare these with pro-jected net collections from private practice, charges were compared with projected collections using two expectations (40 % net and 80 % net). Overall collections were projected and then compared with actual collection. For hospital services and office procedures, costs were attributed to equipment, training, liability insurance, and lost opportunity for office visits.

40|$|Fixed wing {{agricultural}} aircraft apply approximately 40 % of the fertiliser used in New Zealand, {{the majority of}} which is applied in hill country. The amount varies from approximately 600, 000 tonnes to 1. 2 million <b>tonnes</b> <b>per</b> annum. About 100 fixed wing aircraft of various types are engaged in agricultural operations {{throughout the country and}} the safety record has been of considerable concern; the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) of New Zealand report that there are 12 serious accidents per 100, 000 flying hours which result in 4 deaths, almost 2 annually. Agricultural aviation stakeholders, including, the Department of Labour, Civil Aviation Authority, New Zealand Agricultural Aviation Association (NZAAA) and Federated Farmers are trying {{to reduce the number of}} incidents in the sector by establishing guidelines for airstrips, fertiliser storage facilities, their use and application from them. A large proportion of incidents have, as contributing factors, poor flowing product which cannot be jettisoned in time to avert an accident, collisions with obstructions near the airstrip (20 % of all accidents are aircraft hitting fences in proximity to the airstrip) and damage to aircraft due to an inappropriate surface, such as rutting. The New Zealand topdressing industry handles many products of which only a few are homogenous e. g. Urea and fresh Di-ammonium phosphate. The majority of spreading being undertaken involves products with large variations in particle size and moisture content producing particles from fine dust to concretions. These characteristics make it very difficult to achieve continuous flow and even spreading from an aircraft. There have been a disproportionate number of accidents and near misses in the New Zealand topdressing industry that have occurred whilst spreading agricultural limestone (lime). Lime has been identified as being particularly problematic and is being used as a focus for this study. Superphosphate, which is used as a flow standard in New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority rules, is used as a comparison in powder flow engineering experiments. This thesis is a prescribed project concerned with solving specific problems for industry mainly funded by the Fertiliser Manufacturers’ Research Association. Specific objectives/aims of the project: 1. Quantify the flow characteristic of products being spread and identify risks within the system, identifying risk materials and risk situations. 2. Develop a better understanding of material variability in terms of characterising the different deposits used around New Zealand and relating these differences to flow properties. 3. Develop a better understanding of the mechanisms creating the variability in flow properties that relate to production processes, transport and storage and finally loading and spreading with topdressing aircraft of the different limes used in New Zealand. 4. Quantify system performance in terms of economic and environmental impacts. 5. Identify suitable test methodologies that can be used within the industry to determine whether a product is fit for spreading and its flow characteristics. These would be dispatch tests at the lime quarry or fertiliser plant and a flowabiltiy test as the material is loaded onto the aircraft. 6. Identify design criteria that determine the performance of aircraft in relation to safety, flow control and spreading performance. Work with the interested parties to improve work quality and safety associated with agricultural aviation systems. Flow properties have been quantified using a shear testing regime and engineering design parameters established for mass flow have been calculated from interpreting the powder flow functions. However, as the material from each quarry has variations in particle size distributions caused by factors such as the moisture of the parent limestone, age of the crushing hammers and time being crushed; the results are only an instantaneous solution. All commonly used products except lime are free flowing and shear testing was undertaken on superphosphate samples as a comparison. All the limes tend to be on the cohesive – easy flow boundary. Limes from throughout New Zealand have been classified by mineralogy, have been analysed by thermal decomposition and have had impurities identified through X-ray diffraction. Although there were differences in the particle size distributions and loose and tapped bulk densities between the limes, helium pycnometry testing showed the limes to have similar particle densities. In order to achieve free flow conditions with these products they require modification. The simplest modification that proved effective was the removal of fine particles. This had the effect of reducing the particle size distribution which is important in reducing the packing density and cohesive strength. This was also achieved by only having particles within a narrow particle size range, by removing the fine particles the cohesive strength was reduced and the materials were free flowing. Although this can be done there is clearly a cost involved, the industry is already struggling with reduced demand and any increase in cost is likely to be unwelcome even though it could help to save pilots’ lives and improve the quality of spread achieved. This thesis considers three aspects of topdressing costs in order to estimate the actual costs of spreading fertiliser and lime. The questions posed are; what are the actual costs of operating the two main models of aircraft flown in New Zealand? What size of aircraft fleet is required to fulfil the spreading requirements? What are the on-farm infrastructure costs that also need to be considered in order to calculate the true costs of servicing the application of fertiliser to our hill country sector? Topdressing services mainly the sheep and beef sectors which contribute 22. 5 % of New Zealand’s agricultural output. Farm income in this sector is nearly $ 4 billion. Application of fertiliser is important to sector productivity and the possible collapse of the topdressing industry would have far reaching consequences for these farming sectors and New Zealand’s export earnings. The model finds that there is no financial return on capital invested in the industry. Therefore, the best returns are found by applying fertiliser from old aircraft with aged support vehicles all with little capital value. This is clearly unsustainable as even old aircraft require large injections of capital periodically to maintain airworthiness. As fertiliser prices have increased, application rates have fallen, which increases application cost <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> applied. The agreed fixed price charging model is traditionally based on an application <b>charge</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne.</b> It is likely that farmers perceive increased application <b>charges</b> <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> as a price increase, whereas it is only compensating the applicator for the additional time of sowing at a lower rate. It is clear that although farmers buy fertiliser on a cost <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> basis this is not the activity based cost driver for the aerial applicator. Converting the cost per hour aircraft cost driver, to a cost <b>per</b> <b>tonne</b> for <b>charging</b> farmers; is confusing as application charges alter by rate and product. The industry needs to alter its charging mechanism to a cost per aircraft flying hour activity based charging regime...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the interaction between}} airports and airline companies {{taking into account the}} evolution of air transport in the last decades and an approach to integrated quality of service. Traditionally airport management, just like all transport infrastructure management, use to look at airlines as their primary customers, due to their legally binding agreements and because airlines pay for several charges, such as landing and parking fees, <b>charges</b> <b>per</b> passenger or <b>tonne</b> of freight handled, etc. Airlines, in turn, have legally binding agreements with passengers and look at passengers as their primary clients. In their unconscious business models airports used to see themselves as providers of an high technological demanding infrastructure, of national strategic interest, for very sophisticated operations where safety played both a very distinguished and distinct role. This paper challenges this traditional airport model and discusses a renewed business model for airports. This renewed model maintains the key functions of an airport but is built in the concept of quality of service as an interactive process that encompasses all agents engaged in the provision of the service...|$|R
