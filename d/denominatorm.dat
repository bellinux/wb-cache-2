40|$|We {{consider}} the map :→ given by (x) = xx, where x denotes the smallest integer {{greater than or}} equal to x, and study the problem of finding, for each rational, the smallest number of iterations by that sends it into an integer. Given two natural numbers M and n, we prove that the set of numerators of the irreducible fractions that have <b>denominatorM</b> and whose orbits by reach an integer in exactly n iterations is a disjoint union of congruence classes modulo M^n+ 1. Moreover, we establish a finite procedure to determine them. We also describe an efficient algorithm to decide if an orbit of a rational number bigger than one fails to hit an integer until a prescribed number of iterations have elapsed, and deduce that the probability that such an orbit enters is equal to one.
