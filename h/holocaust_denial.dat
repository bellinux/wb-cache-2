In The Eleventh Hour, Tyndall spoke approvingly of Holocaust denier David Irving. In promoting <b>Holocaust</b> <b>denial,</b> Tyndall and those close to him may have been seeking to rehabilitate Hitler and the Nazi government in the British public's view.|$|E

In 2006 he was acquitted of separate charges of inciting racial hatred.

5|$|Since {{the passing}} of the <b>Holocaust</b> <b>denial</b> law in 1995, it is illegal to deny or attempt to justify the Holocaust. The act follows the Belgian Anti-Racism Law, passed in 1981, which led to the {{establishment}} of the Centre for Equal Opportunities and Opposition to Racism, which researches racism and anti-Semitism in Belgium as well as aiding victims of discrimination. Breendonk and Dossin Barracks (at the site of the former Mechelen transit camp) are preserved as museums to the Holocaust and to German repression in Belgium during the occupation.|$|E

5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on the}} scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from <b>Holocaust</b> <b>denial,</b> as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E
5000|$|The Abbott Government took a {{proposal}} to amend the Racial Discrimination Act to the 2013 Federal Election. The Government argued that the Act unduly restricted free speech in Australia, by making [...] "insult" [...] and [...] "offence" [...] the test for breach of the law. As Attorney-General, Brandis argued the case for amending the Keating Government's controversial Section 18C of the Act. In March 2013, Brandis released draft amendments for community consultation, and announced that the proposed changes would [...] "strengthen the Act's protections against racism, {{while at the same}} time removing provisions which unreasonably limit freedom of speech." [...] After community consultation, the Government was unable to secure support for changes to the Act from the Senate, and the Abbott Government shelved the proposal. The draft amendments had met with criticism from the ALP, Liberal MP Ken Wyatt, and an alliance of racial minority representatives including Jewish lobby groups concerned with <b>holocaust</b> <b>denials</b> in the media.|$|R

5000|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{his tenure}} in the California Senate Morrow {{sponsored}} the controversial [...] "Students Bill of Rights," [...] which was modeled on David Horowitz's Academic Bill of Rights. [...] Morrow introduced the bill [...] "to help protect students in our public education system from harassment and abuse." [...] However, some critics alleged that the bill's vaguely worded requirements—e.g., to respect the [...] "unsettled character" [...] of the social sciences and humanities—denied the distinction between plausible theories and implausible theories, giving theories like <b>Holocaust</b> <b>denials</b> an academic respect not warranted by the evidence." [...] This criticism was given further support when Morrow publicly claimed the bill [...] "treats all ideological perspectives the same." [...] In addition, the bill required social science and humanities faculty to [...] "provide students with dissenting sources and viewpoints." [...] Given the bill's vague criteria, some critics alleged that this requirement could be used to force faculty to cover implausible theories in their classes. [...] Though the bill gained some media attention, it never made it out of committee.|$|R
5|$|Following a {{disagreement}} with Harrington (who subsequently formed the Third Way), and objections over {{the direction the}} party was heading, in 1989, Griffin left the National Front. Along with Holland and Fiore, he helped form the International Third Position (ITP), a development of the Political Soldier movement, but left the organisation in 1990. In the same year, he lost his left eye when a discarded shotgun cartridge exploded {{in a pile of}} burning wood, since when he has worn a glass eye. The accident left him unable to work, and owing to other financial problems he subsequently petitioned for bankruptcy (the accident occurred in France, where he later lost money in a failed business project). For several years thereafter, he abstained from politics and was supported financially by his parents. He later stewarded a public <b>Holocaust</b> <b>denial</b> meeting hosted by David Irving.|$|E
5|$|Spokane and its {{metro area}} in general, {{particularly}} northern Idaho has been stigmatized {{in the popular}} consciousness {{by a number of}} hate groups that have been set up in and around Coeur d'Alene, Idaho in the past. Low ethnic diversity made the region a destination for some seeking to escape more cosmopolitan cities for a locale with a relatively homogenous, white population. This trend increased with the arrival of retired engineer Richard Butler from California who traveled to Hayden, Idaho in 1974 to eventually establish a white supremacist church called the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, better known by its political arm, the Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations recruits and associates were responsible for several hate crimes and terror plots during the mid 1980s and 1990s. The group went defunct in 2000 when the Southern Poverty Law Center filed a civil suit which resulted in a $6.3 million settlement, which led to the eventual bankruptcy and closure of their Hayden compound. Another significant act of hate was the attempted bombing of Spokane's Martin Luther King Day Parade by Kevin Harpham of Addy, Washington in 2011. The Southern Poverty Law Center currently lists three hate groups in the Spokane and Coeur d'Alene metro areas, in the categories of anti-Muslim, <b>Holocaust</b> <b>denial,</b> and general hate.|$|E

He also praised the pope for condemning anti-Semitism. However, a few months later, Prasquier criticized the Vatican for lifting the excommunication of Bishop Richard Williamson, who in an interview with Swedish television had question the extent of the <b>Holocaust.</b> “The <b>denial</b> of the Shoah is not an opinion, but a crime,” Prasquier was quoted as saying.|$|R

Hirsch (2012) defined postmemory as those memories of the Holocaust that the 'second generation' had of events that shaped their lives but took place before they were born. Post-postmemory, Karpf suggests, is the process whereby such narratives are themselves modified by subsequent events and re-readings brought about by three kinds of time - personal, historical and discursive. Although inevitable, such re-readings run the risk of encouraging <b>Holocaust</b> revisionism and <b>denial.</b> Nevertheless, Karpf claims, they are essential to maintain the post-memoir as a living text...|$|R

40|$|Visit to a Viennese Cemetary" is a {{personal}} reflection about Fireside's first trip back to Austria since his arrival in the USA. It was organised by the "Jewish Welcome Service" in September 2000. This trip brings forgotten memories back to life, questioning the role of Austrians in the <b>Holocaust,</b> and their <b>denial</b> afterwards. The author describes the trip, first days of sightseeing and conversations of his fellow travellers. On the last day, the group went to Zentralfreidhof, the main cemetery in Vienna. The memoir "Delusions and Denials: Viennese Life under the Nazis" starts {{with a description of}} the author's family and an essay-like reflection about Austria and its role and engagement with Nazism, and soon turns to the author's own childhood in Vienna, presenting his personal memories in context of the political situation in the 1930 s. In {{the main part of the}} memoir, Fireside talks at length about the immediate events leading to the "Anschluss", followed by its consecutive years, still being in Vienna. "Kristallnacht", the pogrom in November of 1938, is dealt with in detail, over 15 pages. Until their escape in April 1940, Fireside describes plenty incidents of humiliations and persecution, the process of getting affidavits for the USA, and finally his family boarding a ship in Italy and their arrival in the USA. Visit to a Viennese cemeteryDelusions and denials: Viennese life under the NazisHarvey Fireside was born under the prewar Heinz Wallner name on 12 / 18 / 1929 in Vienna.
