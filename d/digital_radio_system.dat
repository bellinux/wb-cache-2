25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} decisions regarding the design of a <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> <b>system</b> is the choice of which audio codec to use, because the efficiency of the audio codec determines how many radio stations can be carried on a multiplex at a given level of audio quality. The capacity of a DAB multiplex is fixed, so the more efficient the audio codec is, the more stations can be carried, and vice versa. Similarly, for a fixed bit-rate level, the more efficient the audio codec is the higher the audio quality will be.|$|E

50|$|SDR is an {{important}} element of SDMN, because it replaces protocol-specific radio hardware with protocol-agnostic digital transceivers.While many earlier <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> <b>systems</b> used field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) or special-purposed digital signal processors (DSPs) for calculations on baseband radio waveforms, the SDMN approach moves all of the baseband processing into general-purpose CPUs.SDMN <b>radio</b> <b>systems</b> also use hardware with publicly-documented interfaces that is designed to be readily reproducible by multiple manufacturers.|$|R

50|$|Digital audio {{broadcasting}} standards {{may provide}} terrestrial or satellite <b>radio</b> service. <b>Digital</b> <b>radio</b> broadcasting <b>systems</b> are typically designed for handheld mobile devices, just like mobile-TV systems, but {{as opposed to}} other digital TV systems which typically require a fixed directional antenna. Some <b>digital</b> <b>radio</b> <b>systems</b> provide in-band on-channel (IBOC) solutions that may coexist with or simulcast with analog AM or FM transmissions, while others are designed for designated radio frequency bands. The latter allows one wideband radio signal to carry a multiplex consisting of several radio-channels of variable bitrate as well as data services {{and other forms of}} media. Some digital broadcasting systems allow single-frequency network (SFN), where all terrestrial transmitters in a region sending the same multiplex of radio programs may use the same frequency channel without self-interference problems, further improving the system spectral efficiency.|$|R
