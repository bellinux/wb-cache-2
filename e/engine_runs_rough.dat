The 1974 Model was extensively modified with a revised sump and does not suffer from reliability issues.|$|R

40|$|The need {{to ensure}} {{diversity}} in energy supply and its long-term sustainability necessitated the quest for renewable energy sources. Jatropha biodiesel is a renewable energy source {{that can be used}} to <b>run</b> a diesel <b>engine</b> without any modification to the engine. This work investigated the endurance characteristics of a compression ignition <b>engine</b> <b>run</b> on Jatropha biodiesel in comparison to fossil diesel. Results of the investigation indicate that an <b>engine</b> <b>run</b> on Jatropha biodiesel blends could endure longer hours of operation due to lower engine operating temperatures, than when it is run on diesel fuel. The maximum engine temperature recorded when the <b>engine</b> was <b>run</b> on diesel fuel was 161 oC. Whereas, the maximum engine temperature recorded when it was run on the Jatropha biodiesel blends was 147 oC. However, an <b>engine</b> <b>run</b> on Jatropha biodiesel blends would result to more frequent choking of oil filters and earlier lubrication oil change...|$|R
