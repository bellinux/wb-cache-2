2500|$|Edward Brass had no son and Lawrence's father James {{had died}} in 1918 so a deepened {{friendship}} between the young rancher and veteran cattleman became a strong business bond. When a buyer carrying a Brass and Meyers checkbook loaded them in 1929 with 14,000 head of Texas yearlings, Brass depended on Bixby to find the rangeland. The ranch leases that Bixby negotiated and held included 10,000 acres from Emmett Green, 10,000 acres at Spring Lake, a lease from Lester Hull on the Old Overton at 30,000 acres, the 19,000 acre Coffee Ranch on Leander Creek near Merriman and 20 sections on the Old Matador Ranch west of Kyle, South Dakota near Bear Creek. Edward Brass died in 1929, leaving Meyers in full control of the Sandhills corporation. In the late 1920s with Bixby running 12,000 head of Brass and Meyers hereford cattle, 3000 head of his own hereford's and a large draft and quarter remuda the ranch prospered but during the depression of the 1930s, Meyers reduced the company's total number of cattle and Bixby's 13-year relationship with the Sandhills Corporation ended in 1937. [...] "In the fall of 1937, I turned back 6,200 head of Sugar Bowl cattle. Ed Brass was dead, E.P. Meyers and Frank Wagoner were gone and the big Brass and Meyers deal was about over. We had 3,000 cows, 25,000 acres of the Spade and all I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> was could I ever pay for it. Ed Brass was a great teacher and cowman. I tried to do everything that way he taught me, and I owe him a lot." [...] Bixby said. By 1940 Bixby {{had been able to}} regain 40 square miles (100 km2) of original Spade Ranch range, including the home valley headquarters.|$|E

6000|$|But {{what reason}} {{was there to}} think them false? One quarter, perhaps, of America had been explored, and yet in that quarter two empires had been already found, {{in a state of}} mechanical, military, and {{agricultural}} civilization superior, in many things, to any nation of Europe. Was it not most rational to suppose that in the remaining three-quarters similar empires existed? If a second Mexico had been discovered in the mountains of Parima, and a second Peru in those of Brazil, what right would any man have <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder?</b> As for the gold legends, nothing was told of Manoa which had not been seen in Peru and Mexico by the bodily eyes of men then living. Why should not the rocks of Guiana have been as full of the precious metals (we do not know yet that they are not) as the rocks of Peru and Mexico were known to be? Even the details of the story, its standing on a lake, for instance, bore a probability with them. Mexico actually stood in the centre of a lake--why should not Manoa? The Peruvian worship centred round a sacred lake--why not that of Manoa? Pizarro and Cortez, again, were led on to their desperate enterprises by the sight of small quantities of gold among savages, who told them of a civilized gold-country near at hand; and they found that those savages spoke truth. Why was the unanimous report of the Carib tribes of the Orinoco to be disbelieved, when they told a similar tale? Sir Richard Schomburgk's admirable preface to Raleigh's Guiana proves, surely, that the Indians themselves were deceived, as well as deceivers. It was known, again, that vast quantities of the Peruvian treasure had been concealed by the priests, and that members of the Inca family had fled across the Andes, and held out against the Spaniards. Barely fifty years had elapsed since then;--what more probable than that this remnant of the Peruvian dynasty and treasure still existed? Even the story of the Amazons, though it may serve Hume as a point for his ungenerous and untruthful attempt to make Raleigh out either fool or villain, has come from Spaniards, who had with their own eyes seen the Indian women fighting by their husbands' sides, and from Indians, who asserted the existence of an Amazonian tribe. What right had Amyas, or any man, to disbelieve the story? The existence of the Amazons in ancient Asia, and of their intercourse with Alexander the Great, was then an accredited part of history, which it would have been gratuitous impertinence to deny. And what if some stories connected these warlike women with the Emperor of Manoa, and the capital itself? This generation ought surely to be the last to laugh at such a story, at least as long as the Amazonian guards of the King of Dahomey continue to outvie the men in that relentless ferocity, with which they have subdued every neighboring tribe, save the Christians of Abbeokuta. In this case, as in a hundred more, fact not only outdoes, but justifies imagination; and Amyas spoke common sense when he said to his men that day-- ...|$|E

You can't fault it, because the characters are real." [...] Kaluta dismissed gender categorizers by saying of the Starstruck characters, [...] "They're people that don't pander to what you're expecting a female character in a science fiction play or comic book to be, they're just people.

50|$|One {{can argue}} that one title is missing here. The 1995 National No.1 Pro, {{for the fact that}} Lévêque {{actually}} had won the title based on the points total alone. The controversy involved with the title is that it went to the points runner up Gary Ellis. The actual points winner, after soundly defeating the competition in the 1995 ABA Grand National was the Frenchman, Christophe Lévêque. However, he was not awarded the title nor the automobile prize that went with it due to an obscure rule in the ABA rule book that you must be an American citizen to win the ABA No.1 Pro title. One <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> why did they let him race and collect points throughout the season in the first place if this was the set rule. Despite the flagrant violation of common sense, the rule stood since, according to another ABA rule, you cannot change the rules during a race season. Consequently, Lévêque was disqualified and Ellis was rewarded the title. This non-foreigner rule was revoked almost as soon as the 1995 season ended. Lévêque however did know about the rule in advance of the Grandnationals, as did his sponsor Sunn-Chipie but raced the ABA national circuit anyway. After his non-win, Sunn-Chipie treated him as if he did win the ABA National No.1 Pro title anyway and awarded him a bonus. The ABA in removing that regulation helped open the gate for a flood of non-Americans to win the title of No.1 Pro ever since. The title of ABA National #1 Pro has been held by non US citizens six times beginning with and since the 1996 season, including twice for Lévêque, in 1998 and 1999. Ironically given its much greater international connections, the NBL National #1 Pro title has been only been in foreign hands for four times in the same time period.|$|E
50|$|This enabled Cork {{to build}} {{themselves}} a winning lead {{and hold on}} to survive the best challenges Galway offered. Only the impressive scoring formm of Nevin kept Galway in touch, leaving them four points down at half time, 2-7 to 0-9. Ian O'Riordan wrote in the Irish Times:Lynn Dunlea was simply outstanding at full forward, drilling over nine points, six from frees, and proving once again how games can be won or lost with dependable free-takers. Added to that was the firepower of Irene O'Keeffe, whose two goals {{in the first half}} had Galway constantly playing catch-up afterwards. Last year’s captain, Linda Mellerick, was once again a marvel at midfield and even though she only once made the scoreboard, she created plenty of scores. Considering Mellerick had planned to retire after last season's victory, you just <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> where she continues to get her energy and enthusiasm.”Jim O'Sullivan, who described Mellerick’s performance as her “her best ever in the red and white” wrote in the Irish Examiner:This was a victory for grit and determination, a never-say-die attitude that many a male side could copy and an absolute will to win that will set this team apart from all the others. Picture the scene: Cork, who could only manage a four-point (2-7 to 0-9) half time lead after playing with the driving wind and rain, were battling with their backs to the wall and a point in front with four minutes to go, as Galway threw everything at them in search of the winning goal. Yet, the Leesiders found reserves of strength to weather the storm and finish with two match-winning points from Lyn Dunlea to give the county its 19th title, and their second in a row over the westerners.The double goal scorer O'Keeffe said:We always thought that there wouldn't be much more in it than a couple of goals. They kept coming at us alright but our back line was very strong and that made a big difference in the end. Winning again against Galway adds a little extra buzz because they're probably our greatest rivals at the moment.|$|E
5000|$|In 1909 Bartlett Richards bought 20,000 head {{of cattle}} from Mexico and in November of that year a very strong snow storm {{incapacitated}} the area. [...] "The Spade lost 10,000 of those cattle," [...] Lawrence said, [...] "and there was a pile of hides in Ellsworth {{as high as the}} depot." [...] Lawrence and his brother Ona skinned cattle for 50 cents a head, 25 cents per calf and everyday the intense cold brought more losses to the Spade. When Lawrence was old enough to file on a homestead, he described his land on the Alkali Lake Meadow as a quarter-mile deep and two miles wide, but he met requirements and received patent on the string of 40's in 1918. In 1925 Brass and Meyers arranged with Lawrence to buy the hay and have him care for and feed their cattle which were branded with Sandhills Land and Cattle Company's Sugar Bowl brand. Early on, Brass assisted Bixby with a $2,000.00 ($24,031.37 current) down payment on a loan to buy 2,000 acres (810 ha) of the Spade land. [...] Beginning in 1925, Bixby slowly began to obtain sections of the old Spade Ranch range by hard work and perseverance, aided by bankers willing to take a chance. In 1926, Brass and Meyers suggested Bixby move to the ranch headquarters in the Spade home valley. The same year Lawrence was asked by the Union Pacific assistant treasurer C.T. Cullen for permission to bring a hunting party to the Spade and {{for a number of years}} the men came in a private railroad car, bringing their own cook and paid handsomely for hunting rights on Bixby land and lakes. Mr. Cullen dropped by the day Lawrence was checking applications for the district school, where he was a board member. [...] "Hire this one with the Irish eyes," [...] Mr. Cullen suggested and in time Miss Eleanor Riordan of York, Nebraska began teaching Cherry County District #168. Lawrence conscientiously kept in touch with the young teacher and the day after her term ended they were married in Alliance, Nebraska on May 26, 1927.Edward Brass had no son and Lawrence's father James had died in 1918 so a deepened friendship between the young rancher and veteran cattleman became a strong business bond. When a buyer carrying a Brass and Meyers checkbook loaded them in 1929 with 14,000 head of Texas yearlings, Brass depended on Bixby to find the rangeland. The ranch leases that Bixby negotiated and held included 10,000 acres from Emmett Green, 10,000 acres at Spring Lake, a lease from Lester Hull on the Old Overton at 30,000 acres, the 19,000 acre Coffee Ranch on Leander Creek near Merriman and 20 sections on the Old Matador Ranch west of Kyle, South Dakota near Bear Creek.

40|$|A land of plenty, or plenty in the land, asks Peter Mares in Griffith Review   DAYS ARE {{numbered}} for the Monday morning Mernda market. Last year, after operating {{for more}} than a century, the weekly livestock auction shut down. A few traders still sell live chicks, layer pullets and ducks from wire cages, and other signs of the market’s rural origins survive in stalls offering second-hand agricultural implements, bales of lucerne hay or boxes of locally grown red peppers. But the wooden saleyards are collapsing in disrepair, the corrugated roofing is decaying to rust and {{there is no longer any}} bidding on cattle, sheep or goats – the auction that originally gave people reason to gather each Monday at the rear of Mernda’s Bridge Inn Hotel (c. 1891). What remains is a scruffy trash-and-treasure market increasingly populated by professional traders retailing fruit and veg bought wholesale in the city, or the same toyshop junk and cheap Chinese socks found in a two-dollar shop. A few ruddy blokes in broad-brimmed hats perched at the plastic table next to the dim sim van cannot hide the fact that Mernda no longer belongs to the ring of countryside draped around Melbourne – it is being tucked firmly into the city’s mortgage belt. On the morning of my visit, just over the ridge line from the market three aquamarine excavators waved dinosaur necks, digging trenches for sewerage pipes, while a yellow bulldozer smoothed flat the land between ancient gums. The wooden skeletons of house frames stood like bleached bones against a thick grey sky. This is Renaissance Rise, one of several new housing estates being built in and around Mernda. Nearby are Woodland Waters (alliteration is big in real estate) and Mernda Villages. A woman who had driven down from Bright to sell chestnuts from a van told me that the muddy patch of land where the market is held had also been sold to developers. Traders had been warned, she said, that they will have to move on when work begins on the site. Mernda is about an hour’s drive from central Melbourne, north up the Plenty Valley. It is in one of the urban growth corridors extending out from the city like the fingers of a splayed hand. Soon after we passed La Trobe University and RMIT’s Bundoora campus, evidence of land sales and subdivisions appeared on the roadside in the form of banners, bunting and billboards. ‘More Nature’ promised one advertisement for Renaissance Rise. ‘More Open Space’ pledged the next. To underline the attractions of Mernda, both billboards were fringed at the base with tall, luxuriant fronds of fake green grass. Irony is not a characteristic of real estate promotion, but I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> if a tongue was firmly in a cheek when the copywriter came up with the line on the next billboard: ‘Kiss the urban sprawl goodbye. ’ The new subdivisions deliver the opposite of a rural lifestyle. Messy paddocks have been converted into regulation-size plots. Tangled fences have given way to precise kerbing and Astroturf nature strips. The border markers of the estates are not rusty wire gates but monumental stone walls framing the entrance road. When I visited the display homes at Mernda Villages, I was acutely aware that Mernda will be anything but a village once all the sites are sold, the houses built and the homes occupied. The double-storey luxury-model residence had four bedrooms, three with ensuite bathrooms and walk-in robes of generous proportions. The kitchen presented acres of granite bench tops and dazzled with gleaming appliances; there was a breakfast bar and a formal dining area, four separate lounge rooms (‘living’, ‘family’, ‘leisure’ and ‘rumpus’), a study and a covered deck built around the shrine of an industrial-scale hooded barbeque. ‘Five-star resort living in a home that is pleasantly affordable and great for growing families,’ burbled a young man’s voice piped through every room. Construction costs on the two-storey model start at $ 286, 500. Throw in another $ 220, 000 for land and your dream home can be built to order in eighteen weeks for less than half a million dollars. Construction starts at $ 196, 000 for the more modest, single-storey residence, which still boasts multiple living areas, a master bedroom with ensuite and walk-in robe and double garage as standard. The building extends to the very edge of the block. There was a narrow strip of lawn and a palm-fringed garden bed in the display, but I could not help wondering where I would hang out the washing. Mernda Villages may promise ‘life surrounded by nature’, with ‘sustainably planned’ conservation zones, rain gardens and spacious parklands full of native trees and flora, but the future residents of Mernda Villages won’t be going to the Monday market to purchase young layers for a backyard chook shed. It is easy to be snide. Having entered the property market twenty years ago, my wife and I now live comfortably in a suburb within easy bike-riding distance of the city centre. There is not enough room for chooks, but we have space to hang out the washing and to grow basil and tomatoes in summer, broad beans in winter. We are well served by public transport (bus, tram and train) and it’s a short walk to parks, schools, shopping and good coffee. While not as spacious as the homes on display on Mernda, our house would once have accommodated a bigger tribe than our one-child family, and it has almost tripled in value since we bought it ten years ago. On paper we might be millionaires, but if we were trying to buy in the same suburb today we would be lucky to secure a one-bedroom apartment with parking for the same price as the most luxurious two-storey house and land package we looked at in Mernda. As we toured the display homes I asked myself where we would end up living if we were trying to buy our first home in the current market. A friendly salesman extolled the virtues of country life – though he admitted to living further west, in Sunbury, along another of Melbourne’s stretching suburban fingers. ‘It’s much safer than the inner-city,’ he said. ‘There is no crime, no theft, no need to lock your door. ’ (I refrained from asking him why all the display homes were equipped with burglar alarms.) The people moving to Mernda are not just young families and first home-buyers, he explained, but also empty-nesters cashing in the family home to move to something smaller, or seeking new pastures because established suburbs closer to the city, like Greensborough, are ‘getting a bit too built-up’. Marketing brochures promise that Mernda will soon have its own Village Centre with local shopping, making it ‘ideal for those seeking a convenient lifestyle without compromise’. A new Catholic primary school has been built, a state school and a childcare centre are under construction, and there is a secondary college just a few minutes’ drive away. There is no mention of public transport, though Mernda is included on two privately run bus routes. I asked my wife to drop me at the bus stop back near the Bridge Inn Hotel. Unfortunately I had just missed the 12. 32 pm to Greensborough. The next service was at 1. 13. As I sat at the shelter in front a billboard promising ‘elevated land with stunning views’, there was a steady rumble of trucks carrying construction materials and equipment to the new subdivisions. A lone council worker in a fluoro-orange jacket used tongs to collect butts from the grassy verges of Plenty Road. Eventually a young man in a black T-shirt joined me at the stop. He had just moved out from Greensborough, after buying land and building a house, and he was commuting to the city for only the second time. He hadn’t actually bought in Mernda, as planned, but a few kilometres east, towards Doreen. ‘What I didn’t realise is that we’ve ended up exactly halfway between two bus stops,’ he said. ‘It’s a fifteen-minute walk to the nearest stop, either way. ’ When I asked him why he bought there, he looked at me like I was a bit simple. ‘It’s cheap,’ he replied. ‘We’re on a budget, mate. ’ He buried his head in some lecture notes. The Dyson’s bus arrived ten minutes late and carried us towards the city. The key stops are at shopping centres ringed by car parks: University Hill, Axis Homemaker Centre, Rivergum Village. After a half-hour journey we were deposited at Greensborough Station, just in time to miss the 1. 48 to Flinders Street. There was a fifteen-minute wait until the next train. As it pulled out of the station I stared through scratched glass at the leafy, undulating suburb, looking into sloping backyards, with lawns, shrubs, vegetable gardens, even the odd chook shed. I contemplated whether a move from Greensborough to Mernda might mean less open space, not more. I arrived at Flinders Street about two hours after being dropped off at the bus stop. My wife made the trip by car in less than half the time. No wonder there were hardly any passengers on the bus. Read the full text of Peter Mares essay at Griffith Review or Download the PD...|$|E

It's safe to say {{there will be many}} more thousand-mile nights in his future as he takes these songs across the country and around the world, {{bringing}} beauty and truth and silver linings wherever he goes, [...] "driving all night," [...] as he sings, [...] "on a little bit of faith." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{questioned}} on {{the importance}} that he attaches to this number, Drummond has been evasive, responding enigmatically [...] "I know. But I'm not going to tell, because then other people would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> and the thing about beauty is for other people <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> at it. It's not very beautiful once you know." [...] Drummond's penchant for living by numbers has also been observed in his choosing to align the ages at which he undertook creative projects The Man and 45 with the standard revolution speeds of a turntable (33.3 and 45 rpm).|$|R
5000|$|Mr Regan also {{commented on}} the actions of ANZ Bank. He said that ANZ's {{decision}} to foreclose on the loan a week after issuing it {{raised questions about the}} bank's motives. [...] "One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> whether the ANZ Bank's loss of appetite for continued support <b>had</b> anything <b>to</b> {{do with the fact that}} they had got the long sought-after change to the AMSLA (Australian Master Securities Lending Agreement) on March 20." ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The New York Times film critic Stephen Holden called Noise [...] "a one-trick film that rapidly wears out its welcome." [...] Holden said the film [...] "is shallow and loud" [...] and [...] "lurches unsteadily between drama and comedy." [...] Holden wrote [...] "Its performances are discordant" [...] and said [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>to</b> what degree Mr. Robbins, an actor {{famous for his}} political activism, is here simply because he shares Mr. Bean's outrage." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to John Cassidy, {{staff writer}} at The New Yorker, Clinton, up to a point, took a populist tone: While {{many of you}} are working {{multiple}} jobs to make ends meet, you see the top twenty-five hedge-fund managers making more than all of America's kindergarten teachers combined. And often paying a lower tax rate. So, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> ‘When does my hard work pay off? When does my family get ahead? When?’ ...|$|R
5000|$|The film had {{a widely}} {{negative}} reception. Beyond Hollywood said [...] "the {{film is a}} complete loss, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> what the filmmakers could have done with a better script, a better cast, and a director who isn’t so hit-and-miss as to be infuriating." [...] Aaron Peck of Blog Critics said, [...] "I really wanted to like this movie. The first Scorpion King is a laugh-fest yes, but it’s fun to watch. This movie is painful." ...|$|R
5000|$|Weeks {{before the}} announcement, PopMatters {{magazine}} wrote, [...] "One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder</b> {{how long it}} will be before we hear the inevitable [...] "the industry ate me up" [...] stories from Vanessa Carlton. Perhaps when this record fails to outsell her debut and A&M drops her?". The Herald & Review said that Carlton [...] "became another one of the new millennium’s poster children for what happens when music labels are taken over by accountants and artist development is abandoned." ...|$|R
50|$|One <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>wonder,</b> if {{politics}} {{played a}} significant role in this decision. The majority in the government (but minority of the Regia Marina) favored development of capital ships, so allocated resources went mainly into this area, including unnecessary rebuilding of old era heavy cruisers, or extending their service, but reducing financing to scientific and technical developments, and production of ammunition. In 1935 Albatros was reclassified as a second-line ship, and was assigned to Regia Marina's naval experimental unit at La Spezia.|$|R
