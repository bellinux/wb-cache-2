5|$|The loyalists {{reached the}} home of Ma Tuyen in the Chinese {{business}} district of Cholon. Ma Tuyen was a Chinese merchant and friend who {{was reported to be}} Nhu's main contact with the Chinese syndicates which controlled the opium trade. The brothers sought asylum from the embassy of the Republic of China, but were turned down and stayed in Ma Tuyen's house as they appealed to ARVN loyalists and attempted to negotiate with the coup leaders. Nhu's secret agents had fitted the home with a direct phone line to the palace, so the insurgent generals believed that the brothers were still besieged inside Gia Long. Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building. Minh was reported to be mortified when he realised that Diệm and Nhu had escaped during the night.|$|E
25|$|The Board of Directors of the Boston and Lowell Railroad, {{armed with}} a charter, now had the task of {{surveying}} and building the line. They brought in James Fowle Baldwin, son of Col. Loammi Baldwin, who had engineered the Middlesex Canal, to do the surveying, and charged him with finding a gently sloped path from Lowell to Boston, with few grade crossings and well away from town centers. This latter point ended up being quite inconvenient later on. No one <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of the future possibility of railroads acting as public transportation, or if they did they were not paid any attention by the builders or financiers of the road.|$|E

Neither the rebels nor the loyalist Presidential Guard <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> that at 21:00 they were about to fight for an empty building, leading to futile deaths. Diệm and Nhu refused to surrender, so the 5th Division of Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu besieged the palace and captured it by dawn.|$|E

500|$|Lyon's Inn was [...] "a {{place of}} {{considerable}} antiquity", with records from 1413. Originally a hostel, it {{was purchased by}} the inhabitants and turned into an Inn of Chancery. Initially a small but respected Inn that educated people as noted as Sir Edward Coke, Lyon's Inn became a disreputable institution that [...] "perished of public contempt long before {{it came to the}} hammer and the pick". By the time it was dissolved it was inhabited only by the lowest lawyers and those struck off the rolls, and when surveyed it was found that it was run by only two Ancients, neither of whom <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> what their duties were, and the Inn had not dined for over a century. The Inn was dissolved in 1863 and replaced with the third Globe Theatre.|$|E

[...] Blanchard, nicknamed [...] "Little Doc" [...] due to his father's occupation, attended high school at Saint Stanislaus College in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. He led the school's football team, the Rockachaws, to an undefeated season during his senior year in 1941. Blanchard was recruited to play college football by Army, Fordham University and the University of Notre Dame, among others. Blanchard said in 1985 {{that he had been}} contacted about going to West Point when he was in high school. He said, [...] "At that point in time, I really wasn’t interested. Academically, I never was too hot, so I never <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> I would pass the entrance examination and go to West Point." ...|$|E

2500|$|Heaney {{planned on}} the 2002 Salt Lake Games being her final tournament. She ended her {{international}} career with an Olympic gold medal after Canada defeated the United States 3–2 in the final. The final was controversial as the American referee called 13 {{of the final}} 16 penalties in the game against Canada. Heaney described {{the feeling of the}} Canadian players following the game: [...] "We got an unbelievable number of penalties. We never <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> that could happen.

2500|$|The {{identity}} of Kalibangan as a pre-historic site {{was discovered by}} Luigi Pio Tessitori, an Italian Indologist (1887–1919). He was doing some research in ancient Indian texts. He {{was surprised by the}} character of ruins in that area, and he sought help from Sir John Marshall of the Archaeological Survey of India. At that time ASI had some excavations done on Harappa, but they never <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> about the character of the ruins. In fact, Tessitori is the first person to recognize that the ruins are 'Prehistoric' and [...] pre-Mauryan. Luigi Pio Tessitori also pointed out the nature of the culture, but at that time {{it was not possible to}} guess that Indus Valley Civilisation lay in the ruins of Kalibangan, and he died five years before Harappan culture was duly recognized.|$|E
2500|$|NBC Radio scapegoated West for the {{incident}} and banned her (and {{the mention of}} her name) from their stations. They claimed {{it was not the}} content of the skit, but West's tonal inflections that gave it the controversial context, acting as though they had hired West knowing nothing of her previous work, nor <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> of how she would deliver the lines written for her by Oboler. West would not perform in radio for a dozen years, until January 1950, in an episode of The Chesterfield Supper Club, which was hosted by Perry Como. Ameche's career did not suffer any serious repercussions, however, as he was playing the [...] "straight" [...] guy.

I told her if you want to just do a girl/girl scene, we can do that. She said she wanted to work with Kylie Ireland, so I set it up. When the sex started, she just fucking rocked! I knew Jenna was special right off the bat. I figured she'd be the next Ginger Lynn, but nobody <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> {{she was going to be}} as big as she turned out to be.

2500|$|Hitler {{began to}} {{distance}} himself from the book after becoming chancellor of Germany in 1933.

[...] Nevertheless, Mein Kampf was a bestseller in Germany during the 1930s. During Hitler's years in power, the book was in high demand in libraries and often reviewed and quoted in other publications. It was given free to every newlywed couple and every soldier fighting at the front. [...] By 1939 it had sold 5.2 million copies in eleven languages. By the end of the war, about 10 million copies of the book had been sold or distributed in Germany.|$|E
2500|$|At the time, {{the rebels}} {{had yet to}} {{completely}} surround Duchang, so Taishi Ci managed to sneak past the enemy at night and enter the fortress to meet Kong Rong.

Kong Rong wanted to seek help from Liu Bei, the Chancellor of Pingyuan State (平原國; around present-day Pingyuan, Shandong), but no one <b>had</b> <b>any</b> <b>idea</b> on how {{to break out of}} the siege. Taishi Ci volunteered to fight his way out and seek reinforcements from Liu Bei, but Kong Rong said, [...] "The rebels have completely surrounded the fortress. Everyone thinks it is impossible to break out. It will be very difficult for you to break out no matter how courageous you are." [...] Taishi Ci replied, [...] "When I was away, you treated my mother very generously. She feels grateful, hence she told me to help you. She knew that I know what I am doing, and that I can help you. Now, everyone says it is impossible to break out. If I were to agree with them, I will not be able to repay your kindness. Why, then, did my mother send me here for? We are in a very desperate situation. I hope you won't hesitate any longer." [...] Kong Rong agreed to let him break out of the siege.|$|E
