40|$|Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), an <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogen,</b> causes female rats {{to be more}} {{susceptible}} to liver tumor formation than males. HCB exposure in females downregulates the expression of Cx 32, a gap junction protein, through the activation of Akt. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine (1) the implication of different regions of the hepatic Cx 32 promoter in the observed sexual dimorphism in the expression of Cx 32, (2) the implication of different regions of the hepatic Cx 32 promoter in the HCBinduced downregulation of Cx 32 in female rat liver, and (3) if HCB exposure modulates the binding of transcription factors on the Cx 32 promoter through Akt activation. Male and female rats were exposed to HCB during 5 consecutive days and sampled 45 days later. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays showed that the intensity of only one nuclear protein–DNA complex differed between males and females. The formation of this comple...|$|E
40|$|Hexachlorobenzene (HCB) is an <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogen</b> that is {{persistent}} in {{the environment}} and {{has a tendency to}} bio-accumulate. HCB is stored in fatty tissues of animais and humans. When rats are exposed to HCB, females are more susceptible to develop tumors as compared to males. The genes responsible for such an expression are poorly understood. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the gender-specific hepatic gene expression profiles observed in rats exposed to HCB. Four experimental groups were used; control males; control females; HCB-treated males and HCB-treated females. Treated rats were exposed to HCB (100 mg/kg) for five consecutive days and sampled on day 50 of the experiment. The in vivo exposure model used in the present study in which rats are sampled at day 50 represents a "steady state" situation following from HCB exposure. Total RNA was isolated from the liver and reverse transcribed and used to screen an Atlas™ 1. 2 II Rat Array containing 1176 genes. Data were analyzed using four individual rats per experimental group. Genes expressed in at least 3 out of 4 trials were selected for analysis. In addition, the genes must have had signal intensities at least 2 X background level. Our data indicates a sexual dimorphism in the expression of hepatic genes due to HCB-treatment. The female control group displayed comparable gene expression as the male control group (185 versus 184 genes). Seven genes were exclusively found in the male control group; ERp 29, synaptogyrin 1, synaptojanin, DPPIII, kinesin-related protein, atrophin 1 and glycoprotein 55. Two genes were exclusively expressed in females; Mammalian achaete scute homolog 2 (MASH- 2) and carboxypeptidase z. In HCB-treated males a total of 189 genes were detected by the eDNA microarray. Four of those genes had significant differentiai expressions; EGR 2, dihydropyrimidinase and a liver-specific transport protein were down-regulated while epoxide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the biotransformation of xenobiotics and epoxides was up-regulated. No genes were exclusively expressed in HCB-treated females. However, HCB caused an 18...|$|E
40|$|Arsenicals in agriculture. Beginning in the 1970 s, the use {{of arsenic}} {{compounds}} for such purposes as wood preservatives, began to grow. By 1980, in the USA, 70 % of arsenic had been consumed {{for the production of}} wood preservatives. This practice was later stopped, due to the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ban of the arsenic-and chromium-based wood preservative chromated copper arsenate. In the past, arsenical herbicides containing cacodylic acid as an active ingredient have been used extensively in the USA, from golf courses to cotton fields, and drying-out the plants before harvesting. The original commercial form of Agent Blue was among 10 toxic insecticides, fungicides and herbicides partially deregulated by the US EPA in February 2004, and specific limits on toxic residues in meat, milk, poultry and eggs, were removed. Today, however, they are no longer used as weed-killers, with one exception – monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA), a broadleaf weed herbicide for use on cotton. Severe poisonings from cacodylic acid caused headache, dizziness, vomiting, profuse and watery diarrhea, followed by dehydration, gradual fall in blood pressure, stupor, convulsions, general paralysis and possible risk of death within 3 – 14 days. The relatively frequent use of arsenic and its compounds in both industry and agriculture points to a wide spectrum of opportunities for human exposure. This exposure can be via inhalation of airborne arsenic, contaminated drinking water, beverages, or from food and drugs. Today, acute organic arsenical poisonings are mostly accidental. Considerable concern has developed surrounding its delayed effects, for its genotoxic and carcinogenic potential, which has been demonstrated in epidemiological studies and subsequent animal experiments. Conclusions. There is substantial epidemiological evidence for an excessive risk, mostly for skin and lung cancer, among humans exposed to organic arsenicals in occupational and environmental settings. Furthermore, the genotoxic and carcinogenic effects have only been observed at relatively high exposure rates. Current epidemiological and experimental studies are attempting to elucidate the mechanism of this action, pointing to the question whether arsenic is actually a true genotoxic, or rather an <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogen.</b> Due to the complexity of its effects, both options remain plausible. Its interactions with other toxic substances still represent another important field of interest...|$|E
30|$|Exposure to estrogens is a known {{risk factor}} for {{developing}} cancer. The scientific community predominantly considers estrogens to be <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> because these compounds do not induce mutations in standard bacterial and mammalian test systems. This presumably occurs because the reactive catechol estrogen quinone metabolites are not formed or cannot reach the target DNA [1 – 5]. These results have led scientists to classify estrone (E 1) and estradiol (E 2) as <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> that function by stimulating abnormal cell proliferation via estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated processes [5 – 10]. These latter events can accelerate the process of carcinogenesis, but do not play the critical role in cancer initiation because the hypothetical mutations obtained are random.|$|R
25|$|Nongenotoxic, or <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> are {{different}} and slightly more ambiguous than genotoxic carcinogens {{since they are}} not directly carcinogenic. Nongenotoxic carcinogens act by secondary mechanisms that do not directly damage genes. This type of carcinogenesis {{does not change the}} sequence of DNA; instead it alters the expression or repression of certain genes by a wide variety of cellular processes. Since these toxicants do not directly act on DNA, {{little is known about the}} mechanistic pathway. It has been proposed that modification of gene expression from nongenotoxic carcinogens can occur by oxidative stress, peroxisome proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, alteration of intercellular communication, and modulation of metabolizing enzymes.|$|R
40|$|Chemieals that induce {{cancer in}} an intact {{organism}} are called carcinogens. This term does not differentiale between their various modes of action. In this review, Werner Lutz and Peter Maier make a mechanistic distinction between carcinogens that alter the genetic information and carcinogens {{that interfere with}} epigenetic processes. They considercardnogenesis tobe an ongoing, part 1 y unavoidable process {{which is based on}} a succession of mutations, most likely in stem cells, leading to autonomaus cellular growth regulation.

40|$|Direct {{communication}} between hepatocytes, mediated by gap junctions, constitutes a major regulatory platform {{in the control}} of liver homeostasis, ranging from hepatocellular proliferation to hepatocyte cell death. Inherent to this pivotal task, gap junction functionality is frequently disrupted upon impairment of the homeostatic balance, as occurs during liver toxicity and carcinogenicity. In the present paper, the deleterious effects {{of a number of}} chemical and biological toxic compounds on hepatic gap junctions are discussed, including environmental pollutants, biological toxins, organic solvents, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, peroxides, metals and phthalates. Particular attention is paid to the molecular mechanisms that underlie the abrogation of gap junction functionality. Since hepatic gap junctions are specifically targeted by tumor promoters and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> both in vivo and in vitro, inhibition of gap junction functionality is considered as a suitable indicator for the detection of nongenotoxic hepatocarcinogenicity...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} it has been {{hypothesized}} that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are the actual driving force of tumor formation, highlighting the need to specifically target CSCs to successfully eradicate cancer growth and recurrence. Particularly, the deregulation of physiological signaling pathways controlling stem cell proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and metabolism is currently considered {{as one of the}} leading determinants of cancer formation. Given their peculiar, slow-dividing phenotype and their ability to respond to multiple microenvironmental stimuli, stem cells appear to be more susceptible to genetic and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens,</b> possibly undergoing mutations resulting in tumor formation. In particular, some animal-derived bioactive nutrients and metabolites known to affect the hormonal milieu, and also chemicals derived from food processing and cooking, have been described as possible carcinogenic factors. Here, we review most recent literature in this field, highlighting how some environmental toxicants, some specific nutrients and their secondary products can induce carcinogenesis, possibly impacting stem cells and their niches, thus causing tumor growt...|$|R
40|$|Data {{supporting}} various dose-respome {{relationships in}} chemical carcinogenesis are summarized. General principles are derived {{to explain the}} relationships between exposure dose, JI>NA adduct Ievel, induction of genetic changes, and tumor incidence. Some mechanistic aspects of <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> (stimulation of ceU division and maldlfl'erentlation) are analyzed in a similar way. In a bomogeneous pnpulation, non-linearities are frequent. They are due to pbenomena of induction or saturation of enzymatic activities and to the multi-step nature of carcinog~: if a carcinogen acce 1 erates more than one step, the SUperposition of the dose- response curves for the indJvidual steps can result in an exponential relationship. A fourth power of the dose was the maximum seen in animals (fonnaldehyde). At the lowest dose Ievels, a proportionality between dose and tumor induction is postulated independent of the mechanism of action if the carcinogen aceeierotes the endogenous proass responsible for spootaneous tumor formation. Low-dose thresholds are expected only for situations where the carcinogen acts {{in a way that}} has no endogenous counterpart. Epidemiologfcal studies in humans show linear dose- response curves in all but two investigations. The difference from the strongly nonlinear slopes ·seen in animal studies could be due to the heterogeneity of the human population: if the individual sensitivity to a carcinogen is governed by a large number of genetic and Iife-style factors, the non-linea. rities will tend to cancel each other out and the dose- response curve becomes 'quasi-linear'...|$|R
40|$|During {{chemical}} carcinogenesis in the liver, {{a population of}} abnormal cells in lesions referred to as altered foci precedes the appearance of neoplasms. Most altered foci do not develop further, but a small fraction progress to formation of neoplasms. Liver tumor promoters increase the fraction that progress. The mechanisms for this action of promoters may involve {{an effect on the}} cell membrane. Cells in vivo and in vitro exchange molecules through specialized membrane organelles known as gap junctions. Intercellular transfer of growth and/or differentiation regulating factors could be involved in suppressing the growth of initiated cells in the altered foci. Several liver tumor promoters have been found to inhibit intercellular communication in an in vitro liver culture system. This effect on the cell membrane could, thus, be the basis for the release of cells in foci for further growth into neoplasms. Such an epigenetic action would account for the requirement for high doses and prolonged exposure for certain liver tumor promoters. In addition, it implies a distinct type of health risk analysis for chemicals of this type. Several chemicals, particularly halogenated hydrocarbons, produce primarily or exclusively an increase in liver tumors in rodent strains that are characterized by a substantial background incidence of such tumors. These chemicals have not been demonstrated to have the DNA damaging capability of genotoxic carcinogens and several enhance the hepatocarcinogenicity of previously administered liver carcinogens. Moreover, they exert an inhibition of intercellular communication. Thus, carcinogens of this type may be <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> functioning as liver tumor promoters. Accordingly, the health risk analysis for these chemicals is different from that for genotoxic carcinogens...|$|R
40|$|The Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) cell-transformation assay {{represents}} a short-term {{in vitro assay}} capable of predicting rodent carcinogenicity of chemicals {{with a high degree}} of concordance (LeBoeuf et al [1996]. Mutat Res 356 : 85 – 127). The SHE assay models the earliest identi able stage in carcinogenicity, morphological cell transformation. In contrast to other short-term in vitro assays, both genotoxic and <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> are detected. The SHE assay, originally developed by Berwald and Sachs (J Natl Cancer Inst 35 : 641 – 661) and modi ed as described by LeBoeuf and Kerckaert (Carcinogenesis 7 : 1431 – 1440), was included in the International Life Sciences Institute, Health and Environmental Sciences Institute (ILSI/HESI). Alternative Carcinogenicity Testing (ACT) collaboration to provide additional information on the use of short-term in vitro tests in predicting carcinogenic potential. A total of 19 ILSI compounds have been tested in the SHE assay: 15 were tested for this project, whereas clo brate, methapyrilene, reserpine, and Di(2 -ethylhexyl) phalate (DEHP) were tested previously. Of the 3 noncarcinogenic compounds tested, 2 were negative in the SHE assay, whereas ampicillin was tested positive. The remaining 16 compounds tested were either known rodent carcinogens and/or human carcinogens. From this group, 15 tested positive in the SHE assay whereas phenacetin, a genotoxic carcinogen, was tested negative. Therefore, overall concordance between the SHE assay and rodent bioassay was 89 % (17 / 19), whereas concordance with known or predicted human carcinogens was 37 % (7 / 19). Based on these data, it is concluded that the SHE cell-transformation assay has utility for predicting the results of the rodent carcinogenesis bioassay but lacks the selectivity to distinguish between rodent and human carcinogens...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Industrial Physiology)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2002. In {{this study}} an {{investigation}} {{has been done}} to determine: 1. The exposure of the workers to coke dust. 2. The size of the particles in the measured coke dust. 3. The existence of BaP in the various types of coke. 4. The health status of the workers by analyzing the lung function tests and also the liver enzyme concentrations. Personal sampling was done on workers at the coke plant. Sampling was done on cleaners, silo workers, workers at the kiln, a process controller and a foreman. Static samples were done in the offices, The particle size was analyzed on some of the personal samples. The presence of BaP was measured in coke. The respiratory data of 15 workers were sampled to determine any deviation on the lung functions. This was also done on liver enzymes. Statistical analyses was done on the health data. Workers at the coke plant are exposed to respiratory coke dust. More than 80 % of coke dust at the Carbo-Tar plant is respiratable according to the results of this study. BaP is found in the respiratable fraction of coke dust at the coke plant. The workers are subjected to BaP - that is a sign of the presence of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's). PAH's are classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The concentration, to which the workers are subjected, is much lower than the international threshold limit value for BaP (table 4. 1. 3). Literature shows that a variety of illnesses and cancers (cancer of the stomach, cancer of the lungs, respiratory deviations, skin cancer and dermatitis, effects on the immune system etc.) are found in coke oven workers as a result of being exposed to PAWS (Bhopal et al., 1994; Jongeneelen, 1992; Redmond et al., 1976; Doll et al., 1972; Lloyd, 1971 & Doll er al., 1965). In this study however, no diagnosis is made about possible lung illnesses in group content, but there is an indication of early obstructive lung disease, because of the exposure to respiratabie coke dust. Some individuals show obstructive lung disease because of the possible exposure to high concentrations of coke dust. The liver enzymes (ALT and AST) show no sign of any deviations in the group content, although some individuals do show deviations of the ALT enzymes. The reason for this is unclear 'because the concentration of BaP in coke dust is lower than the threshold value determined by the Swedish. There is a possible cancer risk to the workers because of the exposure to PAH's. However, the exposure of the workers to BaP is very low. Literature shows that workers who are subjected to tobacco smoke, have a 20 % higher risk to contract cancer (Xu et al., 1996). No health effects could be detected for the workers because of the exposure to PAH's. The plant has only been in production for 6 years, and the studies done by other researchers were on data of retired coke oven workers who had at least 25 years and more work experience at coke plants. The possibility that some of the workers could develop cancer can't be excluded. The situation must be monitored and a recommendation is made that this study must be repeated in 4 year's time. Further research is necessary to determine the genoroxicity of coke dust. The exposure to gemtoxicity carcinogens must be zero while there is an acceptance for exposure to <b>epigenetic</b> <b>carcinogens</b> (Williams & Burson, 1985). Master...|$|R
40|$|Gap {{junctions}} mediate {{intercellular communication}} through channels composed of proteins termed connexins (Cxs). We {{have shown that}} Cx 32 is downregulated in the liver of female rats exposed to hexachlorobenzene (HCB), an <b>epigenetic</b> environmental <b>carcinogen.</b> This is concomi-tant with the activation of the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) pathway, leading to the activation and nuclear transloca-tion of Akt and the inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase- 3 b (GSK 3 b). E-cadherin, an adhering junction protein, is also downregulated in the liver of these female rats, owing to the inactivation of GSK 3 b. Using an in vitro model, {{the aim of this}} study was to determine the role of the ILK pathway in the regulation of Cx 32. In order to mimic the activation of the ILK pathway, a well-differentiated rat hepatoma cell line, MH 1 C 1, was transiently transfected with an expression vector for ILK (ILK+ cells). ILK+ cells displayed significantly lower Cx 32 mRNA levels and Akt was also activated and translocated into the nucleus. Using a constitutively active Akt expression vec-tor, we showed that Akt transfected cells had lower Cx 32 mRNA levels, indicating a role for Akt in Cx 32 regulation. Finally, using an Akt-NES vector, a nuclear-active form of Akt, we showed that Cx 32 protein levels were reduced in transfected cells as compared with cell transfected with the wild-type inactive Akt vector, suggesting that the nuclear form of Akt is responsible for the downregulation of Cx 32. Overall, these data indicate that Cx 32 is downregulated by the ILK pathway activation in rat hepatocytes and that this is mediated via the activation and nuclear translocation of Akt...|$|R
40|$|Health risk {{analysis}} needs to apply newer {{developments in the}} understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the carcinogenic process which has allowed for the classification of chemical carcinogens into those that damage genetic material directly (genotoxic carcinogens) and those that operate by indirect or epigenetic mechanisms. We propose a systematic decision point approach for detecting and evaluating substances for carcinogenic risk. This approach recognizes that genotoxic and epigenetic agents operate by different mechanisms and distinguishes between these two categories of carcinogens primarily on the basis of results in a battery of short-term tests that includes systems which reliably detect genotoxic carcinogens and others which may respond to <b>epigenetic</b> agents. Genotoxic <b>carcinogens</b> at very low dosages may have practical, effective threshold no-effect levels, but, nevertheless, because of their mechanism of action they are regarded as a qualitative hazard.
