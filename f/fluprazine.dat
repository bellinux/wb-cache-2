50|$|<b>Fluprazine</b> (DU-27,716) {{is a drug}} of the phenylpiperazine class. It is a {{so-called}} serenic or antiaggressive agent. It {{is closely related to}} several other piperazines, including eltoprazine and batoprazine, and TFMPP, as well as more distantly to the azapirones such as buspirone. The pharmacology of <b>fluprazine</b> is unknown, but it is likely to act as an agonist at the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors like its sister compound eltoprazine.|$|E
50|$|Batoprazine {{is a drug}} of the phenylpiperazine class {{which has}} been {{described}} as a serenic or antiaggressive agent. It acts as a 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor agonist. It is closely related to eltoprazine, <b>fluprazine,</b> and naphthylpiperazine, of which possess similar actions and effects.|$|E
50|$|Eltoprazine (DU-28,853) {{is a drug}} of the phenylpiperazine class {{which is}} a serenic or antiaggressive agent. It acts as an agonist at the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors and as an {{antagonist}} at the 5-HT2C receptor. It {{is closely related to}} <b>fluprazine</b> and batoprazine, which are similarly acting drugs.|$|E
50|$|The {{recreational}} drug MDMA ("ecstasy") {{and a variety}} of related drugs have been described as empathogen-entactogens, or simply as entactogens. These agents possess serenic and empathy-increasing properties in addition to their euphoriant effects, and have been associated with increased sociability, friendliness, and feelings of closeness to others as well as emotional empathy and prosocial behavior. The entactogenic effects of these drugs are thought to be related to their ability to temporarily increase the levels of certain brain chemicals, including serotonin, dopamine, and, particularly, oxytocin. Certain other serotonergic drugs, such as 5-HT1A receptor agonists, also increase oxytocin levels and may possess serenic properties as well. The phenylpiperazine mixed 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptor agonists eltoprazine, <b>fluprazine,</b> and batoprazine have been described based on animal research as serenics.|$|E
