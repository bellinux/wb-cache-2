Based on data on <b>exportable</b> <b>production</b> at the municipal level in 1892, coffee production in 1925 and of public land allocation and land conflicts during the nineteenth and twentieth century, we found that the greatest obstacle that faced Colombian export development was the weakness of settlers´ property rights in the frontier lands. The quantitative results show that in the absence of land conflicts, the municipality´s <b>exportable</b> <b>production</b> would have been at least twice as muchas that observed.

40|$|As {{a country}} {{progressively}} engages in international trade, its {{factors of production}} will enter increasingly into the export sector, where their return is higher, compared to the import competing sector. At the regional level too those states, which can attune their production structure to international demands, earn higher than other states and grow at a faster rate. Further if the newly-industrial states concentrate more on those sectors, a trend of regional convergence will be discernible. Then, the regional openness index, developed by Marjit, Kar and Maiti (2007), has been reconstructed by using two alternative weighting techniques to combine the export and import intensities, ranks of correlation of state production shares, respectively with national export and import shares of the states. The per capita net state domestic products have grown in all major states in India during 1980 - 2004 but at different rates resulting {{to the rise of}} regional disparity and the regional openness have been detrimental for this. The state, which moved away from importable production to <b>exportable</b> <b>production,</b> grew faster than the rate of others at least by 1 - 1. 5 % per annum. Definitely, a few newly-industrial states showed an increasing dependence on <b>exportable</b> <b>production,</b> but not all. Moreover, some of the industrially developed states (in terms of exportable share) it has been observed yet continue with importable production to a large extent.

40|$|This paper uses a Heckscher-Ohlin nugget {{framework}} {{with both}} traded and non-traded goods. Our motive is {{to investigate the}} effects of corruption and tax cut. We assume only the non-traded sector to be corruption affected. We argue that a fall {{in the degree of}} corruption surprisingly increases number of intermediators while tax change has no effect on it. But the size of the intermediation activities expands in both the cases. Low corruption diminishes the <b>exportable</b> <b>production</b> and raises importable production while a tax cut does not have any effect. The welfare implication is ambiguous in case of a decrease in cost of corruption. A tax cut, however, raises the welfare unambiguously. ...|$|E

New, i. e. <b>exportable,</b> primary <b>production</b> in the upper water-column was estimated in two ways; by nutrient deficit measurements, and by primary production rate measurements using separate 14 C-labelled radioisotope and 15 N-labelled stable isotope uptake incubations. The resulting average annual <b>exportable</b> primary <b>production</b> estimates at the time-series site from nutrient deficit and primary production rates were 13 and 16 mol C m− 2 respectively.

40|$|Domestic {{inflation}} {{tends to}} crowd out {{the effectiveness of}} devaluation mainly due to the increased import costs. But, if the inflation is driven by external oil price shocks, it has an ambiguity on the same. This {{would depend on the}} relative influence of oil price on the domestic and foreign price of the major trading partners. The current paper would like to empirically investigate the effect of oil price on the exchange rate movement and the resultant trade balance for the case of Fiji. The issue of oil price has been, so far, ignored in such analysis undertaken in Fiji, because of negligible export share of manufacturing activities of the country. Since oil price could influence the domestic price through the increased transport and other costs, it can still negate the effect of devaluation. We find that the domestic inflation has been influenced by the oil price shocks from early 2000 and this has partially limited the potential benefits of the recent devaluation. As a result,the transformation process from importable to <b>exportable</b> <b>production</b> has been weak and working against the objective of devaluation in Fiji in recent years. This further contributes to the inflationary process of the economy and puts the economy into a dilemma of choosing between devaluation and the fight against it...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of real {{exchange}} rate fluctuations on sectoral and regional employment in China from 1980 to 2008. In contrast to theoretical predictions, employment in both the tradable and non-tradable sectors contracts following a real appreciation. Our results are robust across different sub-samples, levels of sectoral disaggregation, and are more pronounced for regions with higher export exposure. We attribute our findings to the importance of services as intermediate input in <b>exportable</b> <b>production.</b> We test this channel of exchange rate transmission using regional input-output tables linked with employment data at the region-sector level. The results of this paper have important implications for China''s labor market adjustment should the Chinese RMB strengthen in the future. To mitigate the costs of short-run labor market adjustment, appropriate demand management and structural reforms in the non-traded sectors should play an important role.

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{production}} of manufactures and extraction increases. The possible {{reason may be}} that Pakistan’s non-participation in CPTPP may lead to decrease in sectorial imports. This would lead to increase in reliance on domestic production, thereby encouraging the production of import substitute sectors. Simulation II shows a positive and modest of textile (12.4 %) and wearing apparel (7.5 %), respectively. This indicates that CPTPP may encourage exports of these sectors, thereby leading to increase in the production of these top <b>exportable</b> commodities. <b>Production</b> of leather, light manufactures and ‘meat and livestock’ may decrease if Pakistan becomes a part of the CPTPP. Possible {{reason may be that}} Pakistan’s entry to CPTPP may lead to increase in imports of these commodities, which may in turn discourage domestic production of import substitutes as these commodities are included in the list of Pakistan’s top imports.

40|$|The {{effect of}} chronic hypoxia upon the rat parotid gland is studied by {{electron}} microscopy and biochemistry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats {{are subjected to}} 88 % N 1 and 12 % 02 at less than 2 psi pressure for 7 days. For electron microscopy, the tissues are perfusion-fixed, embedded and sectioned in a routine manner. In the biochemical studies, rats are injected with ‘H-phenylalanine (2 &i/g; s. i. + 5 Ci/mM) 60 min before sacrifice. Fresh glands are then prepared for analysis of amylase (Cibachrome-amylase substrate method), DNA (diphenylamine reaction), and total protein (Lowry method). The radioactivity in the acid precipitable and soluble fractions is determined by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The control animals are pair-fed and handled identically except that they are maintained in an ambient atmosphere. The ultrastructure of the hypoxic cells is altered in several areas. The Golgi apparatus demonstrates a decrease in organization and contains fewer transport vesicles. The rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum is broken and presents many vesicular and concentric profiles. The mitochondria have undergone several changes including swelling, clumping of intramitochondrial matrix, and fragmentation of cristase. The nucleus demonstrates a fibrillar pattern and contains a reduced amount of heterochromatin. The biochemical results indicate that, com-pared with controls, the hypoxic cells contain only 55 % of amylase and 84 % of the DNA, and thus suggest a drastic reduction of <b>exportable</b> protein <b>production</b> {{and an increase in}} cellular size, respectively. On the contrary, the incorporation of “H-phenylalanine demonstrates an increase in the amount of radioactivity in the acid precipitable fraction of the hypoxic cells. These results lead to the conclusion that hypoxic stress causes a suppression of exportable protein synthesis, but may induce other cytoplasmic protein production, reflecting the biochemical and morpho-logic adjustment of the cell to a recovery phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the potential causes of low oxygen levels in the bottom water of the Oyster Grounds region of the shallow southern North Sea, an area which provides suitable conditions for low oxygen levels to develop. At {{the end of the summer}} stratified period, relevant biogeochemical processes were investigated using a combination of sedimentary and water column rate measurements. Phytoplankton nitrate and ammonium uptake was measured throughout the water column using 15 N labelled isotopes and showed ammonium uptake dominated in the upper and bottom mixed layer with a maximum 294. 4 µmol N m- 3 h- 1. In the deep chlorophyll maximum at the thermocline, primary production was dominated by nitrate uptake, with an average of 35. 0 µmol N m- 3 h- 1, relative to ammonium uptake, with an average of 24. 6 µmol N m- 3 h- 1. This high relative nitrate uptake will in part result in <b>exportable</b> new <b>production</b> to the isolated bottom mixed layer and sediments, as opposed to regenerated ammonium driven uptake. This biomass export was indicated by significant benthic oxygen consumption rates in the stratified region (782 - 1275 µmol O 2 m- 2 h- 1 µmol N m- 3 h- 1) long after the end of the spring bloom. The sediments were also an active net source of nitrate, ammonium, phosphate and silicate into the bottom mixed layer of 4. 4, 8. 4, 2. 3 and 68. 8 µmol m- 2 h- 1, respectively. The export of new production within the thermocline to the bottom mixed layer and the consequent sediment oxygen consumption in the isolated bottom mixed layer in the Oyster Grounds are expected to have contributed to the low bottom water oxygen concentrations of 2. 07 mg l- 1 (64. 7 µmol l- 1) measured. The long stratified period associated with this low oxygen is predicted to occur more regularly in the future and continued monitoring of this ecologically important region is therefore essential if the causes of these potentially damaging low oxygen levels are to be fully understood...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough the Southern Ocean is {{considered}} a high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll (HNLC) area, massive and recurrent blooms are observed over and downstream of the Kerguelen Plateau. This mosaic of blooms is triggered by a higher iron supply resulting from {{the interaction between the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current and the local bathymetry. Net primary production, N uptake (NO - 3 and NH + 4), and nitrification rates were measured at eight stations in austral spring 2011 (October–November) during the KEOPS 2 cruise in the Kerguelen Plateau area. Natural iron fertilization stimulated primary production, with mixed layer integrated net primary production and growth rates much higher in the fertilized areas (up to 315 mmol C m − 2 d − 1 and up to 0. 31 d − 1 respectively) compared to the HNLC reference site (12 mmol C m − 2 d − 1 and 0. 06 d − 1 respectively). Primary production was mainly sustained by nitrate uptake, with f ratios (corresponding to NO - 3 -uptake / (NO - 3 -uptake + NH + 4 -uptake)) lying at {{the upper end of the}} observations for the Southern Ocean (up to 0. 9). We report high rates of nitrification (up to ∼ 3 µmol N L − 1 d − 1, with ∼ 90 % of them − 1 d − 1) typically occurring below the euphotic zone, as classically observed in the global ocean. The specificity of the studied area is that at most of the stations, the euphotic layer was shallower than the mixed layer, implying that nitrifiers can efficiently compete with phytoplankton for the ammonium produced by remineralization at low-light intensities. Nitrate produced by nitrification in the mixed layer below the euphotic zone is easily supplied to the euphotic zone waters above, and nitrification sustained 70 ± 30 % of the nitrate uptake in the productive area above the Kerguelen Plateau. This complicates estimations of new production as potentially <b>exportable</b> <b>production.</b> We conclude that high productivity in deep mixing system stimulates the N cycle by increasing both assimilation and regeneration...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of the}} Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP), a {{fast reactor}} {{simulation}} program was launched in April 2007 to develop a suite of modern simulation tools specifically for the analysis and design of sodium cooled fast reactors. The general goal of the new suite of codes {{is to reduce the}} uncertainties and biases in the various areas of reactor design activities by enhanced prediction capabilities. Under this fast reactor simulation program, a high-fidelity deterministic neutron transport code named UNIC is being developed. The final objective is to produce an integrated, advanced neutronics code that allows the high fidelity description of a nuclear reactor and simplifies the multi-step design process by direct coupling with thermal-hydraulics and structural mechanics calculations. Currently there are three solvers for the neutron transport code incorporated in UNIC: PN 2 ND, SN 2 ND, and MOCFE. PN 2 ND is based on a second-order even-parity spherical harmonics discretization of the transport equation and its primary target area of use is the existing homogenization approaches that are prevalent in reactor physics. MOCFE is based upon the method of characteristics applied to an unstructured finite element mesh and its primary target area of use is the fine grained nature of the explicit geometrical problems which is the long term goal of this project. SN 2 ND is based on a second-order, even-parity discrete ordinates discretization of the transport equation and its primary target area is the modeling transition region between the PN 2 ND and MOCFE solvers. The major development goal in fiscal year 2008 for the MOCFE solver was to include a two-dimensional capability that is scalable to hundreds of processors. The short term goal of this solver is to solve two-dimensional representations of reactor systems such that the energy and spatial self-shielding are accounted for and reliable cross sections can be generated for the homogeneous calculations. In this report we present good results for an OECD benchmark obtained using the new two-dimensional capability of the MOCFE solver. Additional work on the MOCFE solver is focused on studying the current parallelization algorithms that can be applied to both the two- and three-dimensional implementations such that they are scalable to thousands of processors. The initial research into this topic indicates that, as expected, the current parallelization scheme is not sufficiently scalable for the detailed reactor geometry that it is intended for. As a consequence, we are starting the investigative research to determine the alternatives that are applicable for massively parallel machines. The major development goal in fiscal year 2008 for the PN 2 ND and SN 2 ND solvers was to introduce parallelism by angle and energy. The motivation for this is two-fold: (1) reduce the memory burden by picking a simpler preconditioner with reduced matrix storage and (2) improve parallel performance by solving the angular subsystems of the within group equation simultaneously. The solver development in FY 2007 focused on using PETSc to solve the within group equation where only spatial parallelization was utilized. Because most homogeneous problems required relatively few spatial degrees of freedom (tens of thousands) the only way to improve the parallelism was to spread the angular moment subsystems across the parallel system. While the coding has been put into place for parallelization by space, angle, and group, we have not optimized any of the solvers and therefore do not give an assessment of the achievement of this work in this report. The immediate task to be completed is to implement and validate Tchebychev acceleration of the fission source iteration algorithm (inverse power method in this work) and optimize both the PN 2 ND and SN 2 ND solvers. We further intend to extend the applicability of the UNIC code by adding a first-order discrete ordinates solver termed SN 1 ST. Upon completion of this work, all memory usage problems are to be identified and studied in the solvers with the intent of making the new version of an <b>exportable</b> <b>production</b> code in either FY 2008 or FY 2009. This report covers the status of these tasks and discusses the work yet to be completed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAgriculture is an {{important}} source of income for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq (ISIS), which currently rules over large parts of the breadbaskets of the two countries. It has received limited attention compared to other sources of ISIS revenues such as oil, looting, ransom, foreign donations and various forms of taxation. We estimate winter crops production of wheat and barley in ISIS-controlled areas in both Syria and Iraq for the years 2014 – 2015 and irrigated summer crops production (cotton) in Northeast Syria. We show that remote sensing can give a credible estimation of agricultural production in the absence of statistics. With evidence from MODIS Aqua and Terra Satellites as well as Landsat imagery, we find that agricultural production in ISIS-controlled Syrian and Iraqi zones has been sustained in 2014 and 2015, despite the detrimental impact of conflict. After a drought in 2014 production was able to capitalize on improved rainfalls in 2015. First indications show that the winter grain harvest of 2016 in Iraqi territories of ISIS was significantly above pre-conflict mean and below pre-conflict mean in its Syrian territories. We also show how water flows along the Euphrates have impacted production. We estimate the revenue that ISIS can derive from wheat and barley production and the likely magnitude of an <b>exportable</b> surplus. Agricultural <b>production</b> gives the group a degree of resilience, although its economy is not sustainable in the longer run and could be affected by military collapse. Taxation of recurrent income streams such as agriculture will become more important for ISIS as its extractive sources of revenues show signs of dwindling. Beside non-grain food imports, agricultural production is crucial for its political legitimacy by ensuring food provision to the broader population. Food security considerations would require a high priority in any post-ISIS reconstruction effort and would need to include the rehabilitation of supply chains for agricultural inputs such as quality seeds and fertilizers...|$|R
