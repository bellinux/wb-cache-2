5000|$|The {{signal ground}} {{is a common}} return for the other connections; it appears on two pins in the Yost {{standard}} but is the same signal. The DB-25 connector includes a second [...] "protective ground" [...] on pin 1, which {{is intended to be}} connected by each device to its own <b>frame</b> <b>ground</b> or similar. Connecting this to pin 7 (signal reference ground) is a common practice but not recommended.|$|E
5000|$|The {{signals are}} named from the {{standpoint}} of the DTE. The ground pin is a common return for the other connections, and establishes the [...] "zero" [...] voltage to which voltages on the other pins are referenced. The DB-25 connector includes a second [...] "protective ground" [...] on pin 1; this is connected internally to equipment <b>frame</b> <b>ground,</b> and should not be connected in the cable or connector to signal ground.|$|E
50|$|Roberts Inn, is a {{historic}} home and farm located at Cooksville, Howard County, Maryland. The complex consists of a -story stuccoed stone house with a reconstructed log wing built about 1808, and several 19th- to early-20th-century agricultural outbuildings, including a frame bank barn, a <b>frame</b> <b>ground</b> barn, a tile dairy, and a frame silo. The construction of the house coincided with {{the extension of the}} National Pike through the Cooksville area. Documentary and architectural evidence supports its use as a turnpike tavern from an early date. Tradition holds that Marquis de Lafayette breakfasted at Roberts Inn during his 1824 tour of America.|$|E
50|$|From {{abolition}} of the signal box on 8 May 1981, the level crossing there was converted to user operation, and two <b>ground</b> <b>frames</b> were provided at Coombe; No 1 <b>ground</b> <b>frame</b> controlling the junction points, and No 2 <b>ground</b> <b>frame</b> {{at the north end}} of passenger operation, controlling trap points from Moorswater.|$|R
50|$|A <b>ground</b> <b>frame</b> {{is a small}} lever frame located {{beside a}} railway, usually at ground level. A <b>ground</b> <b>frame</b> does not {{normally}} require any form of shelter since it is usually operated by traincrew and not permanently staffed. A <b>ground</b> <b>frame</b> is typically used to control the points giving access to an infrequently used siding or an emergency crossover, where the expense of providing control from a remote signal box cannot be justified. In some situations, signals may be worked from a <b>ground</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{signal box}} was {{situated}} {{on the west side}} of the line near the junction, but since 1981 the points have been worked by the guard of the train using two <b>ground</b> <b>frames</b> on the east side of the line, No. 1 <b>Ground</b> <b>Frame</b> at the junction south of the station, and No. 2 <b>Ground</b> <b>Frame</b> just north of the platform.|$|R
50|$|At first sight, the Multi Interface Shoe {{resembles a}} {{standard}} ISO 518 hotshoe with middle contact and <b>frame</b> <b>ground</b> {{and without any}} vendor-specific extra contacts, but additional electrical contacts are hidden under {{the front of the}} hotshoe. Therefore, the hotshoe is mechanically compatible with any ISO 518-based equipment, and while it does not allow to control third-party flashes, ISO-based flashes can be triggered at least. The hotshoe also features three holes in its metal base in order to support an optional locking mechanism in the flash or other hotshoe device. It does not, however, provide an auto-locking mechanism as on the Auto-lock Accessory Shoe.|$|E
5000|$|The {{multi-part}} {{house was}} built by captain Benjamin Warfield starting after 1766 after acquiring a 550-acre land grant from Henry Griffith named [...] "Fredricksburg". The complex includes a ca. 1798 log ground barn, an 1860-1890 frame wagon shed with corn crib, an early-20th century frame water tower, <b>frame</b> <b>ground</b> barn with cantilevered forebay, frame shed, frame dairy barn, concrete silo, concrete block dairy, and several frame shelter sheds. The buildings are located on a generally flat site surrounded by gently rolling terrain and are set well back from the road along a gravel drive that winds {{through the center of}} the farm. The J.P Tarenz log house was a log slave quarters built around 1768 that was relocated offsite after the civil war to accommodate freed slaves. The remains of Maryland's 45th Governor Edwin Warfield (1848-1920), are buried onsite in the family cemetery.|$|E

40|$|Illumination {{correction}} or Color Constancy (CC) is {{the ability}} of humans for resolving the apparent colors of objects in a given scene independently of the illumination source. For robust skin detection in images/videos, we evaluate and investigate the effect of CC approaches on static skin segmentation approaches. The effect of five CC approaches namely Gray-Edge CC, Gray-World CC, max-RGB CC, Shades-of-Gray CC and Bayesian CC is studied for the YCbCr static skin filter. Results on two datasets (DS 1 and DS 2) having annotated per <b>frame</b> <b>ground</b> truth show that skin classification performance is improved. At the same time, the sift and deviation of the skin locus in the chromaticity space will result in alternating performance...|$|E
40|$|Scope of this beachelor’s {{thesis is}} a design of {{load-bearing}} steel construction for {{the roof of}} local swimming pool {{in the town of}} Blansko. This construction is designed in the way of replacement of current steel construction {{which is part of the}} whole building. The basic load bearing system of the building is a concrete prefabricated <b>frame.</b> <b>Ground</b> dimensions of this building are 37. 4 m x 55. 4 m with a height from the ground plane to the top of the newly designed rooftop 13. 14 m. Ground dimensions of the separate construction of roof are 20. 8 m x 30. 4 m with construction height 8. 675 m in southern facade and 5. 075 m in other facades. Load-bering construction is architectural and that’s why is formed mainly from hollow sections like RHS,SHS a CHS. Because of a high humidity all the joints are welded.

40|$|The TOPEX/Poseidon Project Satellite Performance Analysis Team's (SPAT) {{roles and}} {{responsibilities}} have grown to include functions that are typically performed by other teams on JPL Flight Projects. In particular, SPAT Telecommunication's role has expanded beyond the nominal function of monitoring, assessing, characterizing, and trending the spacecraft (S/C) RF/Telecom subsystem to one of End-to-End Information Systems (EEIS) monitoring. This has been accomplished {{by taking advantage of}} the spacecraft and ground data system structures and protocols. By processing both the received spacecraft telemetry minor <b>frame</b> <b>ground</b> generated CRC flags and NASCOM block poly error flags, bit error rates (BER) for each link segment can be determined. This provides the capability to characterize the separate link segments, determine science data recovery, and perform fault/anomaly detection and isolation. By monitoring and managing the links, TOPEX has successfully recovered approximately 99. 9 percent of the science data with an integrity (BER) of better than 1 x 10 (exp 8). This paper presents the algorithms used to process the above flags and the techniques used for EEIS monitoring...|$|E

Polyester has been the main material for manufacturing artificial flowers since the 1970s. Most artificial flowers in the market nowadays are made of polyester fabric.|$|R
50|$|The Moorswater section has a fixed 'stop board' {{protecting}} the station. Similarly, the Looe section has a 'stop board' before the points at Coombe Junction. There is no 'stop board' on the Liskeard section because the points must be locked {{in position to}} allow access to the <b>ground</b> <b>frame's</b> station limits otherwise the Looe branch staff cannot {{be removed from the}} <b>ground</b> <b>frame.</b> The stop boards are fixed signals and a train may not be driven past without authority from the guard operating the <b>ground</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|R

50|$|If it was {{necessary}} for the train to be on the sidings controlled by the <b>ground</b> <b>frame</b> for a considerable time, it was desirable to release the running line so other trains could travel through the block section. To achieve this, a token instrument would be provided in a lineside hut near the <b>ground</b> <b>frame.</b> Once the train was off the main line, the points would be set back to normal, allowing the token to be removed from the <b>ground</b> <b>frame.</b> It would be then inserted into the token instrument in the hut, releasing the instruments {{at both ends of the}} section, so either signal box could then remove a token for another train to use the line, whilst the shunting train was in the sidings.|$|R
