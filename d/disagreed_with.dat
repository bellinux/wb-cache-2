5|$|After {{some months}} of {{lobbying}} and discussion, Harvard's ruling body, the Harvard Corporation, announced on May 8, 1933, {{that it had}} elected Conant as the next President of Harvard. Alfred North Whitehead, Harvard's eminent professor of philosophy <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> the decision, declaring: Clark was very much responsible for Conant's election.|$|E
5|$|As {{a popular}} physician, Sonnabend was renowned for {{protecting}} and promoting patients' rights. He did not {{shy away from}} criticising the scientific establishment when {{he felt it was}} failing to put patients' interests first. He often <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> mainstream opinion on AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Formally {{backing the}} festival's trans-exclusion policy led to protests and boycotts aimed towards Mr. Lady acts, Wilson and The Butchies in particular. Groups such as Camp Trans, and many {{participants}} in the queercore community <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Lady's stance and felt that the group and label exploited transgender images.

5|$|In 1886 Georg Brandes {{compared}} Either/Or with Frederik Paludan-Müller's Kalanus in Eminent Authors of the Nineteenth Century, {{which was}} translated into English at that time. Later, in 1906, he compared Kierkegaard's Diary of the Seducer with Rousseau's Julie, or the New Heloise and with Goethe's Sorrows of Young Werther. He also compared Either/Or to Henrik Ibsen's Brand but Edmund Gosse <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> him.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Euler made {{important}} contributions in optics. He <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> Newton's corpuscular theory {{of light in}} the Opticks, which was then the prevailing theory. His 1740s papers on optics helped ensure that the wave theory of light proposed by Christiaan Huygens would become the dominant mode of thought, at least until the development of the quantum theory of light.|$|E
5|$|In his history, Harry Altham {{wrote that}} the 1884 Australians have been equated with the 1882 team but he himself <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> that assessment.

5|$|The four justices who <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> the {{majority}} filed three separate dissenting opinions. All of the dissenting justices supported the Afroyim v.

5|$|The second {{school of}} Vedanta is the Vishishtadvaita, {{which was founded}} by Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE). Ramanuja <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> Adi Shankara and the Advaita school. Visistadvaita is a {{synthetic}} philosophy bridging the monistic Advaita and theistic Dvaita systems of Vedanta. Ramanuja frequently cited the Upanishads, and stated that Vishishtadvaita {{is grounded in the}} Upanishads.|$|E

5|$|When {{it came to}} politics, Vogt was a {{conservative}} with many liberal opinions. He <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> Francis Hagerup, who supported the Union between Sweden and Norway.

5|$|Additionally, {{the company}} sells beer at the Whopper Bar locations, {{including}} Budweiser, Bud Light, and Miller Lite in aluminum bottles designed to maintain temperature. The move, designed {{to target the}} important 30-and-under demographic, has been called risky by industry analysts because the company {{is known as a}} fast food purveyor and not as an alcoholic beverages seller. Other industry consultants have <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> the assessment, believing that the move is timely because the company is growing with its aging customer base.|$|E
5000|$|Jane Bone's Skunk Stuff {{describes}} {{a diet of}} vegetables, fruits, dairy, yogurt, vitamins and minerals, fiber, carbohydrates, and eggs.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{technique}} for melanocytic lesion segmentation, based on mono-dimensional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in colour space. Our technique {{is simple and}} extremely fast, segmenting high-resolution images in {{a fraction of a}} second even with the modest computational resources available on a cell phone – an improvement of an order of magnitude or more over state-of-the-art techniques. Our technique is also extremely accurate: very experienced dermatologists <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> its segmentations less than they <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the segmentations of all state-of-the-art techniques we tested, and in fact less than they <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> the segmentations of dermatologists of moderate experience...|$|R

5|$|Although Robert {{condemned}} Gilbert Porrée {{in conjunction}} with Peter Lombard, he {{did not agree with}} Lombard's Christology, or views on the nature of Jesus Christ. Likewise, although he <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> some of Abelard's teachings, he defended Abelard against charges of heresy. Robert did, however, agree with some of Abelard's teachings and methods. The introduction to the Sententiae proclaims Robert's desire to harmonise the writings of two unnamed scholars, who have been identified by modern writers as Hugh of St Victor and Abelard.|$|E
5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> the Hornbostel-Sachs system and {{developed}} his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones {{on the basis of}} sound production, but membranophones {{on the basis of the}} shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.|$|E
5|$|As 91 {{votes are}} needed to elect the Governor from the 180-member body and Democrats and Progressives held 112 seats, it was {{considered}} unlikely that Milne would win. Milne argued that legislators should decide the election in line with how their individual districts voted. Neal Goswami of the Vermont Press Bureau calculated that if each legislator voted according to the results in their district, the vote {{would result in a}} 90–90 tie. Milne <b>disagreed</b> <b>with</b> this calculation and claimed voting according to district outcome would result in his winning 93–87.|$|E
