40|$|Abstract. The {{ability to}} make {{meaningful}} comparisons between side-channel <b>distinguishers</b> is important both to attackers seeking an optimal strategy and to designers wishing to secure a device against the strongest possible threat. The usual experimental approach requires the distinguishing vectors to be estimated: outcomes do not fully represent the inherent theoretic capabilities of <b>distinguishers</b> and do not {{provide a basis for}} conclusive, like-for-like comparisons. This is particularly problematic in the case of mutual information-based side channel analysis (MIA) which is notoriously sensitive to the choice of estimator. We propose an evaluation framework which captures those theoretic characteristics of attack <b>distinguishers</b> having the strongest bearing on an attacker’s general ability to estimate with practical success, thus enabling like-for-like comparisons between different <b>distinguishers</b> in various leakage scenarios. We apply our framework to an evaluation of MIA relative to its rather more well-established correlationbased predecessor and a proposed variant inspired by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. Our analysis makes sense of the rift between the a priori reasoning in favour of MIA and the disappointing empirical findings of previous comparative studies, and moreover reveals several unprecedented features of the attack <b>distinguishers</b> in terms of their sensitivity to noise. It also explores—to our knowledge, for the first time—theoretic properties of near-generic power models previously proposed (and experimentally verified) for use in attacks targeting injective functions. ...|$|R

By the Lemma, we can choose either B or C as the <b>distinguisher,</b> let's say B. Then the states of D and E are split by their transitions into B. But F, which doesn't point into B, simply doesn't split during the current iteration of the algorithm; it will be refined by other distinguisher(s).|$|E
