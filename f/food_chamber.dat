40|$|The mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus (Me 5), which {{receives}} {{input from}} oral proprioceptors and projects to higher brain regions, {{is involved in}} mastication-induced modulation of satiation. To investigate how the Me 5 {{is involved in the}} control of feeding and exploratory behavior, we examined the effect of bilateral electrolytic lesions of the Me 5 on feeding and exploratory behavior in mice. Mouse feeding and exploratory behaviors were analyzed using a food- search-compulsion-apparatus (FSCA), which was designed to distinguish between the two behaviors under standard living conditions. To assess anxiety in mice in an unfamiliar environment, exploratory activity was analyzed in an automated hole-board apparatus. Mice with bilateral Me 5 lesions had unique feeding and exploratory behavior profiles in the FSCA compared with sham-operated mice. Me 5 -lesioned mice spent more time in the <b>food</b> <b>chamber</b> during each trial in the FSCA, but the number of entries into the <b>food</b> <b>chamber</b> was decreased by 40 % compared to sham-operated mice. Moreover, Me 5 lesions markedly inhibited exploratory behavior, manifested as low-frequency exploration. In spite of the low frequency exploration in the FSCA, Me 5 lesions had no effect on various exploratory activities analyzed in the hole-board apparatus, i. e., total locomotor activity, frequency and duration of rearing and head-dipping, and latency to the first head-dipping. These results suggest that the Me 5 is involved in the control of feeding and exploratory behavior through its ascending neuronal pathways in mice without modulating the emotional state. [URL]...|$|E

The main goal was to analyze {{the perception of the}} origin of the products in terms of consumers that prefer to buy Czech products, and which designations of Czech origin on products they trust. In particular, the work deals with the so-called "official designations" of Czech origin, for example "Regionální potravina" (Regional food), "Regionální produkt"(Regional product), "Český výrobek - garantováno Potravinářskou komorou České republiky"(Czech product - guaranteed by <b>Food</b> <b>Chamber</b> of the Czech Republic) and others. On the other hand, it highlights the presence of so-called "unofficial designations" and their influence on the consumer's perception. It is also focused on the legal issue of the Czech products. In the practical part of the thesis, we deal with the quantitative and qualitative research of the perception of Czech products to the consumer, which verifies the preference of Czech products and confidence in official designation of Czech origin. Finally, my work deals with the designation "made in EU" and its perception of the consumer. The conclusion of the work is that the studied subject is missing a legal description (in the Czech law system) and enables a manipulation with customers that are not familiar with the current system and could be misled...|$|E

In two of these <b>chambers,</b> <b>food</b> was available on variable-interval schedules of reinforcement. In Experiment I, nine combinations of variable intervals were used, and the aggregate lever-pressing rates (by the five rats together) were studied. The log ratio of the rates in the two chambers was linearly related to the log ratio of the reinforcement rates in them; this is an instance of Herrnstein's matching law, as generalized by Baum. Summing over the two <b>food</b> <b>chambers,</b> <b>food</b> consumption decreased, and response output increased, as the time required to earn each pellet increased. In Experiment II, the behavior of individual rats was observed by time-sampling on selected days, while different variable-interval schedules were arranged in the two <b>chambers</b> where <b>food</b> was available. Individual lever-pressing rates for the rats were obtained, and their median bore the same “matching” relationship to the reinforcement rates as the group aggregate in Experiment I.

5000|$|Baird’s {{pocket gopher}} lives a solitary life {{underground}} {{with the ability}} to create burrows, which are its common form of living quarters. The only time a gopher may retreat from its burrow is during wet months, to avoid being flooded out. On average each burrow is 6 cm in diameter and is found at depths of 10 - 68 cm underground, making it possible for only one adult gopher to occupy a single burrow system. Burrow systems are very complex and range from 55 - 180 cm in length. The tunnels meander aimlessly through various feeding areas, which indicates that burrowing is primarily done in the search for food. An average mound created by G. breviceps is about 30 x 45 cm in length, and about 8 cm in height, and is crescent-shaped. During the winter months, the gopher creates special mounds that contain feeding galleries, a nesting chamber, a [...] "bathroom", and <b>food</b> storage <b>chambers.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Mongolian gerbil is a colonial, {{burrowing}} rodent inhabiting deserts and semideserts. The burrow and burrow-related activities play {{a central}} role in the gerbil 2 ̆ 7 s environmental adaptation and may be a focus for social interaction and territorial behavior. If the gerbil 2 ̆ 7 s territoriality is influenced by the characteristics of its residence then, even in captivity, experimental environments closer to its natural habitat should foster stronger aggressive responses toward intruders than more dissimilar ones. Furthermore, potentially reproductive female-male pairs should be more affected by the presence of burrows than unisexual male pairs. ^ A partition divided a 183 x 61 x 61 cm (6 x 2 x 2 ft) enclosure into two equal compartments. In three different environmental conditions, part of the floor was either left in place or removed to give access to tanks filled with dirt or hay. In two social conditions one female-male pair or two males were introduced in each of the two compartments. In the 2 ̆ 2 Dirt 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Hay 2 ̆ 2 condition the animals burrowed and built underground nests and <b>food</b> <b>chambers.</b> In 2 ̆ 2 Flat 2 ̆ 2 they built shallow surface nests.

The female-male groups showed maximal aggressiveness toward intruders in Dirt and less in Hay and Flat, whereas the male-male groups were not significantly affected by environmental change. The measures of mild fighting, threat, and chasing present a less clear picture and are discussed in terms of possible influences of the experimental arrangement. The differences in behavior between the female-male and male-male groups are discussed in terms of differential reactivity to environmental conditions and differences in the nature of the aggression displayed. It is argued that the agonism of the male-male groups may have been regulated by dominance relationships, whereas the aggressiveness of the female-male groups was of a predominantly territorial nature. The susceptibility of these two forms of social utilization of space to environmental and social conditions is discussed. ...|$|R
