50|$|Accountability {{and value}} consistency.Some {{prejudice}} reduction strategies rely on creating {{a sense of}} internal conflict.

This creates cognitive dissonance, and people attempt to resolve this tension by reducing expressions of prejudice. For example, after agreeing to write a public statement advocating a policy that is beneficial to racial minorities but costly to whites, whites report more personal support for this policy than before being asked to write the public statement.|$|R
