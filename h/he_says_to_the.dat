[...] 'Ali answered, [...] "I adjure you by God, do {{you know that}} Mu'awiyah was more afraid of Umar than was Umar's own slave Yarfa?" [...] "Yes," [...] said (Uthman). 'Ali went on, [...] "In fact Mu'awiyah makes decisions on issues without [...] you, and you know it. Thus, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people. 'This is Uthman's command.' You hear of this, but do not censure him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And you're doing well, Mr. George?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> trooper, {{squarely}} standing faced about {{towards him}} with his broadsword in his hand. [...] "You are prospering, please the Powers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{what did}} <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offer? did <b>he</b> {{not make any}} {{comments}} on it? He was not offended at it, I hope," [...] demanded Mr. Benfield.|$|R
6000|$|Fanny hardly spoke a word. There was {{her father}} before her {{and she could not}} eat, much less talk, as she thought of all {{that she would have to}} go through. What would <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of having an American for a son-in-law? ...|$|R
50|$|He asked Ea what <b>he</b> should <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city {{elders and}} the population.|$|R
6000|$|His name is George, {{generally}} speaking. [...] "Call me George!" [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heroine. She {{calls him}} George (in {{a very low}} voice, because she is so young and timid). Then he is happy.|$|E
6000|$|Fig. 21 {{is that of}} Prof. Schuster, F.R.S., whose visualising {{powers are}} of a very high order, and who has given me {{valuable}} information, but want of space compels me to extract very briefly. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> effect:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so; {{but three}} hundred pounds never hurt anybody--never, Mr. George; and I {{can tell you}} this: if you play your cards well, you may be the old gentleman's heir, {{in spite of all}} <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary." ...|$|E
5000|$|Finding {{no other}} way to be together, Joe and Katsumi commit double suicide. This {{strengthens}} Ace's resolve to marry Hana-ogi. When a Stars and Stripes reporter asks him what will <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> [...] "big brass" [...] as well as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Japanese, neither of which will be particularly happy, Ace says, [...] "Tell 'em we said, 'Sayonara.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|How is this? What is {{this strange}} thing, without which even the true {{knowledge}} of doctrine {{is of no}} use; which, if a man, or a nation has not, he is poor, and blind, and wretched, and naked in soul, {{in spite of all}} his religion? Isaiah will tell us--What did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Jews in his day? ...|$|R
6000|$|Henri was awe-stricken, and cut <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart. What was <b>he</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> poor wretch, {{who stood}} there upon his guard, glaring {{at him with}} those wild eyes from behind his sword! Besides, how was he to defend himself if he were attacked? ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"My brother," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indian. [...] "I {{think this}} is the hand of Providence! I warned that Gert if he went to play upon the wharves any more he would hear from me. Now look at this boy and say what you think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None o' your business! You {{keep your}} head shet, and mind y'r own affairs--if you got any. Long as you're in this town don't you forgit THAT--you hear?" [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> duke, [...] "We got to jest swaller it and say noth'n': mum's the word for US." ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, perhaps old First Premium was a little; {{because he}} stopped [...] them. [...] "My dear," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old hen-turkey, and chick-chickledren, [...] "you forget yourselves; {{you should have}} a little consideration. [...] Perhaps you wouldn't behave much better yourselves if you were just [...] going to be eaten." ...|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> feast, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> goodbye <b>to</b> <b>the</b> communityand revokes {{into the}} bois sacr√©.|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you know," [...] <b>he</b> was <b>saying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> girl at {{the same}} moment, [...] "it's like some of those Dore {{illustrations}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Inferno, or the Wandering Jew." ...|$|R

6000|$|He says it {{with such}} a pitiable air, and his grimy tears appear so real, and he lies in the corner up against the {{hoarding}} so like a growth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in neglect and impurity, that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards him. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> woman, [...] "Miserable creature, what has he done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'When ye {{were the}} {{servants}} of sin,' <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Romans, 'what fruit had ye in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? For {{the end of}} those things is death. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.

6000|$|... '"You first," [...] he says, and flings {{the cage}} {{out of the}} window. [...] "Now you," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> yellow dog, putting him out through the door. And then he folds his arms and scowls at us, and we all notice {{suddenly}} that he's very big. We look at one another, and we begins to edge towards the door. All except Jane, who's staring at Jerry as if he's a ghost.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Grace, a Democrat, {{was asked}} what <b>he</b> would <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{campaign}} theme of Walter Mondale, the 1984 Democratic Presidential candidate, that higher taxes would be required <b>to</b> ease <b>the</b> deficit regardless of who wins the November election.|$|R
60|$|Duval {{then told}} him he must {{translate}} faithfully all <b>he</b> should <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Indians, without softening a word. The interpreter promised faithfully to do so, adding that he well knew, when they were once in the town, nothing but boldness could save them.|$|R
6000|$|For {{you must}} {{remember}} {{that there was a}} class of sinners in Judaea, to whom our Lord speaks no word of pity or forgiveness: namely, the very men who were his own personal enemies, who were persecuting him, and going about to kill him; and that therefore, by any hard words toward them, he must have laid himself open, just as much as David laid himself open, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imputation of personal spite. And yet, what did <b>he</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> scribes and Pharisees: 'Ye go about to kill me, and therefore I am bound <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing harsh concerning you'? What <b>he</b> did <b>say</b> was this: 'Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... (2.) Is there, in thy more retired condition, arguings, strugglings, and strivings with thy {{spirit to}} persuade thee of the vanity of what vain things thou lovest, and to win thee in thy soul to {{a choice of}} Christ Jesus and his heavenly things? Take heed and rebel not, for the day of God's grace and {{patience}} will not be past with thee till he saith, his 'Spirit shall strive no more' with thee; for then the woe comes, when he shall depart from them; and when <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> means of grace, Let them alone (Hosea 4:17; 9:12).|$|E
6000|$|... "To go back west is the {{shortest}} way, you see. It's only about seven thousand miles. If you went east, and so on around, it's over twice as far." [...] Then <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> guide, [...] "I want you both to watch the tell-tale all through the watches, and whenever it don't mark three hundred miles an hour, you go higher or drop lower till you find a storm-current that's going your way. There's a hundred miles an hour in this old thing without any wind to help. There's two-hundred-mile gales to be found, any {{time you want to}} hunt for them." ...|$|E

60|$|As it was yet {{early in}} the evening, and bright moonlight, he {{concluded}} to go around by the Wittons'. It was not far out of his way, {{and he wanted to}} see Miss Panney. What <b>he</b> wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old lady was not exactly evident to his own mind, but in a general way he wished her to know that Dora was at Cobhurst.|$|R
5000|$|... "What {{interested}} me most was <b>to</b> cover <b>the</b> different {{stages in the}} peace process which took place in that period," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says.</b> <b>To</b> witness <b>the</b> absurdity of war, while showing the values of peace is what Manoocher continued to do thereafter, in the Middle East as in North Africa and former Yugoslavia.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, {{and they}} are a hantle mair pious and devout than ever a body I hae seen in Eyemouth, or a' <b>the</b> country side <b>to</b> boot; forbye, my minnie's auld auntie, that sat graning by the ingle, and ay banned us when we came ben.

60|$|Over all {{the legal}} {{neighbourhood}} there hangs, like some great veil of rust or gigantic cobweb, the idleness and pensiveness {{of the long}} vacation. Mr. Snagsby, law-stationer of Cook's Court, Cursitor Street, is sensible of the influence not only in his mind as a sympathetic and contemplative man, but also in his business as a law-stationer aforesaid. He has more leisure for musing in Staple Inn and in the Rolls Yard during the long vacation than at other seasons, and <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> two 'prentices, what a thing it is in such hot weather {{to think that you}} live in an island with the sea a-rolling and a-bowling right round you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Those are not letter-boxes, {{they are}} birds' nests. You must {{understand}} this nation. The German loves birds, but he likes tidy birds. A bird left to himself builds his nest just anywhere. It {{is not a}} pretty object, according to the German notion of prettiness. There is not a bit of paint on it anywhere, not a plaster image all round, not even a flag. The nest finished, the bird proceeds to live outside it. He drops things on the grass; twigs, ends of worms, all sorts of things. He is indelicate. He makes love, quarrels with his wife, and feeds the children quite in public. The German householder is shocked. <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bird: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The Navy was in it. I was {{the only}} one out of it--for several seconds. Our Mr. Morshed failed to {{recognise}} me in my fur boa, and my appealin' winks at 'im behind your goggles didn't arrive. But when Eddy darling had told his story, I saluted, which is difficult in furs, and I stated I was bringin' him dispatches from the North. My Mr. Morshed cohered on the instant. I've never known his ethergram installations out of order yet. [...] "Go and guard your blessed road," [...] <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fratton Orphan Asylum standing at attention all round him, and, when they was removed--"Pyecroft," [...] he says, still sotte voce, [...] "what in Hong-Kong are you doing with this dun-coloured sampan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The parson had by {{no means}} {{made up his mind}} as to what <b>he</b> was <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> young lady, so he shut his eyes, and rushed at once into the middle of his subject. [...] "Miss Wyndham," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have come a long way}} to call on you, at the request of a friend of yours--a very dear and old friend of mine--at the request of Lord Ballindine." ...|$|R
60|$|The threat sounded awful, {{but did not}} alarm Jo, for {{she knew}} the irascible old gentleman would never lift a finger against his grandson, {{whatever}} <b>he</b> might <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary. She obediently descended, and made as light of the prank as she could without betraying Meg or forgetting the truth.|$|R
25|$|Sohail {{was born}} and raised in Sakhakot Malakand Division in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. He played tennis-ball cricket from a young age and bowled at a lively pace, {{something}} <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> owes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> muscle strength he built up from throwing stones and swimming in rivers and streams present in the mountainous environment. Realising his potential and on the advice of a friend, he moved to Karachi to play professional cricket.|$|R
