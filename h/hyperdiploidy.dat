About 40 – 50 % of patients display <b>hyperdiploidy,</b> defined by recurrent trisomies of non-random chromosomes.

The differential expression of 225 genes mainly involved in protein biosynthesis, transcriptional machinery and oxidative phosphorylation distinguished the 28 H-MM from the 38 NH-MM cases.

40|$|Background  The {{most common}} {{chromosomal}} aberration found in meningiomas is monosomy 22. Progression and recurrence of meningiomas are {{usually associated with}} additional chromosome losses. Rarely, however, meningiomas have strongly hyperdiploid karyotypes with over 50 chromosomes; {{the objective of this}} study was to explore the cytogenetic and histopathologic patterns as well as the clinical significance of <b>hyperdiploidy</b> in meningiomas. Methods  Within a series of 677 consecutive meningiomas, we identified a subgroup comprising 16 cases that display a strikingly uniform pattern of <b>hyperdiploidy</b> mostly without structural chromosome rearrangements, as shown by banding techniques and, in the single structurally aberrant case, spectral karyotyping. Results  These meningiomas each have between 50 and 56 chromosomes, with trisomy 12 (14 / 16 cases), trisomy 20 (13 / 16 cases), trisomy 5 (12 / 16 cases), and trisomy 17 (10 / 16 cases). Histomorphologically, hyperdiploid meningiomas feature a heterogeneous phenotype. However, they are associated with a higher histological grade, and decreased expression of alkaline phosphatase as compared to meningiomas with typical karyotype. In two patients, recurrences were documented and three patients died of disease during the period of observation, indicating a worse prognosis of hyperdiploid than of cytogenetically typical meningiomas.

40|$|Background: Hyperdiploid pre-B-cell acute lymhoblastic leukemia (pre-B-ALL) is {{a common}} form of {{childhood}} leukemia with very good prognosis with present day chemotherapy. However, the chromosomal composition of the <b>hyperdiploidy</b> has not been extensively studied and possible mechanism for this pathology remains so far conjectural. Objective: To analyze the pattern of chromosome involvement in a cohort of childhood hyperdiploid pre-B-ALL from India and from this pattern to develop an understanding on the causation of such pathology. Whether such patients also carry translocations and FLT 3 mutations {{in addition to their}} hyperdiploid karyotype. Materials and Methods: One hundred and twenty-six childhood pre-B-ALL patients were studied. Bone marrow aspirate of these patients were evacuated for morphology, FAB classification, immunophenotyping and both conventional and molecular cytogenetics. Results: Of 126 patients with pre-B-ALL (age 2 - 15 years), 90 patients with abnormal karyotype showed 50 with hyperdiploid karyotype (50 / 90 i. e. 55. 5 %). Chromosomes 9, 10, 14, 17, 18, 20 and 21 were more often involved in <b>hyperdiploidy.</b> Chromosome 21 duplication was present in 92 % of the cases.

Twenty-six girls and 34 boys with acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed in 1998 to 1999 were analyzed by FCM, GBK, and HR-CGH. The correlations between DNA indices obtained by FCM, GBK, and HR-CGH were significant (rs= 0. 61 to 0. 77; P< 0. 001 for all comparisons). However, in 4 of 18 patients, high <b>hyperdiploidy</b> was overlooked by GBK or HR-CGH, and even when FCM was applied, 2 of 18 patients with high <b>hyperdiploidy</b> by GBK and/or HR-CGH were classified as nonhigh hyperdiploid.

40|$|Among various {{methods for}} {{diagnosing}} malignant tumo r s, the morphological method is, of course, {{the most important}} one at the present time. Now, there is no decisive method for diagnosis of malignancy of a given single cell. The malignacy of the tumor cell group is merely judged by its histological structures and the destructive activity to the surrounding tissues. When benignancy or malignancy is determined in vesical tumors, we make reference to the classification proposed by Broders (1922) and Jewett-Strong (1946), but this classification is not a precise index of malignancy. From cytological point of view, it is supposed that the tumor is proliferation of undifferentiated cells preceeded by a variation in normal soma cells by some cause. On the other hand, abnormal proliferation of these undifferentiated cells seems to have a close relation to intracellular hereditary elements. Accordingly, study of the chromosomes which are the carrier of hereditary elements has probably a significance for explanation of the genesis of melignant tumors, the selection of treatment, or the prognosis. From this point of view, chromosomes in tumor ce l l s are comparatively investigated in connection with clinical symptoms, pathohistological findings, etc. The chromosomes were stained with acetic dahlia after hy p otonic treatment. The nuclear type was analyzed by the V. J. R. classification. The results of observation of the chrom o some number are shown in Table 4. The distribution is very wide. Case 25 demonstrates very wide distribution such as 61 - 201. Case 32 contains at least two triploid stem cells with 63 and 68 chromosomes. The stem cells are not constantly present and are 45 in minimum and 87 in maximum. The <b>hyperdiploidy</b> chromosomes are most frequently observed. Table 16 shows the chromosome composition. Cases 3 and 12 show the composition {{similar to that of the}} normal soma cells, but the other cases reveal the characteristic chromosome compositions in each case.

The interrelationship betwe e n the histological findings and the number of chromosome is summarized in Table 16, although the observation performed is a small number.

A simultaneous observation of the patho l ogical findings and the chromosome structure shows, regardless of Type of tumor development and Degree of infiltration, that the appearance of abnormal chromosomes plays a significant role for diagnosing the malignant tumor cells because of the composition characteristic of the malignant tumor. The number of the chromosome in the stern cells is diploidy in Type I, as shown Table 17, but then increases in number; in detail, the number is most large in Type II and B, moderately large in Type III and A or B, and slightly in Type IV. The number of the chromosome in the stem cells does not increase with the development of malignancy but in reverse reduces at a maximum of malignancy. It is supposed from these facts that the variation in the chromorome number and the analysis of the chromosome type are the important factors for distinguishing malignant cells from normal cells...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hyperdiploidy</b> {{is a rare}} {{finding in}} acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and the cases {{described}} so far showed characteristic large and bizarre blasts. We further demonstrate this morphologic/karyotypic relationship {{in a case of}} hyperdiploid AML by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Together with previous observations, we propose that in myeloid leukemias, increase in DNA content is accompanied by a corresponding increase in blast size. If large and bizarre blasts are shown on morphologic analysis, polyploid metaphases on cytogenetic preparations should also be analyzed, as they may be derived from these cells. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} several polyamines found in seminal fluid {{on the cell}} cycle and ploidy of three {{cervical}} cell lines and of primary epithelial cells cultured from cervical biopsy specimens were monitored by fluorescent flow cytometry. The rate of cell growth did not change but there were indications of either hypodiploidy or <b>hyperdiploidy</b> in some cultures at certain concentrations of spermine and spermidine. An interaction of exogenous polyamines with the DNA of cervical cells was shown to occur, leading to changes in ploidy with, perhaps, the potential to induce or promote dysplasia...|$|E
40|$|Epidemiologic {{studies of}} {{childhood}} leukemia have made limited use of tumor genetic characteristics, {{which may be}} related to disease etiology. We characterized the cytogenetics of 543 childhood leukemia patients (0 - 14 years of age) enrolled in the Northern California Childhood Leukemia Study, an approximately population-based study comprised primarily of Hispanics (42 %) and non-Hispanic Whites (41 %), and compared the cytogenetic profiles between these two ethnic groups. Subjects were classified by immunophenotype, conventional cytogenetic characteristics, and fluorescence in situ hybridization findings. The ploidy levels most frequently observed among acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were high <b>hyperdiploidy</b> (51 - 67 chromosomes) and pseudodiploid...|$|E
40|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common extracranial solid tumour of childhood. Amplification of the proto-oncogene, N-myc, confers a poor {{prognosis}} in neuroblastoma, while <b>hyperdiploidy</b> is associated with a favourable outcome. Little is known about the contribution of tumour-suppressor genes to the development or progression of neuroblastoma. We examined allelic imbalance at the locus of the tumour-suppressor gene, APC (adenomatous polyposis coli), on chromosome 5 q using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based assay. Nine of 24 (37. 5 %) informative neuroblastoma tumours showed allelic imbalance (AI) at this locus. Clinical data concerning N-myc amplification and DNA content were correlated with these results in the same patients. Allelic imbalance was found only in tumours containing a single copy of the N-myc gene and exhibiting <b>hyperdiploidy.</b> All nine patients with AI of chromosome 5 q were alive after a median follow-up period of 46 months, while 7 of 15 (47 %) of those lacking AI at this locus had died (P = 0. 018). Allelic imbalance at three additional loci on chromosome 5 was demonstrated in tumours that exhibited AI at the APC locus, suggesting that endoreduplication of chromosome 5 had occurred. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of tumour tissue from one patient exhibiting AI demonstrated two, three, four or six copies of the APC gene per cell, consistent with this hypothesis. These data suggest that allelic imbalance of chromosome 5 is involved in at least a subset of neuroblastomas and influences survival in patients with neuroblastoma...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hyperdiploidy</b> {{sometimes}} {{is found in}} mycosis fungoides–Sézary syndrome, but its diagnostic significance remains undefined. We report an unusual case of Sézary syndrome manifesting with leukemic large cell transformation. Conventional karyotypic analysis showed {{the presence of a}} near-tetraploid neoplastic clone. With dual-color cytometric analysis, we showed that the large Sézary cells were near-tetraploid with a DNA index of 1. 86, thereby demonstrating a direct relationship between cell size and ploidy. Comparative genomic hybridization further showed chromosomal imbalances that were not revealed on conventional karyotyping. Our findings suggest that <b>hyperdiploidy</b> may be a marker of large cell transformation, so that when this karyotypic abnormality is found in mycosis fungoides–Sézary syndrome, a search for such a complication is indicated. Mycosis fungoides is a malignant disorder of T-helper cells characterized by proliferation of CD 3 + CD 4 + CD 8 – small lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei in the skin. The disease shows a slow progression, sometimes with progres-sive involvement of the lymph nodes, visceral organs, bone marrow, and blood (Sézary syndrome). 1, 2 Large cell transfor-mation can occur in mycosis fungoides–Sézary syndrome. In most cases, the large cell transformation is demonstrated in solitary tumor infiltrates involving the skin and visceral organs. 3, 4 Although circulating large lymphoma cells some-times can be found in Sézary syndrome, 5 a leukemic phase composed solely of large cells has not been reported. We describe the conventional and molecular cytogenetic findings of a case of Sézary syndrome manifesting with leukemic large cell transformation...|$|E
40|$|Cytogenetic {{classification}} of 350 adults with {{acute lymphoblastic leukaemia}} on MRC UKALL XA trial showed the following statistically significant associations: t(9; 22) (11 %) increased with increasing age and leucocyte counts (WBC) and most had a C/pre-B immunophenotype. t(4; 11) (3 %) was associated with higher WBCs, increasing age and null immunophenotype. Other abnormalities of 11 q (abn 11 q) (4 %) were associated with male sex and T-cell ALL. High <b>hyperdiploidy</b> (7 %) and abn 9 p (5 %) decreased with increasing WBC. High hyperdiploid patients were younger and tended to have C/pre-B ALL. Triploidy/tetraploidy (3 %) decreased and pseudodiploidy (11 %) increased with increasing WBC. Cytogenetic classification was prognostically important (chi-square for heterogeneity of classification = 53. 56; P < 0. 0001) and added significance to age, sex and WBC. A poor prognosis for patients classed as t(9; 22) (13 % disease-free survival at 3 years), as t(4; 11) 24 % at 3 years) and hypodiploid (11 % at 3 years), and good prognosis for abn 12 p (4 % of subjects) and high <b>hyperdiploidy</b> (74 % and 59 % at 3 years respectively) were statistically significant, but the 54 % 3 -year disease-free survival for patients with t(1; 19) was not. The prognosis of patients classed as t(9; 22) was independent of other single variables. Abn 12 p, abnormalities of 11 q (including t(4; 11) cases) and hypodiploidy added prognostic significance to all other variables combined...|$|E
