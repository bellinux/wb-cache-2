60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and his calmness was {{restored}} to him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> Every word he was {{compelled}} to measure.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{with his}} hand upon the {{fastening}} of the door.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> contradiction, but {{she nodded}} her head in agreement.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reply, {{but nobody}} had any {{information}} to impart.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few moments, and {{the scout}} gravely {{waited for him}} to resume.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> set the {{machinery}} working again, and delivered five {{more at the}} pithead.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and then}} {{suddenly}} continued. His voice had broken. He spoke in quick nervous sentences.|$|E
60|$|Ramsden thought Philip {{hard and}} cold. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, looking {{about him in}} a perplexed way.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment; <b>he</b> let {{his head}} droop on his breast, then {{suddenly}} raised it again.|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while, and, hearing no dissent, {{walked down}} the hall and out of the door.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> softer word {{than the}} one that had risen to his lips, and she took it away from him.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment.</b> A flush dyed his worn face, and {{his voice}} was {{strained}} when he went on again.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and then}} his voice became hoarse as he {{indicated}} the clustering men with a little forceful gesture.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> while I {{asked him}} if he could {{remember}} the nature of the country through which he had journeyed.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Now, Monsieur Rigaud,' said <b>he,</b> <b>pausing</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{moment at}} the grate, with his keys in his hands, 'have the {{goodness}} to come out.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few minutes, threw {{from him}} his helmet, then strode down the hill, {{and took the}} road to King Richard's pavilion.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer. Cranly {{dislodged}} a figseed {{from his}} teeth {{on the point}} of his rude toothpick and gazed at it intently.|$|R
60|$|They {{crossed the}} road and turned into St. James's Park. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{to look at the}} front of Buckingham Palace.|$|E
60|$|Dan's frank manner {{apparently}} {{impressed the}} Mexican officer favourably, for he breathed more freely. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{as if in}} deep thought.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{apparently}} {{feeling the}} stress of it again, {{and there was a}} faint thrill in his voice when he went on.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> answer; but Darsie, overawed by {{the energy}} of his manner, and unwilling to commit himself by a hasty explanation, {{remained}} silent.|$|R
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> reply, {{she felt}} herself bound to say something. [...] "Oh, yes, I do," [...] she said,--"as well as anybody else." ...|$|R
6000|$|Here <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, and {{concealed}} {{his face}} behind his pocket-handkerchief. Then, smiling faintly, {{and holding the}} bed furniture with one hand, he resumed: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> or two, {{and looked}} {{steadily}} at her. He {{was anxious to}} watch the effect {{of what he was}} going to say.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> and, {{as though}} unconsciously he were calling back the mood which had then seized him, {{he began to}} walk more slowly.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment,</b> {{and drank}} from his tumbler. There were dark lines under his eyes, and I felt that I ought {{to stop him}} talking.|$|E
6000|$|... "Weathercock can {{without the}} wind," [...] {{suggested}} Jo, as <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> simile. Jo had grown quite her own saucy self again since Teddy came home.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I have,' {{said the}} dismal man hurriedly; 'I have. More {{than those who}} see me now would believe possible.' <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> instant, and then said abruptly-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{shall be}} a {{mourning}} bride," [...] cried the king savagely, [...] "unless"--here <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment--"unless {{you bring me}} back Alphohso and Enrico, safe and well!" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{thought the}} {{explanation}} sufficient, but <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> after giving it. [...] "As in a flock bed, you know," [...] he added and resumed his discourse.|$|E
60|$|He obeyed, {{and they}} made their way into the crowded street. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> on the pavement. The {{pleasure}} swirl was creeping a little into his veins.|$|E
60|$|Frank's face color'd a little, too. <b>He</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> {{in thought}} --he was really foot-sore, and {{exhausted}} with his journey that hot day--so he accepted his brother's offer.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> pass-key rattled in {{the hall}} door {{and a moment later}} Patsy Doyle, rosy and animated, fresh from the cold and wet outside, smilingly greeted them.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>paused,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{note of the}} conch {{was heard}} rising {{gradually}} on the air, until {{the whole of the}} wide valley was filled with its rich and melancholy sound.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thy labour is not light, Kettle," [...] {{observed}} Ulf to the thrall as <b>he</b> <b>paused</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{few moments}} {{in the midst of}} his work to wipe his heated brow.|$|R
