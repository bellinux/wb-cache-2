40|$|A {{general purpose}} diode that couples high <b>forward</b> <b>conductance</b> fast swiching speed and high {{blocking}} voltages {{in a glass}} leadless LL- 34 surface mount package. Placement of the expansion gap has no relationship {{to the location of}} the cathode terminal which is indicated by the first color band. Absolute Maximum Ratings (1) Stresses exceeding the absolute maximum ratings may damage the device. The device may not function or be operable above the recommended operating conditions and stressing the parts to these levels is not recommended. In addition, extended exposure to stresses above the recommended operating conditions may affect device reliability. The absolute maximum ratings are stress ratings only. Values are at TA = 25 °C unless otherwise noted...|$|E
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} the experiment are to determine zero-g start-up performance for conventional and diode low temperature heat pipes, to evaluate heat pipe performance in zero-g {{for an extended period}} of time, to determine zero-g transport capability of each heat pipe, and to determine diode operation, including <b>forward</b> <b>conductance,</b> turndown ratio, and transient behavior. Two heat pipes, a fixed conductance transporter heat pipe and a thermal diode heat pipe, are coupled with a radiant cooler system. Both pipes are charged with ethane. Also integrated with the radiator is a phase change material (PCM) canister which provides temperature stability during transport tests. N-heptane, which has a melting/freezing point of 182 K, is used as the PCM. The high heat capacity (28 W-hr of latent heat) provided by the canister permits high power heat pipe testing at constant temperature...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{transfer}} matrix approach that combines the Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk (BTK) formalism and self-consistent {{solutions to the}} Bogolibuov-de Gennes (BdG) equations {{and use it to}} study the tunneling conductance and spin transport in ferromagnet (F) -superconductor (S) trilayers (F_ 1 F_ 2 S) as functions of bias voltage. The self-consistency ensures that the spin and charge conservation laws are properly satisfied. We consider forward and angularly averaged conductances over a broad range of the strength of the exchange fields and F thicknesses, as the relative in-plane magnetization angle, ϕ, between the two ferromagnets varies. The ϕ-dependence of the self-consistent conductance curves in the trilayers can differ substantially from that obtained via a non-self-consistent approach. The zero bias <b>forward</b> <b>conductance</b> peak exhibits, as ϕ varies, resonance effects intricately associated with particular combinations of the geometrical and material parameters. We find, when the magnetizations are non-collinear, signatures of the anomalous Andreev reflections in the subgap regions of the angularly averaged conductances. When F_ 1 is half-metallic, the angularly averaged subgap conductance chiefly arises from anomalous Andreev reflection. The in-plane components of the spin current are strongly bias dependent, while the out-of-plane spin current component is only weakly dependent upon voltage. The components of the spin current aligned with the local exchange field of one of the F layers are conserved in that layer and in the S region, while they oscillate in the other layer. We compute the spin transfer torques, in connection with the oscillatory behavior of spin currents, and verify that the spin continuity equation is strictly obeyed in our method.

30|$|Layers of {{palladium}} (Pd) nanoparticles on {{indium phosphide}} (InP) were prepared by electrophoretic deposition from the colloid solution of Pd nanoparticles. Layers prepared by an opposite polarity of deposition showed different physical and morphological properties. Particles in solution are separated and, after deposition onto the InP surface, they form small aggregates. The {{size of the}} aggregates {{is dependent on the}} time of deposition. If the aggregates are small, the layer has no lateral <b>conductance.</b> <b>Forward</b> and reverse I-V characteristics showed a high rectification ratio with a high Schottky barrier height. The response of the structure on the presence of hydrogen was monitored.|$|R
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} simulation-based Bayesian imaging from {{electrical impedance}} tomographic data, by summarizing {{the set of}} conductance images which could give rise to the data. The <b>forward</b> map from <b>conductance</b> image to data requires the solution of a partial differential equation subject to boundary conditions. We develop the example of recovering an unknown convex polygonal insulating inclusion within an object made of otherwise uniformly conducting material, and illustrate our methods with noisy synthetic data. Sampling is carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo with {{the efficiency of the}} algorithm investigated over a range of noise levels. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} adsorbed oxygen and {{hydrogen}} gas on porous silicon {{has been investigated}} using two different techniques, viz. optical and electrical. The photoluminescence quenching by oxygen and hydrogen {{was found to be}} reversible with a response time of the order of 3000 s. Unlike any reported porous silicon gas quenching systems, both the extent and rate of quenching were found to be a function of photoluminescence wavelength. The quenching is attributed to charge transfer from the conduction band of porous silicon to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of oxygen and hydrogen, respectively. Surface conductance measurements (aluminium contacts) show that the principal charge transfer process is via tunnelling, with some conduction through the underlying bulk p-type silicon layer. Symmetrical current-voltage plots were obtained for this system which were attributed to pinning of the aluminium-porous silicon Fermi level at mid-gap by the high surface trap density. An approximate doubling of the aluminium electrode separation was found to reduce approximately fourfold the initial rate of increase in surface conductance on adsorption of oxygen at a pressure of 10 torr. To the best of the author's knowledge {{this is the first time}} that such an effect has been reported in a room temperature solid state gas sensor. Gas sensitivity measurements using surface contacts show a logarithmic response to the concentration of oxygen up to a pressure of 100 torr with a rapid response, of 300 s. A 39 % increase in surface conductance occurs on exposure of the device to 100 torr of oxygen. The surface conductance of the device decreases by 34 % on exposure to one atmosphere of hydrogen with a response time of the order 2000 s. Transverse conductance (DC) measurements show that Au/PS/p-Si/Al [...] Ag devices behave like a field-dependent diode. An admittance spectroscopy technique has been applied to porous silicon for the first time to calculate g_ 0, the trap density at the Fermi level, which was found to be 3 x 10 " 1 " 8 cm"-" 3 eV"-" 1. The often-reported high ideality factors (i. e. a value greater than one) for metal-porous silicon junctions have been interpreted in terms of the high defect density in porous silicon. Transverse impedance measurements (viz. : parallel capacitance and conductance) on exposure to hydrogen show a strong dependency upon the applied frequency and bias. Capacitance of a Au/PS/p-Si/Al [...] Ag device only shows a response to hydrogen in two frequency windows 100 Hz < f < 2. 5 kHz and 100 kHz < f < 1 MHz. The low frequency window has been attributed to interfacial interactions whilst the high frequency window has been attributed to dipolar interactions. The conductance of a gold-porous silicon device increases on exposure to hydrogen when under reverse bias at all frequencies tested. Under <b>forward</b> bias the <b>conductance</b> decreases at all frequencies tested. The capacitance and conductance of a gold-porous silicon device increase on exposure to oxygen at most frequencies and biases tested. It has been reported in the literature that the zero-bias capacitance and resistance of a porous silicon device show no change on adsorption of oxygen or hydrogen. This apparent anomaly may be explained by the present author's observation that the device AC characteristics following gas adsorption are bias-dependent. Measurements at zero bias alone may give a misleading null result. The interaction with oxygen is due to the injection of holes into the porous silicon valence band by the formation of O_ 2 "- ions on the porous silicon surface.
