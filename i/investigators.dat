5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, <b>investigators</b> have not determined {{the location of}} the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when <b>investigators</b> reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, <b>investigators</b> have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E

5|$|In the UK {{the same}} laws {{covering}} computer crime can also affect forensic <b>investigators.</b> The 1990 computer misuse act legislates against unauthorised access to computer material; {{this is a}} particular concern for civil <b>investigators</b> who have more limitations than law enforcement.|$|E
5|$|<b>Investigators</b> {{were able}} to {{identify}} the point of origin of the disintegration as an area immediately ahead of {{the leading edge of the}} aircraft's right wing.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{nature of}} the {{relationship}} between a clinical <b>investigator</b> and a research subject has generated considerable debate because the <b>investigator</b> occupies two distinct roles: clinician and scientist. As a clinician, the <b>investigator</b> has duties to provide the patient with optimal care and undivided loyalty. As a scientist, the <b>investigator</b> has duties to follow the rules, procedures and methods described in the protocol. Results and conclusion In this article, I present a contextual approach to the investigator-subject relationship. The extent of the <b>investigator's</b> duty to provide the patient/subject with clinical care can vary from one situation to the next, as a function of several factors, including: the research design, benefits and risks of the research; the subject's reasonable expectations, motivations, and vulnerabilities; the <b>investigator's</b> ability to benefit the subject; and the <b>investigator's</b> prior relationship with the subject. These and other factors need to be considered when determining the clinical <b>investigator's</b> obligations to provide clinical care to human research subjects. In some research contexts, the <b>investigator</b> has extensive clinical obligations to the patient/subject; in others, the <b>investigator</b> has minimal ones. </p...|$|R

5|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), {{part of the}} Department of Transportation, {{were the}} primary <b>investigators</b> into the crash of Flight 2511. The {{wreckage}} of the DC-6 {{was taken to a}} hangar at nearby Wilmington Airport, where the fuselage was reassembled on a wood-and-chicken-wire frame. <b>Investigators</b> recovered approximately 90% of the fuselage, which was then assembled on the frame in the Wilmington hangar.|$|E
5|$|Through {{ballistics}} examination, {{law enforcement}} <b>investigators</b> determined that Cho used the Glock 19 pistol during the attacks at the West Ambler Johnston dormitory and at Norris Hall on the Virginia Tech campus. Police <b>investigators</b> found that Cho fired more than 170 shots during the killing spree, evidenced by technicians finding at least 17 empty magazines at the scene.

5|$|Among <b>investigators</b> {{there is}} {{disagreement}} regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some <b>investigators</b> believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E
