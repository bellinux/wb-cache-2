5|$|Macedonia (as {{a current}} {{geographical}} term) {{refers to a}} region of the Balkan peninsula <b>in</b> <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> covering some 60,000 or 70,000 square kilometers. Although the region's borders are not officially defined by any international organization or state, in some contexts, the territory appears to correspond to the basins of (from west to east) the Haliacmon (Aliákmonas), Vardar / Axios and Struma / Strymónas rivers, and the plains around Thessaloniki and Serres.|$|E
5|$|U 956 {{was first}} {{documented}} by Johannes Haquini Rhezelius (d. 1666), {{and later by}} Johan Peringskiöld (1710), who commented that the inscription was legible {{in spite of the}} stone having been split in two parts. Unlike modern scholars, Peringskiöld connected this stone, like the other Greece runestones, to the Gothic wars <b>in</b> <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> from the 3rd century and onwards. Olof Celsius visited the stone three times, and the last time was in 1726 together with his nephew Anders Celsius. Olof Celsius noted that Peringskiöld had been wrong and that the stone was intact, although it gives an impression of being split in two, and the same observation was made by Richard Dybeck in 1866.|$|E

25|$|Bulgaria is {{a country}} {{situated}} <b>in</b> <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> bordering Romania to the north, Serbia and the Republic of Macedonia to the west, Greece and Turkey to the south, and the Black Sea to the east. The northern border with Romania follows the river Danube until the city of Silistra. The land area of Bulgaria is , slightly larger than that of Iceland or the U.S. state of Tennessee. Considering its relatively small size, Bulgaria has {{a great variety of}} topographical features. Even within small parts of the country, the land may be divided into plains, plateaus, hills, mountains, basins, gorges, and deep river valleys. The geographic center of Bulgaria is located in Uzana.|$|E
25|$|The European Union {{promotes}} various initiatives regarding {{work-life balance}} and encourages its {{member states to}} implement family-friendly policies. In Europe, the Working Time Directive has implemented a maximum 48-hour working week. Many countries have opted for fewer hours. France introduced a 35-hour workweek. Contradictory to the Scandinavian countries, {{there is no evidence}} of state policies that absolutely encourage men to take on a larger share of domestic work in France, Portugal, or Britain. In a 2007, the European Quality of Life Survey found that countries <b>in</b> <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> had the most common problems with work–life balance. In Croatia and Greece, a little over 70% of working citizens say that they are too tired to do household jobs at least several times a month because of work.|$|E

25|$|However, {{the crisis}} {{did not exist}} in a void; it came after a long series of {{diplomatic}} clashes between the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in {{the balance of power in}} Europe since 1870. An example is the Baghdad Railway which was planned to connect the Ottoman Empire cities of Konya and Baghdad with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War. Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the Balkans. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The Balkan Wars were two wars <b>in</b> <b>South-eastern</b> <b>Europe</b> in 1912–1913 in the course of which the Balkan League (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.|$|E
500|$|Hail occurs most {{frequently}} within continental interiors at mid-latitudes and is less {{common in the}} tropics, despite a much higher frequency of thunderstorms than in the mid-latitudes. Hail is also much more common along mountain ranges because mountains force horizontal winds upwards (known as orographic lifting), thereby intensifying the updrafts within thunderstorms and making hail more likely. [...] The higher elevations also result in there being less time available for hail to melt before reaching the ground. One of the more common regions for large hail is across mountainous northern India, which reported {{one of the highest}} hail-related death tolls on record in 1888. [...] China also experiences significant hailstorms. Central Europe and southern Australia also experience a lot of hailstorms. Popular regions for hailstorms are southern and western Germany, northern and eastern France and southern and eastern Benelux. <b>In</b> <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> Croatia and Serbia experience frequent occurrences of hail.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{beginning}} of the war <b>in</b> <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe,</b> there were clear ideological differences between largely conservative British establishment (government, senior military officers and civil servants, and the leadership of SOE) and mainly left-wing resistance movements on the ground. [...] The establishment had obligations towards kings and governments in exile whom it was committed to restoring to throne and power. [...] The resistance fighters while happy to take up arms against the foreign invaders, often suffered from crudely militaristic tyrannies imposed by those same reactionary kings and governments throughout 1920s and 1930s, and were unwilling to fight for their restoration to power.|$|E
2500|$|Romanians, {{known by}} the exonym Vlachs in the Middle Ages, speak a {{language}} descended from the Vulgar Latin that was once spoken <b>in</b> <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b> Inscriptions from the Roman period prove that a line, known as the [...] "Jireček Line", can be drawn through the Balkan Peninsula, which separated the Latin-speaking northern provinces, including Dacia, Moesia and Pannonia from the southern regions where Greek remained the predominant language. Eastern Romance now has four variants, which are former dialects of a Proto-Romanian language. Daco-Romanian, the official language of Romania, is the most widespread of the four variants. Speakers of the Aromanian language live in scattered communities in Albania, Bulgaria, Greece and Macedonia. Another two, by now nearly extinct variants, Megleno-Romanian and Istro-Romanian, are spoken in some villages in Macedonia and Greece, and in Croatia, respectively.|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Constantine VII's De Administrando Imperio {{contains}} {{the most detailed}} information {{on the history of}} the region in the first decades of the 10thcentury. It reveals that Patzinakia, the Pechenegs' land was bordered by Bulgaria on the Lower Danube around 950, and the Hungarians lived on the rivers Criş, Mureş, Timiş, Tisa and Toutis at the same time. That the Pechenegs's land was located next to Bulgaria is confirmed by the contemporary Abraham ben Jacob. The 10th-century Muslim scholars, Al-Muqaddasi and Ibn al-Nadim mentioned the Waladj and the Blaghā, respectively in their lists of peoples. The list also refer to the Khazars, Alans, and Greeks, and it is possible that the two ethnonyms refer to Vlachs dwelling somewhere <b>in</b> <b>south-eastern</b> <b>Europe.</b> For instance, the historian Alexandru Madgearu says that Al-Muqaddasi's work is the first reference to Romanians living north of the Danube.

2500|$|The {{fossil fuels}} include coal, {{petroleum}} and natural gas. Bulgaria possesses significant reserves of coal estimated at 4,8 billion tons.

The reserves of sub-bituminous coal are 300 million tons, situated mainly near Bobov Dol, Pernik and Burgas. The recoverable reserves of bituminous coal and anthracite are insignificant— only 10 and 2,5 million tons respectively. However, there is a huge basin of bituminous coal in Southern Dobruja with estimated reserves of over 1 billion tons but its large depth (1370–1950m) is an obstacle for its commercial exploitation.|$|E
