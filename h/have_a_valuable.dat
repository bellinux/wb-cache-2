2500|$|Benz's {{automobile}} was {{belt driven}} from an engine. Lambert felt {{if he could}} make a lightweight gasoline engine that did not operate with belts to propel it he would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> transportation vehicle that could be utilized in the United States. Lambert hired Wacholtz to work with him on building a balanced motor containing three cylinders. He agreed to pay for all the expenses of the development of such an engine. The machine was done by Lowell Machine Works of Cleveland, Ohio. One of the reasons the engine was fabricated in Cleveland was because they had gasoline available there. He also had the design and the body of [...] "horseless carriage" [...] done there. Also the running gears for the automobile were fabricated there. Lambert went to extremes to have the engine made lightweight. This was the first experience Lambert had with building an automobile engine. He originally agreed to spend $200 for the machine work to produce the automobile engine, however after spending $3,300 Wacholtz was not able to produce a working engine in Cleveland.|$|E

60|$|DEAR MR. HALL,--I want {{to throw}} out a {{suggestion}} {{and see what you}} think of it. We have a good start, and solid ground under us; we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> reputation; our business organization is practical, sound and well-devised; our publications are of a respect-worthy character and of a money-breeding species. Now then I think that the association with us of some one of great name and with capital would give our business a prodigious impetus--that phrase is not too strong.|$|E
60|$|This last {{cause of}} the number of sitting days your Committee {{considers}} as far more important than all the rest. The questions upon the admissibility of evidence, the manner in which these questions were stated and were decided, the modes of proceeding, the great uncertainty of the principle upon which evidence in that court is to be admitted or rejected,--all these appear to your Committee materially to affect the constitution of the House of Peers as a court of judicature, as well as its powers, and the purposes it was intended to answer in the state. The Peers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> interest in the conservation of their own lawful privileges. But this interest is not confined to the Lords. The Commons ought to partake in the advantage of the judicial rights and privileges of that high court. Courts are made for the suitors, and not the suitors for the court. The conservation of all other parts of the law, the whole indeed of the rights and liberties of the subject, ultimately depends upon the preservation of the Law of Parliament in its original force and authority.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was perhaps}} amazed at my assurance, but I was {{surprised}} at hers; at her having the energy, in her state of health and at her time of life, to wish to sport with me that way simply for her private entertainment--the humor to test me and practice on me. This, at least, was the interpretation that I put upon her production of the portrait, for I {{could not believe that}} she really desired to sell it or cared for any information I might give her. What she wished was to dangle it before my eyes and put a prohibitive price on it. [...] "The face comes back to me, it torments me," [...] I said, turning the object this way and that and looking at it very critically. It was a careful but not a supreme work of art, larger than the ordinary miniature and representing {{a young man with a}} remarkably handsome face, in a high-collared green coat and a buff waistcoat. I judged the picture to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>valuable</b> quality of resemblance and to have been painted when the model was about twenty-five years old. There are, as all the world knows, three other portraits of the poet in existence, but none of them is of so early a date as this elegant production. [...] "I have never seen the original but I have seen other likenesses," [...] I went on. [...] "You expressed doubt of this generation having heard of the gentleman, but he strikes me for all the world as a celebrity. Now who is he? I can't put my finger on him--I can't give him a label. Wasn't he a writer? Surely he's a poet." [...] I was determined that it should be she, not I, who should first pronounce Jeffrey Aspern's name.|$|E
