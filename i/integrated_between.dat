They are both [...] "steel baskets" [...] or [...] "cages" [...] constructed {{with a special}} structural steel known as [...] "architecturally exposed structural steel". For each pod, six steel arches were welded together, mounted with ball-and-socket rods and reinforced with steel bridges connecting each to a building floor, {{eliminating the need for}} shoring. They are both suspended with steel hangers (10 in total) held in place with a ring truss system. The truss system is integrated into the physical sixth floor, which was made of structural steel to provide the necessary support and is also supported by the steel framing integrated into the windows. Finally, a 19.2metre, 50 tonne transfer truss was <b>integrated</b> <b>between</b> the 6th and 7th floors to provide maximal support.|$|E

40|$|International audienceDue to the {{heterogeneity}} nature of embedded systems, visualizing them from different perspectives requires including different data sets about the underlying system. This opens {{the doors to}} think about <b>integrating</b> <b>between</b> the spatial and the non-spatial data sets in this domain. In this work, we present the SceneMan (Scene Manager) platform that <b>integrates</b> <b>between</b> the different data sets using a 2 Dplus 3 D style to reflect the system from different perspectives. In this context, we visualize the non-spatial data using the normal 2 D representation, which {{can be converted to}} a 3 D representation in some cases such that the stereoscopic depth cue is used to encode some aspects about this data set. Additionally, we visualize the spatial data using 3 D visualization techniques.

However, at high {{concentrations of}} macromolecules, structural correlation effects in the macromolecular liquid become important. Additionally, the repulsive interaction strength strongly increases for large values of [...] (large radius/small radius). In order to account for these issues, the Derjaguin approximation, which is valid for any type of force law, {{has been applied to}} depletion forces. The Derjaguin approximation relates the force between two spheres to the force between two plates. The force is then <b>integrated</b> <b>between</b> small regions on one surface and the opposite surface, which is assumed to be locally flat.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} find {{the effect of a}} {{distributed}} load, the designer can integrate an influence line, found using a point load, over the affected distance of the structure. For example, if a three-foot-long track acts between 5 feet and 8 feet along a beam, the influence line of that beam must be <b>integrated</b> <b>between</b> 5 and 8 feet. The integration of the influence line gives the effect that would be felt if the distributed load had a unit magnitude. Therefore, after integrating, the designer must still scale the results to get the actual effect of the distributed load.|$|E
