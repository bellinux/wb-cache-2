5|$|The final victim, {{killed on}} 31 October 1828, was Margaret Docherty, a middle-aged Irish woman. Burke lured {{her into the}} Broggan lodging house by {{claiming}} {{that his mother was}} also a Docherty from the same area of Ireland, and the pair began drinking. At one point Burke left Docherty in the company of Helen McDougal while he went out, ostensibly to buy more whisky, but actually to get Hare. Two other lodgers—Ann and James Gray—were an inconvenience to the men, so they paid them to stay at Hare's lodging for the night, claiming Docherty was a relative. The drinking continued into the evening, by which time Margaret Hare had joined in. At around 9:00pm the Grays returned briefly to collect some clothing for their children, and saw Burke, Hare, their wives and Docherty all drunk, singing and dancing. Although Burke and Hare came to blows {{at some point in the}} evening, they subsequently murdered Docherty, and put her body in a pile of straw at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E

500|$|A curtain sack, {{commonly}} found on beds of the period, {{hangs in the}} central axis between Gabriel and the attendant angel. [...] A sideboard beside the bed contains two types of candles and a flask of water standing in bright light falling from {{the window to the}} left. The floor is multi-colored tile-work, similar to van der Weyden's Columba altarpiece; Memling truncates the ceiling rafters in the mid-ground, at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> with the floor extending into the foreground. Blum describes the effect as acting [...] "like an open stage for the holy figures".|$|E
50|$|Capillaries do not {{function}} on their own, but instead in a capillary bed, an interweaving network of capillaries supplying organs and tissues. The more metabolically active a cell or environment is, the more capillaries {{are required to}} supply nutrients and carry away waste products. Capillary beds can consist of two types of vessels: true capillaries, which branch from arterioles and provide exchange between cells and the blood, and short vessels that directly connect the arterioles and venules at opposite <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>beds,</b> metarterioles, only found in the mesenteric circulation.|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} and exit lanes inside the wharf compound {{are separated by}} a concrete-bordered garden bed. A flagpole base is present behind the entrance wall at <b>the</b> western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden <b>bed.</b>|$|R

500|$|Dream Days at the Hotel Existence's cover art was {{designed}} by Aaron Hayward & David Homer of Debaser, a New South Wales-based design organisation. The recipient of the 2007 ARIA Award for [...] "Best Cover Art", the album art features {{a photograph of a}} road leading into the Australian outback horizon. In the centre, placed in the sky in relation to the background, there is a window with a crimson curtain. Within this window is a hotel room, as per the name of the album, in which a man with no head in a suit is seated at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> while watching the television.|$|E

40|$|The Mogul {{fault is}} a strand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Texas lineament. The Margaret Wash section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fault is 27 air-line miles {{north-northeast}} <b>of</b> Tucson near <b>the</b> north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Santa Catalina Mountains 0 Attitudes were measured on bedding and foliation {{in a long}} narrow belt of Pinal schist {{which has been in}} part deformed by movements on the Mogul fault. At <b>the</b> east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> belt <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> strikes northeast and dips northwest, however, at <b>the</b> west <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> belt <b>bedding</b> and gneissic foliation strike west-northwest and dip south- southwest. The writer interprets <b>the</b> internal structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pinal schist as reflecting left lateral strike slip in a fault zone which includes <b>the</b> west <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> schist belt but lies to <b>the</b> north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east <b>end.</b> The age and amount of strike slip are unknown. Later normal faulting which is probably Cenozoic cuts obliquely (more northwest) across the strike slip oriented schist. The normal fault dips steeply to the south and the maximum dip slip is probably a few hundred feet...|$|R
50|$|This disused {{clay pit}} exposes a section {{from the late}} Jurassic Kimmeridgian and Tithonian stages, between about 157 and 145 million years ago. It is <b>the</b> only {{exposure}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> northern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Portland <b>Beds,</b> and shows <b>the</b> relationship between <b>the</b> <b>Beds</b> and <b>the</b> Hartwell Clay. It also gives evidence of a period of erosion followed by a rise in sea level.|$|R
500|$|Interest in {{restoring}} the canal began in 1972, and navigation was {{restored to the}} first [...] with <b>the</b> re-opening <b>of</b> Lower Kyme lock in 1986. The Sleaford Navigation Trust has been working towards restoring the whole waterway, and succeeded in purchasing <b>the</b> Sleaford <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river <b>bed</b> in 2004. A short section at Sleaford was opened in 2010, following <b>the</b> installation <b>of</b> a lift bridge.|$|R

60|$|They {{always put}} the pillows at the {{opposite}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> from the gas-burner, so that while you read and smoke before sleeping (as is the ancient and honored custom of bachelors), you have to hold your book aloft, in an uncomfortable position, to keep the light from dazzling your eyes.|$|E
5000|$|Nieuwesteeg Heritage Rose Garden in Maddingley Park, Bacchus Marsh, Victoria has ‘Lady Woodward’.

60|$|For {{once every}} man was satisfied, {{and it was}} agreed that it was the richest place which had been {{discovered}} in California. But though all were doing well, their finds did not approach those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> party at <b>the</b> head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley. The spot on which these were at work was indeed a natural trap for gold. At <b>the</b> lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> claim <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> rock was found at <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> three feet only; but it sloped rapidly down to <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fall, and here an iron rod had been driven down and showed it to be forty feet below the surface.|$|R
50|$|The whole bunches {{are placed}} within a {{designated}} 50 to 70 hl gal tubs, in which after producing a vacuum of air is blown CO2 at 30 degrees Celsius for 7-14 days. The clusters that {{are located on}} <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tanks are crushed by <b>the</b> mass <b>of</b> grapes and release the juice. Yeasts indigenous to the pulp from the peel migrate in search of oxygen and water, triggering a process of intracellular fermentation. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle, <b>the</b> <b>'red</b> wine' is slightly crushed and further fermented for 3-4 days. The minimum alcohol content is 11%, the deadline for bottling is 31 December <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same vintage year.|$|R
60|$|He paused. Mrs. Gould's face, {{very white}} within {{the shadow of}} the hood, bent over him with an invincible and dreary sadness. And the low sobs of Giselle Viola, {{kneeling}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> her gold hair with coppery gleams loose and scattered over the Capataz's feet, hardly troubled the silence of the room.|$|E
60|$|When {{they find}} the pillows removed to the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> in the morning, they receive not the {{suggestion}} in a friendly spirit; but, glorying in their absolute sovereignty, and unpitying your helplessness, they make the bed {{just as it was}} originally, and gloat in secret over the pang their tyranny will cause you.|$|E
6000|$|She {{was in a}} {{state of}} great excitement, and the muscles of her arms were {{twitching}} nervously. It was evident that she was only waiting for the door to shut to tell Rachel all about it. Indeed, directly they were inside her room, she sat on the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and said, [...] "I suppose you think I'm mad?" ...|$|E
50|$|Zone 2 is <b>the</b> part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lungs about 3 cm {{above the}} heart. In this region blood flows in pulses. At first {{there is no}} flow because <b>of</b> {{obstruction}} at <b>the</b> venous <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> capillary <b>bed.</b> Pressure from <b>the</b> arterial side builds up until it exceeds alveolar pressure and flow resumes. This dissipates the capillary pressure and returns to <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cycle. Flow here is sometimes compared to a starling resistor or waterfall effect.|$|R
50|$|In 1994, AME {{developed}} a cost-effective pivot saw with {{the brand name}} AMSAW 200 for the US market. In 2011, AME of Rockford, IL, {{developed a}} high-efficiency carbide saw where <b>the</b> pivot axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gearbox is fixed on <b>the</b> lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machine <b>bed,</b> for cutting 350 mm (14 inch) billets. The force is contained in a close loop and the machine is extremely stiff. In this machine the chip flow is also improved, as the chips are thrown directly onto the chip conveyor.|$|R
60|$|On and on they walked, and {{it seemed}} that <b>the</b> great carpet <b>of</b> deadly flowers that {{surrounded}} them would never end. They followed <b>the</b> bend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> river, and at last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies.

'Wendy,' he continued, in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, 'Wendy, one girl is more use than twenty boys.' ...|$|E

60|$|They {{were playing}} hide-and-seek with bicycle lamps after tea. Dan had hung his lamp on the apple tree at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{hellebore}} <b>bed</b> in <b>the</b> walled garden, and was crouched by the gooseberry bushes ready to dash off when Una should spy him.

50|$|At several sites, {{guardian}} stones {{have been}} so arranged that the corner blocks jut out at an angle from <b>the</b> phalanx <b>of</b> stones.

50|$|<b>The</b> section <b>of</b> {{line between}} Egginton Junction and Friargate was then {{acquired}} by the Train Control Group <b>of</b> <b>the</b> BR Research Division, as a suitable test track.

Thereafter the line {{was used as a}} test track until 1990 when the A516 feeder road to the A50 by-pass was built over the trackbed and the line was closed and lifted.|$|R
60|$|But {{all night}} long the heroes of the past flocked about me. I had been reading a lot of history, and I knew them all the minute my eyes fell upon them. Charlemagne and Canute sat on the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> while Alfred the Great climbed {{up one of the}} posts until he was stopped by Hannibal's legs, who had them twisted about the post to keep himself steady. When I got up in the morning I went down-stairs into the little parlor, and there was the maid down on her knees {{cleaning}} the hearth.|$|E
60|$|The latter's heavy, {{white face}} had {{appeared}} to me when I looked upon it the evening before to express nothing but stupidity and terror. Now, on the contrary, every feature bespoke brutality and ferocity. Never have I seen a more dreadful-looking villain. In his hand he held a long, dull-coloured knife. The Abbot, on the other hand, was as polished and as dignified as ever. His Capuchin gown had been thrown open, however, and I saw beneath it a black, frogged coat, such as I have seen among the English officers. As our eyes met he leaned over the wooden <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> and laughed silently until it creaked again.|$|E
60|$|About {{the middle}} of the night Liza woke; her mouth was hot and dry, and a sharp, cutting pain passed through her head as she moved. Her mother had evidently roused herself, for she was lying in bed by her side, {{partially}} undressed, with all the bedclothes rolled round her. Liza shivered in the cold night, and taking off some of her things--her boots, her skirt, and jacket--got right into bed; she tried to get some of the blanket from her mother, but as she pulled Mrs. Kemp gave a growl in her sleep and drew the clothes more tightly round her. So Liza put over herself her skirt and a shawl, which was lying over the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bed,</b> and tried to go to sleep.|$|E
50|$|In 1969, <b>the</b> {{initial phase}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower Monumental Dam was {{completed}} nearby, bringing more electricity and water for irrigation, but inundating the nearby Marmes Rockshelter. The dam {{also made the}} Snake River navigable, allowing grain to be barged downriver rather than being carried by train. Within a few years, the railroad through <b>the</b> north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valley was abandoned and removed.
