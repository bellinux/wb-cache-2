25|$|Note {{that most}} modern Germanic {{languages}} have {{lost most of}} the inherited inflectional morphology {{as a result of}} the steady attrition of unstressed endings triggered by the strong <b>initial</b> <b>stress.</b> (Contrast, for example, the Balto-Slavic languages, which have largely kept the Indo-European pitch accent and consequently preserved much of the inherited morphology.) Icelandic and to a lesser extent modern German best preserve the Proto–Germanic inflectional system, with four noun cases, three genders, and well-marked verbs.

2500|$|The {{theory of}} the {{behavior}} of columns was investigated in 1757 by mathematician Leonhard Euler. He derived the formula, the Euler formula, that gives the maximum axial load that a long, slender, ideal column can carry without buckling. An ideal column is one that is perfectly straight, made of a homogeneous material, and free from <b>initial</b> <b>stress.</b> When the applied load reaches the Euler load, sometimes called the critical load, the column comes to be in a state of unstable equilibrium. At that load, the introduction of the slightest lateral force will cause the column to fail by suddenly [...] "jumping" [...] to a new configuration, and the column is said to have buckled. This is what happens when a person stands on an empty aluminum can and then taps the sides briefly, causing it to then become instantly crushed (the vertical sides of the can understood as an infinite series of extremely thin columns). The formula derived by Euler for long slender columns is given below.|$|E

We have shown analytically that reflection and transmission coefficients of (qP) and (qSV) waves depend upon the angle of incidence, the parameters of electric potential, the material constants of the medium as will as the <b>initial</b> <b>stresses</b> presented in the media. The numerical calculations of the reflection and transmission amplitude ratios for different values of <b>initial</b> <b>stresses</b> have been carried out by computer for different materials as examples and the results are given in the form of graphs.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{problem of}} {{transverse}} low-velocity {{impact on a}} linearly in-plane prestressed sandwich panel has been considered in this article. The panel may be subjected to initial in-plane biaxial normal and shear stresses {{along the edges of}} the panel. Impact is assumed to occur normally over the top or the bottom face-sheets, at arbitrary location. The boundary conditions of the top and the bottom face-sheets are independent. The interaction between the impactor and the panel is modeled {{with the help of the}} system having three-degrees-of-freedom (TDOF) consisting of springs–masses–dashpot (SMD) or springs–masses (SM). The effects of <b>initial</b> biaxial <b>stresses</b> and transverse flexibility of the core are considered analytically. In order to determine all components of the displacements, stresses and strains in the face-sheets and the core, a numerical procedure based on improved higher-order sandwich plate theory (IHSAPT) and Galerkin’s method, are employed. The deflections and the corresponding stresses in the panel with higher <b>initial</b> <b>stresses</b> are smaller than those with lower <b>initial</b> <b>stresses.</b> The effects of in-plane <b>initial</b> shear <b>stresses</b> on impact response are slightly greater than that of the other in-plane normal loading states...|$|R
