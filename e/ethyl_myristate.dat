50|$|In {{contrast}} to other drugs consumed, alcohol is deposited {{directly in the}} hair. For this reason the investigation procedure looks for direct products of ethanol metabolism. The main part of alcohol is oxidized in the human body. This means it is released as water and carbon dioxide. One part of the alcohol reacts with fatty acids to produce esters. The sum of the concentrations of four of these fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs: <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate) are used as indicators of the alcohol consumption. The amounts found in hair are measured in nanograms (one nanogram equals only one billionth of a gram), however {{with the benefit of}} modern technology, it is possible to detect such small amounts. In the detection of ethyl glucuronide, or EtG, testing can detect amounts in picograms (one picogram equals 0.001 nanograms).|$|E

40|$|Fatty {{acid esters}} {{have a wide}} range of {{applications}} in various chemical industries, such as pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food and, most recently, in the biodiesel production. Being able to predict the phase equilibria at reduced pressures of systems composed either only of fatty acid esters as well as also of their mixtures with alcohols, is of major relevance for the design, optimization and operation of industrial facilities producing these compounds, or their use as fuels. In the present work, the Cubic-Plus-Association Equation of State (CPA EoS) was applied to predict the isobaric vapor-liquid equilibria of six binary systems composed of ethyl/methyl fatty acid esters from laurate to linoleate in the pressure range 0. 5 - 13. 3 kPa, and the isothermal phase equilibria of the binary systems tetradecane + <b>ethyl</b> caproate/ethyl <b>myristate</b> at temperatures from 373. 15 to 453. 15 K. The predictive ability of the CPA EoS was further evaluated in the description of multicomponent biodiesel systems with associating compounds.

40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} {{of a family of}} gelators in which alkyl chains are connected to the amino groups of L-lysine methyl ester using a range of different hydrogen bonding linking groups (carbamate, amide, urea, thiourea and diacylhydrazine) using simple synthetic methodology based on isocyanate or acid chloride chemistry. The ability of these compounds to gelate organic solvents such as toluene or cyclohexane can be directly related to the ability of the linking group to form intermolecular hydrogen bonds. In general terms, the ability to structure solvents can be considered as: thiourea <carbamate <amide <urea similar to diacylhydrazine. This process has been confirmed by thermal measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared and circular dichroism spectroscopies. By deprotecting the methyl ester group, we have demonstrated that a balance between hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups is essential-if the system has too much hydrophilicity (e. g., diacylhydrazine, urea) it will not form gels due to low solubility in the organic media. However, the less effective gelators based on amide and carbamate linkages are enhanced by converting the methyl ester to a carboxylic acid. Furthermore, subsequent mixing of the acid with a second component (diaminododecane) further enhances the ability to form networks, and, {{in the case of the}} amide, generates a two-component gel, which can immobilise a wide range of solvents of industrial interest including petrol and diesel (fuel oils), olive oil and sunflower oil (renewable food oils) and <b>ethyl</b> laurate, isopropyl <b>myristate</b> and isopropyl palmitate (oils used in pharmaceutical formulation).

The de-termination of FAEE in hair can help to evaluate social and excessive alcohol consumption. Due {{to the presence of}} FAEE in the hair of teeto-talers, proving alcohol abstinence seems to be impossible. To verify these results, an solid phase micro extraction-gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry procedure for the determination of the four FAEE: <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate in hair was validated with special focus on low concentration levels. Besides very high sensitivity (limits of detection between 0. 005 and 0. 009 ng/ mg), good results for linearity, precision and accuracy, recovery and stability were achieved. In addition, 73 hair samples with measured ethyl glucuronide (EtG) concentrations between 4 and 10 pg/mg were analyzed for FAEE. By using the following cut-offs: EtG: 7 pg/mg, FAEE: 0. 2 ng/mg a satisfying matching rate of 72. 6 % was found. This shows that FAEE can be determined to verify borderline EtG concentra-tions even in the context of abstinence tests.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to determine whether FAEE incorporation is affected by hair pigmentation. Methods: Black hooded LE rats were injected intraperitoneally daily with ethanol. Prior to dosing, black and white patches of fur were shaved and analyzed for baseline levels of FAEE using an adapted extraction procedure and GCMS method. Once the shaved ‘patches’ had grown back they were re-sampled along with hair outside the ‘patches’, referred to as ‘no patch ’ hair, and tested for post-treatment FAEE levels in the same manner. Blood was also sampled for pharmacokinetic analysis of ethanol. Results: Total FAEE levels were significantly higher in post-treatment hair (black and white) compared to baseline (pre-treatment) levels. Total FAEE levels were also significantly higher in post-treatment ‘patch ’ hair (black and white) compared to ‘no patch ’ hair. No {{significant differences were found between}} post-treatment black and white hair. The FAEE profiles were similar between black and white hair, with FAEE levels being highest for <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> followed by ethyl stearate, palmitate, and then oleate. Conclusion: FAEE incorporation into hair does not appear to be affected by hair pigment, which is in congruence with what is known about the chemistry of drug–melanin interactions.

After 12  h methanol induction, {{formation of}} volatile compounds was assessed by SPME GC–MS analysis. Phenethyl alcohol was detected from all the cell cultures, indicating this compound is an endogenous metabolite derived from P. pastoris yeast itself from wort medium used. Apart from phenethyl alcohol, none of volatile ester compounds was observed from the control strain. For the recombinant strains, production of ethyl esters was observed to increase with the increasing chain length from C 6 to C 10. As shown in Fig.  2, recombinant yeast P. pastoris-EHT 1 produced fatty acid ethyl esters including ethyl hexanoate (C 6), ethyl octanoate (C 8) and ethyl decanoate (C 10), corresponding to 2, 10 and 11  % of total volatiles, respectively. Similarly, during fermentation with the P. pastoris-EEB 1, the levels were 1, 7 and 13  % of total volatiles for ethyl hexanoate (C 6), ethyl octanoate (C 8) and ethyl decanoate (C 10), respectively. In addition, {{it is interesting to}} note that ethyl laurate (C 12) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate</b> (C 14) were produced by P. pastoris-EHT 1, but not by P. pastoris-EEB 1, although they were only present in relatively small quantities. It should be noted that the value above was expressed in relative abundance of the gas phase, and an overall quantification of these compounds indicated that P. pastoris-EEB 1 produced higher amounts of esters compared to P. pastoris-EHT 1 expect for ethyl hexanoate (see Additional file 3), probably due to higher expression level of yeast enzyme Eeb 1 extracellularly.|$|E
40|$|The {{forensic}} {{utility of}} fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in dried blood spots (DBS) as short-term confirmatory markers for ethanol intake was examined. An LC-MS/MS method for {{the determination of}} FAEEs in DBS was developed and validated to investigate FAEE formation and elimination in a drinking study, whereby eight subjects ingested 0. 66 - 0. 84  g/kg alcohol to reach blood alcohol concentrations (BAC) of 0. 8  g/kg. Blood was taken every 1. 5 - 2  h, BAC was determined, and dried blood spots were prepared, with 50  μL of blood, for the determination of FAEEs. Lower limits of quantitation (LLOQ) were between 15 and 37  ng/mL for the four major FAEEs. Validation data are presented in detail. In the drinking study, ethyl palmitate and ethyl oleate {{proved to be the}} two most suitable markers for FAEE determination. Maximum FAEE concentrations were reached in samples taken 2 or 4  h after the start of drinking. The following mean peak concentrations (c̅ max) were reached: <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate</b> 14 [*]±[*] 4  ng/mL, ethyl palmitate 144 [*]±[*] 35  ng/mL, ethyl oleate 125 [*]±[*] 55  ng/mL, ethyl stearate 71 [*]±[*] 21  ng/mL, total FAEEs 344 [*]±[*] 91  ng/mL.

40|$|The {{consensus}} on alcohol markers in hair was revised {{for the fourth}} time by an expert group of the Society of Hair Testing based on current state of research. This revision was adopted by the members of the Society during the business meeting in Brisbane on August 29 th 2016. For both markers, ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), two cut-off values for discrimination between teetotalers or occasional low amount consumption and moderate alcohol drinking (low cut-off), and between non-excessive (abstinence up to moderate alcohol intake) and chronic excessive drinking (high cut-off value) were critically examined. For the current revision, the cut-off values for EtG (7 pg/mg and 30 pg/mg, respectively) remained unchanged despite different findings or discussions published in the meantime. This was mainly {{due to the lack of}} broader data collections from new studies with great numbers of volunteers following thorough study concepts. In contrast, an essential change of the consensus was accepted for the FAEEs, where the concentration of ethyl palmitate (E 16 : 0) can be used autonomously for interpretation instead of the concentration sum (ΣFAEE) of the four esters <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate, as previously applied. After evaluation of the data from seven laboratories, the E 16 : 0 cut-off for abstinence assessment was defined at 0. 12 ng/mg for the 0 - 3 cm segment and at 0. 15 ng/mg for the 0 - 6 cm segment. The cut-off for chronic excessive drinking was fixed at 0. 35 ng/mg for the 0 - 3 cm segment and at 0. 45 ng/mg for the 0 - 6 cm segment. The use of E 16 : 0 with these cut-offs in place of ΣFAEE for alcohol intake assessment produces only a minor loss in discrimination power, leads to no essential difference in the interpretation concerning chronic excessive alcohol consumption and is suitable to confirm EtG results in abstinence assessment if ethanol containing hair sprays or lotions are excluded...|$|E
40|$|Alcohol {{abuse and}} its {{consequences}} such as severe illnesses, accidents or violence are major problems in western societies. Therefore, reliable and accurate biomarkers are required to objectively monitor alcohol consumption. The aim of this research project was to validate analytical methods for the determination of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) and ethyl glucuronide (EtG) as long term alcohol abuse markers. Both markers are minor metabolites which are released during non-oxidative alcohol metabolism. Hair and meconium were identified as suitable analytical matrices that provide a large time frame. Hair samples from 3350 test persons and meconium samples from 724 cases were analyzed in total. Methods to detect these markers in hair and meconium were validated according to the guidelines of the German Society of Forensic Toxicologists (GTFCh). The applicability of these methods was demonstrated in real cases. Liquid extraction from hair or meconium was performed to determine the FAEEs. This was followed by headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gaschromatography mass spectrometry. Linearity was shown for the calibration ranges from 0. 05 ng/mg to 0. 50 ng/mg (for the single FAEEs) and from 0. 50 ng/mg up to 5. 0 ng/mg. A high range and a low range calibration were applied because the calibration curve was slightly bent due to saturation effects. The limits of detection (LODs) and the lower limits of quantification (LLOQ) were estimated for <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate</b> (LOD: 9 pg/mg; LLOQ: 13 pg/mg), ethyl palmitate (LOD: 9 pg/mg; LLOQ: 19 pg/mg), ethyl oleate (LOD: 14 pg/mg; LLOQ: 31 pg/mg) and ethyl stearate (LOD: 4 pg/mg; LLOQ: 11 pg/mg). The method used to quantify FAEEs in meconium showed linearity for the calibration range from 0. 05 ng/mg to 10. 0 ng/mg (for the single FAEEs). A calibration range from 0. 10 ng/mg to 10. 0 ng/mg was applied only to ethyl linolenate. The curves of <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> ethyl palmitate, ethyl linoleate and ethyl linolenate were weighted using a factor of 1 /x²; weighting was not nessecary for ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate. The limits of detection and the lower limits of quantification were estimated for <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate</b> (LOD: 8 pg/mg; LLOQ: 21 pg/mg), ethyl palmitate (LOD: 7 pg/mg; LLOQ: 17 pg/mg), ethyl oleate (LOD: 6 pg/mg; LLOQ: 19 pg/mg), ethyl linoleate (LOD: 18 pg/mg; LLOQ: 36 pg/mg), ethyl linolenate (LOD: 13 pg/mg; LLOQ: 44 pg/mg) and ethyl stearate (LOD: 3 pg/mg; LLOQ: 10 pg/mg). Following liquid extraction from hair or meconium, ethyl glucuronide was measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A linear calibration ranging from 7 pg/mg up to 5000 pg/mg was applied in the detection of EtG in hair. A linear calibration curve from 30 pg/mg to 80000 pg/mg was used in order to quantify EtG in meconium. The calibration functions were weighted with the factor 1 /x². The LOD and LLOQ in hair were 2 pg/mg and 7 pg/mg, respectively. In meconium, a LOD of 10 pg/mg and a LLOQ of 30 pg/mg were estimated. In addition to the analytical validation a clinical validation of these markers and their performances were considered important. Reliable cut-off values for the differentiation between social drinking and chronic excessive drinking should be investigated. The estimation of suitable reference ranges and cut-offs for biomarkers, used {{for the detection of}} pathological processes, is difficult. Data on reference ranges, the correlation between alcohol intake and marker concentration in hair or meconium, the covered time frame, influence values which may lead to a misinterpretation as well as data on sensitivity and specificity can only be generated indirectly. Test persons cannot participate in studies which include the systematic intake of harmful amounts of alcohol. Therefore, the data was generated from real cases (n = 4074). Reliable information on drinking habits, drinking amounts, hair cosmetics, the general health status and general parameters such as body weight, height, gender and hair color were necessarily considered. Extensive investigations on the hair test for alcohol markers were conducted and detailed results regarding method performances as well as a suggestion for optimized cut-offs were obtained. The areas under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC curve AUCs) in the determination of FAEEs in hair were, according to the study design, 0. 745, 0. 828 and 0. 955. For ethyl glucuronide in hair, ROC curve AUCs of 0. 941 and 0. 954 respectively were recorded. The cut-off values for FAEEs optimized according to the presented data were higher than the actual cut-offs proposed by the Society of Hair Testing (SoHT). Depending on the population and depending on the availability of data on hair cosmetic treatment the cut-off should be raised to a value between 0. 70 ng/mg and 1. 00 ng/mg. The sensitivities were estimated between 56 % and 77 % with specificities between 80 % and 96 %. The optimized cut-off values for EtG were calculated as 28 pg/mg or 30 pg/mg respectively, which is in accordance with the proposal of the SoHT. Depending on the study design the sensitivities were between 75 % and 83 % with a specificity of 97 % in both cases. The results of the presented studies indicate that ethyl glucuronide in hair is a better marker for detecting alcohol abuse when compared to FAEEs in hair. Nevertheless, it was demonstrated that the combined interpretation of both markers leads to a decreased number of false-positive and false-negative results. In addition, hair FAEEs and hair EtG were compared to the traditional alcohol markers carbohydrate deficient transferring (CDT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), mean corpuscular volume of the erythrocytes (MCV), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) which are measured using blood samples. In general, {{it was found that the}} hair analysis was more accurate than the traditional alcohol markers. Main advantages were the wider time frame that was covered, especially when EtG and FAEEs are interpreted in combination, a higher sensitivity and specificity was reported. However, markers such as CDT and GGT may be more cost-effective in some cases. Their values rose only after long-term alcohol abuse when significant organ damages became apparent and in most cases receded to their reference range within 2 or 3 weeks of alcohol abstinence. The application of hair analysis of alcohol markers for a variety of situations, such as workplace drug testing, driving ability examination, death cases and family courts was tested and pitfalls and advantages were described. Methods for the detection of ethyl glucuronide and fatty acid ethyl esters in meconium were validated according to forensic guidelines. A baseline study including 602 cases was undertaken to estimate a reference range for the alcohol marker concentrations and for this population the alcohol marker concentration in meconium was measured to estimate a “normal” value. A confident cut-off value could not be obtained, but, as a first step, a reference range was roughly estimated. A cut-off of 0. 50 ng/mg for FAEEs and 274 pg/mg for EtG was applied. In conclusion, the results of this work demonstrate and confirm the applicability of ethyl glucuronide and fatty acid ethyl esters as long-term alcohol abuse markers...|$|E

In a study with 87 test persons sebum samples were collected from the forehead by the use of Sebutapes (CuDerm) and analyzed of FAEEs. The cumulative concentration of the four esters <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> ethyl palmitate, ethyl oleate and ethyl stearate were on 52 alcoholics 11, 3 to 857 ng (mean 84, 3 ng), on 20 social-drinkers 13, 9 – 271 ng (mean 48, 0 ng) and on 15 non-drinkers 3, 6 – 32, 0 ng (mean 16, 0 ng) per Sebutape. The cut-off was 30 ng per patch to discrimination of chronic alcohol abuse. Sensitivity and specificity was 77 %. The results correlate with FAEEs in hair and carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT). 78 hair samples from employees in sensitive jobs were tested for FAEEs and EtG and additional compared with traditional alcohol markers. In 50 cases no indications of alcohol abuse were obtained. In 13 cases slight indications and in 11 cases clear indications were seen. The traditional markers confirmed the hair results only partly. The results of both markers were different in four cases. Both Markers in hair are suitable for application in workplace alcohol testing programs especially when interpreted in combination. For detection alcohol consumption during pregnancy 122 meconium samples from newborns off a drug-using population were collected and analyzed of FAEEs and also tested for common drugs of abuse. In 89 drugs were found. In 25 cases the levels of FAEEs indicating significant alcohol consumption. The cut-off was 0, 5 ng/mg meconium. The method provide an assessment off children suffer due to alcohol consumption by the mother. 1057 autopsy cases were examined for the estimation of an applicable cut-off value. The optimum cut-off value for differentiation between chronic excessive drinking and social drinking was 1, 08 ng/mg hair. Sensitivity was 56 % and specificity was 80 %. The method is suitable for the postmortem detection of chronic excessive drinking. Over 169 patients in clinical alcohol withdrawal, social drinkers and teetotalers EtG and FAEEs in hair were compared to traditional biomarkers for alcohol consumption. The study showed good correlations between the both markers in hair and the traditional biomarkers with the best specificity. The studies showed consistently that EtG and FAEEs in hair, sebum and meconium are applicable as markers for alcohol consumption. The validity is the same as traditional markers. The advantages of both markers in hair are the postmortem analysis, the higher values of specificity and the long term evidence to alcohol consumption...|$|E
40|$|Mushrooms {{have been}} valued {{throughout}} the world as both food and medicine for thousands of years. Pleurotus sajor-caju has become attractive as functional food {{and a source of}} physiologically beneficial substances. These functional characteristics are mainly due to their chemical composition thus the chemical compositions of P. sajor-caju were investigated in this study. Twenty-seven compounds have been separated and identified from the EAE and BE extracts of P. sajor-caju. EAE comprised of three methyl esters namely, methyl palmitate, methyl stearate and methyl linoleate, five hydrocarbon fatty acids namely, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid, myristic acid and linoleic acid, a phenolic compound identified as 2, 4 -ditertbutylphenol, six ethyl esters, namely <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> ethyl palmitate, ethyl linolenate, ethyl stearate, ethyl linoleate and ethyl oleate and eight sterol compounds namely, lichesterol, 5, 6 -dihydroergosterol, neoergosterol, ergosta- 5, 8 -dien- 3 -ol, 7 -ergostenol, ergosta- 5, 18 (14) -dien- 2 -ol, ergosta- 5 -en- 3 -ol and ergosterol. Cinnamic acid, nicotinamide, benzeneacetamide and 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde were identified in BE extract using GC-MS and NMR analysis. These fractions were then subjected to various antioxidant assays namely β-carotene bleaching, ferric reducing capability, ABTS radical scavenging ability, inhibition of lipid peroxidation and total phenolic content. The AE and BE extracts exhibited the highest antioxidant activities and corresponds to the total phenolic content meanwhile the sub-fractions from the EAE extract (EP 2, EP 3, EP 4 and EP 5), showed moderate antioxidant activity. Hence, P. sajor-caju extracts can be considered as potential dietary antioxidants. Polysaccharide (GE) was isolated and purified using hot-water extraction method. The efficacy of GE on lipid metabolism and glucose homeostasis was evaluated using the in-vitro and in-vivo models. Abstract iii In the in-vitro study using 3 T 3 -L 1 cell line, GE stimulated lipogenesis (lower concentrations) and lipolysis by up-regulating the expression of HSL, ATGL and leptin genes. Furthermore, GE also up-regulated the expression of adiponectin and GLUT- 4 genes, indicates GE is able to enhance the glucose uptake efficiently. Finally, GE attenuated oxidative indices (protein and lipid damages) which may occur during glucose oxidation in 3 T 3 -L 1 cells. In the in-vivo study using C 57 BL/ 6 J (ob/ob) mice fed a high-fat diet, GE treated groups significantly reduced the body weight and this is could be due to the up-regulation of HSL and ATGL genes in the adipose tissue which may have stimulated lipolysis while down-regulation of PPAR-γ, SREBP- 1 c and LPL genes may have decreased the differentiation of adipose tissue. Additionally, GE also improved the glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in the mice by up-regulating the expression of adiponectin and GLUT- 4 genes. GE also attenuated the DNA, protein and lipid damages along with uric acid levels by increasing the enzymic antioxidants (SOD, CAT and GPx) content in the mice. Finally, GE down-regulated the expression of inflammatory markers (IL- 6, TNF-α, SAA 2, CRP and MCP- 1) by inactivating the nuclear transcription factors (NF-κB) hence, the mice in GE treated groups were not insulin resistance and did not develop diabetes. Regular consumption of P. sajor-caju as a part of our diet may render nutritional benefits for preventing obesity and diabetes...|$|E
40|$|Ethanol is {{a poison}} that {{adversely}} affects {{the health of}} individuals and is detrimental to society as a whole. Analysis of ethanol in biological matrices is the most frequent test carried out in forensic toxicology laboratories with application {{across a range of}} cases types including fatalities, road traffic accidents, criminal investigations and workplace drug testing. The interpretation of ethanol concentrations in post mortem samples can be challenging in relation to medico-legal investigations. The source of ethanol can be {{as a result of the}} ingestion of an alcoholic beverage or it may have been formed after death. The stability of alcohol is also adversely affected by the presence of bacteria, high temperatures and unsuitable storage containers. A robust and sensitive method was developed for the analysis of common volatiles such as ethanol, methanol, isopropanol, acetone and n-propanol using headspace gas chromatography coupled with a flame ionization detector (HS-GC-FID). The method was validated in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025, and was used to investigate the stability of volatiles in blood when stored under different conditions, and to investigate the prevalence of volatiles in different biological matrices collected post-mortem. Storage of blood samples in the freezer within sample vials containing preservative and antioxidant improved the stability of all volatiles with the exception of methanol which remained stable under all conditions investigated. The identification of ethanol or acetone in vitreous humour was found to be a suitable alternative matrix in cases where femoral blood was unavailable or ethanol production was suspected. The concentration of ethanol in bile correlated well with femoral blood but to a lesser extent than vitreous humour. Urine was not a suitable matrix for estimating blood ethanol concentrations. Alcohol biomarkers, Beta-Hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) have been reported as useful markers for, investigating the role of alcoholic ketoacidosis (AKA) in post-mortem cases, and foetal exposure to chronic maternal alcohol consumption, respectively. Methods were developed and validated in accordance with ISO/IEC 17025 for BHB in blood and urine using gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (GC/MS), and for FAEEs in meconium by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Post-mortem case samples submitted to the Forensic Medicine and Science (FMS) toxicology laboratory for routine tests were analysed for BHB using the validated method. The findings highlighted the importance of measuring BHB in blood in all cases where the deceased has a history of alcohol misuse and where the cause of death cannot be determined following the post-mortem. The role of alcoholic ketoacidosis in the cases analysed in this study was significantly under-reported. Meconium samples collected from infants born at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital, Glasgow, were analysed for FAEEs, using the validated method to investigate the prevalence of each FAEE (ethyl laurate, <b>ethyl</b> <b>myristate,</b> ethyl palmitate, ethyl stearate, ethyl oleate, ethyl linoleate, ethyl linolenate, and ethyl arachidonate). The study found evidence of chronic maternal alcohol consumption in approximately one third of the cases tested, in contrast to self-reported use and highlights the importance of screening for the presence of FAEEs in meconium. The identification of suitable biomarkers of excessive maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy, carried out as part of screening program, in addition to clinical evaluation would help to diagnose and support newborns with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). The method developed for the analysis of BHB in blood and urine was successfully adapted and validated for analysis of structurally similar drugs such as Beta-hydroxy-Beta-methylbutyrate (HMB), a legal dietary supplement, in plasma and urine collected from 8 subjects, pre- and post-administration of a 3 g dose of HMB. A significant increase was observed in urine and plasma following administration of of HMB. The method was then applied to the analysis of post-mortem blood and urine to investigate the concentrations of exogenous and endogenous levels of γ-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) ...|$|E
