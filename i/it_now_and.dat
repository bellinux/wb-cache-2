5|$|Malta's tourism {{industry}} faces {{a number of}} issues impacting on <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> threatening to impact on it in the future. One of the clearest issues facing Malta's {{tourism industry}} is overcrowding {{as a result of the}} island nation's relatively small size, in terms of both area and population. Malta is a nation of just under 450,000 people, yet its infrastructure is required to support over 1.1 million tourists every year. Malta's water works, roads, waste management systems and beaches are stretched to capacity in the summer months of July and August of every year, when tourism numbers are at their peak. This is a challenge facing Maltese tourism operators as it means that they cannot simply pursue the kinds of 'mass tourism' marketing measures taken by operators in other Mediterranean destinations with more space and resources to pursue them. In addition, Maltese tourism operators must balance increased tourism numbers with the needs of the 'native population', as when resources are stretched thin by tourists during the summer season, there are negative impacts on Maltese residents also.|$|E
25|$|The area now {{occupied}} by the Vanderbilt Tennis Club was once a CBS television studio that produced various live and recorded shows such as The CBS Evening News and See <b>It</b> <b>Now,</b> <b>and</b> live dramas, such as Mama. The first four episodes of What's My Line also originated from Grand Central before the show moved to various Manhattan theaters that could accommodate studio audiences. In 1964, CBS moved television operations to the CBS Broadcast Center.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between Paley and his news staff {{was not always}} smooth. His friendship with Edward R. Murrow, {{one of the leading}} lights in the CBS news division (and by then a vice president of CBS), suffered during the 1950s over the hard-hitting tone of the Murrow-hosted See It Now series. The implication was that the network's sponsors were uneasy about some of the controversial topics of the series, leading Paley to worry about lost revenue to the network as well as unwelcome scrutiny during the era of McCarthyism. In 1955, Alcoa withdrew its sponsorship of See <b>It</b> <b>Now,</b> <b>and</b> eventually the program's weekly broadcast on Tuesdays was stopped, though it continued as a series of special segments until 1958.|$|E

6000|$|... "Perhaps it's sympathy, instinct, or {{something}} like that. Anyhow, I do know, and you may feel better when you have told me. <b>It's</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> then a relief to talk about one's troubles." ...|$|R

25|$|There {{is nothing}} solid {{left in the}} Players' Protective Association. There has been no {{activity}} {{on the part of}} the present officials, and there will be none. The organization has been allowed to die because the members have seen nothing in it to interest them. Some are not pleased with the officers; others object to the paying of dues, while others still believe that they can do better by themselves than by acting in concert with all the other players; and so the Players' Protective Association gradually is being allowed to die out. One hears but little of <b>it</b> <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> in a year from now will hear less. It would have been a good thing for the players if they had been true to its principles and the officials had been active in carrying out all its aims and laws. However, there was failure on all sides, and the result is that the organization gradually is fading out of existence.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{favorable}} reviews and good chart {{position of the}} lead single, 1000 Fires did not achieve mainstream success. Lords later commented: [...] "The problem with that album {{was that it was}} ahead of its time. Electronica was just starting to happen. Moby was just starting to be huge. I opened for Thrill Kill Kult and Moby as a DJ back then. The masses didn't know who Moby was. I think if it had been slightly delayed it would have done better. Madonna had it right to wait for Ray of Light. She has been a lot better with her timing than me. I am proud of that album because I hear <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> it still feels current. It doesn't feel dated." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{open-ended}} {{nature of}} the lyrics has led to many interpretations. Journalist Michael Campbell believed the lyrics send [...] "a message of hope" [...] and wish for a [...] "world that is not divided by class, wealth, race, or any other arbitrary criterion". With regard to the place Bono was referring to in the song, he said, [...] "I'm not sure, really, about that. I used {{to think it was}} Belfast..." [...] Journalist Niall Stokes believes the title was influenced by Bono's and his wife Ali's visit to Ethiopia as volunteer aid-workers. Bono has expressed mixed opinions about the open-ended lyrics: [...] "I can look at <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> recognize that [...] {{has one of the most}} banal couplets in the history of pop music. But it also contains some of the biggest ideas. In a curious way, that seems to work. If you get any way heavy about these things, you don't communicate. But if you're flip or throwaway about it, then you do. That's one of the paradoxes I've come to terms with." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Tarantino {{discussed}} an {{idea for}} a type of Spaghetti Western set in the United States' pre-Civil War Deep South. He called this type of film [...] "a southern", stating that he wanted [...] "to do movies that deal with America's horrible past with slavery and stuff but do them like spaghetti westerns, not like big issue movies. I want to do them like they're genre films, but they deal with everything that America has never dealt with because it's ashamed of it, and other countries don't really deal with because they don't feel they have the right to." [...] Tarantino later explained the genesis of the idea: [...] "I was writing a book about Sergio Corbucci when I came {{up with a way to}} tell the story.... I was writing about how his movies have this evil Wild West, a horrible Wild West. It was surreal, it dealt a lot with fascism. So I'm writing this whole piece on this, and I'm thinking: 'I don't really know if Sergio was thinking [...] while he was doing this. But I know I'm thinking <b>it</b> <b>now.</b> <b>And</b> I can do it!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Lady Bird was a shy {{and quiet}} girl who {{spent much of}} her youth alone outdoors. [...] "People always look back at <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> assume it was lonely," [...] she once said about her childhood. [...] "To me it {{definitely}} was not. [...] I {{spent a lot of time}} just walking and fishing and swimming." [...] She developed her lifelong love of the outdoors as a child growing up in the tall pines and bayous of East Texas, where she watched the wildflowers bloom each spring.|$|E

2500|$|Kyle MacLachlan says Dylan McDermott was {{the first}} choice for the {{character}} of Zack Carey, but he declined and MacLachlan was then cast. The actor later recalled, [...] "That was a decision {{that was sort of}} a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly Robocop, which I loved. I look back on <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> it’s a little dated, but it’s still fantastic, and I think it’s got some of the great villains of all time in there. It was Verhoeven and [...] Eszterhas, and it seemed like {{it was going to be}} kind of dark and edgy and disturbing and real." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orbison {{attributed}} his own passion {{during his}} performances {{to the period}} when {{he grew up in}} Fort Worth while the US was mobilizing for World War II. His parents worked in a defense plant and his father would bring a guitar in the evenings and their friends and relatives who had just joined the military would gather, and drink and sing heartily. Orbison later reflected, [...] "I guess that level of intensity made a big impression on me, because it's still there. That sense of 'do it for all it's worth and do <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> do it good.' Not to analyze it too much, but I think the verve and gusto that everybody felt and portrayed around me has stayed with me all this time." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 October 2013, the Saturdays {{announced}} that they would go on tour in early 2014. Mollie King said: [...] "We're already planning <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> it's {{going to be at}} the start of next year. We literally cannot wait". She revealed that Frankie Sandford was missing performing with the band while is on maternity leave and that she was [...] "dying to get back out there". She said that they were excited because they have not been on tour for a long time: [...] "But we actually haven't toured now for over a year, two years!" [...] Rochelle Humes said that the band will not tour until Sandford is back from maternity leave. The Saturdays announce on the Paul O'Grady show in late November 2013 that their tour will only be throughout the UK and Ireland.|$|E

No. So, as far as my {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was the same as that of my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes as I told you. I admit <b>it</b> <b>now</b> <b>and</b> I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 16, 1986, Slippery When Wet was {{released}}. The album reached {{number one}} in U.S., where it spent 8 weeks at {{number one on the}} Billboard 200 album chart. The first two singles from the album, [...] "You Give Love a Bad Name" [...] and [...] "Livin' on a Prayer", both reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Slippery When Wet was named the top selling album of 1987 by Billboard [...] "Livin' On A Prayer" [...] won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance. The band won an award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band at the American Music Awards and an award for Favorite Rock Group at the People's Choice Awards. When Slippery When Wet was released in August 1986, Bon Jovi was the support act for 38 Special. By the end of 1986, Bon Jovi were well into six months of headline dates in arenas across America. In August 1987, the band headlined England's [...] "Monsters of Rock" [...] festival. During their set Dee Snider, Bruce Dickinson and Paul Stanley joined the band to perform [...] "We're an American Band". The band ended the year having headlined 130 shows in the [...] "Tour Without End", grossing $28,400,000. Jon Bon Jovi was asked what this breakthrough to worldwide fame meant, to which he answered, [...] "Everything is bigger, and it moves twice as fast. You're recognized twice as often. This is bigger, the whole world gets bigger. You have to sell more records, be huger. You get smarter and you understand the business a little more, so it's more responsibility. You understand <b>it</b> <b>now,</b> <b>and</b> {{you want to make sure}} everything goes right".|$|E
