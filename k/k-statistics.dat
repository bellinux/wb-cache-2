The goals of this paper are threefold. We first introduce the notion of spectral sampling as an operation on a finite set of n real numbers x = (x 1, [...] .,xn) generating a random set y = (y 1, [...] .,ym) of m ≤ n real numbers whose distribution is determined by x. Spectral sampling is not the same as simple random sampling in the sense that y is not a subset of x, but the parallels are unmistakable and striking. In particular, there exist symmetric functions Kλ—analogous to <b>k-statistics</b> and polykays—such that E(Kλ(y) | x) ...|$|E

The classical umbral calculus is a light syntax to manage sequences of numbers or polynomials, involving only elementary rules. The keystone of the procedures here introduced is the connection, achieved by a symbolic device, between cumulants of a random variable and a suitable compound Poisson random variable.

40|$|Many {{tests for}} mean {{differences}} utilize statistics based on a. comparison of 'hypothesis ' and 'residual ' sums of squares. The probability distribution of such statistics usually is derived {{under the assumption}} of normally distributed errors. The frequent occurrence of data from non-normal distributions leads one to ask how closely the actual distributions are approximated by their normally derived counter-parts. Permutation theory, which {{has been used to}} investigate this question in univariate situations, is applied here to the multivariate trace statistic. The results, summa. rized at the end of section 4, indicate that the permutation distri-bution of the trace statistic is reasonably approximated by its normally derived counterpart for a wide class of non-normal situations.

40|$|Several metrics {{have been}} {{developed}} for estimating phylogenetic signal in comparative data. These may be important both in guiding future studies on correlated evolution and for inferring broad-scale evolutionary and ecological processes (e. g., phylogenetic niche conservatism). Notwithstanding, the validity of some of these metrics is under debate, especially after the development of more sophisticated model-based approaches that estimate departure from particular evolutionary models (i. e., Brownian motion). Here, two of these model-based metrics (Blomberg’s <b>K-statistics</b> and Pagel’s) are compared with three statistical approaches [Moran’s I autocorrelation coefficient, coefficients of determination from the autoregressive method (ARM), and phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) ]. Based on simulations of a trait evolving under Brownian motion for a phylogeny with 209 species, we showed that all metrics are strongly, although non-linearly, correlated to each other.

We sought to determine the stability of the clinical etiologic diagnosis over time and to identify factors associated with instability. We identified 4141 patients with dementia or mild cognitive impairment who made at least 2 visits approximately a year apart to a dementia research center, receiving a clinical etiologic diagnosis on each visit. We assessed con-cordance of etiologic diagnoses across visits, <b>k-statistics,</b> and transition probabilities among diagnoses. The primary clinical etiologic diagnosis remained stable for 91 % of patients but with a net shift toward dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer’s disease. Lower diagnostic stability was significantly associated with older age, nonwhite race, milder disease at presentation, more underlying conditions contributing to cognitive decline, lack of a consistent spouse/partner informant, and being evaluated by different clinicians on different visits. Multistate Markov modeling generally confirmed these associations. Clinical etiologic diagnoses were generally stable. However, several readily ascertained characteristics were associated with higher instability. These associations may be useful to clinicians for anticipating when an etiologic diagnosis may be more prone to future change...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to determine wild vertebrate roadkill aggregations on a stretch of 96 kilometers of the BR- 050 highway, between the cities of Uberlândia and Uberaba, State of Minas Gerais, Brazil. The survey was conducted between April 2012 and March 2013. Roadkill monitoring was performed by car, at a speed of approximately 60 km/h, and forty two (42) weekly trips, totaling 8064 km, were performed. The 2 D Ripley's <b>K-Statistics</b> test from the Siriema v 1. 1 program was used to detect the scales of roadkill aggregations and 2 D HotSpot Identification test was used to identify the location of these hotspots. Aggregations extended from the following kms: 14 to 33, 38, 41 to 51, 66 to 70 and 78 to 94. We found roadkill aggregations for wild vertebrates and mammals. The roadkill aggregations were significant for Euphractus sexcinctus, Conepatus semistriatus, Procyon cancrivorus, Hydrochoerus hydrochoerus, Cariama cristata, Boa constrictor amarali and Crotalus durissus collilineatus according to the taxonomic specific level.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{introduce}} a staging of pelvic endometriosis based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) features, {{compared with the}} American Fertility Society (AFS) laparoscopic classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five consecutive females with clinically suspected endometriosis underwent MRI examination using TSE T 1, T 2 W, and SE FAT-SAT T 1 W sequences, to demonstrate the presence of endometriomas and pelvic implants. Laparoscopy was performed within two weeks (mean 8 days) of the examination. A radiologist experienced in pelvic pathology evaluated the presence of endometriomas and implants and calculated a score to classify endometriosis in four classes, comparable with those of AFS laparoscopic staging. The MRI score was based on size, edges, wall thickness, septations, signal intensity on T 2 -weighted images of endometriomas and presence of pelvic implants. The concordance between MRI and laparoscopic classification was evaluated using <b>k-statistics.</b> RESULTS: Laparoscopy confirmed 47 / 48 endometriomas, {{ranging in size from}} 10 to 62 mm, detected by MRI, with only one false positive due to an hemorrhagic corpus luteum. Nevertheless, 2 intra-ovarian endometriomas were detected by laparoscopy only thanks MRI guidance. Implants were discovered in 17 / 30 patients with MRI, laparoscopically in 18 / 30.

The {{aim of this}} article was to propose a new objective method (UniFe) in order to simplify the risk assessment procedures. UniFe was compared with a computer-based risk assessment tool (PAT(R)). METHODS: Risk scores for both UniFe and PAT(R) were calculated for 107 patients, randomly selected among patients seeking care at a specialist periodontal clinic. For UniFe risk calculation, the ''parameter scores'' assigned to smoking status, diabetic status, number of sites with probing depth 5 mm, bleeding on probing score (BoP) and bone loss/age, were added and the sum was referred to a ''risk score'', ranging from 1 (low risk) to 5 (high risk). PAT(R) generated a risk score on a scale from 1 (lowest risk) to 5 (highest risk). RESULTS: The mean UniFe and PAT(R) risk scores were 4. 5 +/- 0. 9 and 4. 6 +/- 0. 7, respectively. Cohen <b>k-statistics</b> amounted to 0. 7, suggesting a good agreement between methods. Difference in risk score between methods was significantly explained by the parameter scores of BoP and bone loss/age (adjusted R 2 = 0. 378).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe prior negative screening history and symptoms around the time of diagnosis of incident cervical cancer (CC) cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2010 within the Asturias public health system. Records from 374 women diagnosed with CC between 2000 and 2010 from all public hospitals in Asturias were retrieved. Clinical information, FIGO stage and all previous cytological data were extracted from clinical and histopathological records. Proportional differences were assessed using chi-square tests. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Inter-observer agreement in cytology was checked by comparing concordance values using <b>k-statistics.</b> No prior screening history was recorded in 60. 7 % of CC cases and its absence increased with age and advanced stage. Advanced stage (e. g., ≥ II) at diagnosis was associated with age (> 50 years) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) compared to younger women and those with a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). False negative smears were identified in 27. 1 % of women with CC (ADC 52. 6 % vs. SCC 16. 2 %, p< 0. 05). Absence of prior screening history was common among CC cases.

40|$|Purpose: To compare {{image quality}} on {{computed}} tomographic (CT) images acquired with filtered backprojection (FBP), adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) techniques in CT KUB examination. Methods and Materials: 20 patients were scanned with standard protocol CT KUB at our institution. Same raw data were reconstructed using FBP, ASIR and MBIR. Objective and subjective image qualities were assessed. Quantitative data such as objective image noise and mean attenuation were analysed by comparing standard deviations, 95 % confidence interval and calculating percentage difference. Mean image noise values and attenuation values were compared between different reconstruction algorithms using ANOVA. The interobserver variation and percentage {{agreement between the}} two radiologists {{for each of the}} assessed subjective image quality and lesion assessment parameters were estimated by using weighted <b>k-statistics.</b> Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test was used to test for equality of median scores among all subjective parameters. Results: Objective image analysis supports significant noise reduction and superior contrast-to-noise ratio with new MBIR technique (p < 0. 05). Subjective image parameters were maximally rated for MBIR followed by ASIR then FBP and show statistical significance differences (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: MBIR shows superior reduction in noise and improved image quality (both objective and subjective analysis) compared with ASIR and FBP in the context of CT KUB scanning which is inherently a noisy study. At same dose, we have shown that image quality can be improved by applying MBIR in clinical practice, and if available should be utilised. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Methods: From March 2001 through March 2003, all consecutive stroke patients admitted to Vali-e- Asr Hospital, Birjand, Khorasan, Iran were included in this prospective observational study. Patients underwent a standard battery of diagnostic investigations by a stroke neurologist. Data on patients, demographics, clinical presentations, and diagnostic work-up were kept in a database. Two stroke neurologists and a general practitioner independently reviewed the data of 20 randomly selected patients and classified patients according to the PIC classification of stroke topography and etiology. The PIC is designed by stroke neurologists and approved in the University of Alberta, Canada. The degrees of interrater agreement were measured with unweighted <b>k-statistics.</b> Results: Among 302 stroke patients, 20 patients (11 females, 9 males) were randomly selected.

Hanbury Brown-Twiss {{interferometry}} is {{a correlation}} technique {{by which the}} size and shape of the emission function of identical particles created during collisions of high-energy leptons, hadrons or nuclei can be determined. Accurate experimental datasets of three-dimensional correlation functions in momentum space now exist; these are sometimes almost Gaussian in form, but may also show strong deviations from Gaussian shapes. We investigate the suitability of expressing these correlation functions in terms of statistical quantities beyond the normal Gaussian description. Beyond means and the covariance matrix, higher-order moments and cumulants describe the form and di erence between the measured correlation function and a Gaussian distribution. The corresponding series expansion is the Gram- Charlier series and in particular the Gram-Charlier Type A expansion found in the literature, which is based on a Gaussian reference distribution. We investigate both the Gram-Charlier Type A series as well as generalised forms based on non-Gaussian reference distributions, as well as the related Edgeworth expansion. For testing purposes, experimental data is initially represented by a suite of one-dimensional analytic non-Gaussian distributions. We conclude that the accuracy of these expansions can be improved dramatically through a better choice of reference distribution, suggested by the sign and size of the kurtosis of the experimental distribution. We further extend our investigation to simulated samples of such test distributions and simplify the theoretical expressions for unbiased estimators (<b>k-statistics)</b> for the case of symmetric distributions...|$|E
40|$|The Class Imbalance problem {{occurs when}} {{there are many more}} {{instances}} of some class than others. i. e. skewed class distribution. In cases like this, standard classifier tends to be overwhelmed by the majority class and ignores the minority class. It is one of the 10 challenging problems of data mining research and pattern recognition. This imbalanced dataset degrades the performance of the classifier as accuracy is tendered towards the majority class. Several techniques have been proposed to solve this problem. This paper aims to improve the true positive rate / detection of the minority class (GDM) which is the class of interest. This study proposes the use of two under sampling techniques reported in the literature. It involves under sampling the majority class which balances the dataset before classification. These under sampling schemes were evaluated on three learning algorithms (Decision tree both pruned and un- pruned and RIPPER) using Matthew’s Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and Kappa Statistics as metrics. The implementation of these under sampling techniques was assessed in the medical domain. The real life dataset collected contained 886 instance of patients with diabetes mellitus disease. The diagnosis was in three classes with the following class distribution TYPE 1 containing 62 instances, TYPE 2 containing 807 instances and Gestation Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) which is the class of interest containing only 17 instances.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the performance of}} the spine sign in detecting lower chest abnormalities in the lateral view. Methods: This retrospective study included 200 patients who had undergone lateral view and CT scans of the chest within 1 week. Two radiologists independently read the lateral views, and a third radiologist, blinded to the aim of the study, read the scans. The spine sign was considered as positive if the progressive increase in lucency of the vertebral bodies was altered. Interreader agreement was calculated through <b>k-statistics.</b> Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, and accuracy were calculated compared with CT. Results: Agreements between readers ranged from 0. 12 to 0. 68. Positive spine sign could appear in two ways: absent or inversed progressive increase in lucency of the vertebral bodies. Sensitivity, specificity, positive- and negative-predictive values, and accuracy were, respectively, 60 % and 70 %; 64 % and 84 %; 91 % and 97 %; 19 % and 29 %; and 61 % and 72 % for each reader (p-value ranging from 0. 026 to 0. 196). Abnormalities most frequently associated with positive spine sign were plate-like atelectasis, ground-glass opacity, pleural effusion and consolidation. Conclusion: The spine sign can present as an absent or inversed progressive increase in lucency of the vertebral bodies. It has a moderate sensitivity but a good positive-predictive value, so it can be useful especially when it appears as inversed progressive increase in lucency of the vertebral bodies to detect various abnormalities usually identifiable on chest radiographs. Advances in knowledge: On lateral chest radiographs, the spine sign is useful to detect lower chest abnormalities and is related to various underlying abnormalities and is, per se, non-specific.

40|$|Aims According to the {{classification}} {{established by the}} Japanese Society for Oesophageal Disease, early oesophageal cancer can be subdivided into six successive layers of the mucosa or submucosa, which influences the treatment strategy and prognosis of the individual patient. However, the reproducibility of this classification in terms of inter-and intraobserver variability is unclear. Methods Histological slides from 105 surgical resection specimens of patients who had undergone oesophagectomy for early oesophageal adenocarcinoma were reviewed independently by three gastrointestinal pathologists, and were classified according to the Japanese criteria (m 1 /m 2 /m 3 /sm 1 /sm 2 /sm 3 tumours). Inter-and intraobserver variation was determined by <b>k-statistics.</b> Results The interobserver reproducibility was good between pathologist 1 and 2 (kappa= 0. 61, 95 % CI 0. 55 to 0. 67), and moderate between pathologist 1 and 3 (kappa- 0. 51, 95 % CI 0. 45 to 0. 57) and between pathologist 2 and 3 (kappa= 0. 50, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 0. 61). The intraobserver agreement as assessed by the expert pathologist was good (kappa= 0. 76), with a 95 % CI that was interpreted as good to very good (0. 67 to 0. 85). Most agreement was achieved at the lower (m 1) and upper site (sm 2, sm 3) of the spectrum, whereas the m 2 tumours reflected the most discrepant stage. The majority of the observed discrepancy included the variation in one substage only.

A table of 164 male of Kyushu University students was included in this study. The skinfold thicknesses of mid-triceps and subscaplar of each subject were measured by a single observer using the pinch caliper method within the second weeks of new college life. <b>K-statistics</b> of each skinfold were obtained from raw data and the frequency table by the third and fourth order moments and percentile scores. The g l, SKQ., and SKD. statistics show skewness of {{the distribution}}, and g 2 and kappa show kurtosis. The results obtained were as follows: 1) Comparing cumulative frequency curve of mid-triceps and subscaplar skinfold thicknesses with each other, the subscaplar were up to 50 % ile greater than the mid-triceps. Thereafter, the difference gradually decreased. 2) The skewness of skinfolds obtained by both raw data and frequency table was positive. The subscaplar was more skewed than the mid-triceps. The distribution in the moment system was leptokurtic. 3) The skewness and kurtosis of the percentile score was smaller than in the moment system. In one cases, a negative value was observed. 4) These analyses showed that skinfold thickness have positive skewness and leptokurtic types except in the skewness of triceps indicated in the frequency table. 5) The normal distribution was not shown in the test of normality. Its distribution was considered to have a log normal distribution as with other attributes of human beings. The asymmetry of all skinfold thicknesses was shown in nearly all statistical procedures; that is, the distribution types skewed to the left and they have the long tail. 18 才から 20 才までの大学新入学生を対象に腕部,背部の皮下脂肪厚をpinch caliper法によって測定し,基本統計量を求めるとともに,正規性検定を中心とした解析を行なった。結果は以下のように要約できる。 1) 累積度数曲線は最少値から 5 ％ile値までは, 3 mm前後の差をもって二部位間で平行であったが,それ以後は二部位間の差が減少する傾向にあった。 2) 二部位の皮脂厚についてモーメント系の尖度,歪度をraw dataおよび度数分布表から求め,分位数系の尖度,歪度を%ile値から求めた。モーメント系の尖度とも,背部＞腕榔の順となり,いずれもleptokuric, positive skewnessの様態を示すことがわかった。 3) 分位数系の尖度,歪度はモーメン系に比して尖度,歪度とも数値は相当に異なり,負の値を示す場合もあった。 4) 尖度,歪度ともその標準誤差との比をt検定で検定した。正規性は度数分布表を用いた上腕部で正規性を認めることができたが,背部およびraw dataでは正規性は棄却された。 5) 二部位の皮脂厚は通常の正規分布よりもむしろ対数正規分布というべきタイプのものであることがわかった...|$|E
40|$|When making judgements of {{the quality}} of survey sampling, {{especially}} with the complex estimators, the method of variance estimation is of importance. In addition to the well-known linearisation approach, there are many methods based on the sample reuse. The variety of these methods, especially in sampling theory, does not have any unified theoretical framework. The first part of the thesis is a theoretical overview for variance estimation, covering the foundations of the sampling theory and the current methodology of variance estimation. Also new methods and theoretical results are provided in the thesis. The cumulants and <b>k-statistics</b> are utilised to study the theoretical correction coefficient of unbiased variance estimation. Some examples of this approach are given for the variance estimation of the estimator of the population variance. The post-design vectors, i. e. artificially expanded design vectors for variance estimation, are used as the scale adjustment needed to correct the effect of the difference between the sampling design and resampling design. There are also correction methods utilising two-phase resample spaces and alternatively two resample to introduce various estimator-dependent scale corrections. New sampling distribution results concerning without-replacement and with-replacement designs in two-phase sampling situations are presented. A variance decomposition approach utilising sample pair probabilities is given with variance estimators. Finally, both old and new methods are tested with two real small populations. Results reveal e. g. that the two-phase resample approach deminishes the bias almost for every estimator studied, and for one estimator the sample pair probability approach provides unbiased variance estimator.

Increased objectivity can potentially be obtained using semiquantitative analysis. In this study, we assessed whether semiquantitative analysis of 123 I-FP-CIT tracer binding created more reproducible clinical reporting. A secondary {{aim was to}} determine in what form semiquantitative data should be provided to the reporter. Methods: Fifty-four patients referred {{for the assessment of}} nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration were scanned using SPECT/CT, followed by semiquantitative analysis calculating striatal binding ratios (SBRs) and caudate-to-putamen ratios (CPRs). Normal reference values were obtained using 131 healthy controls enrolled on a multicenter initiative backed by the European Association of Nuclear Medicine. A purely quantitative evaluation was first performed, with each striatum scored as normal or abnormal according to reference values. Three experienced nuclear medicine physicians then scored each striatum as normal or abnormal, also indicating cases perceived as difficult, using visual evaluation, visual evaluation in combination with SBR data, and visual evaluation in combination with SBR and CPR data. Intra- and interobserver agreement and agreement between observers and the purely quantitative evaluation were assessed using <b>k-statistics.</b> The agreement between scan interpretation and clinical diagnosis was assessed for patients with a postscan clinical diagnosis available (n = 35). Results: The physicians showed consistent reporting, with a good intraobserver agreement obtained for the visual interpretation (mean κ ± SD, 0. 95 ± 0. 029). Although visual interpretation of tracer binding gave good interobserver agreement (0. 80 ± 0. 045), this was improved as SBRs (0. 86 ± 0. 070) and CPRs (0. 95 ± 0. 040) were provided. The number of striata perceived as difficult to interpret decreased as semiquantitative data were provided (30 for the visual interpretation; 0 as SBR and CPR values were given). The agreement between physicians' interpretations and the purely quantitative evaluation showed that readers used the semiquantitative data to different extents, with a more experienced reader relying less on the semiquantitative data. Good agreement between scan interpretation and clinical diagnosis was seen. Conclusion: A combined approach of visual assessment and semiquantitative analysis of tracer binding created more reproducible clinical reporting of 123 I-FP-CIT SPECT studies. Physicians should have access to both SBR and CPR data to minimize interobserver variability. Copyright © 2013 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc...|$|E
40|$|Chronic {{inflammation}} {{has been}} repeatedly reported in individuals undergoing hemodialysis. C-reactive protein (CRP) {{is considered a}} marker of chronic inflammation, {{as well as a}} mediator of the atherosclerotic process. Clinical and epidemiologic studies are based on plasma values obtained with the use of various automated methods. Our aim was to test 3 commercially available methods and compare the values obtained with the use of these tests in a population of individuals undergoing hemodialysis. We compared the following methods: immunoturbidimetry (AU 2700 biochemistry analyzer; Olympus, Rungis, France) laser nephelometry (Behring Diagnostics, Marburg, Germany), and nephelometry (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, Calif. The 3 methods were used in 3 different centers: Montpellier, France; and Pisa and Turin, Italy, respectively. We prepared samples for the estimation of imprecision values (ie, coefficient of variation (CV)) from the plasma of normal patients by adding purified C-reactive protein at concentrations ranging from 2. 6 to 180 mg/L for intraassay variation and concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 150, and 180 mg/L for interassay variation. Intraassay imprecision was determined with the use of 10 replicate analyses on the same sample of the same day. We assessed interassay imprecision using the same sample, divided into aliquots and measured on 5 consecutive days. Agreement between methods was assessed on predialysis serum samples collected from patients with stable chronic kidney disease who were undergoing long-term hemodialysis at the 3 different centers (Montpellier, 192; Pisa, 56; Turin, 98). Serum was separated from the red cells and stored in 3 aliquots at - 70 degrees C until it could be analyzed. Samples were thawed only once, circulated among the 3 centers, and each tested, with all 3 of the methods. The Beckman method yielded the most precise results, with intraassay CVs ranging from I to 2 and interassay CVs ranging from 1 to 4. The Behring method was the least precise, with intraassay and interassay CVs ranging from 12 to 15 and 7 to 16, respectively. The results of the Olympus method fell between those of the other 2 methods. Agreement between the results of the Olympus and Behring methods was satisfactorily. The Beckman and Olympus methods yielded, on average, similar results over the entire range of CRP values. We detected significant disagreement between the Beckman method and the other 2 methods, obtaining results 10 to 100 times lower with the Beckman method. This became evident in terms Of <b>K-statistics.</b> Our findings emphasize the need for careful assessment of the methods used to detect CRP in serum samples. Failure to do so may ultimately {{have a negative impact on}} the real relevance of CRP as a marker and on the role of chronic implication particularly in epidemiologic studies...|$|E
