5000|$|Supernova discoveries are {{reported}} to the IAU's Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams and are automatically given a provisional designation based on the co-ordinates of the discovery. Historically, when supernovae are identified as belonging to a [...] "type", CBAT has also published circulars with assigned year-letter designations, and discovery details. A supernova's permanent designation is formed by the standard prefix [...] "SN", the year of discovery, and a suffix composed {{of one or two}} letters of the Latin alphabet. The first 26 supernovae of the year receive a capital letter from A to Z. Subsequent supernovae of that year are designated with pairs of lower-case letters from [...] "aa" [...] to [...] "az", and then continuing with [...] "ba" [...] until [...] "zz". For example, the prominent SN 1987A, {{was the first one to}} be observed in 1987. Several thousand supernovae have been reported since 1885. In recent years, several supernova discovery projects have retained their more distant supernova discoveries for <b>in-house</b> <b>follow-up,</b> and not reported them to CBAT. Starting in 2015, CBAT has scaled back its efforts to publish assigned designations of typed supernovae: By September 2014, CBAT had published names and details of 100 supernovae discovered in that year. By September 2015, CBAT had only published names of 20 supernovae discovered in that year. The Astronomer's Telegram provides some surrogate services independent from CBAT.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{heterogeneous}} {{group of}} conditions can cause {{changes to the}} intraocular lens (IOL) during or after implantation in uneventful cataract surgery. We describe a series of 5 patients presenting distinctive deposits {{on the surface of}} hydrophilic intraocular lenses, implanted during routine cataract surgery, with a follow-up of 1 to 24 months. Disposable forceps were found to be the source of the pigmented marks when used to hold the lens during the injector loading process. At the slit-lamp examination, the pigments were located in the centre of the lens optic, easily detectable. Although involving the visual axis, none of the patients were visually affected. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} such unusual occurrence has been described. The reported case-series shows the importance of <b>in-house</b> <b>follow-up</b> after cataract surgery...|$|E
40|$|Remote {{follow-up}} of implanted ICD’s offers {{a solution to}} the problem of overcrowded clinics. All major device companies have developed a remote follow-up solution. Data from the remote follow-up are stored in a central database system, operated by the device company and accessible for the physician. However, the problem now arises that part of the patient’s clinical information is stored in the local electronic health record (EHR) system in the hospital, while another part is only available in the remote monitoring database. In our hospital, we have implemented the IHE-IDCO profile to import data from the remote databases from two device vendors into our self-developed Cardiology Information System (EPD-Vision). Data is exchanged via a HL 7 /XML communication protocol, as defined in the IHE-IDCO profile. Remote follow-up data is visible in EPD-Vision ™ in the same manner as the data from the <b>in-house</b> <b>follow-up.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dementia among {{nursing home}} {{residents}} is often accompanied by high care dependency and behavioral disturbances, resulting in an increased workload for the caregivers. Snoezelen, integrated into 24 -hour dementia care, is an approach that might {{improve the quality of}} working life of dementia caregivers. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of integrated snoezelen on work-related outcomes (workload and psychological outcomes) of caregivers in psychogeriatric nursing homes. METHODS: A quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design was used, comparing six psychogeriatric wards that implemented snoezelen in 24 -hour care to six control wards that continued giving usual care. One hundred and twenty-nine Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) were included in the pre-test and 127 CNAs in the post-test. The six intervention wards received a 4 -day in-house training program. The intervention further consisted of implementation activities on the ward (e. g. stimulus preference screening, workgroup), three <b>in-house</b> <b>follow-up</b> meetings and two general meetings. Measurements on workload, perceived problems, stress reactions, job satisfaction and burnout were performed at baseline and after 18 months. RESULTS: A significant treatment effect in favor of the experimental group was found for time pressure, perceived problems, stress reactions and emotional exhaustion. CNAs of the experimental group also improved on their overall job satisfaction score. In particular, they were more satisfied with the quality of care and with their contact with residents. CONCLUSION: The implementation of snoezelen improved the quality of the working life of dementia caregiver...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES To {{examine the}} haemodynamic {{performance}} of the St Jude Trifecta valve for aortic valve replacement (AVR) at 3 years after implantation. METHODS In a single-centre, prospective, observational, independent study, we enrolled 122 patients who had AVR using a Trifecta bioprosthesis in the July 2010 –June 2011 period. A clinical and echocardiographic <b>in-house</b> <b>follow-up</b> was scheduled. RESULTS In our series, 14. 7 % of patients received a 19 -mm, 28. 7 % had a 21 -mm, 35. 2 % had a 23 -mm and 21. 3 % had a greater-size prosthesis. There were no cases of operative mortality or of valve-related complications both early and at follow-up (except one sudden unexplained death). Completeness of the 3 -year echocardiographic follow-up was 80 % among survivors. The average mean transvalvular gradient (mTVG) at 3 years was 14. 2, 10. 8, 8. 6, 7. 1 and 6. 8 mmHg (sizes 19 to 27 / 29, respectively). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between average mTVGs measured immediately after implantation versus at the 3 -year follow-up in the overall population. The average peak transvalvular gradient (pTVG) at 3 years was 25, 20, 16. 8, 13. 9 and 14. 4 mmHg (sizes 19 to 27 / 29, respectively). The average indexed effective orifice area (iEOA) at 3 years was 0. 8, 0. 9, 1, 1. 3 and 1. 3 cm 2 /m 2 (sizes 19 – 27, respectively). The rate of moderate patient–prosthesis mismatch (PPM) at 3 years was 15. 7 %; there were two instances of severe PPM (2. 2 %). All cases of PPM occurred in the 19, 21 and 23 mm size subgroups. CONCLUSIONS The Trifecta valve retains its excellent haemodynamic properties at the 3 -year follow-up. The rate of PPM is considerably lo...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{starts with}} a review of {{relevant}} literature {{with regard to the}} effects of psychosocial interventions, including snoezelen, on apathetic, depressed and aggressive behaviour of demented persons. Then, a study with a quasi-experimental pre-test and post-test design is described, comparing six psychogeriatric wards, that implemented snoezelen in 24 -h care, to six control wards, that continued in giving usual care. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate the effects of snoezelen, or multi-sensory stimulation, integrated in 24 -h dementia care on (i) caregivers'and residents' verbal and nonverbal communication; (ii) the quality of caregivers' behaviour; (iii) mood and behaviour of demented nursing home residents and; (iv) work-related outcomes of caregivers in psychogeriatric care. 125 residents with moderate to severe dementia were included in the pre-test and 128 in the post-test. Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) of the six intervention wards received a four-day in-house training program 'snoezelen for caregivers'. The intervention further consisted of implementation activities in the ward (e. g., history taking, stimulus preference screening, workgroup), three <b>in-house</b> <b>follow-up</b> meetings and two general meetings. Quantitative measurements, i. e., video-recordings of morning care, observations in the ward and questionnaires, were performed at baseline (pre-test) and 18 months after the start of the implementation of snoezelen (post-test). Additionally, a qualitative evaluation of the implementation process took place to find out to which extent the intervention had been delivered as intended. The results revealed that trained CNAs showed a significant increase of resident-directed gaze, affective touch and smiling during morning care. The total number of verbal utterances also increased. Regarding residents a significant treatment effect was found for smiling, CNA-directed gaze, negative verbal behaviours (less disapproval and anger) and verbal expressed autonomy. The video-observations also showed a significant increase of positive behaviours ('Positive Person Work') by CNAs and a decrease of negative behaviours ('Malignant Social Psychology'). This indicated that trained CNAs succeeded in performing a more person-centred approach. Moreover, the mean number of sensory stimuli, offered explicitly, increased. Residents receiving snoezel care demonstrated a significant treatment effect with respect to their level of apathetic behaviour, loss of decorum, rebellious behaviour, aggressive behaviour and depression. During morning care, the residents of the experimental group showed significant changes in well-being (mood, happiness, enjoyment, sadness) and adaptive behaviour (responding to speaking, relating to caregiver). Morning care by trained CNAs appeared to take more time. This suggests that (some) time investment might be required to achieve positive effects on CNA and resident outcomes. This did not result into increased workload. The analysis of work-related outcomes showed a significant effect in favour of the experimental group for time pressure, perceived problems, stress reactions and emotional exhaustion. CNAs of the experimental group also improved on their overall job satisfaction score. They were especially more satisfied with the quality of care and with their contact with residents. This study indicates that the implementation of snoezelen in 24 -h daily care improves the quality of life of demented nursing home residents and the quality of working life of nurses in psychogeriatric care...|$|E
