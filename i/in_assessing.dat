The assertion is that low crime rates, minimal incidences of terrorist acts and violent demonstrations, harmonious relations with neighboring countries, a stable political scene and a small proportion of the population being internally displaced or refugees can be equated with peacefulness.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the literature on the sale price appraisal ratio (SPAR) as an alternative house price index methodology. Housing market transaction data for 12 cities or districts in New Zealand for the period 1994 – 2004 is utilised to test the effect of measurement errors <b>in</b> <b>assessed</b> values on index accuracy and temporal aggregation on index stability. The main findings are: 1) temporal aggregation effect on the SPAR index stability is a constraint at the monthly level with respect to this New Zealand data set. 2) reporting sample size has a much larger effect on the precision of the SPAR index than the frequency of reassessments. Random measurement errors <b>in</b> <b>assessed</b> values tend to cancel out each other when the number of sales per period is large. 3) Any reassessment tends to disturb the SPAR index for the reassessment period. Consistency errors <b>in</b> <b>assessed</b> values tend to be more likely to accumulate when more frequent reassessment exercises are engaged...|$|R

5|$|Another area of {{interest}} is <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> whether keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) {{would be better than}} Whipple's procedure in treating the disease surgically, particularly in terms of recovery time. Irreversible electroporation is a relatively novel ablation technique that has shown promise in downstaging and prolonging survival in persons with locally advanced disease. It is especially suitable for treatment of tumors that are in proximity to peri-pancreatic vessels without risk of vascular trauma. The limited success of outcomes after surgery has led to a number of trials that were running in 2014 to test outcomes using chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy before surgery. This had previously not been found to be helpful, but is being trialed again, using drug combinations which have emerged from the many trials of post-operative therapies, such as FOLFIRINOX.|$|E

5|$|As AOC Training Command in 1954, Murdoch {{headed a}} program to {{determine}} aircraft purchases for the RAAF; his recommendations included the C-130 Hercules transport, {{considered one of the}} most important acquisitions in the Air Force's history. His term as CAS coincided with increased commitment to the Vietnam War, and he came into conflict with Australian Army commanders over the employment of helicopters in battle. He was also involved <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> the readiness of the General Dynamics F-111C for RAAF service. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1960 and Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1966, Murdoch was the fourth in a series of CASs who had been cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. He retired from the Air Force in December 1969, and died in 1984.|$|E
5|$|CAP {{is active}} in {{disaster}} relief operations, especially {{in areas such as}} Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana that are frequently struck by hurricanes as well as Oklahoma and Texas which are frequented by large, damaging tornadoes.

In 2004, several hurricanes hit the southeast coast of the United States, with Florida being the worst damaged; CAP was instrumental in providing help to affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Films {{generate}} {{income from}} several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> {{the success of a}} film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, a timeline showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{discovery}} of the decline of lion population in Africa, several coordinated efforts involving lion conservation have been organised in an attempt to stem this decline. Lions are one species included in the Species Survival Plan, a coordinated attempt by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to increase its chances of survival. The plan was originally started in 1982 for the Asiatic lion, but was suspended when it was found that most Asiatic lions in North American zoos were not genetically pure, having been hybridised with African lions. The African lion plan started in 1993, focusing especially on the South African subspecies, although there are difficulties <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> the genetic diversity of captive lions, since most individuals are of unknown origin, making maintenance of genetic diversity a problem.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Apollo 1 fire, to avoid {{appearance}} of a conflict of interest, NASA Administrator James E. Webb asked President Lyndon B.

Seamans then directed establishment of the Apollo 204 Review Board chaired by Langley Research Center director Floyd L. Thompson, which included astronaut Frank Borman, spacecraft designer Maxime Faget, and six others. On February 1, Cornell University professor Frank A.

5|$|One of the {{challenges}} <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> progress {{in this area is}} the number of clinical studies that either do not report the gender of the subjects or lack the statistical power to detect gender differences.

Consequently, a number of funding agencies and scientific journals are asking researchers to explicitly address issus of sex and gender in their research.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} for Defoe's contemporaries <b>in</b> <b>assessing</b> whether {{the work was}} ironic was {{the proximity of the}} speaker's voice to that of the High Anglicans whose views are being ridiculed. The pamphlet mixes both real observation and fabrication, and assumes the rhetorical style of his target. Defoe uses and imitates the language and metaphor of fanatical churchman, particularly Sacheverell's sermons; the speaker's comparison of the Dissenters to vipers is one that Sacheverell often made. Although The Shortest Way does not parody the genre of the Anglican sermon, it does deploy some of the same structures; the initial Aesopic fable of the Cock and the Horses is expanded upon in a way that parallels the use of a biblical quotation to initiate a sermon.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{gameplay}} {{information was}} also criticized.
