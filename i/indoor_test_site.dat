Ideal site attenuation values are compared with three-dimensional (3 -D) finite-element results in the frequency range required by the standards. The results show significant errors in computing 3 -meter (m) site attenuation in the 30 - 300 MHz frequency range. New values for the normalized site attenuation are then given for 3 -m measurements.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a validation method for <b>indoor</b> <b>testing</b> of a passenger car suspension. A study {{was done to}} design a supporting modular structure with comparable inertances {{with respect to a}} vehicle's actual suspension and body connection points. For the <b>indoor</b> <b>test,</b> the rear axle is positioned on a rotating drum. The suspension system is excited as the wheel passes over cleats fixed on the drum and transient wheel motions are recorded. The <b>indoor</b> <b>test</b> rig outputs (i. e., wheel and chassis accelerations) were compared with experimental data measured on an actual vehicle running at different speeds on the same set of cleats along a flat road. The comparison results validate the <b>indoor</b> <b>testing</b> method. The forces and moments acting at each suspension and chassis connection point were measured with a set of patented six-axis load cells. The forces, moments, wheel and subframe accelerations were measured up to 120 Hz. This study yielded a set of performance indexes by analyzing the forces and acceleration measured on the suspension system (the force measure is possible only on the <b>indoor</b> <b>test</b> rig). The influence of the running conditions and suspension settings on the indexes for vibration behaviour of the tire and suspension system was assessed and a global sensitivity analysis has been completed...|$|R

40|$|Standard test procedures, ''IEEE P 1526 /D 1 Draft Recommended Practice for Testing the Performance of Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems,'' [1] {{have been}} {{developed}} to assess the performance of stand-alone PV systems tested outdoors under prevailing conditions. A copy of the procedures is included in Appendix E. This report presents an overview of the procedures and results from three validation tests conducted between January 1999 and September 2000 at one European and four US <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> There was good measurement agreement between the results measured at different <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> on similar systems. To date, most PV system performance test procedures have looked at the performance of the individual components and have not addressed how the integrated system works as a whole. The performance test procedures described in this report verify that the system and load operate as expected, ensure that the PV array and system are capable of recharging the battery, determine the usable battery capacity (UBC), and determine if there is any significant change in the UBC measured three different times during the procedures. The procedures have been submitted to both IEEE SCC 21 and IEC TC 82 for use in developing standards. The IEEE SCC 21 has initiated P 1526, ''Recommended Practice for Testing the Performance of Stand-Alone Photovoltaic Systems,'' [1] and the IEC TC 82 has initiated Standard 62124, ''Photovoltaic Stand-Alone Systems Design Qualification and Type Approval'' [2].

40|$|Extreme climatic locations, such as arid or {{maritime}} regions, {{are very}} demanding for solar energy systems. In this paper we share experiences about the soiling of surfaces, exposed for {{one and two}} years at outdoor weathering <b>tests</b> <b>sites</b> with different climatic conditions, and their effect on the surface properties. We describe an inhouse developed soiling test, to qualify glazing with realistic dust for reproducible and homogeneous test results. The second part of this paper describes characterization measurements by spectral transmittance, especially after applying the dusting method. Next to soiling, a roughening of glazing surfaces in arid areas {{is most likely to}} occur, especially due to sand storms. To simulate this abrasive stress an additional test of the stability of the functional coatings is developed and applied. The abrasion test is conducted with an in-house developed sand trickling test stand according to DIN 52 348.

40|$|Debris {{landslides}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} widely distributed types of landslides in the Wenchuan earthquake area. The hydro-geological structure characteristics are the fundamental basis for stability evaluation, performing protection and administration of a landslide. The rock and soil mass of a debris landslide was highly non-uniform and preferential seepage paths were normally developed in it. Therefore, in situ identification of the underground water seepage system became particularly important. Recently, investigations on the seepage paths of underground water in debris landslides were restricted to <b>indoor</b> model <b>testing</b> and <b>site</b> observation, which were far from meeting the actual demand for landslide prevention and mitigation. To locate the seepage paths, we conducted survey work on a debris landslide seated in the Xishan Village, Li County, Sichuan Province, China, by combing four different geophysical methods. They were multichannel analysis of surface wave (MASW), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), ground penetrating radar (GPR) and microtremor survey method (MSM). The geophysical interpretation was verified with field engineering surveys and monitoring data. The results suggested that a dendritic pipe-network seepage system usually developed in debris landslides. Varisized infiltration pipes showed the characteristics of inhomogeneity and concentration of the seepage. This work highlighted that geophysical parameters (shear wave velocity Vs, dielectric constant ε and resistivity value ρ) could provide reliable qualitative and quantitative information about the colluvial layer, bedrock interface, potential sliding surface and underground water seepage system of a landslide. The optimum combination of geophysical methods was suitable to survey the hydro-geological characteristics of debris landslides in the Wenchuan earthquake area. ...|$|R

Eight additional individuals were patch tested with irritating chemicals (sodium lauryl sulfate or nonanoic acid) and with a vehicle control for 48 h. Epidermal cells, isolated from suction blisters, were double labeled for CD 1 /HLA-DR, CD 3 /HLA-DR, or CD 36 /HLA-DR cell surface markers and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the percentage of various cell populations. A mean increase of 0. 91 ± 0. 3 {{in the percentage of}} DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells over the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> was detected in allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> in allergic individuals, whereas a decrease of 0. 19 ± 0. 2 in the percentage of DR+CD 1 + Langerhans cells from the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> was detected in irritant-treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> Epidermal cells from allergen-positive patch <b>test</b> <b>sites</b> also exhibited an increase of 5. 2 ± 1. 8 in percentage of DR+CD 1 - cells over the vehicle control patch <b>test</b> <b>site</b> compared to an increase change of 0. 8 ± 0. 4 in epidermal cells isolated from irritant-treated patch <b>test</b> <b>sites.</b> We also found that DR+ cells that lacked the CD 1 determinant expressed the macrophage/monocyte antigen CD 36 (OKM 5).
