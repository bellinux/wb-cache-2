60|$|Had the {{character}} of Ellen Langton's mind been different, there might, perhaps, have been danger to her from an intercourse of this nature with such a being as Fanshawe; for he was distinguished by many of those asperities around which a woman's affection will often cling. But she was formed {{to walk in the}} calm and quiet paths of life, and to pluck the flowers of happiness from the wayside where they grow. Singularity of character, therefore, was not calculated to win her love. She undoubtedly felt an interest in the solitary student, and perceiving, with no great exercise of vanity, that her society drew him from the destructive intensity of his studies, she perhaps felt it a <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> her <b>influence.</b> But it did not occur to her that her influence had been sufficiently strong to change the whole current of his thoughts and feelings.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} has been to {{investigate}} what kind of space there is <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>influence</b> for adult persons with mild intellectual disabilities who live on group housing. We wanted to investigate what kind of hindrance and possibilities there were <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>influence</b> for people on group housing. Our study has been built on qualitative group discussions with 9 persons with mild intellectual disabilities and 6 care-keepers. We have analysed our discussions {{on the basis of}} the theory of empowerment. Our result indicates that there is different kind of factors that affect the possibilities for people with mild intellectual disabilities to increase their influence, and it does not always have to do with the disability how the persons can make their voices heard. Economy was one of the facts that were common for our informers own statements. The support from the care-keepers also seemed to have a big importance to enable possibilities for the persons with intellectual disabilities <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>influence...</b>|$|R

30|$|Because of {{all these}} changes, port {{activity}} goes beyond the five basic activities identified by the UNCTAD in 1992. Namely: i) cargo planning; ii) its storage; iii) its receipt and delivery; iv) ship operations; and v) quay operations. As Drewe and Janssen (1996) (among others) highlighted, ports became nodes in logistics chains. That implies new challenges for the port governance. New and more specialised services integrated in complex logistics chains are expected. Following Verhoeven (2009), that means port managers ought to promote: i) a sustainable development of port activity; ii) the port’s integration into logistic chains; and iii) the development of market strategies for port management. Vanoutrive (2012) considers that there are basically three challenges to port governance: firstly, he suggests that managers must be able <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>influence</b> on the ports. As the ports shift from places to nodes in logistic chains, it is increasingly difficult <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> that <b>influence</b> because the management of those chains surpasses their competencies. Secondly, there are no citizens in the ports. Therefore, {{there is a lack}} of agents upon which <b>to</b> <b>exert</b> <b>influence.</b> Thirdly, the environmental impact of port activity must be taken into account.|$|R
