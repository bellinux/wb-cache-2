5000|$|Hornpipes {{are made}} of a single reed, a small {{diameter}} melody pipe with fingerholes, and a bell traditionally made of animal horn. An animal <b>horn</b> <b>reed</b> cap usually encompasses the idioglot reed. These instruments are descended from single-reed idioglot instruments found in Egypt as early as 2700 BCE. [...] During the Old Kingdom in Egypt (2778-2723 BCE), memets were depicted on the reliefs of seven tombs at Saqqarra, six tombs at Giza, and the pyramids of Queen Khentkaus. [...] Horns were later added to the reed pipe to increase resonance. Horn caps were also added around the reed, and the player would blow into the hornpipe to activate the reed instead of holding it in their mouth.|$|E
40|$|The English horn has persevered as {{a popular}} solo {{instrument}} by the many composers who have written for it since its inception {{as a member of}} the oboe family at the Court of Louis XIV in the seventeenth century. While modern English horn popularity and performance practice continues to flourish through new literature, master classes, and recordings, a review of the existing literature reveals that there is a need for an informative guide for advanced, college-level oboists who wish to begin doubling on the English horn. The present study is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource for the novice English hornist who seeks pedagogical advice on the development of specialized performance techniques, along with a discussion on the significant differences between the oboe and English horn, specialized English <b>horn</b> <b>reed</b> makingtools and supplies, and procedures for making and finishing long-scrape English horn reeds. Additionally, this study includes a brief history of the English horn and a discography of selected English horn recordings. Finally, a discussion of selected etudes from A. M. R. Barret's Forty Progressive Melodies and W. Ferling's 48 Famous Studies and correlating symphonic English horn excerpts concludes the study...|$|E

50|$|His entire {{recorded}} output for Victor {{is highly}} collected and appreciated as prime examples of late 1920s jazz. His style of jazz was {{comparable to the}} sophisticated style of Jelly Roll Morton. Parham favored the violin {{and a number of}} his records have surprisingly sophisticated violin solos, along with the typical upfront tuba, <b>horns</b> and <b>reeds.</b> Parham wrote most, if not all, of his own material.|$|R
50|$|Eastern-style polka {{is similar}} to Chicago style but is played at a faster tempo, usually {{includes}} a bigger section of <b>horns</b> and <b>reeds,</b> and is connected to big-band era music rather than rock-and-roll. The most popular Eastern-style performer (and probably the most popular polka artist in America today) is Jimmy Sturr, winner of 15 Grammy Awards in the polka category. Other important Eastern-style performers include Frank Wojnarowski, Bernie Witkowski, and the Connecticut Twins.|$|R
50|$|The double reed woodwinds, the oboe and bassoon, have no mouthpiece. Instead {{the reed}} is {{two pieces of}} cane {{extending}} from a metal tube (oboe - staple) or placed on a bocal (bassoon, English <b>horn).</b> The <b>reed</b> is placed directly on the lips and then played like the double-lip embouchure described above. Compared to the single reed woodwinds, the reed is very small and subtle changes in the embouchure can have a dramatic effect on tuning, tone and pitch control.|$|R
50|$|A Daboll trumpet is an air trumpet foghorn {{which was}} {{developed}} by an American, Celadon Leeds Daboll, of New London, Connecticut. It was basically a small coal-fired hot air engine, which compressed air in a cylinder on top {{of which was a}} <b>reed</b> <b>horn.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Basque alboka (albogue), is a single-reed woodwind {{instrument}} {{consisting of}} a single reed, two small diameter melody pipes with finger holes and a bell traditionally made from animal <b>horn.</b> Additionally, a <b>reed</b> cap of animal horn is placed around the reed to contain the breath and allow circular breathing for constant play.|$|R
50|$|The nyele {{is a small}} horn {{made from}} {{hollowed}} out animal <b>horn</b> or matete <b>reed.</b> The nyele is played in groups; one man plays one note and others play different pitches, which combine to form a certain combination of sounds. Traditionally, the nyele were played along with the budima drums at funerals of the so-called Valley Tonga in Zambia.|$|R
50|$|The {{orchestra}} accompanies an eighth-note heavy piano part as {{the piece}} modulates from C minor to C major. A calm, flowing A-major section, {{ending with a}} call-and-response section between double <b>reeds,</b> <b>horn,</b> and piano, leads into the Marcia, an F-major variation on the main theme in march style. A reprise of the instrumental theme from the first Allegro transitions into the choral entrance.|$|R
5000|$|The gyaling (also spelled gya ling, gya-ling, jahlin, jah-lin, jahling, jah-ling, Rgya-gling etc.) Gyaling {{literally}} meaning [...] "Indian trumpet" [...] is {{a traditional}} woodwind instrument used in Tibet. Specifically, it is a double <b>reed</b> <b>horn</b> much like the sorna used mainly in Tibetan monasteries during puja (chanting and prayer) and is associated with peaceful deities {{and the idea of}} devotion.|$|R
50|$|In 1937, a 125-foot steel radiobeacon {{tower was}} {{installed}} and the <b>reed</b> <b>horn</b> fog signal {{replaced with a}} diaphragm over the next decade. In 1939 the United States Coast Guard replaced the U.S. Lighthouse Service as the agency responsible for maintaining the light but a civilian light keeper remained on site until November 1973 {{and was replaced by}} the Coast Guard. Before Joseph Hindley retired, he may have been the last civilian light keeper in New England.|$|R
50|$|In mixed martial arts, an {{air horn}} is {{commonly}} used to signal {{the end of a}} round as opposed to the bell used in boxing and professional wrestling. For outdoor activities like hiking, hunting, cross-country skiing, canoeing, fishing, an air horn can be handy to frighten away unwanted or aggressive wildlife, signalling for help and to announce one's location. Bicyclists occasionally use this type of horn, since it yields a louder warning sound than traditional bicycle bells or bulb <b>reed</b> <b>horns.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Rushing was a {{powerful}} singer who had a range from baritone to tenor. He could project his voice so that it soared over the <b>horn</b> and <b>reed</b> sections in a big-band setting. Basie claimed that Rushing [...] "never had an equal" [...] as a blues vocalist, though Rushing [...] "really {{thought of himself as}} a ballad singer." [...] George Frazier, the author of Harvard Blues, called Rushing's distinctive voice [...] "a magnificent gargle". Dave Brubeck defined Rushing's status among blues singers as [...] "the daddy of them all." [...] Late in his life Rushing said of his singing style, [...] "I don't know what kind of blues singer you'd call me. I just sing 'em." [...] Among his best-known recordings are [...] "Going to Chicago", with Basie, and [...] "Harvard Blues", with a famous saxophone solo by Don Byas.|$|R
5000|$|Larry Chesky (born November 17, 1933, died January 25, 2011, Holyoke, MA) was a Polka band {{leader and}} manager of the Polka record label Rex Records. He was {{inducted}} into the International Polka Association Hall of Fame in 1985, having recorded over 100 record albums. He was a proponent of the [...] "Big Band" [...] or [...] "Eastern" [...] style of Polka, which features more band members (greater than ten), and a focus on <b>horn</b> and <b>reed</b> instruments, than the typical Polka band. Jimmy Sturr, the 18 time Grammy Award Winner for Best Polka Album, said of him: [...] "He was one of my idols. I grew up on him...I modeled my band after his Eastern style." [...] Lenny Gomulka, the twelve time Polka Grammy Nominee, said that Larry Chesky was a [...] "pioneer who changed and enhanced the image of polka to the Big Band sound." ...|$|R
50|$|An {{air horn}} is a {{pneumatic}} device {{designed to create}} an extremely loud noise for signaling purposes. It usually consists of a source which produces compressed air, which passes into a <b>horn</b> through a <b>reed</b> or diaphragm. The stream of air causes the reed or diaphragm to vibrate, creating sound waves, and the horn amplifies the sound so it is louder. Air horns are widely employed as vehicle horns, installed on large semi-trailer trucks, fire trucks, trains, and some ambulances as a warning device, and on ships as a signaling device.|$|R
5000|$|The hornpipe {{can refer}} to a {{specific}} instrument or a class of woodwind instruments consisting of a single reed, a small diameter melody pipe with finger holes and a bell traditionally made from animal <b>horn.</b> Additionally, a <b>reed</b> cap of animal horn may be placed around the reed to contain the breath and allow circular breathing for constant play, although {{in many cases the}} reed is placed directly in the mouth. It was also known as the pibcorn, pibgorn, or piccorn. One rare Scottish example, called the stock-and-horn, is referred to by Robert Burns among others. Other hornpipes include the Spanish gaita gastoreña, the Basque alboka and the Eastern European zhaleika. When joined with a bag, Baines refers to the instruments as [...] "bag-hornpipes".|$|R
2500|$|Wills added {{a trumpet}} {{to the band}} {{inadvertently}} when he hired Everet Stover as an announcer, not knowing that he had played with the New Orleans symphony and had directed the governor's band in Austin. Stover, thinking he had been hired as a trumpeter, began playing with the band with no comment from Wills. Young sax player Zeb McNally was allowed {{to play with the}} band, although Wills initially discouraged it. With two horns in the band, Wills realized he would have to add a drummer to balance things and create a fuller sound. He hired the young, [...] "modern style musician" [...] Smoky Dacus. By 1935, Wills had added <b>horn</b> and <b>reed</b> players as well as drums to the Playboys. The addition of steel guitar whiz Leon McAuliffe in March 1935 added not only a formidable instrumentalist but a second engaging vocalist. Wills himself largely sang blues and sentimental ballads. Wills and the Texas Playboys did their first recordings on September 23–25, 1935 in Dallas, Texas, being produced by Don Law and Art Satherley of the American Record Corporation. There is strong evidence that the 1935 sessions took place at 508 Park Avenue along with sessions in 1937 and 1938.|$|R
50|$|Accompanied by Bass (Acoustic and Electric), Cello, Horn, Keyboard (x3), Percussion (x2), Reed 1 (Alto Flute & Flute), <b>Reed</b> 2 (English <b>Horn</b> & Oboe), <b>Reed</b> 3 (Alto Saxophone, Bass Clarinet, & Clarinet), Reed 4 (Bassoon, Contrabassoon), Trombone, Trumpet, Viola, Violin (x2). The {{character}} of Emma sings with notes ranging from Bb to Eb (2 octaves above), while Lucy sings with notes ranging from Bb to F (2 octaves above). While the two utilize a similar span of notes, {{the way in}} which they sing alters how these notes sound. As mentioned, the timbre differs between the two women, reflecting their pasts and, perhaps most importantly, their class status, with Emma being the daughter of a knighted man and Lucy being a prostitute in the local brothel, The Red Rat.|$|R
5000|$|... "Tian Dan {{collected}} {{more than}} one thousand oxen from {{the people in the}} city. He had them dressed with red silk, and had multicolour lines, like those of dragons, painted on them. Sharp blades were adjusted to their <b>horns,</b> and <b>reeds</b> dipped in grease, so that their tips could be set aflame, were attached to their tails. Several passages were dug in the city walls, and on one night, the oxen were released, followed by five thousand sturdy men. The oxen, their tail on fire, charged the army of Yan, creating panic. The torches attached to the tails illuminated the night, the troops of Yan saw the lines on their bodies, which looked like dragons, and all those who met their horns were either killed or wounded. Then, the five thousand men, their mouths closed with pieces of wood, attacked them. They were followed by the sound of shouts and drums from the city, and all the old people and children struck metal pots. The noise shook heaven and earth. The soldiers of Yan panicked. They were defeated and repealed, and the people of Qi killed his general, Ji Jie. As the army of Yan was falling back, in disorder and confusion, the soldiers of Qi chased it, and destroyed it as they pushed it northwards. All the cities it went through revolted, and rallied Tian Dan, whose troops were larger every day. As he fled from a victory to another, the army of Yan was defeated every day, and finally reached the northern bank of the Yellow River. At this time, more than seventy cities had returned back to Qi." ...|$|R
50|$|Several {{advances}} in the technology of fog signals were made during the 1850s. In 1851, an experimental air fog whistle and <b>reed</b> <b>horn</b> was installed at Beavertail Lighthouse {{at the entrance to}} Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. At first this sound signal was powered by a horse-operated treadmill and later by an internal combustion steam engine. Around 1851, mechanically rung fog bells were introduced. The striking mechanism was governed by a weight attached to a flywheel, and later internally run by clockworks. The strokes of the fog signals were timed deliberately to afford each signal a unique sound characteristic. The bell signal was gradually replaced by three variations of that instrument. The first was an ordinary locomotive whistle, enlarged and modified and blown by steam from a high-pressured tubular boiler. The second was a reed-trumpet, and in 1866 the third variation, a siren-trumpet. Although the fog bell signal was still used for warning vessels over short distances, other fog signals started to supersede the smaller bell signal. Bells were also used on buoys; later whistling buoys were invented by J. M. Courtenay and were first in use in 1876. The first gas-lighted buoy was installed in 1882. The gong buoy was invented in 1923.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel was}} made into an opera that premiered at San Francisco's War Memorial Opera House and was {{performed}} by the San Francisco Opera on September 13, 2008. The opera was composed by Stewart Wallace, and the libretto penned by Amy Tan. The opera condenses the novel's plot through various devices: it omits peripheral characters and the subplot about the Christian orphanage and expands Chang the Coffin Maker into the key villain. He rapes Precious Auntie after killing her father, the Bonesetter, and unknowingly fathers Lu Ling. The score folds traditional Chinese brass and percussion into a Western orchestra, with Chinese classical musicians led by Wu Tong and Li Zhonghua performing at the premiere. The suona, a raucous <b>reed</b> <b>horn,</b> features in the orchestration and is played onstage several times. The character of Precious Auntie sings and moves in the kunju style of Chinese Opera and was created and enacted by kunju star Qian Yi at the premiere. The {{other members of the}} premiere cast included mezzo-soprano Zheng Cao singing the dual roles of Ruth and the youthful Liu Ling, mezzo-soprano Ning Liang as Old Lu Ling, bass Hao Jiang Tian as Chang, folk/pop vocalist and suona player Wu Tong as the Taoist priest, baritone James Maddalena as Ruth's husband, Art Kamen, mezzo-soprano Catherine Cook as Art's mother Arlene Kamen and as Madame Wang in the flashback to Immortal Heart village, bass-baritone Valery Portnov as Art's father, Marty Kamen, with 14-year-old Madelaine Matej and 17-year-old Rose Frazier, respectively, playing Art's teen daughters, Dory and Fia Kamen. Chang's wives were played by Mary Finch, Natasha Ramirez Leland, and Erin Neff. The Dalian Acrobatic Troupe performed aerial and floor stunts and played numerous supernumerary roles alongside the San Francisco Opera Chorus. The premiere was directed by Chen Shi-Zheng and conducted by Steven Sloane.|$|R
