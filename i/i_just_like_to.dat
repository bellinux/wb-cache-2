500|$|In November 2009, the New York Post interviewed former Scientologist Mandy Mullen, who {{had joined}} the Manhattan {{organization}} in 2008 after seeing information on 4chan about Chanology protests. Over the next year, she recalled cases of members being coerced into donating more and more money. When she told her [...] "leader" [...] that she had looked at websites run by anti-Scientology protesters (and disagreed with them), he reportedly replied [...] "That's like saying I don't burn niggers, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> party with the KKK!" [...] In Fall 2008 Mullen left the church, joining a group of Chanology protesters across the street. Church of Scientology Manhattan President John Carmichael issued a response the following week, stating [...] "Mandy Mullen's story about Scientology... is all lies {{in the service of}} Anonymous, a hate group that targets our Church, or even anyone who just falls onto their radar." [...] On November 13, 2009, Independent Australian Senator Nick Xenophon used parliamentary privilege to accuse the Church of Scientology of being a criminal organisation.|$|E
500|$|Similar {{to other}} artists that the {{director}} have worked with, Rolston usually brought his team of professionals along to the shooting, including make-up artist, wardrobe-hair stylist, dancers and choreographer. However, Rolston and his team turned out to cause a few creative conflicts with the group during production. One of them came from the original routine conducted by Watkins, {{the person who was}} in fact choreographed most of the group's early videos. She remembered Rolston's camp's choreographer Frank Gatson Jr. [...] "locked" [...] the girls out from providing ideas as they were practicing the new dance moves. The trio eventually dropped his choreograph because they thought his version wasn't their [...] "style of dancing." [...] But still, two of his moves were adapted in the final clip. [...] "To me, I didn't even think about, 'Well, can I really choreograph?' I was just like, 'Let me do my thing.' <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> dance and I know when I like what I see. I like different kinds of stuff," [...] Watkins shared. The [...] "bend-down-and-jump-up" [...] dance that appears in the video was made up by Watkins to [...] "Foe Life", a song of Mack 10, the rapper whom she later married from 2000 to 2004.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} with Billy Johnson, Jr. of Yahoo! Music in 2003, Mýa stated, [...] "I like to sing loud, I like to sing soft, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> feel good, period. It's not that serious." [...] She also commented on the fact {{there are a lot}} of misconceptions about singing: ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I’m very competitive. You know, I’m one to work harder. Maybe not {{a natural}} athlete, but a {{hard-working}} athlete with the will to win. I wouldn’t say I was a bad athlete. I was pretty good, but I don’t think I was, like, great at all sports. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>liked</b> <b>to</b> do them." ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{recording}} of [...] "Sympathy for the Devil", {{as well as}} tension between him and Rose, led Slash to quit the band officially in October 1996. Rose sent a fax notifying MTV of Slash's departure, with Slash responding [...] "Axl and I have not been capable of seeing eye to eye on Guns N' Roses for some time. We tried to collaborate, but at this point, I'm {{no longer in the}} band." [...] Slash also stated, [...] "Axl's whole visionary style, as far as his input in Guns N' Roses, is completely different from mine. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play guitar, write a good riff, go out there and play, as opposed to presenting an image." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{frequently}} {{being considered}} {{as part of}} the gothic rock genre, Sain did not view the music as such, though he did credit its listeners with discovering many noteworthy bands: [...] "Goth is an important doorway for lots of things that would not be accepted easily anywhere else. For example, who were the first people to embrace the Sugarcubes? Goths. And now we have a megastar of Björk. Pixies 1988? Gothic audience, not fratboys. Einsturzende Neubaten walked in through the [...] "gothic" [...] door—Miranda Sex Garden—Cocteau Twins. It's no wonder nobody can agree on what [...] "Gothic" [...] means... depth and dissonance and polite confrontationalism are quite possibly the only denominators.... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> play interesting music. It just so happens to be the 'goths' who are listening." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, CSI {{executive}} producer Anthony Zuiker began casting for the then-unnamed Miami based spin-off. First cast was Emily Procter, as Calleigh Duquesne. Regarding {{her decision to}} leave The West Wing and join Miami, Procter stated that [...] "It was like choosing between a boyfriend that {{wants to be with}} you casually or a man that says I love you." [...] She described her character as [...] "a weird girl [...] bright and very nerdy. She wears a lot of boot-cut corduroy pants and turquoise necklaces and looks like a hippie. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> pretend I'm Velma in Scooby-Doo." [...] Adam Rodriguez, Rory Cochrane, and Khandi Alexander were cast alongside Procter, completing the supporting ensemble. For the lead, CBS suggested David Caruso. Zuiker, who stated that he had [...] "heard about the NYPD Blue thing," [...] was initially hesitant. Elaborating, Zuiker stated that he [...] "sort of jumped in and said, 'Naw, I don't know about this guy. The show's tough enough to get off the ground and I don't want to walk into any problems." [...] CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet [...] "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started to look at our options as to who was going to play Horatio, [...] revisited Caruso. And [...] said, 'Yeah, we'll have him come out for dinner, see what he's about.'" [...] Caruso was later cast as Caine. He was the last pilot cast member to be contracted to series.|$|E

6000|$|... "There, there, <b>I</b> should <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{know who}} can be cross {{with you when you}} put on those ways. Are your feet wet? Ah! I thought so. Run on in and take them off." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "He's a lemon, if {{ever there}} was one," [...] was what Andy said after his {{punishment}} had come to an end. [...] "Oh, wouldn't <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> get square with him!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "O, you've {{been having}} a good cry, I know! <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> go off {{and have a good}} cry that way. It makes your eyes red, but you can fix that. Just sit still now and let me see what I can do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Aileen Wuornos [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> would <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> say I'm sailing {{with the}} rock, and I'll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus. June 6, like the movie. Big mother ship and all, I'll be back, I'll be back." ...|$|R

5000|$|Nastasia later {{expressed}} some {{dissatisfaction with}} the album, stating that [...] "some of those songs I felt like I really wanted to hear how they would have sounded on record with a full band. I mean, I like how they turned out, but I've played some of those songs with a full band since record was released, and <b>I</b> <b>just...</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>like</b> <b>to</b> re-record a song. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> feel <b>like</b> <b>I</b> should write another one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my! but wouldn't <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> land on old Crabtree!" [...] muttered Tom. [...] "I think I'd be apt {{to put him}} in the {{hospital}} first and jail afterwards! He certainly deserves it-- for all the trouble he has caused us and our-- er-- friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! the old places {{bring them}} back again. I have been recollecting how it used to seem to me the depth of my fall that you were marrying me out of pure pity, without my having the spirit to resent or prevent it, and now <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> think how kind and noble it was in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What are ye sittin' there for, ye old idiot?" [...] said he savagely. [...] "I do b'lieve ye've larned {{to sleep}} on the donkey. Ha! there's two of ye together, an' the wooden one's the best. Wouldn't <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be yer leftenant, my boy? an' I'd come to know why you don't go on your beat.

6000|$|... "But it has {{the stage}} to itself," [...] Villa urged. [...] "Besides, if it is painful, then we can go out. I'll go out with you. But <b>I</b> <b>just</b> would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see how much better Jerry sings than does he. And it says an Irish terrier, too." ...|$|R

5000|$|He {{started working}} on his debut album after the tour, then {{tentatively}} titled Come Right Back to You, which he said will be a mix of both rock, soul/R&B.

5000|$|Lyrically, [...] "I'll Be Back" [...] {{consists}} of singer and protagonist [...] "Arnee" [...] informing the listener that [...] "it's not that I'm ill-mannered or a psychopathic hater, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be treated right like any Terminator" [...] before driving home the central message that [...] "you don't need [...] "please" [...] or [...] "thank you", {{you just need}} [...] "I'll be back"".
