40|$|Finnraccoons (Nyctereutes procyonoides ussuriensis) are farmed {{for their}} fur. The welfare of Finnraccoons {{in the current}} housing {{conditions}} has not been thorough documented. The aim {{of the present study}} is to measure the juvenile Finnraccoons’ interaction with a commonly used activity object, namely bovine cortical bone. The subjects of the study were 16 sister pairs of juvenile Finnraccoons (born in May) housed in commercial housing conditions. The behaviour of the Finnraccoons was recorded and the interaction with the bone was registered from video recordings in two time points; at the time when the deciduous teeth are being replaced with the permanent ones (September), and later in autumn (November). In order to evaluate how much the Finnraccoons value the access to the bone, the effect of two-weeks deprivation of the bone was recorded in half of the animals (8 pairs of Finnraccoons) in both time points. The duration and frequency of various types of interactions with the bone were continuously recorded for 15 mins from each hour of the day and statistically analysed by using Linear Mixed Model (SAS). The <b>Finnraccoon</b> pairs interacted with the bone a mean from 2 to 8 % of time. The time (month) did not affect the interaction with the bone, but both the percentage of time and frequency of the interaction with the bone increased after the deprivation treatments (after returning the access to the bone) in the Finnraccoons deprived of the bone. Oral activities were the most frequent activities with the bone, but oral activity combined with the use of paws was the longest duration interaction with the bone. The interaction with the bone was not randomly distributed throughout the day, but was most intense in early morning. The present results show that the Finnraccoons interact regularly with a bovine cortical bone, and they do not lost interest towards the bone with time. The bone induces various behaviours and provides a long lasting, biologically and behaviourally relevant activity object in the <b>Finnraccoon.</b> Bone is a significant environmental enrichment in the <b>Finnraccoon...</b>|$|E
40|$|The <b>Finnraccoon</b> (Nyctereutes procyonoides ussuriensis) is an {{important}} fur animal in Finland. The aim {{of the present study}} was to examine whether the housing conditions affect the fur quality and the selling price of the pelt in juvenile Finnraccoons. A total of 152 Finnraccoons were raised from weaning until pelting in four different housing conditions, differing in the cage size, animal density, group size and furnishing of the cage. The length and quality of the fur were evaluated and the selling price was registered. The data were analysed by using the Pearson Chi- square test and Linear Mixed Model (SPSS). The fur quality differed between groups with the poorest quality in the group of four animals housed in an enriched cage. No general difference between males and females was found. No difference between groups was found in the distribution of the pelts into the size categories. The size category and the quality of the fur were the main factors determining the selling price of the pelt. The selling price was higher in pelts of males than in those of females. This difference between males and females appeared only in the Finnraccoons housed in pairs, and not in those housed in groups. When only the auction where the majority of pelts were sold was considered, the selling price of the pelt was higher in females when housed in larger cages instead of small cages and in enriched cages instead of barren cages. In conclusion, the larger cage size and increased complexity of the cage may increase the selling price of pelts in juvenile Finnraccoons, especially in females. Although, the increased cage complexity impairs the quality of the fur, this does not finally affect the selling price of the pelt...|$|E
40|$|A {{new type}} of pyoderma was {{detected}} in Finnish fur animals in 2007. The disease continues to spread within and between farms, with severe and potentially fatal symptoms. It compromises animal welfare and causes considerable economic losses to farmers. A case-control study was performed in 2010 – 2011 to describe the entity and to identify the causative agent. Altogether 99 fur animals were necropsied followed by pathological and microbiological examination. The data indicated that the disease clinically manifests in mink (Neovison vison) by necrotic dermatitis of the feet and facial skin. In <b>finnraccoons</b> (Nyctereutes procyonoides), it causes painful abscesses in the paws. Foxes (Vulpes lagopus) are affected by severe conjunctivitis and the infection rapidly spreads to the eyelids and facial skin. A common finding at necropsy was necrotic pyoderma. Microbiological analysis revealed {{the presence of a}} number of potential causative agents, including a novel Streptococcus sp. The common finding from all diseased animals of all species was Arcanobacterium phocae. This bacterium has previously been isolated from marine mammals with skin lesions {{but this is the first}} report of A. phocae isolated in fur animals with pyoderma. The results obtained from this study implicate A. phocae as a potential causative pathogen of fu...|$|R
40|$|Fur Animal Epidemic Necrotic Pyoderma (FENP) is a severe, often lethal {{infectious}} disease affecting all three fur animal species: mink (Neovision vision), foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and <b>finnraccoons</b> (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Previous studies showed {{an association between}} Arcanobacterium phocae and FENP. An experimental infection was conducted to confirm the ability of A. phocae to infect mink either alone or concurrently with a novel Streptococcus sp. found together with A. phocae in many cases of FENP. Different inoculation methods were tested to study possible routes of transmission. Typical signs, and gross- and histopathological findings for FENP were detected when naïve mink were infected with the tissue extract of mink with FENP, using a subcutaneous/ intradermal infection route. Edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and pus formation were detected in the infection site. A pure culture preparation of A. phocae alone or concurrently with the novel Streptococcus sp. caused severe acute signs of lethargy, apathy and anorexia and even mortality. The histopathological findings {{were similar to those}} found in naturally occurring cases of FENP. In contrast, the perorally infected mink presented no clinical signs nor any gross- or histopathological lesions. This study showed that A. phocae is able to cause FENP. The study also indicated that predisposing factors such as the environment, the general condition of the animals, temperature and skin trauma {{contribute to the development of}} the disease...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In 2007, a {{previously}} unrecorded disease, fur animal epidemic necrotic pyoderma (FENP), was detected in farmed mink (Neovision vision), foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and <b>Finnraccoons</b> (Nyctereutes procyonoides) in Finland. Symptoms included severe pyoderma with increased mortality, causing both animal welfare problems and economic losses. In 2011, an epidemiologic questionnaire {{was mailed to}} {{all members of the}} Finnish Fur Breeders’ Association to assess the occurrence of FENP from 2009 through the first 6  months of 2011. The aim was to describe the geographical distribution and detailed clinical signs of FENP, as well as sources of infection and potential risk factors for the disease. Results A total of 239 farmers (25 %) returned the questionnaire. Clinical signs of FENP were observed in 40 % (95 % CI 34 – 46 %) of the study farms. In addition, the survey clarified the specific clinical signs for different animal species. The presence of disease was associated with the importation of mink, especially from Denmark (OR 9. 3, 95 % CI 2. 6 – 33. 0). The transmission route between Finnish farms was associated with fur animal purchases. Some risk factors such as the farm type were also indicated. As such, FENP was detected more commonly on farms with more than one species of fur animal in comparison to farms with, for example, only foxes (OR 4. 6, 95 % CI 2. 4 – 8. 6), and the incidence was higher on farms with over 750 breeder mink compared to smaller farms (OR 3. 8, 95 % CI 1. 6 – 9. 0). Contact between fur animals and birds and other wildlife increased the risk of FENP on farms. Responses also indicated that blocking the entry of wildlife to the animal premises protected against FENP. Conclusions FENP was most likely introduced to Finland by imported mink and spread further within the country via domestically purchased fur animals. Some potential risk factors, such as the type and size of the farm and contact with wildlife, contributed to the spread of FENP. Escape-proof shelter buildings block the entry of wildlife, thus protecting fur animals against FENP...|$|R
