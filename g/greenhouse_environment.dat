5000|$|The genus Xiphinema are ectoparasitic root {{nematodes}} {{commonly known}} as dagger nematodes. The genus is of economic importance on grape, strawberry, hops {{and a few other}} crops. Major species include X.americanum, X.diversicaudatum, X.index, X.italiae and X.pachtaicum. They can be easily recognized by their long bodies and stylets which are long enough to reach the vascular tissue of plants. Different members of the genus have been shown to induce moderate to large amounts of root damage through root penetration, which in some species results in the formation of galls. They are of agricultural concern because they are vectors of nepoviruses, transferring them during feeding. [...] Efforts to study these nematodes in more detail have proved problematic in some species due to difficulties in maintaining populations in a <b>greenhouse</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E

40|$|Mathematical models which {{describe}} the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>environment,</b> {{and the growth}} of a crop of cucumbers, in that environment, have be en developed and tested. The models have been used to predict: the response of the greenhouse to varying weather conditions, the growth of the crop leaf canopy, and the weight and number of fruit harvested The <b>greenhouse</b> <b>environment</b> has been modelled using a system of non-linear differential equations, derived from a consideration of the energy and mass balances of the glazing, internal structure, crop canopy, root media, fl oor, deep soil layers, and the greenhouse air space. The equations have been solved for five minute time steps, using measured values of outside weather conditions and control inputs as boundary values. Entry of solar radiation into the greenhouse, and absorption by various surfaces, has been determined using transmission tables generated using a "ray-tracing" light transmission model. The light transmission model has been calibrated in a separate experiment. The incoming solar radiation has been partitioned between diffuse, direct, photosynthetically active and near infra-red radiation, for use in the crop model. Validation experiments have been performed to test the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>environment</b> simulation model. The results of the validation exercise showed that the model was capable of predicting the temperatures in the greenhouse, within a few degrees. The mean errors were smaller for the crop canopy, root medium, and floor, than for the glazing or air temperature. Prediction errors for relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentration were more variable. An existing model of cucumber development rate, and leaf expansion, has been modified and validated. This gave good results when adequate account was taken of leaf senescense, and initiation of lateral growths. Sub-models for photosynthesis, respiration, and assimilate partitioning have been develope d, and c ombined with the <b>greenhouse</b> <b>environment</b> and leaf expansion models. The combined model has been used to predict the course of growth of a cucumber crop over one growing season, and the number and weight of fruit harvested. The predictions have been compared to results from a test crop. This revealed that while the total number of fruit harvested was accurately predicted, the total weight of harvested fruit was not.

A <b>greenhouse</b> spectral <b>environment</b> supplemented with fluorescent lamps was also used to culture wheat. All. four spectral envi ronments were used to culture wheat to maturity separately. The activities of phenylalanine and tyrosine ammonia-lyase were photoinduced in wheat tissue obtained from plants grown in the metal halide, high -pressure sodium and <b>greenhouse</b> spectral <b>environments.</b> These enzyme activities are the committed catalytic step in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and were induced in wheat tissue by fluences {{of light in the}} ultraviolet and blue regions of the spectrum. The low-pressure sodium lamp, which does not provide strong irradiance in these wavelengths, produced significantly lower ammonia-lyase activities than were observed in wheat grown within the metal halide, high-pressure sodium, or <b>greenhouse</b> spectral <b>environments.</b> These effects were not caused by phytochrome, since calculation of PfrfPtotal for the low-pressure sodium lamp was higher than the ratio obtained from metal halide or high-pressure sodium lamps. Lignin was also significantly reduced in wheat grown with low-pressure sodium lamps. Several essentialamino acids were in lower molar concentration in protein from wheat grown under low-pressure sodium lamps.

Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB) is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Infection by Fusarium graminearum affects yield and grain quality traits {{that can lead}} to substantial economic losses. Developing resistant cultivars has been a major objective of plant breeders for controlling FHB. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess FHB resistance in the Japanese landrace, PI 81791 (Sapporo Haru Komugi Jugo), a line that does not possess the widely used Fhb 1 QTL for type II resistance. A population of 150 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between this genotype and the susceptible variety, Wheaton, and was assessed for several resistance-related traits, including type I and II resistance, post-harvest grain traits, and agronomic traits in four field environments in Minnesota. Type II resistance was also assessed in two <b>greenhouse</b> <b>environments.</b> The RILs were genotyped using 377 microsatellite markers. Composite interval mapping detected QTL for resistance traits on chromosomes 2 B, 3 A, 3 B, 3 D, 4 A, 4 D, 5 A, 5 B and 6 A and for heading date and height on 1 B, 2 D, 3 B and 4 D. The resistance QTL on chromosomes 2 B, 3 B, and 3 D explain the largest amount of variation observed for many of the resistance traits analyzed with alleles being inherited from PI 81791. The QTL on chromosome 3 B in the interval of Xbarc 229 – Xgwm 383 b appears to be a major novel resistance locus that explains 7 – 21 % of the variation observed for various resistance traits. Similar QTL regions to those on chromosome 2 B in the interval of Xgwm 639 b – Xwmc 339 and chromosome 3 D in the interval of Xwmc 533 a – Xwmc 656 have been previously reported, supporting their use for FHB resistance breeding. Major resistance QTL were also identified on chromosomes 4 A, associated with Xbarc 233, and 4 D, which is associated with the semi-dwarfing gene, Rht-D 1. However, these QTL are likely associated with increased susceptibility from PI 81791 and Wheaton, respectively. Additional type II resistance QTL were identified on 3 A in <b>greenhouse</b> <b>environments,</b> explaining as much as 23. 2 and 15. 8 % of the phenotypic variation observed...|$|R

However, many discoveries were initially made in the controlled conditions of greenhouses or laboratories, not in the field.

Critically, a drought experiment utilizing small pots in the greenhouse elicited nearly identical physiological changes as an experiment conducted in the field, but an order of magnitude more differentially expressed genes. However, we were able to define a suite of several hundred genes that were differentially expressed across all experiments.

Specific hypotheses were tested related to the varieties’ drought and nutrient fertilisation responses for NUE components, and coherence of those responses in field and greenhouse. METHODS: The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivated varieties ‘Diskett’, ‘Granary’, ‘Quarna’, ‘Stilett’, ‘Vinjett’, and a Swedish landrace (‘Dala’) were grown in field and <b>greenhouse</b> <b>environments</b> in Central Sweden. Two fertilisation treatments were included in a field and greenhouse experiment, and in the greenhouse also drought. The NUE components N uptake efficiency (UN), grain-specific N efficiency (EN,g) and grain N concentration (CN,g) were assessed. RESULTS: Drought reduced yield and NUE through EN,g, and more so when drought occurred prior to anthesis than after anthesis. Effect of fertilisation treatment on NUE components was similar in the two set-ups, but there were fewer variety x fertilisation interactions in the field. UN was higher {{in the field and}} EN,g was higher in the greenhouse, while CN,g and overall NUE were similar in the two environments. Ranking of varieties regarding NUE and UN was similar in the greenhouse and field, but different regarding EN,g and CN,g.
