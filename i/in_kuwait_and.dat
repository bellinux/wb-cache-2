5|$|In {{accordance}} with his ideology, Arafat generally {{refused to accept}} donations to his organization from major Arab governments, in order to act independently of them. He {{did not want to}} alienate them, and sought their undivided support by avoiding ideological alliances. However, to establish the groundwork for Fatah's future financial support, he enlisted contributions from the many wealthy Palestinians working <b>in</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, such as Qatar (where he met Mahmoud Abbas in 1961). These businessmen and oil workers contributed generously to the Fatah organization. Arafat continued this process in other Arab countries, such as Libya and Syria.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, Fluor {{built the}} first all-hydrogen {{refinery}} <b>in</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> the first exclusively offshore power plant for the Atlantic Richfield Company. It also constructed pumps and ports for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, which traversed 800 miles from northern Alaska to Valdez, Alaska, and the world's largest offshore facility for natural gas {{on the island of}} Java in Indonesia. In 1976, it was awarded a $5 billion project for ARAMCO in Saudi Arabia, to design facilities that capture sour gas, which is expelled from oil wells as waste, in order to refine it into fuel. That same year a partially completed copper and cobalt mine in Africa was cancelled due to a war in the neighboring region of Angola and declining copper prices. In 1979, Fluor had 13 projects for building United States power plants and had served {{more than half of the}} world's government-owned oil companies.|$|E
5|$|The Genesis was {{the first}} Sega console to receive {{third-party}} versions. Its first variants were released before any Master System variants, even though the Genesis was released {{three years after the}} Master System. Working with Sega Enterprises, JVC released the Wondermega, a Mega Drive and Mega CD combination with high quality audio, in Japan on April 1, 1992. The system was later redesigned by JVC and released as the X'Eye in North America in September 1994. A Pioneer LaserActive add-on pack, developed by Sega, allows the system to play Genesis and Sega CD games. Aiwa released the CSD-GM1, a combination Genesis/Sega CD unit built into a boombox. Several companies added the Genesis to personal computers, mimicking the design of Sega's TeraDrive; these include the MSX models AX-330 and AX-990 distributed <b>in</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> Yemen, and the Amstrad Mega PC distributed in Europe and Australia. After the Genesis was discontinued, Majesco Entertainment released the Genesis 3 in North America as a budget version of the console in 1998. Majesco also released a budget version of the Sega Pico in North America in August 1999.|$|E

5|$|The {{final two}} co-productions of the 1970s, both made in 1979, {{occurred}} <b>in</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> Spain. The Kuwaiti show, Iftah Ya Simsim, which ran until 1990, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Arab world. It used Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and was broadcast in 22 Arab countries. The show continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air. It returned in 2013, and had similar goals and objectives as the original version, including the use of MSA. Barrio Sésamo, made in Spain, featured a snail character who was able to hide a thousand and one things in her shell. One of the show's Muppet characters, Dr. Valentin Ruster, was based upon Dr. Valentin Fuster, a native Spaniard who worked at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Dr. Fuster's likeness was created to educate children in Spain about exercise and eating healthy.|$|E

25|$|During the Persian {{siege of}} Basra in 1775–79, Iraqi merchants took refuge <b>in</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> were partly {{instrumental}} in the expansion of Kuwait's boat-building and trading activities. As a result, Kuwait's maritime commerce boomed, as the Indian trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople were diverted to Kuwait during this time. The East India Company was diverted to Kuwait in 1792. The East India Company secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India and the east coasts of Africa. After the Persians withdrew from Basra in 1779, Kuwait continued to attract trade away from Basra.|$|E

The battalion provided communications to over 40,000 permanent subscribers <b>in</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> to 150,000 subscribers during the 2005 surge operations. The 63rd served as the force provider headquarters for all signal infrastructure projects across Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan providing the command and control of an additional seven signal companies to meet these requirements.

25|$|Following Turkey's {{decision}} to deny any official {{use of its}} territory, the Coalition was forced to modify the planned simultaneous attack from north and south. Special Operations forces from the CIA and U.S. Army managed to build and lead the Kurdish Peshmerga into an effective force and assault for the North. The primary bases for the invasion were <b>in</b> <b>Kuwait</b> <b>and</b> other Persian Gulf nations. One result of this was {{that one of the}} divisions intended for the invasion was forced to relocate and was unable {{to take part in the}} invasion until well into the war. Many observers felt that the Coalition devoted sufficient numbers of troops to the invasion, but too many were withdrawn after it ended, and that the failure to occupy cities put them at a major disadvantage in achieving security and order throughout the country when local support failed to meet expectations.|$|E
