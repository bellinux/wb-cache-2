5|$|As {{he builds}} this army to attack Superior Spider-Man, Norman {{takes on the}} new alias of the Goblin King. The Hand ninjas who evaded capture arrive at the sewers and join up with Goblin King's Goblin Underground. The group revels in the news that, thanks to Superior Spider-Man's assault, the Goblin King now owns over the half of New York's {{organized}} crime. He claims he now owns New York City as the Goblin Kingpin of Crime. With the help of Menace, the Goblin King later releases Phil Urich from a prison transport, and upgrades Urich's Goblin armor and weapons. Goblin King asks in return only that Urich dedicate his only identity <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> as the Goblin Knight. Goblin King trains Goblin Knight, anxious to confront Superior Spider-Man. Goblin King later poses as Hobgoblin and is sighted {{by some of the}} Spiderlings.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} modern NY350 that {{overlaps}} with NY31F was originally designated {{as part of}} Route20, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. Route20 continued east <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> what is now NY31 and west on current NY31F. On March1, 1921, Route20 was altered to follow modern NY31 and NY250 between Macedon and Fairport, bypassing current NY350 entirely. Even though {{it was no longer}} part of a legislative route, the Macedon–Cator Corners highway was taken over by the state of New York by 1926. At the time, it was the only portion of what is now NY350 that was state-maintained.|$|E
5|$|There {{were far}} less goals {{scored in the}} replay at Arsenal Stadium. After a snow flurry, the ground was left muddy and the play was mostly limited to long balls. Brain hit the post in the first half, with was then {{followed}} by the only goal of the game came shortly afterwards following a run by Buchan into the Port Vale box. <b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>on,</b> Arsenal {{did not have to}} leave London at all in the competition. In the following round, they defeated Liverpool by two goals to nil, the same scoreline seen in the league earlier in the season. This was Liverpool's first defeat of the year. Both the goals came as a result of indirect free kicks in rapid succession. First a header by Brain, then another by Buchan which the goalkeeper could only clear after it had crossed the line.|$|E

Upon his passing away, his sons, Nizar the older, and Al-Musta'li, the younger, fought for political and spiritual control of the dynasty. Nizar was defeated and jailed, but according to Nizari tradition, his son escaped to Alamut, where the Iranian Ismaili had accepted his claim. <b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>on,</b> the Nizari Ismaili community has continued with a present, living Imam.|$|E

25|$|There {{was greater}} {{difference}} between these than name: the French government of the day had grown suspicious of the supranational power of the High Authority and sought to curb its powers in favour of the intergovernmental style Council. Hence the Council had a greater executive role in {{the running of the}} EEC than was the situation in the ECSC. By virtue of the Merger Treaty in 1967, the executives of the ECSC and Euratom were merged with that of the EEC, creating a single institutional structure governing the three separate Communities. <b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>on,</b> the term European Communities were used for the institutions (for example, from Commission of the European Economic Community to the Commission of the European Communities).|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} game of the third round of the {{qualifying}} matches held in England, Haifa's Gustavo Boccoli scored on the 29th minute an advantage that lasted just four minutes. Craig Bellamy evened the score and in front of 40,000 local fans, Haifa stood bravely up to the 88th minute when Mark Gonzales scored the winning goal for the hosts. Due to the security situation in Israel, the return match was not held in Ramat Gan but in Kiev, Ukraine, at the Valery Lobanovsky stadium, with 1,700 spectators. The game ended in a 1–1 tie. The last twenty minutes of the game were stressful for Rafa Benitez's players. Indeed, the giant Peter Crouch gave his team the advantage (54) and an away goal, but Roberto Colautti (63) tied the score and <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> the movement towards the host's goalpost became one-sided.

25|$|Reversible addition-fragmentation chain {{transfer}} or RAFT polymerization {{is one of}} several kinds of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. It makes use of a {{chain transfer}} agent {{in the form of a}} thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, <b>from</b> <b>here</b> <b>on</b> referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and polydispersity during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization {{is one of several}} living or controlled radical polymerization techniques, others being atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled radical polymerization techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low dispersity (molecular weight distribution) and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked networks.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880 season, Derbyshire's first {{match of}} the season was against the touring Australians, fresh in their {{existence}} as a Test nation and with several young players at their disposal. The Derbyshire bowling pair of Mycroft and Hay dealt soundly with the Australians, but then the same treatment was dealt to the Derbyshire team in a second-innings eight-wicket haul by Fred Spofforth. Hay then played four more non-status games against the Australians – for a scratch Derbyshire team, for Keighley and twice for Wermeth, maintaining his duel with Spofforth who was later to become a Derbyshire captain. Hay appeared in eight county matches for the team during 1880, scoring more runs in this season {{than in any other}} of his career. The 1881 season was nearly as successful a season, Hay playing in six county matches, Derbyshire winning two. <b>From</b> <b>here</b> <b>on,</b> Hay was on the playing staff of MCC where he played matches against minor counties, while still putting in five games for Derbyshire over the next five years. His two final first-class matches were in teams made up of a variety of players from all the major cricketing counties.|$|E
