For 222 bulls, combined US-Canadian <b>evaluations</b> and <b>evaluations</b> from the US only from January 1993 for milk, fat, and protein yields were compared with their US only <b>evaluations</b> from August 1997.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{programme}} evaluations {{have found that}} many resettled refugees have been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in the UK. The Home Office's 2009 <b>evaluation</b> notes that between one-quarter and half of each of four groups of Liberian and Congolese refugees resettled under the programme had suffered verbal or physical harassment. An <b>evaluation</b> undertaken by academics at Sheffield Hallam University for the Home Office in 2011 found that one-fifth of the refugees surveyed for the <b>evaluation</b> (who {{had been in the}} UK for a year) had been the victims of verbal or physical attacks in their first six months in the UK, and just over a fifth had been attacked in the second six months of their resettlement. Many of the victims of this abuse had not reported it to the authorities, and the authors of the <b>evaluation</b> suggest that this is a reason why there was a gap between the perceptions of refugee and service providers, who generally suggested that community relations were good. Verbal and physical attacks against refugees were also noted in the 2013 Motherwell <b>evaluation.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine to what extent two types of <b>evaluations</b> are similar: course <b>evaluations</b> by {{students}} and that by the teacher for the same class. Seventy-nine students who took a particular class and the teacher of the class were required to evaluate each lecture throughout one semester. The results showed that there was a difference between the variances of students' <b>evaluations</b> and the variances of the teacher's <b>evaluations</b> over the semester. However, the tendencies of both <b>evaluations</b> were similar for many individual lectures. Furthermore, a significant correlation was found between the two types of <b>evaluations.</b> These findings indicate that course <b>evaluations</b> by the students might be generally analogous to the <b>evaluations</b> by the class's teacher...|$|R
