5|$|Despite the boasting of Mussolini and {{the fury}} of Churchill, the loss of Tug Argan and {{consequently}} Somaliland was not of the greatest strategic importance. Certainly it was a blow to British prestige and pride, but Somaliland was one of Britain's lesser regions of value and could be affordably lost. In fact, Britain incurred monetary gains after being relieved of the necessity to station an expensive garrison there. But the impact could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> greater if the Italians had managed to move faster after the battle. Heavy rains and difficulties supplying the troops damaged these efforts, as well as removed any chance of a sizable strategic victory.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{difficulties}} William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o' nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted {{to improve the}} standard of naval gunnery and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process that might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more costly {{if he had not}} learnt before becoming King that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{approach to}} the house would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more impressive than the picturesque approach today. The east front was then the entrance façade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading, which with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{commentators}} consider Staunton's {{understanding of}} positional play to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> {{ahead of his}} contemporaries'. Although not an all-out attacking player, he attacked when his preparations were complete. His chess articles and books were widely read and encouraged the development of chess in the United Kingdom, and his Chess-Player's Handbook (1847) was a reference for decades. The chess openings the English Opening and Staunton Gambit were named for his advocacy of them. Staunton has been a controversial figure since his own time, and his chess writings could be spiteful. On the other hand, he maintained good working relationships with several strong players and influential chess enthusiasts, and demonstrated excellent management skills.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 1/2 May, most of the {{remnants}} of the Berlin garrison attempted {{to break out of the}} city centre in three different directions. Only those that went west through the Tiergarten and crossed the Charlottenbrücke (a bridge over the Havel) into Spandau succeeded in breaching Soviet lines. Only a handful of those who survived the initial breakout made it to the lines of the Western Allies—most were either killed or captured by the Red Army's outer encirclement forces west of the city. Early in the morning of 2 May, the Soviets captured the Reich Chancellery. The military historian Antony Beevor points out that as most of the German combat troops had left the area in the breakouts the night before, the resistance must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> less than it had been inside the Reichstag. General Weidling surrendered with his staff at 06:00 hours. He was taken to see General Vasily Chuikov at 08:23. Weidling agreed to order the city's defenders to surrender to the Soviets. Under General Chuikov's and Vasily Sokolovsky's direction, Weidling put his order to surrender in writing.|$|E
5|$|Other {{attempts}} to start rival leagues <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> less successful. The World Football League (WFL) played for two seasons, in 1974 and 1975, but faced monetary issues {{so severe that}} the league could not pay its players. In its second and final season the WFL attempted to establish a stable credit rating, but the league disbanded before its second season could be completed. The United States Football League (USFL) operated for three seasons from 1983 to 1985 but collapsed due to poor business decisions and monetary problems. A subsequent USD $1.5billion antitrust lawsuit against the NFL was successful in court, but the league was awarded only three dollars in damages. The XFL was created in 2001 by Vince McMahon and lasted for only one season. Despite television contracts with NBC and UPN and high expectations, the XFL suffered from poor television ratings and a low quality of play. The United Football League (UFL) began in 2009, but folded after suspending its 2012 season, due to financial issues.|$|E

25|$|Unlike in vivo MRS {{which is}} intensively used in {{clinical}} settings, fMRS is used {{primarily as a}} research tool, both in a clinical context, for example, to study metabolite dynamics in patients suffering from epilepsy, migraine and dyslexia, and to study healthy brains. fMRS {{can be used to}} study metabolism dynamics also {{in other parts of the}} body, for example, in muscles and heart; however, brain studies <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more popular.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} {{forces of}} the federates would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> greater in number than Aetius' own Roman army, which had become much smaller by this time. Assuming that the Hunnic and Germanic forces were roughly {{the same size as}} the Roman and federate army, those involved in the battle could be in excess of 100,000 combatants in total. This excludes the inevitable servants and camp followers who usually escape mention in the primary sources.|$|E

25|$|In {{frontier}} provinces, {{the proportion}} of citizens would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> smaller. For example, one estimate puts Roman citizens in Britain c.

In the empire as a whole, we know there were just over 6 million Roman citizens in AD 47, the last quinquennial Roman census return extant. This was just 9% of a total imperial population generally estimated at c. 70 million at that time.|$|E

The Worcestershire bowlers shared out the wickets, and Somerset were in real trouble at 57 for 5, but Suppiah stayed calm and the lower order made good contributions. Nadeem Malik got the best figures for Worcestershire, with three for 63.|$|E

25|$|However, {{there are}} major {{problems}} with this story. First, the Yongzheng Emperor's eldest surviving son, Hongshi, was only seven when Hongli was born, far too young to make the drastic choice of replacing a child of imperial birth with an outsider (and risking disgrace if not death). Second, the Yongzheng Emperor had three other princes who survived to adulthood and {{had the potential to}} ascend the throne.

25|$|A July 2010 {{paper by}} Moody's Investors Service's chief {{economist}} Mark Zandl and former Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder {{predicted that the}} US recession would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> worse without the government intervention. They calculate that {{in the absence of}} both a monetary and fiscal response, unemployment would have peaked at about 16.5% instead of about 10%, the peak to trough GDP decline would have been about 12% instead of 4%. Despite the lack of deficit spending, without the intervention the 2010 and 2011 US federal budget deficit was forecast to be almost two times larger, due to the predicted collapse of tax receipts.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposal}} {{was published in}} the Journal of the Royal United Services Institute and {{a couple of years later}} a shorter article suggested that if the Soviets themselves had used SMAs in swarms in Afghanistan their COIN operations against the Mujaheddin would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>far</b> more successful. Contemporary Western armies in Afghanistan can readily accept that swarming at the tactical and operational levels is appropriate, but the physical structure of the country rules out the currently available fighting vehicles. However, networked and swarming SMAs, again 5,000 in number, all armed with laser designators for the second echelon of conventional ground attack aircraft, would constitute force multipliers with a substantial impact.|$|E
