50|$|The poem portrays Orc and his three-stage cycle, whose stages are {{connected}} to historical events, although the latter are removed in The Four Zoas. In the beginning is the fall of Urizen, the Satanic force, {{in a similar way}} to Milton's Satan. Creation, however, was the fall. Urizen is the representation of abstraction, which is a passive and mental <b>force</b> <b>disconnected</b> from reality. Los, in the fallen world, enters the world as the fire of imaginative energy. However, he too falls and becomes mechanical and regular. Los is the creator of life systems and of the sexes, which leads to the creation of his partner Enitharmon. Eventually, human forms are created and Orc is born as an evolution of life.|$|R

40|$|Definitive erythropoiesis {{occurs in}} the bone marrow or fetal liver, where erythroblasts are {{associated}} with a cen-tral macrophage in units called “erythroblastic islands ” (1). Late in erythropoiesis, nuclei are expelled from the eryth-roid precursors and engulfed by macrophages in the islands (2). To investigate the mechanism behind the enucleation, we isolated erythroblasts from the spleens of phlebotomized mice. When these erythroblasts were cultured, nuclei spontane-ously protruded from erythroblasts. A weak physical <b>force</b> could <b>disconnect</b> the nuclei from reticulocytes.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedCloud computing {{is emerging as}} the mainstream platform {{for a range of}} on-demand applications, services, and infrastructure. Before the benefits of cloud computing are realized, several technology challenges must be addressed. Operating in intermittent and austere network conditions is one of such challenges, which navy ships face when communicating with land-based cloud computing environments. Given limited bandwidth and intermittent connectivity of satellite connections, mechanisms are needed to support data requirements of navy ships. Data caching and pre-fetching can be useful in such conditions. Caches act as temporary local storage and can satisfy data requests readily, if requested data is available. They promote faster response time and reduce bandwidth utilization. Cloudlets have the capability to bring the cloud closer to the users when they are deployed, as they extend the reachability of cloud-based servers to the users. In this research, we study the application of these two mitigating strategies in detail and evaluate their performance through modeling and simulation. Results from our simulations have suggested a positive impact. Caches and cloudlets as part of the shipboard architecture produce better performance in data communications. Most importantly, the strategies promote operations continuity for a naval <b>force</b> under <b>disconnected,</b> intermittent, and limited network environments.

40|$|Mobile {{computing}} {{has enabled}} users to seamlessly access databases {{even when they}} are on the move. However, in the absence of readily available high-quality communication, users are often <b>forced</b> to operate <b>disconnected</b> from the network. As a result, software applications have to be redesigned {{to take advantage of this}} environment while accommodating the new challenges posed by mobility. In particular, there is a need for replication and synchronization services in order to guarantee availability of data and functionality, (including updates) in disconnected mode. To this end we propose a scalable and highly available data replication and management service. The proposed replication technique is compared with a baseline replication technique and shown to exhibit high availability, fault tolerance and minimal access times of the data and services, which are very important in an environment with low-quality communication links. <br /...|$|R

40|$|The Aceh {{province}} in Indonesia, located around the Sumatra subduction area, {{was one of}} the worst hit areas with respect to damage from the impact of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. A 9. 15 Mw earthquake triggered the tsunami. One of the impacts was the disconnection of several areas from their mainland, thus creating new small islands. This happened around Ujong Seudeun village in Aceh Jaya District. Prior to the tsunami, the village had approximately 500 residents. However, after the tsunami, the area was severely eroded and a small strait had been inserted between the village and the Sumatra Island mainland. This study investigates the magnitude of the tsunami wave forces that separated the area to yield a newly deserted small island. This study was conducted by numerical simulations and by coupling the COMCOT (Cornell Multi-grid Coupled Tsunami Model) and Delft 3 D models. These tools have specific advantages, namely, COMCOT’s linear modeling is based on a series of earthquake mechanisms and Delft 3 D uses non-linear morphological dynamic modeling. Their software includes the explicit leapfrog finite difference scheme (COMCOT) and the non-linear shallow water equation (Delft 3 D). Bathymetry data fromnewly formed coastline and the small island’s shape were digitized using 2005 Quickbird Images. Results from this research reveal the estimated tsunami wave heights and <b>forces</b> that <b>disconnected</b> the small island of Ujong Seuden from the Sumatra Island mainland. These results can be used to further develop the COMCOT model to incorporate sediment modules...|$|R

The rate of progress in the biological sciences and biotechnology is extraordinary.

A priori, one would expect that the rapid rate of scientific progress would create an intellectual gold rush that would attract the Abest and brightest @ young Americans to the biological sciences and reward them with good career prospects. Instead, the field faces a Acrisis of expectations @ among new entrants (NRC, 1998) because Ait is increasingly difficult for new scientists to establish independent research careers @ 1.

40|$|This {{research}} investigates how Trinidadian {{students in}} the United Kingdom (UK) respond to their new environment. The research explores and conceptualises the participants' experiences in the UK. It investigates Trinidadian student adjustment in the UK from a postcolonial perspective. To acquire data on Trinidadian experiences in the UK I created a private, password-protected group blog (interactive webpage) where eight respondents interacted and shared aspects of their everyday life and experiences over six months. After the blogging period follow-up face-to-face individual {{interviews were conducted with}} five of the eight participants. The research design was formulated so that the two methods would work together to paint a vivid, multidimensional and dynamic picture of the participants' experiences. These two techniques together are referred to as the blog-interview method. The experiences of three of the participants were captured as in-depth case studies. Grounded Theory was used to analyze the data and generate a working theory of the participants' experiences. A theory of adjustment, called (dis) juncture, was developed. The theory views the students' adjustment as a continuous process of negotiation among simultaneous connecting and <b>disconnecting</b> <b>forces.</b> This can create a student who is a synergy of global experiences, signifying systems, representations, identities, worldviews and perspectives that are not exclusively in one domain: they are hybrid. Unlike much work in this area, (dis) juncture does not view adjustment in stages nor does it assume that adjustment is something that can be achieved. Adjustment is advanced as a process of continuous transformation as a result of constant contact with multiple signifying systems simultaneously. (Dis) Juncture breaks important ground in the field by reconceptualising and re-imaging the process of international student adjustment. The theory thus makes a significant contribution to research on international student experiencesEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
5000|$|Shirky {{introduces}} the Gin Craze as an older {{version of a}} modern-day concern. Gin offered its consumers the ability to fall apart {{a little bit at}} a time. He relates this to how society today deals with free time in relation to technology. Since the Second World War, increases in GDP, educational attainment, and life span have forced industrialized world to grapple with something we'd never had to deal with on a national scale: free time. He claims that the sitcom, along with other technology and social media, has become the modern day Gin Craze. Something that makes today remarkable is that we can treat free time as a general social asset that can be harnessed for large, communally created projects. Society never knows what to do with a surplus at first (hence “surplus”). The [...] "Milkshake Mistake" [...] is the idea that {{it is a mistake to}} look at the meaning of or potential of something by looking at the history and original purpose of a product (such as drinking milkshakes for breakfast). Shirky says we do this when thinking about media. The use of technology is much less determined by the tool/medium itself; when we use a network, the most important asset we get is access to one another. Ushahidi was one of the first examples of a program in response to this surplus of free time being used for a greater good (cognitive surplus). It was a service developed to help citizens track outbreaks of ethnic violence in Kenya. It grew to a bigger and better at reporting over a wide geographical area as a result of cognitive surplus. It brought people together to carve out enough collective good-will from the community to create resources that no one could have imagined years ago. Along with good-will acts, people with a surplus of free time also engage in the use of creativity ( [...] ICanHasCheezburger). Cognitive surplus, newly <b>forced</b> from previously <b>disconnected</b> island of time and talent, is just raw material. To get any value out of it, Shirky says, we have to make it mean something or be useful. We collectively aren't just a source of the surplus; we are also the people designing its use by our participation and by the things we expect of one another as we wrestle together with our new connectedness.|$|R
