500|$|The opening chorus, [...] "" [...] (Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> {{to trouble}} yourself), is a chorale fantasia, with the vocal part {{embedded}} {{in an independent}} concerto of the instruments.

500|$|Since 533, the new {{pope has}} also decided on his regnal name. Pope John II {{was the first}} to adopt a new papal name; he felt that his {{original}} name, Mercurius, was inappropriate, as it was also the name of a Roman god. In most cases, even if such considerations are absent, popes tend to choose papal names different from their baptismal names; the last pope to reign under his baptismal name was Pope Marcellus II (1555). After the newly elected pope accepts his election, the Cardinal Dean asks him about his papal name, saying in Latin: [...] "Quo nomine vis vocari? (By what name <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to be called?)" [...] After the papal name is chosen, the officials are readmitted to the conclave, and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Ceremonies writes a document recording the acceptance and the new name of the pope.|$|E

However when asked in 1990 [...] "Looking back, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> that you had made a stronger effort to protest or demonstrate against the Vietnam War, or not?" [...] Twenty-five percent wished they had.|$|E

Everyone present at the meeting advised Sun Quan to surrender and welcome Cao Cao; only Lu Su remained silent. When Sun Quan left the meeting for a change of clothes, Lu Su hurriedly left his seat and followed his lord. Sun Quan understood Lu Su's intention, so he held Lu Su's hand and asked, [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to tell me?" [...] Lu Su replied, [...] Sun Quan sighed and said, [...] "I'm very disappointed with what those gentlemen said. Your thoughts are exactly the same as mine. This is a sign that Heaven has granted you to me." ...|$|E

[...] "He's below; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to see him?" [...] "I do, sir." [...] The captain, who was then below, on being called, asked what he wanted, to which he answered, [...] "Why do you wear that penant, sir?" [...] "Because my country allows me to, sir."

2500|$|In 1965, {{together}} with Ratu Kamisese Mara, {{and other organizations}} opposed to the Federation Party, {{he was involved in}} the formation of Fiji's first multi-racial political party, the Alliance Party. He joined the Alliance Party independently of Ayodhya Prasad's National Congress of Fiji and worked himself to a position of influence within the Party by taking up the posts of Treasurer and Publicity Manager. When the Congress was wound up in 1967, its members joined the Indian division of the Alliance Party, the Indian Alliance, with Vijay R. Singh as President. In the 1966 election, {{he was elected to the}} Legislative Council from the East-Central cross-voting seat which covered Vanua Levu and Lau. The Federation Party had no hope of winning the seat and to confuse voters selected another Vijay Singh. From then on he started to use the name, Vijay R. Singh (Vijay Raghubar Singh - using his father's first name as his middle name.) The ploy by the Federation Party backfired, as Vijay R. Singh's opponent was a clerk and he asked the electorate, [...] "Which Vijay Singh <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to vote for - the clerk or the lawyer?" ...|$|E
