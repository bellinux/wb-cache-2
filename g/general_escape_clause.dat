The most important {{law in this}} area is the Rome II Regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations that applies since 11 January 2009. The Regulation creates a common regime of conflict of law rules for most civil and commercial non-contractual obligations. The general rule is the law of the place of injury (lex loci damni). The rule is subject to two exceptions, the common habitual residence exception and a <b>general</b> <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> based on the closer connection principle. Special rules are laid down for some non-contractual obligations, such as product liability, unfair competition and acts restricting free competition, environmental damages, infringement of intellectual property rights, unjust enrichment, negotiorum gestio and culpa in contrahendo. However, in most cases, the parties may agree on the law applicable to the non- contractual obligations between them. Post-tort agreements may be made between all parties whereas pre-tort agreements are allowed only where all the parties are pursuing commercial activity. Where the Rome II Regulation does not apply the courts will look to the relevant national legislation, which is the Private [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Based on the {{decision}} to file an <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> petition by a firm, a Poisson regression model of the macroeconomic determinants {{of the total number}} of these petitions yearly is developed and estimated. The Poisson specification conforms to the fact that the number of <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> petitions is a non-negative integer with a skewed probability distribution. In addition, the number of potential petitioners is controlled for in the specification. The empirical results suggest that both domestic and international factors affect {{the decision}} to file an <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> petition. The legal environment is found to be a determinant as well. Copyright 1989 by MIT Press. ...|$|R

When the Russian Super League was disbanded in favour of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) in 2008, he signed a new four-year contract to replace the original deal that also had an NHL <b>escape</b> <b>clause.</b> He joined Spartak in 2008-09 as the youngest player in the KHL and appeared in ten regular season and playoff games. During the season, the KHL unilaterally revoked his NHL <b>escape</b> <b>clause.</b> His playing rights were sold to Salavat Yulaev Ufa, which required a new contract be signed under KHL rules. Ufa refused to grant him another <b>escape</b> <b>clause,</b> and Kabanov refused to sign a new contract. In the meantime, he was selected by the Moncton Wildcats of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the seventh overall selection in the Canadian Hockey League Import Draft.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to provide a}} game theoretic rationale {{for the inclusion of}} <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> mechanisms in trade agreements, by examining the effects of uncertain outcomes on the sustainability of cooperation in an infinitely repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma tariff setting game. Since, in the presence of uncertainty affecting the outcome under cooperation, deviations and thus the breakdown of cooperation may occur, it is necessary to design an agreement such that cooperation can be sustained under all contingencies. The introduction of an <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> that allows a shock-affected country to temporarily deviate, while sufficiently compensating its trading partner in order to alleviate the loss from being ex-posed to the deviation, offers such a possibility. It is shown that with such a mechanism cooperative behavior can always be sus-tained. Moreover, the expected per-period payoff increases as compared to the case when there is no <b>escape</b> <b>clause.</b> For a suf-ficiently high discount factor, the threshold level for temporary deviation through the <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> will be at the efficient level. It is shown that, when the optimal compensation cost can be ap-plied, the optimal cooperative is strictly smaller than the optimal cooperative tariff in the absence of uncertainty. Furthermore it is shown that a decrease in the cooperative tariff unambiguously leads to an increase {{in the use of the}} <b>escape</b> <b>clause.</b> ∗Institute for International Economic Studies, Stockholm University, August 2003 †This paper is a draft of what will be the first essay of my dissertation.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the design and}} implementation of international trade agreements when: (i) negotiations are undertaken and commitments made {{in the presence of}} uncertainty about future political pressures; (ii) governments possess private information about political pressures {{at the time that the}} agreement is actually implemented; and (iii) negotiated commitments can be implemented only if they are self-enforcing. We thus {{consider the}} design of self-enforcing trade agreements among governments that acquire private information over time. In this context, we provide equilibrium interpretations of GATT/WTO negotiations regarding upper bounds on applied tariffs and GATT/WTO <b>escape</b> <b>clauses.</b> We also provide a novel interpretation of a feature of the WTO Safeguard Agreement, under which <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> actions cannot be re-imposed in an industry for a period equal to the duration of the most recent <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> action. We find that a dynamic usage constraint of this kind can raise the expected welfare of negotiating governments. *Bagwell: Columbia University (Kelvin J.

40|$|The {{reach and}} scope of the <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> found in article 4. 5 of the Rome Convention has been {{fiercely}} debated in the last years. The main participants in this debate held either a rigid conception of the <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> that regarded it as applicable only in exceptional cases; or the opposing viewpoint, which can be described as a flexible interpretation, according to which judges may dismiss presumptions at any moment whenever they deem that there is one law with more links to the contract. The Rome I Regulation on the law applicable to international contracts, aware of the many problems posed by the aforementioned article, has introduced some important modifications concerning the regulated issue. This article intends to examine the modifications of the exception clause found in the Rome I Regulation by studying the multiple problems in case-law related to the <b>escape</b> <b>clause</b> of the Rome Convention, with the purpose of ascertaining the scope of its changes and its possible use by judges of States parties...|$|R
