500|$|Having {{criticized the}} idea that {{semantic}} evaluation concerns only the internal relations between the units of a symbolic system, Fodor can adopt an externalist position with respect to mental content and meaning. For Fodor, in recent years, the problem of naturalization of the mental {{is tied to the}} possibility of giving [...] "the sufficient conditions for which a piece of the world is relative to (expresses, represents, is true of) another piece" [...] in non-intentional and non-semantic terms. If this <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> achieved within a representational theory of the mind, then the challenge is to devise a causal theory which can establish the interpretation of the primitive non-logical symbols of the LOT. Fodor's initial proposal is that what determines that the symbol for [...] "water" [...] in Mentalese expresses the property H2O is that the occurrences of that symbol are in certain causal relations with water. The intuitive version of this causal theory is what Fodor calls the [...] "Crude Causal Theory". According to this theory, the occurrences of symbols express the properties which are the causes of their occurrence. The term [...] "horse", for example, says of a horse that it is a horse. In order to do this, it is necessary and sufficient that certain properties of an occurrence of the symbol [...] "horse" [...] be in a law-like relation with certain properties which determine that something is an occurrence of horse.|$|E

2500|$|Ubuntu's <b>goal</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> secure [...] "out-of-the box". By default, the user's {{programs}} {{run with}} low privileges and cannot corrupt {{the operating system}} or other users' files. For increased security, the sudo tool is used to assign temporary privileges for performing administrative tasks, which allows the root account to remain locked and helps prevent inexperienced users from inadvertently making catastrophic system changes or opening security holes. PolicyKit is also being widely implemented into the desktop. Most network ports are closed by default to prevent hacking. A built-in firewall allows end-users who install network servers to control access. A GUI (GUI for Uncomplicated Firewall) is available to configure it. Ubuntu compiles its packages using GCC features such as PIE and buffer overflow protection to harden its software. These extra features greatly increase security at the performance expense of 1% in 32-bit and 0.01% in 64-bit.|$|E
