500|$|Seeing {{little sign}} of an {{increase}} in production capacity at Ashford, Maunsell decided to construct the prototype N1 locomotive from parts intended for use on the next Nclass locomotive in the batch, No.822. The outside cylinders were exchanged for the N1 type, which had been machined at the GWR's Swindon railway works following casting at Ashford to quicken construction once the Nclass frames were modified to accept the new design of cylinder block. This produced a robust chassis capable of supporting both sets of Walschaerts and the Holcroft conjugated valve gear. The latter was provided with <b>grease-gun</b> lubrication points to ease maintenance.|$|E
40|$|High-pressure {{injection}} gun (<b>Grease-gun)</b> injuries mainly {{occur with}} industrial labourers. Injuries {{associated with high}} pressure grease guns are very rare and frequently involve the hand and chest. The non-dominant hand is generally injured since the grease gun is usually held in the dominant hand. Even if high-pressure injection injury causes only a small lesion in the skin, it is still characterized by severe damage to subcutaneous tissue. Since initial presentation may be deceptive, treatment is frequently delayed. The characteristics of the material injected need {{to be known as}} a priority, and systemic intoxication must be ruled out. The risk of amputation is 16 - 55 %. With solvents it goes up to 50 - 80 %. Surgical treatment must be performed immediately, under general anesthesia or plexus block. Foreign material and necrotic tissue must be early debrided with wide microsurgical exploration. Positive outcomes in reacquisition of hand functions can be obtained with long-term and early physiotherapy...|$|E
