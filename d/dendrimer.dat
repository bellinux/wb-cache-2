500|$|Morpholinos do not {{trigger the}} {{degradation}} of their target RNA molecules, unlike many antisense structural types (e.g., phosphorothioates, siRNA). Instead, Morpholinos act by [...] "steric blocking", binding to a target sequence within an RNA, inhibiting molecules that might otherwise interact with the RNA. Morpholino oligos are often used to investigate {{the role of a}} specific mRNA transcript in an embryo. Developmental biologists inject Morpholino oligos into eggs or embryos of zebrafish, African clawed frog (Xenopus), sea urchin and killifish (F. heteroclitus) producing morphant embryos, or electroporate Morpholinos into chick embryos at later development stages. With appropriate cytosolic delivery systems, Morpholinos are effective in cell culture. Vivo-Morpholinos, in which the oligo is covalently linked to a delivery <b>dendrimer,</b> enter cells when administered systemically in adult animals.|$|E
500|$|Delivery into adult tissues {{is usually}} difficult, {{though there are}} a few systems {{allowing}} useful uptake of unmodified Morpholino oligos (including uptake into muscle cells with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or the vascular endothelial cells stressed during balloon angioplasty). Though they permeate through intercellular spaces in tissues effectively, unconjugated PMOs have limited distribution into the cytosol and nuclear spaces within healthy tissues following IV administration. Systemic delivery into many cells in adult organisms can be accomplished by using covalent conjugates of Morpholino oligos with cell-penetrating peptides, and, while toxicity has been associated with moderate doses of the peptide conjugates, they have been used in vivo for effective oligo delivery at doses below those causing observed toxicity. An octa-guanidinium <b>dendrimer</b> attached {{to the end of a}} Morpholino can deliver the modified oligo (called a Vivo-Morpholino) from the blood to the cytosol. [...] Delivery-enabled Morpholinos, such as peptide conjugates and Vivo-Morpholinos, show promise as therapeutics for viral and genetic diseases.|$|E
50|$|Dendrimers {{are also}} {{classified}} by generation, {{which refers to}} the number of repeated branching cycles that are performed during its synthesis. For example, if a <b>dendrimer</b> is made by convergent synthesis (see below), and the branching reactions are performed onto the core molecule three times, the resulting <b>dendrimer</b> is considered a third generation <b>dendrimer.</b> Each successive generation results in a <b>dendrimer</b> roughly twice the molecular weight of the previous generation. Higher generation dendrimers also have more exposed functional groups on the surface, which can later be used to customize the <b>dendrimer</b> for a given application.|$|E
50|$|Ferrocene-containing <b>dendrimers</b> are of {{interest}} {{for their ability to}} do multielectron-transfers and they have been synthesized by convergent and divergent approaches. There are three basic categories that ferrocene-containing <b>dendrimers</b> can be placed in: (a) <b>dendrimers</b> with ferrocene cores, (b) <b>dendrimers</b> with peripheral ferrocene groups, and (c) <b>dendrimers</b> with ferrocene at the core and the peripheral.|$|R
40|$|<b>Dendrimers</b> {{are highly}} {{customizable}} nanopolymers with qualities {{that make them}} ideal for drug delivery. The high binding affinity of biotin/avidin provides a useful approach to fluorescently label synthesized dendrimer-conjugates in cells and tissues. In addition, biotin may facilitate delivery of <b>dendrimers</b> through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) via carrier-mediated endocytosis. The purpose {{of this research was}} to: (1) measure toxicity using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays of generation (G) 4 biotinylated and non-biotinylated poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) <b>dendrimers</b> in a co-culture model of the BBB, (2) determine distribution of <b>dendrimers</b> in the rat brain, kidney, and liver following systemic administration of <b>dendrimers,</b> and (3) conduct atomic force microscopy (AFM) on rat brain sections following systemic administration of <b>dendrimers.</b> LDH measurements showed that biotinylated <b>dendrimers</b> were toxic to cell co-culture after 48 h of treatment. Distribution studies showed evidence of biotinylated and non-biotinylated PAMAM <b>dendrimers</b> in brain. AFM studies showed evidence of <b>dendrimers</b> only in brain tissue of treated rats. These results indicate that biotinylation does not decrease toxicity associated with PAMAM <b>dendrimers</b> and that biotinylated PAMAM <b>dendrimers</b> distribute in the brain. Furthermore, this article provides evidence of nanoparticles in brain tissue following systemic administration of nanoparticles supported by both fluorescence microscopy and AFM...|$|R
40|$|The layer-by-layer {{incorporation}} of monomers in {{the synthesis of}} <b>dendrimers</b> allows for variations in the functionalities between one layer and the next. However, {{incorporation of}} different functionalities {{in combination with the}} above would lead to the introduction of sequences in <b>dendrimers.</b> We review the three complementary synthetic methods we have developed for sequencing the <b>dendrimers.</b> We also illustrate the utility of these methodologies in identifying certain fundamental properties of <b>dendrimers.</b> More specifically, we have probed the intermediate layers of the <b>dendrimers</b> by incorporation of spectroscopic probes in precise locations within <b>dendrimers.</b> Similarly, we have utilized this method to identify the true architectural advantages of <b>dendrimers</b> as light harvesters in solar energy applications...|$|R
50|$|The first {{component}} in DEN synthesis is the <b>dendrimer</b> itself. By using different sizes, or generations, of dendrimers {{it is possible}} to control the size of the nanoparticle to be synthesized. Although there are many types of dendrimers, the most common is the poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) <b>dendrimer.</b> These types of dendrimers are predominantly terminated with either amine or hydroxyl groups. The notation for these dendrimers are in the form of Gx-R, where x is generation of the <b>dendrimer</b> and R is the terminal group of the <b>dendrimer</b> (in most cases R= -OH or -NH2) When metal ions are introduced to a <b>dendrimer</b> in aqueous solution they form a complex with the tertiary amines of the <b>dendrimer</b> notated as Gx-R(Mp+)n, where Mp+ refers to the metal ions used and n refers to the average number of metal ions complexed within each <b>dendrimer.</b> After a complex has formed, a reducing agent such as sodium borohydride is introduced in a high molar excess and the metal ions are reduced to their zerovalent form and come together within the <b>dendrimer</b> to form the DEN notated as Gx-R(Mn) where M is the zerovalent metal used and n is the number of metal atoms.|$|E
50|$|For dendrimers {{to be able}} to be used in {{pharmaceutical}} applications, {{they must}} surmount the required regulatory hurdles to reach market. One <b>dendrimer</b> scaffold designed to achieve this is the Poly Ethoxy Ethyl Glycinamide (PEE-G) <b>dendrimer.</b> This <b>dendrimer</b> scaffold has been designed and shown to have high HPLC purity, stability, aqueous solubility and low inherent toxicity.|$|E
5000|$|Applications {{involving}} dendrimers {{in general}} {{take advantage of}} either stuffing cargo into {{the interior of the}} <b>dendrimer</b> (sometimes referred to as the [...] "dendritic box"), or attaching cargo onto the <b>dendrimer</b> surface. PAMAM <b>dendrimer</b> applications have generally focused on surface modification, taking advantage of both electrostatic and covalent methods for binding cargo. Currently, major areas of study using PAMAM dendrimers and their functionalized derivatives involve drug delivery and gene delivery.|$|E
50|$|Ferrocene-containing <b>dendrimers</b> can be {{synthesized}} by both convergent and divergent methods. Some of {{the first}} <b>dendrimers</b> of this type, were made by attaching ferrocene units to small silicon containing <b>dendrimers.</b>|$|R
40|$|A general {{synthetic}} {{strategy for}} the rapid construction of poly(ether imine) dendrons and <b>dendrimers</b> with a nitrogen core, originating from 3 -amino-propan- 1 -ol, is described. A new trifunctional monomer, namely, 3 -[bis-(3 -hydroxypropyl) amino]propan- 1 -ol, was used in a divergent synthesis of <b>dendrimers</b> up to the third generation. This method permitted installation of, either alcohol, amine, nitrile, ester or carboxylic acid groups at the peripheries the <b>dendrimers.</b> Cytotoxicity studies on water-soluble carboxylic acid terminated <b>dendrimers</b> were conducted and these studies revealed that poly(ether imine) <b>dendrimers</b> were non-toxic. These results illustrate that poly(ether imine) <b>dendrimers</b> are useful for biological studies...|$|R
40|$|Triazine and PAMAM <b>dendrimers</b> {{of similar}} size {{and number of}} {{cationic}} surface groups were compared {{for their ability to}} promote platelet aggregation. Triazine <b>dendrimers</b> (G 3, G 5 and G 7) varied in molecular weight from 8 kDa– 130 kDa and in surface groups 16 – 256. PAMAM <b>dendrimers</b> selected for comparison included G 3 (7 kDa, 32 surface groups) and G 6 (58 kDa, 256 surface groups). The treatment of human platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with low generation triazine <b>dendrimers</b> (0. 01 – 1 µM) did not show any significant effect in human platelet aggregation in vitro; however, the treatment of PRP with larger generations promotes an effective aggregation. These results are in agreement with studies performed with PAMAM <b>dendrimers,</b> where large generations promote aggregation. Triazine <b>dendrimers</b> promote aggregation less aggressively than PAMAM <b>dendrimers,</b> a factor attributed to differences in cationic charge or the formation of supramolecular assemblies of <b>dendrimers...</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>dendrimer</b> is {{assembled}} from a multifunctional core, {{which is}} extended outward {{by a series}} of reactions, commonly a Michael reaction. Each step of the reaction must be driven to full completion to prevent mistakes in the <b>dendrimer,</b> which can cause trailing generations (some branches are shorter than the others). Such impurities can impact the functionality and symmetry of the <b>dendrimer,</b> but are extremely difficult to purify out because the relative size difference between perfect and imperfect dendrimers is very small.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: PAMAM dendrimers can be [...] "activated" [...] for gene {{transfer}} applications via hydrolysis accelerated by heat, {{a process which}} {{can be thought of}} as similar to shearing bushes. During this process, amide bonds are broken and replaced with carboxyl groups (see inset), causing some branches of the <b>dendrimer</b> to fall off. The overall molecular mass of the <b>dendrimer</b> is reduced by 20-25%, and the result is a more flexible <b>dendrimer</b> with transfection efficiencies improved by 2-3 orders of magnitude.|$|E
50|$|The {{solubility}} {{of various}} NSAIDs increases {{when it is}} encapsulated in PAMAM dendrimers. This study shows the enhancement of NSAID solubility {{is due to the}} electrostatic interactions between the surface amine groups in PAMAM and the carboxyl groups found in NSAIDs. Contributing to the increase in solubility are the hydrophobic interactions between the aromatic groups in the drugs and the interior cavities of the <b>dendrimer.</b> When a drug is encapsulated within a <b>dendrimer,</b> its physical and physiological properties remains unaltered, including non-specificity and toxicity. However, when the <b>dendrimer</b> and the drug are covalently linked together, it can be used for specific tissue targeting and controlled release rates. Covalent conjugation of multiple drugs on <b>dendrimer</b> surfaces can pose a problem of insolubility.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In this work, {{the use of}} β-cyclodextrine (β-CD) -modified <b>dendrimers</b> as a nanocapsule with a {{biocompatible}} shell have studied. β-CD-modified <b>dendrimers</b> {{have designed}} and synthesized to enhance the loading capacity of the final <b>dendrimers</b> with encapsulation properties. Methods: To achieve β-CD-modified <b>dendrimers,</b> first citric acid <b>dendrimers</b> were synthesized and then the end functional groups of <b>dendrimers</b> were grafted to β-CD through ester linkages. The molecular structures of resulted <b>dendrimers</b> were verified using common spectroscopic methods such as 1 H NMR, FT-IR and the diameters of obtained nanocarriers were evaluated with using dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. The isolated <b>dendrimers</b> were utilized as the drug delivery agents and the encapsulation and the controlled release of guest drug molecule Naltrexone (NLX) was investigated in different pH’s using UV spectroscopy method. Results: It was established that the loading capacity of <b>dendrimers</b> depend on several factors such as their generation and the structure and number of conjugated modifier end groups.

40|$|Introduction: Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) <b>dendrimers</b> are {{a unique}} family of {{dendritic}} polymers with numerous pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. One major problem with these polymers is their cytotoxicity. The {{purpose of this}} study is to synthesize novel <b>dendrimers</b> with aldehyde terminal groups and compare their cytotoxicity with that of <b>dendrimers</b> containing amine terminated groups. Methods: G 1 (first generation) and G 2 (second generation) <b>dendrimers</b> with amine terminated groups were synthesized by divergent method and then the amine terminated groups were converted to the aldehyde groups using surface modification of the functional group inversion (FGI) method. The cytotoxicity of the novel G 1 and G 2 polyamidoaldehyde (PAMAL) <b>dendrimers</b> together with that of G 1 and G 2 PAMAM-NH 2 <b>dendrimers</b> was investigated by MTT assay using MCF- 7 cell line. Results: The results showed that cytotoxicity of <b>dendrimers</b> with aldehyde terminated groups is much lower than that of G 1 and G 2 PAMAM-NH 2 <b>dendrimers.</b> Conclusion: <b>Dendrimers</b> with aldehyde terminated groups could be used as novel and convenient carriers for drug delivery with low cytotoxic effect compared with the amine terminated denderimers. The results revealed that the same generations of the <b>dendrimers</b> with aldehyde-terminated groups are far less toxic than the corresponding amine-terminated denderimer...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the Study: The overall aim of {{the present}} work was to {{elucidate}} the effects of iontophoresis on assisting permeation/deposition of peptide <b>dendrimers</b> across/within human skin. Procedures: A series of peptide <b>dendrimers</b> containing arginine and histidine as terminal acids were synthesized and characterized. These <b>dendrimers</b> were subjected to passive and iontophoretic permeation studies across human epidermis. Results: The synthesized peptide <b>dendrimers</b> {{were found to be}} stable in epidermal, dermal and skin extracts up to 6 h. Passive diffusion studies revealed that none of the synthesized peptide <b>dendrimers</b> permeated human epidermis up to 6 h, although minute concentrations of low molecular weight <b>dendrimers</b> were detected in receptor medium at the end of 24 h. Application of iontophoresis significantly increased the permeation of all the tested peptide <b>dendrimers</b> across human skin in a molecular weight-dependent manner compared to simple passive diffusion. Electromigration was found to be the dominant mechanism behind the iontophoretic permeation of peptide <b>dendrimers</b> across human skin. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that iontophoresis is an effective technique in enhancing the transdermal permeation of peptide <b>dendrimers.</b> Message of the Paper: This study foresees the possibility of applying peptide <b>dendrimers</b> in iontophoretic delivery of drugs and macromolecules across/within the skin.

40|$|Conventional <b>dendrimers</b> are spherical symmetrically {{branched}} polymers ending with active surface functional groups. Polyamidoamine (PAMAM) <b>dendrimers</b> {{have been widely}} studied as gene delivery vectors and have proven effective at delivering DNA to cells in vitro. However, higher-generation (G 4 -G 8) PAMAM <b>dendrimers</b> exhibit toxicity due to their high cationic charge density and this has limited their application in vitro and in vivo. Another limitation arises when attempts are made to functionalize spherical <b>dendrimers</b> as targeting moieties cannot be site-specifically attached. Therefore, we propose that lower-generation asymmetric <b>dendrimers,</b> which are likely devoid of toxicity and to which site-specific attachment of targeting ligands can be achieved, would be {{a viable alternative to}} currently available <b>dendrimers.</b> We synthesized and characterized a series of peptide-based asymmetric <b>dendrimers</b> and compared their toxicity profile and ability to condense DNA to spherical PAMAM G 1 <b>dendrimers.</b> We show that asymmetric <b>dendrimers</b> are minimally toxic and condense DNA into stable toroids which have been reported necessary for efficient cell transfection.

We compared the properties of these benzene-centered <b>dendrimers</b> with an equivalent family of <b>dendrimers</b> that differs only in having a nitrogen atom as the central unit. We found that the aggregation of <b>dendrimers</b> was strongly dependent on the degree of delocalization across the central unit. the <b>dendrimers</b> with the benzene central unit, which have three localized distyrylbenzene chromophores, were found to aggregate more strongly in the solid state that those with nitrogen as the central unit.

50|$|In {{particular}} it {{is possible}} to construct a cationic <b>dendrimer,</b> i.e. one with a positive surface charge.
