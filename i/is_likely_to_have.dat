If the bleeding <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated from an aneurysm (as determined by the CT scan appearance), the choice is between cerebral angiography (injecting radiocontrast through a catheter to the brain arteries) and CT angiography (visualizing blood vessels with radiocontrast on a CT scan) to identify aneurysms. Catheter angiography also offers the possibility of coiling an aneurysm (see below).|$|E

Newton was the second scientist to be knighted, after Sir Francis Bacon.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{effective}} the Caesar cipher {{was at the}} time, but it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language.

5|$|Mozart did {{not write}} down a cadenza for the movement, or at least there is no {{evidence}} of him having done so. Many later composers and performers, including Johannes Brahms, Ferruccio Busoni and Gabriel Fauré, have composed their own. Uniquely among Mozart's concertos, the score does not direct the soloist to end the cadenza with a cadential trill. The omission of the customary trill <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been deliberate, with Mozart choosing to have the cadenza connect directly to the coda without one.|$|E
5|$|Regressive {{hypothesis}} : Viruses {{may have}} once been small cells that parasitised larger cells. Over time, genes not required by their parasitism were lost.

5|$|Albanian {{intelligence}} groups informed Skanderbeg—the main {{leader of}} the revolt—that a large Ottoman army was preparing to march into Albania, the number of which was reported by some as being as high as 170,000. This army, however, <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> contained no more than 80,000 soldiers. Nevertheless, Murad marched his army into Monastir. Skanderbeg urgently called for material aid Venice. The answer, however, was negative. Instead, the only aid received came from the Neapolitans and the Ragusans. Nonetheless, Murad soon marched into Ohrid and Black Drin valley, traveling near Svetigrad. In response, Skanderbeg strengthened the garrisons of Krujë, Stellushi, Svetigrad, and Berat by ordering the populations around these fortress to take up arms.|$|E
5|$|Arthur Blake Heinemann {{created the}} first breed {{standard}} and, in 1894, he founded the Devon and Somerset Badger Club, the aims of which were to promote badger digging rather than fox hunting, and the breeding of terriers suitable for this purpose. Terriers were acquired from Nicholas Snow of Oare, and they were likely descended from Russell's original dogs, as Russell would probably have hunted at some point with Snow's hunting club and <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> provided {{at least some of}} their original terriers. By the turn of the 20th century, Russell's name had become associated with this breed of dog.|$|E
5|$|Australian mycologist John Burton Cleland noted it {{occurring}} under larch (Larix), oak, pine, birch {{and other}} introduced trees in South Australia in 1934, {{and it has}} subsequently been recorded in New South Wales, Victoria (where it was found near Betula and Populus) and Western Australia. It has been recorded under introduced birch (Betula) and hazel (Corylus) in New Zealand. Mycologist Rolf Singer reported a similar situation in South America, with the species recorded under introduced trees in Chile.

5|$|Boletus edulis {{grows in}} some areas where it is not {{believed}} to be indigenous. It is often found underneath oak and silver birch in Hagley Park in central Christchurch, New Zealand, where it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been introduced, probably on the roots of container-grown beech, birch, and oak in the mid-19th century—around the time exotic trees began to be planted in the Christchurch area. Similarly, it has been collected in Adelaide Hills region of Australia in association with three species of introduced trees. It has been growing plentifully in association with pine forests in the southern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands in South Africa for more than 50 years and {{is believed to have}} been introduced with the import of pine trees. It also grows in pine plantations in neighboring Zimbabwe.|$|E
5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface. Because the planet has only been {{detected}} indirectly, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Due to its mass it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a surface gravity 68 times that of Earth. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} what {{proportion}} of the corps commanders had risen from the ranks, but it <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been small as most rankers would be nearing retirement age {{by the time they}} were given command of a regiment and would be promoted no further. In contrast, directly commissioned protectores and tribuni dominated the higher echelons, as they were usually young men when they started. For such men, promotion to corps command could be swift e.g. the future emperor Theodosius I was a dux at age 28. It was also possible for rungs on the rank-ladder to be skipped. Commanders of scholae, who enjoyed direct access to the emperor, often reached the highest rank of magister militum: e.g. the barbarian-born officer Agilo was promoted direct to magister militum from tribunus of a schola in 360, skipping the dux stage.|$|E
