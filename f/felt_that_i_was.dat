5|$|Through a {{fortunate}} {{combination of}} circumstances I escaped from prison before my trial {{came on and}} lived for eighteen days in the forist(sic) and fields near Little Rock without a morsil(sic) of food except such raw corn and berries as I could gather in my lone wanderings. While a prisoner I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> ungenerously treated by the harsh criticisms {{of the press and}} individuals not only in regard to my want of loyalty to the southern caus(sic) but also with regard to my supposed want of courage. I therefore resolved if God would grant me deliverance I would at once enter the Federal Army.|$|E
500|$|... "When Kane {{came out}} in script form, Orson told all of us about the picture {{and said that the}} most {{important}} aspect was the makeup," [...] Seiderman recalled. [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> being given an assignment that was unique—so I worked accordingly. And {{there was a lot of}} work to do. Straight makeups were done in the makeup department by staff, but all the trick stuff and the principal characters were my personal work; nobody else ever touched them. They could not have handled it." ...|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was when I put on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not worthy}} of the job, my dear. <b>I</b> have always <b>felt</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> too complex, and {{sometimes}} I can't see the right alone, as she could." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} {{in the family and}} don’t have a brother. Shouldering family responsibility is tiangjingdiyi (born as nature). My father died when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> still a teenager. Since then, <b>I</b> have always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a semi-parent of the family. I told my husband before marriage I would not skip my responsibility to support the family (Bixiang).|$|R
5000|$|Being {{included}} on the [...] "S.H.I.T. LIST" [...] {{has become something of}} a badge of honor among some Jewish leftists. As one woman explained, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in good company when I saw who else was on the list." [...] According to one writer, [...] "activists compare their status, those who are left out wondering whether they should submit themselves." ...|$|R
500|$|The puzzles, {{according}} to Broady, were of uneven quality. He called some [...] "hopelessly difficult" [...] and others extremely derivative. By contrast, he viewed the Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton dialogue puzzle as [...] "brilliant", but said, [...] "Ideas as original as Horse's call for puzzles to match, not rehashes of things we've seen {{far too many}} times already." [...] Ramsey thought the puzzles were challenging but not overly difficult, arguing [...] "on almost every occasion I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making progress, and I never felt bogged down and hopelessly lost." [...] He felt the puzzles were mostly well-integrated, and found those that were not did not detract from his enjoyment. Ivey remarked, [...] "For puzzle lovers, Drowned God is a treasure trove. ... This collection of tricky puzzlers are challenging and frequently innovative." ...|$|E
500|$|In Nashville, Swift {{worked with}} {{experienced}} Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and The Warren Brothers. She eventually formed a lasting {{working relationship with}} Liz Rose. They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school. Rose thought that the sessions were [...] "some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write {{about what happened in}} school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks". Swift was signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house, but left RCA Records when she was 14. She later recalled: [...] "I genuinely <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through".|$|E
500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to be like mother, and the best thing for me was to die." ...|$|E
3000|$|Since I came to Australia, <b>I</b> always <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a bit lower grade, my {{self-esteem}} <b>was</b> damaged because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> told <b>that</b> <b>I</b> couldn’t speak English {{like the}} local people and I had some ‘accent’. If I can’t speak English like Australians, I’d be behind them. So, <b>I</b> expect <b>that</b> the program correct our English and help us improve it (Tomoko) [...]...|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{apprehensive}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> personally {{interested in}} this dialogue, and sought Mr. Murdstone's eye as it lighted on mine.|$|R
500|$|Williamson {{provided}} {{the covers and}} additional artwork for Dark Horse Comics' 20-issue Classic Star Wars (Aug. 1992 – June 1994), which reprinted his Star Wars daily strips. He later inked the [...] and A New Hope film adaptations for the company. [...] Through 2003, he was active as inker on several Marvel Comics titles, including Daredevil (#248–300), Spider-Man 2099 (#1–25), and Spider-Girl (#1–61), and such non-superhero projects as the four-issue Marvel / Epic Comics miniseries Atomic Age (Nov. 1990 – Feb. 1991), by writer Frank Lovece and penciler Mike Okamoto, for which Williamson won a 1991 Eisner Award for Best Inker. Daredevil penciler John Romita Jr. recalled that, [...] "Working with Al Williamson was much like working with my father [...] in that I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> protected from mistakes. ... If my art wasn’t correct, then Al would repair it. Oddly enough, Al said he never had to fix anything, claiming he just 'traced' over my pencils." [...] In a 1988 interview Williamson indeed stated that [...] "I'm just tracing [...] pencils" [...] and claimed that the only changes he made were occasionally leaving out an unnecessary background {{if he was in}} a rush.|$|E
500|$|Fuller {{began her}} formal {{education}} at the Port School in Cambridgeport in 1819 before attending the Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies from 1821 to 1822. In 1824, she {{was sent to the}} School for Young Ladies in Groton, on the advice of aunts and uncles, though she resisted the idea at first. While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not run for re-election, in order to help John Quincy Adams with his presidential campaign in 1824; he hoped Adams would return the favor with a governmental appointment. On June 17, 1825, Fuller attended the ceremony at which the American Revolutionary War hero Marquis de Lafayette laid the cornerstone of the Bunker Hill Monument 50 years after the battle. Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16. At home she studied the classics and trained herself in several modern languages and read world literature. By this time, she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age. She wrote, [...] "I have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not born to the common womanly lot." [...] Eliza Farrar, wife of Harvard professor John Farrar and author of The Young Lady's Friend (1836), attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20, but was never wholly successful.|$|E
2500|$|I {{would say}} that I got into jazz when I got into Woody Herman's band because that band was sorta jazz-oriented. They had records. It was the first band I ever joined where the musicians carried records on the road... Duke Ellington records... Woody Herman discs [...] Charlie Barnet V-Discs... That's the first time I sort of got into jazz. The first time I sort of <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{anything}} remotely connected with jazz.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is honest}} at any rate. You <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> too much ashamed of what <b>I</b> said to <b>be</b> {{able to look}} you in the face." ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not want}} to sit down, but, as I said before, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> must <b>be</b> politic, and so took a seat {{on the other end of}} the sofa.|$|R
6000|$|... “In a sense.” Osborne’s {{tone was}} grave. “Still, {{it was not}} what I’d now {{consider}} a large amount, and I’ve sometimes <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wouldn’t <b>be</b> sorry for an excuse to give it back.” ...|$|R
2500|$|After {{they agreed}} to support Dodd for auditor, either Earl or Blanche Long, or both, enticed Douglas Fowler, a local {{politician}} from Coushatta, the seat of Red River Parish, to enter the race. At first, Earl Long let Fowler speak on the platform, but Dodd said that [...] "the public <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the real Long candidate, and Fowler finally quit making our meetings. Miss Blanche threw {{me a couple of}} curves, including the printing up of some Earl Long ticket sample ballots with my number beside Fowler's name. But we caught her trick and corrected it." ...|$|E
60|$|Sometimes when I {{thought the}} whole matter out I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> growing crazy.|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{no longer}} alone and looking round, saw Goza at my side.|$|E
6000|$|... "I feel bright," [...] said Jim. [...] "For one thing, I've got up, {{and then}} you have been here some time. You brace one. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> very sick." ...|$|R
60|$|Certainly {{there is}} no nobler field for human effort than the {{insurance}} line of business--especially accident insurance. Ever since <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> a director in an accident-insurance company <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a better man. Life has seemed more precious. Accidents have assumed a kindlier aspect. Distressing special providences have lost half their horror. I look upon a cripple now with affectionate interest--as an advertisement. I {{do not seem to}} care for poetry any more. I do not care for politics--even agriculture does not excite me. But to me now there is a charm about a railway collision that is unspeakable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then he acts deliberately. Forgive me; <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> unless <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{certain of}} this virtual {{resignation}} of the unspoken hope, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not acting fairly in allowing-—I cannot say encouraging—-what I cannot help seeing." ...|$|R
60|$|I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not {{carrying}} out my embassy with any great skill. I was distinctly nettled.|$|E
60|$|His face {{suggested}} {{something worse}} than his words expressed. My {{heart began to}} beat fast, and I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> turning pale.|$|E
60|$|My {{distaste for}} the {{situation}} became more acute, but I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thrown on the defensive. I could not retreat, now.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> {{absurd to}} believe {{for a moment}} that Mariposilla could have wished to reënter the place, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> also {{convinced}} <b>that,</b> in her feeble condition, she could never have walked the distance from the ranch.|$|R
60|$|Then I {{told him}} of my {{conversation}} with Isobel's cousin, excepting the last episode. His gratification was scarcely equal to mine. He was a little thoughtful for some time afterwards. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sure he <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> indiscreet.|$|R
6000|$|At night, when I {{had gone}} to bed, Joe came into my room, {{as he had done}} all through my recovery. He asked me if <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{as well as in the}} morning? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} to hear it. I should have <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making myself too disagreeable--taking the best of everything," [...] said Gwendolen, quite easily.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Now I {{shall have}} a lively time!' I thought, and looked gaily about me, for I liked adventures, and <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> sure of them now.|$|E
6000|$|I {{looked at}} him quickly, but he was gazing abstractedly at the fire. I <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> no match for my friend at badinage, and gave it up! ...|$|E
60|$|There {{was silence}} in the mess after my remarks, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> indiscreet when <b>I</b> saw the glances that were cast at me. The colonel {{especially}} was furious, and a great major named Olivier, who was the fire-eater of the regiment, sat opposite to me curling his huge black moustaches, and staring {{at me as if}} he would eat me. However, I did not resent his attitude, for <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had indeed <b>been</b> indiscreet, and that it would give a bad impression if upon this my first evening I quarrelled with my superior officer.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. I {{walked across}} those fields to the park, and I seemed {{suddenly}} {{to feel more}} like a boy again, and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> somehow <b>I</b> <b>was</b> letting go of things. Do you know what I mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'd never hold my head {{up again}} if <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> driven out. Besides, {{what is there}} to be afraid of? Are we not free folks in a free country? If you love me, and I you, who will dare to come between?" ...|$|R
