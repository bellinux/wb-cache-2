As {{a result of}} one violation, Enron's balance sheet understated its liabilities and overstated its equity, and its earnings were overstated. Enron disclosed to its shareholders that it had hedged downside risk in its own illiquid investments using special purpose entities. However, investors were oblivious {{to the fact that}} the special purpose entities were actually using the company's own stock and financial guarantees to finance these hedges. This prevented Enron from being protected from the downside risk. Notable examples of special purpose entities that Enron employed were JEDI, Chewco, Whitewing, and LJM.|$|E

Cockrell says that, unlike previous minstrel songs, [...] "Old Dan Tucker" [...] is meant <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> dancing; its tune is developed enough to stand on its own. Contemporary critics certainly noticed the difference. Y. S. Nathanson called it [...] "the best of what I have denominated the ancient negro ballads.

500|$|Ants use {{pheromone}}s <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> making trails. A crushed ant emits {{an alarm}} pheromone that sends nearby ants into an attack frenzy and attracts more ants from farther away. Several ant species even use [...] "propaganda pheromones" [...] to confuse enemy ants {{and make them}} fight among themselves. Pheromones are produced by {{a wide range of}} structures including Dufour's glands, poison glands and glands on the hindgut, pygidium, rectum, sternum, and hind tibia. Pheromones also are exchanged, mixed with food, and passed by trophallaxis, transferring information within the colony. This allows other ants to detect what task group (e.g., foraging or nest maintenance) other colony members belong to. In ant species with queen castes, when the dominant queen stops producing a specific pheromone, workers begin to raise new queens in the colony.|$|E
500|$|Shikasta was {{intended}} to be a [...] "single self-contained book", but as Lessing's fictional universe developed, she found she had ideas <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> one book, and ended up writing a series of five. Shikasta, and the Canopus in Argos series as a whole, fall into the category of soft science fiction ("space fiction" [...] in Lessing's own words) due to their focus on characterization and social and cultural issues, and the de-emphasis of science and technology. Robert Alter of The New York Times suggested that this kind of writing belongs to a genre literary critic Northrop Frye called the [...] "anatomy", which is [...] "a combination of fantasy and morality". Gore Vidal placed Lessing's [...] "science fiction" [...] "somewhere between John Milton and L. Ron Hubbard".|$|E

500|$|Yermolinsky also {{agrees with}} Alekhine's {{criticism}} of 1.g3 e5 2.Nf3, a reversed Alekhine's Defense, in Réti–Alekhine, Baden-Baden 1925, writing that Alekhine [...] "understood {{the difference in}} opening philosophies for White and Black, and realized they just can't be the same! White is supposed to try <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> obtaining a comfortable game in reversed colour opening set-ups, and, as the statistics show—surprisingly {{for a lot of}} people, but not for me—White doesn't even score as well as Black does in the same positions with his extra tempo and all." [...] Howard Staunton, generally considered to have been the strongest player in the world from 1843 to 1851, made a similar point over 160 years ago, writing that Owen's Defense (1.e4 b6) is playable for Black, but that 1.b3 is inferior to [...] "the more customary [...] moves, from its being essentially defensive". The current view is that Owen's Defense is slightly better for White, while 1.b3 is playable but less likely to yield an opening advantage than 1.e4 or 1.d4.|$|E

She begins {{to spend more time with}} Ramakanth and becomes the focus of tabloid gossip after noted journalist Naila (Anju Mahendru) criticises Silk for having a romantic relationship with both brothers. To avoid scandal, and also to get revenge, Suryakanth drops Silk from his forthcoming films, forcing her to work with smaller, unknown filmmakers. She loses interest in her work and begins to feel threatened by a younger aspiring actress, Shakeela. During a dance challenge she intentionally trips Shakeela, much to the embarrassment of Ramakanth who then decides to end their relationship.|$|E
500|$|In {{an early}} review, Billboard called the record [...] "short, to the point, and bristling with attitude," [...] and {{predicted}} it would poise the band for commercial breakthrough. In a less enthusiastic review, Rolling Stone Neva Chonin wrote, [...] "It's all harmless but still gnarly enough to foment {{the kind of}} anti-everything rebellion that spawned rock & roll {{way back in the}} day." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic desbribed it as a [...] "fun record that's better than the average neo-punk release." [...] Kerrang! wrote that the album includes [...] "enough energy, attitude and cracking songs here to ensure that blink will be remembered <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> onstage nudity." [...] The catchy, pop sensibility of the album was praised by Stephen Thompson of The A.V. Club, describing the band as finding success within a [...] "well-worn genre" [...] (punk rock). The New York Times also designated the record its 'Album of the Week'. The record did have its detractors: British music publication New Musical Express (NME) gave the record a very poor review, calling the record despicable, [...] "wholly toothless and soulless" [...] and deriding the band as [...] "as bad, as meaningless, as the cock-rockers and hippy wankers punk originally sought to destroy." ...|$|E

500|$|The Saint Martins gig was {{followed}} by other performances at colleges and art schools around London. One of these, on 9 December 1975, was at Ravensbourne College, Chislehurst, near Bromley in Southeast London, where they supported the Newcastle-based rock band Fogg. The band played for free as according to McLaren they were 'turning professional' the following year, although as McLaren's letter confirming the booking stated: 'free beer for the band would be appreciated'. Despite the band's punk posturing, their PA equipment (including EV Eliminator bass bins) was {{so much better than}} that of the established touring band Fogg that their equipment was used for the gig. The result of them staying later was a bar bill of over £50 (equivalent to £ in [...] ) during the headliner's performance. Simon Barker, a friend of Steve Severin, saw the gig and enthused about the band. This resulted in them seeing the band at the Marquee on 12 February 1976. The Sex Pistols' core group of followers—including Siouxsie Sioux, Steven Severin, Soo Catwoman, and Billy Idol—came {{to be known as the}} Bromley Contingent, after the large suburban town several were from. Their cutting-edge fashion, much of it supplied by SEX, ignited a trend that was adopted by the new fans the band attracted. McLaren and Westwood saw the incipient London punk movement as a vehicle <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>just</b> couture. They were both captivated by the May 1968 radical uprising in Paris, particularly by the ideology and agitations of the Situationists, as well as the anarchist thought of Buenaventura Durruti and others.|$|E

[...] Critic Simon Reynolds disagreed; {{he wrote in his}} review for The New York Times that [...] "fuzzed-up riffs and angst-wracked vocals are quite the norm these days, and Smashing Pumpkins lacks the zeitgeist-defining edge that made Nirvana's breakthrough so thrilling and resonant." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice cited [...] "Geek U.S.A." [...] and [...] "Today" [...] as highlights, later awarding the album a three-star honorable mention rating.

Accordingly, Saints Row 2 was compared to the Grand Theft Auto series' own upcoming sequel, Grand Theft Auto IV.
