40|$|Organophosphates and carbamates (OPs/CMs) {{are known}} for their {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibiting character. A cross-sectional study of pesticide handling practices and self-perceived symptoms of acute pesticide poisoning was conducted using questionnaire-based interviews with 89 pesticide sprayers in Boeung Cheung Ek (BCE) Lake, Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The study showed that 50 % of the pesticides used belonged to WHO class I + II and <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> among the farmers were inadequate. A majority of the farmers (88 %) had experienced symptoms of acute pesticide poisoning, and this was significantly associated with the number of hours spent spraying with OPs/CMs (OR = 1. 14, CI 95 %: 1. 02 – 1. 28). The higher educated farmers reduced their risk of poisoning by 55 % for each <b>extra</b> <b>personal</b> protective measure they adapted (OR = 0. 45, CI 95 %: 0. 22 – 0. 91). These findings suggest that improving safe pesticide management practices among the farmers and enforcing the effective banning of the most toxic pesticides will considerably reduce the number of acute pesticide poisoning episodes...|$|R

Finally, this paper defines area operations, qualifications requirements of rescuers in area, principles of division, protective objects for different areas, so as to determine the <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> level of emergency rescuers in various areas, which can provide reference for the <b>personal</b> <b>protection</b> of emergency rescuers in dangerous chemical accidents...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Cardiac surgery, due {{to being}} {{associated}} with stressors, has many physiological, psychological, emotional, growths, and spiritual potential consequences. However, {{few studies have been}} conducted about identifying the stressors. Therefore, the objective {{of the study was to}} determine patients’ perceptions of stressors associated with coronary artery bypass surgery. Methods: In this descriptive study during the two-month investigation, qualified patients for participation in the study (68 persons) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery on the third to fifth postoperative day were selected and with using of Revised Cardiac Surgery Stressors Scale (RCSSS), interpersonal, intrapersonal, and <b>extra</b> <b>personal</b> stressors were determined. Results: The findings showed that intrapersonal stressors are perceived more than interpersonal and <b>extra</b> <b>personal</b> stressors by patients. In the analysis of data, the highest stressors were "pain and discomfort", "the need to have heart surgery", "death due to illness or surgery", "being away from home and work", "having chest tube". Conclusion: In this study the intrapersonal stressors were perceived more than interpersonal and <b>extra</b> <b>personal</b> stressors by patients, which nurses should put emphasis on identification and elimination of intrapersonal stressors based on the needs of patients...|$|R
