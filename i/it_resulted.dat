40|$|A {{paradox is}} called a {{statement}} which is true and false in the same time. Therefore, if we suppose that statement is true, <b>it</b> <b>results</b> that is false; and reciprocally, if we suppose that is false, <b>it</b> <b>results</b> that is true. 2. But there are statements that do not completely obey this definition. We call a Semi-Paradox a statement such that either supposing that is true <b>it</b> <b>results</b> that is false (but not reciprocally), or supposing that is false <b>it</b> <b>results</b> that is true (but not reciprocally). So, the statement has a degree of 0. 50 (50 %) of a paradox, and 0. 50 of a non-paradox. 3. Three-Quarters Paradox. 3. 1. Definition. There are cases when a statement can be between a paradox and a semi-paradox. For example: a) If we suppose that the statement is true, <b>it</b> <b>results</b> that is false, but reciprocally if we suppose that the statement is false, {{it may be possible}} resulting that is true. Therefore, the second implication (conditional) does not always occur...|$|R
