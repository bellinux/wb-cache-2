5|$|Caragiale used Mitică as a stock {{character}} to feature in satirical contexts; the biographical insights he provided are short and often contradict each other. Among Mitică's traits are his tendency to generate sarcastic comebacks and sententious catchphrases, a Francized speech, {{as well as}} inclinations to waste time and easily find {{his way out of}} problematic situations. His existence is connected to events in the history of Bucharest which he occasionally references in his jokes. Like Lache and Mache, who are present in Caragiale's fiction, the character is usually portrayed as a civil servant who <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> making ends meet, but who is well liked by his peers.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} skilled nature {{required}} for playing the agung, {{it is not uncommon}} to see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks in an attempt to throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming the butt of jokes. Normally agung players switch off after each piece, but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E
5|$|Season three {{takes on}} a {{significantly}} greater serialized format. Rachel begins working at Bloomingdale's, an upscale department store chain, and Ross becomes jealous of her colleague, Mark. Rachel decides to take a break; and Ross, hurt and drunk, sleeps with someone else, causing Rachel to break up with him. In the meantime, Chandler <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> dealing with their breakup because it reminds him of his parents' divorce. After believing she has no family except her twin sister Ursula (Lisa Kudrow), Phoebe becomes acquainted with her half-brother (Giovanni Ribisi) and birth mother (Teri Garr). Joey develops a relationship with his acting partner Kate (Dina Meyer), and Monica begins a relationship with millionaire Pete Becker (Jon Favreau) which ends because of disagreements between the two.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{decides to}} start {{painting}} her mural in the warehouse, but <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> getting started {{as she is}} afraid of it not being perfect. Meanwhile, bored with having to fill out customer complaint cards (which he finds redundant because the complaints {{are already in the}} computer), Pete Miller (Jake Lacy) uses them to build a card tower in the annex with other employees. The card tower takes on a deeper meaning for the employees when Pete points out that it is composed of failures made by every one of them (excepting only Pam), and thus proves that they should not be ashamed of their failures. They decide {{to try to make it}} go all the way to the ceiling, but end up one complaint card short. Not wanting to use a blank card as it would defy the point of the tower, Pam offers to complete the tower by getting her first customer complaint. She calls one of their smaller clients, delivers a yo mama joke, and hangs up. The client, whose mother was actually obese and is now deceased, drops Dunder Mifflin as their paper supplier, leaving them simultaneously excited over getting that last complaint and disappointed over losing a client. After celebrating the completion of the card tower, Pam finally starts painting the mural, saying artists should not care too much in what others think, further asserting this by telling off Hide (Hidetoshi Imura) when he insults her artwork.|$|E

25|$|The auguste {{character}}-type {{is often}} an anarchist, a joker, or a fool. He is clever and has much lower status than the whiteface. Classically the whiteface character instructs the auguste character to perform his bidding. The auguste <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> performing a given task, which leads to funny situations. Sometimes the auguste {{plays the role of}} an anarchist and purposefully has trouble following the whiteface's directions. Sometimes the auguste is confused or is foolish and makes errors less deliberately.|$|E

Even though they have a close relationship, Hikari is in love with Ooishi, and this causes hard times in Hikari and Mao's friendship. He knows of her feelings for him, but remains by her side no matter what.|$|E
25|$|A few {{technical}} glitches {{with the}} DeLorean hinder time travel for its users. In the first film, {{the car has}} starter problems and <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> restarting once stopped, much to Marty's repeated frustration. In the second movie, the destination time display malfunctions and shows random dates (mostly January 1, 1885), which partially cause Doc {{to be sent to}} 1885. In the third movie, the flying circuits (added by Doc in 2015), fuel line, and fuel injection manifold are damaged, preventing the car from moving under its own power.|$|E
25|$|The Quinlan Quints: four {{quintuplets}} (the fifth {{one went}} missing {{and has never}} been found) who live in Buchans, Newfoundland and Labrador – inspired by the fame of the Dionne quintuplets; portrayed by Cathy Jones, Rick Mercer, Greg Thomey and Mary Walsh (Colin Mochrie plays Mercer's quint role for seasons 9 and 10). Usually interviewed by Mercer's character J.B. Dickson, the Quints would boast about something outlandish that Dickson <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> believing until one of the quints (usually Jones) spills the beans and reveals that what they were promoting was really a scam. Discontinued when Mochrie left the show.|$|E

25|$|Dana's and Kevin's happy reunion is short-lived, as Kevin <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> {{adjusting}} to the present after {{living in the past}} for five years. He shares a few details of his life in the past with Dana: he witnessed stomach-churning atrocities against slaves, traveled farther and farther up north, worked as a teacher, helped slaves escape and had to grow up a beard to disguise himself from a lynch mob. Disconcerted that he does not feel happy to be back home, he grows angry and cold. Deciding to let him work his feelings out for himself, Dana packs a bag in case she time travels again.|$|E
25|$|The other {{significant}} {{form of communication}} is between the two couples and is different between the genders. Nancy is very curious about and open with the lizards. Though she does become slightly frustrated by their limitations, she tries to help them by explaining aspects of human life they do not understand. Her general kindness toward them and offer of help when the lizards are deciding whether to stay on land or {{to go back to}} the sea influences their decision. Charlie is less forthcoming and more suspicious. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> accepting the lizards and quickly becomes testy when they do not understand his explanations.|$|E
25|$|The {{plots and}} subplots of the episodes are {{established}} in an outline written by David, and the dialogue is largely improvised by the actors (a technique known as retroscripting). As with Seinfeld, which David co-created, {{the subject matter}} in Curb Your Enthusiasm often involves the minutiae of American daily social life, and plots often revolve around Larry David's many faux pas and his problems with certain social conventions and expectations, {{as well as his}} annoyance with other people's behavior. The character <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> letting such annoyances go unexpressed, which often leads him into awkward situations. He is also routinely the victim of elaborate misunderstandings wherein other characters believe that he has done something morally terrible or disgusting.|$|E

25|$|The {{expansion}} of Gullknapp attracted criticism from some sources. This was mostly {{concerned with the}} services at Kjevik. Professor Frode Steen stated that Kjevik <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> attracting international routes and retaining competition on the route to Oslo. If {{a significant amount of}} patronage is redirect to Gullknapp, this could be a pivoting cause of insufficient volume on certain routes and could see airlines pull out of Kjevik or hinder the establishment of new routes. Also the Confederation of Norwegian Enterprise in Agder stated that they were opposed to an expansion, stating that Agder was best served with one primary airport. Similarly, the Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries opposed the expansion, stating that it would weaken Kjevik and Torp.|$|E
25|$|Chibiusa's {{affections}} {{come into}} conflict. Despite being self-aware {{of the fact}} that Usagi Tsukino and Mamoru Chiba are her biological parents, she does not immediately identify them as such, instead suspiciously viewing them as strangers who look like them. There is evidence that Chibiusa <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> identifying Usagi and Mamoru as being her parents since she sees such a sharp contrast in personality between their present and future selves. She also reacts differently toward Usagi and Mamoru than she does towards King Endymion and Neo-Queen Serenity, being more respectful to the latter but more spontaneous to the former; it is not clear if she prefers one set over the other. However, she always calls her teenage father Mamoru as Mamo-chan (in the 20th century), an affectionate nickname by Usagi, and has an innocent crush on him, much to Usagi's fury.|$|E
25|$|There is {{critical}} debate over exactly what genre of play Seascape is. Some {{believe it is}} a comedy, while others see it as absurdist, satirical, or allegorical. Most agree that an element of fantasy is involved. While Nancy and Charlie are humans and act accordingly, Leslie and Sarah are fantastic creations. They are human-sized lizards that have left their life in the sea to live on land. They speak perfect English and understand some aspects of human life. Charlie <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> accepting that they are real. He wants {{to believe that he}} and Nancy see them because they are suffering from food poisoning or are dead. In terms of the play Leslie and Sarah are very real, a fact that Nancy immediately grasps and embraces. The fantasy aspect of the play creates dramatic irony and allows issues such as progress, values, and differences to be discussed.|$|E

He starts mentoring ward sister Chrissie Williams (Tina Hobley), during her nurse consultant training. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> teaching her the importance of delegation in a consultant role. They become close and later start dating.

The father of Chrissie's child, registrar Sacha Levy (Bob Barret) finds it hard to accept that Chrissie has moved on. The situation worsens when they have conflicting views on medicine. Dan decides to put his surgeon skills to the test when consultant Ric Griffin (Hugh Quarshie) challenges him to complete his list of operations first. Feeling competitive, Dan rushes through an operation and makes an error. He gets Ric to step in to save the patient, with Ric taking the blame. Dan starts to feel like his relationship with Chrissie isn't going anywhere fast, so he invites her around to consummate their relationship. Chrissie is annoyed by Dan pressuring her, he tries to make things right again.|$|E
25|$|Erica Kane and Dimitri Marick {{fall in love}} {{while he}} is {{attempting}} a hostile takeover of her cosmetics company, Enchantment. They appear in a face-to-face meeting on TV's Market Street Week to debate. Afterwards, they meet privately and argue, at which point their animosity turns to passion and he pulls her into a kiss that she responds to. Their relationship cannot go further than that because he is married to Angelique Voynitzeva and {{she is in a}} loveless marriage to Adam Chandler. Dimitri pursues her despite these roadblocks. Erica turns down his advances, refusing to be anyone's mistress. Eventually he wears down her resistance and they begin an affair. He promises to divorce Angelique, but <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> doing so because she is not in the best of health. Once free of their spouses, Erica and Dimitri travel to Budapest in his native country, Hungary. While in Budapest, Erica is kidnapped twice. Once by Dimitri's estranged half brother, Edmund Grey, who wants to be acknowledged as a Marick. Then she is kidnapped by Helga, Angelique's mother, who wants to keep her daughter and Dimitri together. She locks Erica in Hugo Marick's crypt. Working together with Edmund, Dimitri rescues Erica and Helga falls to her death. Erica goes into a catatonic state requiring she be placed in Oak Haven, a mental institution in Pine Valley. Once Erica recovers, she and Dimitri plan to marry.|$|E
