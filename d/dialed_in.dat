25|$|A {{resistance}} {{decade box}} or resistor substitution box is a unit containing resistors of many values, {{with one or}} more mechanical switches which allow any one of various discrete resistances offered by the box to be <b>dialed</b> <b>in.</b> Usually the resistance is accurate to high precision, ranging from laboratory/calibration grade accuracy of 20 parts per million, to field grade at 1%. Inexpensive boxes with lesser accuracy are also available. All types offer a convenient way of selecting and quickly changing a resistance in laboratory, experimental and development work without needing to attach resistors one by one, or even stock each value. The range of resistance provided, the maximum resolution, and the accuracy characterize the box. For example, one box offers resistances from 0 to 100 megohms, maximum resolution 0.1 ohm, accuracy 0.1%.|$|E
25|$|Microprocessor {{technology}} {{allows the}} use of digital onboard effects in guitar amps to create numerous different sounds and tones that simulate {{the sound of a}} range of tube amplifiers and different sized speaker cabinets, all using the same amplifier and speaker. These are known as modeling amplifiers, and can be programmed with simulated characteristic tones of different existing amplifier models (and speaker cabinets—even microphone type or placement), or <b>dialed</b> <b>in</b> to the user's taste. Many amps of this type are also programmable by way of USB connection to a home computer or laptop. Line 6 is generally credited with bringing modeling amplification to the market. Modeling amplifiers and stompbox pedals, rackmount units, and software that models specific amplifiers, speakers cabinets, and microphones can provide a large number of sounds and tones. Players can get a reasonable facsimile of the sound of tube amplifiers, vintage combo amplifiers, and huge 8x10” speaker stacks without bringing all that heavy equipment to the studio or stage.|$|E

500|$|In April 2011, [...] Shackleford {{was entered}} in the Grade 1 [...] $1,000,000 Florida Derby, again at Gulfstream. [...] He drew post number5 and was listed at post time as a 60-1 longshot. [...] Breaking slowly, he floated wide going into the club house turn. [...] On that turn, {{he took over the}} lead from Arch Traveler and To Honor and Serve in a field that {{stretched}} 14lengths back to <b>Dialed</b> <b>In</b> at the rear. [...] Shackleford led down the back stretch and around the final turn, setting a [...] fraction of 46.3 and a [...] in 1:10.6. [...] At the top of the lane, he was challenged by To Honor and Serve and repelled him. [...] Three strides from the wire, he was caught by eventual Kentucky Derby co-favorite <b>Dialed</b> <b>In</b> and just missed the win, finishing second by a head.|$|E
500|$|Mucho Macho Man {{began his}} second year of racing by {{finishing}} fourth behind winner <b>Dialed</b> <b>In</b> in the Grade III Holy Bull Stakes at Gulfstream Park, and once again finished behind Gourmet Dinner, who was third. Mucho Macho Man was then sent to New Orleans for the Risen Star Stakes at the Fair Grounds Race Course. Ridden by Rajiv Maragh, he recorded his first graded stakes win, prevailing by {{one and a half}} lengths over Santiva. Ritvo took away the blinkers for a workout prior to the race and kept them off, stating that the colt had matured and was more at ease without them. [...] At the Risen Star, he first came to the notice of one of his future jockeys, Gary Stevens, then a sports analyst, who noted the colt's calm demeanor, describing him as [...] "a chilled out customer... very relaxed". [...] The next race was the Louisiana Derby, a major preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby. [...] In that race, he lost his right front horseshoe at the start [...] when he [...] "grabbed a quarter"—tearing off the shoe and a bit of his hoof when he stepped on the heel of his front foot with one of his back feet. [...] He finished third behind Pants on Fire and Nehro.|$|E
500|$|Flight {{attendant}} CeeCee Lyles {{called her}} husband at 09:47:57 and left him a message saying the plane had been hijacked. Marion Britton called her friend, Fred Fiumano, at 09:49:12. Fiumano recalled, [...] "she said, 'We're gonna. They're gonna kill us, you know, We're gonna die.' And I told her, 'Don't worry, they hijacked the plane, they're gonna take you for a ride, you go to their country, and you come back. You stay there for vacation.' You don't know what to say—what are you gonna say? I kept on saying the same things, 'Be calm.' And she was crying and—you know—more or less crying and screaming and yelling." [...] Flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw called {{her husband at}} 09:50:04 and {{told him she was}} preparing scalding water to throw at the hijackers. Passenger Lauren Grandcolas called her husband twice, once before takeoff and once during the hijacking. He missed both of her calls. She then passed her phone to Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Wainio called her stepmother at 09:53:43 and concluded, four and a half minutes later, by saying, [...] "I have to go. They're breaking into the cockpit. I love you." [...] Jarrah <b>dialed</b> <b>in</b> the VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequency for the VOR navigational aid at Reagan National Airport at 09:55:11 to direct the plane toward Washington, D.C. Bradshaw, on the phone with her husband, said [...] "Everyone is running up to first class. I've got to go. Bye." [...] Beamer told Jefferson that the group was planning to [...] "jump on" [...] the hijackers and fly the plane into the ground before the hijackers' plan could be followed through. Beamer recited the Lord's Prayer and the 23rd Psalm with Jefferson, prompting others to join in. Beamer requested of Jefferson, [...] "If I don't make it, please call my family and let them know how much I love them." [...] After this, Jefferson heard muffled voices and Beamer clearly answering, [...] "Are you ready? Okay. Let's roll." [...] These were Beamer's last words to Jefferson.|$|E

2500|$|Martin Caballero of USA Today said, [...] "Mobb Deep {{return to}} the spirit of its {{breakthrough}} album The Infamous on its eighth LP. That record established the Queens duo's signature brand of nihilistic raps over intoxicatingly dark instrumentals, and now The Infamous Mobb Deep doesn't stray far from that successful formula." [...] Homer Johnsen of HipHopDX said, [...] "There are no fun and games here. Just business. Havoc and Prodigy are as <b>dialed</b> <b>in</b> as ever. The Infamous Mobb Deep is a {{return to the}} roots of their artistic consciousness, substantiated almost 20 years ago, and with fine precision. With an all-star cast of guest lyricists and a gang of producers, The Infamous Mobb Deep is a loud wake-up call for Hip Hop. The Rap game is survival of the fittest, and Mobb Deep still roams among the strong." [...] Adam Wordkman of The National stated, [...] "While pairing classic with contemporary is risky, it’s an interesting demonstration of the development of Mobb Deep’s thuggish methodology. At two hours, though, the entire experience might test the patience of the uninitiated." ...|$|E
2500|$|The AR-15's most {{distinctive}} ergonomic {{feature is the}} carrying handle and rear sight assembly {{on top of the}} receiver. This is a by-product of the original ArmaLite design, where the carry handle served to protect the charging handle. As the line of sight is [...] over the bore, the AR-15 has an inherent parallax problem. At closer ranges (typically inside 15–20 meters), the shooter must compensate by aiming high to place shots where desired. The standard AR-15 rifle has a 500mm (19.75inches) sight radius. The AR-15 uses an L-type flip, aperture rear sight and it is adjustable with two settings, 0 to 300 meters and 300 to 400 meters. The front sight is a post adjustable for elevation. The rear sight can be adjusted for windage. The sights can be adjusted with a bullet tip or pointed tool. The AR-15 can also mount a scope on the carrying handle. With the advent of the AR-15A2, a new fully adjustable rear sight was added, allowing the rear sight to be <b>dialed</b> <b>in</b> for specific range settings between 300 and 800 meters and to allow windage adjustments without the need of a tool or cartridge. Current versions such as AR-15A4 use Picatinny rails, which allows the use of various scopes and sighting devices.|$|E
