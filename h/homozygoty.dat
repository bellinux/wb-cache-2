40|$|During the {{honeybee}} breeding {{project in}} central Iran, sex alleles <b>homozygoty</b> and sex alleles {{number in the}} third generation of 364 colonies were studied in 2003. Sex alleles <b>homozygoty</b> was measured based on Ruttner (1988) and Tarpy and Page (2002) methods. The total area of worker brood area, stored pollen, and drone brood area were measured on the combs. The whole extracted honey weight and remaining honey in the combs were evaluated as honey production of colonies. Adult population was evaluated {{based on the number}} of full combs of adult honeybees. The results showed that sex alleles, average <b>homozygoty</b> and number in the colonies were 18. 83 % and 5. 32 respectively. The results showed no significant correlation between <b>homozygoty</b> of sex alleles or sex alleles number and stored pollen (P > 0. 05), but significant negative correlation between sex alleles <b>homozygoty</b> and colony population, total brood area and honey yield (P < 0. 01) was observed. So introduction of new sire colonies in the mating Isolated area is essential to prevent sex alleles <b>homozygoty</b> and also performance of honeybee colonies from decreasing...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} the karyometric The present paper {{deals with the}} karyometric {{analysis}} of popula­tions of the planarian Dugesia benazzii Lepori collected in Corsica (Paradojo and Castello Pino strains) and Sardinia (Giocca strain). Paradojo specimens are diploid (2 n = 16; n = 8), sexual and amphimictic; their chromosome complement consists of metacentric elements, whose length gradually decreases (in the seventh pair the centromere borders on a submetacentric position). The Castello Pino population is characterized by diploid and hyperdiploid individuals, that reproduce sexually or by fission. Its karyotype {{is similar to the}} one observed in Paradojo strain, except for the fact that, in most samples, the third pair is polymorphic. In diploid specimens, this latter pair consists of two heteromorphous elements, one metacentric and identical to that described in the preceding population and the other submetacentric, at the border of subtelocentric. This heterobrachial chromosome has never been observed in a homozygous condition. On the other hand, hyperdiploid specimens, that are characterized by a gradual increase in chromosome number (up to 30 32 elements), have never been observed with more than two submetacentrics. B-chromosomes are also present in both diploid and hyperdiploid individuals. Specimens from Giocca are tetraploid (or aneutetraploid), sexual and pseudogamous; the third quartet consists of four submefacentric (at the border of subtelocentric) chromosomes. These elements are similar to the heterobrachial chromosome observed in Castello Pino population. The origin (through a pericentric inversion) of the heterobrachial chromosome is put forward and the different conditions (<b>homozygoty</b> and heterozygoty) in Castello Pino and Giocca strains are discussed. A comparative analysis has also been carried out with the data collected by other Authors on Dugesia gonocephala s. s. and different species of the “D. gonocephala group”, which show similar karyological characteristics...|$|E
