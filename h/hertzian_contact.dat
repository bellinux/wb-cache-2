40|$|The thermal {{conductance}} of <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contacts</b> {{is of great}} importance to cryogenic spacecraft mechanisms such as the Infra-Red Space Observatory (ISO) and the Far Infra-Red Space Telescope (FIRST). At cryogenic temperatures, cooling of mechanism shafts and associated components occurs via conduction through the bearings.

40|$|AbstractThe {{incremental}} compliances, {{normal and}} tangential, of an interface between rough surfaces are considered. Contacts {{are assumed to}} be elliptic – the shape of <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contacts</b> between any two locally smooth asperities. The ellipses may have diverse eccentricities and random or non-random orientation distribution; in the latter case, the tangential compliance is anisotropic. It is found that the <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contacts</b> and “welded” zones of the same geometry produce the same incremental compliances. Microstructural characteristics ξ of the interface that controls its incremental compliances is identified. For the circular contacts, ξ is the sum ∑Ak where Ak is kth contact area; in the more general case of elliptic contacts, each Ak enters in product with its shape factor dependent on the ellipse aspect ratio. The mentioned in-plane tangential anisotropy is relatively mild, even for parallel strongly elongated elliptic contacts. This is due to weakness of the anisotropy for a single elliptic contact (or external elliptic crack). Comparison of the latter to the internal crack of the same elliptic geometry shows that whereas the anisotropy is mild for both crack types, it is weaker for the external crack, in which case it is also less sensitive to Poisson’s ratio...|$|R

40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{irreversible}} deformation in otherwise brittle solids has been observed in <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contacts.</b> The deformation {{takes the form of}} a distributed damage zone below the contact circle, instead of the conventional Hertzian cone fracture outside. An important manifestation of the damage is an effective “quasi-ductility ” in the indentation stress–strain response. Control of the associated brittle–ductile transition is effected by incorporation of weak interfaces, large and elongate grains, and high internal stresses in the ceramic microstructure.

40|$|Due to the {{non-linearity}} of <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contacts,</b> {{the speed}} of sound in granular matter increases with pressure. Under gravity, the non-linear elastic description predicts that acoustic propagation is only possible through surface modes, called Rayleigh-Hertz modes and guided by the index gradient. Here we directly evidence these modes in a controlled laboratory experiment and use them to probe the elastic properties of a granular packing under vanishing confining pressure. The shape and the dispersion relation of both transverse and sagittal modes are compared to the prediction of non-linear elasticity that includes finite size effects. This allows to test the existence of a shear stiffness anomaly close to the jamming transition. Comment: 4 pages 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{under study}} consists in that, in an inhomogeneous material with nonlinearity {{caused by the}} presence of soft defects (the so-called "nonclassical" nonlinearity), cascade nonlinear effects are fairly strong and may even become comparable to the first-order effects. Similar cascade effects in media with a common nonlinearity of the crystal lattice are much weaker. This difference can be used as an important diagnostic indicator in nondestructive testing. Experimental data obtained for samples with cracks, which exhibit both ordinary modulation and cross-modulation effects, as well as a cascade cross modulation, are presented.

40|$|Due to the {{non-linearity}} of <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contacts,</b> {{the speed}} of sound $c$ in granular matter is expected to increase with pressure as $P^{ 1 / 6 }$.

50|$|Different {{materials}} can behave in quite {{different ways in}} impact when compared with static loading conditions. Ductile materials like steel tend to become more brittle at high loading rates, and spalling may occur on the reverse side to the impact if penetration doesn't occur.

Projectiles apply a <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contact</b> stress at the point of impact to a solid body, with compression stresses under the point, but with bending loads a short distance away.

50|$|Today, most cams have {{mirror image}} (symmetric) {{profiles}} with identical {{positive and negative}} acceleration while opening and closing valves. However, some high speed (in terms of engine RPM) motors now employ asymmetrical cam profiles in order to quickly open valves and set them back in their seats more gently to reduce wear. As well, production vehicles have employed asymmetrical cam lobe profiles since the late 1940s, {{as seen in the}} 1948 Ford V8. In this motor both the intake and exhaust profiles had an asymmetric design. More modern applications of asymmetrical camshafts include Cosworth's 2.3 liter crate motors, which use aggressive profiles to reach upwards of 280 brake horsepower. An asymmetric cam either opens or closes valves more slowly than it could, speed being limited by <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contact</b> stress between curved cam and flat tappet from accelerating the mass of valve, tappet and spring.|$|E
40|$|Gear {{theory is}} re-examined {{and we find}} optimal shapes for gears. As {{optimality}} criteria, we allow: (1) minimal frictional losses (highest efficiency) assuming linear law of friction or (2) uniform maximum stress (it will wear out slowly and last the longest) assuming <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contacts</b> or (3) uniform maximal temperature, assuming {{we are in a}} high power limit in which all heat is removed by the lubricant. Some other criteria which have been used before are that (4) mis-spacing the gears still yields perfect gear action with the desired speed ratio or (5) minimal vibration in the low friction limit. Both (4) and (5) lead to "involute gears" which are the standard in engineering practice. Criteria 1, 2, and 3 lead to apparently new gear-tooth forms.

40|$|This work {{determines the}} {{location}} of the greatest elastic distress in spherical and cylindrical <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contacts</b> based upon the distortion energy and the maximum shear stress theories. The ratios between the maximum pressure, the von Mises stress, and the maximum shear stress are determined and fitted by empirical formulations {{for a wide range of}} the Poisson ratio, which represents material compressibility. Some similarities exist between cylindrical and spherical contacts, where for many metallic materials the maximum von Mises or shear stresses emerge beneath the surface. However, in cylindrical contact if any of the materials is excessively compressible then the maximum von Mises stress appears at the surface. The corresponding Poisson ratios are found. The critical forces that cause yielding onset, and the corresponding interferences and radius or half-width contact are derived along with the maximum stored strain energy. It is shown that the distressing stresses decrease as Poisson’s ratio increases (i. e., as the material approaches incompressibility). The results obtained herein are then used to calibrate FEA meshes intended for cases that do not have closed-form solutions. 2...|$|R

50|$|Most {{production}} crankshafts use {{induction hardened}} bearing surfaces, since that method gives good results with low costs. It also allows the crankshaft to be reground without re-hardening. But high performance crankshafts, billet crankshafts in particular, {{tend to use}} nitridization instead. Nitridization is slower and thereby more costly, and in addition it puts certain demands on the alloying metals in the steel {{to be able to}} create stable nitrides. The advantage of nitridization is that it can be done at low temperatures, it produces a very hard surface, and the process leaves some compressive residual stress in the surface, which is good for fatigue properties. The low temperature during treatment is advantageous in that it doesn’t have any negative effects on the steel, such as annealing. With crankshafts that operate on roller bearings, the use of carburization tends to be favored due to the high <b>Hertzian</b> <b>contact</b> stresses in such an application. Like nitriding, carburization also leaves some compressive residual stresses in the surface.|$|E

Specifically, we study how open channels – allowing a fluid to flow through an interface – close with increasing load. To this end we first study how a single open channel closes and gets blocked when the local pressure increases (or the strength of the adhesive interaction, which has a similar effect). Blockage essentially happens when two previously isolated contact patches coalesce to a single patch.
