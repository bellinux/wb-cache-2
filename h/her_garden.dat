5|$|By the mid-1980s, Cameron was {{focusing}} to {{a greater}} extent on her family life, particularly in looking after her grandchildren, who were known to go joyriding in her jeep. Neighbors recall her playing a Celtic harp in <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> and slowly walking her dog around the block while smoking a joint of marijuana. At one point, she was arrested for cultivating cannabis in her home. Cameron became a regular practitioner of Tai chi, took part in group sessions in Bronson Park under the tutelage of Marshall Ho'o, and earned a teaching certificate in the subject. She became very interested in José Argüelles' The Mayan Factor and Charles Musès' The Lion Path, and undertook the Neo-shamanic practices endorsed in the latter. She was also influenced by claims made in the writings of archaeologist Marija Gimbutas about a prehistoric matriarchal society devoted to a goddess. Cameron was very interested in A. S. Raleigh's Woman and Superwoman, taped her own reading of it, and sent copies to her friends and local public radio for broadcast. Throughout all of these disparate spiritual interests, she retained faith in the Thelemic ideas of Crowley.|$|E

5|$|Naomi Canning is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the Australian soap opera Neighbours, played by Morgana O'Reilly. Naomi was introduced as {{the daughter of}} established character Sheila Canning (Colette Mann), after producers decided they wanted to explore her background further. O'Reilly filmed her first audition in <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> in Sydney, before flying to Melbourne to audition in the studio. She competed with five other actresses for the part, but she believed that she was meant to get the role as Naomi is her middle name. A week after the second audition, O'Reilly's agent informed her that she had won the role. O'Reilly then relocated to Melbourne and began filming her first scenes in November 2013. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 25 March 2014. The character departed on 2 October 2015, following O'Reilly's decision to pursue new acting roles.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the Allied withdrawal, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of their dead had to be left on the battlefield. Here they were buried in simple field graves (some little more than their own slit trenches) or in small mass graves dug by the Germans. Kate Ter Horst, whose house was used as a first aid post during the battle, found the graves of 57 men in <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> when she returned after the war. After Arnhem was liberated in April 1945, Grave Registration Units of the British 2nd Army moved into the area and began to locate the Allied dead. A small field north of Oosterbeek was offered on perpetual loan by the Netherlands government to the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission) in June 1945 and the dead were reburied there. Many of those killed during Arnhem's liberation were also buried at the same site. The cemetery was completed in February 1946, originally with the graves marked by metal crosses, although these were replaced by headstones in 1952. Most of the German dead were buried in the SS Heroes Cemetery near Arnhem after the battle, but reburied in Ysselsteyn German war cemetery after the war.|$|E

Under the Roman Empire, many villas were {{constructed}} there, after Agrippina the Elder (14 BC - 18 October AD 33) drained the area and laid out <b>her</b> <b>gardens</b> in the early 1st century AD. In AD 40, her son, Emperor Caligula (31 August AD 12-24 January AD 41; r. 37-41) built in <b>her</b> <b>gardens</b> a circus for charioteers (AD 40) that was later completed by Nero, the Circus Gaii et Neronis, usually called, simply, the Circus of Nero.|$|R

25|$|The {{garden of}} Munstead Wood became widely {{known as a}} result of Jekyll's {{descriptions}} and photographs, in her books such as Wood and Garden (1899), Home and Garden (1900), and Colour in the Flower Garden (1908), and in her many articles, particularly in Country Life and William Robinson's magazines The Garden and Gardening Illustrated. William Robinson was a frequent visitor. Jekyll's long relationship with Country Life began when proprietor Edward Hudson first visited Munstead Wood in 1899. <b>Her</b> <b>garden</b> was notably recorded in Country Life in subsequent years by photographer Charles Latham and Herbert Cowley.|$|E
25|$|Only 20 {{minutes after}} escaping, Straffen came up a private drive in Crowthorne and {{approached}} Mrs. Doris Spencer, {{who was in}} <b>her</b> <b>garden.</b> He asked her for a drink of water, which she gave him and then discussed the proximity of Broadmoor {{and the likelihood of}} escapes. After 10 minutes, he left. An hour and a half later, he reached Farley Hill, and at about five o'clock, Straffen came to the point where 5-year-old Linda Bowyer was riding her bicycle around the village. Within half an hour, Bowyer was dead.|$|E

50|$|From 1881, {{when she}} {{laid out the}} gardens for Munstead House, built for her mother by John James Stevenson, Jekyll {{provided}} designs or planned planting for some four hundred gardens. More than half were directly commissioned, but many were created in collaboration with architects such as Lutyens and Robert Lorimer. Most of <b>her</b> <b>gardens</b> are lost. A small number have been restored, including <b>her</b> own <b>garden</b> at Munstead Wood, the gardens of Hestercombe House, and the garden at the Manor House in Upton Grey that she designed for the magazine editor Charles Holme.|$|R
25|$|Colonists' {{hopes of}} peace rose {{over the summer}} of 1830-31 as Aboriginal attacks fell to a low level and the Colonial Times {{newspaper}} speculated that their enemy had either been wiped out or frightened into inaction. But the north remained a dangerous place: on 29 January a Dairy Plains woman was murdered—three months after her husband {{had died in a}} similar attack—and in March a mother carrying her infant was fatally speared while working in <b>her</b> <b>garden</b> on the East Tamar. Though the number of attacks in 1831 was {{less than a third of}} those the previous year—a total of 70, compared with 250 in 1830—settlers remained so fearful that many men refused to go out to work.|$|E
25|$|Her {{losing streak}} to American wrestlers was not {{exclusive}} to MsChif and Melissa though. In March she put aside her longstanding rivalry with Jetta to team up against Allison Danger and Sara Del Rey at Ring of Honor's Liverpool show Fifth Year Festival: Finale. Allison Danger used the victory {{to bid for}} Black's title, gaining a chance at the Women's Championship during an RQW event; Black would retain the belt after the match went to a fifteen-minute time limit draw. Eden Black then began to make regular appearances at Danger's all-female Shimmer Women Athletes in Chicago eventually picking up a win over an American athlete {{in the form of}} Rain, who submitted to <b>her</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden hold on Volume 9. In June at Shimmer's Volume 11 event, Black was entered into a knock-out tournament to crown the first Shimmer Champion but lost in the first round to Rain's fellow Minnesota Home Wrecking Crew member Lacey; incidentally these two would later team up with Jetta to form The International Home Wrecking Crew. The day after this, at Volume 12 Nikki Roxx pinned her in a four-way match with the Barbie Crusher. On Volume 13, taped that same day, Black had a chance to settle an old score when she fought Lexie Fyfe, who had beaten her early on in her career in 2004. Once again it was <b>her</b> <b>Garden</b> of Eden submission which led her to victory. Black's success continued onto Volume 14 in October, where she again forced her opponent, this time Amber O'Neal, to tap out to the Garden of Eden. In her last Shimmer appearance to date, she teamed with MsChif and Daizee Haze in a six-woman tag team contest in the debut match of the International Home Wrecking Crew. Though Black did not secure the victory herself, she was on the winning team and it was her rival Jetta who was pinned after 25 minutes following Haze's Heart punch/Yakuza kick combination.|$|E

She later regretted it and asked Ignacio to dump Patsy. He refuses to live by Maxine's ever changing rules and confronts her with a marriage proposal as a solution, which she accepts.|$|E
