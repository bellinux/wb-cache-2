40|$|Increasing {{technological}} advances {{have resulted in}} the recognition of a range of genetic conditions not traditionally seen by clinical genetics teams. This has implications for the education of other healthcare professionals who may have insufficient knowledge to identify or support families with these conditions. The national genetic diabetes nurse (GDN) project, which trains diabetes specialist nurses (DSNs), was started in 2002 to increase awareness of monogenic <b>diabetes</b> <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> professionals across the UK. This paper describes the development and evaluation of the first 10 years of this project, indicating that GDNs have increased diagnostic referral rates and supported local families through diagnosis and treatment changes across the UK.

40|$|Background: {{aggression}} against healthcare workers is an alarming issue worldwide. However, there {{is lack of}} data on psychological vulnerability factors (such as personality traits, attachment style) which can constitute a risk or a protective factor for being a victim of an episode {{of violence in the}} health sector. Methods/design: the present protocol is a cross-sectional study on prevalence and characteristics of violent episodes experienced by nursing students in the clinical setting. Its aim is to identify risk and protective factors for becoming a victim of verbal and/or physical aggression <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers. <b>Participants</b> will undergo an intensive battery of psychometric tests, dealing with episodes of aggression in the previous year, attachment style, personality traits, perceived stress, health related quality of life and job strain. Conclusions: the findings derived from this study may be of value in identifying vulnerability factors in experiencing an episode of aggression in the health sector. In this respect, it is a step towards the development of valid training and support focused on health workers, aimed at teaching them how to modulate and manage their vulnerability factors in an efficient way. ...|$|R

This study estimates the importance of work and lifestyle as risk factors for developing <b>diabetes</b> mellitus <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers and explores the association of work factors and obesity, which is a risk factor for diabetes. Methods: Questionnaire-based prospective cohort study among 7, 305 health care workers followed for seven years in the Danish National Diabetes Register. We used bivariate comparisons to give an unadjusted estimate of associations, followed by adjusted survival analysis and logistic regression models to estimate the influences of potential risk factors related to job, health and lifestyle on diabetes and obesity. Results: During seven years of follow up, 3. 5 % of participants developed diabetes, associated with obesity (HR = 6. 53; 95 % CI 4. 68 – 9. 10), overweight (HR = 2. 89; CI 2. 11 – 3. 96) age 50 – 69 y (HR = 2. 27; 95 % CI 1. 57 – 3. 43) and high quality of leadership (HR = 1. 60; CI 1. 19 – 2. 16).

The D,test was performed for detection of ICR isolates with Clinical Laboratory Standard Inst itute guidelines. Results: Of the 114 S. aureus isolated, 20. 2 % represented MRSA. The occurrence o f MRSA were significantly higher <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> wor ker than community individuals [32. 7 % (18 / 55) vs. 6. 9 % (5 / 59) ] (p= 0. 001).

Methods: To investigate the relationship between job stress, affective commitment, and presenteeism, structural equation modeling was used to analyze a sample of 1392 healthcare workers from 11 Class A tertiary hospitals in eastern, central, and western China. The mediating effect of affective commitment on the association between job stress and presenteeism was examined with the Sobel test. Results: Job stress was high {{and the level of}} presenteeism was moderate <b>among</b> <b>healthcare</b> workers. Challenge stress and hindrance stress were strongly correlated (β = 0. 62; p < 0. 05). Affective commitment was significantly and directly inversely correlated with presenteeism (β = − 0. 27; p < 0. 001). Challenge stress was significantly positively correlated with affective commitment (β = 0. 15; p < 0. 001) but not with presenteeism. Hindrance stress was significantly inversely correlated with affective commitment (β = − 0. 40; p < 0. 001) but was significantly positively correlated with presenteeism (β = 0. 26; p < 0. 001).

40|$|Women with {{diabetes}} need {{to plan for}} pregnancy {{if they are to}} reduce their risk of poor pregnancy outcome. While care providers have focused on setting up specialist pre-pregnancy planning clinics to help women prepare for pregnancy, the majority of women do not attend, entering pregnancy unprepared. A major barrier to accessing this care, and a consequence of poor preconception counselling, is a lack of knowledge as to the need to plan and the reasons why. This project addressed an urgent need to raise awareness of the importance of planning for pregnancy <b>among</b> women with <b>diabetes</b> and <b>among</b> the <b>healthcare</b> professionals (HCPs) caring for them. Focus groups with the target groups informed the development of a preconception counselling resource for women {{with diabetes}}. Originally produced as a DVD (Diabetes UK funding), this resource has been embedded in routine care in Northern Ireland (NI) since 2010. A subsequent service evaluation of pregnancy planning indicators undertaken across all five antenatal-metabolic clinics in NI indicated that women who viewed the resource were better prepared for pregnancy. In order to increase the positive impact of the resource and to ensure longer term sustainability the DVD was converted to a website, www. womenwithdiabetes. net (Public Health Agency NI funding). The evaluation also highlighted that women with type 2 diabetes were a hard to reach group. As these women are often cared for outside of specialist clinics, it is pertinent that all HCPs caring for women with diabetes are {{aware of the importance of}} preconception counselling. Funding also supported the development of an e-learning continuing professional development (CPD) resource within the website. The e-learning resource has since been embedded into existing CPD programmes and is an important tool to ensure that all HCPs caring for women with diabetes are empowered to provide preconceptio...|$|R

Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and determinants of <b>diabetes</b> <b>among</b> adults aged 50  years and above in Ghana. Methods A cross sectional study based on data collected from Study of Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) Wave 1 from 2007 to 2008. Data was collected from 5565 respondents of whom 4135 were aged 50 + years identified using a multistage stratified clusters design. Bivariate and hierarchical multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association of the determinants and diabetes. Results The weighted prevalence of <b>diabetes</b> <b>among</b> the adults aged 50  years and above in Ghana was 3. 95 % (95 % Confidence Interval: 3. 35 – 4. 55) with the prevalence being insignificantly higher in females than males (2. 16 %, 95 % CI: 1. 69 – 2. 76 vs. 1. 73 %, 95 % CI: 1. 28 – 2. 33). Low level of physical activity (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 2. 11, 95 % CI: 1. 21 – 3. 69) and obesity (AOR 4. 81, 95 % CI: 1. 92 – 12. 0) were associated with increased odds of <b>diabetes</b> <b>among</b> women while old age (AOR 2. 58, 95 % CI: 1. 29 – 5. 18) and university (AOR 12. 8, 95 % CI: 4. 20 – 39. 1), secondary (AOR 3. 61, 95 % CI: 1. 38 – 9. 47) and primary education (AOR 2. 71, 95 % CI: 1. 02 – 7. 19) were associated with increased the odds of <b>diabetes</b> <b>among</b> men. Conclusion The prevalence of <b>diabetes</b> <b>among</b> old adults shows a similar trend with that of the general population.
