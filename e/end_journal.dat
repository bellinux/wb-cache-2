5000|$|Conway's first work {{in journalism}} {{was done on}} the Rochester Daily Union and Advertiser. In 1875, she {{commenced}} a Catholic monthly, contributing poems and moral tales under the pen name of [...] "Mercedes" [...] to other Catholic journals from spare hours after editing her monthly, and teaching in the convent; She edited the West <b>End</b> <b>Journal,</b> a religious monthly, for five years. Conway served as assistant editor of Buffalo's Catholic Union and Times from 1880 to 1883. In that year, she was invited to visit Boston to recuperate from illness. There, she met the editor who had given her the earliest recognition for her poems by paying with a check, John Boyle O'Reilly. After an opportune vacancy occurred with {{the staff of the}} The Pilot, O'Reilly offered it to Conway, who accepted and started her new job in the autumn of 1883. Besides a liberal salary, opportunities for outside literary work were often put in Conway's direction by O'Reilly. Two years previous to that change, in 1881, Conway had gathered her poems into a volume, published with the title, On the Sunrise Slope. Conway also edited Clara Erskine Clement Waters' collection, called Christian Symbols and Stories of the Saints as Illustrated in Art.|$|E

We define the quadratic duality for algebras with nonhomogeneous relations; the duality between the algebra of differential operators and the multiplicative de Rham complex is a classical example. The scalar part of the relations is interpreted as the curvature. Chern classes of nonhomogeneneous quadratic algebras are introduced as certain obstructions; the Chern-Simons classes are also discussed. The Poincare-Birkhoff-Witt theorem is considered {{in the context of}} the duality, and its simple proof is given.

40|$|Building on {{economic}} and social exchange theories, this study develops an integrated model in which curtailing opportunism in international joint ventures (IJVs) requires four interrelated sets of suppressing forces: (1) contractual ordering (contractual inclusiveness and contractual obligatoriness); (2) structural ordering (managerial governance and equity captiveness); (3) relational ordering (interparty attachment and boundary-spanner ties); and (4) justice ordering (procedural justice and distributive justice). Using a sample of 192 IJVs in an emerging market, this study finds general support for our theoretical model. Our research validates that countering opportunism involves a system-wide effort that integrates {{economic and social}} mandates, unifies ex ante and ex post mechanisms, controls both egoistic and non-egoistic motivations, and combines organizational-level and individual-level forces. For partners from individualist cultures, economic ordering forces (contractual and structural) are stronger than social ordering forces (relational and justice) in relation to opportunism resistance, whereas for partners from a collectivistic culture, social ordering forces are relatively stronger than economic ordering forces for this <b>end.</b> <b>Journal</b> of International Business Studies (2007) 38, 855 – 877. doi: 10. 1057 /palgrave. jibs. 8400300...|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} of the cylinders is also unusual. The V4 has the rear bank of cylinders paired closely together, with the big ends of their connecting rods on the inner sides of the crank journals. The forward bank of cylinders is conversely set outboard of the rear bank, with the big <b>end</b> <b>journals</b> mounted on the outer sides of the crank journals. This design allows for a much narrower engine at the rear, which makes the bike slimmer where it contacts the rider, and allows an easier reach to the ground from the seat.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 123 - 132 Two similar large steam {{turbines}} in an ethylene plant are profiled. One drives the cracked gas compressor train {{and the other}} drives the propylene refrigeration compressor. The two machines are similar and this paper concentrates on the turbine driving the cracked gas compressors. Both turbines {{had a history of}} high vibration, short bearing life, and unusual sensitivity to thermal changes and imbalance due to operation near the second critical speed. In addition, numerous blade failures had occurred. When additional turbine performance was required, a complete review of the entire turbine including the blade designs, rotordynarnics, and governor operation was commissioned. The performance upgrade included new blading, disks, seals, and other changes to the steam path. A turning gear was added for slow-roll operation to relieve thermal effects and rotor bow. A technique was developed for mounting the turbine disks on the rotor to minimize axial disk runout and local couple imbalances. The high bearing temperatures and high vibration issues were addressed with changes in shaft and bearing designs. A submerged arc welding process increased the governor <b>end</b> <b>journal</b> diameter from 51 / 4 inches to 7 inches. A rotordynamic optimization analysis resulted in replacing the tilting pad bearing on the governor end with an offset-half lobed journal bearing. The tilting pad bearings on the exhaust end of the turbines were retained but redesigned for optimum performance. Interchangeability of bearings between the two machines was maintained. These shaft and bearing changes resulted in a significant reduction in babbitt temperature, shaft vibration, and imbalance sensitivity as well as control of the second critical speed. The interaction of the rotor with the foundation substructure was found to be significant, and its inclusion in the analysis was required to properly design the optimized bearings. The blade design changes and steam path changes produced a more reliable design and greater than the required extra power. The addition of a turning gear drive has eliminated the thermal bow problems. A new electronic governor system has eliminated the wear associated with the original hydraulic governor. Both turbines are now operating very smoothly at the capacity of the production facility...|$|E

5000|$|Many [...] "tuning" [...] firms {{producing}} [...] "billet" [...] cranks misunderstand {{the design}} criteria of counterbalance weights. They produce cranks that although made from better materials lack sufficient counter weights and deflect more than OEM standard at high rpm. Other [...] "tuning" [...] firms offer [...] "lightening" [...] and [...] "knife edging" [...] of OEM cranks, this is largely {{at the expense}} of the counterbalance weights. To restore the couple and reduce crankshaft deflection back to OEM spec further work has to undertaken, either installing slugs of high density metal (tungsten) in the counterweights or core drilling the big <b>end</b> <b>journals.</b> For both billet and re-worked OEM cranks if the deflection is greater than OEM spec the results will be poor fatigue and bearing life. For worst cases this may require frequent engine tear downs to replace bearing shells when the crank rubs on the bearing and seasonal replacement of the crank. All of the rotating couple due to crank throw and rotating portion of con-rod and 1/2 the reciprocating couple should be countered. As the balance mass is dependent on the mass of the piston and con-rods if these are changed (for lighter after-market items) then the effect on the couple should be calculated and corrected. Any reputable maker of billet or re-worked cranks should be able to either specify the weights of con-rods and pistons or correct the crank counter weights to suit con-rods and pistons.|$|R
