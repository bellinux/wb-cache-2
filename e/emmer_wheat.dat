50|$|Because of the {{usefulness}} of wheat glutens, genetic studies have largely focused on wheat genetics. Wheat has three genomes (AABBDD) and it can encode for many variations of the same protein, even in the gliadin subcategories many types of gliadin per cultivar, X = genome (A, B, or D genome chromosomes (1 to 7)). The A and B genomes are derived from wild <b>emmers</b> <b>wheat</b> {{which in turn is}} a natural digenomic species that contains a Triticum monococcum- and Aegilops speltoides-like genome. The D genome is derived from the extant species Aegilops tauschii strangulatum.|$|R
25|$|Finally, the Sumerians {{ushered in}} {{domestication}} with intensive agriculture and irrigation. <b>Emmer</b> <b>wheat,</b> barley, sheep (starting as mouflon), and cattle (starting as aurochs) were foremost among the species cultivated and raised {{for the first}} time on a grand scale.|$|E
25|$|Wild {{species of}} barley and <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> were domesticated and {{cultivated}} in the Jordan River Valley {{as early as}} the 9th millennium BCE. Archaeologists have found the carbonized seeds of two kinds of primitive wheat, einkorn and emmer, and two-rowed barley, in the earliest levels of digs at Jericho, one of the first cities in the world.|$|E
25|$|<b>Emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> (triticum dicoccum) was {{initially}} {{the most widespread}} variety of wheat, as it grew well in the warm climate and was resistant to fungal rot. It was high yielding, with large grains and relatively high amounts of gluten, and bread made from <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> flour was thus fairly light in texture. However, emmer required time-consuming pounding or roasting to remove its husk, and during the Iron Age, durum wheat (triticum durum), a descendent of emmer, gradually replaced emmer and became the favored grain for making fine flour. Durum grew well in the rich soil of the larger valleys of the central and northern areas of the country, where rainfall exceeded 225 millimeters per year, was higher yielding than emmer, and its grains released more easily from the chaff. It could therefore {{be separated from the}} husk without roasting or pounding first, thus reducing the work required for threshing, and also leaving most of the grains whole, which was better for longer storage.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy was}} unspecialised {{agriculture}} and pastoralism. Crops included <b>emmer,</b> einkorn, dwarf <b>wheat,</b> and barley. Animals included cattle, pigs, sheep and goats.|$|R
25|$|As {{with all}} {{varieties}} and hybrids of <b>wheat,</b> <b>emmer</b> is unsuitable {{for people with}} gluten-related disorders, such as celiac disease, non-celiac gluten sensitivity and wheat allergy sufferers, among others.|$|R
50|$|There {{are very}} few {{discovered}} settlements, {{which led to the}} traditional view of this culture as exclusively nomadic pastoralists. However, this view was modified, as some evidence of sedentary farming emerged. Traces of <b>emmer,</b> common <b>wheat</b> and barley were found at a Corded Ware site at Bronocice in south-east Poland. Wheeled vehicles (presumably drawn by oxen) are in evidence, a continuation from the Funnelbeaker culture era.|$|R
25|$|Early Mehrgarh {{residents}} {{lived in}} mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat,</b> jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents {{of the later}} period (5500BCE to 2600BCE) put much effort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. Mehrgarh is probably the earliest known center of agriculture in South Asia.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian bread {{was made}} almost {{exclusively}} from <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat,</b> {{which was more}} difficult to turn into flour than most other varieties of wheat. The chaff does not come off through threshing, but comes in spikelets {{that needed to be}} removed by moistening and pounding with a pestle to avoid crushing the grains inside. It was then dried in the sun, winnowed and sieved and finally milled on a saddle quern, which functioned by moving the grindstone back and forth, rather than with a rotating motion.|$|E
25|$|Aegilops {{appears to}} be basal to several taxa such as Triticum, Ambylopyrum, and Crithopsis. Certain species such as Aegilops speltoides could {{potentially}} represent core variants of the taxa. The generic placement may be {{more a matter of}} nomenclature. Aegilops and Triticum genera are very closely related as the adjacent image illustrates the Aegilops species occupy most of the basal branch points in bread wheat evolution indicating that Triticum genus evolved from Aegilops after an estimated 4 million years ago.

40|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{profiles}} of 145 telial isolates of Puccinia recondita sensu lato (Uredinales: Pucciniaceae), from dif-ferent host species and different geographical origins, {{were determined by}} gas chromatography (GC). The iso-lates clustered into three different GC groups, according to consistent quantitative differences in their fatty acid compositions. Isolates collected from bread, durum and wild <b>emmer</b> <b>wheats,</b> with Thalictrum speciosissimum (Ra-nunculaceae) as aecial host, regardless of their geographi-cal origin, formed one group. The second group consists of isolates collected on Aegilops spp. and some from du-rum wheat, all alternating on Boraginaceous species. The third group contains isolates collected on rye, alternating on Boraginaceae. The grouping of P. recondita isolates by fatty acid profiles coincides with a similar one, suggested by several studies involving pathogenicity on alternate hosts, cross ability, teliospore dimensions and relative DNA content of haploid spores. It is concluded that the three groups represent two species and one subspecies: Puccinia triticina (on wheats, group 1), P. recondita sub-sp. recondita (on rye, group 3) and P. recondita subsp. aegilopis (on Aegilops spp. and durum wheat, group 2) ...|$|R
50|$|Wild <b>emmer</b> and einkorn <b>wheat</b> {{were found}} in the first layers of excavation. Wheat, barley, lentils and peas were found {{cultivated}} along with wild varieties in later levels. Silos for storing grain were also found at these levels. The first layers of the excavations showed evidence of wild <b>emmer</b> and einkorn <b>wheat.</b> It was shown from the findings that these two cereals were taken into cultivation first, followed by the lentils, peas and veitch and afterwards barley. This evidence led Willem van Zeist to suggest that domesticated crops did not enter the area around the Taurus mountains and Northern Syria until the middle of the PPNB.|$|R
25|$|Along with einkorn <b>wheat,</b> <b>emmer</b> {{was one of}} {{the first}} crops domesticated in the Near East. It was widely {{cultivated}} in the ancient world, but is now a relict crop in mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.|$|R
25|$|Microscopy of beer residue {{points to}} a {{different}} method of brewing where bread was not used as an ingredient. One batch of grain was sprouted, which produced enzymes. The next batch was cooked in water, dispersing the starch and then the two batches were mixed. The enzymes began to consume the starch to produce sugar. The resulting mixture was then sieved to remove chaff, and yeast (and probably lactic acid) was then added to begin a fermentation process that produced alcohol. This method of brewing is still used in parts of non-industrialized Africa. Most beers were made of barley {{and only a few}} of <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat,</b> but so far no evidence of flavoring has been found.|$|E
25|$|Cultivation {{of wheat}} {{began to spread}} beyond the Fertile Crescent after about 8000BCE. Jared Diamond traces the spread of {{cultivated}} <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> starting in the Fertile Crescent sometime before 8800 BCE. Archaeological analysis of wild emmer indicates that it was first cultivated in the southern Levant with finds dating {{back as far as}} 9600BCE. Genetic analysis of wild einkorn wheat suggests that it was first grown in the Karacadag Mountains in southeastern Turkey. Dated archeological remains of einkorn wheat in settlement sites near this region, including those at Abu Hureyra in Syria, suggest the domestication of einkorn near the Karacadag Mountain Range. With the anomalous exception of two grains from Iraq ed-Dubb, the earliest carbon-14 date for einkorn wheat remains at Abu Hureyra is 7800 to 7500 yearsBCE.|$|E
25|$|The Euphrates {{flows through}} a number of {{distinct}} vegetation zones. Although millennia-long human occupation {{in most parts of the}} Euphrates basin has significantly degraded the landscape, patches of original vegetation remain. The steady drop in annual rainfall from the sources of the Euphrates toward the Persian Gulf is a strong determinant for the vegetation that can be supported. In its upper reaches the Euphrates flows through the mountains of Southeast Turkey and their southern foothills which support a xeric woodland. Plant species in the moister parts of this zone include various oaks, pistachio trees, and Rosaceae (rose/plum family). The drier parts of the xeric woodland zone supports less dense oak forest and Rosaceae. Here can also be found the wild variants of many cereals, including einkorn wheat, <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat,</b> oat and rye. South of this zone lies a zone of mixed woodland-steppe vegetation. Between Raqqa and the Syroâ€“Iraqi border the Euphrates flows through a steppe landscape. This steppe is characterised by white wormwood (Artemisia herba-alba) and Chenopodiaceae. Throughout history, this zone has been heavily overgrazed due to the practicing of sheep and goat pastoralism by its inhabitants. Southeast of the border between Syria and Iraq starts true desert. This zone supports either no vegetation at all or small pockets of Chenopodiaceae or Poa sinaica. Although today nothing of it survives due to human interference, research suggests that the Euphrates Valley would have supported a riverine forest. Species characteristic of this type of forest include the Oriental plane, the Euphrates poplar, the tamarisk, the ash and various wetland plants.|$|E
50|$|There is {{a variety}} of {{evidence}} to suggest that some agricultural activity took place inside the settlement. Especially the edge of the oppidum may have served as fields. But during its heyday, the oppidum must also have depended on agricultural produce from surrounding areas. The main cultivated food plants were barley and spelt. Proso millet, einkorn, <b>emmer,</b> avena, <b>wheat</b> and rye were also grown. Lentils, vicia faba, poppy, hazelnut and various fruit were also consumed.|$|R
25|$|Hexaploid wheats {{evolved in}} farmers' fields. Either domesticated <b>emmer</b> or durum <b>wheat</b> hybridized {{with yet another}} wild diploid grass (Aegilops tauschii) to make the {{hexaploid}} wheats, spelt wheat and bread wheat.

40|$|Cultivated wheats include einkorn (2 x), emmer (4 x), durum (4 x). {{and common}} (6 x) wheats. but einkorn and <b>emmer</b> <b>wheats</b> are seid 9 m grown today. Wild einkorn was {{probably}} domesticated in southeastern Turkey and wild emmer {{in the upper}} Jordan Valley. Evidence suggests that hexaploid common wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em TheIl.) was domesticated outside ofthese regions (Harlan, 1975). The origin of wheat is speculative, but a leading theory suggests that hexaploid wheat arose from natural hybridization involviRg three diploid strains.

2500|$|In the Near East, in {{southern}} Mesopotamia in particular, cultivation of <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> {{began to decline}} in the Early Bronze Age, from about 3000 BC, and barley became the standard cereal crop. This has been related to increased salinization of irrigated alluvial soils, of which barley is more tolerant, although this study has been challenged. Emmer had {{a special place in}} ancient Egypt, where it was the main wheat cultivated in Pharaonic times, although cultivated einkorn wheat was grown in great abundance during the Third Dynasty, and large quantities of it were found preserved, along with cultivated <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> and barleys, in the subterranean chambers beneath the Step Pyramid at Saqqara. Neighbouring countries also cultivated einkorn, durum and common wheat. In the absence of any obvious functional explanation, the greater prevalence of <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> in the diet of ancient Egypt may simply reflect a marked culinary or cultural preference, or may reflect growing conditions having changed after the Third Dynasty.

2500|$|Wild emmer is {{native to}} the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East, growing in the grass and {{woodland}} of hill country from modern-day Israel to Iran. [...] The origin of wild emmer has been suggested, without universal agreement among scholars, to be the Karaca Dag mountain region of southeastern Turkey. In 1906, Aaron Aaronsohn's discovery of wild <b>emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> growing in Rosh Pinna (now in Israel) created a stir in the botanical world. <b>Emmer</b> <b>wheat</b> {{has been found in}} archaeological excavations and ancient tombs.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{domestication}} {{has led to}} dramatic morphological and physiological changes in crop species due to adaptation to cultivation and {{to the needs of}} farmers. To investigate the phenotypic architecture of shoot- and root-related traits and quantify the impact of domestication and post-domestication, we examined a collection of 36 wheat genotypes under optimal and nitrogen-starved conditions. These represented three taxa that correspond to key steps in the recent evolution of tetraploid wheat (i. e., wild emmer, <b>emmer,</b> and durum <b>wheat).</b> Overall, nitrogen starvation reduced shoot growth of all genotypes, while it induced the opposite effect on root traits quantified using the automated phenotyping platform GROWSCREEN-Rhizo. We observed an overall increase in all shoot and root growth traits from wild <b>emmer</b> to durum <b>wheat,</b> while <b>emmer</b> was generally very similar to wild emmer, but intermediate between these two subspecies. While the differences in phenotypic diversity due to the effects of domestication were not significant, the post-domestication transition from <b>emmer</b> to durum <b>wheat</b> was marked by a large and significant decrease in the coefficient of variation. In particular, this reduction was very strong at optimal condition, and less intense under nitrogen starvation. Moreover, while at optimal condition both root and shoot traits showed significantly reduced diversity due to post-domestication, under nitrogen starvation the reduced diversity was significant only for shoot traits. Overall, a considerable amount of phenotypic variation was observed in wild emmer and emmer which could be exploited for the development of pre-breeding strategies...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Emmer</b> <b>wheat,</b> {{also known}} as farro {{especially}} in Italy, or hulled wheat, {{is a type of}} awned wheat. [...] Emmer is a tetraploid (2n=4x=28 chromosomes). [...] The domesticated species are Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccum and Triticum turgidum conv. durum. The wild species is called Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides. [...] The principal difference between the wild and the domestic species is that the ripened seed head of the wild species shatters and spreads the seed onto the ground, while in the domesticated emmer, the seed head remains intact, thus making it easier for humans to harvest the grain.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first <b>emmer</b> and einkorn <b>wheat,</b> then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick peas and flax.
