5|$|Following Operation Kraai in 1948, {{in which}} Dutch forces conquered the republican capital at Yogyakarta and {{captured}} {{much of the}} Sukarno government, Soeman was made commander of the guerrilla forces in Riau. Aside from continuing the fight, he was tasked with <b>finding</b> <b>new</b> fighters to support the republican cause. In this mission, he was aided in part by his extensive networks as a long-term schoolteacher, and many of Soeman's fighters were former students of his. Though his troops were underarmed, Soeman led them into combat against Dutch-allied indigene troops several times.|$|E

5|$|In Moldavia, {{agriculture}} and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that <b>finding</b> <b>new</b> land was still preferred to crop rotation. The {{establishment of the}} principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also profit from the transit trade between Poland and the Black Sea ports. The first local coins were minted in 1377, under Peter I Muşat (c.13751391).|$|E
5|$|Today, {{the breed}} is used mainly for meat and logging forested areas {{inaccessible}} to machinery. Since the mid-1990s, colts not intended for breeding, recreational riding, or harness work are heavily fed and {{sent out to}} slaughter {{before the age of}} eighteen months. Fillies are generally used for breeding. The breed association and its breeders are trying to secure the future of the Trait du Nord by <b>finding</b> <b>new</b> markets, especially in the areas of recreational riding, agricultural work, recreational and competitive driving. The breed is involved in several reenactments and folk villages which attract good crowds. The breed is promoted for its use in logging in forests and fragile areas, with professional foresters using them to preserve the value and biodiversity of forested areas.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of such initiatives, Romania {{tended to}} give little {{attention}} to the potential of recruitment in Russia, as many decision-makers were still uncertain about the devotion of Transylvanians and Bukovinans, and worried that they might be welcoming Austro-Hungarian spies into army ranks. Additionally, probably half of the 120,000 men excluded themselves from the pool of recruits, as Austrian loyalists, invalids or men who had reason to fear Austria-Hungary's retaliation. Support from within Romania was therefore weak, and Russian obstruction still had a part to play, but in January the camp was visited by Lieutenant Colonel Constantin Gh. Pietraru of the Romanian Land Forces, on a mission to evaluate the recruitment project. The reversal of fortunes on the Romanian front had brought a Central Powers' invasion into southern Romania, and the Romanian military authority became pressured into <b>finding</b> <b>new</b> soldiers for the defensive action.|$|E

5|$|Seventeen {{days after}} the show, on November 23, Art Barr died in his home in Springfield, Oregon. The {{official}} {{cause of death was}} never officially confirmed, although it was claimed by some sources to be drug-related. Barr and Guerrero were the reigning AAA World Tag Team Champions at the time of Barr's death and AAA opted to retire the championship instead of vacating the championship and <b>finding</b> <b>new</b> champions. Between 1994 and 2007 AAA's primary championship was the Mexican National Tag Team Championship, until AAA brought back the AAA World Tag Team Championship at the 2007 Rey de Reyes show on March 18, 2007. Following When Worlds Collide, AAA owner Antonio Peña was working on a storyline that would have Barr and Guerrero turn on Konnan, turning Konnan tecnico in the process. The start of the storyline was planted during the show, as Barr was not at ringside to help Konnan during the match. The conclusion of the storyline would come at Triplemanía III at Estadio Azteca, where AAA was hoping to sell out the 130,000 seat arena.|$|E
5|$|Tactical design {{management}} addresses the organisation of design resources and design processes. Its {{goal is to}} create a structure for design in the company, bridging the gap between objectives set through strategic {{design management}} and the implementation of design on the operational level. It defines how design is organised within the company. This includes the use of a central body to coordinate different design projects and activities. It deals with defining activities, developing design skills and competencies, managing processes, systems and procedures, assigning of roles and responsibilities, developing innovative products and service concepts, and <b>finding</b> <b>new</b> market opportunities. Outcomes of tactical design management are related {{to the creation of a}} structure for design within the company, to build internal resources and competencies for the implementation of design. Depending on the type of company and industry, the following job titles are associated with this function: tactical design manager, design director, design & innovation manager, brand design manager, new product development (NPD) manager, visual identity manager, and others.|$|E
