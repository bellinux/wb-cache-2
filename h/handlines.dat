5|$|In {{the northwestern}} Atlantic, the roughtail {{stingray}} is listed under Least Concern; {{it is not}} targeted or utilized by commercial fisheries, though inconsequential numbers are captured incidentally in trawls and on demersal longlines. Historically, it was sometimes ground up for fertilizer. In the Mediterranean, intensive fishing occurs in the habitat of the roughtail stingray, and it is caught incidentally by artisanal and commercial fishers using trawls, longlines, gillnets, and <b>handlines.</b> Though no specific data is available on this species, declines of other species and its intrinsic susceptibility to depletion have led it to be assessed as Near Threatened in the region. In the southwestern Atlantic, the roughtail stingray and other large rays are heavily fished using demersal trawls, gillnets, longlines, and hook-and-line; this fishing pressure is liable to increase due to growing commercial interest in using large stingrays for minced fish products. Anecdotal reports suggest that landings of this species are decreasing, leading to a regional assessment of Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Prized for its {{meat and}} fins, the {{porbeagle}} {{has long been}} under heavy fishing pressure. The meat is sold fresh, frozen, or dried and salted, and ranks among the most valuable of any shark: in 1997 and 1998 it had a wholesale price of EUR 5–7/kg, four {{times that of the}} blue shark (Prionace glauca). Most of the demand comes from Europe, though the United States and Japan also import this species. The fins are shipped to East Asia for use in shark fin soup. The remainder of the shark may also be utilized, for production of leather, liver oil, and fishmeal. International trade in the porbeagle appears to be significant, but remains unquantified as shark products tend not to be reported to the species level, and many consist of a mix of various species. This shark is caught most readily on longlines, but is also susceptible to gillnets, driftnets, trawls, and <b>handlines.</b> It is valuable enough to be generally retained when caught as bycatch; if storage space cannot be spared it may be finned and the carcass discarded.|$|E
25|$|The bluestripe snapper is {{commonly}} taken throughout its range by <b>handlines,</b> traps, and gill nets. It is usually marketed fresh, and {{is common in}} the markets of many countries. It {{is one of the}} principal species in the Hawaiian handline fishery, but as noted above, it fetches low prices at market.|$|E
50|$|<b>Handlining</b> is {{also used}} for {{catching}} fresh water fish. Panfish, walleyes, and other freshwater game fish can be caught using <b>handlining</b> fishing techniques. <b>Handlining</b> can be practiced from the shore or from a fishing boat. Walleye anglers practice <b>handlining</b> over moderately deep water in a drifting boat. <b>Handlining</b> is also practiced by ice fishing anglers.|$|R
50|$|Ocean <b>handlining</b> {{is often}} used to catch {{groundfish}} and squid but other species are sometimes caught, including pelagic fish. Sea <b>handlining</b> {{is a good way to}} catch larger oceanic fish.|$|R
40|$|Mackerel {{is one of}} {{the main}} targets of <b>handline</b> fishing in the Tambelan coastal waters, Bintan Regency. The {{mackerel}} catch data were collected by following the <b>handline</b> fishing operation as many as 40 trips from December 2013 to April 2014. The productivity data of <b>handline</b> fishing were collected based on the time of fishing operations (morning, noon, afternoon). The average productivity of <b>handline</b> fishing in the morning, daytime, and afternoon were 0. 051 kg/minutes, 0. 036 kg/minutes and 0. 033 kg/minutes, respectively. <b>Handline</b> fishing productivity in the morning was not significantly different with at the daytime, however there was a significant different in productivity between in the morning and in the afternoon. Whilst, the fishing productivity at the daytime was not significantly different with that in the afternoon...|$|R
25|$|In shallow waters, rafts can be punted with a push pole. They {{can be used}} as {{stealthy}} platforms {{for fishing}} shallow waters around lakes. In sheltered coastal waters, anchored or drifting rafts can become effective fish aggregating devices. Payaos were traditional bamboo rafts used in Southeast Asia as aggregating device. Fishermen {{on the top of the}} raft used <b>handlines</b> to catch tuna.|$|E
25|$|Larger {{commercial}} reef fish, such as {{medium to}} large snapper, grouper, emperor and reef associated jack, are best caught by <b>handlines</b> and longlines. Other resources include aquarium fish, and non invertebrates, such as sea cucumber, lobster, giant clam and black coral. An increase {{in demand for}} reef fish from the tourism industry and overseas markets has raised the level of exploitation of particular reef fish varieties.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere in the spiny {{butterfly}} ray's range, {{it faces}} heavy fishing pressure, including in its coastal nursery areas, and has experienced marked declines. It is assessed as Critically Endangered {{in the southwest}} Atlantic, where it is taken by multispecies trawls, beach-seines, and recreational fishers. Off southern Brazil, catch rates have declined by 99% since 1982, due to fishing occurring year-round. This species is also Critically Endangered in the Mediterranean, {{where it is now}} rare or absent throughout its entire former range, especially along the southern shore such as off Sicily. The comprehensive Mediterranean International Trawl Surveys (MITS) since 1994 have failed to recover any specimens, indicating a massive decline in numbers. In West Africa, this species is assessed as Vulnerable; it is taken intentionally or incidentally by gillnets, shrimp trawls, longlines, and <b>handlines.</b> Reports from artisan fishers and other observers from Mauritania to Guinea have reported a severe drop in abundance, as well as decreasing median size as the adults are removed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Handline</b> fishing, or <b>handlining,</b> is {{a fishing}} {{technique}} where a single fishing line {{is held in}} the hands. It {{is not to be}} confused with handfishing. One or more fishing lures or baited hooks are attached to the line. A hook, fishing lure, or a fishing jig and many times a weight and/or a fishing float can be attached to the line. <b>Handlining</b> is among the oldest forms of fishing and is commonly practiced throughout the world today.|$|R

25|$|The giant {{trevally}} is of high {{importance to}} modern fisheries throughout its range, although quantifying the amounts taken {{is very difficult}} {{due to the lack}} of fishery statistics kept in most of these countries. Hawaii has the best-kept statistics, where the 1998 catch consisted of 10,194 pounds of giant trevally worth around US$12,000. Historically, the species has been taken in far greater numbers, and has been an important food, market and game fish since the early 1900s. However, their exploitation has seen the landings of the species decrease by over 84% since the turn of the century, declining from 725,000lb to 10,000lb in recent catches. FAO statistics of the Asian region record catches between 4,000 and 10,000 tonnes between 1997 and 2007, although this excludes most fisheries which are not monitored or do not discriminate between trevally species. The giant trevally is commercially caught by a number of methods, including hook and line, <b>handlines,</b> gill nets and other types of artisanal traps. The species has also successfully been bred for aquaculture purposes in Taiwan. It is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|E
25|$|The {{crevalle jack}} {{is a highly}} {{important}} species to commercial fisheries throughout its range, with the greatest quantity of the species taken from the eastern Atlantic. In some fisheries, {{it is one of}} the most abundant species and therefore of great importance in these regions. In the Americas, the reported annual catch has ranged between 150 and 1300 tonnes since 1950, with catches since 2000 ranging between 190 and 380 tonnes. Most of the western Atlantic catch is from Florida, although Caribbean fisheries, such as Trinidad, take considerable quantities of the fish. The eastern Atlantic catch statistics do not differentiate longfin crevalle jack from crevalle jack, thus must be considered a composite dataset. This region only comprises catch data from Angola, Ghana, São Tome, and Principe. These catches are much larger than in the east, with hauls of between 1000 and 38 000 tonnes per year recorded since 1950, although catches since 2000 only range between 1900 and 10 200 tonnes. Crevalle jack is taken by a number of fishing methods, including haul seines, gill nets, purse seines, trawls, <b>handlines</b> and trolling lines. The abundance of the species in Trinidad leads to the fish being taken in several quite different types of fishery; demersal trawls, artisanal gill nets and even beach seines, which illustrates the species' importance. In Trinidad, recreational fishermen also may sell their catch, which adds to the overall quantity of fish sold. Crevalle jack is sold at market fresh, frozen, salted, and smoked, and as fishmeal and oil.|$|E
500|$|The {{rough skin}} (called [...] "rubskin") of the {{nursehound}} was once used to polish wood and alabaster, to smooth arrows and barrels, {{and to raise}} the hairs of beaver hats {{as a replacement for}} pumice. Rubskin was so valued that a pound of it was worth a hundredweight of sandpaper. The liver was also used as a source of oil, and the carcasses cut up and used to bait crab traps. The meat of this species is marketed fresh or dried and salted, though it is considered [...] "coarse" [...] in some quarters. In the United Kingdom, {{it is one of the}} species sold under the names [...] "flake", [...] "catfish", [...] "huss" [...] "rock eel", or [...] "rock salmon". In France, it is sold as grande roussette or saumonette, as after being skinned and beheaded it resembles salmon. This species is also sometimes processed into fishmeal, or its fins dried and exported to the Asian market. In European waters, commercial production of this species is led by France, followed by the UK and Portugal; it is caught using bottom trawls, gillnets, bottom set longlines, <b>handlines</b> and fixed bottom nets. In 2004, a total catch of 208 tons was reported from the northeastern Atlantic.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{historical}} {{roots of the}} conflict between commercial <b>handline</b> and inshore bottom trawl fisheries on the eastern Agulhas Bank off the southern Cape coast. It focuses on the early 20 th century, particularly on the regional centre, Mossel Bay, and on Still Bay, a small town which until recently had an important <b>handline</b> kob fishery. The transport opportunities offered by the commercial harbour and railway line encouraged the establishment of industrialized fishing at Mossel Bay. In contrast, the Still Bay fishery originated in the river as a development of the local agricultural economy, only later pushing out to the sea. Marketing was always hampered by the remoteness {{and the lack of}} efficient transportation and refrigeration facilities. Although Mossel Bay handliners had access to ice and transportation, the marketing arrangement of the large trawl companies effectively excluded them from entering markets further afield. Monopolistic vertical integration by the country's largest trawling company further deteriorated the situation of the independent small handliners. While government was uncomfortable with the trawling companies' monopolistic practices, it saw the <b>handline</b> sector as a primitive holdover and therefore did not uphold the rights of <b>handline</b> fishers faced with encroachment by trawlers. The Still Bay fishery remained dependent on middlemen, limiting the profitability of the fishery. A tiny fish processing facility operated during WWII, but by and large the regional council sought to maintain the tourism-oriented image of the town. The development of both towns was strongly shaped by government policy and the development of the trawling sector. While the 20 th century opened with <b>handlining</b> being the dominant mode of fishing, by the 1950 s <b>handline</b> fishing was a marginal economic activity...|$|R
40|$|Around the Hawaiian Islands, {{a variety}} of small and medium-scale {{fisheries}} target bigeye (Thunnus obsesus) and yellowfin tuna (T. albacares) associated with offshore seamounts and weather monitoring buoys, an inshore network of fish aggregating devices (FADs), and natural aggregation sites (Itano and Holland, 2000). These fisheries, conducted from longline, troll and <b>handline,</b> {{and to a lesser}} extent from pole-and-line vessels, provide an important source of revenue for the state (Boggs and Ito, 1993; Ito and Machado, 1999). The small-gear fleet (essentially the trolling and <b>handline</b> vessels) supports recreational and subsistence fisheries for both residents and the tourist industry (Pooley, 1993; Hamilton and Huffman, 1997). An important sector within Hawai‘i’s small-scale commercial fisheries is the offshore <b>handline</b> fishery, which targets mixedspecies aggregations found in association with NOAA offshor...|$|R

500|$|Murray cod were {{originally}} {{the most common}} large native fish in the Murray-Darling basin. Contrary to some fishery department literature, the first serious declines in Murray cod were caused by extremely severe overfishing. In {{the latter half of}} the 1800s and the early 1900s, Murray cod — very large, very long-lived fish — were caught in unimaginable numbers by both commercial and recreational fishermen. For example, one commercial fishing operation commenced on the Murray River near Echuca in 1855, targeting Murray cod over hundreds of kilometres of river, and yet within eight years, grave concerns over the sustainability of this operation, and complaints about the near-absence of Murray cod in their heavily fished grounds, were being raised in the main state newspaper, The Argus. Yet, fishing effort continued to increase in the region, so in the late 1880s and early 1890s, between 40,000 and 150,000kg of mostly Murray cod (between 7,500 and 27,000 fish, at an average weight of 5.5kg) were caught near Echuca. Similarly, in 1883, more than 147,000kg of Murray cod were sent to Melbourne from just one river town (Moama). By the 1920s Murray cod had been overfished to the point where large-scale commercial fishing operations were no longer feasible. Recreational fishermen took similarly excessive hauls during this era, using rods and reels, <b>handlines,</b> setlines, drum nets, gill nets, and even explosives, with hauls often either wasted or illegally sold. Perhaps this extreme overfishing and its impacts of wild Murray cod stocks is best summarised by a short article in the Register News (a South Australian newspaper) in 1929: ...|$|E
2500|$|An airport crash tender, or [...] "crash rig", [...] is a {{specialized}} fire engine {{designed for use}} at aerodromes in aircraft accidents. Some of the features that make the crash rigs unique are their ability to move on rough terrain outside the runway and airport area, large water capacity {{as well as a}} foam tank, a high-capacity pump, and water/foam monitors. Newer ARFF vehicles also incorporate twin agent nozzles/injection systems to inject a stream of Purple-K dry chemical into the AFFF (Aqueous Film Forming Fluroprotein) foam stream, which [...] "flattens" [...] the fire faster. Some also have Halotron tanks with <b>handlines</b> for fires which must be extinguished with a dry chemical similar to the ones which {{can be found in a}} fire extinguisher.
