40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an application of}} photogrammetry on ceramic fragments from two excavation sites located north-west of France. The restitution by photogrammetry of these different fragments allowed reconstructions of the potteries in their original state {{or at least to}} get to as close as possible. We used the 3 D reconstructions to compute some metrics and to generate a presentation support by using a 3 D printer. This work is based on affordable tools and illustrates how 3 D technologies can be quite easily integrated in archaeology process with limited financial resources. 1. INTRODUCTION Today, photogrammetry and 3 D modelling {{are an integral part of}} the methods used in archeology and heritage management. They provide answers to scientific needs in the fields of conservation, preservation, restoration and mediation of architectural, archaeological and cultural heritage [2] [6] [7] [9]. Photogrammetry on ceramic fragments was one of the first applications contemporary of the development of this technique applied in the archaeological community [3]. More recently and due to its democratization, it was applied more generally to artifacts [5]. Finally joined today by the rise of 3 D printing [8] [10], it can restore fragmented artifacts [1] [12]. These examples target one or several particular objects and use different types of equipment that can be expensive. These aspects can put off uninitiated archaeologists. So it would be appropriate to see if these techniques could be generalized to a whole class of geometrically simple and common artifacts, such as ceramics. From these observations, associated to ceramics specialists with fragments of broken ceramics, we aimed at arranging different tools and methods, including photogrammetry, to explore opportunities for a cheap and attainable reconstruction methodology and its possible applications. Our first objective was to establish a protocol for scanning fragments with photogrammetry, and for reconstruction of original ceramics. We used the digital reconstitutions of the ceramics we got following our process to calculate some metrics and to design and 3 D print a display for the remaining fragments of one pottery.

The aim of the Athena project is the sustainable development of ancient Mediterranean theatres, taking into account their relationship with society and heritage institutions. Under the supervision of the Regional Monitoring and Support Unit (RMSU), the Project is funded by the European Commission in the framework of the <b>Euromed</b> <b>Heritage</b> IV program (www. euromedheritage. net), the fourth phase of an action strategy originally established by the EU in the framework of the MEDA measure, {{under the control of the}} EuropeAid Office for Cooperation. Since 1998 <b>Euromed</b> <b>Heritage</b> has spent about 57 million euros on cultural heritage, financing cooperation projects involving different actors (research institutes, universities, government authorities, academics, local communities, etc.) from different Mediterranean countries and working on various aspects of documentation, conservation and management of cultural heritage. Nearly 400 partners on both shores of the Mediterranean have benefited from the program, from the first to the fourth and current edition. It is impossible, however, to describe the aims of Project Athena without first briefly presenting the background to the project. The research activities of the last decade (in which all partners were deeply engaged in the project) have, in fact, highlighted the main points of what could be defined as a new cultural strategy: in this approach, a theatre can always be considered to be part of a wider urban or archaeological complex; and very often the theatre is at the “heart” of these environments exerting a strong pull on the public. Therefore, it is too restrictive to study a theatre in idolisation: quite the contrary, it should always be considered as part of a “cultural cluster,” that is, a set of cultural goods which can help boost “supply” and “demand”...|$|E

This project is financed by the MEDIA Programme of the European Union. Today we can't understand culture in the same manner as anthropologists did in the last century: something static, immutable, a supra-subjective entity. We should see it as something always variant, which is continuely adapting to new circumstances. That is, culture as a continuous negotiation, as something which isn't given by nature but built every day by persons. This fact has two implications ofinterest regarding ourwished culture of peace: 1. The need of abandoning an idea of culture bounded too much to the ethnicist ideologies and which has been a further cause for struggle and intransigent attitudes. 2. The need of recognizing the high versatility of culture. Evidently, it is not too easy to change culture. We can't change cultural traits in the way we can change our shirt or necktie; but we also need don't to carry the burden of cultural traits which are clearly negative for current society. Since culture was not given by nature, we can also try to modify very consciously the cultural e 1 ements which are causes of struggle. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the European Union’s <b>EuroMed</b> <b>Heritage</b> II programme, 2001 - 2004, thirteen partners worked together with London Metropolitan University as co-ordinator within the Mediterranean Voices project. This was designed to research the intangible heritage of these cosmopolitan communities, the ‘glocalisation’ in globalisation, as made manifest through the oral testimonies of the ordinary citizens with respect to everyday life in the city. This paper investigates the tensions arising from (1) translating private interviews onto a highly public medium such as is the IT database without producing ‘reification’ (2) the value of oral history in the museum and how {{it can be used to}} re-value intangible heritage (3) the difficulties of exhibiting information on intangible heritage, based on implicit background knowledge, and designed as ‘triggers’ of memory and reminiscences, to audiences lacking the requisite contextualisation, either for spatial reasons (people from mainland Spain or other countries, new immigrant communities) or for motives associated with time (people of the younger generations who have not been exposed to the reality exhibited). The paper also, and most importantly, analyses (4) the role of the museum as an ‘activator’ of memory and a centre for discussion and promotion of community identity, sense of place and belonging as opposed to its modernist conception as an educator of the ‘uncultured’ masses and archive of encyclopaedic wisdom...|$|E
