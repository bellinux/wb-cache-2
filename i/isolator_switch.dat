Such switches are often found in electrical distribution and industrial applications, where machinery must have its source of driving power removed for adjustment or repair. High-voltage isolation switches are used in electrical substations to allow isolation of apparatus such as circuit breakers, transformers, and transmission lines, for maintenance. The disconnector is usually not intended for normal control of the circuit, but only for safety isolation. Disconnectors can be operated either manually or automatically.|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} an {{observable}} increase in the fitting of photovoltaic (PV) solar panels on the roofs of buildings in the UK over the last decade. The origin of some fires in domestic and commercial properties {{has been attributed to}} PV systems. This thesis examines the ability of fire examiners to recognise and record details of fires believed to have originated from PV systems, as well as investigating the effect of internal heating in direct current (DC) isolators to the point at which they fail. National fire data was examined along with the methods for collecting and collating these data. This clarified that national fire data cannot identify the specifics of electrical fires. Validity of these data was then tested by identifying the confidence and competence in the recognition of the origin of fire, (especially when associated with PV systems), of some fire staff responsible for collecting fire data. This suggests that some fire scenes examiners are not confident in their own ability to recognise fires originating from PV systems. Evidence for fires occurring in PV systems in Kent between 2009 and 2014 was then examined, including a cold case forensic review of the evidence. This provided an indication that a potential common point of failure, which may lead to fire originating from a PV system, was to be found within the DC section of the PV circuits and probably within the DC <b>isolator</b> <b>switch</b> itself. Experimentation revealed that internal heating of a terminal connection can lead to changes of the phase of the insulating material, causing failure of structural integrity and therefore allowing an arc to be established. Observable post fire indicators associated with this mechanism of failure have been identified as well as hydrocarbons evolved from pyrolysis of isolator insulating material. Finally, areas for further experimental research and training of fire staff are suggested as well as the modification of recording mechanisms and building regulations...|$|E

40|$|A fault {{location}} method and a fault clearance strategy {{are presented in}} this paper for medium voltage dc (MVDC) distribution system. MVDC systems are applicable for connection between microgrids (MGs) and integration of renewable energy systems (RESs) to distribution systems.

50|$|The Flexible Plug and Play project, {{according}} to the submission documents, will test a number of so called smart devices on a distribution network {{in order to improve}} its efficiency and to allow more power to flow through it without reinforcement.1) Dynamic Line Rating device. The maximum current an overhead power line can carry is an ever changing value affected by the weather. However, in distribution networks the conventional approach is to operate lines with static or seasonal limits. In theory dynamic line rating allows constant monitoring of a line’s capacity. Knowing the limits of a section of the network at any moment will help to operate the network at its peak.2) Automatic Voltage Control. An AVC device monitors voltage levels and automatically adjusts them within pre set limits. In the Flexible Plug and Play project it is envisaged AVCs will be working as part of an Automatic Network Management system.3) Modern Protection Relay. The existing network uses directional over-current (DOC) protection relays which cannot handle reverse power flows. It’s said the modern protection relay will be designed to overcome this problem. It will be tested at the March and Peterborough sub stations.4) Frequent Use Switches. The distribution network in the test area uses <b>isolator</b> <b>switches</b> at Normally Open Points (NOPs) however, they are not designed for frequent use and have to be reset manually. Frequent Use Switches would be controlled remotely, allowing different network configurations to be used.5) Quadrature Booster transformer. Quad Boosters are common on transmission networks but not on distribution grids. According to the Flexible Plug and Play progress report dated June 2012 a Quad Booster could be fitted at the British Sugar factory site in Wissington. Apparently the Combined Heat & Power plant operated by British Sugar has seasonal limits on generation export due to the suboptimal loading of the three incoming 33kV circuits. The Quadrature Booster will be connected to one of the circuits to ensure load balancing and it will enable the export of additional generation from the CHP unit onto the electricity grid.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{details the}} {{development}} of an electrically-controlled, variable-stiffness spring based on magnetostrictive materials. The device, termed a magnetostrictive Varispring, can be applied as a semi-active vibration <b>isolator</b> or <b>switched</b> stiffness vibration controller for reducing transmitted vibrations. The Varispring is designed using 1 D linear models that consider the coupled electrical response, mechanically-induced magnetic diffusion, and the effect of internal mass on dynamic stiffness. Modeling results illustrate that a Terfenol-D-based Varispring has a rise time almost an order of magnitude smaller and a magnetic diffusion cut-off frequency over two orders of magnitude greater than a Galfenol-based Varispring. The results motivate the use of laminated Terfenol-D rods for a greater stiffness tuning range and increased bandwidth. The behavior of a prototype Varispring is examined under vibratory excitation up to 6 MPa and 25 Hz using a dynamic load frame. For this prototype, stiffness is indirectly varied by controlling the excitation current. Preliminary measurements of continuous stiffness tuning via sinusoidal currents up to 1 kHz are presented. The measurements demonstrate that the Young's modulus of the Terfenol-D rod inside the Varispring can be continuously varied by up to 21. 9 GPa. The observed stiffness tuning range is relatively constant up to 500 Hz, but significantly decreases thereafter. The stiffness tuning range can be greatly increased by improving the current and force control such that a more consistent current can be applied and the Varispring can be accurately tested at a more optimal bias stress...|$|R
40|$|Stimulated Brillouin {{scattering}} (SBS) {{is a very}} fundamental {{interaction between}} light and travelling acoustic waves, which is mainly attributed to the electrostriction and photoelastic effects with the interaction strength being orders of magnitude larger than other nonlinearities. Although various photonic applications for all-optical light controlling based on SBS have been achieved in optical fiber and waveguides, the coherent light-acoustic interaction remains a challenge. Here, we experimentally demonstrated the Brillouin scattering induced transparency (BSIT) in a high quality optical microresonantor. Benefited from the triple-resonance in the whispering gallery cavity, the photon-phonon interaction is enhanced, and enables the light storage to the phonon, which has lifetime up to 10 us. In addition, due to the phase matching condition, the stored circulating acoustic phonon can only interact with certain direction light, which leads to non-reciprocal light storage and retrieval.

40|$|Nonreciprocal {{photonic}} devices including optical isolators {{and optical}} circulators are indispensible components in present day optical communication systems. Although highly desired by the fast development of silicon photonics, monolithically integrating such devices on a semiconductor platform has been challenging for decades both due to material incompatibility and device designs. In this thesis, {{we focus on}} developing material and device candidates for monolithically integrated nonreciprocal photonic devices on silicon. Several magneto-optical oxide thin films including epitaxial magnetically doped perovskites and polycrystalline garnets were demonstrated with high figure of merit at communication wavelengths, while epitaxial orthoferrite films were understood to have challenges in achieving either thermodynamically limited cation ordering or kinetically limited single crystal orientations. High figure of merits of 3 ~ 4 deg/dB and 20 deg/dB were achieved in epitaxial Sr(Tio. 2 Gao.

Strong nonreciprocal phase shift (NRPS) has been demonstrated in chalcogenide glass/magnetic oxide and magnetic oxide/silicon strip-loaded waveguides by numerical simulations.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{contrast}} between the very low rate of electricity access (about 6 % of households) and the significant energy resources existing in Congo justified {{an investigation into the}} obstacles to electrification and ways to overcome them. Basically electricity is generated from hydroelectric plants; the most important located in the western tip of the country (including Inga I and Inga II) and in the copper mining area in the southeast. Only the copper mining area, the area around the capital city Kinshasa and some other towns are connected to the grid or to isolated hydro plants, leaving vast parts of the country unserved. Description and analysis of existing electricity systems, their current problems and the sector master plans led to the identification of the following major obstacles to electricity expansion: [* Poor and declining performance of the electricity sector in terms of plant availability, overall losses, non-payment, and poor collection; depriving the national utility of the necessary capacity and resources to undertake electrification. * High cost of expansion programs under the approach of extending networks by transmission and three-phase distribution lines in a vast country. Limited electricity demands in most areas, lack of standardization of voltages and network equipment, and high standards of connection equipment also contributed to increase electrification costs. ] A review of literature showed that, where already applied, the recommendation of international organisations to restructure and ultimately privatise electricity utilities has yielded limited results on the particular issue of electricity expansion towards low-load areas. As electrification of such areas is a major objective in Congo, this justifies that we do not recommend this route as a key strategy in solving the electrification problem in Congo. In other words the objective of expanding electricity throughout the country {{is not likely to be}} met by private operators that prefer large-scale electricity production for urban and industrial markets and emphasize the profitability of every project. However possible ways to improve utility's performance were identified in the literature. These include: the use of prepaid meters to improve collection, transferring the management of distribution networks in some areas to local organisations, attribution of more authority to the utility to enforce non-payment and staff training under a more experienced utility in the field. The liberalization of small-scale production that allows small operators such as missionaries, NGOs, or agro-processing industries to generate and possibly distribute electricity in remote areas may also contribute to expanding electricity in the country. The literature review also revealed that alternative MV distribution technologies and connection practices tested and successfully applied in other countries for low-cost electrification were available. Despite minor inconveniences such as their capacity restriction, and the inability to provide three-phase power for motors, single-phase technologies result in cost-effective networks as far as rural electrification is concerned. This is attractive for rural electrification in Congo. Applying single-phase MV technologies with adapted SASS and PIESA guidelines and standards to the design of an isolated rural network in eastern Congo, the following results were obtained: • When loads to be served are small (about 100 - 200 kVA) phase-phase and SWER lines are cheaper to build than three-phase lines. As loads encountered in most rural areas in Congo are generally smaller than 100 kVA and can reach 100 - 200 kVA in the medium or long run, single-phase networks can adequately supply these areas from existing networks or from local plants. • The low cost of these networks in rural areas is a result of using a reduced number of components (conductors, poles, insulators and pole-top hardware), conductors of small size and of higher ratio strength to weight (T/wc), such as ACSR, that result in long spanning lengths. • If three-phase systems were systematically used, the cost of individual connection would be higher and the capacity in the networks would have been much greater than needed. Besides, given the limited financial resources other communities could not be connected owing to the high cost of three-phase lines to connect them. In addition, in order to reach the viability of the electrification project a higher tariff should be used. This is the main finding of the financial analysis carried out to investigate the viability of the electrification project in eastern Congo. As a result of high connection costs and tariffs, electricity would become unaffordable to most rural customers. This contradicts the primary objective of providing electricity to most possible customers. In practice, as shown by the case study, the pattern of electrification should be as follows. From existing networks with sufficient capacity or from a nearby plant, an optimised three-phase line towards a main center is built. Single-phase feeders of adequate rating (taking into account present demands and future growth) derive from the backbone towards various load centers. This pattern can be applied to most rural areas in Congo. At the customer level, ready boards that include <b>isolators,</b> protection, sockets, <b>switches</b> and possibly lights are installed. The cost reduction at the network and at the customer level should result in more affordable connection costs for customers. In addition to the introduction of lower cost technologies, planning approaches should be adapted. The extent to which electricity contributes to socio economic development should be the main consideration in planning electricity expansion. In other words emphasis should be put on economic and socio economic electrification. The productive uses of electricity in economic and socio economic projects bring sustainability and may attract funding for other projects from development organisations. However some social electrification to gain political support for the economic and socio economic projects are necessary. The traditional planning policy that justifies building three-phase lines as a precaution to avoid costlier upgrading at a later stage, is not adequate when financial resources and plant capacity are limited and when uncertainty exists about load growth. In other words, three-phase networks, with capacity high enough to meet years of demand that can sometimes not grow as expected, deprive other customers of connections while capacity is idle in the existing tri-phase networks. The study has shown that there is substantial scope for the application of lower cost distribution technologies than the present standards in Congo. Applying low-cost electrification technologies such as single-phase MV distribution systems to expand electricity from existing networks and from small-scale hydro plants (as a measure to postpone the construction of more costly transmission lines), after the utility has improved its performance and skills, should significantly contribute to expand electricity in Congo. In this process, utility's efforts can be shared and complemented by small operators such as missions, NGOs, and agro-processing companies in isolated areas and at small-scale level...|$|R
