Activated carbons (AC) due to their physicochemical properties {{play a major role}} as a structural element of gas filters commonly used in respiratory protection for adsorption of many different vapors from contaminated air. It is well known that various surface function groups presented on the AC {{play a significant role in}} the hydrophobic/hydrophilic nature of them. This paper refers to the initial study of the effect of low temperature gas plasma treatment on commercially available activated carbon. To treat activated carbon by low temperature plasma, a <b>granulated</b> <b>carbon</b> was placed in a rotating test chamber. The chamber was filled with the relevant reactive gas. The effects of plasma treatment on activated carbon surface and the adsorption properties for two selected organic vapors were studied by analyzing water vapor adsorption isotherm as well as by measurement of adsorption dynamics of those vapors onto gas filter bed made of plasma treated carbons. On the basis of the obtained results it could be concluded that low temperature plasma technology may be used for improving activated carbon properties towards better adsorption of specific low temperature organic vapors.

Although these technologies {{are likely to be}} successful in degrading certain micro-organic contaminants, these may also destroy compounds which would otherwise complex and render metals significantly less toxic. This study examined the impact of enhanced tertiary treatment on the capacity of organic compounds within sewage effluents to complex copper and zinc.

High concentrations of ozone (> 1  mg O 3 /mg DOC) are, however, likely to impact the complexation capacity for copper although this is unlikely to be important at the concentrations of copper typically found in effluent discharges or in rivers. Ozone treatment did not affect zinc complexation capacity. The complexation profiles of the sewage effluents show these to contain a category of non-humic ligand that appears unaffected by tertiary treatment and which displays a high affinity for zinc, suggesting these may substantially reduce the bioavailability of zinc in effluent discharges.

The results of the experiments indicate that Calgon is more efficient than Darco in removing EDB and DBCP, that fine-grained GACs are more efficient than standard GACs, that EDB is removed more efficiently than DBCP, and that when a mixture of EDB and DBCP is passed through the same GAC, the pesticide removal efficiency of the GAC [...] based on fine-grained Calgon [...] decreases significantly. At single concentrations of EDB, no detectable concentrations (at the 10 -ppt level) were noted when the maximum flow-through GAC loading rates were 259 gal/lb•day (1. 50 ml/g•min). Based on extrapolated results, the GAC requirement for 100 ppt pesticide concentrations {{is estimated to be}} approximately 1. 0 lb/ 1. 0 mil gal...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Physico-chemical {{properties}} of effluent from a molasses fermentation based bulk drug unit were analyzed {{and found to}} be typical of the effluent from molasses fermentation except for high amount of phenols. The Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) removal capacity of tendu (Diospyros melanoxylon) leaves refuse of bidi industry and its comparison with <b>Granulated</b> Activated <b>Carbon</b> (GAC) has been presented. Batch kinetics and isotherm studies were studied under varying experimental conditions of contact time, COD concentration, adsorbent dose and pH. Maximum COD removal was observed at a narrow pH range between 7 and 8. The kinetic data were best fitted to the pseudo-second-order chemisorption model. The adsorption followed both Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. As per Langmuir model, maximum adsorption capacity {{was found to be}} 48. 54 mg and 154. 8 mg COD per g for tendu leaves refuse and GAC, respectively. The results illustrate how tendu leaves refuse, a solid waste disposal menace from bidi industry, is effective biosorbent for the removal of COD; offering a cheap option for primary treatment of the effluent...|$|R
