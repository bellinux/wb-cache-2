6000|$|LILY--[Decisively.] It's time <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> {{to rest on}} your laurels. Why can't Curt keep on {{with what}} he's doing now--stay home and write his books? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is a poor}} {{place for}} you, Michael Stein," [...] he commenced, [...] "a very poor place <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> after your own warm cottage at Echanbroignes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But so {{much depends}} upon it; {{and he is}} so stern. Of course, I wish well <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> There is plenty enough,--plenty; if only you could agree together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should there}} be a quarrel between us? I am not impatient. If you would only believe me, it would be so much more happy <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us. <b>You</b> always used to believe me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then there's no harm done," [...] {{said his}} friend, [...] "and it'll {{be a bit}} o' sport <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us. <b>You</b> go up and start, an' I'll have another pint of beer and a clean pipe waiting for you against you come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} tell her that; but I should make her understand, <b>both</b> <b>for</b> her own sake and for mine, {{that we had been}} too fast, and that the sooner we gave up our folly the better <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us. <b>You</b> can't marry her, that's the truth of it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> But you played with Will Esmond if he was at home? I will lay ten to one you played with Will Esmond." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{am afraid}} {{that if you want}} to go down into history you’ll have to do {{something}} for it. Seriously, there’s no danger whatever <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> but from overwork.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, I {{guess that}} 'll do for one while," [...] she said, {{arranging}} her tumbled hair; [...] "but there's more kisses {{where that came}} from, <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> if you want 'em. Coots!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I hope {{we shall}} have him back before Ben Soloman comes," [...] the {{charcoal}} burner said, [...] "or it will be worse <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us. <b>You</b> {{know as well as}} I do he has got my neck in a noose, and he has got his thumb on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And she has {{planned to}} tell them (by way of making it all right and {{straight}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, <b>you</b> know) that she expects her husband to join her. If I {{had been able to}} go I should have asked at the door for 'my wife.' You are going in my place--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will pardon me, {{but this}} is a very serious affair, Mr. Mannering," [...] he said. [...] "Serious <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us. Do <b>you</b> mind {{discussing}} it with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No tidings of the recreant," [...] growled Ridley, [...] "but ill tidings <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> The Dacres of Gilsland are on us, {{claiming}} your {{castle and}} lands as male heirs to your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|Max. I'll {{not hear}} you speak, her crime is plain; [...] She owns her pride, which you perhaps may feign. [...] She shall be {{prisoner}} till she bend her mind [...] To that, which is <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> designed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{are sure}} to see my son at Gibraltar, sometimes. I shall write to him, {{and tell him that}} you are there; and as your friend Sankey is on board the Brilliant, it will be {{pleasant}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, all is but begun," [...] {{she said}} in a voice that was full of hate. [...] "Know that I have heard your every word. So, traitor, you would tell my secrets to this Egyptian slut and then murder my own servants," [...] and she pointed to the dead and wounded men. [...] "Well, you shall pay <b>for</b> it, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> that I swear." ...|$|R
50|$|Seek {{spirituality and}} {{character}} first in your fiancée, which hide in themselves the eternal treasures <b>for</b> your children. <b>Both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> should be intact before marriage, because only such {{people will be}} faithful in marital chastity.|$|R
6000|$|... "He was a consenting party. Well; <b>for</b> {{the moment}} <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> keep perfect silence. Don't discuss the timing {{with each other}} lest you should be overheard: bury the thing. I am {{going to make some}} inquiries." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, yes; in one thing. But {{that one}} thing is everything. Here I've been doing the best I could <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> striving to put you upon your legs, and make you a man and her a woman, {{and this is the}} return I get!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will it not {{be better}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> Agatha, that you should {{understand}} each other? I know he loves you, though he has not told me so. You must tell him, kindly, that you cannot return his affection: you cannot always run away from him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} are happy together, and it speaks well <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> But {{we do not see}} you at church, Mr. Cawood. Your wife has often promised me to beg you to go with her; if she has done so you have surely not {{complied}} in this case." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Name the bastard. Anna Politkovskaya {{did not do}} it, so I will, <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us. <b>You</b> may {{succeed in}} {{silencing}} one man but the howl of protest {{from around the world}} will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears {{for the rest of your}} life. May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people".|$|R
6000|$|... "On the contrary," [...] he announced, [...] "it {{is coming}} to an end--with me, at any rate. Until it does come to an end, it will be kinder <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> and better <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to keep away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{might be}} better <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us if <b>you</b> were angry with me. I have to control myself; I will try again. Oh, if you only knew what I suffer when Mrs. Linley is kind to me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} near you, mother," [...] said Peregrine {{as he put}} his hand into the carriage; [...] "remember that. The judge and the other fellows will go {{out in the middle of}} the day to get a glass of wine. I'll have {{something}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> near the court." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sorry," [...] she continued; [...] "awfully sorry, old girl. It's {{a bit of}} rotten {{bad luck}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> You were just made for one another. And Fate, knowing what was coming, bustles round and gets hold of poor, silly Mrs. Phillips {{so as to be}} able to say 'Yah.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' said Hermione, listlessly now, 'I {{can only}} {{feel that it}} would be disastrous, disastrous--at least, to marry in a hurry. Can't you be {{together}} without marriage? Can't you go away and live somewhere without marriage? I do feel that marriage would be fatal, <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> I think for you even more than for him--and I think of his health--' ...|$|E
50|$|Snupps does {{allow for}} some details {{to be entirely}} private <b>for</b> <b>both</b> kind <b>of</b> users: <b>you</b> can list an item’s serial number, year made, price, warranty, among other details, and the company insists that these details will always be private.|$|R
6000|$|... 'As to that, and as to {{everything}} else of that kind, all rests with you. You will continue in all such matters to act <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, as <b>you</b> have done hitherto, and to lighten my mind of a load it is much relieved from.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless the boy!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "As though I {{were likely}} to! I {{can feel it}} go {{shivering}} down my backbone all the time. Sit here <b>for</b> a moment, <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> I am going to give Jameson orders myself not to admit any one for a little while." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Capital!" [...] said Holmes. [...] "Well, then, I should {{recommend}} a nice, cheery country walk <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you.</b> They {{tell me that}} the views from Birlstone Ridge over the Weald are very remarkable. No doubt lunch could be got at some suitable hostelry; though my ignorance of the country prevents me from recommending one. In the evening, tired but happy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know you}} can always bring Benny. There's plenty of room <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> in your bed. But now {{when you go back}} with him be careful of the lamp. I put a fresh piece of rag in and there's plenty of grease. You can blow up a coal on the hearth. I covered the fire; only be careful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We brought {{scarcely}} {{anything with}} us, because we didn't expect to need {{things in this}} way; {{but this is my}} own, and I want {{to give it to you}} both. One of you can't use it by himself, and so it will be more like a present <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> together, than most things would be." [...] And she handed me a box of dominoes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Brooke, [...] "I'll try it, {{but that}} brings us to the question, what else do you expect from me? It is very {{probable}} that I shall make an unfortunate mistake <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us, if <b>you</b> leave me in the dark. I want to understand the position." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle de Vionnet?" [...] Well, Strether easily confessed it. [...] "That, I admit, was a vain image. THIS is {{practical}} politics. I want to {{do something}} good <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> you--I wish <b>you</b> each so well; and you can see in a moment the trouble it will save me to polish you off by the same stroke. She likes you, you know. You console her. And she's splendid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is time I finished. If {{you have}} read this letter {{through to the}} end, I am sure you will excuse me if I have written it badly. There is no date to it, because I {{feel that it is}} safest and best <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> us that <b>you</b> should know nothing of where I am living. I bless you and pray for you, and bid you affectionately farewell. If <b>you</b> can think <b>of</b> me as a sister, think of me {{sometimes}} still." ...|$|R
