5|$|Immediately {{after the}} collapse, help came from mutual {{aid in the}} seven-county Minneapolis–Saint Paul {{metropolitan}} area and <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> personnel, charities, and volunteers. Within {{a few days of}} the collapse, the Minnesota Department of Transportation (Mn/DOT) planned a replacement bridge, the I-35W Saint Anthony Falls Bridge. Construction was completed rapidly, and it opened on September 18, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either {{too early in the}} season or not damaging enough to dedicate a significant portion of disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of <b>emergency</b> <b>response</b> resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E
5|$|Police {{officers}} are not armed with firearms during patrolling, but have weapons locked {{down in the}} patrol cars.

5|$|According to Ming Pao, {{family members}} of the victims were {{dissatisfied}} with the official investigation and held a sit-in protest, calling for a fair judgement.

Others blamed an ineffective firefighting system for the high death toll, and were dissatisfied that they were not given more details about the fire.|$|E
50|$|Generally, the United States Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{provides}} local {{guidance on}} implementing the National Incident Management System (NIMS) and Incident Command System (ICS) for local handling of <b>emergency</b> <b>responses.</b> As responses use up local resources, {{state and federal}} resources are mobilized under the National Response Framework, so that operational priorities are met during <b>emergency</b> <b>responses</b> of increasing size and complexity.

Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.|$|E
