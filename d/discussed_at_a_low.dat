We use Metropolis Monte Carlo simulations to study segregation effects {{at the best}} stable variant of the Σ = 5 (2 1 0) grain boundary, in the 5 - 10 at. % range of Cr composition. The role of irradiation induced vacancies in segregation is <b>discussed.</b> <b>At</b> <b>a</b> <b>low</b> Cr composition, an oscillatory Cr segregation profile is evidenced {{in the vicinity of}} the boundary. Under specific conditions, Cr ordering is observed close to the boundary. The correlations between such ordering and local stress is discussed. The binding energy of vacancies to specific sites of the grain boundary is found to be positive and the interplay between Cr segregation and the clustering of vacancies at the boundary is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier B.

These nanoparticles are found to self-assemble into spherical hollow nanospheres [56]. In addition to the kinetic effect, other factors such as the nature of the electrolyte also {{play an important role in}} generating different nanostructures.

40|$|It is {{evidenced}} by numerical calculations that optically pumped graphene is suitable for compensating inherent loss in terahertz (THz) metamaterials. In a first step, the complex conductivity of graphene under optical pumping is calculated and the proper conditions for terahertz amplification in single layer graphene are determined. It is shown that amplification in graphene occurs for temperatures up to room temperature and for moderate pump intensities when pumped <b>at</b> <b>a</b> telecommunication wavelength λ= 1. 5 μ m. Furthermore, the amplification properties of graphene are evaluated and <b>discussed</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> temperature as <b>low</b> as T= 77 K and a pump intensity I= 300 mW/mm^ 2 to investigate the coupling between graphene and a plasmonic split ring resonator (SRR) metamaterial. The contributions of ohmic and dielectric loss mechanisms are studied by full wave simulations. As a result, {{it is found that}} the loss of a split-ring resonator metamaterial can be compensated by optically stimulated amplification in graphene. Moreover, it is shown that a hybrid material consisting of asymmetric split-ring resonators and optically pumped graphene can exceed the laser threshold condition and can emit coherent THz radiation at minimum output power levels of 6 0 nW/mm^ 2. The use of optically pumped graphene is well suited for loss compensation in THz metamaterials and paves the way to new kinds of coherent THz sources. Comment: 12 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
