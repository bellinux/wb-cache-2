Deniz Aksoy presents results from an analysis of terrorist attacks in western European democracies between 1950 and 2004.

However, when comparing electoral systems, most literature has neglected this issue and emphasized and measured other dimensions: disproportionality, effective number of parties, <b>electoral</b> <b>thresholds</b> and district magnitudes. This paper argues in favor of developing an index that measure another characteristic of an electoral system: voter’s freedom to choose. It analyses the criteria that such an index should satisfy and develops one such index that meets the criteria. Finally, this index is computed to compare several electoral systems, taking also into account the other traditional indexes...|$|R

40|$|For {{statistical}} as well {{as political}} reasons combined measures of electoral dispropor-tionality and <b>electoral</b> <b>thresholds</b> are necessary in order to adequately summarize electoral institutions. With few exceptions, none of these quantities can be reliably inferred directly from the provisions of the electoral law, thus impairing “large scale ” comparative studies. Through the use of sampling based Bayes methods we are able to simultaneously estimate thresholds and disproportionality from electoral returns. We apply the proposed procedure on 45 electoral systems in use over 216 election to the national parliament in the 15 countries of the European Union in the period 1945 - 1996. The resultant two-dimensional summary of electoral systems has several advantages over measures of disproportionality currently used in comparative politics...|$|R

40|$|Three {{models are}} {{developed}} {{to analyze the}} state level conditions fostering the rise of far right parties in the European Union {{in the last two}} decades. The political background of these parties is examined. This study offers a definition for far right parties, which combines several previous attempts. The research has focused on the effects of the number of the parties, immigration, and unemployment on support for the far right in Europe. Empirical tests, using a random effects model of fifty elections in eight nations, suggest that there are political, social, and economic conditions that are conducive to electoral success. Specifically, increases in the number of "effective" parties favor the far right, while <b>electoral</b> <b>thresholds</b> serve to dampen support. Immigration proves to be a significant variable.

40|$|There is an {{assumption}} {{in much of}} the electoral engineering literature that domestic episodes of electoral system choice occur in a vacuum, isolated from international influences. Yet this assumption remains largely untested, despite the comparative focus of much of that literature. This article focuses on part of this gap by considering two electoral mechanisms that seek to limit party system fragmentation under proportional representation - low district magnitudes and high <b>electoral</b> <b>thresholds</b> - and shows that the mechanisms have spread across many European countries during the post- 1945 period. Analyses reveal that national legislators are more likely to adopt one of these electoral mechanisms when a large number of peer countries have made similar choices within {{the last two or three}} years. This effect is robust to various model specifications and to the inclusion of multiple controls. The article also offers some qualitative evidence from case studies and parliamentary debates.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>electoral</b> <b>thresholds</b> of the {{fundamental}} electoral formulae, in particular, six proportional techniques and four plurality systems are analyzed. First, the general formulae for the theoretical thresholds are derived at both the district and nationwide levels. Second, the thesis focuses on Actual Thresholds, mainly {{on the question of}} their operational definition and academic relevance. Both the theoretical parts of the thesis concerned with the theoretical and actual thresholds are supported with an analysis of particular electoral systems. In the case of the theoretical threshold the analysed systems are those, which currently applies for the upper house of Parliament and for the municipal elections of the Czech Republic. The third analysed case is the electoral system used for the municipal elections of the Slovak Republic. In the case of empirical thresholds, the final chapter seeks to compare current and original electoral systems for the lower house of the Parliament of the Czech Republic.

The hypothesis is as follows: assembly size has a negative effect on the degree of dispro-portionality and a positive effect on the effective number of parties in systems with single-member dis-tricts—in proportional electoral systems, by contrast, such a pattern does not exist. In PR systems, notably the average effective threshold supersedes assembly size in explaining the degree of disproportionality and the effective number of parties. <b>Electoral</b> <b>thresholds,</b> ordinal ballots and apparentement, which also have some impact on disproportionality and party system fragmentation in proportional elections, are ab-sent in systems with single-member districts (with the exception of ordinal ballots in alternative vote sys-tems).

Highest average formulas include: D'Hondt, St. Laguë, modified St. Laguë, Hungarian St. Laguë, Danish method, Imperiali's divisors, Huntington method and Adams method. Largest remainder formulas include Hare, Hagenbach-Bischoff, Droop, Imperiali, and reinforced Imperiali quotas.
