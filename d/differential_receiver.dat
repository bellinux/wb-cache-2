40|$|Radiometeric CMB {{measurements}} need to {{be highly}} stable and this stability is best obtained with <b>differential</b> <b>receivers.</b> The residual 1 /f noise in the differential output {{is strongly dependent on}} the radiometer input offset which can be cancelled using various balancing strategies. In this paper we discuss a software method implemented in the Planck-LFI pseudo-correlation receivers which uses a tunable "gain modulation factor, r, in the sky-load difference. Numerical simulations and experimental data show how proper tuning of the parameter r ensures a very stable differential output with knee frequencies of the order of few mHz. Various approaches to calculate r using the radiometer total power data are discussed with some examples relevant to Planck-LFI. Although the paper focuses on pseudo-correlation receivers and the examples are relative to Planck-LFI, the proposed method and its analysis is general and can be applied to a large class of <b>differential</b> radiometric <b>receivers.</b> Comment: 12 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in A&A (updated version with few editorial changes...|$|R

50|$|A {{balanced}} line allows a <b>differential</b> <b>receiver</b> {{to reduce the}} noise on a connection by rejecting common-mode interference. The lines have the same impedance to ground, so the interfering fields or currents induce the same voltage in both wires. Since the receiver responds only {{to the difference between}} the wires, it is not influenced by the induced noise voltage. If {{balanced line}} is used in an unbalanced circuit, with different impedances from each conductor to ground, currents induced in the separate conductors will cause different voltage drops to ground, thus creating a voltage differential, making the line more susceptible to noise. Examples of twisted pairs include category 5 cable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{demonstrate}} a modulator-based chip-to-chip link operation {{with an array}} of <b>differential</b> integrating <b>receivers</b> with a very low total optical power penalty of 0. 12 dB for 100 mV of supply noise in receivers. Parallel operation of large two dimensional optical I/Os can provide the throughput needed in electronic applications. These I/Os need to be placed close to digital circuits to minimize the latency. Simultaneous operation of this large array along with the operation of nearby digital circuits generates noise on the supply in the form of switching noise. The magnitude of this noise can be 100 s of mV. Noise on the chip is also generated by carrier injection into the substrate. We demonstrate the operation of a link with high immunity to supply and substrate noise. A total link power penalty of only 0. 12 dB/ 100 mV of receiver supply noise was observed. Link performance was unaffected by substrate noise injection from a voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). This high immunity {{can be attributed to the}} differential nature of the receiver. The effect of supply noise and crosstalk on electrically singleended receivers has been studied [1] [2].

40|$|Effect {{of forest}} canopy on the {{accuracy}} of a {{differential global positioning system}} (dGPS). The possibilities to use dGPS (differential global positioning system) for forest mapping are analyzed. The efficiency of dGPS in forest condition is linked to canopy interference, which intercepts signals sent by some of the satellites or reflect them (multipathing). Two types of equipment have been tested: a Trimble Svee Six coupled with a RDS <b>differential</b> <b>receiver</b> and a Trimble SK 8 coupled with an OMNISTAR <b>differential</b> <b>receiver.</b> Recordings have been achieved according to two modes: static (recording on one spot during one minute) and cinematic (moving continuously along the stand limits). Two types of forest canopy were compared: light canopy made of young poplar plantation with few obstacles in the vicinity, and closed canopy of mature spruce stand edged with other mature stand. Cinematic mode efficiency is higher than static one (mean errors are respectively 3. 1 m and 9. 1 m). In the same way positioning is more accurate for the stand with light canopy than for the other one (mean errors are respectively 2. 9 m and 9. 4 m). Difference between recording modes are probably due to multipathing effect that filtering algorithm integrated in the GPS receivers are not able to remove in static mode. The efficiency of differential signal reception is also different for the two stands: 1. 3 / and 20. 5 / of missing differential signal respectively in the light and dense canopy conditions...|$|E
