In addition, without indication of causality, the husband’s share in paying bills was negatively associated with the household easily making ends meet, the husband spending freely, and frequent debate about money.

40|$|Having {{worked in}} the Employees and Commercial Payments Branch of the <b>Financial</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Division</b> for the past 3 summers, I have seen the many changes that have {{occurred}} within the NASA organization. As I return each summer, I find that new programs and systems have been adapted to better serve the needs of the Center and of the Agency. The NASA Agency has transformed itself the past couple years with the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program (IFMP). IFMP is designed to allow the Agency to improve its management of its Financial, Physical, and Human Resources through the use of multiple enterprise module applications. With my mentor, Joseph Kan, being the branch chief of the Employees and Commercial Payments Branch, I have been exposed to several modules, such as Travel Manager, WebTads, and Core Financial/SAP, which were implemented {{in the last couple of}} years under the IFMP. The implementation of these agency-wide systems has sometimes proven to be troublesome. Prior to IFMP, each NASA Center utilizes their own systems for Payroll, Travel, Accounts Payable, etc. But with the implementation of the Integrated Financial Management Program, all the "legacy" systems had to be eliminated. As a result, a great deal of enhancement and preparation work is necessary to ease the transformation from the old systems to the new. All this work occurs simultaneously; for example, e-Payroll will "go live" in several months, but a system like Travel Manager will need to have information upgraded within the system to meet the requirements set by Headquarters. My assignments this summer have given me the opportunity to become involved with such work. So far, I have been given the opportunity to participate in projects resulting from a congressional request, several bankcard reconciliations, updating routing lists for Travel Manager, updating the majordomo list for Travel Manager approvers and point of contacts, and a NASA Headquarters project involving improper payments on firm fixed price contracts. Each of the projects that I have worked on this summer presents a different aspect of the work performed on a regular basis by members of this branch. Not only do I get to see the "big picture" of what occurs within the organization, but I also get to experience the "little stuff" that goes on here and throughout the NASA Agency...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the extent to which small to medium-sized building contractors beneficially utilise the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> function in their enterprises to improve and ensure business sustainability. <b>Financial</b> <b>management</b> focuses on the principles of decision-making, which requires action, without perfect knowledge of the outcome. To effectively execute the financial function, using the primary inputs in decision-making, <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> requires the ability to: understand and interpret financial statements and reports; make reasoned and objective decisions in controlling the operations of the enterprise; have a thorough knowledge of the internal functioning of the enterprise; and have a thorough knowledge of current and expected future economic conditions in the external environment. To do this, requires an effectively applied <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> function in the enterprises, which includes the utilisation of the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> criteria to ensure business sustainability. However, without an appreciation of what <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> is, how important <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> is, and how <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> must be applied in the enterprise, small to medium-sized building contractors will find it difficult to effectively perform the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> function and its different activities.

Consequently, a survey was carried out amongst small to medium-sized building contractors in the Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipal (NMMM) area, which revealed information that was used to come to certain conclusions: Firstly, it can be concluded that the <b>financial</b> <b>management</b> function is generally exercised superficially.
