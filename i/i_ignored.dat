2500|$|Page was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} soundtrack music for the film Lucifer Rising by Crowley admirer and underground movie director Kenneth Anger. Page ultimately produced 23 minutes of music, which Anger felt was insufficient because the film ran for 28 minutes and Anger wanted the film {{to have a full}} soundtrack. Anger claimed Page took three years to deliver the music and the final product was only 23 minutes of [...] "droning". The director also slammed the guitarist in the press by calling him a [...] "dabbler" [...] in the occult and an addict and being too strung out on drugs to complete the project. Page countered that he had fulfilled all his obligations, even {{going so far as to}} lend Anger his own film editing equipment to help him finish the project. Page released the Lucifer Rising music on vinyl in 2012 via his website on [...] "Lucifer Rising and other sound tracks". Side one contained [...] "Lucifer Rising – Main Track", whilst side two contained the tracks [...] "Incubus", [...] "Damask", [...] "Unharmonics", [...] "Damask – Ambient", and [...] "Lucifer Rising [...] – Percussive Return". In the December 2012 Rolling Stone cover story [...] "Jimmy Page Looks Back", Page said: [...] "...there was a request, suggesting that Lucifer Rising should come out again with my music on. <b>I</b> <b>ignored</b> it." ...|$|E

[...] While working on the album, Gomez enlisted frequent collaborators Rock Mafia to help make her sound a reality. They helped Gomez on the creation of six tracks on the album, including [...] "Revival" [...] and [...] "Kill Em with Kindness", the latter being one of the most personal tracks on Revival. She told the producers that although the production was important, she wanted the focus of the song to be the lyrics.|$|R

60|$|There {{are those}} who would say that I dealt unfairly last Sunday by the Psalms of David; {{that in order to}} prove them inspired, <b>I</b> <b>ignored</b> an element in them which is plainly uninspired, wrong, and offensive; namely, the curses which he invokes upon his enemies. <b>I</b> <b>ignored</b> it, they would say, because it was fatal to my theory! because it proved David to have the vindictive passions of other Easterns; to be speaking, not by the {{inspiration}} of God, but of his own private likes and dislikes; to be at least a fanatic who thinks that his cause must needs be God's cause, and who invokes the lightnings of heaven on all who dare to differ from him. Others would say that such words were excusable in David, living under the Old Law; for it was said by them of old time, 'Thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy:' but that our Lord has formally abrogated that permission; 'But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, and do good to those who despitefully use you and persecute you.' How unnecessary, and how wrong then, they would say, it is of the Church of England to retain these cursing Psalms in her public worship, and put them into the mouths of her congregations. Either they are merely painful, as well as unnecessary to Christians; or if they mean anything, they excuse and foster the habit too common among religious controversialists of invoking the wrath of heaven on their opponents.|$|E

60|$|The {{absence of}} a {{criterion}} to distinguish between races and sub-races, and our ethnological ignorance generally, {{makes it impossible to}} offer more than a very off-hand estimate of the average variety of races in the different countries of the world. I have, however, endeavoured to form one, which I give with much hesitation, knowing how very little it is worth. I registered the usually recognised races inhabiting each of upwards of twenty countries, and who at the same time formed at least half per cent of the population. It was, I am perfectly aware, a very rough proceeding, so rough that for the United Kingdom <b>I</b> <b>ignored</b> the prehistoric types and accepted only the three headings of British, Low Dutch, and Norman-French. Again, as regards India I registered as follows:--Forest tribes (numerous), Dravidian (three principal divisions), Early Arian, Tartar (numerous, including Afghans), Arab, and lastly European, on account of their political importance, notwithstanding the fewness of their numbers. Proceeding in this off-hand way, and after considering the results, the broad conclusion to which I arrived was that on the average at least three different recognised races were to be found in every moderately-sized district on the earth's surface. The materials were far too scanty to enable any idea to be formed of the rate of change in the relative numbers of the constituent races in each country, and still less to estimate the secular changes of type in those races.|$|E
