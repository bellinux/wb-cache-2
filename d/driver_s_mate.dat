It presents a consequentialist challenge to recent virtue ethics, but its positive views and especially its interesting examples have great significance in their own right. <b>Driver</b> <b>s</b> defence of virtues of ignorance has force despite all the challenges to it that have been mounted over the years. But there are also examples differing from those Driver has mentioned that favour the idea of such virtues. Perhaps certain virtues of religious faith and the virtue necessary for dealing as best one can with moral dilemmas both require ignorance. However, some of the examples Driver does discuss raise the question whether virtue status is based solely on consequences, rather than perhaps having (in addition) a motivational component. ...|$|R

40|$|As a {{socially}} monogamous species, humans generally have one committed romantic partner at a time, but sometimes engage in infidelity. Previous research has related infidelity to individual difference traits, including global assessments of “mate value” (relative {{value as a}} romantic partner on the “mating market”). We explored {{the extent to which}} one 2 ̆ 7 s intention to commit an infidelity is uniquely predicted by different components of mate value. The results confirm a negative relationship between one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> overall <b>mate</b> value and one 2 ̆ 7 s intention to commit an infidelity, and also identify four distinct mate value components (agreeableness/commitment, surgency, emotional stability, and physical attractiveness) that uniquely predict infidelity intention. Two of these factors, surgency (for women) and agreeableness/commitment (for men), positively predict anticipated infidelity. Additionally, the results indicate that men 2 ̆ 7 s but not women 2 ̆ 7 s infidelity intention is better predicted by the combination of their own and their partner 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>mate</b> value.

We compare aspects of female and male reproductive biology between island populations of the butterfly Hypolimnas bolina that show varying degrees of female bias, because of a male-killing Wolbachia infection. Contrary to expectation, female bias leads {{to an increase in}} female mating frequency, up to a point where male mating capacity becomes limiting. We show that increased female mating frequency can be explained as a facultative response to the depleted male mating resources in female biased populations.
