40|$|Real {{behaviour}} {{and general}} {{load carrying capacity}} of timber structures mostly depends on the load bearing capacity of joints. Among the effective types of modern structures are constructions with joints with connections {{on the basis of}} metal <b>plates</b> <b>slotted</b> into timber profiles. The paper deals with steel to timber joints <b>with</b> <b>slotted</b> <b>plates.</b> Non-traditional measuring method was using at measuring strength of structure metal-wood-metal too. One of them was acoustic emission method, which belongs to a group non-destructive testing method. This method, in contrast to other ones, records only active defects into followed structure. Therefore its application in this test can be great acquisition especially in areas of development connections. According to expectation a critical part was the connection metal-wood. Note that the acoustic emission method reflected defect rise in structure much sooner than followed by eye, or which it is possible immediately determine by other used methods. Time-frequency analysis plays a central role in signal analysis.

40|$|Abstract: Connections are key {{elements}} and the weak points for timber structures. The {{most commonly used}} bolted timber connections <b>with</b> <b>slotted</b> in steel <b>plate</b> have low lateral stiffness in post-and-beam construction. This paper introduces the prestressed-tube bolted connection to alleviate this problem. To evaluate its lateral resisting performance, the failure mode, strength, lateral stiffness, ductility, hysteresis curve and equivalent viscous damping ratio of the ordinary and improved connections, {{as determined by the}} monotonic and reversed cyclic loading test, are compared. The results demonstrate that the lateral stiffness of the prestressed-tube bolted connection has been significantly improved, especially for initial stiffness. It is believed that the semi-rigid prestressed-tube bolted connection, as an alternative to current bolted solutions, may provide reasonable lateral stiffness and has good potential for use in post-and-beam timber construction...|$|R
40|$|The <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> {{flow meter}} {{has been widely}} tested as an {{obstruction}} flow meter {{during the past several}} years. It has been tested for both single-phase flows as well as for two-phase flows. Previous studies have revealed that the <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> flow meter is always better in performance and accuracy than the standard orifice plate flow meter. This study is primarily based on how a <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> responds to horizontal two-phase flow with air and water being used as the working fluids. The plates under consideration are those with beta ratios of 0. 43 and 0. 467. Experiments have been performed with six different configurations of the <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> test sections. The performances of the <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> flow meters will be compared to that of a standard orifice plate flow meter and then with a venturi. The effects of varying the upstream quality of the two-phase flow on the differential pressure and the coefficient of discharge of the <b>slotted</b> <b>plates,</b> the standard orifice plate and the venturi will be evaluated. Response characteristics at low differential pressures will be investigated. Tests for repeatability will be performed by studying the effects of the gas Reynolds number and the upstream quality on the differential pressure. The differential pressures across the <b>slotted</b> <b>plates,</b> the standard orifice plate and the venturi will be compared. Reproducibility will be evaluated by comparing the data obtained from all six different configurations.

50|$|The {{faceplate}} was the {{ancestor of}} lathe chucks, {{an arrangement of}} three or more adjustable 'dogs' bolted to the faceplate providing a primitive chuck arrangement. The smaller plate in the upper photo is specifically a 'dog face' <b>with</b> <b>slots</b> intended to hold a bent tail dog while the work itself was supported on centers. The larger plate to the right simply provides {{a variety of ways}} by which work can be bolted or clamped to the <b>plate.</b> The <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> on the lower photo accepts wedged holders which can be used to fasten the work to the plate. The plates were expendibles, so it was not unusual as shown in both photos for a machinist to drill additional holes in the plates for attaching work that could not otherwise be attached. While the Dog plates were usually fairly small regardless of the lathe size, the classic face plate is usually matched to the maximum diameter that the lathe will swing.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the fire performance of bolted tensile connections in laminated veneer lumber (LVL) made from radiata pine. The capacity of the bolted connections depends on the embedding strength of the wood and on the yield moment of the bolts. The purpose of the research was to investigate the relationship between the failure load of LVL timber and the time to failure of the connections when exposed to fire. An experimental investigation was carried out on the axial tensile strength of three types of bolted connection that utilised either wood or steel splice plates. Some specimens were tested at ambient temperature while similar specimens were tested in fire conditions with a constant applied load. In addition, single-bolted connections were tested under constant elevated temperature conditions to determine the embedment strength of the LVL. Connections with no steel plates, or <b>with</b> steel <b>plates</b> <b>slotted</b> between the timber members performed better than those with exposed steel. A simplified design approach based on an extension to the Johansen formulae such that the embedment strength of the LVL depends upon the temperature in the bolt has been proposed for the fire resistance of connections. ...|$|R

The standard orifice plate is used extensively by the natural gas industry for the metering of fuel. Because of the costs associated with errors in flow measurement inherent {{with the use of a}} standard orifice plate, any improvements upon the existing standard orifice plate design would be desirable. Consequently, a new type of orifice plate has been designed. It is termed the "slotted orifice plate". In the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate,</b> the familiar round hole found in the center of standard orifice plates is replaced with a circular array of radially aligned slots. The objective of this project was to compare the performance of the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> to that of the standard orifice plate in order to determine the extent, if any, to which the <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plate</b> is superior to the standard orifice plate in flow measurement. This was done by investigating pipe-wall pressure distributions and velocity profiles associated with flow through both the standard <b>plate</b> and the <b>slotted</b> <b>plate</b> for a variety of test cases. By using the pressure distribution and velocity profile data, coefficients of discharge were plotted against the second order radial moments of axial momentum.

40|$|International audienceIt {{has been}} shown in our {{previous}} publications that the addition of power-law profiled wedges to edges of rectangular plates or strips results in substantial increase in damping of resonant flexural vibrations in plates or strips due to the acoustic black hole effect associated with power-law wedges.

Tests for repeatability will be shown for beta ratios of 0. 430, 0. 467, and 0. 500. Reproducibility will also be evaluated between a water and steam facility and three water and air facilities. This includes comparing data obtained using a set of brass <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plates</b> and a set of stainless steel <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plates.</b> The brass plates were tested in one water and air facility in a previous study and the stainless steel plates were tested using two phase data from air and water and also from steam and water.

Reproducibility from six different data sets found using different facilities, different <b>slotted</b> orifice <b>plates,</b> and different working fluids were shown to converge to the same relationship. This relationship contained non-dimensional variables which included the calibration coefficient (KY= flow coefficient (K) multiplied by the expansion factor (Y)), the Euler number, and the beta ratio.
