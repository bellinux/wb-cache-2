40|$|In the {{standard}} model of cosmology, the universe is currently dominated by dark {{energy in the form}} of the cosmological constant that drives the expansion to accelerate. While the cosmological constant hypothesis is consistent with all current data, models with dynamical behaviour of dark energy are still allowed by observations. Uncertainty also remains over whether the underlying assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic universe is valid, or if large-scale inhomogeneities in the matter distribution can be the cause of the apparent late-time acceleration. This thesis investigates inhomogeneous cosmological models in which dark energy clusters or where we live inside an underdense region in a matter-dominated universe. In both of these scenarios, we expect <b>directional</b> <b>dependences</b> in the redshift-luminosity distance relation of type Ia supernovae. Dynamical models of dark energy predict spatial variations in the dark energy density. Searches for angular correlated fluctuations in the supernova peak magnitudes, as expected if dark energy clusters, yield results consistent with no dark energy fluctuations. However, the current observational limits on the amount of correlation still allow for quite general dark energy clustering occurring in the linear regime. Inhomogeneous models where we live inside a large, local void in the matter density can possibly explain the apparent acceleration without invoking dark energy. This scenario is confronted with current cosmological distance measurements to put constraints on the size and depth of the void, as well as on our position within it. The model is found to explain the observations only if the void size is of the order of the visible universe and the observer is located very close to the center, in violation of the Copernican principle.

The combined use of aerosol, VOC, main gaseous pollutants composition data and wind data resulted in better values of statistical indicators and diagnostic plots, and source factors which could be more easily related to known sources. The number of source factors resolved was similar to those {{reported in the literature}} where larger data sets were used. Three source factors were identified for the coarse particle samples, including ‘crustal matter’, ‘vehicle emissions’ and ‘sea spray’. Seven source factors were identified for the fine particle and VOC samples, including ‘secondary and biogenic’, ‘petroleum refining’, ‘vehicle emissions’, ‘petroleum product wholesaling’, ‘evaporative emissions’, ‘sea spray’ and ‘crustal matter’. The factor loadings of the 16 wind sectors and the calm wind sector from the PMF analysis were also used to quantify the directional contribution of the source factors. While the contributions were higher in the prevailing wind directions as expected, calm winds were also found to contribute up to 17 % of the pollutant mass on average. The factor loadings, normalised by the overall abundance of the wind sectors, were also used to assess the <b>directional</b> <b>dependences</b> of the source factors. The results matched well with the location of known sources in the area. There was also a higher contribution potential from calm winds for local sources compared to that for distant sources.
