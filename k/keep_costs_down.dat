Tupper's old friend Sandford Fleming oversaw the railway construction, but his inability to <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> led to political controversy, and Tupper was forced to remove Fleming as Chief Engineer in May 1880.|$|E

25|$|Led by Masayuki Uemura, Nintendo's R {{team had}} been {{secretly}} {{working on a}} system since 1980, ambitiously targeted to be less expensive than its competitors, yet with performance {{that could not be}} surpassed by its competitors for at least a year. Uemura initially thought of using a modern 16-bit CPU, but instead settled on the inexpensive MOS Technology 6502, supplementing it with a custom graphics chip (the Picture Processing Unit). To <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down,</b> suggestions of including a keyboard, modem, and floppy disk drive were rejected, but expensive circuitry was added to provide a versatile 15-pin expansion port connection {{on the front of the}} console for future add-on functionality such as peripheral devices.|$|E
25|$|The band {{decided to}} record its next album {{without the help}} of a label, {{supporting}} itself with touring and by compiling its previously released singles into Singles, which was released on indie label Big Wheel Recreation.

The band worked for a third time with Trombino, who agreed to defer payment until after the album's release in order to <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down.</b> Some of the drum tracks were recorded at Cherokee, and then the band moved to Doug Messenger's harddrive analog and digital in North Hollywood, where five weeks of tracking completed the recording phase. Trombino then mixed the record at Extasy in Hollywood.|$|E
25|$|With {{the growth}} of the size of {{development}} teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. Development studios {{need to be able to}} pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down</b> in order to maintain profitability on their investment. Typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. In May 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450. The growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.|$|E

25|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes {{as part of}} the {{concession}} agreements, and Braathens SAFE was losing money on the Haugesund‚ÄìBergen route and flights to R√∏ros. A three-year wage agreement was reached with the trade unions to <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down,</b> and the company raised additional capital in an initial public offering and subsequent listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange on 10 January 1994. After the listing, Braganza retained 69% of the company. On 1 April, service frequencies increased on the Oslo‚ÄìBergen route and the airline introduced direct flights from Oslo to Troms√∏ and Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes, later supplemented with direct services to Bod√∏. The following two years, Braathens SAFE also introduced scheduled international flights to Rome, as well as summer routes to Jersey and Nice. However, Braathens SAFE terminated their routes from Bergen to Bod√∏, Harstad/Narvik and Troms√∏, making the passengers switch planes in Trondheim. Braathens signed agreements with many of Norway's large companies in 1995 in exchange for large discounts.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the film}} was {{rejected}} by every major studio in Hollywood, mostly due to the $20 million budget and the deal Lucas was offering.

Special effects were done using puppets, miniature models, animation, and camera trickery. [...] "We didn't do 30 or 40 takes; usually only four. It was like silent film--shoot only what you need, no waste", Spielberg said. [...] "Had I had more time and money, it would have turned out a pretentious movie." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{a cheaper}} option the UX32A was praised by Chris Martin of PC Advisor for being [...] "a more {{affordable}} luxury", retaining the [...] "premium feel" [...] of the Zenbook range {{but at a}} lower price point. The aluminium chassis, which is identical to the UX32VD to <b>keep</b> <b>costs</b> <b>down,</b> was widely acclaimed for its strength and build quality. By contrast, the Sandy Bridge chip, a previous-generation part at the time of sale, was outlined as a detraction as was the lower battery life compared to the UX31E. Although the screen used was a TN panel and of a lower resolution than the UX32VD or UX31A, it was considered an acceptable compromise for the price. The screen has a matte finish and relatively high brightness which Notebook Check's reviewer, Christian Hepp, found [...] "quite suitable for outdoor use", noting that it had a good contrast ratio but a narrow range of colours.|$|E
