5|$|Athletes will {{sometimes}} become citizens {{of a different}} nation so {{they are able to}} compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>places</b> as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E
5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, Letters proved equally popular. Dutch and German translations were rapidly produced, {{and prompted}} by constant demand, editions appeared <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>places</b> as Dublin, Paris and Maastricht. In {{lieu of a}} second volume of letters, Crèvecœur produced an expanded French version (Lettres d'un cultivateur américain) that was published in 1784. The French version, which removed the fictional persona of James, {{is presented as a}} series of documents that have been neutrally edited, providing greater documentary detail but at the expense of artistry.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of Pierre Riché, the {{disappearance}} of 220 bishops' seats indicates that the Lombard migration was a crippling catastrophe for the Church. Yet according to Walter Pohl the regions directly occupied by Alboin suffered less devastation and had a relatively robust survival rate for towns, whereas the occupation of territory by autonomous military bands interested mainly in raiding and looting had a more severe impact, with the bishoprics <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>places</b> rarely surviving.|$|E

5000|$|Whereas {{the modern}} saut means simply [...] "(a) jump", sault in the 17th century was also applied to cataracts, waterfalls and rapids. This {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>place</b> names as Grand Falls/Grand-Sault, and Sault-au-Récollet on the Island of Montreal in Canada; and Sault-Saint-Remy and Sault-Brénaz in France.

5|$|The Cape sparrow is social, {{lives in}} flocks, and usually breeds in colonies. Away from settled areas it {{spends much of}} the year {{wandering}} nomadically, in flocks of up to 200 birds. In cultivated and built up areas, smaller flocks form where food is provided for livestock or birds. <b>In</b> <b>such</b> <b>places,</b> it associates with other seed-eating birds, such as the house sparrow, the Cape weaver, and weavers of the genus Euplectes. Birds from urban areas form large flocks seasonally and fly out to the nearby countryside to feed on ripening grain, returning at night to roost.|$|E
5|$|According to Robert van Voren, {{although}} for several years, {{especially after the}} implosion of the USSR and during {{the first years of}} Boris Yeltsin's rule, the positions of the Soviet psychiatric leaders were in jeopardy, now one can firmly conclude that they succeeded in riding out the storm and retaining their powerful positions. They also succeeded in avoiding an inflow of modern concepts of delivering mental health care and a fundamental change in the structure of psychiatric services in Russia. On the whole, in Russia, the impact of mental health reformers has been the least. Even the reform efforts made <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>places</b> as St. Petersburg, Tomsk, and Kaliningrad have faltered or were encapsulated as centrist policies under Putin brought them back under control.|$|E
5|$|B.spinulosa var.spinulosa: The {{nominate}} race is an autonym, a {{name that}} was automatically created for the original material of the species as the other subspecies were described. The original hairpin banksia, this plant is coastal in Queensland, seen <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>places</b> as Walshs Pyramid (near Cairns), Byfield National Park and the Blackdown Tableland, then again in New South Wales south of the Hawkesbury River, just north of Sydney, down the New South Wales South Coast and into Victoria. Northwards of the Hawkesbury River on Sydney's northern outskirts there is a gradation between this and B.spinulosa var.collina. It commonly has black, maroon or claret styles on gold spikes but all-gold inflorescences are seen, and leaves are generally narrower than other varieties at 1–2mm in width and have several serrations toward the apex only.|$|E

From the 16th century on, it became possible for settlements with significant springs to get the title městys.

5|$|Western cicada killers {{are found}} at a higher {{altitude}} than most other Sphecius species and are sympatric with the species S.convallis and S.speciosus, even though S.grandis are on average found at higher altitudes than S.convallis. A study showed that the mean elevation for S.grandis was 755m ± 23.3m, compared with the lower results of S.speciosus (219m ± 4.7m), S.convallis (582m ± 30.9m) and S.hogardii (18m ± 5m). The species is Nearctic and Neotropic, found from Central America to the Western United States, in New Mexico, California and every state west of the Rocky Mountains, except Wyoming, as well as Kansas, Oklahoma and Nebraska. S.grandis is most commonly found in riparian zones. It has been observed <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>places</b> in Mexico as Baja California Norte, Baja California Sur, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, Tamaulipas and Yucatán and also in Granada (Nicaragua), Guanacaste (Costa Rica) and Honduras.|$|E
5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of pollutants found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of pollutants in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of pollutants in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment <b>in</b> <b>such</b> <b>places</b> as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E
