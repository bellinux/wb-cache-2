On 1 November 1876, the township was inaugurated at a luncheon given by Captain T. A. Lake on board the <b>Government</b> <b>ship,</b> SS Victoria. This is regarded as the official birth date of Cairns. The first public land sales in February 1877 were supplemented, three months later, by the construction of the first local saw mill making use of the abundant natural timber resources.|$|E
500|$|Following the Jacobite {{defeat a}} <b>Government</b> <b>ship</b> sailed up Loch Fyne and shelled Castle Lachlan, forcing the chief's family {{to abandon their}} residence, and in Edinburgh the Maclachlan colours were burned on the orders of the Duke of Cumberland. It had been assumed that the chiefs lands had been {{forfeited}} for his support of the Young Pretender and the Jacobite cause, but it was ruled {{that he had been}} killed before he could be attainted. The chief of the Campbells, the Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, who although helped crush the Jacobite forces, aided Donald, son of the deceased Maclachlan chief, and helped save his lands. On 12 February 1747 Donald Maclachlan of that Ilk received a charter for his lands [...] "at the intercession of the Duke of Argyll", though it was considerably unpopular decision at the time, and Maclachlan's estates were [...] "surveyed but afterwards found not to be forfeited".|$|E
500|$|On a {{traditional}} view, {{after the death}} of the cautious LÃ³pez I, his son paid not enough attention to his father's dying words: to try to settle disputes with Brazil with the pen not the sword. [...] He was induced by the then Uruguayan government to intervene in the Uruguayan War, [...] which he did on 13 November 1864 by firing across the bows of, then seizing, the Brazilian <b>government</b> <b>ship</b> the [...] Marques de Olinda as she was proceeding upriver on her monthly voyage to the Mato Grosso; he proceeded to seize the Mato Grosso itself. [...] According to the American ambassador to Paraguay Charles A. Washburn, Lopez explained his seizure of the Brazilian ship by saying [...] "with more candor than discretion" [...] that only by a war could the attention and respect of the world be secured to Paraguay; that although Paraguay was a small power in comparison with Brazil, she had [...] "advantages of position" [...] that gave her an equality of strength; and that the Paraguayan troops would be already [...] "fortified and intrenched" [...] before the Brazilians could arrive in any considerable numbers.|$|E

500|$|On {{the evening}} of 18 June the British steamer Arakaka had spotted a small ship a few miles outside Georgetown, and radioed this {{information}} to the shore. An unarmed police launch left Georgetown to investigate; as they approached, {{the crew of the}} as yet unidentified vessel became hostile. They denied that she was Girl Pat and threatened violence should officers attempt to board her. The launch retreated to Georgetown, where the police armed themselves and obtained authority [...] to seize the suspect vessel. They returned early the following morning to find that their quarry was departing. A two-hour chase ensued, which The Hull Daily Mail glamorised as a sporting contest: [...] "Like some coursing greyhound the faster <b>Government</b> <b>ship</b> stuck to the tail of the fleeing suspect which, harelike, doubled back on her course to dodge her pursuer". According to the British Daily Worker, the chase [...] " [...] the most spectacular efforts of film directors". Finally, while manoeuvring at close quarters, the vessels collided. The stern of the suspect boat was severely damaged, whereupon she surrendered and was taken in tow. The name displayed on the vessel's hull was [...] "Kia-ora", but Stephens quickly admitted to their captors that the ship was Girl Pat.|$|E

During the last two decades of the 19th century, Captain Healy was essentially the federal government's law enforcement presence in the vast Alaska Territory.

2500|$|During 1854-1864 Paraguay, {{considering}} {{itself to}} be disrespected by the outside world particularly Brazil, Argentina, the United States and the British Empire, built up its military forces. [...] In 1864, the Blanco faction of the Uruguayan War (against Brazil), short of allies, tried to lure Paraguay to its side. [...] In November 1864 Paraguay fired upon and seized the Brazilian <b>government</b> <b>ship</b> MarquÃ©s de Olinda as it was proceeding up the Paraguay on its routine monthly voyage to the Mato Grosso. [...] (It proved to be carrying military stores). [...] On 14 January 1865 the Paraguayan government asked Argentina for permission to attack Brazil across the Province of Corrientes, which was refused. [...] On 13 April Paraguayan ships fired upon, and seized, two Argentine naval vessels moored in the Argentine port of Corrientes and the Paraguayans proceeded to invade the province of that name.|$|E
2500|$|Negative {{perceptions}} of Butler were compounded by his questionable financial dealings {{in several of}} his commands, {{as well as the}} activities of his brother Andrew, who acted as Butler's financial proxy and was given [...] "almost free rein" [...] to engage in exploitative business deals and other [...] "questionable activities" [...] in New Orleans. Upon arriving in the city, Butler immediately began attempts to participate in the lucrative inter-belligerent trade. He used a Federal warship to send $60,000 in sugar to Boston where he expected to sell it for $160,000. However, his use of the <b>government</b> <b>ship</b> was reported to the military authorities, and Butler was chastised. Instead of earning a profit, military authorities permitted him to recover only his $60,000 plus expenses. Thereafter, his brother Andrew officially represented the family in such activities. Everyone in New Orleans believed that Andrew accumulated a profit of $1â$2 million while in Louisiana. Upon inquiry from Treasury Secretary Chase in October 1862, the general responded that his brother actually cleared less than $200,000. When Butler was replaced in New Orleans by Major General Nathaniel Banks, Andrew Butler unsuccessfully tried to bribe Banks with $100,000 if Banks would permit Andrew's [...] "commercial program" [...] to be carried out [...] "as previous to [...] arrival." ...|$|E

60|$|Phineas {{was rather}} melancholy as he {{returned}} alone to Killaloe. It was all very well to bid him stick to the ship, and he knew {{as well as any}} one could tell him how material the ship was to him; but there are circumstances in which a man cannot stick to his ship,--cannot stick, at least, to this special <b>Government</b> <b>ship.</b> He knew that whither Mr. Monk went, in this session, he must follow. He had considerable hope that when Mr. Monk explained his purpose to the Prime Minister, the Prime Minister would feel himself obliged to give way. In that case Phineas would not only be able to keep his office, but would have such an opportunity of making a speech in Parliament as circumstances had never yet given to him. When he was again at home he said nothing to his father or to the Killaloeians as to the danger of his position. Of what use would it be to make his mother and sisters miserable, or to incur the useless counsels of the doctor? They seemed to think his speech at Dublin very fine, and were never tired of talking of what Mr. Monk and Phineas were going to do; but the idea had not come home to them that if Mr. Monk or Phineas chose to do anything on their own account, they must give up the places which they held under the Crown.|$|E

Every man is the lord of a realm beside which the earthly empire of the Czar is but a petty state, a hummock left by the ice. Yet some can be patriotic who have no self-respect, and sacrifice the greater to the less. They love the soil which makes their graves, but have no sympathy with the spirit which may still animate their clay. Patriotism is a maggot in their heads.
