5|$|The {{pavilion}} {{is built}} on a cruciform layout with {{the northern and southern}} ends being longer. The roof is topped with a spire of five-tiers, making it a prasat rather than a 'maha prasat' (which has seven). The spire is supported by swans as opposed to the traditional garudas. The eastern pediment depicts the Hindu god Shiva standing on a plinth with one <b>foot</b> <b>raised,</b> holding a sword in his left hand and right hand raised to a blessing. The columns of the pavilion are decorated with gold and silver glass mosaic in a floral pattern; the capital of these columns take the form of long lotus petals.|$|E

40|$|Name The {{validity}} of specific tests of flexibility toward climbing performance Goal To attest the {{validity of}} specific tests of flexibility in climbing Method 202 subjects were measured, of this number 136 were men 176, 8 cm ± 8, 9 cm tall and weighing in at 68, 9 kg ± 12, 0 kg and 66 were women 168, 2 cm ± 15, 2 cm tall and weighing in at 62, 8 kg ± 13, 1 kg. Specific flexibility was measured through three tests: bent knee <b>foot</b> <b>raise</b> test, straight knee <b>foot</b> <b>raise</b> test and <b>foot</b> loading test. The degree of validity of tests has been expressed by {{the correlation between the}} climbing performance and the results of the specific flexibility tests. Results All the tests were showing medium dependence to the climbing performance with the correlating coefficient values being: bent knee <b>foot</b> <b>raise</b> test r= 0, 49, foot loading test r= 0, 49 straight knee <b>foot</b> <b>raise</b> test r= 0, 44. These correlating coefficients were calculated from the relative values of test results by averaging the left and right foot results and dividing the resulting number by the height of the subject. Summary Tests used are a suitable indicator of climbing specific flexibility. Keywords Validity, flexibility, sport climbin...|$|R

25|$|There is, {{for example}} a {{particular}} motif of several sheep, {{one of which}} has a <b>foot</b> <b>raised</b> to scratch its ear, which occurs in Italy in the 13th and 14th centuries in manuscript illumination, wall paintings and carved stone panels. A motif of paired flying winged figures which is seen on pagan Roman sarcophagi passed into Christian art as a very commonly used portrayal of angels. The reproduction of figures from manuscripts was particularly common in stained glass windows with various Biblia Pauperum being frequent sources.|$|E

25|$|The Gloucestershire Regiment, {{commonly}} referred to as the Glosters, was a line infantry regiment of the British Army from 1881 until 1994. It traced its origins to Colonel Gibson's Regiment of <b>Foot</b> <b>raised</b> in 1694, which later became the 28th (North Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot. The regiment was formed by the merger of the 28th Regiment and the 61st (South Gloucestershire) Regiment of Foot. It inherited the unique privilege in the British Army of wearing a badge on the back of its head-dress as well as the front, an honour won by the 28th Regiment when it fought in two ranks back to back at the Battle of Alexandria in 1801. At its formation the regiment comprised two regular, two militia and two volunteer battalions, and saw its first action during the Second Boer War.|$|E

60|$|The prince had 2500 {{horse with}} him in this expedition, but no foot; the town had some <b>foot</b> <b>raised</b> in the country by Mr Hampden, and two regiments of country militia, whom we made light of, but we found they stood to their tackle better than well enough.

60|$|If {{the swirl}} of a fish among the sedges caught his keen eye, he would change his tactics, letting his game come to him instead of {{stalking}} it, {{as he did with}} the frogs. Whatever his position was, both feet down or one <b>foot</b> <b>raised</b> for a stride, when the fish appeared, he never changed it, knowing well that motion would only send his game hurriedly into deeper water. He would stand sometimes for a half hour on one leg, letting his head sink slowly down on his shoulders, his neck curled back, his long sharp bill pointing always straight at the quivering line which marked the playing fish, his eyes half closed till the right moment came. Then you would see his long neck shoot down, hear the splash and, later, the whack of his catch against the nearest root, to kill it; and watch with curious feelings of sympathy as he hid it in the grass and covered it over, lest Hawahak the hawk should see, or Cheokhes the mink smell it, and rob him while he fished.|$|E
