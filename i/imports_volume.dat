In contrary with traditional specification of using single real income variable, the present study examines the various components of real income that are final consumption expenditure, domestic investment and expenditure on export goods, and relative prices. The 'bounds' testing approach in Pesaran et al. (2001), which based on estimation of unrestricted error-correction model (UECM) was used for cointegration analysis over the sample period 1973 - 1997. The result confirms a cointegrating relation among the quantity of import and its determinants as well as various expenditure components. The various expenditure components provide different impacts on Japan's <b>imports</b> <b>volume</b> in short run. The UECM appears to track the data well...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis article investigates how sectorial {{characteristics}} {{determine the}} probability of industries receiving an anti-dumping (AD) duty, delving into the economic literature on {{the political economy of}} protection, market competition and trade reform in Brazil. By focusing on when the AD was granted, the article concentrates on the objective economic motivations for an industry to claim protection and which are instrumental to the decision of the trade defense authority. The empirical strategy involves a panel of 93 industrial sectors from 1996 to 2007 to create four groups of explanatory variables (collective action/competition, economic performance, factors of production, trade coefficients), reflecting their structural characteristics, market competition, economic performance and political mobilization. The econometric specifications apply binary dependent variable models (logit) with cluster robust and population-averaged error correction. The results show that structure of trade (<b>imports</b> <b>volume</b> and tariffs), economic performance (productivity and investments), and factor content (labor and natural resources) influence the probability of the AD. Political economy characteristics (captured by interactive terms) are also influential in determining the measure...|$|E

40|$|The {{instability}} in exchange rate (appreciation and depreciation in home currency) {{is an important}} factor indetermination of trade balance of a country. Fluctuating exchange rates impacts the decision making of investors and traders, it shatters their confidence which ultimately leads to the slowness of trade process. In this research paper the effect of exchange rate instability is measured on imports and exports of Pakistan. For this purpose Regression analysis is used and it is calculated that if instability is created due to depreciation in home currency (Pak rupee) then it has positive impact on Pakistan‘s exports, while it has absolutely no effect on imports of Pakistan. Since Pak rupee has very limited appreciation during last 20 years so appreciation effect of home currency can not be calculated on Imports and exports of Pakistan. In theoretical prospective the devaluation of home currency should decrease the volume of imports, because it will cost more for Pakistan to import goods from other countries. But our empirical findings show that, {{this is not the case}} between exchange rate and imports of Pakistan. The imports of Pakistan grew even in large figure as the home currency depreciated against other currencies. So this shows that depreciation of home currency do not effect the imports in of Pakistan. Our findings through regression analysis show that by decrease in value of home currency imports of Pakistan increase. So depreciation in home currency has no effect on <b>imports</b> <b>volume...</b>|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} is to {{identify}} regions with the highest dependence on imports and assess the impact of imports on the dynamics of the manufacturing industry’s growth. The methodological framework of the study involves the use of well-known processing methods of regional static data. The paper presents an empirical study of <b>imports</b> <b>volume</b> and structure in the regional manufacturing industry for the period from 2005 to 2014, and groups them {{on the basis of the}} assessment of sustainability indicators. At the regional level, intermediate imports are characterized by a high heterogeneity both in absolute and relative terms. The significant volumes of imports are concentrated in few regions with a high industrial concentration. It allows to allocate regions with the greatest risks for the manufacturing sector in negative external environment. The study demonstrates the relationship of the intermediate imports with the growth dynamics of the manufacturing industry in a certain set of macroeconomic conditions, assuming the economic growth with the stable exchange rate and relatively high growth rate of the producer prices on the domestic market. We also found a positive impact of imports on the growth rate of manufacturing industry in this period due to the effects of market substitution. Thus, the limitation of import substitution in specialized regions at preservation of the basic external factors is emphasized. The obtained results can be used for strategic planning at various levels of management, defining the model and direction for growth of the industrial sector of the region and improving the methodological tools for further empirical research...|$|E
40|$|Foreign capital inflows (FCI) help under-developing {{countries}} {{to cover the}} gap of twin deficits in current and capital accounts by increasing {{the size of their}} Gross Domestic Products (GDP), improving {{the quality and quantity of}} technological domestic means of production, creation of employment, transformation of industrial base for exports orientation and imports substitution to gain favorable Terms of Trade (TOT) and Balance of Payments (BOP) position by changing the composition of current and capital accounts. Pakistan has strong potential if the determinants involved in the transformation of the agrarian structure of the economy to mechanized industrialization improve to induce more foreign investors in capital intensive projects by creating financial co-relation with domestic investors as the country has low access in the international resource markets of invisible items. Foreign Inflows of portfolio investments direct enhances foreign exchange reserves. Aim of this study to explain various factors involved to have more FCI and its impact on macroeconomic indicators like, Growth, Domestic Investment, Inflation and Trade Balance. Trend and Regression Analysis applied to evaluate thirty years secondary data collected from various sources. This Study focused on two Determinants of FCI i. e. 'Foreign Direct Investment' (FDI) and 'Foreign Portfolio Investment' (FPI). For checking interdependency of variables in six separate models are specified taking different macro-economic variables. Before analyzing the Time-Series data, Augmented Ducky Fuller test (ADFT) used to check stationarity of the data of those variables in models. For checking Non-Stationary data by Unit-Root showed that all the variables are not stationary at level but stationary at the first difference. For the analysis of variation in variables and finding long-run relationship, "Johansen'sCo-integration-Test" applied. For detection of short-run impacts of FCI on the selected variables in models "Vector-Error-Correction-Model" (VECM) used. Moreover, for examination of the inter relationship in the FCI with economic growth, domestic investment, consumption and inflation; Granger Causality Test (GCT) applied. For deriving the results, SPSS and E-views utilized. Major findings of the study showed that GDP growth rate positively and significantly affects (0. 147) FCI and negatively affected (- 0. 033) by the inflation rate in the country. FCI affected positively (0. 195) by the interest rate. Exchange rate is positively related (0. 027) to the FCI. Domestic investment affects positively (0. 545) FCI. GDP growth rate positively affects (0. 157) FDI. FDI negatively affected (- 0. 001) by the inflation rate of the country. FDI is affected positively (0. 015) by the interest rate of the country. Exchange rate positively related (0. 030) FDI. Domestic investment affects positively (0. 295) FDI. Exports affect FCI positively (0. 008). GDP growth rate positively affected (1. 083) by FDI in the country. GDP growth rate positively affected (0. 021) by the persistent rise in the general price level (inflation) of economy. Gross-Domestic-Product (GDP) growth rate affected negatively (- 0. 080) by the interest rate of the country. FDI positively affects (1. 479) the domestic investment of the country. Domestic investment positively affected (0. 284) by FCIs. Inflation rate is positively affected (0. 157) by the foreign direct investment to the country. FCI affect the inflation rate positively (0. 467). FCIs affect the balance of trade negatively (- 0. 127). The coefficient is significant at 5 % levels of significance. Balance of trade positively affected (0. 127) by the GDP growth rate of the country. The balance of trade affected positively (0. 237) by the relative prices of imports. Balance of trade negatively affected (- 0. 132) by the relative prices of exports. Foreign exchange reserves and exchange rate affects the balance of trade negatively. Similarly, as the currency depreciates, the exports become less expensive and hence the demand for exports increases in the international markets. Increase in exports lead to improve balance of trade. Incentives should be given to domestic investors to boost GDP and exports. The study revealed that inflation rate; <b>imports</b> <b>volume</b> affects the FCI negatively and has insignificant impact. So the government should control inflation through monetary/fiscal policy and reduce the imports of un-necessary items through restrictions or imports substitution and export orientation...|$|E
