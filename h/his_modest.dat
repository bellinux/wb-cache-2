5|$|Building a full spliced blank {{from scratch}} was an {{expensive}} and painstaking process, {{and the large}} manufacturing facilities of Brunswick turned out good quality blanks, with beautiful points, veneers and sound construction. In Balabushka's case, his entire workshop consisted of a single lathe and other woodworking equipment {{in the confines of}} <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> garage, and building his own full-splice butts would have been prohibitively difficult and expensive for him.|$|E
5|$|Feynman's {{salary was}} $380 a month, about half {{what he needed}} to cover <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> living {{expenses}} and Arline's medical bills. The rest came from her $3,300 in savings. On weekends, Feynman drove to Albuquerque to see his ailing wife in a car borrowed from his good friend Klaus Fuchs. Asked who at Los Alamos was most likely to be a spy, Fuchs speculated that Feynman, with his safe cracking and frequent trips to Albuquerque, was the most likely candidate. When Fuchs confessed to being a spy for the Soviet Union in 1950, this would be seen in a different light. The FBI would compile a bulky file on Feynman.|$|E
5|$|Upon his adoption, Octavius assumed his great-uncle's name Gaius Julius Caesar. Roman {{citizens}} adopted into a {{new family}} usually retained their old nomen in cognomen form (e.g., Octavianus for one who had been an Octavius, Aemilianus for one who had been an Aemilius, etc.). However, though some of his contemporaries did, {{there is no evidence}} that Octavius ever himself officially used the name Octavianus, as it would have made <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> origins too obvious. Historians usually refer to the new Caesar as Octavian during the time between his adoption and his assumption of the name Augustus in 27BC in order to avoid confusing the dead dictator with his heir.|$|E

5|$|On {{leaving the}} Conservatoire in 1853, Saint-Saëns {{accepted}} {{the post of}} organist at the ancient Parisian church of Saint-Merri near the Hôtel de Ville. The parish was substantial, with 26,000 parishioners; in a typical year {{there were more than}} two hundred weddings, the organist's fees from which, together with fees for funerals and <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> basic stipend, gave Saint-Saëns a comfortable income. The organ, the work of François-Henri Clicquot, had been badly damaged {{in the aftermath of the}} French Revolution and imperfectly restored. The instrument was adequate for church services but not for the ambitious recitals that many high-profile Parisian churches offered. With enough spare time to pursue his career as a pianist and composer, Saint-Saëns composed what became his opus 2, the Symphony in E (1853). This work, with military fanfares and augmented brass and percussion sections, caught the mood of the times in the wake of the popular rise to power of Napoleon III and the restoration of the French Empire. The work brought the composer another first prize from the Société Sainte-Cécile.|$|E
25|$|After his death, Noguchi's {{body was}} {{returned}} to the United States; but the Noguchi Prize is arguably poised to become a more meaningful memorial than <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> grave marker in New York City's Woodlawn Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|By 1916, {{the cost}} of Goddard's rocket {{research}} had become too great for <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> teaching salary to bear.

25|$|León de Greiff retired on October 1, 1963, and at {{that time}} he started to enjoy <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> pension after 34 years as a civil servant.

60|$|So Corliss went away, {{glad that}} he had not spoken, and keenly appreciating St. Vincent's craft whereby he had so adroitly forestalled adverse comment by telling the story in <b>his</b> own <b>modest,</b> self-effacing way.|$|R
25|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> {{income from}} the paper, by 1867 Hesing was able to muster $80,000 to buy out his {{remaining}} partner, Lorenz Brentano, and to thereby attain complete control of the Staats-Zeitung. He would subsequently build {{it one of the}} most successful German newspapers in North America, alongside other papers from St. Louis, Milwaukee, and New York City.|$|E
25|$|He was {{recognized}} {{during his lifetime}} in Delft and The Hague, but <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> celebrity gave way to obscurity after his death. He was barely mentioned in Arnold Houbraken's major source book on 17th-century Dutch painting (Grand Theatre of Dutch Painters and Women Artists), and was thus omitted from subsequent surveys of Dutch art for nearly two centuries.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, {{following}} his mother's death, {{he moved to}} Munich, where he would live {{until his death in}} 1936. He lived as a cloistered scholar, supported by <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> inheritance. Spengler survived on very limited means and was marked by loneliness. He owned no books, and took jobs as a tutor or wrote for magazines to earn additional income.|$|E

25|$|Rabbi Grozovsky {{was known}} to lead a simple and sparse life. Sometimes {{he and his wife}} had to borrow money from his students.

25|$|Yves Douleac is {{a driver}} for the Vaillante team. He lost his father, {{a truck driver}} for Vaillante at Marseilles, at 7. He was brought up by his mother {{and he was very}} admirative of Michel Vaillant, getting to know him {{personally}} and being employed as a driver. Courageous and proud, he later fell in love with Gabriele Spangenberg, and succeeded in marrying her despite <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> origin.|$|E
25|$|He {{made his}} debut against Glamorgan in June 1934, taking three wickets in the match {{including}} that of Arnold Dyson in both innings. A fortnight later against Hampshire he claimed a career-best 7-51, {{but he was never}} to achieve anything like that success again, taking more than one wicket in only two more games. He did, however, manage <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> best score with the bat (28) against Lancashire in July.|$|E
25|$|Francia {{consolidated}} {{his power}} by convincing Paraguayans {{that he was}} indispensable. By the end of 1811, dissatisfied with the political role that military officers were playing, he resigned from the junta. From <b>his</b> <b>modest</b> chacra (cottage or hut) at Ibaray, near Asunción, he told the visiting citizens that their revolution had been betrayed, that the change in government had only traded a Spanish-born elite for a criollo one, and that the junta was incompetent.|$|E
50|$|The Souvenir de Hapsal {{was written}} during Tchaikovsky's stay in Hapsal, {{then in the}} Russian Empire (it is now Haapsalu in Estonia).

60|$|But Mr. Mool's {{experience}} was {{equal to the}} call on it. Having fully explained the object that he had in view, he left the apology for his intrusion to be inferred, and concluded by appealing, in <b>his</b> own <b>modest</b> way, to the sympathy of an honourable man.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} said that he may have had a {{connection}} to the mysterious Hannah Courtoy, who possibly funded some of his expeditions and that he may have been behind the design of her Egyptian style tomb which proudly stands just a stones throw from <b>his</b> own <b>modest</b> grave.|$|R
