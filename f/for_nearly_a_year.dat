5|$|After {{a period}} in command of all 2NZEF troops in Egypt, Parkinson {{returned}} to New Zealand in late 1945 and was appointed Quartermaster General of the New Zealand Military Forces, based in Wellington. After serving in this capacity <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> he was posted to London for a three-year term as the New Zealand military liaison officer.

5|$|In July 1940, Graf Zeppelin was towed from Kiel to Gotenhafen (Gdynia) and {{remained}} there <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> While there, {{she was used}} as a storage depot for Germany's hardwood supply. Just before Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the carrier was again moved, this time to Stettin, to safeguard her from Soviet air attacks. By November, the German army had pushed deep enough into Russian territory to remove any further threat of air attack and Graf Zeppelin was returned to Gotenhafen.

5|$|In March 1854, {{the steamer}} Black Warrior {{stopped at the}} Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress {{as a violation of}} American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.|$|E
5|$|In May 1909 Wodehouse {{made his}} second visit to New York, where he sold two short stories to Cosmopolitan and Collier's {{for a total}} of $500, a much higher fee than he had {{commanded}} previously. He resigned from The Globe and stayed in New York <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> He sold many more stories, but none of the American publications offered a permanent relationship and guaranteed income. Wodehouse returned to England in late 1910, rejoining The Globe and also contributing regularly to The Strand Magazine. Between then and the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he revisited America frequently.|$|E

5|$|The Governor of Syria, Publius Petronius, fearing {{civil war}} if the order were carried out, delayed {{implementing}} it <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Agrippa finally convinced Caligula {{to reverse the}} order. But Caligula issued a second order to have his statue erected in the Temple of Jerusalem. In Rome, another statue of himself, of colossal size, was made of gilt brass for such temple. The Temple of Jerusalem was then transformed into a temple for Caligula, and {{it was called the}} Temple of illustrious Gaius the new Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Three weeks later, some {{children}} {{playing in the}} street wandered into the yard of the now-vacant house. One of them fell into the cellar and discovered the tunnel. While the prison's Board of Inspectors was unable to identify the inmate involved in the escape attempt, the warden punished Berkman by sending him to solitary confinement <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> Days after {{he was released from}} solitary, Berkman tried to hang himself with a strip of his blanket.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{began his}} 2015 season with wrist pain {{and was not}} sure whether he would play Sydney and the Australian Open. However, {{at the last minute}} he decided to play both tournaments. He had not played a tournament since February 2014, but he started the 2015 Apia International Sydney with a straight-sets win against Sergiy Stakhovsky. In the second round, his {{opponent}} was world No. 19 and top seed Fabio Fognini. It was a tough test for del Potro, but he proved to be stronger than the Italian. Del Potro was through to the quarterfinals, but lost to Mikhail Kukushkin in two tiebreakers. After his Sydney campaign, he was drawn to play Jerzy Janowicz {{in the first round of}} the 2015 Australian Open, del Potro withdrew due to his wrist injury.

5|$|Halo 2 {{was officially}} {{announced}} in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer, subsequently packaged with Halo: Combat Evolved DVDs. A real-time gameplay video was shown at E3 2003, {{which was the}} first actual gameplay seen by the public; it showcased new features such as dual-wielding and improved graphics. Many elements of the trailer, however, were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded, and the trailer's environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on how big the game environments could be. The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of Halo 2 <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 the {{producer}} Basil Dean offered Gielgud the lead role, Lewis Dodd, in a dramatisation of Margaret Kennedy's best-selling novel, The Constant Nymph. Before rehearsals began Dean {{found that a}} bigger star than Gielgud was available, namely Coward, to whom he gave the part. Gielgud had an enforceable contractual claim to the role, but Dean, a notorious bully, was a powerful force in British theatre. Intimidated, Gielgud accepted the position of understudy, with a guarantee {{that he would take}} over the lead from Coward when the latter, who disliked playing in long runs, left. In the event Coward, who had been overworking, suffered a nervous collapse three weeks after the opening night, and Gielgud played the lead {{for the rest of the}} run. The play ran <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> in London and then went on tour.|$|E
5|$|In 1934 Wodehouse {{moved to}} France for tax reasons; in 1940 {{he was taken}} {{prisoner}} at Le Touquet by the invading Germans and interned <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> After his release he made six broadcasts from German radio in Berlin to the US, which had not yet entered the war. The talks were comic and apolitical, but his broadcasting over enemy radio prompted anger and strident controversy in Britain, and a threat of prosecution. Wodehouse never returned to England. From 1947 until his death {{he lived in the}} US, taking dual British-American citizenship in 1955. He was a prolific writer throughout his life, publishing more than ninety books, forty plays, two hundred short stories and other writings between 1902 and 1974. He died in 1975, at the age of 93, in Southampton, New York.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1907, Kafka {{was hired}} at the , an {{insurance}} company, {{where he worked}} <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> His correspondence during that period indicates that he was unhappy with a working time schedule—from 08:00 until 18:00—making it extremely difficult to concentrate on writing, which was assuming increasing importance to him. On 15 July 1908, he resigned. Two weeks later he found employment more amenable to writing {{when he joined the}} Worker's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. The job involved investigating and assessing compensation for personal injury to industrial workers; accidents such as lost fingers or limbs were commonplace at this time owing to poor work safety policies at the time. It was especially true of factories fitted with machine lathes, drills, planing machines and rotary saws which were rarely fitted with safety guards.|$|E
5|$|Ordered {{as part of}} the 1910 Naval Programme, Amphion {{was laid}} down at Pembroke Dockyard's No. 5 Slipway on 15 March 1911 and {{launched}} on 4 December by Mrs. Mundy, wife of the dockyard's Captain-Superintendent, Captain Geoffrey Mundy. She was completed in March 1913 and her first commander was Captain Frederic Dreyer with Lieutenant John Tovey as his First Lieutenant. Amphion was commissioned on 2 April and assigned to the 4th Battle Squadron of the First Fleet. A month later, the ship was assigned to the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron by 18 May. She remained with the squadron <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> and was serving as the flotilla leader of the 3rd Destroyer Flotilla by 18 June 1914.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{began the}} siege, but was {{frustrated}} {{in his attempt}} to take it, and the siege dragged on <b>for</b> <b>nearly</b> <b>a</b> <b>year.</b> During this time, there were two failed Athenian attempts to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible.|$|E
