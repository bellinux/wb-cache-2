5|$|On {{his way to}} the gallows, Beauchamp {{asked to}} see Patrick Darby, who was among the {{assembled}} spectators. Beauchamp smiled and offered his hand, but Darby declined the gesture. Beauchamp publicly denied that Darby had any involvement with the murder, but accused Darby of having lied about the 1824 meeting. Darby denied this accusation of perjury and tried to engage Beauchamp in a discussion about it, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> would retract the charge, but the prisoner ordered the cart driver to continue to the gallows.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Diệm {{had little}} {{authority}} beyond {{the gates of}} his own palace. Bảo Đại had little confidence in him and gave him meagre support—the pair had clashed in the past, with Diem resigning as Bảo Đại's Interior Minister two decades earlier, believing {{the head of state}} to be weak and ineffective. Many historians believe that Bảo Đại may have selected Diệm for the latter's ability to attract U.S. support and funding. During the transition period, the French Expeditionary Corps maintained a presence in South Vietnam. This led to tension between France and the State of Vietnam. Diệm, a passionate nationalist, detested the French, who reciprocated, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> would fail, even calling for his removal on occasions.|$|E

60|$|Young John replied, with acknowledgments, that <b>he</b> only <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> {{did what}} was right, and what showed how entirely he {{was devoted to}} Miss Dorrit. He wished to be unselfish; and <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> was. He wished to do {{anything}} as laid {{in his power to}} serve Miss Dorrit, altogether putting himself out of sight; and <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> did. It was but little that he could do, but <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> did it.|$|R

5|$|By 23:30 on her own, Moltke {{encountered}} four British dreadnoughts, {{from the}} rear division of the 2nd Battle Squadron. Moltkes commander Kapitän von Karpf ordered the ship to swing away, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> had not been detected. The British ships in fact had seen Moltke, but had decided to not open fire in order to not reveal their location to the entire German fleet. At 23:55, and again at 00:20, Kapitän von Karpf {{tried to find a}} path through the British fleet, but both times was unable to do so. It was not until 01:00, after having steamed far ahead of the Grand Fleet, that Moltke was able to make good her escape.|$|E
5|$|Dannemann, {{the only}} {{eyewitness}} to Hendrix's final hours, said that sometime after 3 a.m., she prepared two tuna fish sandwiches for them after arriving {{back at her}} basement apartment. Around 4 a.m., Hendrix, struggling with insomnia after having consumed amphetamines hours earlier, asked her for sleeping tablets. She later said she refused his request <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> would fall asleep naturally. Dannemann said she surreptitiously took a sleeping tablet sometime around 6 a.m., with Hendrix still awake. She awoke sometime between 10 and 10:20a.m. to find him sleeping normally in bed next to her. She said she then left to purchase cigarettes, and when she returned around 11 a.m., found him in bed breathing, although unconscious and unresponsive. She telephoned for an ambulance at 11:18a.m. and one arrived at 11:27a.m.|$|E
5|$|Joseph married Max Joseph's sister, Maria Josepha, in 1765, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> {{could claim}} the Bavarian {{electorate}} for his offspring. After {{two years of}} unhappy marriage, Maria Josepha died without issue. When Max Joseph died ten years later, Joseph could only present a weak legal claim to Lower Bavaria through a dubious and ancient grant made by the Emperor Sigismund to the House of Habsburg in 1425. Knowing its poor legal grounds, Joseph negotiated a secret agreement with Charles Theodore shortly after Max Joseph's death. In this agreement (3 January 1778), Charles Theodore ceded Lower Bavaria to Austria in exchange for uncontested succession to {{the remainder of the}} duchy. Charles Theodore also hoped to acquire from Joseph some unencumbered parts of the Austrian Netherlands and parts of Anterior Austria that he could bequeath to his bastards, but this was not written into the agreement and Joseph was not a particularly generous man. Furthermore, the agreement entirely ignored the interests of Charles Theodore's own heir presumptive, Charles II August, of the House of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld. Charles August was the presumptive heir of Charles Theodore's domains and titles. He had a clear and direct interest in the disposition of the Bavarian duchy, especially in its territorial integrity.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Sweet at The Bronze, Buffy {{offers a}} deal to Sweet: she will {{take the place of}} her sister if she can’t kill him. When asked by Sweet what she thinks about life, Buffy gives her pessimistic take on its meaning ("Something to Sing About"). When the others arrive, she divulges that Willow took her from heaven, and Willow reacts with horror at finding out what she’s done. Upon divulging this truth, Buffy gives up on singing and dances so frenetically that she begins to smoke — on the verge of combusting as Sweet’s other victims have been shown to do — until Spike stops her, telling her {{that the only way to}} go forward is to just keep living her life. Xander then reveals that he, not Dawn, called Sweet, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> would be shown a happy ending for his {{marriage}} plans. Sweet, after releasing Xander from the obligation to be Sweet's “bride”, tells the group how much fun they have been ("What You Feel—Reprise") and disappears. The Scoobies realize that their relationships have been changed irreversibly by the secrets revealed in their songs ("Where Do We Go from Here?"). Spike leaves The Bronze, but Buffy follows him out, and they kiss ("Coda").|$|E

He appears briefly in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, when Harry asks him {{to bring him to}} the Grey Lady.|$|E

25|$|After {{three seasons}} in Minnesota, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Walker in 1992 <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> {{would be the}} final {{ingredient}} they needed to reach the Super Bowl. That year, he enjoyed his best season as a Pro since 1988, rushing for 1,070 yards. In 1994 {{he became the first}} NFL player to have one-play gains of 90 or more yards rushing, receiving and kick-returning in a single season. He spent three seasons in Philadelphia, leaving after the Eagles signed free agent Ricky Watters.|$|E

Marisa {{secretly}} flirts with Ray, who tells her they could take the medallion for themselves. Ray and Thomas then rescue the gun runner, who is wrapped in bandages, and return him to Mendoza. In private, he reveals himself to be Barnsby, telling Mendoza if he wants the rifles, he must hand over the McCalls. Meanwhile, Ray brags to Thomas and William of his plans with Marisa. Thomas goes to see Marisa, who says she was using Ray, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> would kill Mendoza, when she is actually in love with Thomas.|$|E
25|$|In September 1880, Behan and Sadie left Tip Top for Tombstone. Soon {{after they}} arrived, Behan's ex-wife sent their eight-year-old son Albert {{to live with}} him. In reconstructing her life story, Josephine said years later that she {{actually}} lived with Kitty Jones and her husband, a lawyer, {{while working as a}} housekeeper for Behan. Boyer and other modern researchers argue that she actually lived with Behan. In Josephine's version of her life story, she left San Francisco to join Behan to Tombstone in October, 1880, and was <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> would fulfill his promises to marry her. When he delayed, she was ready to leave him.|$|E

25|$|Time {{passed and}} Tuyến {{began to show}} displeasure at the {{increasing}} interference of Nhu's wife, Madame Nhu into politics; displeasure turned to offense and Nhu began to ignore Tuyến. In early 1963, Tuyến was ordered by Diệm {{to go home and}} rest because the latter thought the former had been too lenient with disillusioned military officers and politicians who were veering towards opposition. Tuyến was never recalled to work. Instead, Tuyến responded by dispatching his staff back to their former position they had held before they joined his department, leaving the intelligence bureau in a state of collapse. In May, when the Buddhist crisis erupted after Diệm's forces had banned Buddhists from flying the Buddhist flag to commemorate Vesak, and fatally fired on them, Diệm recalled Tuyến, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> could resolve the crisis.|$|E
25|$|Out of options, Constantine slits his wrists. As he bleeds out, Lucifer arrives to {{personally}} collect his soul. Constantine tells Lucifer of Mammon's plan to usurp him without his knowledge. Lucifer easily overpowers Gabriel, burns Gabriel's wings and banishes Mammon. In return for his help, Lucifer grants Constantine any wish. Constantine asks that Isabel {{be released to}} Heaven. Lucifer complies, but then realizes that he cannot take Constantine to Hell as a consequence. By selflessly sacrificing himself, Constantine is granted entry to Heaven. Infuriated, Lucifer heals Constantine's injuries and cures him of his lung cancer, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> will eventually make a mistake and damn himself again.

25|$|Rikki Clarke (born 29 September 1981 in Orsett, Essex) is an English cricketer, {{currently}} {{playing for}} Surrey. He was educated at Broadwater School and then Godalming College. Clarke {{began his career}} as a professional cricketer with Surrey in 2000, making his list A debut in 2001 and First Class debut in 2002, and the following year made his One Day International debut for England; later in 2003 he played his first Test match. Between 2003 and 2006 he played two Tests, both against Bangladesh and 20ODIs. At the end of 2007 Clarke left Surrey to become Derbyshire's club captain after feeling a change was needed, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> could impress the England selectors with his leadership. Before the end of the 2008 season he stepped down as captain because the job was negatively affecting his own performance, and after a single year at the club he left to join Warwickshire for the start of the 2009 season.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Childress {{promoted}} 25-year-old Busch Series driver Johnny Sauter to the ride, <b>hoping</b> <b>he</b> {{would rise}} to the occasion like Harvick had in 2001. Kevin Hamlin moved over from the 31 team to serve as Sauter's crew chief. Sauter had helped secure the 2003 Busch Series owner's championship in a partial schedule with RCR, while finishing 8th in driver points. Sauter failed to score a top ten, ranked {{at the bottom of the}} Raybestos Rookie standings, and was released just 13 races into the season. After that, Dave Blaney drove the car, only skipping Infineon Raceway when Jim Inglebright took the wheel. A couple of weeks after it was announced Blaney would be in the car for rest of the year, Jeff Burton became available after parting ways with Roush Racing's No. 99 car, leaving Blaney out in the cold. Burton was signed to a multi-year contract and drove the car for the rest of the year beginning at Michigan in August. When Robby Gordon left to start his own team, Burton moved to the 31.|$|E

When released, Steven goes off his medication.
