5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with magnetic resonance <b>imaging</b> <b>and</b> blood tests. Treatment {{is by the}} timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The first case of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E

5|$|The initial {{steps for}} {{evaluating}} {{a person with}} a suspected subarachnoid hemorrhage are obtaining a medical history and performing a physical examination.

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{close-up}} <b>imaging</b> <b>and</b> mechanical problems that greatly restricted the amount of data returned, several significant discoveries were made during Galileos primary mission. Galileo observed {{the effects of a}} major eruption at Pillan Patera and confirmed that volcanic eruptions are composed of silicate magmas with magnesium-rich mafic and ultramafic compositions. Distant imaging of Io was acquired for almost every orbit during the primary mission, revealing large numbers of active volcanoes (both thermal emission from cooling magma on the surface and volcanic plumes), numerous mountains with widely varying morphologies, and several surface changes that had taken place both between the Voyager and Galileo eras and between Galileo orbits.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of CSF leak can be {{done through}} various imaging techniques, {{chemical}} tests of bodily fluid discharged from a head orifice, or by a clinical examination. The use of CT, MRI, and assays {{are the most common}} types of CSF leak instrumental tests. Many CSF leaks do not show up on <b>imaging</b> <b>and</b> chemical assays, thus such diagnostic tools are not definitive to rule out CSF leaks. A clinician may often depend upon patient history and exam to diagnose, for example: discharge of excessive amount of clear fluid from the nose upon bending over, the increase in headache following a Valsalva maneuver or the reduction of headache when the patient takes a prone position are positive indicators.|$|E

5|$|In January 1998, Marburger became {{president}} of Brookhaven Science Associates, which subsequently won a bid to operate Brookhaven National Laboratory for the federal government, and he became {{the director of the}} lab. He took office after a highly publicized scandal in which tritium leaked from the lab's High Flux Beam Reactor, leading to calls by activists to shut down the lab. Rather than directly oppose the activists, Marburger created policies that improved the environmental management of the lab as well as community involvement and transparency. Marburger also presided over the commissioning of the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, expanded the lab's program in medical <b>imaging</b> <b>and</b> neuroscience, and placed more emphasis on its technology transfer program.|$|E
5|$|Noble gases {{have very}} low boiling and melting points, {{which makes them}} useful as {{cryogenic}} refrigerants. In particular, liquid helium, which boils at , is used for superconducting magnets, such as those needed in nuclear magnetic resonance <b>imaging</b> <b>and</b> nuclear magnetic resonance. Liquid neon, although it does not reach temperatures as low as liquid helium, also finds use in cryogenics because it has over 40times more refrigerating capacity than liquid helium and over three times more than liquid hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|The rings were {{investigated}} in detail during the Voyager 2 spacecraft's flyby of Neptune in August 1989. They were studied with optical <b>imaging,</b> <b>and</b> through observations of occultations in ultraviolet and visible light. The spaceprobe observed the rings in different geometries {{relative to the}} Sun, producing images of back-scattered, forward-scattered and side-scattered light. Analysis of these images allowed derivation of the phase function (dependence of the ring's reflectivity on the angle between the observer and Sun), and geometrical and Bond albedo of ring particles. Analysis of Voyager's images also led to discovery of six inner moons of Neptune, including the Adams ring shepherd Galatea.|$|E
40|$|A volume {{hologram}} has two degenerate Bragg-phase-matching {{dimensions and}} provides the capability of volume holographic imaging. We demonstrate two volume holographic <b>imaging</b> architectures <b>and</b> investigate their <b>imaging</b> resolution, aberration, <b>and</b> sensitivity. The first architecture uses the hologram directly as an objective imaging element where strong aberration is observed and confirmed by simulation. The second architecture uses an <b>imaging</b> lens <b>and</b> a transmission geometry hologram to achieve linear two-dimensional optical sectioning <b>and</b> <b>imaging</b> of a four-dimensional (spatial plus spectral dimensions) object hyperspace. Multiplexed holograms can achieve simultaneously three-dimensional imaging of an object without a scanning mechanism...|$|R

Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal <b>imaging</b> <b>and</b> for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

High-end casual clothing retailer Anthropologie has used Scene7's services {{to create and}} deploy online catalogs for its e-commerce website since November 9, 2004. The retailer implemented Scene7's Dynamic Imaging service to let customers zoom in on products, similar to how merchandise is inspected in retail stores.

5|$|The {{cause of}} Alzheimer's disease is poorly understood. About 70% {{of the risk}} is {{believed}} to be genetic with many genes usually involved. Other risk factors include a history of head injuries, depression, or hypertension. The disease process is associated with plaques and tangles in the brain. A probable diagnosis is based {{on the history of the}} illness and cognitive testing with medical <b>imaging</b> <b>and</b> blood tests to rule out other possible causes. Initial symptoms are often mistaken for normal ageing. Examination of brain tissue is needed for a definite diagnosis. Mental and physical exercise, and avoiding obesity may decrease the risk of AD; however, evidence to support these recommendations is not strong. There are no medications or supplements that decrease risk.|$|E
