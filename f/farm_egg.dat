The [...] "Land Degradation" [...] section of the United Nations report Livestock's Long Shadow concludes that [...] "Intensification - in terms of increased productivity both in livestock production and in feed crop agriculture - can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation". Nathan Pelletier of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia found that cattle raised on open pastures release 50% more greenhouse gas emissions than cattle raised in factory farms. Adrian Williams of Cranfield University in England found that free range and organic raised chickens have a 20% greater impact on global warming than chickens raised in factory farm conditions, and organic egg production had a 14% higher impact on the climate than factory <b>farm</b> <b>egg</b> production. Studies such as Christopher Weber's report on food miles have shown that the total amount of greenhouse gas emissions in production far outweighs those in transportation, which implies that locally grown food is actually worse for the environment than food made in factory farms.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{evaluate}} the effects of the age of ostriches and month of laying on egg production and chick growth. On a small ostrich <b>farm</b> <b>egg</b> production, egg incubation and chick growth from hatching to 56 days of age were recorded from 2000, when the breeders were 5 years old, until 2002. Ostriches were kept in groups and fed commercial feed. In all, 568 eggs were laid and weighed at laying and during incubation (at 15 th and 30 th day of incubation), while 353 chicks were weighed at hatching, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days of age. The female’s productivity was calculated assuming a laying of 3. 5 eggs per week and ranged between 45 % and 48 %. The fertility was around 70 % with a peak of 74 % recorded in 2001. The hatchability of all eggs was higher than 62 % with a peak of 72 % in 2001, while the hatchability of fertile eggs was higher than 90 %. In each year the number of eggs laid increased from March to July, productivity showed a positive trend from May to June, while the fertility and hatchability of all eggs, as well as fertile eggs, was unaffected by year and month. As the hens aged, the egg mass grew constantly with an increase of about 8 %. During the first 30 days of incubation the egg weight decreased with the percentages of weight loss around 10. 0 %. At hatching, the weight of chick ranged between 765 g and 847 g, respectively, in 2000 and 2002. Egg weight influenced the hatching weight showing a linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 84). The effect of egg weight on the chick weight decreased as the chick grew. At 56 days of age, only the effect of year is significant. The month of laying did not demonstrate any effect on chicken weight...|$|E

The informations and data on farm, laying hen hall, breeding facility, breeding conditions, the behavior of the laying hens, nutrition, feeding and egg production were obtained by personal visit an organic farm and informations which    the farmer records and stores. The informations about the behavior of laying hens were obtained by observing and comparing with the knowledge and data of the Slovak Government regulation on December 11, 2002, which     minimum standards determine for the protection of laying hens.
