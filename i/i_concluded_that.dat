5|$|As I sifted the {{evidence}} this became {{less and less}} convincing to me until <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the opposite was closer to the truth: that the Métis grievances were at least partly of their own making; {{that the government was}} on the verge of resolving them when the Rebellion broke out; That Riel's resort to arms could not be explained by the failure of constitutional agitation and that he received a surprisingly fair trial.|$|E
25|$|On 4 March 2009, the ICC {{issued a}} warrant of arrest for Omar Al Bashir, President of Sudan as the ICC Pre-Trial Chamber <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> his {{position}} as head of state does not grant him immunity against prosecution before the ICC. The warrant was for war crimes and crimes against humanity. It {{did not include the}} crime of genocide because the majority of the Chamber did not find that the prosecutors had provided enough evidence to include such a charge. Later the decision was changed by the Appeals Panel and after issuing the second decision, charges against Omar al-Bashir include three counts of genocide.|$|E
500|$|In his memoirs, Grant {{reacted to}} {{criticism}} of his lack of entrenchments: [...] "Besides this, the troops with me, officers and men, needed discipline and drill {{more than they did}} experience with the pick, shovel and axe. ... under all these circumstances <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> drill and discipline were worth more to our men than fortifications." [...] Lew Wallace's division was [...] downstream (north) from Pittsburg Landing, at Crump's Landing, a position intended to prevent the placement of Confederate river batteries, to protect the road connecting Crump's Landing to Bethel Station, Tennessee, and to guard the Union army's right flank. In addition, Wallace's troops could strike the railroad line connecting Bethel Station to Corinth, about [...] to the south.|$|E

60|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Badman did die impenitent, {{and so a}} death most miserable.|$|R
5000|$|Shall <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the {{knowledge}} of civil right {{is not at all}} useful for the orator? ...|$|R
2500|$|Opposition to condoms did {{not only}} come from moralists: {{by the late}} 19th century many feminists {{expressed}} distrust of the condom as a contraceptive, as its use was controlled and decided upon by men alone. They advocated instead for methods which were controlled by women, such as diaphragms and spermicidal douches. [...] Despite social and legal opposition, {{at the end of}} the 19th century the condom was the Western world's most popular birth control method. Two surveys conducted in New York in 1890 and 1900 found that 45% of the women surveyed were using condoms to prevent pregnancy. [...] A survey in Boston just prior to World War <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> three million condoms were sold in that city every year.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. It {{would be}} a sorry jest, ma'am. I thought you knew. <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the {{recruiting}} sergeant had talked.|$|E
60|$|For {{hour after}} hour I lay {{thinking}} and in an irritated way listening for the chimes of the Ragnall stable-clock which once had adorned the tower {{of the church and}} struck the quarters with a damnable reiteration. <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> Messrs. Harût and Marût were a couple of common Arab rogues such as I had seen performing at the African ports. Then a quarter struck and <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> the elephants' cemetery which I beheld in the smoke undoubtedly existed and that I meant to collar those thousands of pounds' worth of ivory before I died. Then after another quarter <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> there was no elephants' cemetery--although by the way my old friend, Dogeetah or Brother John, had mentioned such a thing to me--but that probably there was a tribe, as he had also mentioned, called the Kendah, who worshipped a baby, or rather its effigy.|$|E
30|$|By this <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the {{reported}} results most likely are robust since the pattern and the estimates barely varied when switching treatment year.|$|R
60|$|By all which <b>I</b> <b>conclude,</b> <b>that</b> {{he did not}} desire a sence and {{sight of}} his sin, that he might repent and be saved.|$|R
2500|$|... "On {{the basis}} of the foregoing, <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the French Law of 12 June 2001 is not {{incompatible}} with the Council of Europe’s values." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{you wanted}} as many chances as {{possible}} {{of talking to}} some one else in private; so I gave you as many as I could." ...|$|E
60|$|For Samoa, {{from his}} utter silence {{hitherto}} as to aught inebriating on board, <b>I</b> <b>concluded,</b> <b>that,</b> {{along with his}} other secrets, the departed captain had very wisely kept his Otard to himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess the}} fools have opened up, Steele," [...] I said. His {{response}} was an angry grunt. It {{was just as}} well, <b>I</b> <b>concluded,</b> <b>that</b> things had begun to stir. Steele needed to be roused.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing whatever. At {{one time}} I did think the deacon meant {{to make his}} testament; but <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> he must have changed his mind." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> {{the free}} man of color, {{mentioned}} in your letter, if {{born in the}} United States, is {{a citizen of the}} United States. in original ...|$|R
5000|$|... 30. Seeing the elephants, {{snakes and}} birds in bondage, the {{eclipse of the}} sun and the moon and the poverty of the wise men <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> destiny is inevitable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Bryan! I know not. He and I parted in the {{mountains}} some hours ago; and as he failed to keep his appointment with me, <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> he must have become foot-sore and returned to camp." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jasper {{was among}} the first to congratulate him, which he did so heartily that <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> he had stopped his visits in time, and it was with a {{repetition}} of his former kindness that he added: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wounded? I had {{not seen}} his wound. I saw him sitting alive and {{apparently}} unhurt in his caleche, and <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> he had killed you as he had said he would. What else could I conclude?" ...|$|E
60|$|THE WOMAN. <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> your Travellers' Club is an {{assembly}} {{of persons who}} wish {{to be able to}} say that they have been in some place where nobody else has been.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{powerful}} {{glad to see}} yer, Mr. Harnett; for <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> you've {{forgotten all}} about the promise you made to drive out an' see us every time you had the chance." ...|$|R
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> {{the criticisms}} {{about the use}} of Roundup by Seralini et al. were not {{relevant}} to the experiment, which was concerned with the material used in agricultural practice, not with glyphosate itself.|$|R
60|$|FAITH. I did {{not know}} him at first; but, as He went by, I {{perceived}} the holes in His hands and His side; then <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> He was our Lord. So I went up the hill.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> {{it was my}} duty, then, to free {{myself as}} quickly as {{possible}} from the bonds which the members of the Model Club had placed upon me. But this idea was more easily conceived than carried out.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{asked you}} to write to a certain address in that letter I sent you," [...] said Flower, [...] "and when I came back to England and found there was no letter, <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> you couldn’t forgive me." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>conclude,</b> <b>that</b> {{these things}} are either {{suddenly}} injected by the devil, or else are the fruits of that body of sin and death that yet dwells within thee, or perhaps from both together.|$|R
30|$|From this {{exercise}} <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> in practice relative (or scaled) acceleration errors with an rms {{value of a}} few 10 − 7 and maximum ∼ 10 times larger are accepted in N-body simulations of collisional stellar dynamics.|$|R
60|$|As none {{of these}} authors make any mention of a {{communication}} between {{the cells of the}} pith, <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the sap they are filled with is taken up by them, and used to construct their own thickening tissue.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{they are}} the tallest, the handsomest, and Dora, at least, is the stoutest; and as your friend Mr. Sweeting is but a little slight figure, <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that,</b> {{according}} to a frequent rule in such cases, he preferred his contrast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is curious, for I {{did when}} I was half asleep fancy that I heard {{something}} of the sort. I waited quite a time, {{but there was no}} more of it, so <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> it was all a dream." ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{he peered}} {{in at the}} window again, never {{making an effort to}} look through any other, and <b>I</b> <b>concluded</b> <b>that</b> from such {{position}} he could see the prisoner he had most reason to hate, which, of course, must be Darius.|$|E
30|$|<b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that,</b> {{contrary}} to the criticisms, SD rats are the appropriate animal for these experiments precisely because of their susceptibility to late tumorogenesis, in agreement with Meyer and Hillbeck [7]. This idea is taken further in the “Discussion” section.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going into}} the office, {{and if it is}} Miss Cornelia I warn you that I'll eavesdrop," [...] said Gilbert. [...] "From all I've heard {{regarding}} Miss Cornelia <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> her conversation will not be dull, to say the least." ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I review three {{different}} {{positions on the}} wave function, namely: nomological realism, dispositionalism, and configuration space realism by regarding as essential their capacity {{to account for the}} world of our experience. <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> the first two positions are committed to regard the wave function as an abstract entity. The third position will be shown to be a merely speculative attempt to derive a primitive ontology from a reified mathematical space. Without entering any discussion about nominalism, <b>I</b> <b>conclude</b> <b>that</b> an elimination of abstract entities from one’s ontology commits one to instrumentalism about the wave function, a position that therefore is not as unmotivated as it has seemed to be to many philosophers...|$|R
