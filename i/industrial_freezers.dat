40|$|Abstract—This paper {{outlines}} {{the first steps}} to enable a set of large <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer</b> warehouse units to act as flexible loads in a smart grid setting. We describe the modeling and identification of individual freezer units, focusing on the governing thermal dynamics and corresponding electric-energy consumption. By relying on the model identified, we show how optimal supervisory control inputs can be computed {{with the goal of}} tracking a predefined power consumption schedule. Our algorithm is applied to a real freezer warehouse, and its performance with respect to power reference tracking is evaluated and discussed. We show that the freezer system can follow a predefined power schedule despite the currently limited availability of actuators. I...|$|R
5000|$|Kuklinski {{earned the}} {{nickname}} [...] "The Iceman" [...] {{because of his}} experiments in disguising {{the time of death}} of his victims by freezing their corpses in an <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer.</b> Later, he told Carlo that he got the idea from fellow hitman Robert Pronge, nicknamed [...] "Mister Softee", who drove a Mister Softee truck to appear inconspicuous. Pronge taught Kuklinski the different methods of using cyanide to kill his victims. Kuklinski also claimed to have purchased remotely detonated hand grenades from Pronge. Pronge allegedly asked him to carry out a hit on Pronge's own wife and child, which would have been against Kuklinski's stated code against killing women and children. In 1984, Pronge was found shot to death in his truck.|$|R
5000|$|On September 25, 1983, Kuklinski {{made another}} {{significant}} mistake when Louis Masgay {{was found dead}} near a town park off Clausland Mountain Road in Orangetown, New York, with a bullet hole in his head. Kuklinski, {{as he had done}} many times before, attempted to disguise Masgay's time of death by storing his corpse in an <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer</b> for two years. This time, Kuklinski did not allow the body to thaw completely before he dumped it. The Rockland County medical examiner found ice crystals inside the body on a warm September day. Had the body thawed completely before discovery, the medical examiner stated that he probably would have never noticed Kuklinski's trickery. This discovery helped authorities to deduce that Kuklinski used a freezer as part of his modus operandi and led them to give Kuklinski the nickname [...] "Iceman".|$|R

All rights reservedin the last decade that inventive minds and modern techniques have found new ways to exploit the uniquely beneficial properties of this remarkable substance. This paper traces the development of the old carbon dioxide systems, considers the technical, commercial and social reasons for their slow development and subsequent decline and examines the recent renaissance across a surprisingly broad range of applications, from trans-critical car air conditioners to low temperature <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer</b> plants. The paper then concentrates on industrial refrigeration systems, which were the basis of early developments in the period 1865 – 1885, but which have been somewhat overlooked in the current renaissance. The paper concludes with a review of possible future developments, indicating the areas of research and product development required to maximise the potential of the only non-toxic, non-flammable, non-ozone-depleting, non-global-warming refrigerant available for Rankine cycle vapour compression systems in the 21 st century...|$|R
50|$|Using his {{vacation}} days, Jim engages in a stint of undercover {{work at the}} same hotel as the drug dealer is employed and comes to discover {{that all of the}} merchandise the dealer and his gang move is taken to one building, and never moved again. David, after acquiring blueprints from the local planning office, discovers the dealer and his gang have built a large safe in the back of an <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer</b> in the building. Realising it is an easy hit, Jim and David scour items required for the heist, including a diamond tipped drill and unlicensed firearms, paying for them with illegally acquired cash from a corrupt colleague. They break into the apartment above the freezer building and muffle its two occupants, but Jim ends up shooting and killing one after he attempts to escape. After drilling and the use of improvised explosives, they are able to unlock and access the vault. David, who has become attached to the surviving female hostage, allows her to call her 3-year-old son's father to assure him that she is okay.|$|R

50|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Petra Collins and was released on July 26, 2017. The video opens with three shots of {{what appears to be}} Gomez soaking wet with her hair dripping seductively over her face in mirror images then shows Gomez in a pale-yellow dress, carrying bags of groceries similar to the song's cover artwork, on a seemingly normal suburban street, in a role that appears to be a beleaguered housewife, as noted by Stereogum. As the video progresses, Gomez takes part in a range of strange activities. Inside a suburban home, the singer is seen soaking wet (similar to the opening shots earlier) in a dining table with water sprinkling as if it is raining, with candles in the scenery. Then she eats soap, finds a broken glass of wine and proceeds to taste one of the broken fragments, puts lipstick over her teeth, ties a rope around her tongue into a bow, inserting her tongue through an eyelash curler and then writhes around on the kitchen floor, while Gucci Mane raps his verse in a smoky lit underground basement. The clip ends with a shot of Gomez smiling inside an <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer.</b>|$|R
25|$|Regional impacts {{from the}} {{unpredictable}} operation of wind power {{has created a}} new need for interactive demand response, where the utility communicates with the demand. Historically this was only done in cooperation with large industrial consumers, but now may be expanded to entire grids. For instance a few large scale projects in Europe link variations in wind power to change <b>industrial</b> food <b>freezer</b> loads, causing small variations in temperature. If communicated on a grid-wide scale, small changes to heating/cooling temperatures would instantly change consumption across the grid.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{production}} of kiwi fruits {{is a dynamic}} agricultural activity in Corsica (France). The fruits are either consumed directly or used to produce kiwi wine. They are often stored for 4 - 6 months in <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer</b> chambers at 0 C or industrial ozone chambers. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure physical, chemical and fungicidal parameters, soluble sugars and non-volatile organic acids during storage in each of these types of chamber. Various standard and instrumental methods (physicochemical techniques, HPLC) in conjunction with statistical analysis were used. During storage, the kiwi mass, firmness and acidity decreased, whereas reducing sugar, Brix and pH increased. There were statistical differences between the two chambers regarding reducing sugar and acidity. The ozone gas treatment had a fungicidal effect on Botrytis cinerea. The major soluble sugar present in the kiwi fruit was fructose, followed by glucose and sucrose. The concentrations of these sugars increased during storage in both air at 0 C and ozoneenriched air. Organic acids are one of the important factors influencing fruit flavour. Citric and quinic acids predominated over malic, tartaric and ascorbic acids. During storage in the ozone chamber, concentrations of non-volatile organic acids decreased sharply after 25 weeks. Storage at 0 C enabled better retention of organic acids...|$|R

Unwilling to give up, Charly locates Caitlin by the candle her previous self, Samantha, had given Caitlin, {{telling her that}} wherever she lit it Samantha would find it. While rescuing Caitlin both are captured by Timothy after a shoot out. Charly learns from Timothy {{the true nature of}} his relationship with Perkins and their mission: [...] "Project Honeymoon" [...] was a false flag chemical bomb detonation in downtown Niagara Falls, New York, planned out by the CIA, used to place blame on Islamic terrorists and to secure more funding and power for the department. Timothy and Perkins are plotting to restage the attack. Charly implores Timothy not to hurt Caitlin, telling him that she's her daughter. While initially disbelieving, he becomes convinced but remains uncaring after being urged by Charly to look at her eyes- which are identical to his. Timothy locks both up in an <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer,</b> leaving them to freeze to death, while taking Mitch away to be killed. Mitch tells Charly he'll be waiting to be rescued by her and Charly tells him that she'll be right there. Due to her ingenious thinking during her prior capture by Timothy, Charly blows up the freezer with help from Caitlin and escapes, saving Mitch just seconds before his death as he gets blown to safety into a tree.|$|R
50|$|Barry {{returned}} in August 1990 {{for the wedding}} of Terry and Sue. Terry and Sue allowed Barry to lodge in their house during this time. Whilst Barry had been away he had been running a series of illegal warehouse raves. This {{turned out to be}} a real money-spinner and he planned to do the same thing in Liverpool. Following a couple of successful warehouse raves in the city (and calling the police halfway through the night to generate publicity for the next one) Barry planned the biggest rave yet, which required financial backing which came in the form of two cockney brothers. Together they organised a big rave night which didn’t go according to plan when Barry discovered one of the brothers dealing drugs to kids in the toilets. Barry, never a fan of drugs, decided this meant the brothers should forfeit their share of the profits and made a quick escape with the bag full of notes. The brothers were soon on Barry's trail, and after seeing Barry with Sue and her little boy Danny, they assumed it was Barry’s son and so kidnapped him demanding the money back for his safe return. Barry successfully negotiated his release, but the brothers exacted further revenge by locking Barry in an <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer</b> on Christmas Day 1990. Barry made an ‘igloo’ out of frozen turkey boxes and was pulled out semi-conscious by Terry. After a few days in hospital Barry discharged himself, drove to London and planted a shotgun in one of the brothers cars before tipping off the police. Barry returned to Liverpool in high sprits to see in the new year.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, Mack Sexton was {{approached}} by Beatrice Foods with an offer to purchase the John Sexton & Co. Beatrice Foods was attracted to Sexton Quality Foods’ distribution network, quality, variety of private label products, specialized food offerings, sales force and profitability. Mack Sexton’s initial response was no, but Beatrice Foods was very interested. Eventually both parties reached an agreement. Beatrice Foods increased the purchase, pledged capital to expand Sexton Quality Foods distribution network, pledged capital to introduce a new Sexton frozen product line and pledged that the Sexton leadership would continue to lead and operate the company as a separate entity. On December 20, 1968, Beatrice Foods acquired the business and assets of John Sexton & Co., exchanging approximately 375,000 shares of Beatrice's preferred convertible preference stock valued at $37,500,000. John Sexton & Co. would become a separate independent division of Beatrice Foods still led by Mack Sexton (son of Franklin), William Egan (son of Helen) and William Sexton (son of Sherman). Mack became {{a vice president of}} Beatrice and a Beatrice board member. John Sexton & Co. put Beatrice Foods into the wholesale grocery business and Beatrice put John Sexton & Co. into the frozen foods business. Beatrice Foods and the Sexton leadership were interested in maximizing the investment in John Sexton & Co. by growing the company.In 1969, rather than proceeding with the original Sexton Quality Foods plan to acquire a frozen food manufacturer, Sexton tapped Beatrice Foods frozen foods expertise and capital to launch a Sexton frozen product line that included frozen meats, fruits, vegetables and ethnic entrees. Sexton Quality Foods new frozen line required the addition of <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer</b> storage to all 12-branch warehouses and retrofitting all delivery trucks with freezers. Over the next 4 years, six of the eight planned additional Sexton branch warehouses were opened in Hawaii, Indianapolis, Houston, Saint Louis, Seattle and Minneapolis.|$|R
40|$|The work {{consists}} of a design of an <b>industrial</b> <b>freezer</b> for Bastuträsk Charkuteri and the freezer should be built together with the existing plant in a good way. Dimensions have partially been measured by hand and some measures have also been read from old drawings of the factory. Based on these, drawings of the new building have been drawn partially by hand and partially by using Google SketchUp software and LayOut. Based on the literature associated with the project a suggestion {{for the construction of}} the foundation and the design of the freezer was developed in liaison with the supervisor. The freezer is built alongside the existing building, with a loading dock broadened out. The calculations for the load-bearing structure and the required power for the freezer have been done in Excel. Bearing structure is to be built in steel and the foundation shall be composed (from the ground up) of the base plate, double layer plastic foil vapour barrier, insulation and 10 - 15 cm concrete wearing slab. All the concrete layers need to be reinforced. The walls shall be built with freezer panels and the proposition is to use Sandwich panels from Ki-panel that have a width of 180 mm. They should have the coating on the inside in food grade polyester, 25 micrometres, and a coating of PVF 2 / PVDF for outdoor use on the outside. Suggested refrigerant for use is R 448 A in a four cylinder piston compressor 4 GE- 23 Y- 40 P from Bitzer in an indirect cooling system with subcritical carbon dioxide as a secondary refrigerant. The heat exchanger that is recommended to be used between the secondary and the primary refrigerant is TK 20 from Alfa Laval and the BR LCE 136 evaporator from Buffalo Trident is propositioned for the carbon dioxide inside the freezer. In this way, one can utilize the carbon dioxides good heat absorption and minimize the amount of the more climate negative R 448 A and still have good job security, since the suggested substances are neither flammable nor toxic.

50|$|The modern {{design of}} <b>industrial</b> ice cream <b>freezers</b> ensures {{a high level}} of machine/operator {{interface}} and top quality of the produced ice cream.The manufacturing process of ice cream production includes pasteurization, homogenization and maturation of the ice cream mixture. The prepared mixture enters into the industrial double tube scraped crystallizer - heat exchanger, in which the processes of pre-freezing and churning of ice cream are carried out. A refrigerant fluid evaporates and continually circulates in a vessel jacket.Usually, the initial temperature of an ice cream mixture is 12-18 °C. After switching on a freezer, an evaporating temperature of a refrigerant decreases down to a range from −25 to −32 °C. The final temperature of the treated mixture into the scraped surface freezer is about −5 °C, with an ice concentration of approximately 30-50%, depending on the formula. During the freezing process ice crystals form on the inside cool surface of the crystallizer wall. They are removed by blades, mixed into the bulk, and continue to decrease its temperature and to improve heat transfer within the product.|$|R
