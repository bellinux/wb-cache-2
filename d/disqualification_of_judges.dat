2500|$|In {{the case}} of Chee Siok Chin v.

The judge held there was no actual bias whatsoever justifying the recusal application. She further held that judges have to be careful not to accede too readily to suggestions of actual bias by litigants who do not want particular judges to hear their cases, as this would encourage parties to believe that by seeking the <b>disqualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> they would have their cases tried by other judges thought more likely to decide the cases in their favour.

40|$|The {{institution}} <b>of</b> <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>judge</b> is {{an important}} guarantee for the constitutional right to impartial court. However, when it is used for purposes contrary to its ratio legis, it harms the authority and good reputation of a judicial system. Instruments {{which can be used}} in the administrative court procedure to counteract abuse of the right of a party to motion <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>judge</b> have been provided for in the Act of 30 August 2002 on the Proceedings before Administrative Courts. They may also derive from judicial decisions. These instruments have been analysed with a view of establishing whether they are sufficient to prevent abuse of such right effectively. First, however, the institution <b>of</b> <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>judge</b> has been outlined. The Act of 9 April 2015 amending the Act on Proceedings before Administrative Courts introduced substantial amendments to the procedural instruments which been discussed separately as the instruments from before and after the date of their enforcement i. e. 5 August 2015. As the analysis showed, administrative courts have not elaborated uniform mechanisms of action in relation to a motion for <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>judge.</b> Consequently, not all actions help to speed up the proceeding. Moreover, a ﬁne for submitting a motion in bad faith available to an administrative court to apply to the entity submitting a motion in bad faith has been eliminated too hastily. On the other hand, the new regulations concerning a motion for <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> <b>of</b> court and resubmittal of the motion for <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>judge</b> have been assessed positively. 41249753 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R

40|$|Although {{the early}} history of the jurata shows it to have been chosen from among those who were {{familiar}} with the controversy and parties before the court, it has long been recognized that the better system attempts to obtain jurors and judges who have no prior knowledge of the dispute to be tried. In furtherance of this policy the voir dire exists to eliminate unwanted jurymen and similar devices have been established to provide for the <b>disqualification</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges.</b> In spite of these protections, the situation still occasionally arises where it is discovered after a trial has begun that the judge or a juryman is possessed of facts to which he should testify. When this occurs there is an immediate conflict between two tenets of the judicial system. It is a basic proposition that all relevant evidence should be presented to the trier of facts, while on the other hand the disinterestedness of the tribunal is essential to fairness. Unless this conflict is avoided by the granting of a mistrial and a recommencement of the action before a different judge or jury, there must be a compromise either with the principle of impartiality or a full disclosure. When the Model Code of Evidence and the more recent Uniform Rules of Evidence were formulated, this problem was considered and space given in the final drafts to its solution. It will be {{the purpose of this article}} to investigate these solutions, especially those of the Uniform Rules which resulted from further consideration of evidential problems, and to compare them with the present posture of the law...|$|E
50|$|The Act {{also created}} a Commissioner’s Court to be presided over by the {{commissioner}} of each municipality to deal with petty offenses for which the maximum punishment did not exceed $5. The law also defined the powers, qualifications, and <b>disqualifications</b> <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> and referees and specified the duties of court clerks, reporters, marshals, the attorney general, and the island attorney or prosecuting attorney. It provided requisites for admission {{to the practice of}} law and for a probation system.|$|R

40|$|Democratic states, {{regardless}} {{their legal}} system, pay utmost attention to creating guarantees ensuring a fair trial. In the US {{there is also}} a two-tier system providing for legal regulations at the federal as well as state level. In the presented discussion federal law is discussed as state law binding for one state only whilst the federal system is binding for the whole country. American regulations <b>of</b> the <b>judge</b> <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> are rooted in the Constitution of the United States. The Constitution is the most important source of federal law and supreme with respect to other legal acts. Apart from the US Constitution, the American federal law draws from the United States Code. Impartiality as one of the main attributes of the courts is considered particularly important in ensuring the right to the court. All other procedural afeguards and rules are rendered unimportant when a judge’s intent, prior to the proceeding, is to decide in a particular way. Therefore, other mechanisms are put in place in order to guarantee the right to due process. To those belongs <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> or recusal <b>of</b> <b>judge.</b> Civil and common law systems have permeated each other and it was interesting to investigate this measure outside of the civil law system. The American legal system turned out particularly worthy a note. This article analyses judge disqualiﬁcation as a due process safeguard in the American legal system. The research into federal law, commentaries and the US Supreme Court’s decisions have allowed to characterise federal <b>disqualiﬁcation</b> <b>of</b> <b>judge.</b> The results presented in this article include the core conclusions on impartiality and disqualiﬁcation within the American legal system. Additionally, they contain the impartiality principle construal and explain its role for the state and justice. 41277944 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|R
25|$|The Montana Supreme Court {{has twice}} had {{occasion}} to rule on administrative issues facing District Courts. In , the issue was the substitution and <b>disqualification</b> <b>of</b> District Court <b>judges.</b> If a District Court has not published rules regarding substitution and disqualification, the high court said, then Montana Supreme Court rules regarding the same hold sway. In , the issue was whether a District Court could continue to operate even though its budget {{for the fiscal year}} had ended. Here, the Supreme Court said that District Courts had the authority to order the state to pay reasonable and necessary expenses.|$|R
25|$|Bias {{arising out}} of a non-pecuniary {{interest}} can, like a pecuniary interest, result in the automatic <b>disqualification</b> <b>of</b> a <b>judge</b> from hearing a case. In R. v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 2) (1999), the issue was whether Lord Hoffmann {{should be regarded as}} automatically disqualified from hearing an appeal by Augusto Pinochet against his extradition to Spain to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Lord Hoffmann was the Director and Chairperson of Amnesty International Charity Ltd., a company undertaking the aspects of the work of Amnesty International Ltd. which are charitable under UK law. He had no pecuniary interest in the company as he was neither employed nor paid by it, but had carried out fund-raising for it. Amnesty International Ltd. was a party to the case against Pinochet. The House of Lords decided the issue in the affirmative, stating that as the fundamental principle is that a man cannot be a judge in his own cause, there is no good reason in principle for limiting automatic disqualification only to pecuniary interests.|$|R
50|$|One {{day later}} Vincente Petroscgalia cross {{examines}} Dr. Stefanoni, asking {{her about the}} hundreds of test results she did not provide to the defense, even though the court had ordered her to do so. The prosecutor interrupts, and after a heated argument the judge decides that the matter {{is not allowed to}} be discussed, which provokes the defense attorney to request a judicial <b>disqualification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>judge</b> for bias. Nencini rejects the request. In the following, brutal questioning of Stefanoni, Petroscaglia is able to prove by confronting the witness with photos and police illustrations that the attribution of singular shoe and footprints to the defendants made by her office, were intentionally wrong, and that Stefanoni had testified falsely about it before. By using a formerly hidden report from her own lab, the defense is able to show, that Stefanoni lied under oath about Knox having left her footprints in the victim’s blood, knowing that the footprints were left from showering as early as in 2007. An attempt to break the witness to confess the truth fails, when prosecutor Collodi intervenes.The last witnesses are Amanda Knox herself and Raffaele Sollecito who both vividly and shockingly describe, in a scene based on word by word translations of earlier court transcripts, how they were set under pressure and manipulated during the infamous interrogation night from 5th to 6 November 2007.|$|R

40|$|In Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co., the U. S. Supreme Court vacated a {{state supreme}} court {{decision}} in which a justice who had received 3 million in campaign support from a litigant cast the deciding vote to relieve the litigant of a 50 million liability. The Court reached this result, one I view as compelled by common sense, through a 5 - 4 vote, with the dissenters, led by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia, minimizing the danger <b>of</b> biased <b>judging</b> presented by the situation and questioning the practical feasibility of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s approach {{as well as the}} wisdom of expanding review of state court judicial disqualification pursuant to the Due Process Clause. Although its critics see Caperton as an unwise intrusion into state elections and state disqualification practice, Caperton 2 ̆ 7 s biggest problem is that it did not go far enough and make due process congruent with prevailing state and federal disqualification standards. By crafting an “serious risk of actual bias” test for due process-based constitutional disqualification that differs (albeit perhaps not greatly) from the well-established general approach to <b>disqualification</b> <b>of</b> a <b>judge</b> when his or her impartiality may be reasonably questioned, the Court has been unduly tentative and confusing in setting the parameters of judicial impartiality. The Court should recognize that any error in failing to recuse deprives the affected litigant of a fundamental constitutional right [...] the right to have the case heard by a neutral adjudicator. Consequently, any erroneous rejection of a request to recuse is at least technically one of constitutional dimension that should be potentially subject to U. S. Supreme Court review and correction. However, the Court need not become mired in the flood <b>of</b> <b>disqualification</b> cases predicted by the dissenting justices in Caperton. Insistence upon review <b>of</b> <b>disqualification</b> decisions by a neutral body <b>of</b> <b>judges</b> can be used to ensure that litigants receive sufficient procedural due process. The constitutional question surrounding judicial recusal is primarily one of procedural due process. If states put in place adequate procedures for deciding and reviewing disqualification motions, few Caperton-like situations compelling high court intervention are likely to ensue. Where erroneous recusal decisions occur in spite of such safeguards, U. S. Supreme Court review should be at least potentially available as necessary to vindicate the strong constitutional interest in neutral courts and fair adjudication, an interest sounding in substantive due process. The Court need exercise this potential power only in relatively egregious cases, thereby promoting judicial economy while nonetheless discouraging disqualification abuses...|$|R
