Whilst his criticism was perhaps unjustified in the second test, it certainly wasn’t here. England did appear to have given up during day 2, and this possibly acted {{as a catalyst for}} the poor batting performance that followed.|$|E

25|$|In a video titled “The Truth About the West Bank” {{released}} by the Israeli foreign ministry in June 2011, Ayalon presents a historical narrative meant to help wage the public diplomacy battle about Israel’s ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. In the video made in cooperation with StandWithUs, which {{is very similar to}} one released earlier by the Yesha council, the organization of the Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Ayalon asks viewers to stop referring to the West Bank as “occupied territories”. “It is time for Israel to return to a ‘rights-based diplomacy’ and talk about the facts, rights, history and international law which are little known but give a dramatically different viewpoint to what is currently accepted,” <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> the video’s release. After the video was posted online, Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian Authority’s top negotiator, denounced the video as a “falsified account of history and international law”, but refused to participate in a public debate on the issues raised in the video proposed by Ayalon.|$|E

500|$|Alaphilippe's second-place finish was {{the best}} for any French rider since Laurent Jalabert in 1998. He had entered the race in support of Kwiatkowski. When Kwiatkowski was {{struggling}} on the Côte de Saint-Nicolas, the Etixx-Quick Step directeur sportif sent a radio message to Alaphilippe to ride for himself; this {{was similar to the}} events in La Flèche Wallonne, where Alaphilippe also finished second to Valverde. He was frustrated on the finish line and waved his arm in the air; <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> the race [...] "today I really felt I could have done something more".

500|$|Pujols began 2008 by {{reaching}} base in 42 straight games, the longest streak {{to open a}} season since Derek Jeter reached base in the first 53 games of 1999.

500|$|Aru {{said after}} the stage {{that he had been}} able to tell that Dumoulin was tired. He paid {{particular}} credit to his teammates who had encouraged him to attack from a long way out.

500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, recalling {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's. We'd almost finished making the film, and this fun bit arrived that we'd not known about before, which was naming the film. So we were sitting around at Twickenham studios having a little brain-storming session ... and we said, 'Well, there was something Ringo said the other day.' Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic even though he was just getting it wrong.

500|$|Kwiatkowski's {{victory was}} his first since joining Team Sky at the {{beginning}} of 2016. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> the race that his main target was still the Ardennes classics rather than the remainder of the cobbled classics season, but that there was no reason why he could not succeed in both. He pointed out that he was glad to have escaped with Sagan as they worked well together – they had arrived at the finish of the 2014 Strade Bianche in a similar situation, with Kwiatkowski the winner there as well. He said that he thought he had surprised Sagan by sprinting first, rather than waiting for Sagan's sprint. He also acknowledged that he knew from his own experience a year before that it was [...] "very difficult" [...] to race with the pressure of the world champion's rainbow jersey.|$|E
500|$|During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles {{tried to}} work out a new contract.

I just felt like the Orioles were playing mind games with me. Whether that was right or wrong, it was bothering me." [...] On August 22, Ripken finally signed a five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the time. Ripken's slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles' fans late in the season. He finished the year batting [...]251 with career-lows in home runs (14) and RBI (72). The Orioles contended for the playoffs much of the year, not getting eliminated until September 27. However, he did win his second Gold Glove Award.|$|E

[...] Before surrendering a home run to David Ortiz, Wacha tied Gibson with the longest scoreless streak (19 innings) in Cardinals' postseason history. [...] Wacha became the 17th-youngest pitcher overall to win a World Series game and the second-youngest in Cardinals history behind only Paul Dean. [...] In Game 6, with the Cardinals facing elimination once more, Wacha was again called upon to save their season after winning four consecutive playoff starts with a 1.00 ERA and just 11 hits allowed in 27 innings for a [...]122 opponents' batting average.

500|$|By {{this stage}} of the war, Japanese {{aircraft}} were almost non-existent in the South West Pacific theatre; No.78 Squadron's main role was ground attack, bombing and strafing enemy positions. Waters flew 95sorties from Noemfoor, and later from the air bases at Morotai and Tarakan, in Borneo. During one mission, his aircraft was struck by a 37mm cannon shell that embedded itself behind him in the cockpit without detonating. He flew for another two hours, with the possibility of the shell exploding at any time, a situation he likened to having a loaded gun against his head. [...] "I'll tell you what", <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> returning to base, [...] "that was the best landing I ever made". On 1January 1945, he was promoted to flight sergeant. By the end of the war, Waters was commanding operations which included commissioned officers. A colleague described him as a [...] "gaunt, genial figure, humble despite his daring feats". In addition to his combat flying, Waters also held the RAAF middleweight boxing title.|$|E
500|$|The squad {{was one of}} {{the first}} to start the stage 1 team time trial. Viganò crashed at one point and {{finished}} almost three minutes behind his teammates, but the squad still managed to put up the day's winning time, finishing with the necessary five riders together four seconds the better of defending Vuelta champion Vincenzo Nibali's [...] squad. Fuglsang was the rider who crossed the line first, making him the first wearer of the race leader's red jersey. <b>He</b> <b>said</b> <b>after</b> the stage that the team had not pre-determined who would cross the line first, as is customarily the case in advance of a team time trial. It had simply been Fuglsang's turn to ride on the front when the finish line came. He said would try to ride for the overall classification, with Bennati and Cancellara to hunt for stage wins in the sprints and individual time trial, respectively. Bennati contested the sprint finish the next day, taking sixth behind Christopher Sutton. Since Fuglsang also finished at the front of the race, combined stage finishes meant that Bennati would take the red jersey for stage 3. Solo stage winner Pablo Lastras claimed the jersey the next day, but Fuglsang and Monfort continued to be well-placed in the overall standings.|$|E
