5000|$|Any form of {{sporting}} interest with {{appeal to a}} Yorkshireman promptly engenders demand for a match with Lancashire. Before Rugby football had even acquired commonly acceptable laws or pattern of play Yorkshire and Lancashire were eager to {{compete with each other}} and from this eagerness grew, in course of time and through disharmonious days, the Rugby Football Unions of Yorkshire and Lancashire.A Yorkshireman, J. G. Hudson, was innovator; not of the Yorkshire Rugby Union, but of matches with Lancashire, which originated county Rugby, thereby demanding the creation of county authorities.Hudson was a founder of the Leeds Athletic Club which was built on the simple basis of a newspaper invitation to play football on Woodhouse Moor [...] "from 7 to 8 o'clock a.m.".The Victorian virtue of early rising brought extension of playing hours; morning football came to start at 6.30 a.m.-presumably when daylight permitted-and either the power of the Press or the inherent fascination of the new pastime induced attendances of 500, participants in practice games numbering 60 to 150, all, apparently, served by one ball and goalposts consisting of broom handles identified by fluttering cotton.These practices on Woodhouse Moor were not conducted entirely for their own sake. There were other Northern nurseries of the same, or a similar, game and in 1864 matches were played against Sheffield. Winds of challenge blew across the Pennines; in 1865 Leeds played Manchester.This, of course, was not enough. Yorkshire had to meet Lancashire and at Hudson's instigation they did, so instituting county history in Rugby football.The first Yorkshire authority and the first Yorkshire team were representative of the county only in their representation of Leeds, Bradford, Huddersfield and Hull and no formal committee was required because no formal business had to be transacted.Match management was by venue, Leeds, Bradford, and Huddersfield finding the grounds and choosing the teams for home matches and Hull undertaking responsibility for away fixtures.The Northern counties are prideful communities and Rugby football quickly extended county pride and loyalties. Yorkshire's founding fathers, spurred by Harry Wharfedale Tennant Garnett of Bradford, wanted county matches to become occasions offering hospitality off the field as well as a contest in sport and to this <b>end</b> <b>preparation</b> was necessary.By 1874 the representatives of Leeds Athletic, Bradford, Huddersfield, Hull and York were meeting as a committee to promote county interests.They were a self-created authority, serving a current need and they sought to be no more than the machinery of a county club as distinct from a union of represented clubs within a geographical and administrative area.The committee of the five held county reins through a period of accumulating discontent as the Rugby game spread and the number of clubs increased. They were challenged in 1880 and, with no great show of enthusiasm, invited two other clubs to join them.They bent further before the wind in 1883 when they proposed a revised constitution, but dismissed a request for county organisation under elected members from Yorkshire clubs within the now established national Rugby Union.They conceded the inevitable in 1888 when the Yorkshire County Club formally became the Yorkshire Rugby Union.|$|E

40|$|På uppdrag av CWR Engineering AB har en undersökning utförts över huruvida det är möjligt att skapa ett verktyg som kan hjälpa den mekaniska konstruktören inom processindustrin att höja kvalitetssäkringen och effektiviteten i sitt arbete med utrustningsritningar. Arbetet i utvecklingsprocessen i processindustrin strävar mot en tvärfunktionalitet. All konstruktion grundas i Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) där processen för exempelvis en kemikaliefabrik beskrivs i 2 D-format med rörledningar, utrustningar och {{instrument}} specificerat till sort, men inte position. Dessa utrustningar ska sedan beskrivas detaljerat i en 2 D-ritning. 2 D-ritningen är i sin tur underlag för modellering av utrustningen i 3 D. Till sist placeras 3 D-modellen ut i fabrikslayouten i en 3 D-miljö. Fabrikslayouten är i sin tur också styrd av P&IDschemat. En utrustningsritning skiljer sig från en vanlig mekanisk ritning så till vida att den inte har någon standard för vyplacering, så som en mekanisk ritning kan ha en europeisk eller amerikansk vyplacering. Utrustningsritningen ska uppfylla krav för att positionsbestämma och definiera alla komponenter, vilket kan göras på olika sätt. Upplägget för dessa ritningar skapar risk för fel, vilket det framtagna verktyget skall bygga bort. I detta arbete avgränsades studien till tankar med dess studsar. Arbetet har resulterat i ett layoutkoncept för en applikation i konstruktörens datamiljö vilken skapar en inbyggd felsäkring i arbetsprocessen samt effektiviserar arbetet i och med enklare arbetsprocess. Konceptet har arbetats fram genom analys av arbetsprocessen och de programvaror konstruktören använder i sitt arbete. Ett flöde för den tekniska hanteringen har identifierats och utifrån dessa data har konceptframtagningen genomförts. Layoutkonceptet består av tre delar. Ett ritningsfilhanteringsformulär vilket skapar, raderar, reviderar och korrelerar statusen för alla utrustningar i P&ID. All information om dessa scheman lagras i en Microsoft SQL serverdatabas och kan med hjälp av Microsoft Visual Studio användas för att skapa, styra och kontrollera utrustningsritningarna, vilka ritas i 2 D-CADprogrammet SmartSketch. I SmartSketch arbetar konstruktören i dagsläget med symboler, vilka är färdigritade statiska komponenter konstruktören kan positionera ut på ritningen och sedan ändra storlekens i olika skalor. Dessa finns i olika typer beroende på studstyp. Andra delen av konceptet består av att göra dessa symboler dynamiska och drivna parametriskt via en byggmåttsdatabas. Information om studsens storlek, måttstandard, tryckklass, typ av ände kommer från P&IDdatan, vilken sedan hämtar information om byggmått i en databas till symbolen och symbolen får sedan rätt storlek och kan placeras ut på tanken. Symbolmängden kan därför dras ner då symbolens grafik ändras parametriskt. Om någon faktor för studsen skulle komma att ändras uppdateras då symbolen automatiskt. Konstruktören kan också manuellt ändra variabler så som storlek eller tryckklass även innan ändringen hunnit ske i P&ID, som en del i tvärfunktionaliteten. Den tredje huvudfunktionaliteten för konceptet är granskning av ritningen genom data över positionering, vyöverensstämmelse och identiteter för studsarna. Granskningen rapporteras i en PDF-fil och i ett dialogfönster. On {{behalf of}} CWR Engineering AB a development project has taken place. The {{goal of the}} project was {{to determine whether or not}} it is possible to create an application which can make working process of the mechanical engineer, in the process industry, run with higher quality assurance and efficiency whilst creating equipment drawings. The development process within process industry strives towards being cross- functional. All design is based on the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID), where the process, for example a chemical plant, described in 2 D where the piping, equipment and instruments are specified to type, but not position. The equipment is then described in detail in a 2 D drawing. The 2 D drawing in turn is the basis for the equipment when creating it in 3 D. Finally, the 3 D model is placed into the factory layout in a 3 D environment. The factory layout correspond to the design determined in the P&ID. An equipment drawing differs from a standard mechanical drawing in the sense that it has no standard for its views, such as a mechanical drawing can be designed by either a European or an American standard. The equipment drawing must however still meet the requirements of defining all components described within the P&ID, which can be done in some different ways. The format for these drawings creates possibilities for error, which the developed application is to prevent. In this project, the study was limited to tanks with its nozzles. The project has resulted in a layout concept for an application in the engineer's computer environment which creates a built-in error-proofing in the working process. It makes the process more efficient. The concept has been developed through analyzing the working process used today and the software the engineer uses in his work. A flow for the technical information have been identified and based on these data, the concept has been developed. The layout concept consists of three parts. First, a drawing file management form which creates, deletes, revises and correlate the status of all equipment drawings to the data in P&ID. All data from these diagrams are stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database. Using Microsoft Visual Studio this data can be used to create, manage and control the equipment drawings in a semi-automated way. The drawings are created in 2 D CAD software SmartSketch. The SmartSketch user is currently using symbols, which are pre-drawn static components which the user can place on the drawing and then scale to preferred size. These symbols are available in various executions depending on the nozzle to be placed. The second part of the concept consists of making these symbols dynamic and driven parametrically through a dimensions database. Information about the standpipe size, dimensions standard, pressure rating and <b>end</b> <b>preparation</b> comes from the P&ID data, which then retrieves information about parametric dimensions in a database. The symbol automatically receives correct dimensions and can be placed on the tank. The amount of symbols can therefore be reduced since the symbol's graphic changes parametrically. If any variable of the nozzle is be changed, the symbol will automatically be updated. The user can also manually change variables such as size and pressure class, even before the changes take place in the P&ID, as a part of cross- functionality. The third main functionality of the concept is the examination of the drawing data pertaining to the positioning and view conformity of the nozzles. The examination result is to be reported in a PDF file and in a dialog window...|$|E
