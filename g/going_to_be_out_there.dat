500|$|In March 2013, {{researchers}} {{published the}} DNA {{sequence of the}} genome of a strain of HeLa cells. The Lacks family discovered this when the author Rebecca Skloot informed them. There were objections from the Lacks family about the genetic information that was available for public access. [...] Jeri Lacks Whye, a grandchild of Henrietta Lacks, said to The New York Times, [...] "the biggest concern was privacy - what information was actually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> about our grandmother, and what information they can obtain from her sequencing that will tell them about her children and grandchildren and going down the line". [...] That same year another group working on a different HeLa cell line's genome under NIH funding submitted it for publication. In August 2013, an agreement was announced between {{the family and the}} National Institutes of Health that gave the family some control over access to the cells' DNA sequence found in the two studies along with a promise of acknowledgement in scientific papers. In addition, two family members will join the six-member committee which will regulate access to the sequence data.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{gun control}} laws which he views {{as a form}} of {{government}} tyranny: [...] "What {{people all over the country}} fear today is being abandoned by their government. If a tornado hits, if a hurricane hits, if a riot occurs, that they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> alone, and the only way they will protect themselves, in the cold, in the dark, when they are vulnerable, is with a firearm." [...] There are some laws, however, he supports, such as the ban on gun sales to, or possession by, convicted felons or those adjudicated as incompetent or mentally ill.|$|E
5000|$|Oh, that's easy, the optimists. Oh, {{they were}} the ones who said, 'We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> by Christmas.' And Christmas would come, and Christmas would go.

She said, [...] "Sometimes, you have to disassociate how you feel personally {{about the prospect of}} going into war and, you know, possibly see the death that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> But personally, as an aviator and a soldier, this is the moment that everybody trains for -- that I've trained for -- so I feel ready to meet a challenge." ...|$|E
5000|$|After the Colts routed the Denver Broncos in the wild-card {{round of}} the 2004 playoffs, he told reporters that the Colts' opponents in the next {{round of the}} playoffs, the Patriots, were [...] "ripe for the picking," [...] and said [...] "I think they're not as good as the {{beginning}} of the year and not as good as last year" [...] (when they won the Super Bowl). Patriots safety Rodney Harrison fired back at him in an interview, calling him [...] "Vanderjerk". Harrison's teammate, linebacker Willie McGinest, was more temperate in his response, but noted that [...] "there's going to be a whole bunch of plays when he's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> the field. The rest of his guys will be out there dealing with it." [...] The Patriots eventually defeated the Colts 20-3 and went on to win Super Bowl XXXIX.|$|E

5000|$|... "The great {{majority}} of protests across the country Wednesday passed off peacefully… The police let the demonstrators march through town centres and take part in some direct action. However, {{the actions of the}} Metropolitan Police yesterday were absolutely outrageous. It's a real scandal that the Met has taken these actions and we would urge them to change their tactics for further demonstrations." [...] Simon Hardy, of the National Campaign Against Fees and Cuts During the Whitehall incident, the Metropolitan Police publicly defended their use of kettling, with Chief Inspector Jane Connors claiming that they had only used it as [...] "a last resort". She stated: [...] "it's a valid tactic. Police officers came under attack and we needed to make sure the violence didn't spread out across the London streets." [...] The police came under increasing criticism however, particularly as there were large numbers of children and young teenagers in the crowd, who were held for nearly ten hours in near-zero temperatures. Green Party MP Caroline Lucas brought up the topic in the House of Commons that afternoon, stating: [...] "there are many hundreds of students and school children who have been kettled for over four hours and are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> for another several hours, according to the police, in the freezing cold… whatever one thinks of the student protest, people against their will in the contained crowd was neither proportionate, nor, indeed, effective." ...|$|E
5000|$|The International Association of Fire Fighters {{issued a}} letter in 2007, accusing Giuliani of [...] "egregious acts" [...] against the 343 firemen {{who had died in}} the September 11th attacks. The letter {{asserted}} that Giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from World Trade Center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered: [...] "Mayor Giuliani's actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at Ground Zero forever, with no closure for families, or be removed like garbage and deposited at the Fresh Kills Landfill." [...] The Giuliani campaign stated that the union was politically motivated from tough contract negotiations from Giuliani's second term as mayor and quoted a retired firefighter, Lee Ielphi (a father of 9-11 victim who was called to duty as a firefighter that day), saying [...] "Firefighters have no greater friend and supporter than Rudy Giuliani." [...] The union denied political motivation for the criticism. Jim Riches, an official at a firefighters' union and the father of a fallen Ground Zero firefighter, said, [...] "We have all the UFA, the UFOA, and the fire members are all behind us -- the International Association of Fire Fighters.... And we’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> today to let everybody know that he’s not the hero that he says he is." [...] The unions' complaints focus on the malfunctioning radios used by the fire department on September 11, 2001 and what they claim was a lack of coordination at the Ground Zero site.|$|E
