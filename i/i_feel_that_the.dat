25|$|Shooting 'Put It in a Love Song' in Rio, in Brazil, {{was very}} incredible, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{energy of the}} city matches {{the energy of the}} song. It's sensual, it's exciting, it's so rich with color. I loved it. The people came out so heavy and so hard. I think it was exciting, {{especially}} to participate and experience it with them like that. Me and B have a good relationship. And {{to be able to have}} the chemistry we have and do it in a city that's so unique like that is unforgettable. The pictures speak a thousand words. So you saw the energy out there. It was great.|$|E
500|$|The {{new concept}} for Pokémon Colosseum was {{influenced}} by RPGs such as Final Fantasy VII and Persona 2 over the Pokémon mold. When asked {{in an interview with}} Prima Games why the gameplay of Colosseum did not mirror that of the handheld Pokémon games, Pokémon director Junichi Masuda explained: [...] "How players communicate with each other has been key to the Pokémon games – it is the backbone of all Pokémon game designs. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> handheld systems work better than the home-based consoles. It's certainly possible to come up with concepts for home-based consoles, but we might then have to change the core of the game." ...|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{completed}} his paratrooper training {{in just over}} eight months, and Major General C.W.G. Rich awarded him the prestigious Screaming Eagles patch on January 11, 1962. By February, his personal conduct had begun to draw criticism from his superiors. They labeled him an unqualified marksman and often caught him napping while on duty and failing to report for bed checks. On May 24, Hendrix's platoon sergeant, James C. Spears, filed a report in which he stated: [...] "He has no interest whatsoever in the Army... It is my opinion that Private Hendrix will never {{come up to the}} standards required of a soldier. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> military service will benefit if he is discharged as soon as possible." [...] On June 29, 1962, Captain Gilbert Batchman granted Hendrix an honorable discharge on the basis of unsuitability. Hendrix later spoke of his dislike of the army and falsely stated that he had received a medical discharge after breaking his ankle during his 26th parachute jump.|$|E

500|$|On 16 October 2009, Wilders {{arrived in}} the United Kingdom and was quickly forced to move his press conference due to protests by about forty members of the {{organization}} Islam4UK, an organization that was later shut down under the UK's Terrorism Act 2000 on 14 January 2010. Though the Home Office had asserted that his entry into the country would not be blocked, a spokesman said his [...] "statements and behaviour during a visit will inevitably impact on any future decisions to admit him." [...] His visit to the UK met with protest, but Wilders called it [...] "a victory" [...] in a press conference. On his outspoken views on Islam, he said: [...] "I {{have a problem with the}} Islamic ideology, the Islamic culture, because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> more Islam that we get in our societies the less freedom we get." [...] He opened the press conference with a quote from George Orwell's preface to Animal Farm: [...] "If liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they don't want to hear". Lord Pearson, who had invited him, said his arrival was [...] "a celebration of the victory of freedom of speech over those who would prevent it in this country, particularly the Islamists, the violent Jihadists who are on the march across the world and in the UK." ...|$|E
2500|$|But {{the mystery}} of the village green also offers an eternity that belittles {{problems}} such as public embarrassment ("All of My Friends Were There"), because [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> world is too much for me I think of the Big Sky, and nothing matters much to me". Elsewhere, he is [...] "Spreading my arms to the open wide. Now I am free... I can close my eyes", and [...] "the sky is wide" [...] – of which last Davies has said; [...] "to me, the whole record is the way I sing that line.".|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} on {{his decision to}} play hockey at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino, Fedorov said, [...] "I don't think {{it is appropriate to}} delay my decision about the Olympics any further. As much as I would enjoy representing my country in Italy, I'm afraid that {{at this point in the}} season my focus has to remain with the Columbus Blue Jackets... <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> most important thing is for me to continue to work towards being 100 percent healthy. My main priority and responsibility is to the Columbus Blue Jackets and I don't believe participating in the Olympics, which is a short, intense tournament, would be the best thing to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} likes me too," [...] said Branwen, thoughtfully. [...] "Besides, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Boong-jee-gop has some {{influence}} over him. Yes, I {{think we are}} safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But he didn't. From his manner, {{and from}} {{a word or two}} <b>that</b> he spoke, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> paper has been placed where it is by other hands." ...|$|R

2500|$|Within the Government doubts quickly {{began to}} be voiced about the justice of his treatment. [...] Even his Secretary of State and the Prime Minister in 1936, Baldwin, wrote letters admitting that their {{decision}} had been wrong. As former Prime Minister, Sir Stanley Baldwin later wrote [...] "I feel it only right to say that, if I had had the full evidence before me which has now been made available, I should not have taken the decision I reluctantly did". Writing in November 1937, Lord Hankey stated [...] "the more I think about it the more <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> punishment did not fit the crime". In December 1938, the Marquess of Londonderry – the Secretary of State for Air {{at the time of}} the dismissal – wrote privately to Baldwin [...] "... was most unjustly treated and was the victim of the inveterate hatred of a civil servant Sir Warren Fisher who should never have been allowed to encompass his downfall, as he undoubtedly did." ...|$|E
2500|$|The demonstrations raised {{questions}} for Harvard students {{about their own}} role in the nation's economic elite—the so-called [...] "1%". Even participants struggled {{with the question of}} how Harvard students could authentically express solidarity with the downtrodden of the world. Students deliberated over the effects of Harvard's comprehensive financial aid policies. Neal Gabler wrote in the New York Times that Harvard students were [...] "superachivers", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were [...] "likely to be wealthy, well-appointed young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers." [...] One Harvard graduate who had already joined Occupy Boston told the Boston Globe that attending Harvard did not ensure membership in the 1%, saying: [...] "I’m the first person in my family to go to college, and I worked hard to go to Harvard, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> way the country is now, the American dream isn’t possible.’" [...] Some students in a dormitory near the encampment responded directly, chanting [...] "We are the one percent" [...] and yelling insults.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1932 Franklin Delano Roosevelt {{was elected}} President and {{proposed}} his New Deal. Many, including Gray, saw {{this and other}} programs as government interference in private enterprise. Gray railed against Roosevelt and his programs. (Gray even killed Daddy Warbucks off in 1945, believing that Warbucks could not coexist {{in the world with}} FDR. But following FDR's death, Gary resurrected Warbucks, who said to Annie, [...] "Somehow <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> climate here has changed since I went away.") Annie's life was complicated not only by thugs and gangsters but also by New Deal do-gooders and bureaucrats. Organized labor was feared by businessmen and Gray took their side. Some writers and editors took issue with this strip's criticisms of FDR's New Deal and 1930s labor unionism. The New Republic described Annie as [...] "Hooverism in the Funnies", arguing that Gray's strip was defending utility company bosses then being investigated by the government. The Herald Dispatch of Huntington, West Virginia stopped running Little Orphan Annie, printing a front page editorial rebuking Gray's politics. A subsequent New Republic editorial praised the paper's move, and The Nation likewise voiced its support.|$|E
6000|$|Answer. Not at all. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> certain <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{scene of}} the novel having edged itself around to London, the writer will not feel {{satisfied}} unless he introduces the following famous scene: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I," [...] he answered, cheerfully, [...] "am afraid {{no longer}} of anything. I {{have become a}} raving optimist. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> if <b>the</b> war comes we shall sweep the Turks {{from the face of}} the earth." ...|$|R

2500|$|Theo {{referred}} to these pictorial {{elements in a}} letter to Vincent dated 22 October 1889: [...] "I clearly sense what preoccupies you in the new canvases like the village in the moonlight [...] or the mountains, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> search for style takes away the real sentiment of things." [...] Vincent responded in early November, [...] "Despite what you say in your previous letter, that the search for style often harms other qualities, the fact is that I feel myself greatly driven to seek style, if you like, but I mean by that a more manly and more deliberate drawing. If that will make me more like Bernard or Gauguin, I can't do anything about it. But am inclined to believe {{that in the long run}} you'd get used to it." [...] And later in the same letter, he wrote, [...] "I know very well that the studies drawn with long, sinuous lines from the last consignment weren't what they ought to become, however I dare urge you to believe that in landscapes one will continue to mass things by means of a drawing style that seeks to express the entanglement of the masses." ...|$|E

60|$|I {{have already}} {{in some measure}} given {{the reasons for this}} change;[47] but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that,</b> for <b>the</b> sake of those among my {{scholars}} who have laboriously learned the accepted names, I ought now also to explain its method more completely.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, mother, I do {{not think}} that I was wrong. <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> real fault in all this is with Mr. Trevelyan, as it has been all through. He should not have written to her as he has done." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Think what England would be!" [...] {{said the}} Captain.
