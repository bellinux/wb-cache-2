5|$|Anime cutscenes are {{included}} in each game, and are a primary focus for the production team as they <b>help</b> <b>make</b> the first impression on players. The series aims to avoid standard anime tropes and common narrative elements with each installment. The first game to feature such cutscenes was Destiny. The cutscenes were animated by Production I.G, which has provided cutscenes for the series until Xillia. For Xillia, aiming to demonstrate a new artistic direction for the series, production of the anime cutscenes was given to Ufotable. For the Nintendo DS release of Hearts, two identical versions of the game were released as an experiment by the production team, with one featuring traditional anime animation by Production I.G., and one featuring computer-generated cutscenes by Shirogumi Ltd. The CGI cutscenes proved less popular with fans than the established anime style.|$|E

5|$|For the 2007–08 season, the Avalanche signed {{two free}} agents: defenseman Scott Hannan and left winger Ryan Smyth. These {{acquisitions}} filled the team's needs and {{were expected to}} <b>help</b> <b>make</b> an impact in the playoffs. With a 9–5 victory over the St. Louis Blues on December 9, 2007, the Avalanche earned their 1,000th franchise victory. On February 25, 2008, unrestricted free agent Peter Forsberg signed with the Avalanche {{for the remainder of}} the 2007–08 season. A day later, at the trade deadline, they re-acquired popular defenseman Adam Foote from the Columbus Blue Jackets as well as Ruslan Salei from the Florida Panthers. In the Western Conference Quarter-finals, Colorado beat the Minnesota Wild in six games. In the Western Conference Semi-finals, however, the Avalanche were swept by the eventual Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|In May 1997, {{two groups}} of six female sailors were posted to Collins and Farncomb to test the {{feasibility}} of mixed-sex submarine companies. Following the trial's success, eleven female sailors and one female officer commenced submarine training in 1998. Officers and senior enlisted submariners slept in mixed accommodation, but junior enlisted submariners could only be deployed in groups of six: one of the enlisted cabins was set aside, and all six bunks in the cabin had to be filled. Mixed accommodation for all female submariners was approved in June 2011, {{in order to increase}} posting opportunities and <b>help</b> <b>make</b> up shortfalls in submarine complements.|$|E
5|$|Kirkland cites his {{assistant}} director Matthew Nastuk {{as a big}} influence on the episode. He became heavily involved with the animation because {{he had grown up}} in New Jersey, where the Thomas Edison National Historical Park that Homer and Bart visit is located. To <b>help</b> <b>make</b> the museum look as authentic as possible, Kirkland and Nastuk visited it and took a large number of photographs that they brought back to the animation studio. At one point in the episode, Homer writes complex math formulas on a chalkboard. The producers wanted them to be actual formulas, so writer David X. Cohen got in contact with a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who were able to provide them.|$|E

5|$|Many popular novels were {{published}} about the mounted police from 1885 onwards, {{and in the}} 20th century over 250 films were made, along with radio and television portrayals. The police were depicted as courageous, disciplined and chivalrous, displaying a sense of fair-play as they brought their suspects to justice. Historians, working from initially limited public records and chronicles, wrote similarly eulogistic accounts of the mounted police, but as new archives became available in the 1970s, more critical and analytic accounts of the force were produced. The force heavily influenced public perceptions of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, which used the North-West Mounted Police's image and history to <b>help</b> <b>make</b> the modern police a popular Canadian national symbol.|$|E
5|$|Offa's {{diplomatic}} relations with Europe are well documented, but appear to belong only to the last dozen years of his reign. In letters dating from the late 780s or early 790s, Alcuin congratulates Offa for encouraging education and greets Offa's wife and son, Cynethryth and Ecgfrith. In about 789, or shortly before, Charlemagne proposed that his son Charles marry one of Offa's daughters, most likely Ælfflæd. Offa countered with a request that his son Ecgfrith should also marry Charlemagne's daughter Bertha: Charlemagne was outraged by the request, and broke off contact with Britain, forbidding English ships from landing in his ports. Alcuin's letters {{make it clear that}} by the end of 790 the dispute was still not resolved, and that Alcuin was hoping to be sent to <b>help</b> <b>make</b> peace. In the end {{diplomatic relations}} were restored, at least partly by the agency of Gervold, the abbot of St Wandrille.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 2012, NYSDOT {{announced}} {{a project to}} reconstruct NY149 and its junction with US4 in Fort Ann. The project would upgrade the intersection by doing an overall expansion, requiring the condemnation of one property. This new widening would <b>help</b> <b>make</b> turns from US4 south to NY149 west. The intersection would be repaved and drainage basins on US4 and NY149, which would tie into the system on Clay Hill Road. NYSDOT's website notes that announced that bids of the new project were announced in Fall2013 with construction beginning soon after. The slated date of completion for the $1.3million project would be in Fall2014.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{expand on}} their debut's sound, the xx wanted to {{minimise}} the songs they recorded for Coexist and mute certain elements during its production. Croft {{felt that this}} would <b>help</b> <b>make</b> the music more playable live {{instead of having to}} reproduce multiple vocal or guitar elements that were tracked onto a song. Smith, who produced and mixed Coexist, wanted to keep his production simple and create an emotive, electronic sound. He used Logic Pro recording software, a Space Echo effects unit, preamplifiers, and Casiotones on occasion, as well as both synthesised steelpan sounds and live percussion instruments. To engineer the album, he put together a mixing desk from pieces of other desks and left doors open during the recording to let sounds from outside the studio bleed into the mix. The xx finished recording Coexist in May 2012.|$|E
5|$|The Audubon Naturalist Society also {{actively}} opposed such spraying programs, and recruited Carson to <b>help</b> <b>make</b> {{public the}} government's exact spraying practices {{and the related}} research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become Silent Spring by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause: essayist E. B. White, {{and a number of}} journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with Newsweek science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when The New Yorker commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of Silent Spring).|$|E
