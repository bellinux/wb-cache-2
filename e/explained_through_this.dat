30|$|The large {{endowment}} difference, {{observed in}} the case of social groups, suggests that pre-labor market discriminatory practices with respect to education, health, and nutrition are more crucial in explaining wage differentials than labor market discrimination (Madheswaran and Attewell 2007). However, it may be noted that the whole part of discrimination component cannot be attributed to current discrimination. It has been argued that unequal labor market outcomes have their roots in discrimination in the past that has caused more harm to deprived backgrounds of the disadvantaged workers. Pre-labor market discrimination affects earnings indirectly by means of lower out of school investments, poor quality of education, field of study, accessibility to higher education, poorer nutrition and health status, and lower social capital. These may result in lower endowments and persistent wage differentials over time (Altonji and Blank 1999; Das and Dutta 2007).

In this way, the flow chart for the dynamic analysis of these image sequences only involves, as user’s actions, the point collimation in the first image portraying it. In fact, first, the “matching algorithm” automatically extracts the homologous point in the second image (with external orientation only approximated by “cubic splines functions”). Therefore, the “orientation algorithm”, using coplanarity condition on such a points couple, allows to improve the external orientation from spline approximated values to better ones...|$|E
40|$|Hot {{compressed}} {{water extraction}} (HCWE) is a promising alternative technology which {{has proven to}} be successful in many applications. In this study, hot compressed water extraction (HCWE) was applied in the extraction of crude palm oil (CPO) from palm mesocarp. The operating conditions investigated were pressure of 30, 40 and 50 bar with varied temperature ranging from 120 to 180 degrees C through semi-batch extraction of 10 min interval and total extraction time of 60 min. The CPO yield, free fatty acids (FFA) content through HCWE process was analysed. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) study on various palm mesocarp fibres undergone HCWE process at various conditions was also performed. The extracts formed three distinguished layers; oil, oil-water emulsion and water. The maximum CPO extracted in the oil layer was 0. 541 +/- 0. 005 (g-oil/g-dried mesocarp) with averaged FFA of 0. 81 +/- 0. 08 % at the optimum operating condition of 160 degrees C and 50 bar. CPO recovered from the emulsion was 0. 159 +/- 0. 004 g-oil/g-dried mesocarp giving a total CPO extracted at 0. 700 +/- 0. 005 g-oil/g-dried mesocarp. SEM micrographs were used to assist understanding of the mechanism that took place during the experimental conditions of HCWE.

40|$|BackgroundRecent {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that the long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist tiotropium, a drug widely prescribed for its bronchodilator activity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma, improves symptoms and attenuates cough in preclinical and clinical tussive agent challenge studies. The mechanism by which tiotropium modifies tussive responses is not clear, but an inhibition of vagal tone and a consequent reduction in mucus production from submucosal glands and bronchodilation have been proposed. ObjectiveThe aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether tiotropium can directly modulate airway sensory nerve activity and thereby the cough reflex. MethodsWe used a conscious cough model in guinea pigs, isolated vagal sensory nerve and isolated airway neuron tissue– and cell-based assays, and in vivo single-fiber recording electrophysiologic techniques. ResultsInhaled tiotropium blocked cough and single C-fiber firing in the guinea pig to the transient receptor potential (TRP) V 1 agonist capsaicin, a clinically relevant tussive stimulant. Tiotropium and ipratropium, a structurally similar muscarinic antagonist, inhibited capsaicin responses in isolated guinea pig vagal tissue, but glycopyrrolate and atropine did not. Tiotropium failed to modulate other TRP channel–mediated responses. Complementary data were generated in airway-specific primary ganglion neurons, demonstrating that tiotropium inhibited capsaicin-induced, but not TRPA 1 -induced, calcium movement and voltage changes. ConclusionFor the first time, we have shown that tiotropium inhibits neuronal TRPV 1 -mediated effects through a mechanism unrelated to its anticholinergic activity. We speculate that some of the clinical benefit associated with taking tiotropium (eg, in symptom control) could be <b>explained</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> proposed mechanism of action...|$|E
40|$|The {{mainstream}} {{stand in}} textbooks on design and design and management is that design {{is a problem}} solving process, starting from the perceived problem and ending with a detailed solution. We contend that these accounts overlook one necessary and important conceptualization of design, namely design as a physical flow process. This view holds design as a spatio-temporal process, where information (on whatever media) is traversing through a network of designers and other stakeholders. Among {{the characteristics of a}} design process, its duration, cost and often output quality can only be <b>explained</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> view. Accordingly, it is important to manage design as a physical process, based on the unique features of this view. However, due to a relative neglect of this view of design we have the situation that practical prescriptions and approaches to design management contain, at most, partial or fragmentary methods and tools towards management of the physical process side. Fortunately, the theoretical and practical development of this concept carried out in the framework of production management can be advantageously used also for the design context. However, because of the fundamental differences between material production in design, the concepts emanating from production have to be adapted for being valid design. Thus, for example, while in material production time reduction is the primary goal for management, in design, besides design time reduction, the elimination of making-do in design tasks must be taken as equally significant goal. A framework for conceptualizing management of design as a physical process has been presented, and practical development and trailing of a number of related methods in the context of building design accounted. Future work is needed for developing a seamless set of methods for design management, incorporating the concept of design as a physical process, besides other requisite concepts...|$|E
40|$|Adult {{pornography}} {{has gained}} increased {{prominence in the}} public domain. Pornographic iconography has extended into the mainstream as new technologies have contributed to its growing distribution and consumption. These social changes point {{to the need to}} examine this field of study and consider the altered place of pornography in society and the consequent socio-legal reactions to it. This dissertation examines this sexualization of culture through qualitative legal research, focusing on obscenity law in Canada. Utilizing feminist critical discourse analysis, legal provisions and cases (n= 218) between 1959 and 2009 were examined. Governmentality provides a lens through which to look at the regulation of adult pornography and comprehend the impact of neo-liberal politics on society and sexual citizenship. Using the work of such scholars as Michel Foucault and Nikolas Rose, this research contemplates the notions of ‘technologies of the self’ and ‘governing at a distance’ in relation to the production and consumption of adult pornography {{and the ways in which}} it is controlled. This research shows that adult pornography has been enabled to flourish as a commodity in a neo-liberal age which is preoccupied with the self, the individual and a ‘biopolitical’ conception of power. This development is shown through a discussion of discourses around sex and obscenity that came to light out of an analysis of the Canadian legal system. Paying attention to the judicial discourse, what becomes clear is that a harm-based approach emerges in the 1980 s and starts a trend within the legal realm to adopt neo-liberal language and concepts such as, individual responsibility and ‘freedom’. This shift towards a free-market mentality constructs a framework in which individuals are encouraged to self-regulate and police their own pornographic behaviour and consumption. Simultaneously, the neo-liberal mindset quickly perceives and defines risk in sexual content using this harm-based approach. The reduction in legal cases pertaining to adult pornography can be <b>explained</b> <b>through</b> <b>this</b> lens and changes in legal governance can be seen as playing a central role in a greater move towards neo-liberalism in Canada...|$|E
