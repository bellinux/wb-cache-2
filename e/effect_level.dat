5000|$|Long and {{co-workers}} also [...] conducted a meta-analysis using 1068 sediment toxicity assays {{to evaluate the}} predictive ability of the ERL/ERM, PEL (predicted <b>effects</b> <b>level),</b> and TEL (threshold <b>effects</b> <b>level)</b> sediment quality guidelines. They found that the ERL most accurately predicted no-effects toxicity in benthic organisms. Furthermore, it was shown that {{as the number of}} SQGs exceeded increased, the resulting toxicity of the sediment increased as well, providing strong evidence that SCGs are useful in predicting sediment toxicities. It was noted, however, that when chemicals existed in mixtures, the toxicity of sediments increased, possibly at concentrations lower than the ERL and TEL.|$|R

50|$|A {{concentrated}} extract of the Spilanthes plant identified as Jambu {{is used as}} a flavoring agent in many countries worldwide. EFSA and JECFA reviewed a feeding study in rats conducted by Moore et al. and both authorities recognized that the no adverse <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> for spilanthol was 572 mg/kg b.w./day, yielding a safe dose of spilanthol of 1.9 mg/kg b.w./day, or 133.5 mg/70-kg male/day, 111 mg/58-kg female/day, or 38 mg/20-kg child/day.|$|E
50|$|Chronic {{tests are}} {{long-term}} tests (weeks, months years), {{relative to the}} test organism’s life span (>10% of life span), and generally use sub-lethal endpoints. In chronic exposures, organisms {{come into contact with}} low, continuous doses of a toxicant. Chronic exposures may induce effects to acute exposure, but can also result in effects that develop slowly. Chronic tests are generally considered full life cycle tests and cover an entire generation time or reproductive life cycle (“egg to egg”). Chronic tests are not considered valid if mortality in the control sample is greater than 20%. These results are generally reported in NOECs (No observed <b>effects</b> <b>level)</b> and LOECs (Lowest observed <b>effects</b> <b>level).</b>|$|R
50|$|Estimating the {{interaction}} effect {{is similar to}} estimating main effects. The difference is that for interaction estimates the rows that match <b>effect</b> A <b>level</b> 1 are combined with the <b>effect</b> B <b>level</b> 1 and all combinations of <b>effects</b> and <b>levels</b> are cycled through. In our example setting, with four time point and three dosage levels there are 12 interaction sets {A1-B1, A1B2, A2B1, A2B2 and so on}. It is important to deflate (remove) the main effects before estimating {{the interaction}} effect.|$|R

50|$|ESBs {{are just}} one of {{multiple}} SQGs {{that have been developed}} for assessment of contaminated sediments. ESBs are different from other SQGs because they are mechanistically derived using chemical and physical properties.

Other SQGs include the apparent effects threshold (AET), effects range low/effects range median (ERL/ERM), threshold effects level/probable <b>effect</b> <b>level</b> (TEL/PEL), and a logistical model.|$|E
50|$|The Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) {{concluded}} that novaluron {{is unlikely to}} be carcinogenic to humans. Furthermore, it {{concluded that}} it is not a developmental toxicant. The organization established an ADI (Acceptable Daily Ingestion) of 0-0.01 mg/kg of body weight, because of the NOAEL (No Observed Adverse <b>Effect</b> <b>Level)</b> of 1.1 mg/kg of body weight per day for erythrocyte damage and secondary splenic and liver changes. This was established in a 2-year study in rats.|$|E
50|$|The {{preclinical}} toxicity {{testing on}} various biological systems reveals the species-, organ- and dose- specific toxic {{effects of an}} investigational product. The toxicity of substances can be observed by (a) studying the accidental exposures to a substance (b) in vitro studies using cells/ cell lines (c) in vivo exposure on experimental animals. Toxicity tests are mostly used to examine specific adverse events or specific end points such as cancer, cardiotoxicity, and skin/eye irritation. Toxicity testing also helps calculate the No Observed Adverse <b>Effect</b> <b>Level</b> (NOAEL) dose and is helpful for clinical studies.|$|E
40|$|The new EU {{legislations}} {{for chemicals}} (Registration, Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals, REACH) and cosmetics (Seventh Amendment) stimulate {{the acceptance of}} in vitro and in silico approaches to test chemicals for their potential to cause reproductive effects. In the current study seven compounds with known in vivo developmental effects were tested in the embryonic stem cell test (EST). The EST correctly classified 5 -fluorouracil, methotrexate, retinoic acid, 2 -ethoxyacetic acid and 2 -methoxyacetic acid for their in vivo embryotoxic potential. The toxicity of 2 -methoxyethanol and 2 -ethoxyethanol was underestimated {{due to a lack}} of metabolic capacity in the EST. This study further investigated the possibility to use in silico techniques to extrapolate in vitro effect concentrations determined in the EST to in vivo exposure levels. This approach was evaluated by comparing in silico predicted in vivo <b>effect</b> <b>levels</b> with <b>effect</b> <b>levels</b> measured in rodents. The in vivo <b>effect</b> <b>levels</b> of 2 -methoxyethanol, 2 -ethoxyethanol, methotrexate and retinoic acid were correctly predicted with in silico modelling. Contrary, in vivo embryotoxicity of 5 -fluorouracil was overestimated following this approach. It is concluded that a combination of in vitro and in silico techniques appears to be a promising alternative test method for risk assessment of embryotoxic compounds. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

5000|$|There is {{not much}} debate on the {{existence}} of an NEC [...] but the assignment of a value is another matter. Current practice consists of the use of standard tests. In the standard tests groups of animals are exposed to different concentrations of chemicals and different effects such as survival, growth or reproduction are monitored. These toxicity tests typically result in a No Observed Effect Concentration (NOEC, also called a No Observable <b>Effect</b> <b>Level</b> or NOEL). This NOEC has been severely criticized on statistical grounds by several authors [...] and it was concluded that the NOEC should be abandoned.|$|E

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} the potential concentrations of four antibiotics: ciprofloxacin (CIP), sulfamethoxazole (SUF), trimethoprim (TRI) and erythromycin (ERY) throughout the rivers of Europe. This involved reviewing national consumption rates together with assessing excretion and sewage treatment removal rates. From this information, {{it was possible}} to construct best, expected and worst case scenarios for the discharge of these antibiotics into rivers. Consumption data showed surprising variations, up to 200 -fold in the popularity of different antibiotics across different European nations. Using the water resources model GWAVA which has a spatial resolution of approximately 6 × 9 km, river water concentrations throughout Europe were predicted based on 31 -year climate data. The modelled antibiotic concentrations were within the range of measurements reported previously in European effluents and rivers. With the expected scenario, the predicted annual-average antibiotic concentrations ranged between 0 and 10 ng/L for 90 % by length of surface waters. In the worst case scenario concentrations could reach between 0. 1 and 1 μg/L at the most exposed locations. As both predicted and observed sewage effluent concentrations were below reported <b>effect</b> <b>levels</b> for the most sensitive aquatic wildlife, no direct toxicity in rivers is expected. Predicted river concentrations for CIP and ERY were closest to <b>effect</b> <b>levels</b> in wildlife, followed by SUF which was 2 – 3 orders of magnitude lower. TRI appeared to be of the least concern with around 6 orders of magnitude difference between predicted and <b>effect</b> <b>levels.</b> However, mixture toxicity may elevate this risk and antibiotic levels of 0. 1 – 1 μg/L in hotspots may contribute to local environmental antibiotic resistance in microorganisms...|$|R

50|$|Repeated {{exposure}} to fatty alcohols produce low-level toxicity and certain compounds {{in this category}} can cause local irritation on contact or low-grade liver effects (essentially linear alcohols have a slightly higher rate of occurrence of these effects).
