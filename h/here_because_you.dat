2500|$|After {{the fourth}} Test of their five-Test {{series against the}} West Indies in 1966, England were 3–0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone {{to come in to}} {{revitalise}} the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre-match dinner he said, [...] "I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> are all fighters, {{and we are going to}} keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days." [...] What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch – or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course. I take it {{that that}} was why you came over <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> {{realised}} how you were wasting your life and wanted a chance of making good in my office." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> {{sent for}} me. There's my poor friend, Mrs. Carbuncle, {{declares}} that all her credit is destroyed, and her niece unable to marry, and her house {{taken away from}} her,--all because of her connexion with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gillespie groaned. Then he said desperately, [...] "Listen here, Joseph Dylks! I {{know what}} you're after, <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> always was: other people's money. I've got three hundred dollars saved up since I paid off the mortgage. If you'll {{take it and}} go--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "that {{brings us}} to the {{question}} why you came out <b>here.</b> Was it <b>because</b> <b>you</b> had heard {{that it was a good}} country for hunting and fishing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. If I thought so, I {{would not}} have asked the question. I did {{specially}} invite her to come <b>here</b> <b>because</b> I thought <b>you</b> would like it. You have got to marry somebody." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, {{newspapers}} {{reported on}} a 1979 video that showed Sergeant Arthur Hutchinson addressing a group of police recruits.

6000|$|... "Every word a falsehood! and I, a lady,--a lady {{whom you}} have so deeply injured, whose cruel injury even you have not the face to deny,--am forced by your cowardice {{to come to you}} <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> have not dared to come out to meet me. Is that true!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In what way, pray, are you suffering? You came <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> had a wretched home, and {{a husband}} who {{was glad to be}} rid of you. You do what you like, and have what you like. Name one solitary wish of yours that has not been silently gratified." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have only}} to add, my dear Willoughby, that at Barton cottage you will always be welcome; for I will not press you to return <b>here</b> immediately, <b>because</b> <b>you</b> only can judge how far THAT might be {{pleasing}} to Mrs. Smith; and on this head I shall be no more disposed to question your judgment than to doubt your inclination." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Very well," [...] Hulton resumed in a shaky voice. [...] "I {{brought you}} <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> knew {{my son and}} I wanted your support.

6000|$|... "Then I must beg {{you to tell}} {{me which}} you mean to do.

6000|$|... "Oh, very well. Then {{father will}} have his action against you for trespass, and so you'll be brought into a court of law. You are bound to go off when you are warned.

You wouldn't dare show yourself before a magistrate, that's what you wouldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] he said, [...] "is {{something}} for which God forbid that I should take credit.

"Letty," [...] he said, [...] "if {{you have}} formed any ideas of a {{definite}} future for yourself, {{different from any}} you see before you here, {{tell me what they}} are, and I will do my best to help you.

6000|$|... "We got <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> {{asked us}} to do so if we could," [...] I answered, [...] "and we thought it rude not to accept your invitation.

500|$|In 2011, John Calvert {{stated that}} [...] "timing" [...] {{is the reason}} why a grunge revival did not happen; he says that the {{cultural}} mood of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which inspired the movement, were no longer present. Seattle songwriter Jeff Stetson states that people from the 2010s who are listening to grunge should learn about the [...] "...context and history of how it all came to be" [...] and [...] "...respect for what a truly amazing thing it was that happened <b>here</b> [...] <b>because</b> <b>you</b> probably won't see anything like it again."

6000|$|... "Ya-wa! A great mistake, for, truly, {{the chief}} of ten fugitives without a country is {{much less than the}} headman of a fishing village," [...] {{observed}} Hassim, composedly.

6000|$|... "Palter with you! Who {{dares to}} say that I palter? I have never paltered. Paltering is--lying, as I take it. Let the Countess be my enemy. I have not said that she should not be so.

"Paul," [...] he said, [...] "I {{asked you}} to invite this person in <b>here</b> <b>because,</b> now that <b>you</b> are Eve's husband, I felt that the {{interests}} of your family must be considered before my own inclinations.

5000|$|Street {{produced}} Shotter's Nation, {{the second}} album by Pete Doherty's band Babyshambles.

Street later commented that [...] "Pete wasn't in a very good state for the first couple of weeks of making the record for the reasons that people know about. It was a bit worrying to be honest with you. There were a couple of times I had to fire warning shots across his bow, say 'Listen, you've got to sort yourself out <b>here</b> <b>because</b> if <b>you</b> don't I can't work with you'.
