25|$|The goal of Sher's NIH {{grant was}} to {{determine}} if improvement in a couple's interpersonal relationship would result in sustained changes in health behavior, improvement in the couple's quality of life, and health benefits specific to the cardiac patient. Working out of labs at both the Illinois Institute of Technology and Rush University Hospital, Sher's team recruited 160 participants (approximately 35% minorities, 30% women) in which one member suffered from a cardiovascular event (e.g., myocardial infarction, bypass graft surgery, angioplasty). Using a short term couples <b>intervention</b> <b>strategy</b> designed to optimize relationships and reduce interpersonal stress, the team focused on three areas of change: exercise, weight management, and compliance with lipid-lowering medication. These areas were targeted because of the difficulty many cardiac patients face in maintaining long-term commitments to change.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Autesserre's most {{well-known}} {{research focuses on}} local violence and international intervention {{in the eastern part}} of the Democratic Republic of Congo. It culminated in her book, The Trouble with the Congo: Local Violence and the Failure of International Peacebuilding, released by Cambridge University Press in 2010. This book explains why international efforts to end civil wars so often fail. Drawing from over 330 interviews and a year and a half of field research, it presents a case study of the international intervention during the Democratic Republic of Congo’s unsuccessful transition from war to peace and democracy (2003-2006). It argues that local rivalries over land, resources, and political power motivated widespread violence. However, an international peacebuilding culture shaped the <b>intervention</b> <b>strategy</b> in a way that precluded action on local conflicts, ultimately dooming the international effort.|$|E

A quasiexperimental design was used to evaluate the relative impact of the cognitively focused self-construction and emotionally focused self-discovery strategies. Quantitative and qualitative results indi-cated that cognitively focused <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> were most efficacious in affecting self-constructive identity processes, whereas emotionally focused <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> were most efficacious in affecting self-discovery identity processes. This pattern of differ-ential effects suggests that programs intended to broadly affect identity development should include both types of <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> and should target both self-constructive and self-discovery processes...|$|R

40|$|As {{students}} {{progress through}} {{each grade level}} in school some fall behind. There is no greater educational challenge than when an 8 th grader ascends into high school. As students fail to learn the curriculum it becomes extremely difficult to continue at the same pace {{as the rest of}} the class. When students fall further and further behind they struggle, become frustrated, give up, and many end up failing the course. The purpose of this study is to examine effective <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> that help struggling students become more successful as they transition academically from middle school to high school. Specifically this research examines 80 struggling students who have been grouped into four high school Academic Success classes. These trained teachers use teacher-student rapport, engagement strategies, coping and reflection skills and behavior support plans as <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> to help students succeed. The literature and data collected demonstrate that the Academic Success classes, and <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies,</b> are helping students become more academically successful in school. From 8 th grade to 9 th grade, these students??? attendance rates increased while their discipline issues decreased. Grades in English, math and science increased dramatically and students??? overall feeling about being in the class was positive. There is a way to help struggling students in school by training teachers and implementing specific <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> that assist students before they fail. The educational system might consider using these <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> while students are struggling rather than assigning failing students to a summer school class to remediate. The key is providing timely, preventative <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> before students fail. Educatio...|$|R

40|$|Background Several stigma {{reduction}} <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> {{have been}} developed and tested for effectiveness in terms of increasing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test uptake. These strategies have been more effective in some contexts and less effective in others. Individual factors, such as lack of knowledge and fear of disclosure, and social-contextual factors, such as poverty and illiteracy, might influence the effect of stigma reduction <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> on HIV test uptake in low- and middle-income countries. So far, it is not clearly known how the stigma reduction <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> interact with these contextual factors to increase HIV test uptake. Therefore, we will conduct a review that will synthesize existing studies on stigma reduction <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> to increase HIV test uptake {{to better understand the}} mechanisms underlying this process in low- and middle-income countries. Methods A realist review will be conducted to unpack context-mechanism-outcome configurations of the effect of stigma reduction <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> on HIV test uptake. Based on a scoping review, we developed a preliminary theoretical framework outlining a potential mechanism of how the <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> influence HIV test uptake. Our realist synthesis will be used to refine the preliminary theoretical framework to better reflect mechanisms that are supported by existing evidence. Journal articles and grey literature will be searched following a purposeful sampling strategy. Data will be extracted and tested against the preliminary theoretical framework. Data synthesis and analysis will be performed in five steps: organizing extracted data into evidence tables, theming, formulating chains of inference from the identified themes, linking the chains of inference and developing generative mechanisms, and refining the framework. Discussion This will be the first realist review that offers both a quantitative and a qualitative exploration of the available evidence to develop and propose a theoretical framework that explains why and how HIV stigma reduction <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> influence HIV test uptake in low- and middle-income countries. Our theoretical framework is meant to provide guidance to program managers on identifying the most effective stigma reduction <b>intervention</b> <b>strategies</b> to increase HIV test uptake. We also include advice on how to effectively implement these strategies to reduce the rate of HIV transmission. status: publishe...|$|R
