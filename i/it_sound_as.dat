5|$|Night Trap {{designer}} Rob Fulop was irked {{that his}} relatively tame game was being compared to Mortal Kombat, {{which features a}} character ripping the heart out of a defeated opponent. Nintendo senior vice president Howard Lincoln testified {{in front of the}} committee, stating Night Trap would never appear on a Nintendo system because it did not pass their guidelines. Fulop later explained that Lincoln was referring to the technical guidelines; the game could not run on a Nintendo system {{due to the lack of}} a CD-ROM drive, but Lincoln made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if the game was unworthy of Nintendo's moral standards. Critics noted this as a deliberate move from Nintendo to distance themselves from the scandal and make Sega look unfavorable.|$|E

The Hohenzollern prince's candidacy was withdrawn under French diplomatic pressure, but Otto von Bismarck goaded the French into declaring war by altering a telegram sent by William I. Releasing the Ems Telegram to the public, Bismarck made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if the king had treated the French envoy in a demeaning fashion. Six days later, France declared war on Prussia and Southern German States immediately sided with Prussia.|$|E

She is {{everything}} that Agnes dislikes. Claire makes the statement, after telling Tobias that he {{would be better off if}} he killed Agnes, Julia, and herself, that she will never know whether she wants to live until Agnes is dead. With this statement, Albee makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if Claire holds Agnes up as a role model, a model that she has never been able to reach. And instead of trying to reach it, she has done everything to live her life in a diametrically opposed manner.|$|E

500|$|The orchestral {{interlude}} Flight of the Bumblebee {{was composed}} (c. 1900) by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov. It represents the turning of Prince Guidon into a bumblebee {{so he can}} fly away to visit his father, Tsar Saltan, in the opera The Tale of Tsar Saltan, although the music may reflect the flight of a bluebottle rather than a bumblebee. The music inspired Walt Disney to feature a bumblebee in his 1940 animated musical Fantasia and have <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if it were flying {{in all parts of}} the theater. This early attempt at [...] "surround sound" [...] was unsuccessful, and the music was excluded from the film's release.|$|E

[...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does.

500|$|... "Zoo Station" [...] came {{together}} {{near the end}} of the recording sessions when audio engineer Flood was mixing the song and introduced distortion to the drums. The song's direction was largely influenced by the production team of Daniel Lanois, Brian Eno, and Flood. Lead vocalist Bono had been disappointed with his vocals from early recording sessions for the album and told the production team, [...] "Let's just try something that's gonna put me in a completely different place". After they distorted his voice to make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if it were coming from a megaphone, Bono was inspired to sing in a persona, as the effect gave his vocals a different [...] "emotional feel". Flood mixed the final track with the assistance of Shannon Strong. Along with Robbie Adams, Strong also assisted Flood with engineering. Lanois provided additional guitar during recording.|$|E

500|$|Despite his {{relationships}} with women, Jackson's sexuality {{was the subject}} of speculation and controversy for decades. The pop singer faced allegations of being gay since he was a teenager, as well as later being labelled asexual. One 1970s newspaper story alleged that the then 19-year-old singer was to have a sex change operation and marry the songwriter Clifton Davis. Jackson found out about the story from a crying fan. The musician reassured the girl that the tale was untrue and condemned it as a [...] "stupid rumor". The story circulated for many months, during which time Jackson became upset; he was raised in a family where homosexuality was considered sinful. Jackson would continue to deny being gay throughout his life. In a 1979 interview, the pop star stated that he was not gay and that he would not [...] "have a nervous breakdown because people think I like having sex with men". He added that if he let the rumor affect him, it would make him cheap and make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if he was prejudiced against gay people. He expressed that many of his fans may be gay, and that he did not mind that. [...] "That's their life and this is mine." ...|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the songs}} on the album, Jon Pareles of The New York Times said [...] "about half are worth the effort." [...] He {{observed}} that [...] "too often, [...] falls into American culture's Disney syndrome, idealizing childhood innocence above all." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying that while No Code [...] "cracks open their sound," [...] it [...] "becomes a collection of fragments that don't add up to much of anything, except {{a portrait of a}} musically disjointed band." [...] On the change in mood compared with the band’s previous releases, he said that [...] "the album leaves you with the vaguely unsettling feeling that Pearl Jam without pain are like a pretzel without salt, or Seattle without rain." [...] Ryan Schreiber of Pitchfork called it [...] "a nice listen," [...] but stated that [...] "there's a ton of filler here. In fact, it's almost all filler." [...] Time reviewer Christopher John Farley said that the album [...] "makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if they're having a midlife crisis." [...] Farley added that [...] "too few of {{the songs on}} the Pearl Jam CD explore the musical possibilities they suggest in any kind of definitive or provocative manner." ...|$|E
500|$|The North Jersey Media Group {{gave the}} DVD 2.5starts out of five, saying that Madonna {{felt to be}} [...] "overly" [...] {{attached}} to her contemporary songs than her classic releases. They added [...] "that plodding through overlong arrangements of inconsequential songs— from the annoyingly vocoder-treated 'Revolver' early to the throwaway dance cut 'Celebration' at the end— will leave listeners wondering why so many substantial hits were given only a nod, if anything at all." [...] A review by Kevin Taft in online website [...] "Edge on the Net" [...] was overall negative. Taft noticed that Madonna's vocals were altered and mixed {{so much that it}} sounded disembodied and did not match the singer's lips. He was [...] "shocked" [...] to find that the audio CDs also contained the badly mixed songs. The reviewer explained that [...] "The choice to have the backing track turned down so low doesn't help much either. In fact, it makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if Madonna is on a cabaret stage with a five-piece band... For the six months it took Madge to edit her concert, one would wish she got her vocals to match her lips." [...] However, Taft commended the overall show and the technical brilliance accompanying it.|$|E

2500|$|But while Goldman {{was praised}} for its foresight, some argued its bets against the {{securities}} it created {{gave it a}} vested interest in their failure. These securities performed very poorly for the long investors and by April 2010, at least US$5 billion worth of the securities either carried [...] "junk" [...] ratings, or had defaulted. One CDO examined by critics which Goldman bet against, but also sold to investors, was the $800 million Hudson Mezzanine CDO issued in 2006. In the Senate Permanent Subcommittee hearings, Goldman executives stated that the company was trying to remove subprime securities from its books. Unable to sell them directly, it included them in the underlying securities of the CDO and took the short side, but critics McLean and Nocera complained the CDO prospectus did not explain this but described its contents as [...] "'assets sourced from the Street', making <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> though Goldman randomly selected the securities, instead of specifically creating a hedge for its own book." [...] The CDO did not perform well and by March 2008—just 18 months after its issue—so many borrowers had defaulted that holders of the security paid out [...] "about US$310 million to Goldman and others who had bet against it". Goldman's head of European fixed-income sales lamented in an email made public by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, the [...] "real bad feeling across European sales about some of the trades we did with clients" [...] who had invested in the CDO.

2500|$|Musically, {{the wind}} quintets {{represent}} {{a more conservative}} trend in Reicha's oeuvre when compared to his earlier work, namely the compositions of the Viennese period. [...] In the quintets, as he describes in his Preface, Reicha wanted to expand the technical limits of the five still evolving wind instruments (hand horn, 'un-rationalised' flute and clarinet, double reeds with fewer keys) and thereby the ambitions of amateur wind players by establishing a nucleus for a corpus of substantial work like that available to string players (and consciously more serious than the Harmoniemusik of the last century). [...] His writing combines virtuoso display (often still very challenging today, yet idiomatic for each instrument), popular elements (from the comic opera his soloists played, from his Bohemian folk heritage, from the military background to his life – many marches and 'walking' themes and, {{in the last two}} quintets, fanfares), and his lifelong more academic interests in variation form and counterpoint. [...] Four of the quintets have Trios in Passacaglia form, the repeating theme however being on different instruments in each case so not necessarily in the bass. Berlioz says the quintets [...] "enjoyed a certain vogue in Paris for a number of years. They are interesting pieces but a little cold", while Louis Spohr, who was visiting Paris in 1820 and reserved judgment until he had heard several performed, assessed them in a letter home (which he included in his autobiography) as having too many ideas linked carelessly or not at all, but excelling in the Minuets where this charge does not apply. Spohr was generally impressed by the virtuosity of the wind soloists and was very pleased with their performance of his own piano and wind quintet. Berlioz also comments on two of the players (in other works): [...] ", the first flute...has to dominate...so he transposes the flute line up an octave, thus destroying the composer's intention" [...] (p. 56); of 's cor anglais playing he says (p. 23) [...] "However remarkable the singer...I {{find it hard to believe}} she can ever have made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> natural and touching as it did on Vogt's instrument".|$|E
2500|$|In late 2015, Reinhart gained {{widespread}} recognition {{when her}} cover of [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] {{was used in}} an Extra Gum commercial. Entitled [...] "The Story of Sarah & Juan", the advertisement first began circulating on Facebook before a full version of the song was released separately through YouTube. The video gained momentum after being shared on Ellen DeGeneres's Facebook page, eventually becoming a viral phenomenon. In total, the single has sold 200,000 units and has been streamed more than 41,000,000 times on Spotify, reaching the number one spot on the streaming service's Global Viral chart. Meanwhile, as of January 2017, the video has amassed 20,000,000 views on YouTube and 92,000,000 views on Facebook. The song was certified gold on February 17, 2017 by the Recording Industry Association of America. Additionally, the video was a candidate in the YouTube Ads of the Year contest for 2015, and it won for the category [...] "TheYoutubeAd That Gives You Feels." [...] Reinhart was credited with [...] "bringing the classic back to the Adult Contemporary Chart" [...] when the single debuted at number 25 on the Billboard AC chart dated January 16, 2016. With this debut, her cover became the seventh version of the song to chart on the AC since Elvis Presley's original release in 1962, and the first version to chart since UB40's reggae interpretation in 1993. The song reached a peak of number 16 on the AC chart dated April 21, 2016. Of the cover, Reinhart expressed: [...] "I wanted to make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> if I was talking to or whispering to a loved one next to me, that kind of vibe." [...] For the song, Reinhart was recognized with a 2016 Women in Sync Award for [...] "Best Artist-Sync Tie-In." [...] The Women in Sync Awards is an annual event organized by SyncSummit which recognizes the [...] "excellence of the work done by women {{in the fields of}} music, visual media, interactive media, advertising and brands." [...] Reinhart also won a Silver Lion alongside Wrigley Company at the 2016 Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity in the entertainment category of [...] "Cross Channel Brand Experience" [...] for the placement of her song in the commercial. On September 28, 2016, Reinhart's cover won gold at the Clio Awards for [...] "Best Use of Music" [...] in the [...] "Short Form Film" [...] category.|$|E
