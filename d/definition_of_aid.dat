40|$|The {{interaction}} of external financing with economic reforms {{in developing countries}} {{has been at the}} forefront of the policy debate for the last 15 - 20 years. In this paper, a simple model in which an aid donor faces either a reform-minded recipient country government or one defending the status quo is constructed to investigate the impact of aid on political and economic outcomes. The main contributions of this paper are to i) show that when the aid budget is exogenous, commitment versus discretion is irrelevant to the outcome of the aid game studied here while the recipient government`s ability to tax transfers to the private sector is very important; ii) provide a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> fungibility when both the donor and the recipient act strategically; iii) point out that very large sums seems to be needed if donors are to have any influence over aggregate outcomes; and iv) demonstrate that the impact of foreign aid on the political equilibrium in democratic recipient countries can be counterproductive from the point of view of the donor...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to achieve}} an {{adequate}} discussion of the concept <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> in the European Union, covering its definitional, procedural, case law and wider policy aspects. With regard to the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid,</b> this paper concentrates on that employed by the European Commission, and discusses the (lack of) transparency <b>of</b> this <b>definition.</b> In searching for a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> {{that may be used}} in the EU context, the paper goes on to consider the procedural aspects <b>of</b> state <b>aid,</b> specifically the obligations placed on member states by the EC Treaty and the strategy of the Commission in ensuring that these obligations are met. Following on from this some consideration is given to the case law surrounding state aid, in an attempt to shed some light on the EU <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> post factum. The policy context <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> is also explored, specifically in relation to the connections between its categorised variously as industrial policy, competition policy and trade policy, which seem to depend on the specific interests involved in the aid. Although the extent to which state aid may be meaningfully classified as competition policy seems limited, increasing globalisation does seem to be leading governments to take greater account of the extra-territorial effects <b>of</b> their <b>aid</b> measures than previously. Following this and still in pursuit <b>of</b> a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> state <b>aid,</b> consideration is given to the method employed in relation to aid by both the OECD and GATT/ WTO. Conclusions are drawn which stress the persistent absence <b>of</b> ex ante <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid,</b> and call for future analysis in this area to engage in ‘open exchange’ between the disciplines of law, political science and economics, but also between the spheres of industrial, competition and trade policy...|$|R

40|$|Examining Board: Professor Heike Schweitzer, Universität Mannheim / EUI Supervisor Professor Giorgio Monti, EUI Professor Leigh Hancher, Tilburg University Mr Nicola Pesaresi, European Commission. Defence date: 3 June 2013 This {{research}} aims {{to analyse}} {{the prohibition of}} State aid and compatibility assessments in the EU {{from the perspective of}} the 'more economic approach’ (MEA). The hypothesis enunciated in the thesis is that the MEA in State aid is applied in an instrumental manner, which goes beyond the paradigm of control justified by the coordination of national policies and the reduction of distortions of competition. Hence, the shift takes place with regard to: (i) the definition of the aims of public intervention and (ii) the methods of aid assessment. Firstly, by means of the MEA the Commission pursues a horizontal industrial policy, which presupposes a more pro-active approach and verification of the positive effects of aid, to the detriment of its negative effects. Secondly, the use of the MEA is policy driven - the Commission chooses the MEA to better regulate positive criteria for compatibility of aid, while avoiding applying refined economic analysis: (i) to the <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> and (ii) to assess the magnitude of the negative effects of aid. The research conducted here is oriented around four horizontal lines: (i) conflict and complementarities between competition and industrial policy, based on the analysis of State aid rules (ii) shift from negative to positive integration, which implies a transformation of State aid control and coordination into a State aid policy and has consequences for the aims and substantive criteria of the legal framework (iii) a 'better regulation’ of State aid by means of the MEA (iv) the competence of the Member States versus the competence of the Commission in the State aid legal framework...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{examine the}} {{cyclical}} properties <b>of</b> development <b>aid</b> using bilateral data for 22 donors and 113 recipients during 1970 – 2005.

While aid outlays contract sharply during severe downturns in donor countries, they rise steeply when aid-receiving countries experience large adverse shocks. Our findings suggest that development aid may play an important cushioning role in developing countries, but only during times of severe macroeconomic stress.

40|$|Introduction. Diabetic foot {{ulceration}} (DFU) is the commonest {{cause of}} severe limb ischaemia {{in the western}} world. In diabetes mellitus, anaemia is frequently unrecognized, yet {{studies have shown that}} it is twice as common in diabetics compared with nondiabetics. We aimed to assess the incidence of anaemia and further classify the iron deficiency seen in a high-risk DFU patient group. Methods. An observational study was undertaken in a multidisciplinary diabetic foot clinic setting. All patients with DFU attending over a four-month period were included. Anaemia was defined as haemoglobin (Hb) levels < 12 [*]g/dL. Iron deficiency was classified according to <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> <b>AID</b> (absolute iron deficiency) and FID (functional iron deficiency). Results. 27 patients had DFU; 14 (51. 9 %) were anaemic; two (7. 41 %) had severe anaemia (Hb < 10 [*]g/dL). No patient had B 12 or Folate deficiency. In patients with anaemia, there was significant spread of indices. Only one patient had “textbook” absolute iron deficiency (AID) defined as low Hb, MCV, MCH, and ferritin. Functional iron deficiency (FID) was seen in a further seven patients (25. 5 %). Conclusion. Anaemia and iron deficiency are a common problem in patients with DFU.

These factors include theory, geopolitics, and institutional structures <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> agencies. Two case studies illustrate forces shaping programming. The first study demonstrates that authoritarian control by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the Wanni has undermined standard development approaches without a corresponding reevaluation of strategies. The second study investigate~ peace and conflict impact assessments. Current methodologies have difficulty demonstrating program impacts. Holistic <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> conflict-sensitive <b>aid,</b> lack <b>of</b> conceptual clarity behind projects, and weak assessment mean that forces external to peace-building concerns readily shape conflict-sensitive aid strategies. In addition, {{different approaches to}} conflict-sensitive aid are informed by competing theories of both causation of conflict and how to instigate change.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} China and Africa co-operation {{from the}} angle of structural transformation as a major driver of growth and job creation. Being a bit ahead in the structural transformation process, China can provide ideas, tacit knowledge, opportunities as well as development finances in Africa's transformation. We review critical parts of China's transformation to see if these ideas are relevant for Africa. We use empirical evidence from China-Africa co-operation and find that China-financed infrastructure projects do address Africa's infrastructure bottlenecks and hence contribute to structural transformation. In addition, China's industrial upgrading and outward investments provide opportunities for light manufacturing development in low-income developing countries. Building cluster-based industrial zones {{has the potential to}} seize the opportunities for job creation in the labour-intensive light-manufacturing sectors.

40|$|Despite the {{essential}} role of local, regional, {{national and international}} languages in human development, there is little reference to language planning in development aid discourse. Beginning with <b>definitions</b> <b>of</b> development <b>aid</b> and language planning, the paper examines how the two were linked in pre- and post-colonial times, showing how language planning scholarship has responded to the overarching shifts in understandings of development over time. While we find that language planning maintains a low profile in human development documents, we note some positive signs in UNESCO’s and UNICEF’s continuing support for language issues. We contrast this support with the World Bank’s concern with measurable outcomes. We conclude with an analysis of how the contributions to this special issue exemplify some of the tensions inherent in language planning for development in a global age.

Control <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> is <b>of</b> increasing importance {{in the context of}} European competition policy in order to maintain a fair level of activity of all enterprises participating in the European markets, regardless of the Member State in which they reside. The theoretical fundamentals <b>of</b> state <b>aid</b> are important to be studied and applied.

Doing so allows assistance to be designed and given more quickly and effectively and avoids potential problems later. A program of assistance that does not follow the rules could be forced to close. Giving state aid illegally could result in the money having to be clawed back with possibly very serious consequences for the recipient.

40|$|This thesis {{contains}} three {{essays on}} topics in agricultural economics. Essays {{one and two}} share a focus on international trade and economic development, and essays two and three apply dynamic tools to agricultural economic policy issues. Essay one analyses trade-related implications of a developing country's decision to adopt genetically-modified crop technology. A fixed-proportions model is constructed that evaluates the welfare implications {{of a range of}} adoption policies and export market responses. The model in this essay illustrates the importance of the prospective adopter formulating a projection of probable export market effects before making an adoption decision and of the role that high transaction costs may play in a developing country's adoption decision. The model also considers the effects of a new policy tool; a check-off style levy on genetically-modified technology in place of a technology-use agreement. A levy could be useful tool in developing countries, which are characterised by high transaction costs. Essay two models the effects <b>of</b> emergency food <b>aid</b> on a recipient country's agricultural industry. This essay formulates a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> “needed” <b>aid</b> {{in the context of a}} food emergency and constructs an optimal control model that solves a path <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> shipments that best meets that need. The effects of a range <b>of</b> food <b>aid</b> paths on recipient-country agricultural production are illustrated through numerical simulations. There are two key results. First, a non-optimal amount <b>of</b> <b>aid</b> can hinder a recipient-country's recovery from an exogenous food shock. Second, an exogenous shock can affect farmer revenue and therefore impact planting decisions. This effect must be considered in aid allocation policies. Essay three uses time-series econometric techniques to develop a demand model that assesses the effectiveness of commodity advertising. This essay describes the importance of considering long-run and dynamic effects in demand systems, especially in the case of closely substitutable commodities. A demand system that tests for and accommodates dynamic and time-series properties is developed and applied to US meat data. The results of this model are compared to a traditional static demand system. The dynamic model produces econometrically and theoretically sound results and generates some more intuitively appealing estimates...|$|R
40|$|There is no {{consensus}} on the supply chain management <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> resilience. To <b>aid</b> in evaluating the dynamic behaviour of such systems we need to establish clearly elucidated performance criteria that encapsulate the attributes of resilience. A literature review establishes the latter as readiness, responsiveness and recovery. We also identify robustness as a necessary condition that would complement resilience. We find that the Integral of the Time Absolute Error (ITAE) is an appropriate control engineering measure of resilience when it is applied to inventory levels and shipment rates. We use the ITAE to evaluate an often used benchmark model of make-to-stock supply chains consisting of three decision parameters. We use both linear and nonlinear forms of the model in our evaluation. Our findings suggest that optimum solutions for resilience do not yield {{a system that is}} robust to uncertainties in lead-time. Hence supply chains will experience drastic changes in their resilience performance when lead-time changes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|When {{the victim}} testified during Pamela Green 2 ̆ 7 s trial for {{kidnapping}} and gross sexual imposition, Green 2 ̆ 7 s lawyer, John Carlin, never asked her a single question. 2 ̆ 7 In fact, {{it would have}} been impossible for Carlin to cross-examine the victim because he had left the courtroom to attend a hearing for a client in another case. After Green repeatedly complained about Carlin 2 ̆ 7 s absence and asked the judge to provide her with another attorney who might actually stay in the courtroom while the prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s principal witnesses testified, the judge not only rejected the request but also revoked Green 2 ̆ 7 s bond and remanded her to jail {{for the remainder of the}} trial. Not surprisingly, Green was convicted. As the jury went out to deliberate David Hudson 2 ̆ 7 s fate at the conclusion of his first-degree murder trial, his attorney, Stuart Young, left to attend to another case after telling the judge to respond as he saw fit to any questions the jury might have. Not long after Young 2 ̆ 7 s departure, the jury asked the judge to explain the concept <b>of</b> <b>aiding</b> and abetting and to define the difference between first- and seconddegree murder. The judge responded by re-reading some of the murder instructions previously given and by reading a <b>definition</b> <b>of</b> <b>aiding</b> and abetting that the judge had read earlier for one of the other charges against Hudson. Since Young was not present for this reinstruction of the jury, there were no objections. The jury convicted Hudson of first-degree murder the next day. These two cases bear an obvious similarity: the attorneys for both Pamela Green and David Hudson were absent during portions of their criminal trials in clear violation of the bedrock Sixth Amendment rule that a criminal defendant has the right to have the assistance of counsel throughout the entire trial. When these two cases reached the Sixth Circuit on habeas corpus review sixteen years apart, however, the court applied two very different rules of decision. In Green, the court held that the temporary absence of her attorney automatically required a new trial regardless of whether Green had been harmed by the temporary absence of counsel. In so holding, the court applied the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in United States v. Cronic, in which the Court endorsed a rule of 2 ̆ 2 uniformly 2 ̆ 2 reversing a conviction without requiring a showing of prejudice when counsel was absent from a critical stage of the trial. In Hudson, by contrast, the same Sixth Circuit concluded that Cronic did not apply, and that Hudson was not entitled to a new trial because he had failed to demonstrate exactly how the temporary absence of his attorney during the trial had harmed him...|$|R
