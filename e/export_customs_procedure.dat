40|$|In this paper, I use a {{stratified}} Cox Proportional Hazard Model to econometrically {{evaluate the}} effects of intra-Africa regional trade cooperation and other underlying factors on Africa`s export survival. Using a highly disaggregated dataset of bilateral trade flows at HS 6 digit level for 49 African countries for the period 1995 to 2009, I obtain 3 key main empirical results. First, intra-Africa regional trade cooperation do {{increase the likelihood of}} Africa`s export survival. The results show that the depth of regional integration matters on lowering Africa`s export hazard rates relative to countries that are not in any regional cooperation. Second, I find evidence that supports the 'learning by export hypothesis'. That is export experience within regional as well as rest of the world markets increases the likelihood of Africa`s export survival. Finally, results suggests that infrastructure related trade frictions such as costs to export, time to <b>export,</b> and <b>customs</b> <b>procedures</b> to <b>export</b> as well as weak export supporting institutions {{have a negative effect on}} Africa`s export survival. Similarly macroeconomic developments particularly exchange rate volatility, financial underdevelopment, 'inappropriate' foreign direct investment hurt chances of an African export survival. The results also show that interaction effects between regional integration initiatives and a variety of these trade frictions namely: costs to export, time to <b>export</b> and <b>customs</b> <b>procedures</b> effects on hazard rates diminish in significance with the depth of regional integration over time...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the potential}} trade {{impact of the}} forthcoming East African Community (EAC) customs union. It examines the trade linkages among the member countries of the EAC {{and the extent to}} which the introduction of the EAC common external tariff will liberalize their trade regimes. To gauge the potential trade impact of the formation of the customs union, simulations are conducted for Kenya. The empirical results indicate that the customs union will have a beneficial effect on Kenya''s trade. The paper does not draw any conclusions on the potential welfare impact of the customs union. Finally, factors other than enhanced trade might influence Kenyan policymakers to pursue regional integration, and these include regional cooperation in "behind the border" reforms and the provision of public goods.
