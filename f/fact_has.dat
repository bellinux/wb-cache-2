5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results {{from the fact that it}} is a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E
5|$|Plant species {{found at}} this {{elevation}} include Styphelia tameiameiae, Taraxacum officinale, Tetramolopium humile, Agrostis sandwicensis, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Trisetum glomeratum, Poa annua, Sonchus oleraceus, and Coprosma ernodiodes. One notable species is Mauna Kea silversword (Argyroxiphium sandwicense var. sandwicense), a highly endangered endemic plant species that thrives in Mauna Kea's high elevation cinder deserts. At one stage {{reduced to a}} population of just 50 plants, Mauna Kea silversword {{was thought to be}} restricted to the alpine zone, but in <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> been driven there by pressure from livestock, and can grow at lower elevations as well.|$|E

5|$|Four {{different}} types of male flowers exist. On {{the basis of these}} flower types, the genus has often been split into four genera—a more narrowly defined Attalea, Orbignya, Maximiliana and Scheelea. The species sometimes referred to Orbignya have coiled anthers, while the other groups have straight ones. The petals of those placed in Maximiliana are much shorter than the stamens, while those placed in Scheelea and a more narrowly defined Attalea have petals that are longer than the stamens. Five species do not fit easily into any of these groups; this <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> been used as an argument in favour of considering this group a single genus.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the scope of review of the {{discretion}} conferred by sections 8 and 10 of the ISA {{is limited to the}} traditional administrative law grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety as established in the House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (1984), also known as the GCHQ case. The Court noted that the scope of judicial review depends on whether a jurisdictional or precedent fact is involved. Where no jurisdictional fact is involved, the scope of review is limited to the GCHQ grounds. Where a jurisdictional fact issue arises, the scope of review extends to deciding whether the precedent <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> been established. Whether a particular discretionary power is subject to any jurisdictional fact depends on the construction of the legislation which creates that power.|$|E
5|$|The {{courts in}} Singapore have {{followed}} the legal position on errors as to precedent facts in the United Kingdom. This {{is illustrated by the}} High Court case Lau Seng Poh v. Controller of Immigration (1985), which held that if a precedent fact is a prerequisite to the exercise of executive power, the court is responsible for deciding if the precedent <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> been satisfied. This principle was affirmed by the Court of Appeal case Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs (1988), which applied the principle set out in Khawaja and its departure from the approach taken in Zamir.|$|E

5|$|The current {{champion}} is Princesa Sugehit, who defeated Zeuxis on February 25, 2017 {{to win the}} championship. It is {{her first}} reign with the title, she is the 20th champion since the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission sanctioned the championship, and the 29th documented champion overall. Martha Villalobos holds {{the record for the}} longest verified individual reign with 1,399 days while Lady Apache's two reigns combine for 1,470 days the longest verified reign of any champion. Due to the undocumented periods prior to 1986 it is possible that someone else has actually held the championship longer, but no verification of such a <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> been found. Isabel Romero has held the title three times, the most for any champion, while five women have held the championship twice since it was officially sanctioned in 1986; Lady Apache, La Sirenita, Tiffany, Martha Villalobos and Zuleyma. La Diabólica holds the record for the shortest documented title reign, with 50 days.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion to withhold assent to the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. If the Tribunal determines that the bill does not have that effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day following the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court.|$|E
5|$|Electric cars, {{as well as}} plug-in hybrids {{operating}} in all-electric mode, emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates (soot), volatile organic compounds, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, ozone, lead, and various oxides of nitrogen. The clean air benefit is usually local because, depending on {{the source of the}} electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants. In a similar manner, plug-in electric vehicles {{operating in}} all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but {{from the point of view}} of a well-to-wheel assessment, the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation. This <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. On the other hand, when PEVs are recharged from coal-fired plants, they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicles and higher than hybrid electric vehicles. In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy.|$|E

David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) have agreed to cover for him, though he in <b>fact</b> <b>has</b> not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E
