5|$|Martin Bormann (17 June 1900– 2 May 1945) was a {{prominent}} official in Nazi Germany {{as head of the}} Nazi Party Chancellery.

5|$|Hitler's {{leadership}} style {{was to give}} contradictory orders to subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others. In this way, Hitler fostered distrust, competition, and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power. His cabinet never met after 1938, and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently. Hitler typically did not issue written orders, but gave them orally at meetings or in phone conversations; he also had Bormann convey orders. Bormann used his position to control the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and access to Hitler, earning him enemies, including Himmler.|$|E

5|$|In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project from OSRD, and Groves became the project's director. He {{tightened}} security, which dried up the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to Britain. American officials were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys project were trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. In October 1942, Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt that the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb project, despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.|$|E
5|$|When World War I broke out, the British cut {{the transatlantic}} {{telegraph}} cable linking the US to Germany {{in order to}} control the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> between the two countries. They also tried to shut off German wireless communication to and from the US by having the US Marconi Company sue the German radio company Telefunken for patent infringement. Telefunken brought in the physicist Jonathan Zenneck and Karl Ferdinand Braun for their defense and hired Tesla as a witness for two years for $1,000 a month. The case stalled and then went moot when the US entered the war against Germany in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Rademacher foresaw {{roles for}} other {{government}} agencies. Ribbentrop's Foreign Affairs Ministry would negotiate {{terms with the}} French for the handover of Madagascar to Germany.

Its Information Department, along with Joseph Goebbels and his Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, would control the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> at home and abroad. Viktor Brack, a division chief in the Chancellery of the Führer, would oversee transportation. The SS would undertake the expulsion of the Jews from Europe and govern the island as a police state. The Nazis expected that after the invasion of the United Kingdom in Operation Sea Lion that they would commandeer the British merchant fleet to transport the Jews to Madagascar. Many deportees were expected to perish in the harsh conditions or die {{at the hands of the}} SS.|$|E

40|$|The current {{standardisation}} {{activity of}} Open Distributed Processing (ODP) {{has attempted to}} incorporate multimedia <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> into its architecture through the idea of stream interfaces. At present the reference model of ODP (ODP-RM) abstracts from the precise nature <b>of</b> the <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>information.</b> As a consequence of this, the ODPRM only deals with syntactic aspects of stream interfaces and does not require them to satisfy any behavioural considerations. It is shown in this paper how the formal notation Z {{can be used to}} reason about these <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in a manner that enables behavioural as well as temporal aspects to be considered.

5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> but Dowding had already gone a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|The British {{bargaining}} position had worsened; the American scientists {{had decided that}} the United States no longer needed outside help, {{and they wanted to}} prevent Britain exploiting post-war commercial applications of atomic energy. The committee supported, and Roosevelt agreed to, restricting the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> to what Britain could use during the war—especially not bomb design—even if doing so slowed down the American project. By early 1943 the British stopped sending research and scientists to America, and as a result the Americans stopped all information sharing. The British considered ending the supply of Canadian uranium and heavy water to force the Americans to again share, but Canada needed American supplies to produce them. They investigated the possibility of an independent nuclear program, but determined that it could not be ready in time to affect the outcome of the war in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The perforant path is {{the main}} output pathway of the entorhinal cortex (EC). The <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> in the {{hippocampus}} is largely unidirectional. Axons from the pyramidal cells (in EC layer II) perforate the subiculum to project mainly to the granular layer in the dentate gyrus (first synaptic connection). Some axons project to CA3 and a lesser number project to CA1. The dentate granule cell axons, called mossy fibers, pass on the information, to the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal cells (second synaptic connection). From there, CA3 axons called Schaffer collaterals leave the deep part of the cell body and loop up to the apical dendrites and then extend to CA1. Axons from CA1 then project back to the entorhinal cortex (third synaptic connection) completing the trisynaptic loop or circuit.|$|E

5|$|While Hitler was in {{residence}} at the Berghof, Bormann was constantly in attendance and acted as Hitler's personal secretary. In this capacity, he began to control the <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> <b>information</b> and access to Hitler. During this period, Hitler gave Bormann control of his personal finances. In addition to salaries as chancellor and president, Hitler's income included money raised through royalties collected on his book Mein Kampf {{and the use of}} his image on postage stamps. Bormann set up the Adolf Hitler Fund of German Trade and Industry, which collected money from German industrialists on Hitler's behalf. Some of the funds received through this programme were disbursed to various party leaders, but Bormann retained most of it for Hitler's personal use. Bormann and others took notes of Hitler's thoughts expressed over dinner and in monologues late into the night and preserved them. The material was published after the war as Hitler's Table Talk.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Verifying that {{programs}} trusted to enforce security actually {{do so is}} a practical concern for programmers and administrators. However, there is a disconnect between the kinds of tools that have been successfully applied to real software systems (such as taint mode in Perl and Ruby), and information-flow compilers that enforce {{a variant of the}} stronger security property of noninterference. Tools that have been successfully used to find security violations have focused on explicit <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> where high-security information is directly leaked to output. Analysis tools that enforce noninterference also prevent implicit <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> where high-security information can be inferred from a program’s <b>flow</b> <b>of</b> control. However, these tools have seen little use in practice, despite the stronger guarantees that they provide. To better understand why, this paper experimentally investigates the explicit and implicit flows identified by the standard algorithm for establishing noninterference. When applied to implementations of authentication and cryptographic functions, the standard algorithm discovers many real implicit <b>flows</b> <b>of</b> <b>information,</b> but also reports an extremely high number of false alarms, most of which are due to conservative handling of unchecked exceptions (e. g., null pointer exceptions). After a careful analysis of all sources of true and false alarms, due to both implicit and explicit flows, the paper concludes with some ideas to improve the false alarm rate, toward making stronger security analysis more practical. ...|$|R

For dynamics at nodes we consider two ”routing algorithms ” and prove existence of solutions to Cauchy problems. The main difference among the two algorithms is the possibility of redirecting packets of the second, which in turn implies stability, i. e. Lipschitz continuous dependence from initial data, not granted for solutions using the first algorithm. 1.
