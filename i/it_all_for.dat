500|$|On July 23, 1984, Wendi Richter {{defeated}} The Fabulous Moolah at MTV's The Brawl to End <b>it</b> <b>All</b> <b>for</b> the WWF Women's Championship, ending {{what was}} billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history (Moolah's 28-year reign, though in reality she had won and lost the title on numerous occasions and Richter actually ended a 7-year reign). As a result, in early 1985, Kai—who had been trained by Moolah—wrestled Richter and defeated her for the title at The War to Settle the Score, with Moolah in her corner and singer Cyndi Lauper in Richter's corner. Richter, however, regained the title at the first-ever WrestleMania one month later.

500|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{stated that}} [...] "any fan of Dion, or of '90s adult {{contemporary}} pop in general, should find this [...] very enjoyable." [...] Although according to him, [...] "at times, the production is too slick" [...] and [...] "at other times Dion's vocals {{are a little}} mannered," [...] overall, These Are Special Times [...] "is very effective, because the songs are good and she's committed to the material." [...] Erlewine wrote that These Are Special Times is [...] "an especially successful holiday album since Dion wisely balances" [...] popular carols ("Blue Christmas," [...] "The Christmas Song," [...] "Feliz Navidad") with new songs ("I'm Your Angel," [...] "Don't Save <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>for</b> Christmas"), hymns ("Adeste Fideles," [...] "Ave Maria"), and Christmas songs with a distinct religious theme ("The Prayer," [...] "O Holy Night")." ...|$|E

[...] Verna noted that this [...] "grade-A effort" [...] is [...] "no ordinary holiday project." [...] He praised [...] "grandiose versions of standards" [...] ("O Holy Night", [...] "Adeste Fideles"), [...] "modern classics" [...] ("Happy Xmas (War Is Over)", [...] "Feliz Navidad") and [...] "thoughtfully produced original compositions" [...] ("Another Year Has Gone By", [...] "Don't Save <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>for</b> Christmas Day").

DeKnight called it the [...] "most complicated action scene" [...] in the series, due to the technical difficulty in filming it, and credited Goddard, episodic director Phil Abraham, stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera, and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it. He also named [...] films as inspiration for the sequence. There {{were only a few}} days to plan and set up the fight, as opposed to a film which would allow [...] "at least a couple of weeks", and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right. Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one-shot, and that he had intended to work around it with wipes, but Abraham challenged the team to do <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> real, which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them [...] "slow down the fight, and just have this raw, animalistic feeling happening."

500|$|To Playford's {{advantage}} {{there was}} usually {{a disproportionate number}} of South Australians in federal cabinets, both Liberal and Labor. This clout, combined with his own intensive and unconventional negotiating tactics, made sure that South Australia regularly received more federal funds {{than it would have been}} allocated otherwise. This was to Robert Menzies' chagrin, who said: [...] "Tom [...] wouldn't know intellectual honesty if he met it on the end of a pitch fork but he does <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>for</b> South Australia, not for himself, so I forgive him." [...] By the time of his departure from power, Playford gained the reputation of being [...] "a good South Australian but a very bad Australian", and for using [...] "threats to bully recalcitrant Prime Ministers". For his part, Playford remained unrepentant, claiming that federal authorities had infringed the constitution of Australia and had consistent exercised powers over the states that were not rightfully theirs. Playford accused the High Court of Australia of helping the federal parliament under Curtin to legislate to give itself a monopoly on the acquisition of income tax, which he claimed was contrary to the intention of the constitution to prevent excessive centralisation of power in the federal government. In 1958, he threatened to take the federal government to the High Court, which led to South Australia being given more compensation under the River Murray Waters Agreement for the loss of water from the Snowy River. Three years later he went to the High Court in an attempt to have Canberra pay for the standardisation of the gauge on the Broken Hill-Port Pirie railway.|$|E

500|$|Richter {{returned}} stateside {{signing with}} the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in late 1983. In April 1984, Richter teamed with Peggy Lee {{for a series}} of matches with old rivals Velvet McIntyre and Princess Victoria. WWF owner Vince McMahon brought in Cyndi Lauper for a feud with Lou Albano (who had appeared as Lauper's dad in her Girls Just Want to Have Fun music video). Albano seconded WWF Women's Champion Fabulous Moolah, while Lauper was in the corner of Wendi Richter. Richter defeated Moolah at MTV's The Brawl to End <b>It</b> <b>All</b> <b>for</b> the Women's Championship on July 23, 1984, with Richter lifting her own shoulder off the canvas during a double-pinfall situation while Moolah's shoulders remained down. With the win, she ended what was billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history (Moolah's 28-year reign as recognized by the WWF; in reality she had lost the title several times between 1956 and 1978, and Richter's win had in reality only ended a nearly seven-year reign by Moolah as champion). The broadcast of the women's match earned MTV its largest ratings in history up to that point. This match was also the beginning of the [...] "Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection", an era that combined both music and professional wrestling. Richter faced Moolah's protégé, Leilani Kai, who defeated Richter for the title, in early 1985 at The War to Settle the Score. She regained the title at the first WrestleMania one month later. While wrestling for the WWF, Richter referred to herself as [...] "150 pounds of twisted steel and sex appeal". Richter was also animated for a CBS Saturday morning cartoon, Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling. In addition, she appeared in Lauper's music video for [...] "She Bop".|$|E
