25|$|Because {{of these}} disadvantages, some moldings {{that would be}} made via this process are instead made by {{injection}} molding two or more parts in a traditional <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> <b>machine</b> and then welding them together. This process is less expensive and requires much less capital, however it imparts more design constraints. Because of the design constraints, sometimes parts are made with both processes to gain the advantages of both.|$|E
25|$|The {{application}} of the fusible core process is not limited just to the injection of thermoplastics, but with corresponding core alloys also to thermosetting plastic molding materials (duroplast). The fusible core process finds application, for example, for injection molded passenger car engine intake manifolds. By modifying the equipment, small molded parts like valves or pump housings can be manufactured, as the manufacture of the fusible cores and the injected parts {{can be carried out}} on an <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|E
25|$|Undercuts on molded {{parts are}} {{features}} that prevent the part from being directly ejected from an <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> <b>machine.</b> They are categorized into {{internal and external}} undercuts, where external undercuts are on {{the exterior of the}} part and interior undercuts are {{on the inside of the}} part. Undercuts can still be molded, but require a side action or side pull. This is an extra part of the mold that moves separately from the two halves. These can increase the cost of the molded part due to an added 15 to 30% cost of the mold itself and added complexity of the molding machine.|$|E

2500|$|Following World War II, {{plastics}} {{became available}} in Denmark, and Lego purchased a plastic <b>injection</b> <b>molding</b> <b>machine</b> in 1947. One {{of the first}} modular toys to be produced was a truck that could be taken apart and re-assembled. In 1947, Ole Kirk and Godtfred obtained samples of interlocking plastic bricks produced by the company Kiddicraft. These [...] "Kiddicraft Self-Locking Building Bricks" [...] were designed by Hilary Page. In 1939, Page had applied for a patent on hollow plastic cubes with four studs on top (British Patent Nº.529,580) that allowed their positioning atop one another without lateral movement. In 1944, Page applied an [...] "Improvement to Toy Building Blocks" [...] as an addition to the previous patent, in which he describes a building system based on rectangular hollow blocks with 2X4 studs on top enabling the construction of walls with staggered rows and window openings. The addition was granted in 1947 as British Patent Nº 587,206. In 1949, the Lego Group began producing similar bricks, calling them [...] "Automatic Binding Bricks." [...] Lego bricks, then manufactured from cellulose acetate, were developed {{in the spirit of}} traditional wooden blocks that could be stacked upon one another but could be [...] "locked" [...] together. They had several round [...] "studs" [...] on top, and a hollow rectangular bottom. They would stick together, but not so tightly that they could not be pulled apart. In 1953, the bricks were given a new name: Lego Mursten, or [...] "Lego Bricks." ...|$|E
