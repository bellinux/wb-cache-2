5|$|A Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution {{study in}} January 2009 found that emperor {{penguins}} could be {{pushed to the}} brink of extinction by the year 2100 <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>global</b> climate change. The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at Terre Adélie, Antarctica. The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony's population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.|$|E

On 1 March 2016, the airline announced the integration of domestic and international operations in Mumbai airport and moved its entire operations to the newly constructed Terminal 2.|$|E
5|$|The russet sparrow {{appears to}} be {{abundant}} in most habitats across most of its very large range, and in the some areas it {{is among the most}} common birds. In Southeast Asia, its range has contracted at lower elevations <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>global</b> warming, but it has also moved higher at high elevations and it remains common. Although its global population has not been quantified, it is assessed for the IUCN Red List as least concern for global extinction.|$|E
5|$|<b>Due</b> <b>to</b> <b>global</b> {{demand and}} the {{development}} staff's desire to further Lightning's character, development began for a sequel to XIII. The game tackles {{the question of whether}} Lightning is happy after the events of XIII. Even before a sequel was greenlit, Toriyama had wanted to create a truly happy ending for the character. Lightning's outfit in XIII-2 was designed by Isamu Kamikokuryo. He worked from a rough sketch by Nomura of how Lightning should appear. The outfit was redone several times by Kamikokuryo: a qipao and a science fiction-inspired design were both discarded because they clashed with the game's atmosphere. The final design was inspired by the valkyries of Norse mythology. The outfit was meant to reflect the environment around Lightning. It features a feather motif to represent Lightning's light, delicate side and her growing powers. She was depicted as having transcended her human limits, making it difficult to depict her as a normal person.|$|E

5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range. The possibility of hybridisation, especially in the crested newts, means that native species can be genetically polluted through the introduction of close species, {{as it is the}} case with the Italian crested newt introduced in the range of the northern crested newt. Warmer and wetter winters <b>due</b> <b>to</b> <b>global</b> warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy. Finally, the genus is potentially susceptible to the highly pathogenic fungus Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans, introduced to Europe from Asia.|$|E

The pack ice provides natural cave-like features which the krill uses to evade their predators. In the years of low pack ice conditions the krill tend to give way to salps, a barrel-shaped free-floating filter feeder that also grazes on plankton.|$|E
