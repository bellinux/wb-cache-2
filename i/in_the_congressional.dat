5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew increasingly concerned about the potential for there to be a large increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>congressional</b> representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} World War II in 1945, the rightwing {{elements}} who had {{resisted the}} US entry into World War II because of their pro-Fascist isolationism, continued their attempts to control and punish the left-leaning entertainment professionals who fought the spread of Fascism in Europe during the 1930s while the United States was technically neutral. In 1946, the Republicans gained an overwhelming majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> elections. and used this power to re-invigorate committees there that had failed to stop anti-Fascist artists before the war. The Communist victory of China in 1949 {{and the start of}} the Korean War in 1950 reinforced the anti-Communist hysteria being whipped up at the time.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{were held}} in early October from which all {{political}} parties were barred from participating.

Castillo Armas became affiliated with a party named the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (MLN), which remained the ruling party of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, {{and members of the}} military, all of whom were opposed to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>congressional</b> elections held under Castillo Armas, it was the only party allowed to run.|$|E

5|$|Major issues {{brought up}} during the {{campaign}} were the candidates' positions on President Obama's stimulus plan, which Tedisco did not take a stance on {{until late in the}} race.

Tedisco's campaign also brought up Murphy's failure to pay taxes on a company he founded in the 1990s. A frequent Murphy talking point was that Tedisco's primary residence was not <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> district.|$|E

5|$|On July 20, 1868, Secretary of State William H.

The following day, Congress adopted and transmitted to the Department of State a concurrent resolution declaring the Fourteenth Amendment {{to be a part of}} the Constitution and directing the Secretary of State to promulgate it as such. Both New Jersey and Ohio were named <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>congressional</b> resolution as having ratified the amendment, although Alabama was also named, making 29 states total.|$|E
5|$|The {{warning was}} appropriate, for <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> elections, Republicans won their biggest {{landslide}} in decades, taking {{full control of}} the House, while the Populists lost most of their support. Cleveland's factional enemies gained control of the Democratic Party in state after state, including full control in Illinois and Michigan, and made major gains in Ohio, Indiana, Iowa and other states. Wisconsin and Massachusetts {{were two of the}} few states that remained under the control of Cleveland's allies. The Democratic opposition were close to controlling two-thirds of the vote at the 1896 national convention, which they needed to nominate their own candidate. They failed for lack of unity and a national leader, as Illinois governor John Peter Altgeld had been born in Germany and was ineligible to be nominated for President.|$|E

5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the tariff was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Congressional</b> elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed to pay its operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|While {{serving in}} Congress, Jennings's health {{continued}} to decline {{as he struggled}} with alcohol addiction and suffered from severe rheumatism. In 1827 ceiling plaster from Jennings's Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head, severely injuring him, and ill health limited his ability to visit his constituents, but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>congressional</b> election of 1826, Jennings ran unopposed. He won reelection in 1828, soundly defeating his opponent, Indiana's lieutenant governor, John H. Thompson. Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams. During Jennings's final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation, was frequently not present to vote on matters, and only once delivered a speech. Jennings's friends, led by Senator John Tipton, took note of his situation and took action to block Jennings's reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability. John Carr, anti-Jackson man, opposed Jennings in a six-way race for the congressional seat and won the election. Tipton had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings's supporters. Jennings left office on March 3, 1831.|$|E
