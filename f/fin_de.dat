5|$|She {{is placed}} {{firmly in the}} imperialist {{literature}} of nineteenth-century England, and inspired by Rider Haggard's experiences of South Africa and British colonialism. The story expresses numerous racial and evolutionary conceptions of the late Victorians, especially notions of degeneration and racial decline prominent during the <b>fin</b> <b>de</b> siècle. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. It has received praise and criticism alike for its representation of womanhood.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen, liberated of {{the work}} on the daily comic, started on a comic series based on one of the novels he had read as a youth: Robert en Bertrand, the story of two Flemish tramps at the <b>fin</b> <b>de</b> siècle. The series debuted in De Standaard in 1972. The series was the first in a long time to renew the enthusiasm of Vandersteen, and the {{graphical}} quality and the stories were a lot better than most of the Studio production of the time.|$|E
5|$|Williamson {{worked on}} Secret Agent Corrigan through the 1970s until {{he left the}} strip in 1980. The first Corrigan {{anthology}} was published in France in 1975, Le FBI joue et gagne, reprinting Williamson's first episode on the feature. He returned to Warren Publishing in 1976 and again in 1979 to draw three additional stories in Creepy (#83, 86, 112). These were published in France in the collection Al Williamson: A la <b>fin</b> <b>de</b> l'envoi in 1981.|$|E

5|$|The art {{direction}} for the 1988 release was instead put {{in the hands of}} CBS Records' art director Arnold Levine and his staff. They based the cover art on a <b>fin</b> <b>de</b> siècle image of the Cliff House, a restaurant perched on the cliffs just north of Ocean Beach on the western side of San Francisco, California, built with the architectural style of a Victorian château and destroyed by fire in 1907. The back cover is a maritime landscape, modified to appear as the continuation of the picture on the front and similarly tinted in sinister black and grey colors.|$|E
5|$|In 1896 Synge visited Italy {{to study}} the {{language}} for a time before returning to Paris. Later that year he met W. B. Yeats, who encouraged him to live {{for a while in}} the Aran Islands, and then return to Dublin and devote himself to creative work. That year he joined with Yeats, Augusta, Lady Gregory, and George William Russell to form the Irish National Theatre Society, which later established the Abbey Theatre. He also wrote some pieces of literary criticism for Gonne's Irlande Libre and other journals, as well as unpublished poems and prose in a decadent <b>fin</b> <b>de</b> siècle style. (These writings were eventually gathered in the 1960s for his Collected Works.) He also attended lectures at the Sorbonne by the noted Celtic scholar Henri d'Arbois de Jubainville.|$|E

25|$|In 1882, {{with the}} inauguration of the Gotthard Railway Tunnel, the travel time between Altdorf and Biasca was reduced {{dramatically}} to only hours, though often accompanied with overnight stays in huge <b>Fin</b> <b>de</b> siècle-hotels, for example in Biasca.

25|$|The final {{recording}} {{from the}} band Absinthe (1993) featured a blend of ambient noise styled compositions with tracks titled after the works of Paul Verlaine, Charles Baudelaire and other figures in the <b>fin</b> <b>de</b> siècle Decadent movement, and a dedication to Olivier Messiaen.

25|$|A {{longer and}} {{somewhat}} different {{draft of this}} play was begun in English, and is dated December 1956. This being the case it was conceived whilst Beckett was putting the final touches to <b>Fin</b> <b>de</b> partie (which took him from 1954 till 1957 to complete) but before he began its translation into English. The original title, The Beggar and the Cripple has been scored out and replaced with The Gloaming.|$|E
25|$|Pothuau, {{named after}} French admiral and {{politician}} Louis Pothuau, was ordered on 11 April 1893 from Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée. The ship was laid down on 25 May 1893 at their Granville shipyard and finally launched on 19 September 1895, after two unsuccessful attempts on 22 and 23 August. She was commissioned for sea trials on 17 August 1896, definitively commissioned on 8 June 1897 and accepted from the builder (<b>fin</b> <b>de</b> recettes) on 9 July.|$|E
25|$|Another was Shelley's fellow British poet Lord Byron, who {{included}} Satanic {{themes in}} his 1821 play Cain, {{which was a}} dramatization of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel. These more positive portrayals also developed in France; one example was the 1823 work Eloa by Alfred de Vigny. Satan was also adopted by the French poet Victor Hugo, who made the character's fall from Heaven a central aspect of his La <b>Fin</b> <b>de</b> Satan, in which he outlined his own cosmogony.|$|E

25|$|Beckett {{translated}} all of {{his works}} into English himself, {{with the exception of}} Molloy, for which he collaborated with Patrick Bowles. The success of Waiting for Godot opened up a career in theatre for its author. Beckett went on to write successful full-length plays, including <b>Fin</b> <b>de</b> partie (Endgame) (1957), Krapp's Last Tape (1958, written in English), Happy Days (1961, also written in English), and Play (1963). In 1961, Beckett received the International Publishers' Formentor Prize in recognition of his work, which he shared that year with Jorge Luis Borges.|$|E
25|$|The Naked Ladies are {{a statue}} complex on a rockery and water cascade {{in the gardens}} of York House, Twickenham, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, England. The larger than human size statues depict eight Oceanids {{and a pair of}} aquatic horses. They were carved in the <b>fin</b> <b>de</b> siècle style from white Carrara marble and {{probably}} came from Italy {{in the late nineteenth century}} or very early twentieth century. Originally they were part of a larger set of statues that was subdivided after the suicide of the initial purchaser.|$|E
25|$|Occasionally {{governments and}} {{linguistic}} institutions of both Quebec and France have undertaken strenuous efforts to eradicate Anglicisms, often by suggesting French replacements with French phonology and morphology. Although efforts in Quebec {{have been met}} with some success (ex: <b>fin</b> <b>de</b> semaine for week-end), attempts by the Académie française have largely been unsuccessful. Sociolinguists have attributed these failures to the general inability of linguistic institutions to enforce a linguistic norm. The Académie française regularly updates a list of prescribed linguistic norms, many of which include using suggested French replacements instead of anglicisms (ex: mot-dièse for hashtag).|$|E
