40|$|Heavy high {{viscosity}} oils, transformer oils, and very light low viscosity oils {{have been used}} in a Norwegian company in the impregnation, sheathing, and installation of paper insulated cables. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine exposures to oils and other chemicals at these workplaces from 1920 to 1979. Oil mist was sampled on glass fibre or membrane filters and analysed by infrared spectroscopy. Oil vapour concentrations were measured with a direct reading total <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>analyser</b> with a flame ionisation detector. The results suggested average oil mist levels of 0. 5 - 4 mg/m 3 and oil vapour levels within 10 - 100 mg/m 3. Definitive exposure to asbestos occurred in sheathing until the late 1950 s, whereas only minor exposure to asbestos took place in installation and impregnation...|$|E
