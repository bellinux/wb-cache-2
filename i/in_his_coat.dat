5|$|Bart later {{goes back}} to the Try-N-Save and returns home with a bulge <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat.</b> Marge confronts him, believing he has been {{shoplifting}} again. She finds Bart has a picture of himself that was to be a Christmas present for her. Marge is overjoyed, and in gratitude for receiving this early Christmas gift. She gives Bart his present, the golf simulator video game Lee Carvallo's Putting Challenge. Though profoundly underwhelmed, Bart thanks her.|$|E
5|$|The episode ends when Stanley (Leslie David Baker) {{attempts}} to get a cookie from a blood drive nurse at the drive by claiming he gave blood earlier and showing a cotton ball taped to his arm as proof. The nurse recognizes he is lying because they are using band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, {{who is about to}} try the same trick. In the final scene, Creed (Creed Bratton) is seen leaving the blood mobile with a bag of donated blood <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> pocket.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins when}} a young man is seen walking alone {{in a small town}} to the snowy {{football}} fields in a morning winter. A cut-scene shows Swift inside a house wearing a comfy sweater draped over one shoulder. She is brooding and singing about her lost love while wandering morosely around her apartment. She is also seen sitting in the bathtub, missing her boyfriend who she didn't treat well when they were together. About halfway through, it starts to snow inside the spacious house. A montage of Swift writing a letter is shown alternately with scenes of her boyfriend strolling around the town. It is then revealed that the whole situation is the aftermath of a break-up between Swift and her boyfriend. It is also shown that Swift slips the letter that she has written <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> pocket before he leaves. The final scene shows her ex-boyfriend sitting in the bleachers, reading her apology letter.|$|E
5|$|Later {{she goes}} on a night out to The Loft nightclub and threatens Charlotte Lau (Amy Yamazaki). She says that she will kill Lau if she ever goes near Jake again, making viewers realise that Loretta had changed her {{personality}} and her behaviour since her absence. Loretta pretends she had Leukaemia but Jake finds out the truth and ends their relationship. She later convinces Steph that Jake lied when he told Steph that Loretta had said she was ill and she makes Frankie and Steph believe Jake is losing his mind again. She send messages from Jake's mobile phone and plants defaced pictures of her and Jake <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> {{to make it look}} real. Loretta reveals to Steph that she was sexually abused as a child. Jake gets back together with Loretta to stop her from getting him put back into a mental health clinic. Nancy finds out the truth about Loretta from Adam, she confronts Loretta who pushes her over and Nancy is badly hurt. Jake saves Nancy and she agrees not to go to the police. Loretta reveals she did not lie when she was sexually abused and Jake asks her to get help and will stand by her. Loretta is last seen admitting herself into the hospital.|$|E
5|$|Public {{sentiment}} {{was against}} Rowan {{in the matter}} of his duel with Chambers. Soon after the duel, friends of Chambers formed a posse and rode toward Rowan's house. Rowan concocted a ruse whereby he dressed a family slave <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> and hat and sent him riding from the house on horseback. The posse was fooled into thinking the slave was Rowan and gave chase, but the slave escaped and Rowan's life was spared as well. Days later, the owner of the land where the duel had taken place swore out a warrant for Rowan's arrest for murder. Some accounts hold that, as Commonwealth's Attorney, Rowan's friend Felix Grundy would have been responsible for prosecuting the case against Rowan and that Grundy resigned the position to avoid prosecuting his friend. Grundy's biographer, John Roderick Heller, admits that this was possible, although no evidence exists to confirm it. Heller also points out that Grundy was Commonwealth's Attorney not in Nelson County (the location of Bardstown), but in neighboring Washington County at the time. Joseph Hamilton Daveiss and Colonel William Allen served as counsel for Rowan. The judge opined that there was insufficient evidence to send the case to a grand jury, and Rowan was released.|$|E

The most nihilistic member of the anarchists, the Professor feels oppressed and disgusted {{by the rest of}} humanity and has particular contempt for the weak. He dreams of a world where the weak are freely exterminated so that the strong can thrive. He supplies to Mr Verloc the bomb that kills Stevie.|$|E
25|$|Sweden {{had little}} {{independent}} foreign interaction {{while it was}} committed to the Kalmar Union, and Gustav earliest reign aimed at little more than self-preservation. As he was in debt to merchant of Lübeck, he used aid of Denmark to free himself from this deal by a truce of August 28, 1537. Thereby, Sweden {{for the first time}} in its history became the mistress of its own waters. But hegemony of Denmark was indisputable, and Gustav regarded them with suspicion. When Sweden broke away from the Kalmar Union, Denmark and Norway entered into their own union, (see Denmark–Norway), and the Danish king Christian III continued to carry the Swedish insignia of three crowns <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> of arms, indicating a supposed claim of sovereignty.|$|E

[...] Following a brief argument, White shot the Mayor in the shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head. White then walked to his former office, reloading his gun, and asked Milk to join him. White then shot Milk in the wrist, shoulder and chest, and then twice in the head, execution style. Supervisor Dianne Feinstein heard the gunshots and called the police, who found Milk on his stomach, blood pouring out of his head wounds.|$|E
500|$|Yumemi {{spends her}} {{emergency}} battery life replaying her pre-war memories to the protagonist using a tiny holographic projector on her ear. When the video fades, she reveals {{that she had}} known that the planetarium would never have more customers during the 30 years she was alone, despite her apparent infinite optimism up to this point. In her final moment as she [...] "dies" [...] in front of him, Yumemi ejects the memory card from her artificial brain for his safekeeping. Touched and completely shaken {{by the loss of}} the beautiful world she left in his mind, he throws away his gun and puts the memory card <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat,</b> before wandering off with a broken leg as the fallen war machine's automated backup units are closing in on the scene.|$|E
500|$|The cavalry {{attack against}} {{fortified}} positions had failed. The Prussian infantry {{had been on}} its feet for 16 hours, half of that in a forced march over muddy and uneven terrain, {{and the other half}} in slogging battle against formidable odds, in hot weather. [...] Despite the apparent futility, the Prussian infantry repeatedly attacked the Spitzberge, each time with greater losses; the 37th Infantry lost 992 men and 16 officers, more than 90 percent of its force. The King himself led two attacks of the 35th Infantry, and lost two of his horses in the effort. [...] He was mounting a third when the animal was shot in the neck and fell to the ground, nearly crushing the King. [...] Two of Frederick's adjutants pulled him from under the horse as it fell. A ball smashed the gold snuff box <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat,</b> and this box, plus his heavy coat, probably saved his life.|$|E

500|$|Other {{insignia}} {{include the}} processional cross, the mitre and the crosier. Eastern traditions favor {{the use of}} their own style of head gear and crosier, {{and the use of the}} mantle or cloak rather than the ecclesiastical hat. The motto and certain shapes of shields are more common in ecclesiastical heraldry, while supporters and crests are less common. The papal coats of arms have their own heraldic customs, primarily the Papal Tiara (or mitre), the keys of Saint Peter, and the ombrellino (umbrella). Pope Benedict XVI replaced the use of the Papal Tiara <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> of arms with a mitre. He was the first pope to do so, despite the fact that Pope Paul VI was the last pope to be crowned with the tiara. [...] The arms of institutions have slightly different traditions, using the mitre and crozier more often than is found in personal arms, though there is a wide variation in uses by different churches. [...] The arms used by organizations are called impersonal or corporate arms.|$|E
500|$|The trick {{has since}} been often {{repeated}} and explained. The medium must have the semblance of key-board, made of some light material, concealed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>coat</b> sleeve or about his person. This he attaches {{to the bottom of}} the accordion which he holds in his hand. Then when unobserved, while the learned professor is [...] "taking down his notes" [...] for the public press, he reverses the accordion, and attaching the false keyboard on the bottom by means of a small hook attached to it, fastens it to the side of the basket; having now the real keyboard in his hand he is able to produce musical sounds. Afterward the accordion floated about in the basket under the table, without the contact of Mr. Home's hand. This subsequent phenomenon was given to avoid immediate examination of the first by keeping Professor Crookes in suspense, and giving the medium time to reverse the instrument and conceal in his clothing the false key-board which had been on the bottom of the instrument. The accordion was suspended by means of a small hook fastened to dark thread, which would be invisible in the gas-light.|$|E
