500|$|The {{composition}} comprises two verses, a two-round instrumental break, and two further verses. In his lyrics, Harrison unashamedly states {{his love}} for Boyd; Pollack describes the message as [...] "unusually unmuddled romantic euphoria". Early in the song, Harrison tells her, [...] "I loved you <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> saw you", and by the last verse, {{in the description of}} author Ian Inglis, [...] " [...] 'sweet and lovely' personality makes her irresistible... he now loves her 'more than ever.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas {{the first}} song {{was a little bit}} more artistic and a little bit more soulful, and it has done everything, it {{probably}} exceeded my expectations, I mean, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> was able to give it away. I was able to kind of be reintroduced in a way musically, and thank you to [...] Diplo, but 'Scream' is really like the next step. It's just in time for summer and the type of experience that I want people {{to get out of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|In a 2003 interview, Jordison {{explained}} {{that despite the}} initial problems more than enough material was written for the album and added that [...] "it's better to have stuff to pick from than to settle for shit", in contrast to how Slipknot settled too soon with fewer songs on previous albums. Band members were divided over their experience of working with producer Rubin; some doubted his commitment to Slipknot as he split his time between many artists at once. Lead vocalist Corey Taylor admitted {{in an interview that}} he drank heavily throughout their time in the mansion, saying [...] "I would drink <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> got up until the moment I passed out." [...] He {{explained that}}; [...] "everything I did while I was drinking sounded like shit", while expressing how unhappy he was with the choice of vocal takes which ended up on the album. During this time, percussionist Crahan worked on , a video documenting the creation process of the album and the touring which would follow.|$|E

500|$|By {{the mid-1960s}} Harrison {{had become an}} admirer of Indian culture and mysticism, {{introducing}} {{it to the other}} Beatles. During the filming of Help! in the Bahamas, they met the founder of Sivananda Yoga, Swami Vishnu-devananda, who gave each of them a signed copy of his book, The Complete Illustrated Book of Yoga. Between {{the end of the last}} Beatles tour in 1966 and the beginning of the Sgt Pepper recording sessions, he made a pilgrimage to India with his wife Pattie; there, he studied sitar with Ravi Shankar, met several gurus, and visited various holy places. In 1968 he travelled to Rishikesh in northern India with the other Beatles to study meditation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: [...] "For me, it was like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to reveal them. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> had that, I wanted to have it all the time – these thoughts about the yogis and the Himalayas, and Ravi's music." ...|$|E
500|$|The young Alf Ramsey was {{described}} by his friend Fred Tibble as [...] "a very quiet boy who really loved sport". In his 1952 autobiography Talking Football, Ramsey would describe [...] "liv for the open air <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> could toddle", spending hours each day in the meadow behind the family cottage, playing ball games with his brothers. He learned skills such as ball control, kicking and heading with a tennis ball. From the age of five, Ramsey attended Becontree Heath School, which had a roll of about 200 pupils aged from four to 14. He and his brothers had to walk two hours from their house to get there, and passed a ball between {{each other on the}} way to break the monotony. Ramsey was not especially popular socially, nor particularly diligent as a student, but he excelled in sports. In addition to football, he played cricket to a high standard and represented the school in the high jump, the long jump, the 100-yard and 200-yard dash. Despite his diminutive stature, he also enjoyed boxing until an incident when he was 10 years old, when a much larger opponent—"as wide as I was tall" [...] in Ramsey's recollection—gave him a severe beating in a school tournament. Ramsey carried a noticeable scar above his mouth, a memento of this fight, {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
500|$|... "Running Back" [...] {{was written}} by Mauboy, Mtawarira, and Sean Ray Mullins, and was {{produced}} by Audius. [...] "Running Back" [...] {{is one of the}} three tracks Audius produced for the album. Mullins has stated that when he hears the song on the radio, [...] "he's merely satisfied" [...] that it fits the formula. [...] "Running Back" [...] was recorded at The Sound Academy in Sydney, New South Wales, and Phil Tan mixed the track at Soapbox Studios, Atlanta, Georgia. Mauboy and Flo Rida recorded their verses in separate studios. She said that the song is based on [...] "one of my past experiences". In an interview with Take 40 Australia, Mauboy said working with Flo Rida was a dream come true, [...] "I love urban music and have been a huge fan of Flo-Rida's <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> heard 'Low'. For him to now feature on my first single I just can't believe it! I am so excited and honoured." [...] "Running Back" [...] is an urban pop ballad, featuring [...] "a restrained vocal performance from Mauboy." [...] According to Davey Boy from Sputnikmusic, the song [...] "is one-part smooth ballad with its twinkling piano loop and lovelorn lyrics, and one-part contemporary hip hop with its deceptively slinky vocals and effective—if phoned in—Flo Rida cameo." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{made his}} full {{international}} debut for England on 19 May 1951 against Portugal at Goodison Park, Liverpool, {{and made an}} immediate impression by scoring with his first touch of the ball after only 19 seconds. This proved to be his only international appearance due to injuries, the dominance of Billy Wright, and his habit of putting his club before his country. Nicholson {{is quoted as saying}} [...] "My duty is to get fit for Tottenham. Well, they pay my wages, don't they?". Of his only appearance he said [...] "Stan Pearson nodded it back and I ran on to let go a first time shot which, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> hit it, I knew was going in. But for the next game they brought back Billy Wright and I accepted that because he was the better player". Nicholson is the only player to have scored for England with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again.|$|E
2500|$|Principal {{photography}} started mid-October 2011, {{and took}} place at Joss Whedon's residence in Santa Monica, California. On the choice of location, he told Studio 360, [...] "First of all, my wife built that house. And I knew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> <b>I</b> set foot in it that I would want to film something there. Because it's all in one place, that place informs the mood and the feeling and {{the look of the}} picture so much, and I was really already comfortable with that". Whedon and his wife, Kai Cole, produced the film through their studio Bellwether Pictures. It was filmed entirely in a black-and-white palette over a period of 12 days, in conjunction with cinematographer Jay Hunter. Whedon shot it while on a contractual vacation from the post-production of The Avengers. The cast and crew were informed to keep the project a secret until production was finished. They wrapped their last day of filming on October 23, 2011.|$|E

40|$|A brief {{discussion}} of massive tadpole diagrams and their phenomenological consequences is presented. This includes {{predictions of the}} ρ parameter and, as a consequence, {{the mass of the}} W boson, implications on the charm and bottom quark masses <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>moments,</b> <b>i.</b> e. <b>the</b> derivatives of the current correlators, and the Higgs boson decay rate. A fairly consistent picture emerges, with m_c(3 GeV) = 0. 986 ± 0. 013 GeV and m_b(m_b) = 3. 610 ± 0. 016 GeV. Furthermore, fairly stringent predictions for the Higgs decay rate into photons and gluons are obtained, which will be interesting in increasingly precise experiments.
