5|$|We {{all had a}} {{collective}} feeling like we'd had enough {{of this kind of}} shit. It wasn't anything tangible anybody said to anyone else, it was just kind of like everything over the years had come to a head on that one particular night in the one particular place, and it was not an organized demonstration... Everyone in the crowd felt that we were never going to go back. It was like the last straw. It was time to reclaim something that had always been taken from us.... All kinds of people, all different reasons, but mostly it was total outrage, anger, sorrow, everything combined, and everything just kind of ran its course. It was the police who were doing most of the destruction. We were really trying to get back in and break free. And we felt that we had freedom at last, or freedom to at least show that we demanded freedom. We weren't going to be walking meekly in the night and letting them shove us around—it's like standing your ground {{for the first time and}} in a really strong way, and that's what caught the police by surprise. There was something in the air, freedom a long time overdue, and we're going to fight for it. It took different forms, but the bottom line was, we weren't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> And we didn't.|$|E
500|$|Yeah, I {{really felt}} {{at that point}} she was pretty strung out. Her whole world was rocked. She never thought she could get {{pregnant}} {{and then all of}} a sudden she's carrying this child and she's experiencing this soul for the first time in four hundred years. [...] the realisation that as soon as the baby's born the soul's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away,</b> and it's the first time she really experienced true love, so she was going through a lot emotionally. I just didn't think that she would have time to really think about how she looked. I don't think it was a priority, and so for me as an actor it was important that I reveal that. Not get caught up in my own vanity as an actress, and portray the character as where she really was.|$|E
500|$|During {{a conference}} call with journalists, actor John Noble called [...] "6:02 AM EST" [...] and the next two episodes of the third season an [...] "epic trilogy". He {{elaborated}} [...] "All year we've been heading toward the fact that {{there seems to be an}} inevitable conflict between the two universes. And we've gotten to know the people on both sides now, so we now bring it to a conclusion starting with '6:02.' By the next episode we start to deal with the issue because our earth starts to deteriorate. Events start to happen here which indicate that our world is degrading. And so everyone has to move into another gear and say, 'Okay, this problem is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> It's now affecting our side. We do have a machine which we believe can assist in the resolution of this problem.' And so the episode basically deals with the lead-up in the first part of that trilogy, leading up to the use of that machine." [...] In the same interview, Noble called the episode's title very critical to the series, stating [...] "That time frame plays through the three episodes. Very important to remember as we get to the finale, that time frame." ...|$|E
60|$|But this, he {{acknowledged}} to himself, {{was a thing}} he had never done before. The fellow was too exasperating. His own nerves must be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> pieces. He <b>went</b> <b>away</b> for some days with a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mrs. Easterfield, [...] "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let her <b>go</b> <b>away</b> at present, and if Captain Asher {{should say}} {{anything}} {{to you on the}} subject, you are at liberty to tell him that. From what you said the other day, I suppose you will soon be leaving this quiet valley for the haunts of men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have tried}} to. And I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let you <b>go</b> <b>away</b> {{thinking}} that the reason I said is the only reason. It isn't. I wish to be free because--there is some one else, now." [...] It {{was hard to tell}} him this, but she knew that she must not do less; and the train that carried him from Venice that night bore a letter from her to Hinkle.|$|R
2500|$|After {{signing a}} {{recording}} deal with Polydor Records in July 2009, Goulding's debut album, Lights, {{was released in}} February 2010 to generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart, and has since sold 740,723 copies in the United Kingdom and 1.6 million copies worldwide. In February 2011, Goulding told the Daily Star that she had plans to release a follow-up to Lights sometime in 2011, commenting, [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> for ages. It'll be out this year or the start of next." [...] In April 2012, Goulding stated that she hoped the album would be released in October 2012.|$|E
6000|$|... "That," [...] I replied, with dignity, [...] "is {{just what}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> and boil. At least, I mean, I shall now leave you. I have said my say." ...|$|E
60|$|Few people passed. The {{man out of}} {{the last}} house passed on his way home; she heard his {{footsteps}} clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses. One time {{there used to be a}} field there in which they used to play every evening with other people's children. Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it--not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs. The children of the avenue used to play together in that field--the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she and her brothers and sisters. Ernest, however, never played: he was too grown up. Her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then. Her father was not so bad then; and besides, her mother was alive. That was a long time ago; she and her brothers and sisters were all grown up; her mother was dead. Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> like the others, to leave her home.|$|E
5000|$|On April 24, 2016, Lodhi invited Leonardo DiCaprio to Pakistan after {{a meeting}} {{with him at the}} UN. On 30 May 2016, talking to the {{students}} at the Harvard Kennedy School, Lodhi claimed that Pakistan’s massive military operation aimed at rooting out terrorism is in its final phase but the menace is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> just <b>go</b> <b>away</b> unless there is peace {{on the other side of}} the border in strife-torn Afghanistan. On January 6, 2017, Lodhi provided a dossier on captured Indian spy Kulbhushan Yadav and evidence of attempted violation of maritime boundary by an Indian submarine to António Guterres. On 7th Febuaray 2017, Lodhi opposed the G4 nations submission on UN security reform saying that it is [...] "inconceivable" [...] to establish any institution that does not value [...] "principles of representation and accountability" [...] through periodic elections.|$|R
25|$|The {{other major}} {{sticking}} point, which is reportedly causing concern at government level, {{is that the}} majority of people <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Potsdamer Platz are visitors to the city, implying that the original vision of the development as a linking element attracting Berliners themselves, and Berliners {{from both sides of the}} former divide, has not really materialised. There are criticisms that the development does not sit easily with or connect with its surroundings, and as a result Berliners have had difficulty accepting it as theirs (despite the fact that the choice of Hilmer & Sattler's masterplan was partly because it was the only one to address the way the development juxtaposed with the Cultural Forum immediately to the west, although the Cultural Forum has itself faced similar criticisms of its own). Another, more psychological factor that has played a part here is that a long-standing mutual distrust or antipathy felt between former East Berliners and West Berliners (Ossis and Wessis according to the well-known slang terms), is still very much in evidence in the city and elsewhere in Germany, and bold civil engineering projects and architectural statements are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make it <b>go</b> <b>away</b> by themselves. Politicians past and present have been accused of short-sightedness in speculating that they would.|$|R

5000|$|I think I {{was reading}} the Bible around that time. That's where I think phrases such as [...] "workman's wages" [...] came from, and [...] "seeking out the poorer quarters".

50|$|The term {{refers to}} a question, problem, solution, or {{controversial}} issue which is obvious to everyone who knows about the situation, but which is deliberately ignored because to do otherwise would cause great embarrassment, or trigger arguments or is simply taboo. The idiom can imply a value judgment that the issue ought to be discussed openly, or it can simply be an acknowledgment {{that the issue is}} there and not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> by itself.|$|E

5000|$|Anthropologist Robin Dunbar at Oxford University argues against Crabtree's {{position}} that brain size {{was driven by}} tool use. Instead, Dunbar argues that the social environment drives intelligence. [...] "In reality what has driven human and primate brain evolution is the complexity of our social world", says Dunbar. [...] "That complex world is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Doing things like deciding who to have as a mate or how best to rear your children {{will be with us}} forever." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{long time}} ago {{there was only a}} single empire that existed on the continent. The country {{experienced}} tranquility and peace and did not know the conflating deadly diseases that spread around the world. Innocent people suffered as those who were slain by these beasts or choked to death by disease later rose again as undead. The undead caused chaos and destruction in their wake in seemingly endless numbers. Their tireless existence appeared as if this problem was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away.</b> Eventually, the single empire collapsed and became three separate kingdoms, all fighting for their own survival.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{completion}} of Shaun of the Dead, Pegg was questioned {{as to whether}} he would be abandoning the British film industry for Hollywood, and he replied, [...] "It's not like we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> and do, I don't know, Mission: Impossible III", picking the title of an imaginary blockbuster. When the film Mission: Impossible III was subsequently made, Pegg appeared in it as Benji Dunn, an IMF technician who assists Tom Cruise's character Ethan Hunt. He reprised the role of Benji Dunn in the 2011 film Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol and the 2015 film Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation.|$|E

5000|$|After much soul- searching, Ruth and Kurt {{decided to}} call it a day. [...] "I am going to let {{everyone}} get on with their lives. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> to grow up, so we can both work out what we really want…" [...] Kurt said, and he left, promising Ruth that he would always be her friend. Tragically, just six months after saying goodbye, he was killed in a jet ski accident. Lucy later found out the accident had been caused by Rob {{but it turned out to}} have been a random hit and run and Rob had told people he killed him to look hard.|$|E

[...] Despite the release of Obama's notarized birth certificate abstract, Farah demanded that Obama release his [...] "long-form" [...] birth certificate, which was subsequently posted on the White House's web site on April 27, 2011. Farah had previously pledged $15,000 to the hospital where Obama was born upon the release of said document. When Obama finally released the long-form birth certificate, he called it [...] "fraudulent," [...] and disowned the pledge.|$|E
50|$|With the {{continued}} delays on the OCR project, {{it became clear}} that punched cards were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> any time soon, and CDC had to address this as quickly as possible. Although the 405 remained in production, it was an expensive machine to build. So another purchase was made, Bridge Engineering, which offered a line of lower-cost as well as higher-speed card punches. All card-handling products were moved to what became the Valley Forge Division after Bridge moved to a new factory, with the tape transports to follow. Later on, the Valley Forge and Rochester divisions were spun off to form a new joint company with National Cash Register (later NCR Corporation), Computer Peripherals Inc (CPI), in order to share development and production costs across the two companies. ICL later joined the effort. Eventually the Rochester Division was sold to Centronics in 1982.|$|E
50|$|He first appears {{having won}} a trophy, {{a fact that}} Rory is very excited about. His sport is {{swimming}} {{and he has a}} love/hate relationship with Marla. After Marla's ex Jay Kelso returned on her 18th Birthday, Elliott has told Marla how he feels and has told her that he will give her some space for the time being to think about who she wants to be with and because of this he is now competing with Jay for Marla's affection. Elliott gives Marls his car to practise driving as he says he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>away</b> for a bit. When Elliott tells Marla that he spotted Jay and Marla's mother Amy talking a making a deal, Marla asks him if he heard what they said which he responded no which makes Marla think that Elliott is just jealous because she has chosen Jay over him. When Marla asks Jay why he didn't deny it, he reassures her that they did have a deal but it was that if Jay promised to look after Marla then her parents would give them some space.|$|E
5000|$|Verbal prefixes {{are used}} to modify {{the meaning of the}} verb in both {{concrete}} and abstract ways.
