5|$|Although no new {{elements}} (apart from einsteinium and fermium) {{could be}} {{detected in the}} nuclear test debris, and the total yields of transuranium <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> disappointingly low, these tests did provide significantly higher amounts of rare heavy isotopes than previously available in laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Bombarding curium-242 with α-particles {{resulted}} in an isotope of californium 245Cf (1950), and a similar procedure yielded in 1949 berkelium-243 from americium-241. The new <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> named after Berkeley, California, by analogy with its lanthanide homologue terbium, which was named after the village of Ytterby in Sweden.|$|E

5|$|In {{conjunction}} with the Blu-ray release, a limited one-week release in IMAX theaters was announced for September 7, 2012. Steven Spielberg and sound designer Ben Burtt supervised the format conversion.

5|$|Many planned <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> never filmed, due to {{production}} time constraints. Moore {{had hoped for}} an extended battle scene in which Data would be electrocuted, and Wesley Crusher blown up in an explosion. Production of the episode ended on December 19.|$|E
5|$|On 23 October 1946, the {{division}} was reactivated in Norfolk, Virginia. However, its subordinate <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> not fully manned and activated for several years.

5|$|The first largely {{complete}} set of oscillator strengths of singly ionized iron-group <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> made available in the 1960s, and these were subsequently improved. In 1978, the abundances of singly ionized elements of the iron group were derived.|$|E
5|$|A {{reviewer}} at RPGFan {{praised the}} game for its plot, its intimate scope, and its music, while a writer for Famitsu found the game's mood to be boring. As the science fiction <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> well received, later entries in the series gradually {{moved away from the}} dating theme and became more focused on science fiction. The PlayStation Portable version of the game was the 967th best selling video game of the year in Japan in 2009.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and back projection was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E

Autonomous custom <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> HTML <b>elements</b> that <b>are</b> entirely separated from native HTML <b>elements,</b> they <b>are</b> essentially built {{from the bottom}} up using the Custom Elements API. Customized built-in <b>elements</b> <b>are</b> <b>elements</b> that <b>are</b> built upon native HTML elements to reuse their functionality.|$|R

5|$|Although {{most of the}} character's {{specifications}} {{could be}} customized, some <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> {{to be determined by}} the game's two character types, Legendary and Dreaded. Choosing a type {{at the beginning of the}} game affected several gameplay and story elements. Each character type had unique features that shaped the way the game was experienced, including how the environment and non-playable characters interacted with the player.|$|E
5|$|Although the duo {{felt that}} the presets and {{parameters}} of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that Random Access Memories {{could not have been}} made in the complete absence of computer technology. The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two they preferred. Subsequently, the <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.|$|E
5|$|By March 1, 2005, over a {{year after}} the war ended, the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) had {{disarmed}} and demobilized 103,018 people who claimed to have fought for former president Charles Taylor or the two rebel groups, Liberians United for Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) or the Movement for Democracy in Liberia (MODEL). That year most former AFL <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> concentrated at Camp Schiefflin.

5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} explained if the electrons in an atom were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|During {{much of the}} war, the 2nd Canadian Regiment {{was known}} as Congress's Own Regiment, and Livingston's command {{continued}} {{to be known as}} the Canadian Regiment. Greatly depleted by its five years of service, Livingston's regiment was disbanded in the reorganization of the Continental Army on January 1, 1781. Its Canadian <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> assigned to Hazen's command, which was then redesignated as the Canadian Regiment.|$|E
5|$|In 1923, four {{predicted}} <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> {{still missing}} from the periodic table: 43 (technetium) and 61 (promethium) are radioactive elements and are only present in trace amounts in the environment, thus making elements 75 (rhenium) and 72 (hafnium) the last two unknown non-radioactive elements. Since rhenium was discovered in 1908, hafnium was the last element with stable isotopes to be discovered.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, B. B. Cunningham {{obtained}} the first bulk chemical compound of a transplutonium element, namely americium hydroxide. Over {{the next three}} to four years, milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (Thomson, 1949) and californium (Thomson, 1950). Sizeable amounts of these <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G.

5|$|In {{his report}} on The Periodic Law of the Chemical Elements, in 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev had implicitly {{predicted}} {{the existence of}} a heavier analog of titanium and zirconium. At the time of his formulation in 1871, Mendeleev believed that the <b>elements</b> <b>were</b> ordered by their atomic masses and placed lanthanum (element 57) in the spot below zirconium. The exact placement of the elements and the location of missing elements was done by determining the specific weight of the elements and comparing the chemical and physical properties.|$|E
