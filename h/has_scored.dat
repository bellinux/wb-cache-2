40|$|Introduction: With due {{attention}} to great application of irreversible hydrocolloid impression material in treatment dentistry and importance accuracy of impression in final result of treatment {{was necessary to}} study the all of effect factors on the accuracy impression. So this study was done for comparison of surface detail reproduction some {{of the kinds of}} irreversible hydrocolloid. Materials and Methods: In this laboratorial experimental study, was used the recommended laboratoril model of the standard (Iran) and research organization, with the registration number 2787. The form of this model was a stainless steel slotted block in 20, 50 and 75 sizes. The impression materials that used were Super Iralgin, Iralgin and Bayer irreversible hydrocolloid. For each materials was take 20 impression in the same conditions and was poured with type III gypsum and totally 60 cast models was earned. These models were observed with steriomicroscope randomly and each of the identical lines 20, 50 and 75 were allowed with a specific score. For evaluation of the results was used statistic analysis of Mann-Whitney Test and Kruskal Walli's(a = 0. 05). Results: In registration of 20 -line, 20 samples of Super Iralgin had sore 3, 19 samples of Regular Iralgin and Alginoplast <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 3 and 1 sample score 4. The difference among these 3 groups was not significant (p value = 0. 601). In registration of 50 -line, 15 samples of Super Iralgin <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 2 and 5 samples <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 3, 7 samples of Alginoplast, <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 2, 13 samples <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 3, 6 samples of in Regular Iralgin <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 2 and 14 samples <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 3. The difference among these 3 groups was significant (p value = 0. 008). In registration of 75 -line, 15 samples of Super Iralgin <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 1 and 5 samples <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 2, 7 samples of Aliginoplast score 1 and 13 samples <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 2, 6 samples of Regular Iralgin <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 1 and 14 samples <b>had</b> <b>score</b> 2. The difference among these 3 groups was significant (p value = 0. 008). Conclusion: In registration each three lines, the super Iralgin was more precises than the other types and was an ideal impression material. In registration of 20 -line, Regular Iralgin and Alginoplast were in the same level, but in registration two others lines, Alginoplast was more precise. It is better to advise to the factory necessary recommendations {{to improve the quality of}} the Regular Iralgin material.
