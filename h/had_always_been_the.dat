5|$|Lo Pui Sang v. Mamata Kapildev Dave (2008) took {{a narrow}} {{approach}} to the reading of personal liberty in Article 9(1). The High Court of Singapore held that personal liberty only refers to freedom from unlawful incarceration or detention, and does not include a liberty to contract. Although it was suggested this <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> understanding of the term, no authority was cited.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{plans were}} drawn up to quell Welsh {{nationalism}} by affiliating Elizabeth {{more closely with}} Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, {{at a time when}} Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Stunned, the {{remaining}} Chili Peppers, {{who had no}} suitable replacement for Frusciante, hired Arik Marshall to play {{the remaining}} dates after being forced to reschedule. Upon returning to Hollywood, the band placed {{an ad in the}} L.A. Weekly for open guitar auditions, which Kiedis considered to be a waste of time. After several months of unsuccessfully looking for a suitable guitarist, drummer Chad Smith suggested Dave Navarro. He <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> band's first choice, but had been too busy following the 1991 breakup of Jane's Addiction. Navarro eventually accepted the position after productive jam sessions.|$|E

5|$|The Book of the Dead {{was part}} of a {{tradition}} of funerary texts which includes the earlier Pyramid Texts and Coffin Texts, which were painted onto objects, not papyrus. Some of the spells included were drawn from these older works and date to the 3rd millennium BCE. Other spells were composed later in Egyptian history, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (11th to 7th centuries BCE). A number of the spells which made up the Book continued to be inscribed on tomb walls and sarcophagi, as <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> spells from which they originated. The Book of the Dead was placed in the coffin or burial chamber of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|The plebeians {{had finally}} {{achieved}} political equality with the patricians. However, {{the plight of}} the average plebeian had not changed. A small number of plebeian families achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic patrician families had always had, but the new plebeian aristocrats became as uninterested in {{the plight of the}} average plebeian as the old patrician aristocrats <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been.</b> <b>The</b> plebeians rebelled by leaving Rome and refusing to return until they had more rights. The patricians then noticed how much they needed the plebeians and accepted their terms. The plebeians then returned to Rome and continued their work.|$|E
5|$|Archbishop Lucas {{fell out}} of favor with Béla, and was ignored by {{him in the first}} years of his reign. Instead of Lucas, the Archbishop of Kalocsa baptized Béla's first-born son, Emeric, in 1174. However, {{administering}} sacraments to members of the royal family <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Archbishops of Esztergom's job. According to a Bohemian chronicle (Continuatio Gerlaci abbatis Milovicensis), Béla imprisoned his younger brother, Géza, but Géza escaped from prison and fled to Austria in 1174 or 1175. Stephen III's judge royal, Lawrence, accompanied Géza. When Henry Jasomirgott, Duke of Austria, refused to extradite Géza, Béla launched plundering raids into Austria, together with Soběslav II, Duke of Bohemia. Meanwhile, Béla sent reinforcements to Emperor Manuel to help him fight against the Seljuks, but their united forces suffered defeat in the Battle of Myriokephalon on 17 September 1176.|$|E

5|$|On December 15, 1987, {{entrepreneur}} Jerry Richardson {{announced his}} bid for an NFL expansion franchise in the Carolinas. A North Carolina native, Richardson was a former wide receiver on the Baltimore Colts who had used his 1959 league championship bonus to co-found the Hardee's restaurant chain, later becoming president and CEO of TW Services. Richardson drew his inspiration to pursue an NFL franchise from George Shinn, who had made a successful bid for an expansion National Basketball Association (NBA) team in Charlotte, the Charlotte Hornets. Richardson founded Richardson Sports, a partnership consisting of himself, his family, {{and a number of}} businessmen from North and South Carolina were also recruited to be limited partners. Richardson looked at four potential locations for a stadium, ultimately choosing uptown Charlotte. In choosing the team name, the Richardsons did not run focus groups with potential fans. Their intention <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> 'Panthers'; Jerry Richardson began driving a car with the license plate 'PNTHRS' near the end of 1989.|$|E

But for the majority of Irish Catholics living in the countryside, the cost of the tithing system <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> main cause of complaint.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the Temple, Rome governed Judea both through a Procurator at Caesarea, which <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> Roman provincial capital, and through a Jewish Patriarch. A former leading Pharisee, Yohanan ben Zakkai, was appointed the first Patriarch (the Hebrew word, Nasi, also means prince, or president), and he reestablished the Sanhedrin at Javneh under Pharisee control. Instead of giving tithes to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the Temple, the rabbis instructed Jews to give money to charities and study in local synagogues, as well as to pay the Fiscus Iudaicus.|$|E

25|$|Transferred nationalism: Oceania's enemy changes, and an orator changes mid-sentence. The crowd {{instantly}} transfers its hatred {{to the new}} enemy. Transferred nationalism swiftly redirects emotions {{from one}} power unit to another (for example, Communism, Pacifism, Colour Feeling and Class Feeling). It happens during Hate Week, a Party rally against the original enemy. The crowd goes wild and destroys the posters that are now against their new friend, and many say {{that they must be}} the act of an agent of their new enemy and former friend. Many of the crowd must have put up the posters before the rally but think that the state of affairs <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|E
25|$|The Qing dynasty (1644–1911) {{was founded}} by the Manchu clan Aisin Gioro in what is today Northeast China (also known as Manchuria). They were {{certainly}} not the first non-Han people to rule all of China, but the fate of these previous dynasties <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> same: they invaded; they governed; they intermarried; and eventually they merged, more or less becoming Chinese themselves. Attempts were made to keep the Manchu strain ethnically pure, although these efforts proved fruitless. The early Manchu rulers enacted various laws to isolate Manchuria from China proper (Eighteen Provinces) and Mongolia. They did {{the same for the}} Mongols: Han Chinese were prohibited from entering Mongolia and Mongols were not allowed to travel outside their own leagues. Mongols were forbidden from speaking Chinese languages or intermarrying with the Han Chinese. While over time enforcement waned, the laws still remained on the books, receiving at least token observance.|$|E
25|$|With 27.29% of the Nazarene population, for {{the first}} time Africa was the largest of the denomination's 6 global regions, with a total of 674,414 members {{reported}} (an increase of 27,370 members since 2015; and an increase of 355,072 since 2006). The USA/Canada region, which <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> largest region in the denomination ranked as second with 25.87% of the global Nazarene population, with a total church membership of 639,410 (a decrease of 8,886 members from the previous year, and a decadal decline of 13,990). In 2006 the USA/Canada region comprised 40.27% of the Nazarene population. Since 2006 the Church has grown from 1,622,669 total members, which is a net increase of 848,884 members (or 52.31% decadal growth), with the most significant growth in the past decade being in the Eurasia (increase of 242.95%), Africa (increase of 111.19%), South America (up 82.46%), Mesoamerica (up 42.18%) and Asia-Pacific (23.00%) regions.

25|$|The {{morality}} of crossing the floor, the Sultan's power {{to dismiss the}} Menteri Besar (First Minister), the validity of pre-signed undated resignation letters, {{the powers of the}} Speaker of the House and power of the Election Commission were major issues of this constitutional crisis. On 11 May 2009, the Kuala Lumpur High Court ruled that the Sultan was not constitutionally permitted to dismiss the Menteri Besar, and that Nizar <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> <b>the</b> rightful head of the state government. On 22 May 2009, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court decision, and confirmed that the Barisan Nasional which has sworn in a new chief minister and parliamentary speaker for Perak should remain in power. Furthermore, the Court of Appeal found the trial judge to have erred in confusing the issue of whether the government has lost the confidence {{of the majority of the}} house with the issue of whether the Sultan has the power to dismiss the government. However Zambry's position as Menteri Besar will not go unchallenged despite the ruling as Pakatan Rakyat leaders have indicated they intend to file an appeal.|$|E
