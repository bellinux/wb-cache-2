5|$|According to one theory, Shakespeare's {{main source}} is an earlier play—now lost—known {{today as the}} Ur-Hamlet. Possibly written by Thomas Kyd or even William Shakespeare, the Ur-Hamlet would have existed by 1589, and would have {{incorporated}} a ghost. Shakespeare's company, the Chamberlain's Men, may <b>have</b> <b>purchased</b> that play and performed a version for some time, which Shakespeare reworked. However, since no copy of the Ur-Hamlet has survived, {{it is impossible to}} compare its language and style with the known works of any of its putative authors. Consequently, there is no direct evidence that Kyd wrote it, nor any evidence that the play was not an early version of Hamlet by Shakespeare himself. This latter idea—placing Hamlet far earlier than the generally accepted date, with a much longer period of development—has attracted some support.|$|E
5|$|Steam for OS X was {{originally}} planned for release in April 2010; it was launched worldwide on May 12, 2010, following a successful beta period. In {{addition to the}} Steam client, several features were made available to developers, allowing them {{to take advantage of}} the cross-platform Source engine, and platform and network capabilities using Steamworks. Through SteamPlay, the OS X client allows players who <b>have</b> <b>purchased</b> compatible products in the Windows version to download the Mac versions at no cost, allowing them to continue playing the game on the other platform. Some third-party titles may require the user to re-purchase them to gain access to the cross-platform functionality. The Steam Cloud is cross-platform compatible. Multiplayer games can also be cross-compatible, allowing Windows and Mac players to play with each other.|$|E
5|$|Tinne bought {{multiple}} {{versions of}} the same item, often leaving them in the original tissue paper, with the original price labels and delivery dates. Many of the higher value items were never worn, possibly because Tinne did not attend functions which would allow them to be due to her husband's evening surgeries. Tinne's daughter, Alexine suggests that Emily may <b>have</b> <b>purchased</b> excess items or high value items that she did not want, to allow the shop assistants to gain commission. This view is backed up by the curator of the exhibition, Pauline Rushton, who describes Tinne's social work in organising widows' pensions or helping unmarried mothers. However, fashion author Linda Grant believes it was more likely that she just enjoyed shopping.|$|E

5|$|Bowie and {{his brother}} John were {{involved}} in a major court case in the late 1820s over land speculation. When the United States purchased the Louisiana Territory in 1803, it promised to honor all former land grant claims, and for the next 20years efforts were made to establish who owned what land. In May 1824, Congress authorized the superior courts of each territory to hear suits from those who claimed they had been overlooked. The Arkansas Superior Court received 126claims in late 1827 from residents who claimed to <b>have</b> <b>purchased</b> land in former Spanish grants from the Bowie brothers. Although the Superior Court originally confirmed most of those claims, the decisions were reversed in February 1831 after further research showed that the land had never belonged to the Bowies and that the original land grant documentation had been forged. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the reversal in 1833. When the disgruntled purchasers considered suing the Bowies, they discovered that the documents in the case had been removed from the court; left without evidence, they declined to pursue a case.|$|E

25|$|The American {{judicial}} system did not initially accept drug prohibition.
