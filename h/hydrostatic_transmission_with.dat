"December 2012 "Pumps and motors are commonly connected hydraulically to create hydrostatic drives, also known as hydrostatic transmissions. A typical hydrostatic transmission consists of a variable displacement pump and a fixed displacement motor. Maximum efficiency is typically created for the system when the motor operates at maximum volumetric displacement. The objective of this research is to determine if a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>with</b> a variable displacement motor can be more efficient than one with a fixed displacement motor. A work cycle for a Caterpillar 320 D excavator was created and the efficiency of the hydrostatic drive system, controlling the swing circuit, with a fixed displacement motor was compared to the efficiency with a variable displacement motor. A PID and an H∞ controller were designed for a position control model, as well as velocity control. It was found that while it may seem obvious to achieve maximum efficiency at maximum displacement, there are some cases where maximum efficiency is achieved at a lower displacement. It was also found that for the given work cycle, a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>with</b> a variable displacement motor can be more efficient...|$|E

40|$|The rising use of {{vehicles}} and herewith the yearly decrease in available amount {{of crude oil}} left on the earth accompanied by a continuously increasing price puts high stress on the vehicle industry. Furthermore, Humans face a growing increase in the global environmental pollution concerns and tough emission standards constrain the maximum amount {{of vehicles}} emission to reduce air pollution. All of these factors force automobile and vehicle manufactures into never-ending effort to satisfy these requirements. Hence, the development of new vehicles to further reduce fuel consumption and emission is a mandatory. The high power density of hydraulic pumps/motors and hydro-pneumatic accumulators make hydraulic technology look promising for vehicles' transmission and its integration in the automobile industry should be considered. Furthermore, a reasonable price, reliability and long life time of hydraulic units are good enough and required for this purpose. The recently developed hydrostatic units, that meet the increased requirements of high efficiency over a wide range of operation offer, new capability for hydrostatic drivelines in vehicle applications. This thesis primarily addresses the potential of hydraulic transmission for use in automobiles. The analysis and simulations assume baseline vehicle specifications and components of a mid-sized passenger car. Three hydraulic drivetrain configurations were investigated. A continuously variable <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> integrated <b>with</b> an engine controlled to operate on the ideal fuel efficiency line is first introduced. Then, a secondary controlled <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> equipped <b>with</b> conventional <b>hydrostatic</b> units and an energy recovering system working under engine on/off control strategy is also investigated. Alongside the above, an innovative series full hydraulic hybrid drivetrain, referred as “the Hydrid” and its key components are researched in detail throughout the thesis. The general architecture of the Hydrid was introduced by the Dutch organization Innas BV, replacing the mechanical <b>transmission</b> <b>with</b> a distinct series hydraulic transmission which includes innovative components such as a three port-plate hydraulic transformer, fixed displacement pump and in-wheel hydro-motors designed on the floating cup technology. A generic power management strategy of the system power flows is developed by rule based algorithm, and the most efficient power flow control for each driving pattern is established. Results of the drivetrains performance, fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions during a standard driving cycle are presented to evaluate the potential of each configuration to be applied in passenger cars...|$|R

Based on deeply analyzing the working principles and energy-saving theory of loader secondary regulating transmission system, regenerating the transmission system’s inertial energy by controlling constant-power was put forward. Considering large changes of the parameters of the transmission system and its non-linearity, a fuzzy control was adopted to control the transmission system, and the mathematical model of the system was established, then the simulations of the performance of the transmission system has been conducted.

It was an input-coupled power split <b>transmission</b> <b>with</b> a <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> used as the variable unit. Components for the IVT have been chosen based on creating a model to teach students the function and operating characteristics of an IVT. Visibility was a key to determine placement of components. The IVT cart was built to connect to a dynamometer for output power, torque, and speed measurement. The IVT was instrumented so that input torque and speed as well as hydraulic oil pressures, temperature, and pump swash plate position were monitored. The displacement of the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> is controlled by a stepper motor. Through a controller area network (CAN) system, all variables and parameters can be displayed; with a personal computer connected, data logging can be accomplished easily. Example laboratory handouts were created to streamline instruction and assess comprehension of IVT concepts. ^ A 6. 2 kW diesel engine was selected to provide power to the IVT.

40|$|Abstract The use of high {{efficiency}} engines is an unavoidable necessity in the transportation field. The reduction of gas emis-sions and the optimisation of conversion efficiency cannot be entrusted only to engine characteristics, {{but it is}} necessary to work with integrated propulsion systems, which have to manage the production and transmission of the energy in an optimal way. In this paper a hybrid propulsion system made of a parallel type hybrid engine and a hydrostatic transmis-sion is presented. The operational flexibility of the hydrostatic transmission allows the thermal engine to operate at a constant speed, hence at maximum efficiency and/or minimum emission conditions. This propulsion system was applied to the case of a “ 12 m class” bus for passenger transportation. An Italian hybrid vehicle was taken as the reference solu-tion for performance comparison and as a technical database for the vehicle design aid. Starting from the Italian laws regarding buses, the design and sizing of the propulsion group components were performed. Then, in order to verify the ability of the hybrid scheme to satisfy the design targets, a simulation of the system was carried out using a dynamic simulation code. The simulation showed that the combination of the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>with</b> the hybrid engine leads to energy savings and a pollutant reduction in comparison with the reference vehicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{computational}} model of industrial-purpose hydraulic drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines (pump and motor). Adjustable pump {{equipped with the}} pressure control unit can be run together with several adjustable hydraulic motors {{on the principle of}} three-phase hydraulic socket-outlet with high-pressure lines, drain, and drainage system. The paper considers the pressure-controlled <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>with</b> hydraulic motor as an output link. It shows a possibility to create a saving hydraulic drive using a functional tie between the adjusting parameters of the pump and hydraulic motor through the pressure difference, torque, and angular rate of the hydraulic motor shaft rotation. The programmable logic controller can implement such tie. The Coulomb and viscous frictions are taken into consideration when developing a computational model of the hydraulic volume displacement drive. Discharge balance considers external and internal leakages in equivalent clearances of hydraulic machines, as well as compression loss volume caused by hydraulic fluid compressibility and deformation of pipe walls. To correct dynamic properties of hydraulic drive, the paper offers that in discharge balance are included the additional regulated external leakages in the open circuit of hydraulic drive and regulated internal leakages in the closed-loop circuit. Generalized differential equations having functional multipliers and multilinked nature have been obtained to describe the operation of hydraulic positioning and speed drive with two hydraulic volume adjustable working chamber machines. It is shown that a proposed computational model of hydraulic drive can be taken into consideration in development of LS («Load-Sensing») drives, in which the pumping pressure is tuned to the value required for the most loaded slave motor to overcome the load. Results attained can be used both in designing the industrial-purpose heavy-duty hydraulic drives with improved adjusting characteristics and in creating the multilink hydraulic drives to work with the centralized powers sources of restricted power...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A Dynamic Hydromachine Control {{concept is}} {{presented}} here with specific application as a specialized transmission for a heavy vehicle, which would provide such a vehicle with good mobility and good {{ride and handling}} characteristics {{as well as the}} provision of a large torque/speed range which is essential for multi purpose vehicles. Dynamic Hydromachine Control is a term given to a hydrostatic transmission which is subjected to both primary unit dynamic pressure control and secondary unit dynamic speed control, so as to obtain an extremely versatile <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>with</b> unique characteristics. The Dynamic Hydromachine Control concept is realized by a digital Transmission Control Computer and analogue controllers, which interpret the operator/driver inputs and generate control signals for the hydromachines according to a Control Law, which is petrol engine speed dependent. This control strategy ensures that the petrol engine cannot stall (nor overspeed for long periods) and it would also provide a vehicle with handling characteristics similar to those of a conventional vehicle with an automatic transmission. The Control Law may be operated in three main modes, namely those of normal differential action (with limited wheel slip control capability), differential lock action or forced steering action. The Dynamic Hydromachine Control concept has been evaluated on an experimental power train, the hydrostatic transmission of which is to be directly implemented in a technology demonstrator vehicle (at a later stage of the research program). The hydromachines have been dimensioned (in terms of torque and speed) so as to fulfil the functional requirements of the eventual technology demonstrator vehicle. No—load characterisation tests as well as vehicle traction simulation tests were performed on the experimental hydrostatic transmission. It is shown that the system pressure, the high pressure accumulator, and the inertial loads, all have significant influences on the overall dynamic response of the system. The high pressure accumulator which is normally included in a hydraulic circuit where secondary unit speed control is performed, {{has been found to be}} redundant due to the fast and effective dynamic pressure control which is exercised. It is however this controlled variation of system pressure together with the absorbing effect of the high pressure accumulator, which cause pressure oscillations and possible system instability, thus providing further motivation for the omission of the high pressure accumulator from the final hydraulic circuit which is to be implemented in the technology demonstrator vehicle. Apart from these findings, the experimental results prove that the different operational modes of the Control Law, operate successfully under various simulated traction load conditions, thus validating the use of the Dynamic Hydromachine Control concept for multi wheeled heavy vehicles.
