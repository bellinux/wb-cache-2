At Vickers Armstrong he was the assistant chief engineer working with Barnes Wallis on variable-geometry aircraft projects that would eventually become the basis of the AFVG project. However, he resigned again after ten months, joining Folland in 1960, replacing Teddy Petter as director and chief engineer.

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in both the robotics and AI communities to give autonomous robots the ability to interact with humans. To efficiently identify properties from its environment (be it {{the presence of a}} human, or a fire extinguisher or another robot of its kind) is one of the critical tasks for supporting meaningful robot/human dialogues. This task is a particular anchoring task. Our goal is to endow autonomous mobile robots (in our experiments a Pioneer 2 DX) with a perceptual system that can efficiently adapt itself to the context so as to enable the learning task required to physically <b>ground</b> symbols. In <b>effect,</b> <b>Machine</b> Learning based approaches to provide robots with an ability to ground symbols heavily rely on ad hoc perceptual representation provided by AI designers. Our approach is in the line of meta-learning algorithms, that iteratively change representations so as to discover one that is well-fitted for the task. The architecture we propose is based on a widely used approach in constructive induction: the Wrapper-model. Experiments using the PLIC system to have a robot identify the presence of humans and fire extinguishers show the interest of such an approach that dynamically abstracts a well-fitted image description depending on the concept to learn...|$|R

40|$|Rotorcraft {{operating}} in <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> {{have been known}} to experience beneficial performance effects as well as operational difficulties during low speed forward flight. While these have been attributed to the formation of the ground induced wake, limited experimental investigations of the wake have been conducted. Difficulties in re-creating representative forward flight ground boundary conditions in wind tunnels have meant a lack of quantitative information on the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake. This research is based on experimentally investigating the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wakes of rotors in forward flight, to detail the fluid mechanics associated with the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake and to identify the influence of rotor parameters and ground boundary conditions on the formation of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) tests were conducted on wide regions of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake produced by a rotor model in a wind tunnel fitted with a moving ground. Results from this research showed the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake to consist of a flow separation boundary and a region of recirculation, formed by the rotor tip vortex system trailing along the ground plane. Unsteadiness of the wake was seen to result in a constantly evolving wake, and this was observed to affect the classification of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> flow regimes. Flow visualisation experiments conducted on the brownout phenomenon showed the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake features to influence the dust pick-up and transport mechanisms involved in the dust cloud formation. Experimental testing showed rotor parameters such as collective angles, rotor trim settings, rotor ground distance and root cut-out ratios to cause insignificant changes to the fluid mechanics of the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake, affecting only the location of the wake features. <b>Effects</b> of <b>ground</b> boundary conditions on the <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> wake fluid mechanics were observed to be most significant, affecting both the location and detailed structure of the wake features.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{characteristics}} of an aircraft may significantly differ when flying {{close to the}} ground rather than when flying up and away. Recent research has also determined that dynamic effects (i. e., sink rate) influence <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> (GE). A <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> flight test program of the F- 15 aircraft was conducted to support the propulsion controlled aircraft (PCA) program at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center. Flight data was collected for 24 landings on seven test flights. Dynamic <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> data were obtained for low- and high-sink rates, between 0. 8 and 6. 5 ft/sec, at two approach speed and flap combinations. These combinations consisted of 150 kt with the flaps down (30 deg deflection) and 170 kt with the flaps up (0 deg deflection), both with the inlet ramps in the full-up position. The aerodynamic coefficients caused by <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> were estimated from the flight data. These <b>ground</b> <b>effects</b> data were correlated with the aircraft speed, flap setting, and sink rate.

40|$|Motivated by the Sikorsky Human Powered Helicopter Challenge, {{an attempt}} to further study ground {{influence}} on a hovering rotor of highly elastic blades in extreme ground proximity has been carried out. This study presents two computational approaches for prediction of elastic blade behavior in <b>ground</b> <b>effect,</b> using finite element analysis (FEM) for deflections while modeling <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> on a blade element level. The first approach is based on classical blade element momentum theory, correcting for <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> based on empirical models. The second method uses a newly tailored rigid prescribed wake model alongside blade element analysis. As both methods account for local height off the ground at each blade element, they allow for more detailed insight regarding property distributions along the highly elastic blade in extreme <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> conditions and thus improved performance prediction capabilities. This study includes experimental results from both a rigid blade sub-scale set-up and elastic blade full scale set-up, operating in extreme <b>ground</b> <b>effect,</b> which are subsequently used to validate the proposed methods. This work concludes that careful consideration of blade deflections when modeling flexible rotor performance in extreme <b>ground</b> <b>effect</b> is key to a successful prediction capability, and thus design parameters which influence variation in thrust distribution will have an increased effect on performance in these conditions...|$|R
