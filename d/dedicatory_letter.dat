5000|$|Inglis’s {{career was}} first managed by her father, who wrote dedicatory verses for her early books. After Inglis married Bartholomew Kello in 1596, {{he began to}} assist her instead. Kello {{sometimes}} wrote <b>dedicatory</b> <b>letters</b> and poems praising the recipients of Inglis’s works, as well as Inglis herself, being so proud of her skills that he’d often sign himself as “husband of the book’s adorner” in the book. The marriage occurred after her “graduation” from her homeschooled lifestyle, which was a common theme among women intellectuals during this time period. Kello worked as a clerk for James VI’s court, upon which Inglis seems to have worked as Kello’s scribe, though other research seems to claim that King James VI employed both as scriveners.

40|$|How does John Calvin {{view the}} book of the Acts of the Apostles? What does he see as the benefit of this book for the church of his time? Is he, like so many today, of the opinion that {{the book of}} Acts is {{primarily}} about the work of the Holy Spirit? Calvin preached and commented on the book of Acts from 1549 to 1554. His commentary is preceded by an Argumentum {{as well as a number}} of <b>dedicatory</b> <b>letters</b> (accompanying the respective editions). In these introductory documents Calvin gives the reader insight into his view on the benefit and the theme of Acts. He describes the benefit of the book of Acts primarily from a Christological perspective: the book of Acts paints a picture of the effect that Christ’s death and resurrection had after he ascended into heaven. This benefit takes its most visible form in the theme of Acts, which Calvin subsequently identifies: the beginning of the church. The theme of the book of Acts is therefore defined from an ecclesiological perspective. This article demonstrates the value of studying not only Calvin’s commentaries themselves, but also the introductory documents that accompanied them. In this way, a clear picture of Calvin’s view on the book of Acts is painted...|$|R

In that framework, thiw paper examines the publishing and editorial methods that were used from printers – publishers of that period in their attempt to satisfy and acknowledge those special readers–users. It also attempts to explain the reasons for this particular publishing policy. The methods concern the content and the book as printed material and as object of art. Publishing methods, related to all the copies of the tirage, were the prologues, the <b>dedicatory</b> <b>letters</b> or poems, and the introductions. Techniques related to one only, special copy, which was often offered as a present, were the unique binding and hand-illumination. Those expensive, luxury copies express the influence of the manuscript tradition. Some of the used methods concerned part of the tirage, such as title pages with different name of sponsor or different dedication, according to the person for whom the copy or the copies were to be given. The methods mentioned above demonstrate the ideological and aesthetical usages of the printed book, {{while at the same time}} express the relationship between men of letters and editions, on the one hand, and men of political and religious power, on the other. Furthermore, it is of special interest that these particular methods, adapted to modern needs and expectations, are used nowadays by the publishing industry...|$|R

40|$|According to the OED {{the word}} ‘phraseology’ was last {{used in the}} since-then {{obsolete}} sense “a collection or handbook of the phrases or idioms of a language; a phrasebook” {{in the title of}} Baretti’s Easy Phraseology (1775), which, despite the sense attributed to its title, is neither ‘a collection of phrases or idioms’ nor ‘a phrasebook’, i. e. “a small book containing useful or idiomatic expressions in a foreign language […] with explanations or translations of their meaning” (OED, s. v. phrasebook, sense A). In fact, it is rather ‘big’ (424 pages) and its 56 fictitious dialogues, purposefully compiled to teach Italian, are not meant to illustrate phrases or idioms specifically, but rather to present “dieci o dodicimila vocaboli” (p. 10), thus lexis in general, alongside a few morpho-syntactic structures and phonological aspects. However, Baretti’s Easy Phraseology is indeed rich in ‘explanations and translations’ of idiomatic and culture-specific expressions (the way in which ‘mannaggia’ is translated is linguistically quite interesting) and especially of proverbs, often meta-linguistically introduced by “the proverb says”. Proverbs are quite revealing about various cultural aspects (Iamartino 1994) and their very didactic nature (Knappe 2004) gives them a special position within phraseology. Some 35 years later the word ‘phraseology’ was juxtaposed with the words ‘Idioms’ and ‘Genius’ in the title of a very rarely cited different type of didactic material, Duverger’s dictionary (1810 ?) of English and French “modes of expressions adopted by the higher classes”, where it is used in a surprisingly modern sense (Nuccorini, 2008) which is paradoxically closer to the above-reported OED obsolete definition. A few culture-bound expressions from the two works, which share the same pedagogical aim and social views clearly presented in their respective <b>Dedicatory</b> <b>Letters,</b> will be analysed to show how they account for the different senses in which the word ‘phraseology’ was used across a short time span. For example the typical manners and customs of Italy ironically illustrated in Baretti’s “Dialogue the twentieth” are quite revealing of the author’s notion of phraseology and its links with cultural aspects as is, in a rather different way, the cliché “a man blessed with a good wife, with fine children” which illustrates the use of ‘blessed’ in Duverger’s dictionary...|$|R

40|$|My PhD {{dissertation}} aims to gain {{an understanding}} of the manifestation of life writing in France {{at the turn of the}} Enlightenment, and more specifically of the discursive features and culturally anchored assumptions it exhibits with regard to autobiographical narration. In order to describe how French autobiographers negotiated the appearance of their private lives on the public stage, a discursive analysis of a wide range of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century French autobiographical writings has been carried out. More in particular, I examined whether the scenography of death could have functioned as a discursive strategy that served both the purposes of legitimizing and accrediting autobiographical writings. Over the last decades, substantial research has been devoted to the subject of defining autobiography in relation to neighboring genres such as memoirs, diaries and other confessional narratives. However, there has been relatively little analysis of how autobiographical writings  ego-documents, so to speak &# 8722; actually function in their broader discursive context. In fact, would it not be useful to temporarily put aside an approach that strives to define autobiography as a genre corresponding to well-defined poetic and recognizable premises? Therefore, my dissertation aims to examine to what extent (early) modern autobiography is the result of a process of constant interaction and negotiation with the social, historical and discursive context in which it appears, in order to circumvent what I would like to call an autobiographical taboo. My initial hypothesis is that all those who strived to unveil their private lives to the eyes of the public in the French (pre) modern period had to negotiate their appearance on the public stage in order to circumvent a taboo that weighed heavily on discourses of the self. Hence, the approach taken in this article is pragmatic rather than essentialist. As opposed to an essentialist approach aiming to define autobiography, my primary concern lies with exploring the extent to which the sentiment of transgressive unveiling was entangled with private testimony. Regarding the fact that the eighteenth century is generally described as the key period of development of first-person literary texts, it may seem rather contradictory to state that in the field of French literature, the use of first-person narration was problematic at that time. Nevertheless, the very choice of writing stories in the first person without the purpose of religious edification implies a secular vision of the human condition that was not yet entirely established at the turn of the eighteenth century. As a result, personal narrative has been negatively connoted and deemed inappropriate over the centuries. The literary history of life-writing in France is thus one of conflict and upheaval in response to the overall domination of the public opinion (doxa). In order to circumvent this taboo, most of the (early) modern autobiographers tried to establish a pact with thereader that served the purpose of legitimizing the manifestation of their inner lives in the public arena. For that, they had at their disposal a vast arsenal of discursive strategies. It is precisely in the sense of a negotiation with the public that I will elaborate on the notion of a pact, in contrast to Philippe Lejeunes stricter definition of the term in Le pacte autobiographique (1975). Without diminishing the merits of this seminal work, I believe that the meaningful intensity of the notion of pact can be renewed by confronting it with its opposite: the autobiographical taboo. In other words, the purpose of the pact, elaborated through certain discursive strategies, is to legitimize and accredit the enunciation of discourses of the self, which means negotiating the emergence of this kind of discourse in the public sphere. This double preoccupation with the legitimation and accreditation of autobiographical discourse constitutes, in my opinion, the main axis of tension around which the very enterprise of enunciation of the self has been articulated for centuries. It is precisely the recurrence of certain discursive strategies  which turns them into topoi  and the argument they carry for accreditation and/or legitimation of the enunciation of the self, that constitute the response to an underlying tension in autobiographical discourse. In other words, the taboo manifests itself through the omnipresence of the accreditation and legitimation apparatus that has framed and accompanied the enunciation of the self for centuries. I believe that it is only in relation to this discursive context that autobiographical discourse itself, which lies at the center of this complex web of relations, can be understood. It is important to state that in no way do I claim to hold the truth of how the public interpreted and responded to the mentioned works when they were published. My objective is limited to circumscribing, from my own readings of the material, some potential strategies of autobiographical discourse concerning literary legitimation and accreditation. Moreover, my reading first looks to paratexts accompanying autobiographical productions (prefaces, postfaces, <b>dedicatory</b> <b>letters,</b> notes to the reader, etc.) and incipits, which, like paratexts, constitute truly strategic moments where the author communicates his meta-literary reflections and maps out the autobiographical project for the reader. Therefore it is precisely in these moments that implicit or explicit references to the existence of an autobiographical taboo are most likely to be found. nrpages: 424 status: publishe...|$|R
