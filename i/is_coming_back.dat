Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show.

When I read that [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back.</b> Everyone said yes." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Canada, Coronation Street is {{broadcast}} on CBC Television. Until 2011, episodes were shown in Canada approximately 10 months after they aired in Britain; however, {{beginning in the}} fall of 2011, the CBC began showing two episodes every weekday, in order {{to catch up with the}} ITV showings, at 6:30pm and 7pm local time Monday-Friday, with an omnibus on Sundays at 7.30am. By May 2014, the CBC was only two weeks behind Britain, so the show was reduced to a single showing weeknights at 6:30pm local time. The show debuted on Toronto's CBLT in July 1966. The 2002 edition of the Guinness Book of Records recognises the 1,144 episodes sold to the now-defunct CBC-owned Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, TV station CBKST by Granada TV on 31 May 1971 to be the largest number of TV shows ever purchased in one transaction. The show traditionally aired on weekday afternoons in Canada, with a Sunday morning omnibus. [...] In 2004, CBC moved the weekday airings from their daytime slot to prime time. In light of austerity measures imposed on the CBC in 2012, which includes further cutbacks on non-Canadian programming, one of the foreign shows to remain on the CBC schedule is Coronation Street, according to the CBC's director of content planning Christine Wilson, who commented: [...] "Unofficially I can tell you Coronation Street <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back.</b> If it didn't come back, something would happen on Parliament Hill." [...] Kirstine Stewart, the head of the CBC's English-language division, once remarked: [...] "Coronation Street fans are the most loyal, except maybe for curling viewers, of all CBC viewers," [...] In late September 2014, CBC aired extra episodes to become only one week behind the UK in airing of new episodes.|$|E
