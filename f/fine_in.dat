The crime of a commercial organisation failing to prevent bribery is punishable by an unlimited <b>fine.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a convicted individual or organisation may be subject to a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, while a company director who is convicted may be disqualified under the Company Directors Disqualification Act 1986.|$|E
