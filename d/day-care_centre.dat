40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the role of}} the visual environment in the overall well-being, learning and development of {{children under the age of}} three years. Seven Finnish <b>day-care</b> <b>centres</b> were studied through the concepts of visual quality and affordance. There were many well-designed features in the studied <b>day-care</b> <b>centres.</b> Yet, many of the centres could be defined as dull or boring as only a few environments provided excitement through diverse materials, meaningful display, or variable outdoor spaces. An unexpected result was that long-lasting creative play seemed underrated in the visual environments, although it has been considered as a core element in Finnish ECEC throughout its history. An interesting result was that documentation can reveal a number of affordances, especially concerning the social and associational aspects of the human environment interaction. The study provides new perspectives about the meaning of the visual environment to be reflected upon in <b>day-care</b> <b>centres,</b> especially by discussing the significance of the environment s associational aspects...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{energy balance}} {{and physical activity}} in obese preschool children attending <b>day-care</b> <b>centres.</b> Design: Cross-sectional study. Subjects: Twenty-four 3 - 5 years old obese children selected at random from four different <b>day-care</b> <b>centres</b> in Santiago City, Chile. Total energy expenditure (TEE) was measured by doubly labelled water and physical activity as recorded by TRITRAC R 3 D motion sensor. Energy intake was assessed by measuring food intake while at the centre, along with the recording of additional food intake in the home. Results: Obese children had a 5. 4 % higher weighed energy intake than their energy requirements 2001. Energy intake during the week was 7716 +/- 1092 kJ/day and 7401 +/- 1023 kJ/day in boys and girls, respectively. Minimal activity was higher in the <b>day-care</b> <b>centres</b> (62 %) compared to 52 % during the weekend at home. Light activity was higher during the weekend at home than during the week (25 versus 20 %), but moderate-intense activity was similar (3 - 5 %). Conclusions: Reduction in dietary energy provided at the <b>day-care</b> <b>centres</b> helps to balance energy requirements during the week. Obese children had marked sedentary characteristics with regards to physical activity, although children are more active at home in weekends. This situation suggests that educators and parents need to improve children's physical activity levels and nutrition habits...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the importance of}} the intestinal parasites including Cryptosporidium in children of <b>day–care</b> <b>centres</b> as a cause of enteric infections and risk of spread to close contacts of infected children. Methods: Stool samples were collected from 43 children attending the <b>day-care</b> <b>centres,</b> 10 personnel of the centres and 55 household contacts of the children. Direct smear method and then formalin-ether sedimentation method were carried out for all stool samples to detect intestinal parasites. Fecal smears were prepared from the sediment and stained by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method for the recovery of red-pink oocysts of Cryptosporidium. Results: Thirty-one (72 %) children were found to be infected for intestinal parasites compared to 1 (10 %) positive personnel and 19 (34. 5 %) positive household contacts of the children. Cryprosporidium oocysts were found to be excreted in 4 (9 %) children compared to 4 (7. 2 %) household contacts. No single positive case was recovered among the examined personnel of the <b>day-care</b> <b>centres.</b> Conclusion: The present report provided useful information on the seasonal occurrence, patterns of transmission and risk of spread to close contacts of infected children. The roles of children and staff in the transmission of parasitic diseases would {{contribute to the development of}} effective prevention and control measures in child care centres...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe article {{deals with}} the problem of {{revealing}} qualities that define Russian teachers’ personal readiness to work with children while playing. This problem is topical for Russia and has not been studied well enough. The traditional stereotype of a Russian teacher was connected with strictness and exactingness. Child abuse (in the form of punishment, even physically) was unofficially considered to be a norm in family education. Isolated instances of child abuse in families and <b>day-care</b> <b>centres</b> may be observed even today. Pedagogical cooperation which was formerly recognized in the 1990 s tended to scare off educators over violations of pedagogical ethics and tact, often bordering on familiarity and lack of professionalism. The 2013 new pre-school education standard emphasizes the use of games as children's leading activity type. It actualized teachers’ qualities such as self-consciousness, empathy, colloboration, etc. As a result of it, cognitive development of children began to take a backseat. Russian school standards and programs are not as unrestricted as those in <b>day-care</b> <b>centres.</b> That is why schools are unwilling as yet to meet <b>day-care</b> <b>centres</b> halfway; instead they set down their own requirements for pre-schools (including the level of children's cognitive development) and the latter have to adapt to them. One of the forms of such adaptation is a didactic game. The research suggests that in <b>day-care</b> <b>centres</b> a game is played under a teacher's strict control. Consequently, it loses its freedom and fails to provide self-actualization to either teacher or child. Moreover, there is a different perception of the game among representatives of different religions. For example, the population of the Volga region (Kazan) consists of Russians, Tatars, Chuvashes, Maris. These peoples’ religious and national self identification is on the rise. Some of them fully approve of the games while others don’t...|$|R
