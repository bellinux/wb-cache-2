40|$|A {{collaborative}} effort between the University of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Fountain, Fillmore Co., Minnesota, {{a small town}} self-identifed as “The Sinkhole Capitol of the U. S. A.,” is located on a large sinkhole plain in the Upper Ordovician Galena Group. Recent mapping of the structural setting in the Fountain area provides new constraints for the interpretations of flow paths in springsheds defined by three decades of dye traces (Runkel, 2012, private communication). The strata of the Galena Group are deformed into a low-angle, assymetric syncline that is plunging northwest. The Fountain East dye traces, initiated in May 2012, were designed to further refine springshed boundaries on {{the northern edge of}} the sinkhole plain and to delineate source areas for cold-water springs that feed Minnesota designated trout streams in the area, particularly Rice Creek. Two major springsheds were previously mapped in the Fountain East area: the Fountain Springshed, which drains northwest and forms the headwaters for Rice Creek; and the Mahoney Springshed that drains southeast to form the headwaters for Mahoney Creek. The newest tracing efforts begin to document a new springshed to the northeast of <b>Fountain</b> <b>feeding</b> Klomp’s Spring and ultimately Rice Creek. The integration of dye trace data, structural contours, and ArcGIS imagery contextualizes the regional subsurface flow and further provides evidence for the delineation of the Fountain, Mahoney and Klomp Springsheds.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{theoretical}} {{treatment of the}} ascent, emplacement, and eruption of magma on Mars. Because of the lower gravity, fluid convective motions and crystal settling processes driven by positive and negative buoyancy forces, as well as overall diapiric ascent rates, will be slower on Mars than on Earth, permitting larger diapirs to ascend to shallower depths. This factor also favors a systematic increase in dike widths on Mars {{by a factor of}} 2 and, consequently, higher effusion rates by a factor of 5. As a result of the differences in lithospheric bulk density profile, which in turn depend on differences in both gravity and surface atmospheric pressure, magma reservoirs are expected to be deeper on Mars than on Earth, by a factor of about 4. The combination of the lower Martian gravity and lower atmospheric pressure ensures that both nucleation and disruption of magma occur at systematically greater depths than on Earth. Although lava flow heat loss processes are such that no major differences between Mars and Earth are to be expected in terms of flow cooling rates and surface textures, the lower gravity causes cooling-limited flows to be longer and dikes and vents to be wider and characterized by higher effusion rates. Taken together, these factors imply that we might expect compositionally similar cooling-limited lava flows to be about 6 times longer on Mars than on Earth. For example, a Laki type flow would have a typical length of 200 - 350 km on Mars; this would permit the construction of very large volcanoes of the order of 500 - 700 km in diameter. For strombolian eruptions on Mars the main difference is that while the large particles will remain near the vent, the finer material will be more broadly dispersed and the finest material will be carried up into a convecting cloud over the vent. This means {{that there would be a}} tendency for broader deposits of fine tephra surrounding spatter cones on Mars than on Earth. On Mars, strombolian eruption deposits should consist of cones that are slightly broader and lower relative to those on Earth, with a surrounding deposit of finer material. Martian hawaiian cones should have diameters that are about a factor of 2 larger and heights that are, correspondingly, about a factor of 4 smaller than on Earth; central craters in these edifices should also be broader on Earth by a factor of up to at least 5. Grain sizes in Martian hawaiian edifices should be at least 1 order of magnitude finer than in terrestrial equivalents because of the enhanced magma fragmentation on Mars. Differences in the atmospheric pressure and temperature structure cause Martian plinian eruption clouds to rise about 5 times higher than terrestrial clouds for the same eruption rate. Essentially the same relative shapes of eruption clouds are expected on Mars as on Earth, and so the cloud-height/deposit-width relationship should also be similar. This implies that Martian fall deposits may be recognized as areas of mantled topography with widths in the range of several tens to a few hundred kilometers. A consequence of the lower atmospheric pressure is that Martian plinian deposits of any magma composition will be systematically finer grained than those on Earth by a factor of about 100, almost entirely subcentimeter in size. Basaltic plinian eruptions, rare on Earth, should be relatively common on Mars. The production of large-scale plinian deposits may not signal the presence of more silicic compositions, but rather may be linked to the enhanced fragmentation of basaltic magma in the Martian environment or to the interaction of basaltic magma with groundwater. The occurrence of steep-sided domes, potentially formed by viscous, more silicic magma, may be largely precluded by enhanced magma fragmentation. Pyroclastic flow formation is clearly inherently more likely to occur on Mars than on Earth, since eruption cloud instability occurs at a lower mass eruption rate for a given magma volatile content. For a given initial magma volatile content, eruption speeds are a factor of at least 1. 5 higher on Mars, and so the <b>fountains</b> <b>feeding</b> pyroclastic flows will be more than twice as high as on Earth. Pyroclastic flow travel distances may be a factor of about 3 greater, leading to values up to at least a few hundred kilometers. Martian environmental conditions thus operate to modulate the various eruption styles and the morphology and morphometry of resulting landforms, providing new insight into several volcanological problems...|$|R
6000|$|Through {{the heavy}} door whose bronze network closes the place of his rest, let us enter the church itself. It is lost in still deeper twilight, to which the eye must be {{accustomed}} for some moments before {{the form of the}} building can be traced; and then there opens before us a vast cave, hewn out into the form of a Cross, and divided into shadowy aisles by many pillars. Round the domes of its roof the light enters only through narrow apertures like large stars; and here and there a ray or two from some far away casement wanders into the darkness, and casts a narrow phosphoric stream upon the waves of marble that heave and fall in a thousand colors along the floor. What else there is of light is from torches, or silver lamps, burning ceaselessly in the recesses of the chapels; the roof sheeted with gold, and the polished walls covered with alabaster, give back at every curve and angle some feeble gleaming to the flames; and the glories round the heads of the sculptured saints flash out upon us as we pass them, and sink again into the gloom. Under foot and over head, a continual succession of crowded imagery, one picture passing into another, as in a dream; forms beautiful and terrible mixed together; dragons and serpents, and ravening beasts of prey, and graceful birds that in the midst of them drink from running <b>fountains</b> and <b>feed</b> from vases of crystal; the passions and the pleasures of human life symbolized together, and the mystery of its redemption; for the mazes of interwoven lines and changeful pictures lead always at last to the Cross, lifted and carved in every place and upon every stone; sometimes with the serpent of eternity wrapt round it, sometimes with doves beneath its arms, and sweet herbage growing forth from its feet; but conspicuous most of all on the great rood that crosses the church before the altar, raised in bright blazonry against the shadow of the apse. And although in the recesses of the aisles and chapels, when the mist of the incense hangs heavily, we may see continually a figure traced in faint lines upon their marble, a woman standing with her eyes raised to heaven, and the inscription above her, [...] "Mother of God," [...] she is not here the presiding deity. It is the Cross that is first seen, and always, burning in the centre of the temple; and every dome and hollow of its roof has the figure of Christ in the utmost height of it, raised in power, or returning in judgment.|$|R
40|$|Animals in grazing work as {{catalyst}} in {{the nutrient}} cycling {{processes of the}} ecosystems. Part of biomass that animal intake returning to soil in the degraded way like faeces and urine. The return is around 90 % of the mineral nutrients, including nitrogen. However, {{it is necessary to}} know how these dejects are distributed on the area by animals. The environment management affects directly spatial distribution of these dejects. Drinking <b>fountain,</b> salt and <b>feed</b> trough, portress, rest area and shadow are structures that change the way that animal graze. Sward structure and herbage morphology affect the grazing behaviour as well. So, the objective this experiment was evaluate the spatial distribution of dung from dairy heifers in integrated systems of production at Mato Grosso, Brazil. The experiment was accomplished at Embrapa (Sinop/Mato Grosso/ Brazil). The experimental area was 10 ha divided in three systems: full sun, marginal shadowing (300 trees per ha) and intensive shadowing (750 trees per ha). Each system had different sizes, but 2. 4 ha was useful area for all systems divided in 10 paddocks each. The tree used was Eucalyptus urograndis, H 13 clone and the pasture was piata Grass (Urochloa brizantha). The grazing was done when the sward reached 95 % light interception. It was evaluated a group of 24 breed heifers with 350 kg in three periods of year. Each paddock was divided in 25 grids for count of faeces boards. The spatial faeces distribution was evaluated with GPS, by walking and capturing points where there was faeces boards in all steps for the grassland paddocks, in three periods of year (rainy, rainy-drought transition and dry period). The dataset was analysed by SAS 9. 2 version, using PROC MIXED and PDIFF to 5 % of significance. The spatial distribution of dung had significant difference only in rainy-drought transition period (P= 0. 0165) and interaction effect between shadowing and site (P= 0. 0025) in this period of year and dry period as well (P= 0. 0465). In both periods, the distribution was the same. The full sun system promoted more concentration of faeces boards in sites next portress and border fence in site opposite to portress. In marginal shadowing system, the major concentration was in the central area and under shadow. In intensive shadowing system, the major concentration of dung boards was under shadow, sites preferred by heifers for rumination and leisure activities. The kind of shade and the year periods affected in spatial dung distribution. There were places with more dung concentration, in all kind of shade, but when the pasture had the intensive shade, the dispersion was more homogeneous. Unlike expected, the dung deposition didn?t happens only under treetops. The distribution is more homogeneous when trees are in large quantities. The shadow area available in the grassland affected the spatial dung distribution, and can be more homogeneous than no shadow. 201...|$|R
