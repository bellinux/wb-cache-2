5000|$|The oboe da caccia has a leather-covered wooden body {{terminating}} in a {{large wooden}} bell, {{or in the case}} of Eichentopf's instruments, a flaring brass bell as pictured above. There are typically two brass keys, E-flat and C. The E-flat key is normally doubled for the left hand. There are usually two twin fingerholes, G/A-flat and F/F#, similar to the soprano baroque oboe. The construction differs from that of practically all other woodwinds. The bore and outward profiles are first created on the lathe, then a series of saw <b>kerfs</b> are made through the bore from the side, which is to become the inner curve. Then the instrument is bent over steam and a slat glued onto the inside curve to fix it. Any remaining lacunae in the <b>kerfs</b> are filled and the curved section is covered with leather. The da caccia is played with a double reed; the sound is very mellow and supple.|$|E
5000|$|Kerf: The {{narrow channel}} {{left behind by}} the saw, and (relatedly) the measure of its width, which depends on several factors: the width of the saw blade; the set of the blade's teeth; the amount of wobble created during cutting; and the amount of {{material}} pulled out of the sides of the cut. Although the term [...] "kerf" [...] is often used informally, to refer simply to the thickness of the saw blade, or to the width of the set, this can be misleading, because blades with the same thickness and set may create different <b>kerfs.</b> For example, a too-thin blade can cause excessive wobble, creating a wider-than-expected kerf. The kerf created by a given blade can be changed by adjusting the set of its teeth with a tool called a saw tooth setter.|$|E

The first sequence is the descending sequence im(f), im(f 2), im(f 3),..., the second sequence is the ascending sequence <b>ker(f),</b> <b>ker(f</b> 2), <b>ker(f</b> 3),.... Because M has finite length, the first sequence cannot be strictly decreasing forever, so there exists some n with im(f n) = im(f n+1). Likewise (as M has finite length) the second sequence cannot be strictly increasing forever, so there exists some m with <b>ker(f</b> m) = <b>ker(f</b> m+1). It is easily seen that im(f n) = im(f n+1) yields im(f n) = im(f n+1) = im(f n+2) = ..., and that <b>ker(f</b> m) = <b>ker(f</b> m+1) yields <b>ker(f</b> m) = <b>ker(f</b> m+1) = <b>ker(f</b> m+2) = ... Putting k = max(m,n [...] ), it now follows that im(f k) = im(f 2k) and <b>ker(f</b> k) = <b>ker(f</b> 2k). Hence, [...] (because every [...] satisfies [...] for some [...] but also , so that , therefore [...] and thus [...] ) and [...] (since for every , there exists some [...] such that [...] (since [...] ), and thus , so that [...] and thus [...] ). Consequently, M is the direct sum of im(f k) and <b>ker(f</b> k). Because M is indecomposable, {{one of those two}} summands must be equal to M, and the other must be equal to {0}. Depending on which of the two summands is zero, we find that f is bijective or nilpotent.|$|R

The thesis discuss the experimental analysis to predict the effect of the process parameter on <b>kerf</b> width and taper on acrylic sheet. The work piece {{that we are going to}} use in the experiment is acrylic sheet that is also known by trade names such as Plexiglas, Acrylite, and Lucite which is commonly used in industry. This material is great for glazing, windows, cutting boards, or anywhere a clear material is needed.

The specimen is cut in square shape then a slit is made through the center of specimen to determine the <b>kerf</b> width and taper. From the results, it is observed that the parameter set in the experiment on laser beam cutting had effect on <b>kerf</b> width and taper. Secondly, the cuffing speed, nozzle gap and laser power gives major impact on <b>kerf</b> width and taper. The <b>kerf</b> width and taper will increase considerably with the increase of laser power and nozzle gap and decreasing the cutting speed. The cutting angle and air pressure also gives some effect on <b>kerf</b> width and taper. Increasing cutting angle and air pressure will slightly increase the <b>kerf</b> width and taper.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{transducers}} {{have been}} widely used in the medical applications. High frequency array transducers have recently attracted many research interests, since it provides not only the electronic beamforming but also the very fine image resolution. The transducers are usually either annular or linear arrays. This study concentrates on the design of both types of array in high frequency applications. The annular array is firstly investigated, and an optimized design of array geometry is developed including the <b>kerfs</b> influence which is usually neglected in the design of high frequency arrays. The improved imaging performance is found by this optimized design. More interestingly, the conventional annular array with element having the same surface area has a relatively large sidelobe closest to the main lobe. Two methods are applied to suppress the sidelobe. The method of using high-impedance single matching to enlarge the element bandwidth only shows very limited lobe suppression, however, a novel matching approach is found. Another method of changing the array geometry from equal area elements to equal width ones successfully suppressed the sidelobe. The imaging results suggest that the novel equal width array shows a good improvement. The linear array is then analyzed. The <b>kerfs</b> influence again is found to be significant for the array especially for high frequency. It is essential to use a high attenuated <b>kerfs</b> material in the linear array design. More importantly, the limitation of current fabrication techniques forces the linear array to concede a high grating lobe in the imaging field if it operates in a relatively high frequency. A novel linear array is developed to suppress the grating lobe without using advanced fabrication techniques. The imaging results show that the novel linear array has a general reduction of - 6 dB for the lobe suppression. The novel design made the linear array operate in a very high frequency without strong grating lobe, and the array can be fabricated by current techniques.

40|$|Cut mark {{analysis}} {{to date has}} been intermittently and superficially researched {{across a range of}} disciplines, despite its potential to significantly contribute to criminal investigation. The current study aims to elucidate cut mark analysis by proposing a novel classification system for the identification of knife cuts (<b>kerfs)</b> in bone. The system was devised, to record accurate and reliable information about cut marks and the criteria were tested for association with the knives that created them. Optical Microscopy was used to examine knife cuts on fleshed porcine bone. Incised cuts were made by a range of serrated, scalloped and fine-edged blades (n= 9), by the author, and participants (n= 23) were recruited to make marks on bone under the same force-measured conditions, using the Kistler force plate and a bespoke frame to control the level of height to which the knife can be raised above the bone prior to impact. Resultant <b>kerfs</b> were created by a single operator (n= 86) and created by a range of individuals (n= 186). The data suggests that consistent force was not achieved and the resultant marks on the bones made by the same knife had wide variation in their appearance and depth. The classification criteria tested did not provide discrete identification of knife blades from the assessment of kerf features; however, trends were identified from criteria including margin regularity, margin definition, floor width and wall gradient, which may form the basis for further investigation. Marks made by a single operator showed more significant associations (p< 0. 05) than group operators, and although <b>kerfs</b> from each share some trends, several significant relationships observed in marks made by a single operator are not shared by the participant group. Limitations of using optical microscopy included the inability to view all aspects of each mark, particularly when combined with variation in depth and angle produced by human operators. From the present results, it is suggested that the use of digital microscopy with a superior ability to build three dimensional images of indented marks would provide the necessary step forward to improve discrimination between knife classifications, based on the areas highlighted by the current research. This reinforces the need for further understanding of the mechanics of cut mark application in human individuals and their potential effects on kerf features...|$|E

It has been found that little research effort has been made to the AWJ cutting process for AMM laminations. As a result, the first comprehensive study on AWJ cutting of AMM laminations using various cutting techniques is presented in this thesis, with a view to understanding and improving the cutting performance, i. e. the depth of cut, the top <b>kerf</b> width and the <b>kerf</b> taper angle. An experimental study in the traditional way of AWJ operation (i. e. placing the nozzle perpendicularly to the work surface without nozzle oscillation) was carried out first to gain the basic understanding of the cutting process and cutting performance. Studies with cutting performance enhancement techniques, i. e. the nozzle oscillation and <b>kerf</b> taper compensation techniques, were then undertaken. The experimental studies included about 200 test runs to provide sufficient data for statistical analysis. Plausible trends of the cutting performance measures with respect to the process parameters have been found from the statistical analyses of the experimental data. In general, an increase in the water pressure and a decrease in the nozzle traverse speed and abrasive mass flow rate within the tested ranges increase the depth of cut. An increase in the <b>kerf</b> taper compensation angle decreases the <b>kerf</b> taper angle almost linearly. Nozzle oscillation cutting can reduce the <b>kerf</b> taper angle to less than 1 o, and the <b>kerf</b> taper compensation cutting technique can eliminate the <b>kerf</b> taper if the process parameters are properly selected. Recommendations have been made on the selection of the most appropriate process parameters to be used in practice for each cutting technique. Predictive models for the various cutting performance measures have finally been developed. The depth of cut models were developed using the energy conservation approach, while those for the top <b>kerf</b> width and <b>kerf</b> taper angle were developed empirically.

40|$|The present {{research}} examined {{the features that}} may differentiate cuts made in bone by mechanical and hand-powered saws, specifically investigating the characteristics of commercially available reciprocating saws. The partial limbs of adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) were used {{as a proxy for}} human remains, and were cut using five commercially available reciprocating saw blades and a hand-powered hacksaw. The reciprocating blades tested ranged from five teeth-per-inch to 14 / 18 teeth-per-inch and included raker, alternating, and wavy tooth sets. The hacksaw blade had 32 teeth-per-inch, with wavy set teeth. All the blades examined were intended to cut wood, metal, or both materials. The resulting false start <b>kerfs</b> and complete <b>kerfs</b> on the remains were then examined macroscopically and microscopically. The present study utilized both qualitative and quantitative analysis to examine kerf features that characterize reciprocating saws. The presentation of specific features within the kerf varied based upon blade properties, how the implement was powered, and how it was wielded in reference to the material. The {{results of the present study}} demonstrated that significant differences do exist between reciprocating saw blades. Kerf characteristics in which significant differences were noted include: kerf false start (cross section) shape, frequency of cut surface drift, presence of harmonics, striation regularity, and exit chipping size. Inter-blade differences generally reflect class characteristics previously established for hand-powered blades, though reciprocating blades do not strictly follow these categorizations (Symes 1992; Symes et al. 1998, 2010). Identification of inter-blade differences allows the limited identification of sub-classes within reciprocating saws based on the above characteristics, though blades cannot be uniquely identified.

40|$|This project {{examined}} the effects of burning on saw mark characteristics of isolated semi-fleshed white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) long bones as a substitute for human remains. Different classes of saws were examined to determine which type of saw mark characteristics are obliterated when burned and which are not. The saw mark characteristics that were examined are superficial false start scratches, false start <b>kerfs,</b> and completely sectioned cuts with breakaway spurs/notches. The long bones were burned at the Boston University School of Medicine using a muffle furnace, at differing temperatures and at differing time increments. The author hypothesized that the higher the temperature and the longer the duration of bone burning, the greater will be the obliterative effect on saw mark characteristics. All samples were examined using a Motic® Digital Light Microscope 12 VDC with a Nikon® MKII Fiber Optic Light attached with accompanying Motic® imaging and measuring software. Distances were measured between striations on complete cuts, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths using the Motic® imaging and measuring software. Images were also taken of the cross sections of the kerf floors. The striations on the kerf walls, false start kerf widths, and false start scratch widths were compared to the control samples. Measurements taken from false start scratches, false start <b>kerfs,</b> and complete cuts were averaged and compared to the averages from each temperature and the control samples, to assess the degree of shrinkage from thermal alteration. The false start kerf profile shapes were blindly examined and classified into Class A, B, C, or D(following the system of Symes 1992) and compared to the control samples. Kerf flare and blade drift were examined to determine if thermal alteration obliterated those saw mark characteristics. The chainsaw false start <b>kerfs</b> and complete cuts were examined macroscopically to determine what effects thermal alteration had on those types of marks. All thermally altered samples were assessed for color change, heat-related fracturing, and whether or not the saw marks were still visible. The author found that all saw marks made with the mitre saw, crosscut saw, and bow saw were still visible and identifiable, even in a fractured state and, when burned up to 700 °C for one hour. Most of the false start kerf samples were classified into the correct kerf profile shape as outlines in Symes (1992). False start <b>kerfs</b> and complete cuts made with the chainsaw were blindly examined and showed that these marks are distinct and easily identifiable when the bone is completely intact or has very minimal fracturing. The crosscut saw false start scratch and crosscut saw complete cut samples showed signs of shrinkage. The average width of the false start scratch samples burned at 700 °C for one hour was about 50 % smaller than the control sample's average width. The same was true for the complete cut striation widths. Shrinkage did not appear to alter the crosscut saw false start kerf widths or the bow saw false start scratch widths. For all cuts made with the mitre saw shrinkage did appear to alter the samples. Warping did occur where some of the burned averages were larger than the control sample averages. This suggests that some warping did take place by widening the kerf, thus changing the analysis of the saw mark characteristics. Blade drift and kerf flare were seen in the samples and thus were not affected by thermal alteration. The author's hypothesis was not rejected, because in some cases thermal alteration did modify the saw mark characteristic measurements and in some cases thermal alteration did not alter the measurements. Some of the saw marks were affected by shrinkage, while others were not. False start kerf profile shape classification was not affected by thermal alteration. The chainsaw samples were affected most by the thermal alteration, because of the obliterative effects of heat-related fracturing which progressed generally with the greater temperature...|$|E

The both cut qaulity parameters are analyzed and graph were plloted between feed rate versus cut quality. From the graph, reelationship between feed rate and cut quality were discused. As a result, increasing feed rate led to increasing on surface roughness and the <b>kerf</b> width decrease when the feed rate increase. The {{top and bottom surfaces}} of the acrylic specimen indicated that the top <b>kerf</b> width was slightly larger than the bottom <b>kerf</b> width. For get good cut quality, surface roughness and <b>kerf</b> width are kept at minimum value. From the result, it can conclude that feed rate has effect on surface roughness and <b>kerf</b> widt quality. To obtain better result, the experiment is able to improve in term use another method to analyzed result and consider more parameter that can effect the cut quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Design of {{experiment}} uses {{a series of}} structured analytic method to investigate the relation between parameters and the responses. The particular technique {{used in this study}} is response surface methodology. Using the DOE approach, a mathematical based model was developed through regression analysis to study the response prediction. It is found that for <b>kerf</b> width the cutting speed plays an important role. Only a high cutting speed can produce good <b>kerf</b> width. When considering the interaction between the parameters, duty cycle directly depends on frequency where a high duty cycle is needed for high frequency cutting and vice versa to obtain a good <b>kerf</b> width. Index Term — low carbon steel (EN 32), response surface methodology, cutting speed, frequency, duty cycle, <b>kerf</b> width, dimensional accuracy...|$|R
