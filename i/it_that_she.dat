5|$|Kogălniceanu's nephew, Grigore, {{himself a}} local {{leader of the}} Conservative Party and a major landowner, married to Adela Cantacuzino-Pașcanu, {{a member of the}} Cantacuzino family. He died in 1904, leaving his wife a large fortune, which she spent on a large {{collection}} of jewels and fortune-telling séances. Adela Kogălniceanu was robbed and murdered in October 1920; rumor had <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had been killed by her own son, but this path was never pursued by authorities, who were quick to cancel the investigation (at the time, they were faced with the major strikes of 1920).|$|E

25|$|As {{the show}} begins, Peyton's boyfriend is Nathan Scott. She soon breaks {{up with him}} and {{falls in love with}} Nathan's rival and half-brother, Lucas Scott. Peyton drives a 1963 Mercury Comet convertible, which becomes a major plot point as it is because of <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> meets and first speaks to Lucas.|$|E

For example, <b>it</b> stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> won all of the events she entered at the 1932 Olympic games when in fact she won two of the three. <b>It</b> stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> graduated from high school; she did not. And <b>it</b> stated <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not smoke, which is also not true.|$|R
25|$|Later, Sarah {{gave birth}} to Isaac, and {{the tension between the}} women returned. At a celebration after Isaac was weaned, Sarah found the teenage Ishmael mocking her son. She was so upset by <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> demanded that Abraham send Hagar and her son away. She {{declared}} that Ishmael would not share in Isaac's inheritance. Abraham was greatly distressed but God told Abraham to do as his wife commanded because God's promise would be carried out through both Isaac and Ishmael.|$|E
25|$|When she {{was three}} months old, she was found by a {{physician}} called Dr. Séguin, who arranged {{for her to be}} adopted by Henry Fox, 4th Baron Holland, and his wife, the former Lady Mary Coventry. Lord and Lady Holland had no biological children of their own, having gone through two stillbirths and one short-lived child. Lady Holland was in her late thirties and Lord Holland insisted on adopting the girl. Her biological paternity remains a mystery; one rumour had <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was her adoptive father's biological daughter born by his servant.|$|E
25|$|Sir James Lowther, after {{changing}} {{a piece of}} silver in George's Coffee House, and paying twopence for his dish of coffee, was helped into his chariot (for he was then very old and infirm), and went home; some little time after {{he returned to the}} same coffee house on purpose to acquaint the woman who kept <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had given him a bad halfpenny, and demanded another in exchange for it. Sir James had about forty thousand pounds per annum, and was at a loss whom to appoint his heir.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> appears <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{is based}} on a 4-wheeled coach dating from 1882. As there is no {{evidence}} of this type recorded in use post-grouping, <b>it</b> seems likely <b>that</b> <b>she</b> moved to Sodor before 1923.|$|R

25|$|Legend {{has it that}} a {{long time}} ago a big {{fortress}} stood upon Hesselberg. In that castle there lived a lord and his only daughter. The girl kept the house and had the keys for all the rooms. At that time the Huns invaded the Hesselberg region, they burnt down the castle and the girl died within the ruins. Legend has <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> still haunts the mountain carrying her bunch of keys on her belt. She is seen mostly in Saturday night after the four Ember days.|$|E
25|$|When Alice Liddell {{was a young}} woman, she {{set out on a}} grand tour of Europe with Lorina and Edith. One {{story has}} <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> became a romantic {{interest}} of Prince Leopold, the youngest son of Queen Victoria, during the four years he spent at Christ Church, but the evidence for this is sparse. It is true that years later, Leopold named his first child Alice, and acted as godfather to Alice's second son Leopold. (A recent biographer of Leopold suggests it is far more likely that Alice's sister Edith was the true recipient of Leopold's attention.) Edith died on 26 June 1876, possibly of measles or peritonitis (accounts differ), shortly before she was to be married to Aubrey Harcourt, a cricket player. At her funeral on 30 June 1876, Prince Leopold served as a pall-bearer.|$|E

I am sure I don't know why <b>it</b> is <b>that</b> <b>she</b> should have taken such an aversion to me.

500|$|It {{is often}} claimed that, despite its graphic nature, the [...] "shower scene" [...] never once shows a knife {{puncturing}} flesh. However, a {{frame by frame}} analysis of the sequence shows one shot in which the knife appears to penetrate Leigh's abdomen, but the effect may have been created by lighting and reverse motion. Leigh herself was so affected by this scene when she saw <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> no longer took showers unless she absolutely had to; she would lock all {{the doors and windows}} and would leave the bathroom and shower door open. She never realized until she first watched the film [...] "how vulnerable and defenseless one is".|$|E
500|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the First World War on 4 August 1914, David rejoined his regiment and was soon in France. [...] In May 1915, Clement, David's older brother, was killed while serving with the 10th Royal Hussars, which made David heir to the Redesdale title and lands. On 17 August 1916 Bertie Mitford died; David, still serving at the front, became the 2nd Baron Redesdale. Sydney quickly took possession of Batsford House, much of which had been shut up for many years, and occupied the portion of <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could afford to heat. The children had the run of the house and grounds, and were taught together in the schoolroom. This was a source of frustration for Nancy, whose lively intelligence required greater stimulus. She spent many hours reading in the Batsford House library where, according to Hastings, [...] the foundations of her intellectual life were laid.|$|E
500|$|In 1628, Tokugawa Hidetada, by {{then the}} retired second shogun, {{attended}} ceremonies conducted {{in honor of his}} late mother on the anniversary of her death. [...] These ceremonies were meant to help her spirit achieve buddha status. [...] He also saw to <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was made the honored tutelary patron of the temple by having her posthumous name changed and the first three characters appended to the name of the temple. [...] Today, the temple Ryūsen-ji is known mainly by that appellation, Hōdai-in (...) [...] [...] At the same time, the Emperor Go-Mizunoo conferred the name Minamoto Masako (...) upon Lady Saigō, in effect posthumously adopting her into the Minamoto clan, the extended family of the Imperial line. [...] The new name was then inducted into the Lower First Rank of the Imperial Court. [...] Her status was later upgraded to Senior First Rank, the highest and most prominent award, then or now, bestowed by the Emperor to a few subjects outside the Imperial family who had significantly and positively affected the history of Japan.|$|E

500|$|It {{was partly}} due to her urging that her husband entered {{politics}} and ran in the 1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts against incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy. [...] The race constituted her first prolonged public exposure as she campaigned for him on a nightly basis. [...] She was seen as superficial and too deferential to him and some columnists labelled her a [...] "Stepford wife". [...] Late in that campaign, she gave a long interview to The Boston Globe. [...] Her statement in <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> {{and her husband had}} never had a serious argument during their married years came in for ridicule, and her portrayal of the couple's student years as financially impoverished, while they lived off of sales of George Romney's stock and loans, made her seem privileged and naïve and brought a harsh public reaction. [...] Boston University political science professor later said, [...] "She definitely hurt him in that race." [...] Asked following her husband's loss if she would be involved in future campaigns, Ann said, [...] "Never. You couldn't pay me to do this again." [...] She later termed the experience [...] "a real education".|$|E
500|$|Lancashire's final role {{under her}} ITV {{contract}} was Gertrude Morel in {{an adaptation of}} D.H. Lawrence's 1913 novel Sons and Lovers, airing in January 2003. The portrayal–her first of a mother with adult children– followed Gertrude's transformation from a young bride into a fifty-something woman ravaged by her life experiences of poverty and domestic abuse. Lancashire re-read the novel several times prior to filming, and identified with the themes of filial and marital relationships she {{had been unable to}} appreciate as a GCSE student. The miniseries gave her a sense of conviction in her career path, stating ahead of the broadcast in 2002: [...] "whatever the reason I do what I do, I felt I had come to a point where I could stop searching after this". Reviewing the serial Paul Hoggart of The Times wrote that Lancashire [...] "steals the show" [...] with a [...] "performance of immense subtlety and quiet strength, proof, if we still needed <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has matured into a terrific actress." [...] Conversely Andrew Billen, writing in New Statesman, wrote that [...] "Sarah Lancashire was no revelation at all", purely because she had [...] "long since proved herself a formidable actress".|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{attracted}} a {{following in the}} gay subculture and was frequently imitated by female impersonators such as Tracey Lee and Charles Pierce. Attempting to explain her popularity with gay audiences, the journalist Jim Emerson wrote, [...] "Was she just a camp figurehead because her brittle, melodramatic style of acting hadn't aged well? Or was <b>it</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was 'Larger Than Life,' a tough broad who had survived? Probably some of both." ...|$|E
