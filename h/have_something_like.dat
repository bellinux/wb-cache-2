25|$|Meanwhile, {{the poet}} {{continued}} to find friends. In 1664 he was regularly commissioned and {{sworn in as}} gentleman to the duchess dowager of Orléans, and was installed in the Luxembourg. He still retained his rangership, and in 1666 we <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a reprimand from Colbert suggesting that he should look into some malpractices at Chateau Thierry. In the same year appeared the second book of the Contes, and in 1668 the first six books of the Fables, with more of both kinds in 1671. In this latter year a curious instance of the docility with which the poet lent himself to any influence was afforded by his officiating, at the instance of the Port-Royalists, as editor of a volume of sacred poetry dedicated to the Prince of Conti.|$|E
500|$|... "This Is the Day" [...] {{was taken}} from Ivy's second studio album Apartment Life which was {{released}} on October 7, 1997 by Atlantic Records. It was prominently featured in the 1998 American comedy film There's Something About Mary and was also included on the film's official soundtrack. Reflecting on its usage in the film, Durand commented that it was unimaginable to see their songs in several scenes and that she [...] "fe so grateful to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that in a movie". The song was recorded in 1997 in New York City at three different recording studios. Despite Atlantic Records signing Ivy earlier in 1997, they were later dropped and picked up by 550 Music. Following its inclusion on the film, the aforementioned label distributed the song to radio stations across the United States on October 19, 1998, in addition to releasing it as a CD single in the United States; two formats were created, with the commercial release including bonus tracks [...] "Sleeping Late" [...] and [...] "Sweet Mary" [...] and the promotional featuring just the album version of the single. Additionally, 550 Music reissued Apartment Life in the United States with new cover art and digitally remastered tracks, while both Schlesinger and Chase opened up a new recording studio titled Stratosphere in New York City in June 1999. Furthermore in the late 1990s, [...] "This Is the Day" [...] would be included on the Pepsi-issued album Pepsi Pop Culture (1998) and the 1999 compilation album titled Live a Little, Vol. 1.|$|E

"This Is the Day", the album's third single, was {{distributed}} to the public on October 19, 1998 following the band being dropped by Atlantic Records; the release was handled by 550 Music and included distribution to American radio stations and physical shipments of CD singles.

We {{did not know that}} we were living through an era - the Big Band Era - that would last only 10 years or so and be remembered and revered for ever...it's hard to believe, but the best times were packed into a five-year period from the late 1930s through the early 1940s when I sang with the bands of Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman, and Harry James. The most dramatic moments of my life were crammed into a couple of years from the fall of 1941 to the end of 1943. They seem to symbolize my life...that was when the music of the dance bands was the most popular music in the country, and I was the most popular female band singer in the country and Harry had the most popular band in the country. It didn't last long, but it sure was something while it lasted. Everyone should <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> it at least once in their lives. I'm grateful I did."

2500|$|The men {{and their}} teams {{generally}} credited {{with the creation of}} the original Thunderbird are: Lewis D. Crusoe, a retired GM executive lured out of retirement by Henry Ford II; George Walker, chief stylist and a Ford vice-president; Frank Hershey, chief stylist for Ford Division; Bill Boyer, designer Body Development Studio who became manager of Thunderbird Studio in spring of 1955, and Bill Burnett, chief engineer. Ford Designer William P. Boyer was lead stylist on the original 1955 two-seater Thunderbird and also had a hand in designing the future series of Thunderbirds including the 30th Anniversary Edition. Hershey's participation {{in the creation of the}} Thunderbird was more administrative than artistic. Crusoe and Walker met in France in October 1951. Walking in the Grand Palais in Paris, Crusoe pointed at a sports car and asked Walker, 'Why can’t we <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that?' Some versions of the story claim that Walker replied by telling Crusoe, [...] "oh, we're working on it"...although if anything existed at the time beyond casual dream-car sketches by members of the design staff, records of it have never come to light.|$|E
2500|$|Subjectivity is {{that which}} the individual—and no one else—has. But {{what does it mean}} to <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this? It cannot be {{understood}} in the same way as having a car or a bank account. It means to be someone who is becoming someone—it means being a person with a past, a present, and a future. No one can have an individual's past, present or future. Different people experience these in various ways—these experiences are unique, not anyone else's. Having a past, present, and future means that a person is an existing individual—that a person can find meaning in time and by existing. Individuals do not think themselves into existence, they are born. But once born and past a certain age, the individual begins to make choices in life; now those choices can be his, his parents', society’s, etc. The important point is that to exist, the individual must make choices—the individual must decide what to do the next moment and on into the future. What the individual chooses and how he chooses will define who and what he is—to himself and to others. Kierkegaard put it this way in Works of Love, 1847: ...|$|E
2500|$|Murray {{produced}} the pilot episode, [...] "Trash-O-Madness", at his studio in Saratoga; he animated {{half of the}} episode, and the production occurred entirely in the United States, with animation in Saratoga and processing in San Francisco. While directing during recording sessions, Murray preferred {{to be on the}} stage with the actors instead of [...] "behind glass" [...] in a control room, which he describes as [...] "the norm" [...] while making animated series. He believes that, due to his lack of experience with children, Rocko's Modern Life [...] "skewed kind of older". Murray noted, [...] "There's a lot of big kids out there. People went to see 'Roger Rabbit' and saw all these characters they'd grown up with and said, 'Yeah, why don't they <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> that anymore?'" [...] When he began producing Rocko, he says that his experience in independent films initially led him to attempt to micromanage many details in the production. He said that the approach, when used for production of television shows, was [...] "driving me crazy". This led him to allow for other team members to manage aspects of the Rocko's Modern Life production. Director and later creative director Stephen Hillenburg met Murray at an animation film festival where he was showing his three short films. Murray hired Hillenburg as a director on the series, making Hillenburg's first job in the animation business as a director.|$|E
