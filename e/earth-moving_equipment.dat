25|$|The Britannia Empress of Lima {{was on a}} {{scheduled}} flight from Honolulu Airport, Hawaii to Nadi Airport, Fiji. Shortly after take-off the crew had an engine fire warning, they feathered No. 1 engine and they jettisoned fuel before returning to Honolulu 40 minutes later. The three-engined approach appeared to be normal {{but at the last}} minute the crew decided to go-around and attempt another approach. The aircraft banked and veered to the left and the left wing tip hit the ground about 550 feet left from the center over the runway. The aircraft then disintegrated as it moved across the airfield before hitting some heavy <b>earth-moving</b> <b>equipment.</b> Apart from the rear fuselage and tail the aircraft was destroyed by fire, thirteen on board escaped but seven crew and 20 passengers were killed.|$|E
500|$|The {{railroad}} was reopened in 25 days by {{a construction}} force of one-thousand men and 175 pieces of <b>earth-moving</b> <b>equipment</b> including seven track gangs, nine bridge and building gangs, and personnel and equipment from Morrison-Knudsen. Four tunnels were quickly repaired, two more were daylighted by removing overburden to {{convert them to}} cuts, one was partially daylighted, and [...] of fill were placed to construct a [...] temporary alignment around the eighth tunnel while permanent repairs were underway.|$|E

500|$|Johnson's Cut-off was {{the only}} trail {{that could be used}} year-round, but it still had problems, as it had been built without use of <b>earth-moving</b> <b>equipment,</b> and thus did not always take the optimal route. The state adopted a survey by Sherman Day in September 1855, but failed to make use of it. Two years later, the {{counties}} of Yolo, Sacramento, and El Dorado, all of which would be benefited by further improvements, began planning and carrying out work. The state legislature created a [...] "Board of Wagon Commissioners" [...] on March 8, 1858, and it completed the improvements {{by the end of that}} year. This new route had better grades than the old cutoff, deviating from it in several places: it followed the present Smith Flat Road rather than Carson Road east of Placerville, traversed Peavine Ridge much further down the slope, returning to the river west of Kyburz (roughly via the present White Meadows Road, Ice House Road, and Weber Mill Road to US 50 at Granite Springs Road), and crossed into Carson Valley via Luther Pass. By 1860, the immense traffic over the road and lack of maintenance had worsened it to the point that it could no longer be used by stagecoaches.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is often}} {{necessary}} to fragment the overburden {{by use of}} explosives.

2500|$|The {{high winds}} of the {{blizzard}} packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached [...] in places; normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and <b>earth-moving</b> <b>equipment,</b> such as front-end loaders, {{had to be}} used. Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the [...] "snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless {{on most of the}} roads". NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used [...] "to dig away at it and break it up like big hunks of rock". In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut. The long cleanup period included the railroads, who used front-end loaders to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail.|$|E
2500|$|In January 1966, Nido, {{approached}} Maj. Gen. Winston P. Wilson, Chief of the National Guard Bureau, {{inquired about}} the possibility of constructing a range at the Army Guard’s Salinas Training Area (Camp Santiago), located 35 miles on the south coast area of Puerto Rico. Two days later, Brig Gen. Salvador Roig approved a plan for this project and assigned Captain Gabriel I. Peñagarícano as project officer. The NGB budgeted $10,000 for this construction, this tight budget required a maximum in-house effort. The U.S. Army Antilles Command, caretakers of the Salinas Training Area, provided <b>earth-moving</b> <b>equipment</b> and personnel to level the target area. They also dug necessary holes for electric power poles, communications and strafing and skip-bombing targets. The range towers were donated by the air depot at McDill AFB and transported directly to the range on C-123 aircraft. Nido, who also served as commander of the local chapter of the [...] "Military Order of World Wars", retired from the military with the rank of Brigadier General in 1974.|$|E
