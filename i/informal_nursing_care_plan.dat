An instrument which gives a weighted score for each one of the essential components of the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> was developed. Three judges used this measuring instrument independently of each other, and applied it to the thirty seven <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> received for evaluation. The data showed a high correlation in scores between the three judges. The data also showed that most of the hospitals wrote satisfactory <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> following the participation of their representatives at the workshop. Development of the measurement tool for this study should assist hospital nursing personnel to gain confidence in their ability to judge the value of their plans, assign scores and set up programs for improvement.

The nursing process and standardized nursing terminologies are essential elements to structure nursing documentation in daily nursing information management. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe sustainability and whether and how standardized nursing terminologies, in handwritten versus preprinted versus computerized <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans,</b> changed the content and completeness of documented <b>nursing</b> <b>care.</b> Three audits of patient records were performed: a pretest (n = 291) before a yearlong implementation of standardized nursing terminologies in <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> followed by two posttests: (1) 3 weeks after implementation of nursing terminologies (n = 299) and (2) 22 months after implementation of nursing terminologies and 8 months after implementation of a computerized system (n = 281) in a university hospital. Content and completeness of documented <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> improved after implementation of standardized nursing terminologies. Documentation of <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans,</b> signs and symptoms, related factors, and nursing interventions increased, whereas mean number of nursing diagnoses per patient did not change between audits.

40|$|The {{problem of}} this study was to {{determine}} if the recorded <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> of a selected group of medical and surgical patients provided information upon which to base individualized <b>nursing</b> <b>care.</b> The purposes {{of this study}} were (1) to review the recorded <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> of a selected group of medical and surgical patients to ascertain their content; (2) to determine if there was a relationship between the nursing needs identified and the age, sex, length of hospitalization or the clinical diagnosis of the individual patient; (3) to determine if the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> reviewed provided information upon which to base individualized nursing care; and (4) to use the findings of this study as the basis for recommendations regarding the use of recorded <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> The population consisted of one hundred and thirty-nine medical and surgical patients in a selected general hospital in the Rocky Mountain area. The normative-survey method of research and the documentary frequency technique were used to obtain the data for the study. Although each of the one hundred and thirty-nine <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> reviewed provided information regarding the patient 2 Ì† 7 s age, sex, length of hospitalization and clinical diagnosis, only thirty-two or 23 per cent of the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> contained recorded <b>nursing</b> needs.

The <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> is essentially the documentation of this process.

In this study, a registered nurse assessed the residents to create an individualized <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plan</b> that would be implemented to improve quality of life.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} NANDA - I diagnoses, NOC outcomes, and NIC interventions used in <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> for ICU patient care and determine the factors which influenced the change of the NOC outcome scores. This study was a retrospective and descriptive study using clinical data extracted from the electronic patient records of a large acute care hospital in the Midwest. Frequency analysis, one-way ANOVA analysis, and multinomial logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. A total of 578 ICU patient records between March 25, 2010 and May 31, 2010 were used for the analysis. Eighty - one NANDA - I diagnoses, 79 NOC outcomes, and 90 NIC interventions were identified in the <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans.</b> Acute Pain - Pain Level - Pain Management was the most frequently used NNN linkage.

When the NIC interventions and NOC outcomes used in the actual ICU <b>nursing</b> <b>care</b> <b>plans</b> were compared with core interventions and outcomes for critical <b>care</b> <b>nursing</b> suggested by experts, the core lists could be expanded. Several factors contributing to the change in the five common NOC outcome scores were identified: the number of NANDA - I diagnoses, ICU length of stay, gender, and ICU type.
