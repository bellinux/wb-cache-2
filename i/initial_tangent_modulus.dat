40|$|Load {{rating is}} the process to {{evaluate}} and explore the structural capacity of bridges {{as much as possible}} within safety range. As a balance between economy and safety, proper load ratings save money and keep public safe. Knowing the contribution and interaction of each different soil parameter on the loading can significantly reduce the amount of work when load rating those structures. However, for buried structures without plans, such contribution or interaction is never known. This parametric study explores how much each soil parameter of three types of soils can affect the loading of buried structures without plans. An existing computer software is employed to model the buried structures without plans and to simulate the theoretical structural responses using 2 D finite element analysis approach. The study shows different results for different soil types. In general, as <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> and density increase, moments, thrusts, and shears increase. Plus, as power-law coefficient for <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> and <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> bulk <b>modulus</b> increase, moments, thrusts, and shears always decrease for silty clay whereas they first increase and then decrease for gravelly sand and sandy silt. In conclusion, <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> Young’s <b>modulus,</b> power-law coefficient for <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> Young’s <b>modulus,</b> <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> bulk <b>modulus,</b> and density are the four most sensitive soil parameters with respect to their effects on loading of buried structures...|$|R

The non-linear behavior is attributed {{to the creation of}} cracks in the cement paste of the concrete; the effect of the cracks is taken into account by introducing equivalent voids in the cement paste. The concrete material is modeled as a four-phase composite with three different types of heterogeneities: gravel, sand and voids, embedded in a cement pure paste matrix. The composite homogenization is realized with the Mori–Tanaka method and the overall non-linear response of the concrete is determined by a secant approach. The proposed micromechanical model is able to capture peculiar aspects of the concrete stress–strain curve of uniaxial compression: in most concrete materials, a higher compressive strength is associated with a higher <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> Young’s <b>modulus.</b> Further analogies between the theoretical curves of the proposed method and the experimental curves are shown...|$|R

40|$|The tensile {{behavior}} of plain concrete is customary {{assumed to be}} linear, and the stiffness modulus is approached by {{the value of the}} <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> stiffness <b>modulus</b> in compression.

The stress-strain {{behavior of}} concrete in tension was demonstrated to be highly non-linear, even at very low stress levels. One of the major difficulties in obtaining an accurate tensile stiffness response is to achieve a uniform tensile stress in the section, without creating stress concentrations at any point along the section. These stress disparities will lead to micro crack initiation and falsely recorded responses. A non-linear Finite Element Model (FEM) based on the anisotropic material approach, was developed to produce the load-displacement response of a concrete beam loaded with a two point loading system.

The proposed model is capable of predicting many characteristics of unsaturated interface behavior, such as the dependence of <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus,</b> peak shear stress, dilatancy, and ultimate strength on matric suction, net normal stress, and the interface state measured with respect to the critical state line. To this aim, two distinct yield mechanisms are employed in the model. While change in stress ratio generates plastic deformation in the first mechanism, plastic deformations are due to an increase in net normal stress, decrease in matric suction, or both, in the second mechanism. The presence of appropriate state dependent ingredients enables the model to provide realistic predictions over a wide range of variations of density, net normal stress, and matric suction. By direct comparison of the model predictions with experimental data, the predictive capacity of the proposed model is evaluated...|$|E

When designing and constructing highways or more generally any super structures on dune sands type of soil, {{it is essential to}} make sure that the foundation soil is stable and provides good support to the applied loads. Dune sands soil are known to spread in huge areas throughout the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in which thousands of miles of new roads and highways are being constructed every year. Replacing such kind of weak soil is not an economically feasible alternative since it is very costly; besides, the replacement soil is not always available in nearby sites. This study discusses the possibility of dune sands soil stabilization using Portland cement as the stabilizing agent. Various ratios of cement content mixed with dune sands are used to examine the improvement of engineering properties of dune sands in terms of strength characteristics, and shear strength parameters. The results indicate that mixing dune sands with cement stabilizing agents would influence the engineering properties of treated soil. It is determined that the cement stabilization of dune sands improves the strength characteristics of the treated soil so that it becomes usable as a base material for roads construction and proper foundation material for other types of super structures. It was also determined that a cement content more than 9 % may not probably cause any additional improvement for the stabilized soil.

Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology (Corvis ST) is a recently launched non-contact tonometer, {{which was used}} to measure corneal deformation and its recovery during tonometry in the initial stage of the current study. Two of eight corneal biomechanical parameters (deformation amplitude and time to first applanation) showed favourable repeatability. The usefulness of the Corvis ST is limited because it is restricted to measuring parameters only at the central cornea. A novel corneal indentation device (CID) was developed which was able to precisely measure corneal stiffness, as the force required to indent the cornea to a unit depth. The <b>tangent</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> of the human cornea, or corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> in short, can be calculated from corneal stiffness, thickness, and radius of curvature measured at the central cornea. Using standard mechanical terminology, such as <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> and stiffness, can better describe intrinsic properties of the cornea. Repeatability of the corneal stiffness and corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> measurements, as well as their diurnal variation was evaluated in human subjects before the CID was applied in other clinical studies. Corneal stiffness had an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0. 75 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 7. 32 %, whereas corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> had an ICC of 0. 84 and a CV of 7. 34 %. Neither parameter exhibited significant diurnal variation. The prevalence of myopia is high in Asian countries. It is not known whether axial elongation affects corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> in myopic eyes. The CID was used in two age- and central corneal thickness-matched low (n = 32) and high (n = 32) myopic subjects. Corneal stiffness (approximately 0. 063 Nmm{ 205 }{ 193 }) and corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> (approximately 0. 48 MPa) were determined to be similar in the two groups. However, the intraocular pressure (IOP) was significantly higher in the high myopia group. Any difference in corneal tangent moduli could be masked by the difference in IOP between the two groups. In view of a linear dependency on IOP, the corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> in individual eyes was normalized to 15. 5 mmHg, the mean IOP for normal eyes. The corneas of high myopes revealed a significantly lower <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> (0. 47 ± 0. 087 MPa) than that of low myopes (0. 57 ± 0. 099 MPa). The corneas of the high myopes could be considered as less stiff. Due to the inherent continuity between cornea and sclera, corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> measurement may be useful as an index of the scleral coat of the eye. Orthokeratology {{has become one of the}} effective myopia intervention. A pilot study was conducted to monitor changes in corneal stiffness and <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> in subjects receiving orthokeratology treatment for one month. Eighteen young myopes were recruited. Corneal stiffness was determined to be stable throughout the treatment period, and was approximately 0. 063 to 0. 065 Nmm⁻¹. The mean corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> measurement increased from a baseline of 0. 47 MPa to 0. 52 MPa at one month, returning to 0. 48 MPa after cessation of lens wear for three months. The predictive role of pre-treatment corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> on orthokeratology response deserves further research. Regional mechanical alteration might be expected in diseased or postoperative corneas, but clinical devices cannot measure corneal biomechanics away from the central cornea. The feasibility of the CID to measure corneal stiffness at the peripheral cornea was examined in 25 young adults. Peripheral corneal measurements were performed twice at 3 mm from the temporal limbus, once with subjects looking straight ahead and then with subjects looking nasally. The mean central corneal stiffness was 0. 070 Nmm⁻¹, while that of temporal corneal stiffness was 0. 074 Nmm⁻¹ when the subjects were looking straight ahead, and 0. 080 Nmm- 1 when the subjects were looking nasally. The increased temporal corneal stiffness at nasal gaze may be attributable to corneal thickening and pulling of extraocular muscles. More work is needed to deduce the corneal <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> at the peripheral cornea. School of OptometryPh.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a series of}} cyclic uniaxial compressive loading tests carried out on cylindrical samples of bamboo, {{in order to develop}} unloading and reloading stress-strain models. Two bamboo species from Congo Basin, the Bambusa vulgaris and Oxytenantera abyssinica were used for these experiments. It is found from the test results that the unloading and reloading do not essentially change the shape of the envelope curves of the stress-strain relations and that to predict models for an unloading and a reloading path, the plastic strain, the unloading strain, the strain at yield, the unloading stress, the <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> and the tangent modulus at zero stress (after specimen is completely unloaded) are the controlling parameters. These controlling parameters were analyzed based on the data obtained from test results to propose empirical relations for the unloading and reloading curves. Two empirical relations, one an exponential type relation and the other a power type relation are proposed to idealize the unloading path while the reloading curve is idealized as a combination of a parabolic curve and a straight line. The proposed unloading and reloading stress-strain models were compared to the tests results and the comparison showed that the predicted unloading and reloading stress-strain relations provide a good agreement with the test data. The empirical relations proposed are adapted from those for plain concrete under similar loadin...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Washington State UniversityCarbon {{nanotubes}} {{grown on}} a substrate form a turf - a complex structure of intertwined, mostly nominally vertical tubes, cross-linked by adhesive contact and few bracing tubes. The turfs are compliant and good thermal and electrical conductors. The {{objective of this}} work is to understand the deformation of turfs using computational models. We consider two approaches a) A phenomenological constitutive model of the turf developed from the micromechanical analysis of the turf deformation. We benchmark the developed model using a finite element implementation and compare using the results from nanoindentation tests on CNT turfs. The model includes: nonlinear elastic deformation, small Kelvin-Voigt type relaxation, caused by the thermally activated sliding of contacts, and adhesive contact between the turf and the indenter. The pre-existing (locked-in) strain energy of bent nanotubes produces a high <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus,</b> followed by {{an order of magnitude}} decrease in the tangent modulus with increasing deformation. The strong adhesion between the turf and indenter tip is due to the van der Waals interactions. The finite element simulations capture the results from the nanoindentation experiments, including the loading, visco-elastic relaxation, unloading and adhesive pull-off. b) A detailed discrete model of the turf developed by discretizing the CNTs using inextensible elastica elements with their equivalent material properties obtained from molecular dynamic simulations. The model includes a Lennard Jones type force law and a frictional component to model the interaction between segments of neighboring tubes. The equations of motion are integrated using an explicit integration technique and the response of the turf to external loading is studied. Periodic boundary conditions are used to model infinitely large turfs. Under flat punch indentation, the tendency of the carbon nanotubes to coalesce together and undergo coordinated buckling similar to experimental observations is captured. We observe this behavior only when there is friction between the interacting segments and with the indenter surface. There is a strong qualitative agreement in the nominal stress-strain response between the numerical results and experiments. Department of Mechanical Engineering, Washington State Universit...|$|E
40|$|A {{continuous}} mix {{pilot plant}} was constructed at Aerojet Propulsion Division in Sacramento, California {{to develop a}} robust propellant mixing process for the full scale plant {{that was to be}} built at the NASA Advanced Solid Rocket Motor facility Yellow Creek, Mississippi. The plant was used to conduct dozens of subsystem and full system mixing tests for evaluation of equipment, processing methods, and control schemes for later use at the production plant. As a culmination to this work, a series of designed experiments were conducted using an eight run Taguchi analysis with four factors at two levels each to determine the primary effect of processing parameters on propellant ballistic and mechanical properties. The factors examined in these runs included the propellant production rate (454 (1000) and 622 kg/hr (1371 Ib/hr)), the product temperature out of the mixer (49 (120) and 63 deg C (145 deg F)), mixer screw speed (75 and 90 rpm), and the deaerator excess capacity (20 and 80 percent). Measured response variables included the uncured and cured density, Crawford Bomb liquid strand burning rates, and selected mechanical properties. The experiment revealed that several of the response variables displayed significant changes from run-to-run with the product temperature being the single most important factor. After concluding this experiment, a twenty-six hour confirmation run was conducted to verify the conclusions reached in the designed experiment. The extended run produced over 12, 250 kgs (27, 000 lbs) of propellant meeting all of the pre-run targeted properties including density (1. 803 g/cc (0. 065 lb/in(exp 3)) with a 0. 12 percent coefficient of variation (CV) at 25 deg C (77 deg F)), liquid strand burn rate (0. 889 cm/s (0. 350 in/s) with a 0. 69 percent CV at 4210 KPa (610 psig), 15. 6 deg C (60 deg F)), nominal maximum stress (828 KPa (120 psig) with a 2. 84 percent CV, S&E at 25 deg C (77 deg F), 5. 08 cm/min (2 in/min)), strain at nominal maximum (47. 4 percent with a 3. 96 percent CV), and <b>initial</b> <b>tangent</b> <b>modulus</b> (5349 KPa (775 psig) with a 7. 26 percent CV) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} program (called PGROUPN) {{has been developed}} for the non-linear analysis of pile groups subjected to any combination of vertical loads, horizontal loads and moments. The code {{is based on a}} complete boundary element approach and may be regarded as a generic descendant of the program PGROUP (Banerjee & Driscoll, 1976) which has been extended {{in order to make the}} analysis numerically efficient for practical problems and to include the effects of soil nonlinearity by means of a stepwise linear incremental procedure. One of the main advantages of a non-linear analysis system over a linear elastic approach is that it has the desirable effect of demonstrating a reduction of the corner loads in larger groups in both the vertical and horizontal senses. This observation is of basic importance in practice because it offers the prospect of tangible improvements in design procedures and potential saving of materials. The non-linear analysis put forward in this thesis may be applied to large pile groups embedded in cohesive soil, specifically fully saturated clay under undrained conditions. The soil is modelled as an elastic-perfectly plastic material, which is assumed to behave linearly elastic at small strain levels, but fails when the stresses at the pile-soil interface reach certain limiting values. The analysis only requires the definition of three soil parameters whose physical meanings are clear, ie the (<b>initial</b> <b>tangent)</b> Young’s <b>modulus</b> Es, the Poisson’s ratio vs and the undrained shear strength Cu. This represents a significant advantage over more common load-transfer approaches which are based on either empirical parameters or the results of full-scale pile load tests. The validity and accuracy of the proposed PGROUPN solution have been verified by comparison with alternative numerical analysis for single piles and pile groups subjected to axial and lateral loads. Benchmark solutions in the linear and non-linear range are presented, and the critical question of estimation of soil parameters is addressed. Finally, two published case histories are described which demonstrate the applicability of the method to practical problems...|$|R
