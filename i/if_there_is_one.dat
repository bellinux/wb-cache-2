5|$|Since the 20thcentury it {{has been}} {{traditional}} for the newly crowned monarch {{and other members of}} the royal family to sit for official portraits at Buckingham Palace and appear on the balcony, from where in 1953 they watched a flypast by the Royal Air Force. During the appearance, the monarch wears the Imperial State Crown and, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one,</b> the queen consort wears her consort crown. In the evening, a fireworks display is held nearby, usually in Hyde Park. In 1902, EdwardVII's illness led to the postponement of a fourteen-course banquet at Buckingham Palace. In 1953, two state banquets were held in the ballroom there, and classical music was provided by the Royal Horse Guards.|$|E

5|$|Play {{starts with}} a batter {{standing}} at home plate, holding a bat. The batter waits for the pitcher to throw a pitch (the ball) toward home plate, and attempts {{to hit the ball}} with the bat. The catcher catches pitches that the batter does not hit—as a result of either electing not to swing or failing to connect—and returns them to the pitcher. A batter who hits the ball into the field of play must drop the bat and begin running toward first base, at which point the player is referred to as a runner (or, until the play is over, a batter-runner). A batter-runner who reaches first base without being put out (see below) is said to be safe and is now on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond—however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a hit. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a single. If a player makes it to second base safely {{as a direct result of}} a hit, it is a double; third base, a triple. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one),</b> or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a home run: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit—instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an error.|$|E

25|$|A verbal {{complex in}} the {{negative}} always begins with the prefix gu-. In complexes where the pronominal prefix is either third person intransitive or third-to-third transitive, the prefix –yu- is also included, after the negative and after the main verb (<b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one)</b> but before the pronominal prefix.|$|E
25|$|This feed {{precedes the}} delay (<b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one),</b> {{which allows the}} sweep circuit to unblank the CRT and start the forward sweep, so the CRT can show the {{triggering}} event. High-quality analog delays add a modest cost to an oscilloscope, and are omitted in oscilloscopes that are cost-sensitive.|$|E
25|$|For simplicity, {{consider}} only {{numbers with}} three digits or fewer. To add {{a pair of}} numbers (written in Arabic numerals), write the second number under the first one, so that digits line up in columns: the rightmost column will contain the ones-digit of the second number under the ones-digit of the first number. This rightmost column is the ones-column. The column immediately to its left is the tens-column. The tens-column will have the tens-digit of the second number (if it has one) under the tens-digit of the first number (if it has one). The column immediately {{to the left of}} the tens-column is the hundreds-column. The hundreds-column will line up the hundreds-digit of the second number (<b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one)</b> under the hundreds-digit of the first number (<b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one).</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one,</b> but {{you never}} heard of it. Do you fink you would have heard of a boa-'strictor forty-five feet long <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>one</b> in South America?" ...|$|R

25|$|This, {{according}} to Good, {{is as close}} as one can reasonably expect to get to a condition of perfect ignorance, and it appears that Nicod's condition is still false. Maher made Good's argument more precise by using Carnap's theory of induction to formalize the notion that <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> raven, then it is likely that there are many.|$|E
25|$|If the {{multiplicand}} has a hundreds-digit, {{find the}} product of the multiplier and the hundreds-digit of the multiplicand, and to this product add the carry digit <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one.</b> Then write the resulting sum of the hundreds-column under the line, also in the hundreds column. If the sum has two digits then write down the last digit of the sum in the hundreds-column and write the carry digit to its left: on the thousands-column.|$|E
25|$|For Camus, {{the beauty}} people {{encounter}} in life makes it worth living. People may create meaning {{in their own}} lives, {{which may not be}} the objective meaning of life (<b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one),</b> but can still provide something to strive for. However, he insisted that one must always maintain an ironic distance between this invented meaning and the knowledge of the absurd, lest the fictitious meaning take the place of the absurd.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Good friends, why we meet here {{is known}} to all. Little did we dream of such a meeting when we crossed the Tigris. But that is nothing. We come to act, and not to argue.

25|$|The casket (aron) (<b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one)</b> is {{prepared}} by removing any linings or other embellishments. A winding sheet (sovev) is laid into the casket. Outside the Land of Israel, if the deceased wore a prayer shawl (tallit) during their life, one is {{laid in the}} casket for wrapping the body once it is placed therein. One of the corner fringes (tzitzit) {{is removed from the}} shawl to signify that it will no longer be used for prayer and that the person is absolved from having to keep any of the mitzvot (commandments).|$|E
25|$|In the Solar System, {{the inner}} planets are terrestrial, {{and the outer}} ones are gas giants, but discoveries of extrasolar planets suggest that this {{arrangement}} may not be at all common: numerous Jupiter-sized bodies {{have been found in}} close orbit about their primary, disrupting potential HZs. However, present data for extrasolar planets is likely to be skewed towards that type (large planets in close orbits) because they are far easier to identify; thus {{it remains to be seen}} which type of planetary system is the norm, or indeed <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one.</b>|$|E
25|$|If {{at least}} one of the numbers has a {{hundreds}}-digit then if one of the numbers has a missing hundreds-digit then write a 0 digit in its place. Add the two hundreds-digits, and to their sum add the carry digit <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one.</b> Then write the sum of the hundreds-column under the line, also in the hundreds column. If the sum has two digits then write down the last digit of the sum in the hundreds-column and write the carry digit to its left: on the thousands-column.|$|E

25|$|Medraut {{is never}} {{considered}} Arthur's son in Welsh texts, only his nephew, though The Dream of Rhonabwy mentions {{that the king}} had been his foster father. However, Mordred's later characterization as the king's villainous son has a precedent in the figure of Amhar (or Amr), a son of Arthur's known from only two references. The more important of these, found in an appendix to the Historia Britonum, describes his marvellous grave beside the Herefordshire spring {{where he had been}} slain by his own father in some unchronicled tragedy. What connection exists between the stories of Amr and Mordred, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one,</b> has never been satisfactorily explained.|$|E
25|$|For certain {{decisions}} {{during a}} match, the on-field umpire may {{refer to the}} Third Umpire <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one</b> appointed, who has access to television replays. The Third Umpire is most often used {{in the case of}} run-outs, where the action is too fast for the naked eye but can be also used to decide the cases of disputed boundaries and catches, when the umpires cannot decide if the ball has struck the ground before being caught (but not {{to decide whether or not}} the ball in fact struck the bat or gloves of a batsman). Third Umpire referrals for LBW dismissals have also been trialled in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy is Sri Lanka, and in the 2007 English Domestic Pro40 competition, and are currently being trialled in international matches.|$|E
25|$|Then {{comes the}} tens-column. The tens-column might contain two digits: the tens-digit {{of the first}} number and the tens-digit of the second number. If one of the numbers has a missing tens-digit then the tens-digit for this number can be {{considered}} to be a 0. Add the tens-digits of the two numbers. Then, if there is a carry digit, add it to this sum. If the sum was 18 then adding the carry digit to it will yield 19. If the sum of the tens-digits (plus carry digit, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>one)</b> is less than ten then write it in the tens-column under the line. If the sum has two digits then write its last digit in the tens-column under the line, and carry its first digit (which should be a 1) over to the next column: in this case the hundreds-column.|$|E
