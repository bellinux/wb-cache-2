No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E

5|$|Selenium, and {{possibly}} boron, silicon, arsenic and tellurium, plus the organogen elements are sometimes categorized together as other nonmetals, as they fall outside the halogens and noble gases.

5|$|As {{the matches}} were often played {{consecutively}} without a day between fixtures, Australia employed a rotation policy, {{and as a}} result, Hassett captained the team in nine tour matches while Bradman was rested. Under Hassett's watch, Australia won seven matches, <b>five</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> by an innings, while both draws were rain-affected fixtures {{in which more than}} half the playing time was lost. Hassett had two close encounters, both on damp pitches before the First Test.
