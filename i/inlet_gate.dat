One proposed method of achieving {{this is by}} using plug and socket joints, which are injected with adhesive after assembly. A method for controlling this process, irrespective of component tolerances, is proposed here. A test rig representing a plug and socket joint was injected with the adhesive and a method for successfully filling the butt-jointed end of the joint found. The addition of a restriction to the joint's open end gave a method of filling the cavity without creating any air gaps. The use of neoprene O-ring seals for creating the restriction was investigated. The pressure of the adhesive at the joint <b>inlet</b> (<b>gate)</b> was recorded (data logger), and an analysis {{of this has been}} used to determine the point when adhesive injection can be arrested and the joint correctly filled...|$|E

The <b>inlet</b> <b>gates,</b> located on the Potomac side of the basin, allow water to enter the basin during high tide. During this time, the outlet gates, on the Washington Channel side, close to store incoming water and block {{the flow of water}} and sediment into the channel. As the tide begins to ebb, the general outflow of water from the basin forces the <b>inlet</b> <b>gates</b> to close. This same force is applied to the outlet gates, which open into the channel. Silt build up is swept away by the extra force of water running from the Tidal Basin through the channel. The gates are maintained as navigable by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which has recently completed a project to restore the functioning of the gates.|$|R

Compu tational solutions of the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Strokes (RANS) equations together with the energy equation are performed to obtain the steady, three-dimensional velocity and temperature fields using the standard k-ε model of tur bulence. These flow fields are then used to predict the inclusion sepa p ration by numerically solving the inclusion trans port equation. To account for the effects of turbulence on particle paths a discrete random walk model is employed. It was observed that with the employment of flow modifiers, the inclusion separation capacity of tundish increases with out any large variation in the outlet temperatures. It is shown that inclusion properties and velocity are important pa rameters in defining the operating conditions of a six-strand tundish. </p...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Vacuum-Assisted Resin Transfer Molding (VARTM) {{has become}} a widly used and rapidly growing {{manufacturing}} process for wind turbine blades. However, {{in the case of}} complex geometries, resin flow pattern during the VARTM process tends to be unpredictable. In addition, increasing the size and thickness of the blades is expected to result in additional technical difficulties. Therefore, use of flow pattern simulation tools {{has become a}} necessity in order to avoid costly and time-consuming trial-and-error procedures during manufacturing. In this thesis, a 3 -D non-isothermal framework for modeling the VARTM process for a wind turbine blade was developed. The model was utilized in a case study optimizing <b>inlet</b> <b>gate</b> arrangement, resin temperature, and mold temperature to shorten the filling time. Sequential filling scheme was assumed and different <b>inlet</b> <b>gate</b> arrangements and activation times were used in {{the first phase of the}} study. It was observed that, although increasing the number of the inlet gates tends to shorten the filling process, its effectiveness kept decreasing monotonically. The generally observed filling issue was the formation of dry spots in the sandwich region at the bottom of the part. In the sandwich region, the core splits the flow and forms two flow fronts, one on the top and another at the bottom of the sandwich region. The two flow fronts converge right after the core. For some cases, the slow moving flow front beneath the core was not able to reach its way out and converge with the flow front on the top of the core. To overcome the problem, activation of the auxiliary inlet gates located on the top of the core was postponed. In the second phase of the study, different resin temperatures were used. Increasing the temperature up to 325 °K resulted in shorter filling durations while increasing the temperature further produced dry spots beneath the core. From the flow pattern results in non-sandwich areas, it was concluded that resolving the issue of slow moving flow front at the bottom of the core vii makes it possible to decrease the filling time by 17 % through increasing the resin temperature by 20 °C. The effect of different mold temperatures on the filling time was examined in the third phase of the study. Increasing the mold temperature from the initial value (330 °K) did not result in shorter filling times. To investigate the necessity of employing 3 -D non-isothermal model, a 2. 5 -D non-isothermal model and a 3 -D isothermal model were developed and their results were compared to the results of the 3 -D non-isotheral model. The 2. 5 -D non-isothermal model was unable to accurately predict the flow behavior in the sandwich region. In addition, although the same inlet arrangement and activation times were used for all simulations, the predicted filling time using the 2. 5 -D model was 30 % shorter than the filling time using the 3 -D non-isothermal model. On the other hand, the predicted flow pattern for the 3 -D isothermal model was very similar to that for 3 -D non-isothermal model and the difference between the filling times was relatively small. However, since the model does not keep track of the temperature variations and curing during filling, the simulation of cure after the filling would not provide accurate results...|$|E

This paper studies the intake effect of withdrawing the surface warm water by the stoplog <b>gates</b> <b>inlets</b> and verifies the reliability of the mathematical model by comparative analysis. The results show that for a high dam hydropower station, taking the appropriate multi-level intake measure can withdraw the surface warm water in the spawning season and provide a favorable environment for the fish reproduction.

It can provide technical reference for the solutions of similar problems in the future and it also has important engineering significance on the research of water temperature in large deep reservoirs...|$|R

But local bricklayers demanded that they be paid the salary offered by the city rather than the lower rate offered by Montana Power. The company refuse to hire the workers, and built the structure of concrete instead. Concrete and masonry retaining walls {{north and south of}} the powerhouse were also built to help prevent erosion of the riverbank into the forebay and tailrace. The new forebay was [...] long and [...] wide. The forebay was slightly extended downstream to the new powerhouse, and brick arches of the old powerhouse incorporated into the forebay's walls. The new powerhouse contained three vertical Kaplan turbines (supplied by the S. Morgan Smith Company) capable of generating 18 MW of power, which gave Black Eagle the smallest generating capacity of any of Montana Power's five dams in the Great Falls area. The Smith company also made the oil-pressure governors (which regulated each turbine's speed) and draft tubes (which slowed the water down as it left the turbine, allowing the faster-moving water above to keep imparting energy to the turbine's propellers). The scroll-shaped <b>inlets</b> and wicket <b>gates</b> around the turbines were cemented into the powerhouse's basement, and each turbine installed in its own pit. Each turbine connected through the first floor roof to an Allis-Chalmers generator rated at 7,000 kVA. DC generators acted as exciters for the Allis-Chalmers generators. Six 6,600/2,200 volt transformers stepped down the power for usage.|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Because of {{the fairly}} simple {{equations}} for accurate flow measurement and controlling the water level, weir and gate method is more useful than the separate weir, gate and partial flume methods. Since {{the flowing water}} in the channel always contains sediment particles and floating debris, they are deposited at the <b>gate</b> <b>inlets</b> and behind the weirs which reduces {{the size of the}} channel in the structure range and which reduces some problems such as neighboring land flooding due to overflow of water from the channel banks, threatening the structure stability and reducing the measurement accuracy. Using a combination of weir- gate model, in comparison with other conventional devices, will make it possible to get the actual conditions closer two main hypotheses derived from the relations and accurately measure the discharge coefficient. In this model, the deposited materials are easily passed through the gates and the suspended debris are easily passed over the weirs. One of the combined weir- gate structures is semi cylindrical weir- gate structure. Regarding about the form of the combined weir- gate structures, it has some advantages, including simple design, sediments and floating material flow, high flow discharge coefficient compared with other replaceable structures and its being economic. Semi Cylindrical gate turning around center Axis, for reason of rotation the center becomes Conversion to wire, wire gate with opening with different height. Materials and Methods: The experiments were conducted in a rectangular flume with the length of 8 m, width of 0. 282 m and height of 0. 3 m in Soil Conservation and Watershed Management Research Institute. In this research, PVC pipes were used as semi cylindrical gate structures. The experiments were conducted for three diameters 70, 120 and 160 mm with height of the opening between zeros until radius, angles zero, 30, 45, 60 and 90 degree and differently discharging. Experiments were performed at a discharge limit of 2 - 27 l/s. In order to decrease turbulence of the flow, the gate was installed at the end 4 m of the flume. The ratio of cylindrical structure diameter to channel width (D/B) was in the range of 0. 25 to 0. 57 and the Froude number was in the range of 0. 08 to 0. 55. Results and Discussion: Coefficient discharge of semi cylindrical structure and then dimensionless parameters of [H/P], [a/H], [/H] and [Fr] against the discharge coefficient in the studied gate opening between zero until radius were investigated. According to result with decrease dimensionless parameter of a/H, discharge coefficient increased, So that the maximum Coefficient discharge rate of angle 90 degrees and minimum angle 0 degrees. Also in a constant of a/H for the curvature of the downstream and upstream, with increasing the diameter of semi cylinder, discharge coefficient remains and has no change, shows that changes in diameter of semi cylinder have no significant impact on discharge coefficient. With increasing H/P for both curves upstream and the downstream, discharge coefficient increased. Also in a constant of H/P for the curvature of the downstream and upstream, with increasing the diameter of semi cylinder, discharge coefficient remains. With constant of angles with increasing Freud for all angles, both the curvature of the downstream and upstream, /H decreased. Also in a constant of Freud and angles, with increasing the diameter of semi cylinder, /H remains. According to the result, discharge coefficient of semi cylindrical gates varies, in Experimental limit, from 0. 45 to 1. 45 which is more than that of sluice gates reported by the USBR. One of the reasons, this is ascribed to this is the difference between the amount of entrance, head loss in this structure, because when the flow approaches cylindrical gate, due to curvedness of the wall upstream, a gradual gathering of flow lines gives the aerodynamic method to entrance section, thus decreasing resistance against the flow and entrance head loss and increasing discharge coefficient. However, in sluice gates the vertical wall in entrance section is conducive to fast gathering of flow line, thereby increasing resistance against flow, increasing entrance head loss, and decreasing discharge coefficient relative to a semi cylindrical method. Conclusion: The results showed that increasing Froude coefficient and decreasing the a/H (ratio of gate opening to upstream water depth) dimensionless parameter decrease, respectively increase the discharge coefficient and decrease head loss in all aspects of structural alignment. Within addition by increasing the H/P dimensionless parameter (ratio of upstream water depth to structure diameter) discharge coefficient increased. Results showed that the maximum and minimum values of discharge coefficient are related respectively to 90 degree and 0 degree angle...|$|R
