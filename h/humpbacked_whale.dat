25|$|Macero found greater fame as a {{producer}} for Columbia Records. He joined in 1957, and produced hundreds of records while at the label, working with dozens of artists including Mingus, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Thelonious Monk, Johnny Mathis, Count Basie, Dave Brubeck, Tony Bennett, Charlie Byrd, Maynard Ferguson and Stan Getz. He was also responsible for signing Mingus, Monk, and Byrd to Columbia. Additionally, Macero produced over 100 albums of classical orchestral music for Columbia, including less conventional, contemporary pieces such as And God Created Great Whales by Alan Hovhaness, which required him to overlay recordings of <b>humpbacked</b> <b>whale</b> songs on to the orchestral track.|$|E
6000|$|In {{connexion}} {{with this}} appellative of [...] "Whalebone whales," [...] {{it is of}} great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions {{to some kind of}} whales, yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents. How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the <b>humpbacked</b> <b>whale,</b> each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then this same <b>humpbacked</b> <b>whale</b> and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales, they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one of the whale-naturalists has split.|$|E

40|$|Though {{research}} settings vary widely, shared {{concerns and}} overlapping approaches will bring together three separate disciplines in this session. The first {{goal is to}} allow participants to share their own research into animal behavior. Dr. Ingmanson will focus on ape gestural communication, drawing on her work with great apes and gibbons. Dr. Jahoda will present information from his research into the behavior and ecology of <b>humpbacked</b> <b>whales,</b> which has been ongoing since the mid- 1970 s. Dr. Shyne will share some of her work on zoo animal welfare, and how behavioral training techniques can improve the care and life for these animals. The second goal of this session will be to share insights into the challenges and successes we have had incorporating students into our research. These differ with discipline, but our shared interests in animal behavior and welfare allow us to bridge {{the boundaries of the}} wet, wild and in-betweens...|$|R
