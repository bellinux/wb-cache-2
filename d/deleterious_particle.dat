40|$|Radio-frequency (RF) heating {{is fully}} {{dependent}} on edge plasma conditions and {{particularly on the}} acceleration of charged particles which can damage the antennas and surroundings. Rectified RF field induces drifts on ions that can hit the first wall, causing hot spots, sputtering, impurities, fuel dilution and, eventually, disruption. These phenomena mainly depend on the antenna geometry and materials, on the plasma density profile at the edge and on the connection patterns. The heat flux attributed to accelerated ions is somehow proportional to the RF potential {{in front of the}} antenna. Because of this, the understanding of the RF potential generation in front of the antenna is crucial for every high RF power systems, in order to predict the <b>deleterious</b> <b>particle</b> flux and therefore mitigate its effect by means of a proper design. The TOPICA code, an innovative tool realized for the analysis and design of ICRH and LH antennas, has been upgraded to evaluate the RF potential in front of the antenna. The solution of the Maxwell's equations in plasma combined with the RF field map at the plasma edge (standard outputs of TOPICA calculation) allow for the computation of the RF fields also in the plasma region. A new TOPICA module has been developed to account for a rigorous procedure to obtain the RF potentials and RF potential mitigation techniques through antenna geometrical modifications have been studied and will be presente...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a new simple method for {{avoiding}} particle-induced macroscopic defects using the liquid phase epitaxy (LPE) of GaN as an example. In a series of growth experiments by LPE of GaN it is demonstrated {{that the number of}} particle-induced macrodefects in the epitaxial layers correlates strongly and reproducibly with the density of the solution. In solutions with a density higher than that of the <b>deleterious</b> <b>particles,</b> the particles float on the solution and hence are hindered to get into contact with the seed, which is placed {{at the bottom of the}} crucible. Consequently, so-called depressions - a typical particle-induced defect in GaN-LPE layers - are avoided. The principle of avoiding the formation of macroscopic defects originating from particles by adapting the density of the solution (density criterion) should be generally applicable to solution growth processes, regardless of the material system...|$|R
40|$|Diatoms produce diverse {{three-dimensional}} regular silica structures with nanometer to micrometer {{dimensions and}} hold considerable promise for biological and biomimetic fabrication of nanostructured materials and devices. In the present work, {{we describe the}} ultrastructural characterization of porous structures in diatom biosilica and discuss their potential as membrane filters for diffusion based separations. The frustules of two centric diatom species, Coscinodiscus sp. and Thalassiosira eccentrica, were investigated using scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. Their morphological features, including pore size, shape, porosity, and pore organization, are described. We observed that although pore organization in frustules of Thalassiosira eccentrica and Coscinodiscus sp. is in reverse order, a striking commonality is the size range of the smallest pores in both species (around 40 nm). The consensus lower pore size suggests that frustule valves have a common function at this size of excluding viruses or other <b>deleterious</b> <b>particles,</b> and the pore size and organization is optimized for this purpose. We suggest and implement an experimental approach to study the potential of diatom frustules for diffusive separation of molecular or nanoparticular components in microfluidic or lab-on-a-chip environments...|$|R
50|$|In {{the recent}} past the problem of {{removing}} the <b>deleterious</b> iron <b>particles</b> from a process stream had a few alternatives. Magnetic separation was typically limited and moderately effective. Magnetic separators that used permanent magnets could generate fields of low intensity only. These worked well in removing ferrous tramp but not fine paramagnetic particles. Thus high-intensity magnetic separators that were effective in collecting paramagnetic particles came into existence. These focus on the separation of very fine particles that are paramagnetic.|$|R
5000|$|Low beam impedance. The low {{electrical}} loss in an SRF cavity allows their geometry to {{have large}} beampipe apertures while still maintaining a high accelerating field along the beam axis. Normal-conducting cavities need small beam apertures to concentrate the electric field as compensation for power losses in wall currents. However, the small apertures can be <b>deleterious</b> to a <b>particle</b> beam {{due to their}} spawning of larger wakefields, which are quantified by the accelerator parameters termed [...] "beam impedance" [...] and [...] "loss parameter".|$|R
40|$|Numbers {{of diesel}} engines in both {{stationary}} and mobile applications are increasing nowadays. Diesel engines emit lower Hydrocarbon (HC) and Carbon monoxide (CO) than gasoline engines. However, they can produce more nitrogen oxides (NOx) and have higher particulate matter (PM). On the other hand, emissions standards are getting stringent {{day by day}} due to considerable concerns about unregulated pollutants and particularly ultrafine <b>particles</b> <b>deleterious</b> effect on human health. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) treatment of exhaust gas {{is known as a}} promising technology for both NOx and PM reduction by introducing plasma inside the exhaust gas. Vehicle exhaust gases undergo chemical changes when exposed to plasma. In this study, the PM removal mechanism using NTP by applying high voltage pulses of up to 20 kVpp with a repetition rate of 10 kHz are investigated. It is found that, voltage increase not necessarily has a positive effect on PM removal in diesel engine emissions...|$|R
40|$|Inadvertent {{failure of}} gas {{insulated}} system {{such as high}} voltage GIS is traced to a freak mechanism, in particle induced breakdown. While conducting (metallic) particles cause a direct breakdown of the gaseous insulation due to {{a high degree of}} non-uniformity of electric fields surrounding them, dielectric (insulation) particles give rise to disruptive discharges due to surface charges acquired by them in the strongly divergent electric field in their vicinity. The <b>deleterious</b> effects of <b>particles</b> are too well known to be enumerated. Since it is not always possible to fabricate GIS without parasitic floating and fixed particles, and scavenging the particles bordering on microscopic dimensions is very difficult, study of the particle aided breakdown study acquires particular significance in GIS. The effect of particles of either kind being the same; the reduction in the dielectric strength of the system, every effort should be made to either prevent outages due to them or workout means of stabilising the system in their presence. The present paper, attempts to make a small contribution in this direction...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} in the literature that contamination within oxygen systems can create significant fire hazards. Cleanliness limits for nonvolatile residues, ranging from 10 to 500 mg/sq m, have been established for various industries and types of oxygen systems {{to reduce the risk of}} ignition of flammable organic films. Particulate cleanliness limits used for oxygen systems vary considerably. Maximum allowed particle size, quantity limits, and allocations for fibers or metallic particles are all variables seen in aerospace cleanliness limits. Particles are known to have the potential to ignite within oxygen systems and must be limited to prevent fires. Particulate contamination may also pose risks to the performance of oxygen systems that are unrelated to ignition hazards. An extensive literature search was performed to better understand the relative importance of particle ignition mechanisms versus other <b>deleterious</b> effects of <b>particles</b> on oxygen systems and to identify rationale for derivation of particulate cleanliness limits for specific systems. The identified risks of different types and sizes of particles and fibers were analyzed. This paper summarizes the risks identified and rationale that may be used to derive particulate cleanliness limits for specific oxygen systems...|$|R
