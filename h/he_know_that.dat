25|$|Nutt {{knew that}} Thumb {{was in love}} with Lavinia. He was jealous. He had a fight with Thumb in a {{dressing}} room at the Museum. He threw him on the floor, and beat him up. Nutt invited himself along when Lavinia was asked to Barnum's home for a weekend visit. Little did <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> Thumb and his mother would be there, too.|$|E
500|$|Tommy Smith, booked {{during the}} game for his tackle on Clarke, had been called to the hearing to give evidence. He {{condemned}} the whole affair as a farce. Smith confirmed that the initial foul on Keegan was committed by Johnny Giles, not Bremner, but Bremner was the first Leeds player Keegan saw {{when he turned to}} retaliate. Smith says that as soon as he came into the hearing, an unnamed FA official immediately accused him of starting all the trouble with his [...] "very first tackle of the game". Smith retorted that the man was not even at the game and so how could <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> The FA official replied by saying: [...] "This is a democratic hearing of the evidence, you're not allowed to ask questions". Smith says he laughed out loud at the absurdity of that statement. At this point Matt Busby, who was on the FA committee, intervened and said: [...] "I saw what happened. That'll be all, Tommy, thanks for coming". Smith says he left the room [...] "wondering how it was possible that a person such as that committee member could have {{a key role in the}} running of football in this country".|$|E

As the flight had taken off late, they had not picked up the radio message broadcast by Prestwick airfield informing them of this. Parmentier was thus unaware of the deterioration in the weather: were he aware of it {{he would have been}} able to divert to Shannon. The routine weather reports broadcast from Prestwick had given a cloud cover of [...] No new forecasts, which would have told Parmentier of the expected decreased cloud cover were broadcast. Nor did <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> already that evening two airliners from SAS had turned back rather than attempt a landing at Prestwick.|$|E

2500|$|More {{details were}} {{released}} in the days preceding the finale. Michael Weatherly disclosed, [...] "The way this season is ending, and what's gonna happen with Ziva and Tony and Rivkin, it's pretty massive and explosive, and it's gonna span four episodes." [...] De Pablo added, [...] "We could not be farther away from kissing. I'm telling you, it's not 'I hate you' [...] anger; it's 'I want to kill you' anger. Like, 'I want to shoot you in the head, but instead I'm gonna put my gun on your knee' angerâ€¦.He does something to her that is almost unforgivable. However, the reason he does it is because he truly believes it's going to help her. Little does <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> he almost kills her." [...] When asked how the storyline would affect Tony and Ziva's interactions, Tadros replied, [...] "I think that love can hurt and heal. In this case, we'll have opportunity to see both of those things take place. I don't want to say too much, but... I think it will only make their connection stronger, as they learn {{a lot more about}} each other." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, how did <b>he</b> <b>know</b> <b>that?</b> {{he asked}} himself as he went down the stairs.|$|E

60|$|You see it {{was this}} way: Reddy's wits were working very fast there in Farmer Brown's henhouse. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had only a forlorn chance of {{escaping}} when Farmer Brown's boy should come to open the henhouse in the morning. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must {{make the most of}} <b>that</b> forlorn chance. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> freedom is a thousand times better than a full stomach.|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} parties in Peterborough minster: a smaller faction of stout-hearted English, a larger one who favored William and the French customs, with Prior Herluin at their head. Herluin wanted not for foresight, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> evil was coming on him. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the Danes {{were in the}} fen. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> Hereward was with them. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{they had come to}} Crowland. Hereward could never mean to let them sack it. Peterborough must be their point. And Herluin set his teeth, like a bold man {{determined}} to abide the worst, and barred and barricaded every gate and door.|$|R
60|$|And in {{that long}} kiss {{darkness}} came upon him again, and when again he was conscious <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was alone and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was to die. He was wearily {{glad that he}} was to die.|$|R

50|$|In {{decision}} theory, the sure-thing principle {{states that}} a decision maker {{who would take}} a certain action if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> event E obtained, and also if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> the negation of E obtained, should also take that same action if <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> nothing about E.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>knew</b> {{his power}} over her. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{she would not}} insist upon his leaving her. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that,</b> her fears for him being aroused, she would be uneasy if he were out of her sight.

60|$|But Mr. Slope {{could not}} help himself. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was wrong in devoting his time to the back drawing-room in Dr. Stanhope's house. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> what took place there would, if divulged, utterly ruin him with Mrs. Bold. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> scandal would soon come upon his heels and spread abroad among the black coats of Barchester some tidings, exaggerated tidings, of the sighs which he poured into the lady's ears. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was acting against the {{recognized}} principles of his life, against those laws of conduct by which he hoped to achieve much higher success.

60|$|Brooks {{laid the}} two letters {{down with a}} curious mixture of sensations. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{a very short time}} ago he might have {{considered}} himself brokenhearted, and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> {{as a matter of fact}} he was nothing of the sort.
