40|$|This paper {{considers}} the passive control of lateral critical speeds in high-speed rotating shafts through application of eccentric balancing sleeves. Equations of motion for a rotating flexible shaft with eccentric sleeves at the free ends are derived using the extended Hamilton Principle, considering inertial, non-constant rotating speed, Coriolis and centrifugal effects. A {{detailed analysis of}} the passive control characteristics of the <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeve</b> mechanism {{and its impact on the}} shaft dynamics, is presented. Results of the analysis are compared with those from three-dimensional finite element simulations for 3 practical case studies. Through a comparison and evaluation of the relative differences in critical speeds from both approaches it is shown that consideration of <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeve</b> flexibility becomes progressively more important with increasing sleeve length. The study shows that the critical speed of high-speed rotating shafts can be effectively controlled through implementation of variable mass/stiffness <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeve</b> systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{imbalance}} {{caused by}} <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeve</b> radial compliance mechanism rotor {{system is a}} main issue in scroll compressor. In this study, the mechanical model of the structure with the <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeve</b> behind the orbiting scroll is established, the offset level of the main and second balance weight inertia force action line and inertia force action line of the eccentric weight, {{as well as the}} effect of this deviation on the second balance and the main and second bearing loads were investigated in terms of working principle, structure and loading. The results show that the structure has great influence on scroll compressor rotor system balance in reducing orbiting radius regulation. It is suggested that the correlated parameters should be optimized in designing radial compliance mechanism structure...|$|E
40|$|Means for {{controlling}} the compression pressure in an {{internal combustion engine}} having one or more cylinders and subject to widely varying power output requirements are provided. Received between each crank pin and connecting rod is an <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeve</b> selectively capable of rotation about the crank pin and/or inside the rod and for latching with the rod to vary the effective length of the connecting rod and thereby the clearance volume of the engine. The eccentric normally rotates inside the connecting rod during the exhaust and intake strokes but a latching pawl carried by the eccentric is movable radially outwardly to latch the rod and eccentric together during the compression and power strokes. A control valve responds to intake manifold pressure to time the supply of hydraulic fluid to move the latch-pawl outwardly, varying the effective rod length to maintain a substantially optimum firing chamber pressure at all intake manifold pressures...|$|E
40|$|A primary {{problem in}} the turbine {{industry}} {{is associated with the}} mitigation of bending vibration modes of high-speed rotating shafts. This is especially pertinent at speeds approaching the critical frequencies. Here, a shaft, complete with <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeves</b> at the free ends, is designed and developed, with a view to passively control critical speeds and vibration induced bending. In this article, using the Extended Hamiltonâ��s principle, the equations of motion (axial, torsional, inplane and out-of-plane bending) for a rotating flexible shaft are derived; considering non-constant rotating speed, Coriolis and centrifugal forces, with the associated boundary conditions due to the <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeves</b> and torsional springs in angular deformations of lateral vibrations in bending. The numerical dynamic analysis showed that considering the sleeves as flexible only had a small effect upon the first critical speed of the shaft. Therefore, rigid body modelling of the sleeves is sufficient to capture the essential dynamics of the system. The derived equations of motion with the associated boundary conditions show {{that in the case of}} constant rotating speed, the <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeves</b> are coupling xy-bending with xz-bending and also torsion. Also the derived equations of motion and the associated boundary conditions in the case of non-constant rotating speed are essentially nonlinear due to inertia terms. This work is essential to the advance of linear and nonlinear dynamic analysis of the system by means of determination of normal modes and critical speeds of the shaft.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Based on the {{analysis}} of the common NN-type involute planetary gear reducer with small tooth number difference, this paper replaced the traditional <b>eccentric</b> axle <b>sleeve</b> with double <b>eccentric</b> crankshaft, so as to simplify the structure of involute planetary gear reducer with small tooth number difference; and then used closed graph to select the modification coefficients of the internal gear pairs thereby accomplishing the design of the new type reducer; Finally, used ANSYS Workbench software to analyze the modal of 3 D virtual prototype, and arrived at a realized conclusion:the inherent frequency of the system is much higher than the input frequency, so resonance will not occur. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn orbital head of orbital {{forging press}} with double <b>eccentric</b> <b>sleeve</b> has {{four types of}} movement, but most {{workpieces}} are formed by circular movement. The motion equation is established according to the structure and the movement principle of orbital head. Then find that the rotational speed of inner and outer eccentric sleeves simply affects the rotation period of orbital head in circle and straight line movements, and not only affects the rotation period but also the movement shape in spiral and rose curve movements. The eccentricity of inner and outer eccentric sleeves can change the shape {{and size of the}} movement, adjust the distance from the movement to the center point, and change straight line movement into ellipse, spiral and rose curve movements do not cross through the center. It can solve the problem that straight line, spiral and rose curve movements pass the center, orbital angle is zero and the forming force increases sharply, achieve the continuous local deformation of workpiece during the forming process...|$|E
