40|$|Efficient use of {{call center}} {{operators}} through technological innovations more often {{come at the}} expense of added operation management issues. In this paper, the stationary characteristics of an $M/G/ 1 $ retrial queue is investigated where the single server, subject to active failures, primarily attends incoming calls and <b>directs</b> <b>outgoing</b> calls only when idle. The incoming calls arriving at the server follow a Poisson arrival process, while outgoing calls are made in an exponentially distributed time. On finding the server unavailable (either busy or temporarily broken down), incoming calls intrinsically join the virtual orbit from which they re-attempt for service at exponentially distributed time intervals. The system stability condition along with probability generating functions for the joint queue length distribution of the number of calls in the orbit and the state of the server are derived and evaluated numerically in the context of mean system size, server availability, failure frequency and orbit waiting time.

40|$|When westerners {{attempt to}} develop friendships with Japanese they often rely on an {{outgoing}} style that exudes friendliness. Such <b>direct,</b> <b>outgoing</b> friendliness from foreigners {{may be viewed}} with suspicion by the Japanese. In all actions, Japanese prefer kindness over friendliness. Friendships form through kindness, {{and it is important}} that foreigners understand that they cannot speed-up the friendship process through friendly communication. Data from a focus group show how Japanese label and respond to communication styles which violate expectations of appropriate communication and inhibit the friendship formation process. Friendliness Does Not Make Friends in Japan As we move into the 21 st century, increased mobility, increased economic interdependence, and ever-expanding communication technologies create cross cultural interaction in ways we are just beginning to understand and appreciate. Global travel is at an all-time high. And global travelers, even if they are visitors only for a short time in host countries, will have to adapt to the communication expectations of those host countries. U. S. travelers in Japan are often quick to observe the uniqueness of the Japanese way. Most realize that patience is needed when doing business in Japan. This need for patience is driven by cultural differences in style, not only for business decisions, but also for building friendships. As {{in other parts of the}} world, building friendships takes time. The U. S. traveler cannot speed-up the process of making friends in Japan with an outgoing, effervescent speaking style. This paper considers the problem of American outgoing communication styles in Japan. After sharing some personal background information, it articulates how kindness and friendliness are valued in Japan and how the friendly American may actually retard the friendship building process. Then the pathways to Japanese friendships are explored. Next, the paper shows how Japanese handle violations t...|$|R

40|$|The current fiber-based {{illumination}} {{systems of}} laparoscopes {{are unable to}} uniformly illuminate a large enough area in abdomen due to the limited numerical aperture (NA) of the fiber bundle. Most energy is concentrated in a small region {{at the center of}} the illumination area. This limitation becomes problematic in laparoscopes which require capturing a wide field of view. In this paper, we propose an aspherical lens array which is used to <b>direct</b> the <b>outgoing</b> rays from the fiber bundle of laparoscope to produce a more uniformly illuminated, substantially larger field coverage than standalone fiber source. An intensity feedback method is developed to design the aspherical lens unit for extended non-Lambertian sources, which is the key to the design of this lens array. By this method, the lens unit is obtained after only one iteration, and the lens array is constructed by Boolean operation. Then, the ray-tracing technique is used to verify the design. Further, the lens array is fabricated and experimental tests are performed. The results clearly show that the well-illuminated area is increased to about 0. 107 m 2 from 0. 02 m 2 (about 5 x larger than a standard fiber illumination source). More details of the internal organs can be clearly observed under this improved illumination condition, which also reflects the significant improvement in the optical performance of the laparoscope...|$|R

In addition to standard answering machine functions, the VMC features programmable <b>outgoing</b> message <b>selection,</b> message routing, response to caller's touch tone signals, and remote programming ability. The VMC will answer incoming telephone calls, deliver outgoing messages which are Programmably selectable from as many as 16 digitized audio messages stored on the PC's hard disk, record incoming messages to the hard disk or optionally to an external tape recorder, route messages to a specified receiver, respond to a caller's touch tone signals, and enter a remote programming mode {{as a result of}} a special code sent by the caller. Audio messages are processed digitally via A/D and D/A converters which receive and send 8 -bit data to and from the IBM PC through a selectable port address. The A/D conversion is implemented with the ADC 0802 which is operated at a clock rate of 512 kHz. The D/A conversion is implemented with the DAC 0830. Interface with the telephone line is accomplished with the speech circuit TP 5700 coupled through opto-couplers. Messages are recorded using an external 600 -ohm dynamic microphone and played back through an external 8 -ohm speaker.

50|$|Traditional {{transport}} networks {{are made of}} optical fiber-based links between telecommunications offices, where multiple wavelengths are multiplexed to increase {{the capacity of the}} fiber. The wavelengths are terminated on electronic devices called transponders, undergoing an optical-to-electrical conversion for signal Reamplification, Reshaping, and Retiming (3R). Inside a telecommunications office, the signals are then handled to and switched by a transport switch (aka optical cross-connect or optical switch) and either are dropped at that office, or <b>directed</b> to an <b>outgoing</b> fiber link where they are again carried as wavelengths multiplexed into that fiber link towards the next telecommunications office. The act of going through Optical-Electrical-Optical (O-E-O) conversion through a telecommunications office causes the network to be considered opaque. When the incoming wavelengths do not undergo an optical-to-electrical conversion and are switched through a telecommunications office in the optical domain using all-optical switches (also called photonic cross-connect, optical add-drop multiplexer, or Reconfigurable Optical Add-Drop Multiplexer (ROADM) systems), the network is considered to be transparent. Hybrid schemes that leverage optical bypasses and provide limited O-E-O conversions at key locations across the network, are referred to as translucent networks.|$|R
40|$|Man’s {{attempt to}} control the amount of {{available}} water has taken two approaches, i. e., weather modification and water storage {{through the use of}} man-made reservoirs. In either case, it is necessary to ascertain the water vapor content of the atmosphere. In the case of weather modification, if the water vapor content is insufficient, it is futile to attempt to start precipitation. In the case of reservoirs, {{it is important to know}} the evaporation rate since it has been demonstrated that some reservoirs provide a net negative contribution to the total water supply by increasing the normal evaporation losses. Any {{attempt to control}} evaporation losses requires a measuring system to determine the effectiveness of the method. Presently available methods of measuring atmospheric water vapor content are severely limited in that they provide data only at the point of measurement whereas the value desired is an integrated figure over a long path (1 / 2 to 2 miles or more). Regarding the ineffectiveness of present methods, Malone et al. (1951) comment on the uncertainties of relating evaporation pan measurements to actual surface evaporation losses and say “A technique for determining evaporation, either by <b>direct</b> measurement of <b>outgoing</b> moisture or by computation from the energy balance, turbulent transfer, or other theory is urgently needed. ” Although the above reference was published in 1951, the need for measurement mentioned is still unfilled. Donnan et al. (1964) say: “Point observations in space and time of variables affecting evaporation and consumptive use have limited value because of the difficulty making these observations representative of the area and time duration being studies. Increased effort should be directed toward observations which are integrated measurements. ”The system described herein is intended to fill the need outlined above. It will provide a measure of the integrated water vapor content over any chosen path provided only that each end of the path is accessible for equipment installation. The area required for installation at either end is not excessive since the base dimensions of the receiver are 13 x 17 inches and those of the light source are 1 x 3 feet...|$|R
