5|$|Construction of {{the reactor}} itself {{commenced}} in February 1944. Watched by Compton, Matthias, DuPont's Crawford Greenewalt, Leona Woods and Fermi, who inserted the first slug, the reactor was powered up beginning on 13 September 1944. Over {{the next few}} days, 838 tubes were loaded and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared well but around 03:00 the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor started up again, only to shut <b>down</b> <b>once</b> more.|$|E
5|$|Following Miami's post-touchdown kickoff, Virginia Tech {{began its}} first {{offensive}} {{possession of the}} game at its 24-yard line. A three-yard rush from fullback Scott Dovel was followed by two rushes from Tech's Cyrus Lawrence: one for eight yards and a second for 17 more. These drove Tech into Miami territory and gave the Hokies a first <b>down.</b> <b>Once</b> there, however, Miami's defense stiffened and Tech was forced to punt. Miami recovered the ball at its 12-yard line, and the Hurricanes began their second possession of the game. Fullback Chris Hobbs and running back Smokey Roan alternated carries, picking up yardage and first downs before entering Virginia Tech territory. On the Hurricanes' first play on Tech's side of the field, however, Miami committed two penalties, pushing the Hurricanes back 20 yards. Following the penalties, Miami was unable {{to pick up a}} first down and punted back to the Hokies.|$|E

50|$|Quirke {{was dropped}} from the {{starting}} fifteen in 1939, however, he won a third Railway Cup medal as a non-playing substitute following a 4-4 to 1-6 defeat of Leinster. He was reinstated to the starting fifteen the following year and won a fourth winners' medal as Leinster were <b>downed</b> <b>once</b> again.|$|R
5|$|Indiana's defense {{also held}} fast {{on the next}} possession, and Tech was unable to gain a first down {{following}} the turnover. Tech's punt was returned to the Indiana 38-yard line, where the Hoosier offense returned to the field. At first, the Hoosiers were successful moving the ball as they picked up a first down in Tech territory via a pass from Paci. The success was short-lived, however, as the Hoosiers were unable to gain a first <b>down</b> <b>once</b> on the Tech {{side of the field}} and had to punt. Sanders returned the kick to the Tech 21-yard line, where Tech began its third possession of the second half. Tech picked up a first down via two DeShazo passes, but couldn't gain another. Tech's punt was downed at the Indiana 20-yard line, and Indiana's offense began work with 3:02 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to the missed field goal, Alabama {{began its}} drive at its 25-yard line—the line of {{scrimmage}} for the field goal. In the drive's first play, Zow completed a seven-yard pass to wide receiver Calvin Hall. Alexander then ran {{to the left side}} for a two-yard gain. On third down, Alexander gained three yards and a first down. After that, Moore sacked Zow for a two-yard loss, to the 35-yard line. After the sack, Zow was hit again by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The fumble was scooped up by an Alabama player, however, and resulted in a gain of four yards. Zow then completed a pass to Alexander at the 50-yard line for a first <b>down.</b> <b>Once</b> there, Alabama was twice penalized five yards for false starts on consecutive plays. The penalties ran out the final seconds of the first quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 70.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break <b>down</b> <b>once</b> they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E

5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed {{his hand over his}} heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to the}} bathroom during the flight, and soon there was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow <b>down.</b> <b>Once</b> a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the virtual}} {{intelligence}} {{is kept in}} lockdown in another research station, Archers tells Shepard that he/she needs to manually override security from two other facilities {{to gain access to}} it and shut it <b>down.</b> <b>Once</b> the station where the virtual intelligence is contained has been unlocked, Shepards proceeds to the main server room. Shepard eventually accesses a terminal to cut all access to the outside world, but in the process the virus infects Shepard's cybernetic implants. Shepard awakens in a virtual reality, and heads to the central core room, where he finds that Archer had experimented on David in an attempt to control the geth. Shepard manages to defeat the virtual intelligence as it attempts to establish an upload link to the Normandy. Afterwards, David is shown in the core tied up to tubes in his arms and mouth, begging for help. Archer comes and argues for Shepard to keep the experiment going. Shepard is then given the option to either take David to a specialized academy or leave him at the station with his brother.|$|E
5|$|Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side-scrolling {{platform}} video game: {{the majority}} of the game features the player-controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two-dimensional plane. The player character can move left and right and can jump; unlike the prior trilogy of episodes in the series, known collectively as Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, Keen cannot jump higher using a pogo stick. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or <b>down.</b> <b>Once</b> entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though unlike in Vorticons the player can save their game at any point. In between levels the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed.|$|E

5|$|In September 1944, Fermi {{inserted}} the first uranium fuel slug into the B Reactor at the Hanford Site, the production reactor designed to breed plutonium in large quantities. Like X-10, {{it had been}} designed by Fermi's team at the Metallurgical Laboratory, and built by DuPont, but it was much larger, and was water-cooled. Over the next few days, 838 tubes were loaded, and the reactor went critical. Shortly after midnight on 27 September, the operators began to withdraw the control rods to initiate production. At first all appeared to be well, but around 03:00, the power level started to drop and by 06:30 the reactor had shut down completely. The Army and DuPont turned to Fermi's team for answers. The cooling water was investigated {{to see if there}} was a leak or contamination. The next day the reactor suddenly started up again, only to shut <b>down</b> <b>once</b> more a few hours later. The problem was traced to neutron poisoning from xenon-135, a fission product with a half-life of 9.2 hours. Fortunately, DuPont had deviated from the Metallurgical Laboratory's original design in which the reactor had 1,500 tubes arranged in a circle, and had added 504 tubes to fill in the corners. The scientists had originally considered this over-engineering a waste of time and money, but Fermi realized that by loading all 2,004 tubes, the reactor could reach the required power level and efficiently produce plutonium.|$|E
5|$|Indiana {{received}} the Virginia Tech kickoff {{in the end}} zone for a touchback and began the first drive of the game at their 20-yard line. On the first play of the game, Indiana rushed up the middle for a six-yard gain. After Paci threw an incomplete pass, he attempted to scramble for the first down but was tackled one yard short. Indiana punted the ball, and after a block-in-the-back penalty against Virginia Tech, the Hokies began their first possession at their 15-yard line. After a five-yard false start penalty on Tech's first play, Hokie running back Dwayne Thomas rushed the ball for a 10-yard gain, making up twice the yardage lost to the penalty. Tech's second play was another rush by Thomas, who ran to the Tech 27-yard line for the game's first first <b>down.</b> <b>Once</b> there, DeShazo completed two consecutive passes, pushing Tech to their 45-yard line. Tech was able to continue the advance across midfield and into Indiana territory, but the Hoosiers' defense stiffened and denied Tech another first down. After a Hokie punt, Indiana began its second offensive drive at its 15-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Relations broke <b>down</b> <b>once</b> more in 1067 {{with the}} {{ascension}} of Emperor Shenzong of Song, {{and in the}} 1070s the Song had considerable success in capturing Tangut territory. A mood of frontier adventurism permeated Shenzong's court, {{as well as a}} desire to reclaim territories he felt belonged to him as the rightful ruler of China; when a Song general led an unprovoked attack on a Western Xia border town, Shenzong appeared at the border to commend the general himself. To punish the Western Xia and damage their economy, Emperor Shenzong also shut down all commercial border markets along the Song-Western Xia border. The scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031–1095) was sent to Yanzhou (now Yan'an, Shaanxi province) in 1080 to stave off Tangut military invasion. He successfully defended his fortified position, yet the new Grand Councillor Cai Que held him {{responsible for the death of}} a rival Song military officer and the decimation of that officer's forces; as a result, Shen Kuo was ousted from office and the state abandoned the projected land that Shen was able to defend.|$|E
