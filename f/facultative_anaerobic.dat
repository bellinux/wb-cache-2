25|$|Yersinia pestis (formerly Pasteurella pestis) is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} coccobacillus, non mobile with no spores. It is a <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobic</b> organism {{that can}} infect humans via the oriental rat flea. It causes the disease plague, which takes three main forms: pneumonic, septicemic, and bubonic plagues. All three forms {{were responsible for}} a number of high-mortality epidemics throughout human history, including: the 6th century's Plague of Justinian, the Black Death, which accounted for the death of at least one-third of the European population between 1347 and 1353, and the Third Pandemic, sometimes referred to as the Modern Plague, which began in the late 19th century in China and spread by rats on steamboats claiming close to 10 million lives. These plagues probably originated in China and were transmitted west via trade routes.|$|E

30|$|Aerobic {{bacteria}} rapidly produce emulsifiers utilizing sufficient {{nutrients and}} O 2 in the aerobic stage. After that, <b>facultative</b> and <b>anaerobic</b> bacteria became dominant and emulsifier production decreased; therefore, no further significant decrease of surface tension was observed.

Continuous supply of nutrients and O 2 to an oil reservoir would contribute to the production of a greater amount of emulsifiers.|$|R
25|$|In 1924, he {{returned}} without his wife {{but with an}} Oxford undergraduate, Noel Gillespie, as assistant. Everything was heavily decayed, and building and doctoring progressed together for months. He now had salvarsan for treating syphilitic ulcers and framboesia. Additional medical staff, nurse (Miss) Kottmann and Dr. Victor Nessmann, joined him in 1924, and Dr. Mark Lauterberg in 1925; the growing hospital was manned by native orderlies. Later Dr. Trensz replaced Nessmann, and Martha Lauterberg and Hans Muggenstorm joined them. Joseph also returned. In 1925-6, new hospital buildings were constructed, and also a ward for white patients, so that the site became like a village. The onset of famine and a dysentery epidemic created fresh problems. Much of the building work was carried out {{with the help of}} local people and patients. Drug advances for sleeping sickness included Germanin and tryparsamide. Trensz conducted experiments showing that the non-amoebic strain of dysentery was caused by a paracholera vibrion (<b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobic</b> bacteria). With the new hospital built and the medical team established, Schweitzer returned to Europe in 1927, this time leaving a functioning hospital at work.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae form large colonies (>0.5cm) after 24 {{hours of}} incubation, and produce haemolysis on blood agar; SDSD is alpha-haemolytic, whereas SDSE is {{predominantly}} beta-haemolytic. They are <b>facultative</b> <b>anaerobic,</b> incapable of respiratory metabolism, but are aerotolerant. Growth {{is enhanced by}} incubation in 5% CO2 atmosphere, but they usually grow adequately in ambient air. The optimum temperature for growth is approximately 37° Celsius. Lancefield group C and G carbohydrate antigens are predominantly expressed, but group A and L have been documented. However, the above characteristics are not unique to S.dysgalactiae, and further testing is required to confirm the species identity. Although many laboratories currently identify bacteria by mass-spectrometry (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/ionization Time Of Flight (MALDI TOF MS), phenotypic testing is still widely used. Unlike Streptococcus pyogenes (harbouring Lancefield group A antigen), S.dysgalactiae is PYR-negative and Bacitracin resistant. The distinction from the Streptococcus anginosus group (Lancefield A, C, G or F) {{can be made by}} colony size and Voges Proskauer test (VP); the S.anginosus group being VP positive.

40|$|Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are infections {{related to}} {{receiving}} medical care. HAIs {{are responsible for}} an excess {{of morbidity and mortality}} among hospitalized patients. Though most HAIs rates are on the decline, Clostridium difficile infection rates are at an all-time high, primarily due to the persistence of C. difficile spores in the environment. In the United States, Clostridium difficile-related mortality rates per million have increased from 5. 7 in 1999 to 23. 7 in 2004, with an estimated 26, 642 deaths due to Clostridium difficile infections (CDIs). Clostridium difficile is transmitted via the fecal-oral route or aerosolized endospores, {{but it can also be}} transmitted from high touch surfaces in healthcare facilities, such as door handles, bed rails, and bed pans contaminated with C. difficile spores. Various methods of detection have been established since the 1970 s, but they have limitations, such as cost, time, and availability. The use of a molecular method of detection, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), could provide more rapid and sensitive results for the detection of Clostridium difficile. The objective of this study was to determine the presence of Clostridium difficile pre- and post-decontamination of patients’ rooms in a healthcare facility environment using culture and PCR analysis of surface samples. No culturable C. difficile were detected; however, the culture analysis results showed a significant difference between the number of <b>facultative</b> and <b>anaerobic</b> bacteria in pre-decontamination samples and post-decontamination samples (Z = - 5. 852, p = 0. 000). Of the 128 samples tested using PCR analysis, five samples were positive for Clostridium difficile DNA (3. 9 %); three were from pre-decontamination samples and two were from post-decontamination samples. Reducing the rate of transmission of Clostridium difficile infections in hospitals is dependent on a number of factors (e. g., proper use of antibiotics, environmental decontamination, and proper hand-hygiene). The results of this study indicate decontamination methods used at these facilities were effective in preventing environmental contamination of hospital rooms with <b>facultative</b> and <b>anaerobic</b> bacteria such as, C. difficile...|$|R
