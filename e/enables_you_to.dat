He {{praised the}} {{improved}} controls, and the enhancements {{made to the}} game engine, concluding [...] "If you liked the original Myth, you'll love this. Graphically, Soulblighter is much better, and there's not much wrong with the gameplay. There's a fine single-player game to get your teeth into, and an easily workable multiplayer alternative to back it up. There's even a campaign editor which <b>enables</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> make your own missions.

2500|$|In {{a review}} of Google Drive after its launch in April 2012, Dan Grabham of TechRadar wrote that the {{integration}} of Google Docs into Google Drive was [...] "a bit confusing", mainly due to {{the differences in the}} user interfaces (UI) between the two, where Drive offers a [...] "My Drive" [...] section with a specific [...] "Shared with me" [...] view for shared documents. He stated that [...] "We think the user interface needs a lot more work. It's like a retread of Google Docs at the moment and Google surely needs to do work here". He considered uploading files [...] "fairly easy", but noted that folder upload was only supported through the Google Chrome web browser. The lack of native editing of Microsoft Office documents was [...] "annoying". Regarding Google Drive's computer apps, he stated that the option in Settings to synchronize only specific folders was [...] "powerful". He wrote that Drive was [...] "a great addition to Google armoury of apps and everything does work seamlessly", while again criticizing the interface for being [...] "confusing" [...] and that the file view was [...] "not quite intuitive enough" [...] without file icons. Grabham also reviewed the mobile Android app, writing that [...] "it's a pretty simple app that <b>enables</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> access your files on the move and save some for offline access should you wish", and praised Google Docs creation and photo uploading for being [...] "easy". He also praised that [...] "everything is easily searchable".|$|E

60|$|There can {{be little}} doubt, {{generally}} speaking, {{that it is more}} satisfactory to pass Sunday in the country than in town. There is something in the essential stillness of country-life, which blends harmoniously with the ordinance of the most divine of our divine laws. It is pleasant, too, when the congregation breaks up, to greet one's neighbors; to say kind words to kind faces; to hear some rural news profitable to learn, which sometimes <b>enables</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> do some good, and sometimes prevents others from doing some harm. A quiet, domestic walk, too, in the afternoon, has its pleasures; and so numerous and so various are the sources of interest in the country, that, though it be Sunday, {{there is no reason why}} your walk should not have an object.|$|E
