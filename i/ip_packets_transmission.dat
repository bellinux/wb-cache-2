40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} the resiliency to jamming of data protocols, such as IP, over Wireless LAN. We show that, on existing WLAN, an adversary can jam this protocol {{at a very}} low energy cost. Such attacks enable a set of adversary nodes disseminated over a geographical area to prevent communication, partition an ad hoc network, or force packets to be routed over adversary chosen paths. The ratio of the jamming pulses duration to the transmission duration can be as low as 10 - 4. We investigate and analyze the performance of using various coding schemes to improve the robustness of wireless LANs for <b>IP</b> <b>packets</b> <b>transmission.</b> We propose a concatenated code that is simple to decode and can maintain a low Frame Error Rate (FER) under a jamming effort ratio of 15 %. We investigate the theoretical limits by analyzing the performance derived from upper bounds on binary error-control codes. We also propose an efficient anti-jamming technique for IEEE 802. 11 b standard. ...|$|E

In the conventional soft handoff scheme, the downlink throughput performance decreases due to fading fluc-tuations, {{this is because the}} base station transmits packets to mobile stations even in bad channel con-ditions.

40|$|Abstract — The {{bandwidth}} {{of multiple}} physical communication links can be aggregated with inverse multiplexing {{to create a}} single, higher capacity logical communication link. However, achieving the maximum possible aggregated bandwidth becomes challenging as the communication characteristics of the underlying links (e. g., available bandwidth, packet loss rate) change with time. In this paper we introduce NATALIE, a Network-aware traffic equalizer. NATALIE combines an arbitrary set of network interfaces and schedules <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> <b>transmissions</b> over those interfaces in a weighted round-robin fashion. To achieve the maximum possible throughput, NATALIE measures the communication characteristics of the underlying links and dynamically adjusts its scheduler to assign packets to each link in proportion to its available capacity. We describe NATALIE’s implementation, the test environment we built on the Emulab Network Testbed, {{and the results of}} experiments demonstrating NATALIE’s throughput performance for TCP connections over diverse underlying links with cross-traffic. 1 I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple RLC/MAC protocol architecture for a wireless IP (Internet Protocol) network. In {{order to support}} IP-based multimedia services in a wireless network, two different approaches can be used. One approach is to transmit end-to-end <b>IP</b> <b>packets</b> in a multi-hop network, such as a cellular mobile telephone network. In this case <b>IP</b> <b>packets</b> can be transmitted on high data rate air interfaces using a suitable IP header compression technique. Another possibility is to transmit non-IP packets from a UE to a BTS using standard 2 G/ 3 G air interfaces. <b>IP</b> <b>packets</b> can be generated at a BTS by encapsulating received MAC packets on an uplink. On a downlink, an <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> received from a RAN is fragmented at a BTS for further transmission using a standard air interface. This paper first reviews the end-to-end <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> <b>transmission</b> strategy based on IP header compression techniques. Next a simple RLC/MAC protocol architecturefor a wireless IP network is proposed. The proposed protocol architecture is suitable for generating <b>IP</b> <b>packets</b> at a BTS by encapsulating MAC <b>packets.</b> <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> encapsulation delay at a BTS is minimized by using a reservation-based MAC protocol. The MAC protocol uses class-based reservation and priority queuing techniques to satisfy QoS needs of different classes of traffic. The RLC protocol is mapped onto the MAC protocol to minimize signaling overhead. The proposed RLC/MAC layer is simple, flexible, and generates minimum signaling load to maintain high QoS for multimedia traffic. Performance of the RLC/MAC protocol is analyzed using a simulation model...|$|R
40|$|TCP Wave is an {{innovative}} transport protocol adopting a burst-based transmission approach, {{instead of the}} traditional window-based one. In TCP Wave the underlying <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> <b>transmission</b> process results completely changed because of an internal timer to schedule bursts, which replaces the ACK- clocked transmission of all TCP versions. So far, TCP Wave capabilities have been assessed in a large gamut of scenarios but mainly limited to unidirectional bulk-like transfers involving a TCP sender and a TCP receiver. In this paper, TCP Wave behavior and performance are evaluated {{for the first time}} with real HTTP running applications, which are characterized by: a request/response interactive traffic model, a short and, in some cases, spaced objects transmissions and a mutual role of TCP peers that can act either as sender or receiver according to the application operations.

40|$|A {{method and}} a {{computer}} program for reducing jitter in <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> <b>transmission</b> in a Diffserv network having ingress and egress Border Routers and using premium service, expedited forwarding and source route option, recognize incoming packets which have firm jitter requirements. The program verifies if a recognized packet has an entry in the forwarding cache for its IP destination address. If affirmative, the identified packet {{is sent to the}} next hop. If not, the program checks to see if a route table entry exists for the specified destination address. If affirmative, the route table entry is stored in the forwarding cache, and the packet is sent on its way. Otherwise, the program uses special filters to extract and select the shortest and fastest path to an egress border router to match the destination address; a list of selected router addresses is inserted as part of a source route option. All intermediate routers receiving a packet with the strict source route option set will forward the packet to the first address in the strict source option list. Subsequent packets which follow after the recognized packet and are bound to the same destination address will be sent in the same path as the identified first packet with the source route option turned off. The method ensures reduced jitter for packets having firm jitter requirements in a network using either static or dynamic routing.

40|$|The {{popularity}} of Voice over the Internet Protocol (VoIP) for providing voice communication over IP networks {{such as the}} Internet has resulted in VoIP becoming a global telephony service. VoIP applications convert analogue voice signals into a digital format, which is then encapsulated into <b>IP</b> <b>packets</b> for <b>transmission</b> over the Internet. Our research has examined both the security and privacy implications of widespread adoption of VoIP for personal and business telecommunications and also the use of VoIP calls by criminals, as many implementations of VoIP may also use strong encryption to secure both the voice payload {{as well as to}} control messages.

30|$|Only {{few studies}} in {{literature}} aimed {{to prove the}} applicability of NEMO in WSNs and compared its efficiency to the host-based MIPv 6 protocol. For example, Kim et al. [23] presented the Sensor NEMO (SNEMO) protocol, {{which is the first}} interoperable architecture between 6 LoWPAN and NEMO protocols. They enhanced the LOAD routing protocol to support mobility in 6 LoWPAN by improving the default gateway discovery, mobile network discovery, and path optimization. SNEMO is beneficial to mobile 6 LoWPAN, but it does not allow the mobility of individual nodes. Kim et al. [22] devised a lightweight NEMO that supports 6 LoWPAN by designing a mobility header compression format to minimize signaling cost. However, they did not assign a unique address for each sensor node and they did not consider node mobility. Chai et al. [24] investigated the application of the NEMO protocol in WSNs using several types of protocols that support <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> <b>transmission,</b> including 6 LoWPAN, IPv 6 over ZIGBEE, and the packet translation scheme. They concluded that NEMO can easily be applied to WSN using 6 LoWPAN and IPv 6 over ZIGBEE, but the characteristics of WSNs exhibit difficulties upon implementation. On the other hand, packet translation can support NEMO without adopting IP protocol in the network layer by introducing the mobile gateway node. Chai et al. [25] discussed the application of the NEMO protocol for supporting group mobility in WSN, proposed a network architecture that supports the integration of NEMO and 6 LoWPAN, and presented the related the signaling process, including the registration at the home network, association negotiation, handoff between different ARs, and packet routing. They compared the node remaining energy and the handoff time of MIPv 6 and NEMO protocols with each other. Their results show that the handoff signaling of NEMO was 1 /N times smaller than that of MIPv 6, where N is the number of MNs, consequently making the remaining energy of MIPv 6 much less than that of NEMO. However, the selected node as a sensor router consumed more energy because its signaling and data transmission are larger compared with those of other sensors. Thus, they suggested the use of non-power aware devices as sensor routers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Wireless mesh {{networks}} (WMNs) are wireless multihop networks {{comprised of}} mesh routers, which relay traffic {{on behalf of}} clients and other nodes. Using the standard IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function (DCF) as MAC layer, a node needs to contend for the medium each time it wants to transmit a packet. This creates high overhead in particular for small packets and leads to poor performance for real-time applications such as Voice over IP (VoIP) or online gaming. Burst <b>packet</b> <b>transmission</b> can increase the efficiency. For example, with the Transmission Opportunity limit (TXOPlimit) in IEEE 802. 11 e, a station may transfer several packets without contending for the channel in between. Similarly, <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> aggregation combines several <b>IP</b> <b>packets</b> together and sends them as one MAC Service Data Unit. Originally, both schemes {{have been developed for}} singlehop networks only. Thus the impact on WMNs is unclear if the packets need to contend over multiple hops. In this paper, we use measurements from a 9 -node WMN testbed to compare TXOPs and <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> aggregation for VoIP in terms of fairness, network capacity and quality of user experience. We show that for low networks loads, both TXOPs and <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> aggregation increase the VoIP quality compared to IEEE 802. 11 DCF. However, in highly loaded networks <b>IP</b> <b>packet</b> aggregation outperforms the other schemes. I...|$|R
