500|$|On March 9, 2015, it was {{announced}} through Twitter that {{a version of the}} game for Nintendo's Wii U console was planned for release on the eShop online store for late 2015, later specified as August 13. A demo was released as part of a promotion titled [...] "Nindies@home", wherein players were invited to try several upcoming Wii U games between June 15 and June 22. On July 28, however, GalaxyTrail confirmed that production of {{the final version of the}} game was taking longer than expected, suggesting that the game's actual release would be later. DiDuro announced the cause of the delay on August 18: the Wii U version had been set back by a [...] "console-freezing bug", which would postpone the Wii U release indefinitely until the issue was fixed. It was later explained that the bug had taken so long to detect because it only occurred in retail versions of the console, which had prevented GalaxyTrail and Nintendo from learning of the issue. The bug required a <b>hard</b> <b>reset</b> of the system to address the problem, which could potentially cause damage to the Wii U hardware. The bug was eventually fixed, and the game was released on the eShop on October 1; customers who had tried the game's demo were rewarded with a 15-percent discount.|$|E

2500|$|At the time, World of Warcraft {{had more}} than two million players all over the world. Before Blizzard Entertainment commented on the outbreak, there was debate whether it was {{intentional}} or a glitch. On Blizzard's forums, posters were commenting about how it was a fantastic world event, and calling it [...] "the day the plague wiped out Ironforge." [...] An editor of a World of Warcraft fan site described it as the first proper world event. After the incident began, Blizzard received calls from angry customers complaining about how they just died. Some players abandoned the game altogether until the problem was fixed.

25|$|During the epidemic, normal {{gameplay}} was disrupted. Player responses varied but resembled real-world behaviors. Some {{characters with}} healing abilities volunteered their services, some lower-level characters {{who could not}} help would direct people away from infected areas, some characters would flee to uninfected areas, and some characters attempted to spread the disease to others. Players in the game reacted to the disease {{as if there were}} real risk to their well-being. Blizzard Entertainment attempted to institute a voluntary quarantine to stem the disease, but it failed, as some players didn't take it seriously, while others took advantage of the pandemonium. Despite certain security measures, players overcame them by giving the disease to summonable pets. Blizzard was forced to fix the problem by instituting <b>hard</b> <b>resets</b> of the servers and applying quick fixes.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new wireless platform designed for an integrated traffic monitoring {{system based on}} combined Lagrangian (mobile) and Eulerian (fixed) sensing. The sensor platform is built around a 32 -bit ARM Cortex M 4 micro-controller and a 2. 4 GHz 802. 15. 4 ISM compliant radio module, and can be interfaced with fixed traffic sensors, or receive data from vehicle transponders. The platform is specially designed and optimized to be integrated in a solar-powered wireless sensor network in which traffic flow maps are computed by the nodes directly using distributed computing. A MPPT circuitry is proposed to increase the power output of the attached solar panel.

5000|$|Operating the pixel via <b>hard</b> <b>reset</b> {{results in}} a Johnson-Nyquist noise on the {{photodiode}} of [...] or , but prevents image lag, sometimes a desirable tradeoff. One way to use <b>hard</b> <b>reset</b> is replace Mrst with a p-type transistor and invert the polarity of the RST signal. The presence of the p-type device reduces fill factor, as extra space is required between p- and n-devices; it also removes {{the possibility of using}} the reset transistor as an overflow anti-blooming drain, which is a commonly exploited benefit of the n-type reset FET. Another way to achieve <b>hard</b> <b>reset,</b> with the n-type FET, is to lower the voltage of VRST relative to the on-voltage of RST. This reduction may reduce headroom, or full-well charge capacity, but does not affect fill factor, unless VDD is then routed on a separate wire with its original voltage.|$|E

50|$|Techniques such as flushed reset, pseudo-flash reset, and hard-to-soft reset combine {{soft and}} <b>hard</b> <b>reset.</b> The details {{of these methods}} differ, but the basic idea is the same. First, a <b>hard</b> <b>reset</b> is done, {{eliminating}} image lag. Next, a soft reset is done, causing a low noise reset without adding any lag. Pseudo-flash reset requires separating VRST from VDD, while the other two techniques add more complicated column circuitry. Specifically, pseudo-flash reset and hard-to-soft reset both add transistors between the pixel power supplies and the actual VDD. The result is lower headroom, without affecting fill factor.|$|E
5000|$|A {{watchdog}} timer will perform a <b>hard</b> <b>reset</b> {{of a system}} unless some sequence is performed that generally indicates the system is alive, such as a write operation from an onboard processor. During normal operation, software schedules a write to the {{watchdog timer}} at regular intervals to prevent the timer from running out. If radiation causes the processor to operate incorrectly, it is unlikely the software will work correctly enough to clear the watchdog timer. The watchdog eventually times out and forces a <b>hard</b> <b>reset</b> to the system. This is considered a last resort to other methods of radiation hardening.|$|E

Surprisingly, several problems related to boundedness are <b>harder</b> for <b>Reset</b> nets than for the more expressive Transfer nets. Our main result is that boundedness is undecidable for nets with three reset arcs, while it is decidable for nets with two resetable places. 1 Introduction "Infinite-state transition systems" is a generic name for a large collection of computational models that go beyond finite-state systems but where some decidability results exist. These infinite systems (for short) are currently under active study for several reasons. First some applications use models that cannot easily be abstracted into finite-state systems (e. g., hybrid systems). Then, some models only go beyond finite-state in a very specific way (e. g., parameterized systems, lossy channel systems). Finally, verification methods designed for infinite-state systems may help understand where and how [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{dynamical}} {{model of}} smooth muscle cells in an arterial wall, {{defined as a}} system of coupled five-dimensional nonlinear oscillators, on a grid with cylindrical symmetry, we compare the admissible activity patterns with those known from the heart tissue. We postulate on numerical basis the possibility to induce a stable spiral wave in the arterial wall. Such a spiral wave can inhibit the propagation of the axial calcium wave and effectively stop the vasomotion. We also discuss {{the dynamics of the}} circumferential calcium wave in comparison to rotors in venous ostia that are a common source of supraventricular ectopy. We show that the velocity and in consequence the frequency range of the circumferential calcium wave is by orders of magnitude too small compared to that of the rotors. The mechanism of the rotor is not likely to involve the calcium-related dynamics of the smooth muscle cells. The calcium-related dynamics which is voltage-independent and <b>hard</b> to be <b>reset</b> seems to actually protect the blood vessels against the electric activity of the atria. We also discuss the microreentry phenomenon, which was found in numerical experiments in the studied model. Teodor Buchner, Jakub Pietkun and Pawel Kukli...|$|R
