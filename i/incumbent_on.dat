5|$|On 22 August 1978, Kenyatta {{died in the}} State House, Mombasa. As {{a result}} of the UK's longstanding {{experience}} in state funerals, the Kenyan government requested British assistance in organising Kenyatta's. McKenzie was employed as a go-between, and the structure of the funeral was orchestrated to deliberately imitate that of deceased British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. In doing so, senior Kenyans sought to project an image of their country as a modern nation-state rather than one <b>incumbent</b> <b>on</b> tradition. The funeral took place at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, six days after Kenyatta's death. Britain's first heir to the throne, Charles, Prince of Wales, attended the event, a symbol of the value that the British government perceived in its relationship with Kenya.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to the Zionists' use of Rabbi Chaim Vital (see above), the Satmar Rebbe argued that Vital's remarks refer not to the Three Oaths <b>incumbent</b> <b>on</b> the Jewish people, but to God's oath not to redeem the Jewish people unless they repent out of love. This oath lasts a thousand years; after that point even repentance out of fear can bring the redemption.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, Richards {{ran against}} and {{defeated}} a three-term <b>incumbent</b> <b>on</b> the four-member Travis County, Texas Commissioners' Court; she took 81.4 {{percent of the}} vote against Libertarian opponent Laurel Freeman to win re-election in 1980. During this time, her marriage ended, {{in part because of the}} strain of politics on the relationship. Richards' drinking became more pronounced, and she sought and completed treatment for alcoholism in 1980.|$|E
25|$|The Five Pillars of Islam (Arabic: أركان الإسلام) is {{the term}} given to the five duties <b>incumbent</b> <b>on</b> every Muslim. These duties are Shahada (profession of faith), salat (prayers), Zakāt (giving of alms), Sawm (fasting, {{specifically}} during Ramadan) and Hajj (pilgrimage to Mecca). These five practices are essential to Sunni and Shia Muslims. Shia theology has two concepts that define religion as a whole. There are Roots of Religion (Usūl al-Dīn) and Branches of Religion (Furu al Din).|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} Rabbinical Jewish {{belief is}} that the observance of these commandments and the other mitzvot are required solely of the Jewish people and that the laws <b>incumbent</b> <b>on</b> humanity in general are outlined in the seven Noahide laws, several of which overlap with the Ten Commandments. In {{the era of the}} Sanhedrin transgressing any one of six of the Ten Commandments theoretically carried the death penalty, the exceptions being the First Commandment, honouring your father and mother, saying God's name in vain, and coveting, though this was rarely enforced due to a large number of stringent evidentiary requirements imposed by the oral law.|$|E
25|$|The Muslim Brotherhood's reemergence as a {{political}} force coincided {{with the proliferation of}} Islamic groups. Some of these groups espoused the violent overthrow of the government while others espoused living a devout life of rigorous observance of religious practices. It is impossible to list all the Islamic groups that emerged in the late 1970s because many of them had diffuse structures and some of the more militant groups were underground. Egypt's defeat and loss of territory in the June 1967 Six-Day War was the main cause for the growth of religiously inspired political activism. Muslims tended to view the humiliating experience as the culmination of 150 years of foreign intrusion and an affront to their vision of a true Islamic community. Islamic tradition rejected the idea of non-Muslims dominating Muslim society. Such a state of affairs discredited Muslim rulers who permitted it to persist. It was, therefore, <b>incumbent</b> <b>on</b> believers to end the domination and restore the true supremacy of Islam. As part of their Sunni creed, the most radical activists adopted jihad and committed themselves to battling unbelievers and impious Muslims. During the 1970s and 1980s, Islamists perpetrated a number of violent acts, including the assassination of Anwar Sadat in October 1981.|$|E

The paper was then signed by the men present: the prince, Coventry, Williams, Wilson and his son, both Somersets, Lycett Green, Levett and Sassoon. Although the prince hoped that this would bring an end to the affair, Arthur Somerset pointed out that it would not remain secret. Edward asked him [...] "not even when gentlemen have given their word not to divulge it?"; Somerset replied that [...] "It is impossible, sir. Nothing in the world known to ten people was ever kept secret".|$|E
500|$|Cibber's {{appointment}} as Poet Laureate in December 1730 was widely {{assumed to be}} a political rather than artistic honour, and a reward for his untiring support of the Whigs, the party of Prime Minister Robert Walpole. Most of the leading writers, such as Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, and Henry Fielding, were excluded from contention for the laureateship because they were Tories. Cibber's verses had few admirers even in his own time, and Cibber acknowledged cheerfully that he did not think much of them. His 30 birthday odes for the royal family and other duty pieces <b>incumbent</b> <b>on</b> him as Poet Laureate came in for particular scorn, and these offerings would regularly be followed by a flurry of anonymous parodies, some of which Cibber claimed in his Apology to have written himself. In the 20th century, D. B. Wyndham-Lewis and Charles Lee considered some of Cibber's laureate poems funny enough to be included in their classic [...] "anthology of bad verse", The Stuffed Owl (1930). However, Cibber was at least as distinguished as his immediate four predecessors, three of whom were also playwrights rather than poets.|$|E

This research pioneers the empirical study of low-cost carrier fare responses to new entries. Further, the study is interesting because it is applied to Europe, where public data on fares are not generally available and the low-cost phenomenon is relatively recent compared to the U.S. Because the strategies employed by low-cost carriers are extremely dynamic, we focus our attention on short-term fare reactions. Specifically, we applied an event-study approach within a time window of 7  days before and after each entry.|$|R

500|$|Representative {{democracy}} {{has been described}} as [...] "a system of government where the people in free elections elect their representatives to the legislative chamber which occupies the most powerful position in the political system". The meaning of the term was discussed in the Parliament of Singapore on 27 August 2008 upon a motion moved by Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann, a professor of constitutional law at the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law, for the House to affirm the importance of representative democracy and to call on the Government to amend the Parliamentary Elections Act to make the calling of by-elections mandatory in Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) in certain situations. According to Thio, under the view of representative democracy taken by the 18th-century British Member of Parliament (MP) and philosopher Edmund Burke, [...] "an MP is no mere delegate who simply mouths his constituents' views. An MP is chosen for his 'mature judgment' and 'enlightened conscience.'" [...] Thus, an MP [...] "has to represent his constituents in tending to municipal affairs", but also [...] "be concerned with national affairs", and, [...] "as a party member, he must toe the party line". In addition, an MP of a minority ethnic group in a GRC [...] "has to carry the concerns of his particular minority community as well". For this reason, she felt that if the seat of a minority MP in a GRC became vacant, it should be <b>incumbent</b> <b>on</b> the Government to call a by-election to fill it.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that distraction and mind-wandering are related, perhaps causally, to the experience of boredom. This study assessed the impact of frequency and justifiability of non-task related thoughts by job <b>incumbents</b> <b>on</b> observers’ attributions about incumbent boredom, job satisfaction, and perceptions of task characteristics. Job level was also manipulated. It was predicted that more frequent and less justifiable non-task-related thoughts would be associated with attributions of greater boredom, less satisfaction, and poorer job characteristics, especially for higher level jobs. The results supported the predictions for the effects of frequency and justifiability of non-task-related thoughts on boredom and satisfaction for both job levels...|$|R
