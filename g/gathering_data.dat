40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{investigate}} the fundamental properties of <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> in wireless sensor networks, {{in terms of}} both capacity and latency. We consider a scenario in which s(n) out of n total network nodes have to deliver data to a set of d(n) sink nodes at a constant rate λ(n, s(n), d(n)). The goal is to characterize the maximum achievable rate, and the latency in data delivery. We present a simple <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> scheme that achieves asymptotically optimal <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> capacity and latency with arbitrary network deployments when d(n) = 1, and for most scaling regimes of s(n) and d(n) when d(n) > 1 in case of square grid and random node deployments. Differently from most previous work, our results and the presented <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> scheme do not sacrifice energy efficiency to the need of maximizing capacity and minimizing latency. Finally, we consider the effects of a simple form of data aggregation on <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> performance, and show that capacity can be increased by a factor f(n) with respect to the case of no data aggregation, where f(n) is the node density. To the best of our knowledge, the ones presented in this paper are the first results showing that asymptotically optimal <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> capacity and latency can be achieved in arbitrary networks in an energy efficient way.

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>gathering</b> {{is a key}} {{operator}} {{for applications}} in wireless sensor networks; yet {{it is also a}} challenging problem in mobile sensor networks when considering that all nodes are mobile and the communications among them are opportunistic. This paper proposes an efficient <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> scheme called ADG that adopts speedy mobile elements as the mobile data collector and takes advantage of the movement patterns of the network. ADG first extracts the network meta-data at initial epochs, and calculates a set of proxy nodes based on the meta-data. <b>Data</b> <b>gathering</b> is then mapped into the Proxy node Time Slot Allocation (PTSA) problem that schedules the time slots and orders, according to which the data collector could gather the maximal amount of data within a limited period. Finally, the collector follows the schedule and picks up the sensed data from the proxy nodes through one hop of message transmissions. ADG learns the period when nodes are relatively stationary, so that the collector is able to pick up the data from them during the limited <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> period. Moreover, proxy nodes and <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> points could also be timely updated so that the collector could adapt to the change of node movements. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheme outperforms other <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> schemes on the cost of message transmissions and the <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> rate, especially under the constraint of limited <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> period...|$|R

Jefferson included extensive data about the state's natural resources and economy, and wrote at length about slavery, miscegenation, and his belief that blacks and whites could not live together as free people in one society because of justified resentments of the enslaved.

The problem was traced to a software error, which deactivated attitude thrusters causing the spacecrafts' solar arrays to no longer point at the Sun, depleting Phobos 1 batteries. Phobos 2 operated normally throughout its cruise and Mars orbital insertion phases on January 29, 1989, <b>gathering</b> <b>data</b> on the Sun, interplanetary medium, Mars, and Phobos. Shortly before the final phase of the mission, during which the spacecraft was to approach within 50 m of Phobos' surface and release two landers, one a mobile 'hopper', the other a stationary platform, contact with Phobos 2 was lost. The mission ended when the spacecraft signal failed to be successfully reacquired on March 27, 1989. The cause of the failure was determined to be a malfunction of the on-board computer.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{evidence}} of the pernicious nature of opium use was largely undocumented in the 1890s, when Protestant missionaries in China decided to strengthen {{their opposition to the}} trade by compiling data which would demonstrate the harm the drug did. Faced with the problem that many Chinese associated Christianity with opium, partly due to the arrival of early Protestant missionaries on opium clippers, at the 1890 Shanghai Missionary Conference, they agreed to establish the Permanent Committee for the Promotion of Anti-Opium Societies in an attempt to overcome this problem and to arouse public opinion against the opium trade. The members of the committee were John Glasgow Kerr, MD, American Presbyterian Mission in Canton; B.C. Atterbury, MD, American Presbyterian Mission in Peking; Archdeacon Arthur E. Moule, Church Missionary Society in Shanghai; Henry Whitney, MD, American Board of Commissioners for foreign Missions in Foochow; the Rev. Samuel Clarke, China Inland Mission in Kweiyang; the Rev. Arthur Gostick Shorrock, English Baptist Mission in Taiyuan; and the Rev. Griffith John, London Mission Society in Hankow. These missionaries were generally outraged over the British government's Royal Commission on Opium visiting India but not China. Accordingly, the missionaries first organized the Anti-Opium League in China among their colleagues in every mission station in China. American missionary Hampden Coit DuBose acted as first president. This organization, which had elected national officers and held an annual national meeting, was instrumental in <b>gathering</b> <b>data</b> from every Western-trained medical doctor in China, which was then published as William Hector Park compiled Opinions of Over 100 Physicians on the Use of Opium in China (Shanghai: American Presbyterian Mission Press, 1899). The vast majority of these medical doctors were missionaries; the survey also included doctors who were in private practices, particularly in Shanghai and Hong Kong, as well as Chinese who had been trained in medical schools in Western countries. In England, the home director of the China Inland Mission, Benjamin Broomhall, was an active opponent of the opium trade, writing two books to promote the banning of opium smoking: The Truth about Opium Smoking and The Chinese Opium Smoker. In 1888, Broomhall formed and became secretary of the Christian Union for the Severance of the British Empire with the Opium Traffic and editor of its periodical, National Righteousness. He lobbied the British Parliament to stop the opium trade. He and James Laidlaw Maxwell appealed to the London Missionary Conference of 1888 and the Edinburgh Missionary Conference of 1910 to condemn the continuation of the trade. When Broomhall was dying, his son Marshall read to him from The Times the welcome news that an agreement had been signed ensuring the end of the opium trade within two years.|$|E
