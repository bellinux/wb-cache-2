40|$|An optical mm-wave {{demultiplexer}} is presented. Double <b>sideband</b> <b>modulation</b> with suppressed optical {{carrier and}} filtering properties of dual overwritten fiber Bragg gratings are the fundamentals for optical demultiplexing of mm-wave radio-on-fiber signals: using a single optical carrier, Millimeter-wave signals of 20 and 40 GHz frequencies carrying independent data are created, transmitted over fiber, demultiplexed and wireless distributed to be detected and data recovered in a mobile unit. Double <b>sideband</b> <b>modulation</b> with suppressed optical carrier yields no power penalty due to chromatic dispersion, while the filtering {{properties of the}} dual overwritten fiber Bragg gratings allow less than − 40 dB electrical power interchannel leakage.

40|$|Abstract—We show, using simulations, that a {{combination}} of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and op-tical single <b>sideband</b> <b>modulation</b> can be used to compensate for chromatic dispersion in ultralong-haul wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) systems. OFDM provides a high spectral effi-ciency, does not require a reverse feedback path for compensation, and has a better sensitivity than nonreturn to zero. This paper pro-vides design rules for 800 – 4000 -km optical-OFDM systems. The effects of WDM channel number and spacing, fiber dispersion, and input power per channel on the received Q are studied using extensive numerical simulations. These effects are summarized as a set of design rules.

40|$|Abstract—Co-based alloys were {{investigated}} as candidates for sputtered thin-film magnetic tape media. Magnetic media on polymeric substrates having acceptable magnetic properties {{were obtained by}} applying NiAl/CrMn underlayers prior to CoCrPt deposition with a nonmagnetic CoCrTa intermediate layer. Typical sputtered tape media deposited on traditional polymeric substrates at room temperature revealed <b>sideband</b> <b>modulation</b> noise and large intergranular exchange coupling. A substantial improvement in surface roughness by utilizing smooth polymeric substrates eliminated this modulation noise and accounted for the signal dependent broad-band noise power. This suggests that transition noise is a dominant component of medium noise in sputtered tape media. Additionally, substrate bias is shown {{to be effective in}} producing grain decoupling that is necessary for good signal-to-noise ratio.

50|$|Given all {{of these}} parameters, {{the result is a}} mostly-continuous analog signal which can be {{modulated}} onto a radio-frequency carrier and transmitted through an antenna. All analog television systems use vestigial <b>sideband</b> <b>modulation,</b> a form of amplitude modulation in which one sideband is partially removed. This reduces the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, enabling narrower channels to be used.|$|R

50|$|Example 4: The 8VSB (8-level vestigial <b>sideband)</b> <b>modulation</b> scheme {{used in the}} ATSC digital {{television}} standard gives N=3 bit/symbol or bpcu. Since it {{can be described as}} nearly single-side band, the modulation efficiency is close to 2N = 6 (bit/s)/Hz. In practice, ATSC transfers a gross bit rate of 32 Mbit/s over a 6 MHz wide channel, resulting in a modulation efficiency of 32/6 = 5.3 (bit/s)/Hz.|$|R
25|$|The DVB-T {{standard}} {{is not used}} for terrestrial digital television in North America.
