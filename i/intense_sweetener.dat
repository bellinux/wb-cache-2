40|$|Sucrose can be {{substituted}} by <b>intense</b> <b>sweeteners</b> to lower the calorie content of soft drinks. Although the sweetness is kept {{at the same level}} as much as possible, the flavour of the product often changes. This change could be due to both the mechanism of sensory perception and interactive effects of the aroma compounds. Several types of interaction and some techniques for measuring interactive effects are reviewed. An example of psychological interaction is the influence of colour on flavour. Interactions of flavour molecules with the receptor can be affected by changes in their micro-environment. Molecular interactions {{play a role in the}} release of volatile compounds from aqueous solutions; release is increased by sugars and salts, and decreased by lipids and proteins. <b>Intense</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> such as aspartame and neohesperidine dihydrochalcone, interact with volatile compounds and modify the intensities of flavour attributes. The use of combinations of <b>intense</b> <b>sweeteners</b> can solve the flavour problems encountered with single sweetener applications. A quaternary model of Beidler's mixture equation was used to describe the sweetness of a light blackcurrant soft drink, containing the <b>intense</b> <b>sweeteners</b> saccharin, cyclamate, aspartame and acesulfam-K. The perceived sweetness of the light soft drink was lower than the sweetness of the original sucrose-sweetened soft drink.

Various sweeteners interact with either Tas 1 r 2 or Tas 1 r 3 and then activate the receptor. In this study, we cloned, expressed and functionally characterized the taste receptor Tas 1 r 2 from a species of Old World monkeys, the rhesus monkey. Paired with the human TAS 1 R 3, it was shown that the rhesus monkey Tas 1 r 2 could respond to natural sugars, amino acids and their derivates.

40|$|The {{shelf life}} of foods is a {{function}} of their composition, processing, packaging and environmental factors, most notably temperature. For dehydrated foods, end of shelf life is usually signaled by an unacceptable loss of sensory attributes. Since the time to reach this level of unacceptability, under normal storage conditions, is targeted to be 12 to 24 months, techniques of Accelerated Shelf Life Testing (ASLT) are employed to determine the shelf life of such products within a reasonable length of time. Use of Weibull Hazard Analysis facilitates the effective application of ASLT with sensory evaluation by allowing the use of a practical panel size and easy quantitation of the results. These can be used to model the shelf life behavior and to extrapolate from accelerated to normal conditions. The degradation of the <b>intense</b> <b>sweetener</b> aspartame was studied in a gelatin-based dessert with a fruity flavor. Tests were conducted at 45, 50 and 60 °C and the end of shelf life, expressed as unacceptably low level of sweetness, was determined by sensory evaluation as 70. 4, 51. 9 and 24. 3 days respectively. An activation energy of degradation of aspartame, EA, was calculated as 15. 1 kcal/mol, from which a shelf life for the product stored at 20 °C of 554 days was estimated. Sensory results correlated very well with HPLC measurements of the aspartame degradation giving practically the same EA, and showing that end of shelf life coincided in all cases with 60 % remaining aspartame. © 1998 Elsevier B.

The present work aimed at the optimisation and validation of an high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analytical method for cyclamate determination in tabletop sweeteners based on the procedure of European Standard EN 12857. The validated method was then applied to the determination of this sweetener in different types of tabletop sweeteners (liquid, powder and tablets). Both standards and samples solutions were submitted to a derivatisation procedure which converted cyclamate to N,N-dichlorocyclohexylamine. The derivatised product was separated and quantified using a reversed-phase column, a mobile phase composed of water (20 %) and methanol (80 %), isocratic flow of 1 mlmin(- 1), and detection by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at a wavelength of 314 nm. The analytical method was internally validated according to the following validation parameters: working range, linearity, limits of detection and quantification, sensitivity, precision (repeatability and intermediate precision), and uncertainty. This method proved to be specific and selective for the determination of this sweetener, showing repeatability, RSDr 3 %, intermediate precision, RSDR 3. 3 %, and recovery rates from 92 % to 108 % for the different tabletop sweeteners. The method uncertainty was 9. 4 %. The concentration of cyclamate in the samples varied significantly, from 2. 9 % to 73. 9 %, which demonstrated that a possible excessive consumption of one of the analysed sweeteners can lead to exceeding the acceptable daily intake for cyclamate. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Chocolate is a {{high energy}} product with carbohydrates, {{including}} sugar, together with fat, as the main sources of energy. Sucrose is utilized up to 30 - 60 % in chocolate and this confers multiple functional properties on chocolate including sweetness, bulkiness and mouthfeel (texture). Today’s consumers {{are concerned about the}} high sugar levels, calories and cariogenicity effects in confectionery products, hence growing the popularity of “light” and “sugar-free” products. This has led to the search for low calorie, low glycemic index, healthier alternatives. Polydextrose and inulin are considered as fibers with many interesting functional attributes that {{meet the needs of the}} food industry for healthy foods. Stevia and thaumatin are natural high potency (<b>intense)</b> <b>sweeteners</b> with sensory properties superior to those of other sweeteners. This research investigated the functionality of inulin and polydextrose as sucrose replacers (bulking agents) in sugar-free dark chocolates with stevia or thaumatin as <b>intense</b> <b>sweeteners.</b> The type of bulking agent and concentrations used greatly influenced the rheological properties, textural, melting behaviours and other physical quality characteristics of the developed sugar-free chocolates. Microstructural examination revealed that inulin, which had a lower density than polydextrose tend to have more solids per volume and increased particle volume fraction and solid’s surface area, resulting in a higher particle collision and aggregation thereby limiting chocolate flow.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{sweet taste}} of aspartame, saccharin, and acesulfame-K has been {{reported}} to increase ratings of hunger and, after saccharin consumption, to increase food intake.

Even if aspartame consumption increases ratings of hunger in some situations, it apparently has little impact on the controls of food intake and body weight. Aspartame has not been found to increase food intake; indeed, both short-term and long-term studies have shown that consumption of aspartame-sweetened foods or drinks is associated with either no change or a reduction in food intake. Preliminary clinical trials suggest that aspartame may be a useful aid in a complete diet-and-exercise program or in weight maintenance. <b>Intense</b> <b>sweeteners</b> have never been found to cause weight gain in humans.

However, many of them have little prospect of becoming commercial ingredients because, they do not meet some of the key criteria for commercial success. The stevia plant and its products have potential for commercial uses as sweetener or therapeutic. Beside the two known main molecules that are <b>intense</b> <b>sweeteners</b> that are occurring in stevia (stevioside and rebaudioside A), the plant contain other compounds of nutritional importance for therapeutic uses. The acceptable daily intake or ADI of 4 mg/kg bw/day to steviol glycosides have been regulated to glycosides of stevia. Moreover, there exists production of stevia worldwide, with established procedures for isolation and purification of its glycosides and one of them has been approved for food use. Then, a solid market of diabetes-oriented products must emerge, for satisfying demands from these consumers. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The aims of {{this paper}} are to review the {{literature}} on sucrose, commonly known as table sugar; to report as it appeared in Brazil and in the world; to discuss the differences between crystal and refined sucrose; to show {{the harmful effects of}} overconsumption; and to list their main sweeteners. Sucrose appeared over 7000 years ago and since then it has actively participated in the creation of new forms of food consumption, in the development of societies and in the social and political relations. Carbohydrates are the main source of energy for the body and considering that they are present in different foods, their consumption in excess can cause diseases such as obesity and diabetes. The amount of processed products with sucrose in its composition is uncountable and overconsumption has caused concern in the medical field. The manufacture of sugar is a process that involves a series of operations to obtain the final product. There are several kinds of sucrose that are available according to its use (domestic and industrial). The sweeteners can be used to sweeten, and may replace sucrose. Some of these compounds are known as <b>intense</b> <b>sweeteners,</b> being used in very small quantities, are indicated to people who have a disorder in the metabolism of sugars (diabetics) or consumers who are in search of products of low calorific value...|$|R
