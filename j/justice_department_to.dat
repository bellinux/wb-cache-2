5|$|Originally {{declared}} a police intervention against terrorists, {{the local media}} quickly questioned the officers' testimonies {{as well as the}} only surviving witness for inconsistencies. Although reluctant, Carlos Romero Barceló (PNP), then Governor of Puerto Rico, ordered the local <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>to</b> launch various investigations, and asked the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the US <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>to</b> aid in the investigations, which concluded that there was no wrongdoing on the officers' part. However, after the local opposing political party launched its own inquiries, new evidence and witness testimonies surfaced which uncovered gross negligence and murder on the officers' part, as well as the possibility of a local and federal cover-up. Trials were held and a total of 10 officers were convicted of various crimes.|$|E
5|$|Other {{inquiries}} obtained similar {{testimony from}} witnesses, including {{the taxi driver}} who now stated that the activists were “alive and disarmed” when the police removed him from the scene. The taxi driver stated {{that there was a}} short exchange of gunfire, and when he was removed to another place nearby he heard a second volley of gunfire, but was asked by the police and investigators of the PR <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>to</b> forget about the second round of shots. The statement regarding two different volleys of shots was upheld by various people, including ex-officer Jesus Quiñones before a Federal grand jury (he quit the force shortly after the shootings), and three other civilian witnesses in a San Juan Star interview.|$|E

25|$|In July 2009, Smith {{requested}} {{a meeting with}} the head of the Justice Department's Voting Rights Section in order to discuss whether political appointees had been involved in the decision to narrow the case, stating that news reports contradicted the Justice Department's earlier claim that political appointees had not been involved, and that earlier congressional inquiries about this had been unsuccessful. Smith and Wolf also requested that the voter intimidation charges which had been previously been dropped be refiled. In January 2010, after several unsuccessful attempts at obtaining the requested information from the department, Wolf sought a resolution of inquiry that would have forced the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>to</b> provide Congress with the details of why it narrowed the case. In a vote along party lines, the resolution was defeated 15-14.|$|E
25|$|The {{suit was}} {{originally}} filed in U.S. District Court in Oregon (because {{that was where}} Reagan was living at the time), and that court ended up dismissing the action. Eitel appealed to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which, in 1997, reinstated the case and allowed the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>to</b> join Eitel as a plaintiff in the suit. At this time, the case was also transferred to District Court in Arizona. Eitel and the Justice Department, however, disagreed over the allegations of CIA involvement, and whether {{that should be a}} factor in the suit. The DoJ filed motions in 1998 to drop several of the defendants, provoking a sharp disagreement between Eitel and the Department, and resulting in Eitel's accusation that the DoJ was covering up covert activities and evidence.|$|E

25|$|A lengthy {{antitrust}} investigation followed. The United States Senate {{asked the}} Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>to</b> investigate the merger {{the day after}} it was announced, which the FTC did on May 14. As the merger {{was approved by the}} two companies in mid-May, the Senate and FTC each conducted separate investigations. On June 5, 1922, the FTC issued a report concluding that the merger was in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. However, United States Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty overruled the FTC on June 22. The merger finally took effect on October 10, 1922. Six decades later, financial analysts observed that Bethlehem Steel probably purchased Lackawanna Steel for less than half what the company was worth. Over the next decade, Bethlehem Steel spent more than $40 million modernizing the Lackawanna site.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, DeMarco {{is trying}} to cope with {{adjusting}} to civilian life. Although Dredd is uninterested in her romantically, he retains an interest in her welfare, and he helps her to find a job as a licensed private detective. Her first assignment appears to be a missing person case, but it actually transpires that her client is working for the Frendz Mob, and is using her to locate a man who they wish to kill. DeMarco manages to find their intended victim and save his life, and she calls Dredd to interrogate him. The man reports that he works in a warehouse in which the Judges' new Lawgiver handguns are kept before being shipped to the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>to</b> replace the old models. He has been bribed to allow the Frendz Mob to exchange the microchips in the weapons with new ones, but does not know why.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{invited the}} author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and {{civilian}} at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so {{for the safety of the}} nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put in a drawer and “never... see the light of day again.” The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the <b>Justice</b> <b>Department</b> <b>to</b> review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis.|$|E
