Barbossa and his crew suffer a curse from Aztec gold that makes them a team of living-dead. Verbinski {{approached}} Rush {{for the role of}} Barbossa, as he knew he could <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> subtle complexities of the character while still portraying a simple villainy that would suit the story's tone.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the series, Marceline the Vampire Queen is a thousand-year-old vampire. The Ice King is a {{recurring}} antagonist of the series, and frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo; although he is often at odds with Finn and Jake, he is generally not a serious threat. He was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who discovered a magic crown that gives him magical ice powers but eroded his memory and made him go insane. In addition, throughout the series, various character and events <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mysterious Mushroom War, a cataclysmic war that destroyed modern human society.|$|E
5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> relationships between the masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E

5|$|The known fossil {{material}} of Limusaurus consists of large assemblages of individuals mired in mud pits. These pits range in depth from , and were likely created by soil liquefaction from {{the footsteps of}} sauropods or other large dinosaurs. The size of these assemblages {{can be attributed to}} the tendency of smaller animals to become trapped in the mud (other animals that were trapped by these deposits include individuals of Guanlong, along with small ornithischians, crocodyliforms, turtles, mammals, and tritylodontid cynodonts), and may also <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> possible gregarious (group-living) tendencies of Limusaurus.|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude further away from the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
5|$|Krøyer's {{paintings}} of Marie between 1888 and 1906 present {{a record of}} the years they spent together. They show some of their most enjoyable times but also <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> marital tension that increased as time went by. Among the most notable {{paintings of}} her are Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore (1892), one of Denmark's most popular works, which shows Marie on the beach with their dog and with the moonlight reflected in the sea, Roses (1893), which depicts her relaxing in the garden, and Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife (1899). Also of note are the depictions of Marie on holiday in Ravello on the Amalfi Coast of Italy in 1890; the portrait for the frieze in the dining room at Skagen's Brøndums Hotel; Chez Moi, a series of watercolours of Marie and the couple's daughter Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen; and Midsummer Eve Bonfire on Skagen Beach, his last painting of her in which she is shown captured in the firelight with Alfvén.|$|E

5|$|The author {{noted that}} the {{character}} of Lavi was popular with fans, placing third in a poll (behind Allen and Kanda) despite infrequent appearances in later story arcs, and she promised that Lavi would return. The story arc involving Alma Karma, featuring several characters, was difficult for the author; as a result, the next arc in which Allen leaves the Black Order contained fewer characters per chapter due to its different format. The character of Apocryphos was introduced to <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Heart, a plot element briefly described in a past storyline which would later reappear. Due to Jump Square (the manga's magazine at the time) readership—older men, rather than children—Hoshino found Allen the most difficult character to write. She does not want Allen's problems in recent story arcs to lead to portraying him as a troubled teenager, preferring to show him as a cheerful person with a balance of strength and sorrow. After D.Gray-man dark narrative, Hoshino plans to write more lighthearted series in the future.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Vortigaunts {{were planned}} to begin Half-Life as enemy non-player characters, which the player {{has to win}} over as allies and lead in rebellion. This idea, however, proved {{impractical}} and was abandoned in favor of keeping the Vortigaunts as adversaries. The plan re-emerged for Half-Life 2, in which the species are active allies of the player. The Vortigaunts in Half-Life 2 were originally going to be fully integrated in City 17 alongside the humans under Combine rule. This did not reach fruition; due to the focus on developing the city combat, the resources to accomplish this were not available. As there were so few resulting Vortigaunts in the city, the developers instead decided to involve the Vortigaunts far more substantially in the sections of the game {{taking place in the}} countryside surrounding the city. The few Vortigaunts placed inside the city were used to <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> story arc for the Vortigaunts later in the game. Midway through Half-Life 2, the player witnesses a scene with a deceased Vortigaunt in a prison. Originally, the developers were intending to feature this Vortigaunt as an ally character who, if players rescue him, would fight enemy characters alongside the player. The developers liked this idea, {{but it was too late}} in the development to attempt this; instead, the idea was preserved for use in Episode Two. The concept was later showcased in an Episode Two trailer shown at the Games Convention in 2006.|$|E

25|$|Also in 1974, the Reg Grundy Organisation created {{its first}} soap opera, and {{significantly}} Australia's first teen soap opera, Class of '74.

25|$|The {{approximately}} fortnightly {{tidal cycle}} has large effects on intertidal and marine organisms. Hence their biological rhythms tend {{to occur in}} rough multiples of this period. Many other animals such as the vertebrates, display similar rhythms. Examples include gestation and egg hatching. In humans, the menstrual cycle lasts roughly a lunar month, an even multiple of the tidal period. Such parallels at least <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> common descent of all animals from a marine ancestor.|$|E
25|$|When {{the human}} genome was {{compared}} to the genomes of five comparison primate species, including the chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, gibbon, and macaque, {{it was found that}} there are approximately 20,000 human-specific insertions believed to be regulatory. While most insertions appear to be fitness neutral, a small amount have been identified in positively selected genes showing associations to neural phenotypes and some relating to dental and sensory perception-related phenotypes. These findings <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> seemingly important role of human-specific insertions in the recent evolution of humans.|$|E
25|$|Dimitris Lyacos in {{the second}} book of the Poena Damni trilogy With the People from the Bridge, a contemporary, avant-garde play {{focusing}} on {{the return of the}} dead and the myth of the revenant combines elements from the Eleusinian mysteries as well as early Christian tradition in order to convey a view of collective salvation.

25|$|The current trend {{appears to}} be that DNA barcoding needs to be used {{alongside}} traditional taxonomic tools and alternative forms of molecular systematics so that problem cases can be identified and errors detected. Non-cryptic species can generally be resolved by either traditional or molecular taxonomy without ambiguity. However, more difficult cases will only yield {{to a combination of}} approaches. And finally, as most of the global biodiversity remains unknown, molecular barcoding can only <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> existence of new taxa, but not delimit or describe them (DeSalle, 2006; Rubinoff, 2006).|$|E
25|$|Indeed, the Viking army did {{withdraw}} from Reading {{in the autumn}} of 871 to take up winter quarters in Mercian London. Although not mentioned by Asser, or by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Alfred probably also paid the Vikings cash to leave, much as the Mercians were to do in the following year. Hoards dating to the Viking occupation of London in 871/2 have been excavated at Croydon, Gravesend, and Waterloo Bridge. These finds <b>hint</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> cost involved in making peace with the Vikings. For the next five years the Danes occupied other parts of England.|$|E
