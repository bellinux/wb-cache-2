5|$|A second auction was held, with {{bids for}} natural gas given equal weight to those wishing to {{transfer}} crude oil, although any natural gas bidder would be obliged to maintain the oil pumping stations {{for use in a}} national emergency. Ten bids were received and on February 8, 1947, the Texas East Transmission Corporation (TETCO) was declared successful. <b>Its</b> <b>bid</b> of $143,127,000 would make the disposal the largest sale of war-surplus property to the private sector following World War II.|$|E
5|$|Beijing won <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> to {{host the}} 2008 Olympics on 13 July 2001. The first new venues to begin {{construction}} were the Beijing National Stadium, Beijing National Aquatics Center, Beijing Shooting Range Hall, and the Laoshan Velodrome, where major work commenced in December 2003. By May 2007, construction had begun {{at all of the}} Beijing venues for the games. Approximately RMB¥13 billion (US$1.9 billion) was spent to build and renovate the venues.|$|E
5|$|Human rights {{concerns}} {{expressed by}} Amnesty International and politicians in both Europe and the United States were {{considered by the}} delegates, according to IOC Executive Director François Carrard. Carrard and others suggested that the selection might lead to improvements in human rights in China. In addition, a number of IOC delegates who had formerly been athletes expressed concern about heat and air quality during the Games, considering {{the high levels of}} air pollution in Beijing. China outlined plans to address these environmental concerns in <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> application.|$|E

5|$|Lillehammer {{failed at}} <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> {{to host the}} 2012 Winter Youth Olympics, losing to Innsbruck, Austria, but was awarded the 2016 edition as the only bidder. The bid was based on reuse of the {{heritage}} and venues from the 1994 Olympics. Beyond {{the construction of an}} Olympic Village, the only major upgrade to the venues is the addition of a curling rink in Kristins Hall.|$|E
5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture. Two legal challenges to the parent company were filed by investors, one in Pillsbury's home state of Minnesota and another in the state where it was incorporated, Delaware, in which the legality of the stock tender plan was questioned. These three events eventually forced Pillsbury to give up <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> to fend off Grand Metropolitan and agree to be acquired in November 1988 for a sum of US$5.7 billion.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{succeeded in}} <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> {{to join the}} United States in 1845 which helped launch the Mexican-American War. Texas' {{annexation}} brought more people to Texas and ranching interests around the bay began to grow. Throughout the 19th century Galveston remained Texas' dominant metropolis and the communities around the bay were strongly tied economically and culturally to the city though, as Houston began to develop, so did the Bay Area's ties to it. The construction of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson Railroad further spurred growth in the area.|$|E

5|$|Texas {{succeeded in}} <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> {{to join the}} United States in 1845, {{one of the key}} causes of the {{subsequent}} Mexican-American War. Texas' annexation brought more people to Texas. Ranching interests expanded around the bay, along with the growth of the farming and lumber enterprises in the region. The construction of the Galveston, Houston and Henderson (GH) Railroad, begun in 1857, further spurred more growth in the region.|$|E
5|$|United {{dominated}} English {{football in}} the 1993–94 season, winning a second consecutive Premier League title and then defeating Chelsea in the FA Cup final to become only the fourth team, and Bruce the first English captain, to win The Double in the 20th century, The 1994–95 season was a disappointing one for Bruce and United, as the club failed in <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> {{to win a}} third consecutive Premier League title and lost to Everton in the FA Cup final.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} for the inaugural edition of the San Francisco Bowl (now the Fight Hunger Bowl) after a 9–4 record during the 2002 college football season. Tech defeated several nationally ranked teams, including No. 14 LSU and No. 19 Texas A. Tech's opponent, Air Force, received <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> following an 8–4 regular season. Air Force faced several BCS-conference opponents during the regular season, including California and Northwestern.|$|E

5|$|During {{the process}} of the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics, the International Olympic Committee had not {{specified}} that it was necessary with an indoor speed skating rink. Calgary had used the indoor Olympic Oval during the 1988 Winter Olympics, but Albertville, who were awarded the 1992 Winter Olympics, had opted for the outdoor L'anneau de vitesse. In <b>its</b> <b>bid,</b> the speed skating events were planned held at Stampesletta, an outdoor track and field stadium in Lillehammer. Only after Lillehammer had been awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics was it decided that an indoor venue would have to be built for the games.|$|E
5|$|Florida State earned <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> to the ACC Championship game by {{fighting}} through an Atlantic Division schedule that included several nationally ranked teams. After defeating ninth-ranked Miami in their opening contest, the Seminoles won their next four games before losing at Virginia {{in a close}} match. Additional losses to North Carolina State and Clemson {{at the end of}} the season almost eliminated the Seminoles from contention for a spot in the championship game, but losses by Clemson and the other Atlantic Division leaders gave the Seminoles a second chance and set up an ACC Championship game between Florida State and Virginia Tech. The two teams had previously played in the 2000 National Championship Game, and the rematch served as a point of public interest.|$|E
5|$|Nine cities {{submitting}} bids to {{host the}} 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics were recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The Committee shortlisted five of them—London, Madrid, Moscow, New York City, and Paris—from which London eventually prevailed; thus becoming the first city {{to host the}} Olympic Games for a third time. The bidding process for the 2012 Olympics {{was considered one of}} the most hotly contested in the history of the IOC. Paris was seen by some as the front-runner for much of the campaign, but skillful lobbying by London's supporters and an inspirational final presentation by Sebastian Coe led to the success of <b>its</b> <b>bid.</b>|$|E

5|$|Prior to the Lillehammer Olympics, {{there was}} no {{bobsleigh}} and luge track in Norway. During the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo, Korketrekkeren had been built as a temporary venue, but {{it was made of}} snow and was not reused after the Olympics. In <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> for the 1994 Winter Olympics, Lillehammer had proposed placing the bobsleigh and luge track next to Balbergbakken in Fåberg. By May 1989, plans for most of the venues were being reshuffled and the track was then proposed located at Kanthaugen as part of an Olympic Park at Stampesletta. The Kanthaugen proposal was estimated to cost NOK231 million.|$|E
5|$|With {{the clear}} {{goal of a}} manned landing {{replacing}} the more nebulous goals of space stations and cislunar flights, NASA had to hit the ground running, and decided to discard the feasibility study designs of Convair, GE, and Martin, and proceed with Faget's command / service module design. The mission module {{was determined to be}} only useful as an extra room, and therefore deemed unnecessary. They used Faget's design as the specification for another competition for spacecraft procurement bids in October 1961. On November 28, 1961, it was announced that North American Aviation had won the contract, although <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> was not rated as good as Martin's. Webb, Dryden and Robert Seamans chose it in preference due to North American's longer association with NACA.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's initial {{proposal}} to rebuild Highbury {{was met with}} disapproval from local residents, as it required the demolition of 25 neighbouring houses. It later became problematic once the East Stand of the stadium was granted Grade II listing in July 1997. After much consultation, the club abandoned its plan, deciding a capacity of 48,000 was not large enough. Arsenal then investigated the possibility of relocating to Wembley Stadium and in March 1998 made an official bid to purchase the ground. The Football Association (FA) and the English National Stadium Trust opposed Arsenal's offer, claiming it harmed England's bid for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, which FIFA itself denied. In April 1998, Arsenal withdrew <b>its</b> <b>bid</b> and Wembley was purchased by the English National Stadium Trust. The club however was given permission to host its UEFA Champions League home ties at Wembley for the 1998–99 and 1999–2000 seasons. Although Arsenal's time in the competition was brief, twice exiting the group stages, the club set its record home attendance (73,707 against Lens) and earned record gate income in the 1998–99 season, highlighting potential profitability.|$|E
