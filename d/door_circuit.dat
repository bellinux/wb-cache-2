50|$|More {{sophisticated}} aftermarket alarms are wired {{into the}} vehicle's electronics individually. Typically, these alarms have inputs {{for power and}} ground, {{as well as for}} positive- and negative-switched <b>door</b> open <b>circuits,</b> negative trunk and/or hood circuits, and ignition-switched circuits to detect the ignition being turned on; aftermarket alarms also usually have a shock sensor which may be built into the control module or external to it.|$|R
50|$|As built, {{the sliding}} doors were opened by the passengers. Once {{the driver had}} stopped the train and the guard had {{activated}} the master door release, a passenger could move the door handle gently sideways which operated a switch controlling the individual <b>door</b> opening <b>circuit.</b> Many people did not wait for the guard's release and gave the handle a much harder tug, which could open the door even if the train had not stopped. Concerns over passenger safety led to the handles being replaced by push-buttons from March 1977.|$|R
50|$|On a gate stock train, each of {{the cars}} had its own conductor, who was {{responsible}} for the operation of the doors on that car. It was originally planned to work the air operated doors in a similar fashion, but the method adopted was for all the doors on a 3-car train to be controlled by a guard {{at the rear of the}} motor car. This reduced the number of staff needed to operate a 6-car train from seven to three, consisting of a driver, a rear guard and a front guard. Each guard controlled the doors on the three cars at his end of the train. The cars were initially fitted with yellow flipper arms, which protruded from the side of the vehicle when a door was open, and enabled staff to identify doors which had not yet closed. The design was unsatisfactory, and the arms were replaced by indicator lamps interlocked to the air engines in 1924. Traction control <b>circuits</b> and <b>door</b> operating <b>circuits</b> were carried along the train by 10-core jumpers fitted at roof height between the cars. There were two lighting circuits, one fed from {{each of the}} motor cars. It was possible to operate a 3-car train, but in order to do so, a shorting plug had to be fitted to the control trailer, to connect the lighting circuits, and to complete the <b>door</b> interlock <b>circuit.</b>|$|R
25|$|Hopper's crew have {{repaired}} the ship, and the Doctor rewires {{the controls}} {{to the station}} so they are inactive. He then sets up a circuit to electrify the doors again, along with the control panels and the hatch. The Controller, still alive, advances towards them. Everyone tries to shut the outer doors using insulating poles, but the Controller is too strong. Toberman closes the <b>doors,</b> completing the <b>circuit,</b> and both he and the Controller are electrocuted.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, Hickory Hollow {{would lose}} {{three of its}} largest tenants. Dillard's began liquidating its {{inventory}} in May and closed on August 2, initiating the mass exodus of smaller stores. That same year, big box retailer Linens ‘n Things closed all national stores to exclusively operate online while Steve & Barry's announced their bankruptcy on November 20, 2008 and closed in early 2009. By that time, large stores outside the mall had also closed their <b>doors</b> including <b>Circuit</b> City, closing all locations nationally, Toys [...] "R" [...] Us, Pier 1 Imports, Michaels, and Office Depot. At the conclusion of 2009 store occupancy had fallen below 70%, Outback Steakhouse had departed the premises, and Hickory Hollow was ranked by U.S. News & World Report as one of America's 10 most endangered malls. Sales dropped to $187 per square foot of retail space, under 45% of {{the national average of}} $420, and the value of the mall was severely downgraded to $12.6 million.|$|R

40|$|Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is {{a method}} for characterizing and {{monitoring}} discrete loads connected to a power distribution system. This can include a ship, a car, or a utility distribution system. The entire concept is predicated on having access to digital samples of the current and voltage signals at the distribution point. This thesis presents a {{analog to digital converter}} for this task and a new low-power inductive current sensor for deployment in a standard circuit breaker box.

40|$|In several {{mechanical}} engineering applications high spatial resolution measurements are required. Adapted optical measurement instruments {{such as the}} laser scanning Doppler vibrometer (SLDV) and the electronic speckle pattern interferometer (ESPI) exist to perform this task. The result of this high spatial resolution measurement is that {{a large amount of}} data is available which has to be processed. In addition, care should be taken when processing the measurements, because locations with poor measurement quality typically exist. In this article a method will be developed {{to reduce the amount of}} measurements so that further processing is less time consuming. In addition, as a side effect of the data reduction method, poor quality measurements will be filtered and the overall SNR will improve. The method uses an iterative robust two-step spline approximation with an automatic model order determination procedure. The validation of the technique is performed both on scanning laser vibrometer measurements of a car <b>door</b> and a <b>circuit</b> board and on ESPI data. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Security is {{the prime}} concern in our day to day life while {{performing}} any activity. In the current scenario, accidental death of lineman is often read and evidenced. In this direction, a safety measure to safe guard the operator is found very necessary looking into the present working style. The electric lineman safety system is designed to control the control panel <b>doors</b> and <b>circuit</b> breaker by using a password for the safety. Critical electrical accidents to lineman {{are on the rise}} during electric line repair may be due to lack of communication and co-ordination between the maintenance staff and electric substation staff. The proposed system provides a solution that ensures safety of lineman. The control to turn ON or OFF the line is maintained by the lineman. The system has an arrangement such that a password is required to operate the doors of the control panel and circuit breaker (ON/OFF). A secured password is requested and received from the control room by the lineman for the point of repair or service. This request is registered and a password is sent to the lineman’s mobile and control panel GSM module for the further work. The password is entered through the matrix keypad which is interfaced to the Arduino Uno microcontroller. The entered password is compared with the password received by the control panel GSM receiver. If the entered password is correct then the circuit breaker ON/OFF and door OPEN/CLOSE feature is enabled for the lineman to take up repair. Any intruder tries to operate the mechanism with the wrong password by three times it will display a message in the LCD display and a message is sent to the control room regarding unauthorized accessing of the system for the safety reasons...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand on railway transportation due to social, economic and demographic factors has triggered an evolution in preventive maintenance strategies towards more optimized and cost-effective processes. Within this context {{related to the}} increasing interest in predictive maintenance strategies, commercial trains are being equipped with both positioning and communication systems as well as onboard intelligent sensors monitoring various subsystems all over the train, thus providing real-time flow of information that is transferred to centralized data servers via wireless technology. This information consists of georeferenced alarms, called events, along with their spatial and temporal coordinates. Alstom Transport has concieved TrainTracer TM, a state-of-the-art software which allows to collect and process real-time data sent by fleets of commercial trains equipped with onboard sensors monitoring various subsystems such as the auxiliary converter, <b>doors,</b> brakes, power <b>circuit</b> and tilt systems. This data consists of series of timestamped events where each event is identified by a numerical code in addition to context variables describing the physical, geographical and technical framework of the train at its exact time of occurrence. This paper aims to investigate how a data mining approach {{can be applied to}} discover significant co-occurrences between pairs of events. Once identified and scrutinized by various metrics, these co-occurrences are then used to derive temporal association rules {{that can be used to}} perform an on-line analysis of the incoming event stream in order to predict and alert the imminent occurrence of severe failure events, i. e., failures requiring immediate corrective maintenance actions, also called target events. The proposed methodology is based on different randomization null models applied on temporal data sequences...|$|R
40|$|Congress {{created the}} United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in 1982, and granted that court {{exclusive}} appellate jurisdiction over civil actions arising under patent law. Congress 2 ̆ 7 s primary goals {{in creating the}} Federal Circuit were to produce a more uniform patent jurisprudence and to reduce forum shopping based on favorable patent law. But in the 2002 decision of Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, the Supreme Court held that patent counterclaims alone could not create Federal Circuit jurisdiction. This decision not only overruled the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s longstanding jurisdictional rule, but also opened the <b>door</b> for Regional <b>Circuit</b> Courts of Appeals (RCCOAs) to decide appeals where patent claims appear only as counterclaims. Because RCCOAs generally do not defer to the decisions of coordinate federal courts (what can be termed the rule of no deference), RCCOAs {{will be able to}} independently develop patent caselaw - threatening the goals for which the Federal Circuit was created. To date, the scholarly response to Vornado 2 ̆ 7 s problems has focused on approaches expanding the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s jurisdiction. Commentators addressing deference to the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s patent precedents have either assumed that deference is impossible or impractical, or have mentioned deference as an option only in passing. No one yet has analyzed in detail the case for deference to the Federal Circuit. This article provides that analysis. It explains why the traditional justifications for the rule of no deference are inapplicable here, why deference to the Federal Circuit serves Congressional intent, and why the reasons for such deference compare favorably to established exceptions to the rule of no deference. The article also suggests a particular scope and level of deference, and explains deference 2 ̆ 7 s superiority as a long-term solution over jurisdictional modifications. The article should be particularly useful to practitioners and judges faced with these issues in the short-term, and should facilitate inquiry by legislators and academics into a long-term resolution...|$|R
