40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{submitted}} as {{a portfolio of}} peer-reviewed publications. For many geochemical systems, reaction kinetics determines the system's current status and evolution. It might also {{be the key to}} unraveling their thermal history. In metal sulfide systems, kinetic studies have been carried out on four sets of solid-state transitions/transformations in Fe-Ni-S and Ni-S systems. In this work, a new kinetic model, the Refined Avrami method, has been developed to account for reactions involving changes in reaction mechanisms. Nonstoichiometric compounds are commonly present in these reactions. The exsolution of pentladite from the monosulfide solid solution (mss) is an important reaction in the formation of nickel ores. For near equimolar mss compositions, the reaction rate is rapid even in the low temperature ranges. For bulk composition Fe₀. ₇₇ Ni₀. ₁₉ S, the experimental results show the reaction rates (mss → pentlandite) vary from 1. 6 x 10 ⁻⁵ to 5. 0 x 10 ⁻⁷ s⁻¹ at 200 °C and from 9. 4 x 10 ⁻⁵ to 4. 1 x 10 ⁻⁷ s⁻¹ at 300 °C. The activation energy, E [subscript a], varies during the course of reaction from 49. 6 kJ. mol⁻¹ at the beginning of reaction (nucleation mechanism is dominant) to 20. 7 kJ. mol⁻¹ at the end (crystal growth mechanism is dominant). Monosulfide solid solution (mss) is a common intermediate phase observed during the oxidation of nickel ores, such as violarite and pentlandite. The investigation of mss oxidation is of benefit in understanding the thermal behavior of economically important metal sulfides during smelting. The oxidation products of mss vary in our samples depending on their compositions. Apart from the common oxidation products hematite and Ni₁ ₇ S₁₈, Fe₂ (SO₄) ₃ was observed during the oxidation of Fe₇. ₉ S₈ and pentlandite for Fe₆. ₁ ₅Ni₁. ₅₄ S₈. The activation energy was determined using a model-free method. The oxidation of Fe₆. ₄ Ni₁. ₆ S₈ exhibited a higher E [subscript a] than Fe₆. ₁ ₅Ni₁. ₅₄ S₈ {{over the course of the}} reaction. The E [subscript a] increases with reaction extent (y) from 67. 1 to 103. 3 kJ. mol⁻¹ for mss composition Fe₆. ₁ ₅Ni₁. ₅₄ S₈ and from 76. 1 to 195. 0 kJ. mol⁻¹ for Fe₆. ₄ Ni₁. ₆ S₈. The kinetic study of the α - Ni₁₋ ₓ S → β - NiS transition shows that initial compositions of α - Ni₁₋ ₓ S plays an important role in the kinetics of the transition. The activation energy (E [subscript a]) for this α - to β - phase transition is 16. 0 (± 0. 5) kJ. mol⁻¹ for NiS in the temperature range 70 to 150 °C, and 13. 0 (± 0. 5) kJ. mol⁻¹ in the temperature range 250 to 350 °C. For Ni₀. ₉₇ S, however, E [subscript a] deceases from 73. 0 (± 0. 5) to 17. 0 (± 0. 5) kJ. mol⁻¹ over the course of the reaction in the temperature range 300 to 320 °C. The relationship between E [subscript a] and extent of transition (y) for the initial bulk Ni₀. ₉₇ S was derived using the Refined Avrami method. For Ni deficient compositions, α - Ni₁₋ₓ S, the transformation to β-NiS is accompanied by the exsolution of either a progressively more Ni deficient α-Ni₁₋ₓ S and Ni₃ S₄, and the reactions become more sluggish for more metal deficient compositions. The study of oxidation kinetics of α-NiS is of metallurgical interest, as α-NiS related phases may occur when nickel ores are <b>flash</b> <b>smelted</b> to produce nickel matte. In an open air environment, the oxidation mechanisms of α-NiS are constant at 670 and 680 °C, dominated by the direct oxidation of α-NiS → NiO. The dominant oxidation mechanism changes to a chain reaction : α-NiS → [superscript k] ₁ Ni₃ S₂ → [superscript k] ₂ NiO at 700 °C. Therefore, different kinetic models need to be applied to these two distinct reaction mechanisms. Activation energy for the oxidation, α-NiS → NiO, in the temperature range 670 to 680 °C was calculated to be 868. 2 kJ. mol⁻¹ using Avrami/Arrhenius method. Rate constant k₁ and k₂ are approximated to be 3 x 10 ⁻⁴ s⁻¹ and 5 x 10 ⁻⁴ s⁻¹ for the first part and second part of the chain reaction respectively at 700 ° C. The study of the variation in reaction rate with oxidation time illustrates the optimum oxidation time zone for each temperature, where NiO can be produced at the fastest rate. Thesis (Ph. D.)

At that time, the blast furnaces, the reverberatory furnaces and the electric furnaces with a small capacity, that were mainly located nearby the copper mines inland, were used for copper smelting. In the 1960 ’s to 1970 ’s the smelters increased their production to balance the rapid increase of domestic demand {{in the use of}} the imported copper concentrate because the price of domestic concentrate, that was exploited from the deeper face and processed from the lower grade ore than before, became much more expensive than the concentrate from abroad. In 1965 the coastal smelter and refinery complex was built by Onahama Smelting and Refining Co. Ltd. to gain an advantage over treatment of the imported concentrate. This smelter was equipped with two reverberatory furnaces that were the one of the largest reverberatory furnace in the world at that time and its original capacity was 72, 000 tonnes of copper/year. And then, from 1967 to 1973, the rush of constructing the coastal smelter and refinery complexes that adopted the Outokumpu <b>flash</b> furnaces as <b>smelting</b> furnace and the shut down of the conventional furnaces occurred in Japan. And then, commercial operation of Mitsubishi’s continuous furnace started in 1973. On the other hand, in 1970 ’s the energy crises shook the world twice. In Japan, the oil price and the electricity price soared 10 -folds and 4 -folds, respectively. In order to break through these tougher conditions, Japanese Copper industry tried to reduce the energy cost and to increase production, and survived successfully.

50|$|As of 2005, {{roasting}} is {{no longer}} common in copper concentrate treatment, because its combination with reverberatory furnaces is not energy efficient and the SO2 concentration in the roaster offgas is too dilute for cost-effective capture.

50|$|The Sherritt {{process is}} a hydrometallurgical process named for Sherritt Gordon Mines Ltd. (now Sherritt International) of Sherridon and Lynn Lake Manitoba Canada, based on the older Forward process {{developed}} by Dr. Frank Forward for the recovery of copper and nickel from those same mines. Nickel sulfide concentrates can be treated by either roasting or <b>flash</b> <b>smelting</b> to produce matte from which nickel and cobalt can be recovered hydrometallurgically, {{or they may be}} treated by an ammonia solution pressure leach. The residue is removed. A feed of matte and sulfide concentrate containing approximately 0.4% cobalt and 30% sulfur is pressure leached at elevated temperature and pressure in an ammoniacal solution to produce a solution of nickel, copper and cobalt. By boiling away the ammonia; copper is precipitated as a sulfide and sent to a smelter. Hydrogen sulfide is added to the autoclave to remove nickel sulfide and copper sulfide which is fed back to the leaching process. Air is then passed through the solution in the autoclave for oxyhydrolysis. The solution is then reduced with hydrogen, again at high temperature and pressure, to precipitate nickel powder (>99%). The remaining solution (containing approximately equal proportions of nickel and cobalt sulfides), is then adjusted (to a lower temperature and pressure) to precipitate the mixed sulfides and the fluid is concentrated and crystallized into ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4). The mixed sulfides are pressure leached with air and sulfuric acid. Ammonia is then added to remove potassium and iron as jarosite (KFe (OH)6(SO4)2). More ammonia and air is added for oxidation. The solution is removed from the autoclave and sulfuric acid added to remove nickel as nickel(II) sulfate-ammonium sulfate hexahydrate ((NiSO4)•((NH4)2SO4)•6H2O) which is then sent to have its nickel recovered. The solution is then further reduced with more sulfuric acid and cobalt metal powder is added to aid in the nucleation of precipitants (seeding). Addition of hydrogen gas to saturation precipitates cobalt powder with a purity of approximately 99.6%.|$|E
