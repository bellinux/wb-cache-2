5|$|The 1999–2000 Devils {{focused more}} on offense, which was {{reinforced}} by their 251 goals scored, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for second in the league. With four players scoring over 50 points, including rookie Scott Gomez's team leading 51 assists, Stevens' 29 points were only <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for tenth on the team, and third among defencemen behind Niedermayer and Brian Rafalski. Stevens also set an NHL record, becoming {{the first player to}} play in 600 games with two teams. After finishing the season in fourth place in the conference, the Devils swept the Florida Panthers and defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs in six games.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's 83 record {{during the}} 1998 college {{football}} regular season was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> {{to earn it}} a bid to the inaugural Music City Bowl game. Facing the Hokies were the Alabama Crimson Tide, who had gone 74 during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|A Japanese raiding party {{destroyed}} the bridge over Tuliahan River; Chase's security was not <b>good</b> <b>enough.</b> This prevented {{the main body}} of the 1st Cavalry Division from linking up with Chase's force in Manila. Supplies were dispatched through the 37th Infantry Division's zone until engineers could build a new bridge. For his advance on Manila, Chase was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He was also awarded the Purple Heart for the burns to his hands.|$|E
60|$|The {{captain of}} the Belinda was very willing to make a {{profitable}} voyage back to Jamaica, but his vessel must be well laden before he could do this. <b>Goods</b> <b>enough</b> there were at Belize for that purpose, for Blackbeard's supplies were all for sale, and his chief clerk, Bonnet, had the selling of them. So, all parties being like-minded, the Belinda soon began to take on goods for Kingston.|$|R

5|$|After {{the rest}} day came the race's {{individual}} time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, {{who was more}} than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time was <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.|$|E
5|$|During {{the regular}} season, Clemson was No. 10 in rushing yards, {{averaging}} 236.4 per game. Its passing offense was somewhat weaker, ranked No. 63 and averaging 210.1 yards per game. In total, however, Clemson's offense ranked No. 10 {{when the two}} amounts were added together. In scoring offense, the Tigers averaged 36.0 points per game, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for No. 14 {{in the country in}} that category.|$|E
5|$|European {{dominance}} was at {{the forefront}} of United's agenda during the 1997–98 season. Having failed to take their chances in a semi-final against eventual champions Borussia Dortmund in 1996–97, Ferguson was resolute to go one step further and emulate Matt Busby's success of 1968, quashing any talk that his team was not <b>good</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|E

They also asked {{to speak to the}} cameraman, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently told them he did not speak French and that his English was not <b>good</b> <b>enough.</b>|$|E
5|$|Indiana's offense {{averaged}} 21.6points and 320total {{yards per}} game during the regular season, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for ninth in the Big Ten. As a whole, the Hoosiers accumulated 3,818yards of offense before the Independence Bowl. 2,156yards of this total were passing yards and came through the air, while the remaining 1,662yards were gained by Indiana's running backs and fullbacks on the ground.|$|E

5|$|On the ground, Texas' rushing {{offense was}} led by two running backs: Ricky Williams and Shon Mitchell. Together, they {{averaged}} 207 yards per game, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for No. 22 nationally. Mitchell started at running back and gained 1,099 rushing yards. Williams accumulated 990 rushing yards during the regular season. That figure was a record for Texas freshmen. Protecting Williams, Mitchell, and Brown was a successful offensive line led by All-America guard Dan Neil.|$|E
5|$|Opinions on the game's mid-level {{checkpoint}} {{system were}} mixed. Matt Cullen of Canadian Online Gaming {{noted that the}} checkpoints meant that players were not sent too far back into the level after each death, saving time. Official Xbox Magazine's Taylor Cocke, however, noted that the checkpoints save players' point progress, meaning that players would have to start the level over if their performance wasn't <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> before they reached the checkpoint.|$|E

40|$|S uccess in the {{business}} of producing agricultural commodities goes to those with the lowest production costs and highest volume, both of which are best achieved through specialization. The payoffs from getting big and specialized are not unique to farming. Frederick Taylor’s principles of scientific management {{in the early twentieth century}} accompanied vast changes in the way that goods were manufactured. Henry Ford’s new assembly plants dramatically increased labor productivity by having each worker become adept at a single task. The payoff from increased specialization and control over the work environment allowed both corporate profits and worker pay to increase while simultaneously dropping the price of manufactured <b>goods</b> <b>enough</b> so that most working families could buy them...|$|R

5|$|The Virginia Tech offense progressed {{during the}} course of the regular season. In the Hokies' first six games, they {{averaged}} just 13.4 points.

50|$|Negros Oriental's {{economy was}} far from progressive, and its rich soil was not {{utilized}} to its full capacity. That was in the 1850s. During those years, people in Negros depict a life of content for they tend to produce <b>goods</b> <b>enough</b> only to meet their daily needs. Even before the sugar boom of the 1850s, Negros Oriental was already producing sugar. The transport of most of its product was mainly done in the ports of Iloilo, which explains the fast moving pace of development of the sugar industry in Negros Occidental, primarily due to its proximity to Iloilo. This situation was a disadvantage on the movement of sugar from the Oriental plantations.|$|R

All five coaches were derailed and the last coach fouled the Up track, on which a goods train was due. The crew of the express acted to protect their train: the driver placed a detonator on one rail of the Up track and the guard sounded the train whistle, both of which gave the crew of the approaching Up <b>goods</b> <b>enough</b> warning to stop short of the wreckage.|$|R

Tech permitted {{an average of}} 99.3 yards per game on the ground (16th), but allowed 224.4 yards per game through the air (79th). In total, Tech was ranked the No. 27 defense in the country—slightly better than Clemson. In scoring defense, the Hokies allowed 22.6 points per game on average, <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> for No. 45. In this category, they were worse than the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Born in the Melbourne {{suburb of}} Preston on 8 January 1918, Kingsbury {{was the second}} son of Philip Blencowe Kingsbury, an estate agent, and his wife Florence Annie, née Steel.

Kingsbury {{attended}} Windsor State School as a child, and his results were <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> to earn a scholarship at Melbourne Technical College. Avery began an agricultural course in Longerenong. Although qualified as a printer, Kingsbury began working at his father's real estate business, a job he disliked.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1880s, their engines were {{becoming}} worn out {{and most of}} the ships were placed into reserve for a few years before being sold for breaking up. The machinery of Avon, Dwarf and Elk was in <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> shape that they were assigned as tenders to the coastguard district ships at Hull, Southampton, and Liverpool for a number of years. Midge was also an exception and was retained in Chinese waters until 1907 when she was sold at Hong Kong. Elk lasted nearly as long in harbour service as she was reclassified as a tugboat in 1890 and was then sold as a dredger in 1905.|$|E

60|$|Consider, then, {{how great}} {{must be the}} damage inflicted by undue mental {{excitement}} on children and youths. More or less of this constitutional disturbance will inevitably follow an exertion of brain beyond the normal amount; and when not so excessive as to produce absolute illness, is sure to entail a slowly accumulating degeneracy of physique.

The due performance of every vital process depends on an adequate supply of <b>good</b> blood. Without <b>enough</b> <b>good</b> blood, no gland can secrete properly, no viscus can fully discharge its office. Without <b>enough</b> <b>good</b> blood, no nerve, muscle, membrane, or other tissue can be efficiently repaired. Without <b>enough</b> <b>good</b> blood, growth will neither be sound nor sufficient.
