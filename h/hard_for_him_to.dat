5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was the equal of Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased {{to be able to}} support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Lowell {{is forced}} to leave Nantucket and enter the Witness Protection Program after {{witnessing}} a mob hit. Although it is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave the people he has known all his life, Lowell decides he would rather go into hiding than let a guilty man go free to possibly kill again.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2004, a {{tour was}} {{cancelled}} and {{the recording of}} a new studio album stopped when Green left the band and moved to Sweden. Shortly afterwards he joined The British Blues All Stars, for a tour scheduled for the next year. However, this tour was cancelled {{after the death of}} saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith. At the time, Green stated that the medication he was taking to treat his psychological problems was making it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> concentrate and sapped his desire to play guitar.|$|E
5000|$|... "Dear Lurene, Thank you {{for pulling}} me {{through so many}} broadcasts—fondly, Ronnie."—A note Tuttle {{received}} from actor Ronald Colman, who was fond of radio and accepted numerous radio jobs himself when film roles became <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> come by in his later years.|$|R
50|$|There are six screens of {{increasing}} difficulty, with more burgers and enemies, burgers {{that have more}} parts, and/or layouts that {{make it easier for}} Peter Pepper to be cornered and <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> reach the ingredients. Completing all six screens takes the player back to the first one.|$|R
50|$|Thorbjørn Sindballe {{weighs in}} at 80 kg and is 190 cm tall, {{which is an}} unusual size for an elite triathlete. His size makes him less aerodynamic, heavier for running, and makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> endure the heat, which is a strong factor in several {{important}} competitions.|$|R
25|$|Sunao is {{a second}} year student from class 2-A {{and the head of}} the drama club. Incidentally, she was Leo's classmate at junior high school. Sunao has a strong sense of justice. She hates Erika Kiriya who is self-righteous. At {{beginning}} of the story, she has a hatred for Leo, and she is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> deal with. Her story was added in the PS2 version. The Minikiss for PC contains her story added sexual content with her path on the PS2 version.|$|E
25|$|Qazi {{was tried}} by a Virginia state court jury {{over a period}} of ten days in November 1997, on a plea of not guilty to all charges. During the trial the defense {{introduced}} testimony from Dr. Richard Restak, a neurologist and also a neuropsychiatrist, that Kansi was missing tissue from his frontal lobes, a congenital defect that made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> judge the consequence of his actions. This testimony was re-iterated by another psychiatrist for the defense based upon independent examination. The jury found him guilty, and fixed punishment for the capital murder charge at death.|$|E
25|$|Ewan's {{possessions}} on {{the islands}} were held from the king of Norway, whilst his possessions on the mainland were held from the king of Scotland. This made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> remain loyal to both. In 1263 Haakon IV of Norway arrived with a huge fleet {{off the coast of}} Oban for an invasion of the west coast of Scotland. However Ewan decided not to join the invasion and thanks to old blood ties Haakon left him in peace. The Battle of Largs then took place and Ewan joined the side of Scots and attacked part of the Norse fleet. The Vikings were utterly defeated and three years later Norway ceded all of the Hebrides to Scotland.|$|E
5000|$|The old, {{experienced}} Policemen (Chief Policemen): Only seen {{during the}} second act, when he interrogates the group. He cleverly causes every member to reveal something they did not intend to. He has a son {{about the age of}} Tarzan, which makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> send Tarzan to jail.|$|R
60|$|So {{spoke the}} gentle old priest, who looked from his {{peaceful}} haven with dreamy eyes upon the sweat and tussle of the world's battle. Had he instead {{been in the}} thick of the fight, it might have been <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> believe that his enemies ever had right upon their side.|$|R
50|$|It's {{all part}} of the New Journalism, or the Now Journalism, and it's practiced widely these days. Some editors and reporters vigorously defend it. Others just as vigorously attack it. No one has polled the reader, but whether he approves or disapproves, it's getting <b>harder</b> and <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> know what he can believe.|$|R
25|$|At a party, Zoe meets {{fraternity}} president Kyle Spencer (Evan Peters), {{who takes}} a liking to her. Madison is gang-raped by Kyle's frat brothers and, as revenge, uses her power to flip their bus, killing Kyle and six others. Two of the boys survive and are placed in critical care. Zoe goes {{to the hospital and}} kills the remaining rapist with her power. To repay Zoe, Madison revives a dismembered Kyle by attaching his frat brothers' severed limbs to his head and casting a resurrection spell, but he returns frightened and simple-minded. It is revealed that Kyle's mother sexually abused him, making it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> be trusting of physical touch. His revived corpse attracts Misty Day (Lily Rabe), a witch who resurrected herself after being burned at the stake.|$|E
25|$|Dave Bartlett and Vanessa Hunt, the two paramedics {{who were}} called {{to the scene of}} Kelly's death, have since gone public with their opinion that there was not enough blood at the {{location}} to justify the belief that he had died from blood loss. Bartlett and Hunt told The Guardian that they had seen a small amount of blood on plants near Kelly's body and a patch of blood the size of a coin on his trousers. They said they would expect to find several pints of blood at the scene of a suicide involving an arterial cut. Two forensic pathologists, Chris Milroy of Sheffield University and Guy Rutty of Leicester University, dismissed the paramedics' claims, saying it is hard to judge blood loss from the scene of a death, as some blood may have seeped into the ground. Milroy also told The Guardian that Kelly's heart condition may have made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> sustain any significant degree of blood loss.|$|E
25|$|The {{advent of}} the First World War brought a time of {{hardship}} for Burnet's practice, and during this period a disagreement resulted in Tait leaving the practice to work in America. After the war, the London office began to receive commissions once more, including work on completing the Selfridges department store on Oxford Street. The Imperial War Graves Commission also commissioned war memorials from Burnet's firm in Gallipoli, Palestine and Suez (1919). Burnet took {{a leading role in}} the design of the memorials and in the work on Adelaide House, London Bridge. His health was deteriorating, however; stress-related eczema, brought on by wartime hardship, professional disagreements and financial scandals in the Glasgow office, made it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> work. Thomas Tait had returned to the practice after a reconciliation, and he began to take {{a leading role in the}} practice, working on the Daily Telegraph Building and Lloyds Bank on Cornhill. Burnet himself dealt with the redesign on Lomax Simpson's Unilever House project, but otherwise acted as a consultant and went into semi-retirement.|$|E
50|$|Eventually, Chespirito's age {{began to}} catch up with him and it became <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> {{adequately}} portray some of his characters, especially El Chavo and El Chapulin Colorado. In 1992, at the age of sixty-three, Chespirito retired the El Chavo character from his show (he did the same thing to El Chapulin Colorado one year later).|$|R
50|$|Melton led {{the league}} in walks and wild pitches during the 1942 season. Due to his arm injury from World War 2, this made it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> play ball. He was forced to make his career short but will {{certainly}} not be forgotten. Melton died in an automobile accident in Greer, South Carolina in 1971.|$|R
50|$|Kurata {{is a man}} {{who refuses}} to leave the frontlines of the war against the BOOMERS. He has had many chances for {{promotion}} but has always refused the jobs that would take him away from the action. He cares for his crew members, and refuses to leave their side. His love with his ex-girlfriend, Nancy, also makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave his job.|$|R
25|$|Sixty-four-year-old William Frawley, a {{seasoned}} vaudevillian and movie character actor with nearly 100 film credits to his name, {{was a long}} shot to play Fred Mertz and only came into consideration after he telephoned Ball personally to ask {{if there was a}} role for him on her new show. Ball, who had only briefly known Frawley from her days at RKO, suggested him to both Arnaz and CBS. The network objected to the idea of casting Frawley, fearing that his excessive drinking—which was well known in Hollywood—would interfere with a commitment to a live show. Arnaz nonetheless liked Frawley and lobbied <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> have the role, {{even to the point of}} having Lucy scribes re-tailor the role of Fred Mertz to be a less financially successful and more curmudgeonly (in contrast to Gale Gordon's Mr. Atterbury) character to fit Frawley's persona. CBS relented only after Arnaz contractually bound Frawley to complete sobriety during the production of the show, and reportedly told the veteran actor that if he ever appeared on-set more than once in an intoxicated state he would be fired. Not once during Lucys nine seasons did Frawley's drinking ever interfere with his performance, and over time Arnaz became one of Frawley's few close friends.|$|E
500|$|Inspired, David {{assembled}} a team, including producer Lawrence Bender {{and former president}} of eBay Jeffrey Skoll, who met with Gore about the possibility of making the slide show into a movie. It took some convincing. The slide show, she says, [...] "was his baby, and he felt proprietary about it and it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> let go." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Wes Archer, and was written by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein. It was originally intended to deal with Homer and Marge's problematic sex life, but later developed into {{a story about the}} relationship between Homer and Grampa. Dan Castellaneta provides the voices for both Homer and Grampa. Castellaneta therefore had to talk to himself when he recorded the voices of the two characters in their interactions for this episode. Castellaneta says that it is <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> do Grampa's voice {{for an extended period of}} time because it is [...] "wheezy and airy".|$|E
5000|$|In Attack of the Clones, Anakin Skywalker feels [...] "smothered" [...] by Obi-Wan Kenobi and {{is unable}} to control his life. By Revenge of the Sith, however, his [...] "father-son" [...] {{friction}} with his master has matured into a more equal, brotherly relationship. Once he becomes Darth Vader, each evil act he commits shatters any hope or connection towards his previous life, which makes it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> return to the light, but he ultimately escapes the dark side and redeems himself by sacrificing his life to save his son Luke Skywalker and kill the Emperor in Return of the Jedi.|$|R
25|$|Green's {{increasing}} fame made it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> ambush {{people during}} man-on-the-street segments, leading <b>him</b> <b>to</b> target mostly {{senior citizens and}} non-English speakers. After {{he was diagnosed with}} testicular cancer in March 2000, he stopped production on his TV show, but he continued to appear on the channel via reruns and other promotional materials. Green's popularity during this time led <b>to</b> <b>him</b> gracing the cover of the June 8, 2000 issue of Rolling Stone magazine.|$|R
5000|$|Gang War was {{released}} {{prior to the}} film's release and [...] "served to escalate the gang war out onto the streets involving people outside of the closed off inter-gang politics." [...] Evans commented of this particular deleted scene as [...] "the <b>hardest</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> cut" [...] and explained that the reasons to cut the scene were [...] "entirely down to pacing issues." [...] No characters {{that appeared in the}} final cut were seen in this scene.|$|R
500|$|The man {{only known}} as [...] "Espantito" [...] (Spanish for [...] "Little Terror" [...] or [...] "Little Scare") {{was born on}} April 25, 1968 in Torreón, Coahuila, Mexico. Growing up in Torreón he became a wrestling fan at a young age, often {{watching}} local wrestlers Espanto II and Espanto III wrestle in his home town. In a 1999 interview he remarked that while his friends would cheer the técnicos (the faces, those that portray the [...] "good guys") while he personally always favored the rudos (those that portray the bad guys, also known as [...] "Heels"). While he {{wanted to become a}} luchador, it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> find a trainer willing to train someone of his diminutive stature, standing only [...] in his teens.|$|E
500|$|Georges-Claude Guilbert, {{author of}} Madonna as Postmodern Myth, {{compared}} her {{look in the}} video as a [...] "combination of Marilyn Monroe, Jean Seberg and Kim Novak." [...] He added that it was <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> believe that [...] " [...] {{did not know that}} she was going to cause a huge controversy with the video... With such a song and video, she was throwing in America's face the image of a country ravaged by the abortion debate, which is far from being resolved." [...] Lynda Hart, one of the authors of Acting Out: Feminist Performances, felt that the video [...] "alternated between two competing representations of Madonna... Charging coercion, both sides make the video as an invitation to a certain way of life, in the process denying it the stylistic invocation of a rhetoric of self-authorization." [...] At the 1987 MTV Video Music Awards, the [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] video won the Best Female Video award, and was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Overall Performance.|$|E
500|$|Political assassinations, {{attempted}} or successful, commonly occurred {{throughout the}} revolt. Al-Hajj Muhammad's refusal to participate did not seriously damage {{his relations with}} al-Husayni or the Central Committee, an organization which he depended on for war material. He frequented Damascus to obtain weapons and supplies {{as well as to}} discuss the situation in Palestine. However, an intelligence document from the British Mandatory authorities revealed that al-Hajj Muhammad left Palestine for Syria in October 1938 after being disaffected with the Central Committee's activities. The report states that he refused to send funds to the Committee, remarking [...] "The shoe of the most insignificant mujahid (fighter) is nobler than {{all the members of the}} Society, who have indulged in pleasure, while their brethren suffer in the mountains." [...] At one point, tensions emanating from al-Hajj Muhammad's refusal to carry out the killings of several men provided to him in a hit list by Da'ud al-Husayni on behalf of the Committee resulted in the cutting off of financial and material support for a certain period of time in 1938. This forced al-Hajj Muhammad to go to Jerusalem's chamber of commerce and the Ramallah municipality for funds. Another reason for his departure was the increased presence of informants within rebel ranks, making it <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> continue military activities.|$|E
60|$|Rollo sat still, and listened, but {{his father}} saw, from his looks, {{that he was not}} much {{interested}} in what he was saying; and he perceived that it was not at all probable that so small a boy could be reasoned into liking work. In fact, it was rather <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> Rollo to understand all that his father said,--and still <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> feel the force of it. He began to grow sleepy, and so his father let <b>him</b> go <b>to</b> bed.|$|R
5000|$|Jimmy Logan, a {{blue collar}} laborer whose once {{promising}} football career was ruined by a injury {{that left him}} with a permanent limp, is laid off from his construction job at the Charlotte Motor Speedway due to liability issues. While visiting his ex-wife Bobbi Joe to pick up their daughter for a beauty pageant, he learns that Bobbi and her new husband, a wealthy car dealership owner, intend to move to Lynchburg, making it even <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> visit.|$|R
5|$|Castiel is able {{to collect}} himself in time {{to return to the}} bunker and help Dean and the resurrected Mary Winchester find and rescue Sam. However, upon {{learning}} that Lucifer has escaped destruction, now jumping through vessels that rapidly burn out due to his weakened state making it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> maintain them, Castiel sets out to find Lucifer, accompanied by Crowley, although their first attempt simply sees Rowena banish Lucifer's new vessel {{to the bottom of the}} ocean without actually managing <b>to</b> kill <b>him.</b>|$|R
2500|$|While {{playing with}} the First Herd, Neal married Herman's vocalist, Frances Wayne. Playing with the band was very enjoyable for Hefti, which made it doubly <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> leave {{when he wanted to}} pursue {{arranging}} and composing full-time. Talking about Herman's band, Hefti said, ...|$|E
2500|$|David {{indicated}} {{after the}} sentencing {{that she would}} file a notice of appeal and indicated that Littlejohn remained silent. She maintained that he was framed to protect Dorrian.

2500|$|King is {{reported}} to have told Cronenberg that changes the director and Boam made to the story [...] "improved and intensified the power of the narrative." [...] In an interview with film critic Christopher Hicks, Boam said that the success of the movie is generally credited to Cronenberg, and that King wouldn't give Boam credit for writing a good script. He said, [...] "It's <b>hard</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> admit that he's not the one who could crack that book. But I think that movie holds together as a real movie. It's not just some kind of weird concoction of Stephen King's." ...|$|E
50|$|Palmer {{was happy}} to see his {{grandson}} Bobby back in town, until he realized that Bobby had never really grown up. Bobby bilked money out of Edmund Grey before leaving town, without a goodbye to Palmer. A few months later, he was shocked when newcomer Diana Cole claimed to be his supposedly deceased niece, Dixie. He believed what she was saying and was devastated when it turned out that she was lying. It was much <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> accept when the real Dixie turned up alive and well.|$|R
5000|$|MetalSucks is a {{heavy metal}} music-themed news website. The site {{features}} reviews, interviews, information on latest metal releases and blog-like posts from the writers. It was founded in December 2006 by two friends who use the pen names Vince Neilstein and Axl Rosenberg. They chose those names because [...] "if {{the father of a}} fourteen year old girl you met at an Avenged Sevenfold show is looking for you, and he thinks your name is 'Axl Rosenberg,' it's {{going to be a lot}} <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> track you down." ...|$|R
5000|$|One legend {{attributes}} {{the start of}} the tradition of keeping ravens with clipped wings in the Tower of London to Charles II and to his royal astronomer John Flamsteed, although there are versions of the legend that differ in their details. [...] According to one legend, John Flamsteed complained to Charles II that wild ravens were flying past his telescope and making it <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> <b>to</b> observe the sky from his observatory in the White Tower. Flamsteed requested that the birds be removed, but Charles II refused to comply with this request.|$|R
