5|$|Plans {{to build}} a new stadium in Malmö {{originated}} in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö <b>IP</b> <b>to</b> be too small for major events. However, the city council could not agree where to build the new stadium, and the matter was dropped for the time being. It was not until Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup that the question resurfaced. The location of the stadium was a main subject of discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, while others thought that the stadium should be located in central Malmö, near the neighbourhood of Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954.|$|E
5|$|Malmö Stadion {{served as}} the home ground of {{association}} football club Malmö FF between 1958 and 2008. The team moved to the stadium on its opening in 1958, leaving its original home ground at Malmö <b>IP</b> <b>to</b> do so. The first Malmö FF match at the new ground was played on 8 August 1958; in an Allsvenskan fixture, Malmö FF took on their cross-town rivals, IFK Malmö, who had also moved to the stadium from Malmö IP. Played in front of 17,368 fans, the game ended with a 4–4 draw. IFK were relegated from Allsvenskan in 1962, and have not returned to the first tier since, but the club continues to play at Malmö Stadion nonetheless. Malmö FF experienced an average attendance of around 13,000 for the first ten years at the stadium; average crowds then dropped to below 10,000 {{by the end of}} the 1970s. By the 1990s, attendances were at an all-time low, with less than 5,000 people on average coming to Malmö FF matches. The club therefore let Malmö Stadion for the newly renovated Malmö IP in 1999, IFK Malmö followed in August the same year. By this time IFK Malmö were playing in Division 2, then the third tier in the Swedish league system. During their seasons in Allsvenskan, IFK Malmö had attracted an average attendance of around 10,000 spectators between 1957–58 and 1962. IFK Malmö's attendance at Malmö Stadion reached its peak during the 1960 season when the club finished as runners-up in Allsvenskan and attracted 12,787 spectators on average to the stadium. The attendance had decreased to around 1,000 spectators per match in 1999 when the club had dropped in the league.|$|E

25|$|Pakistani {{theoretical}} physicists, such as Faheem Hussain, Peter Rotolli, John Mumtaz, Fayyazuddin, Ishfaq Ahmad, and Masud Ahmad, {{had begun}} research on theoretical and quantum physics. Faheem Hussain {{became the first}} physicist at <b>IP</b> <b>to</b> published research analysis on string theory. Later on, the Relativity Group under Fayyazuddin carried out work on the Bethe-Bloch theory. In 1969, Raziuddin Siddiqui established Einstein's Physics Group (EPG) and carried out experiments on general relativity and quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The left-wing Patriotic Party (VP) {{campaigned on}} a Kemalist platform, {{claiming}} that the CHP had strayed away from the principles of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Claiming that they would form 'Atatürk's government', with VP leader Doğu Perinçek stating that they would join the CHP {{as long as the}} party upheld Atatürk's principles. The party had changed its name from Workers' Party (<b>İP)</b> <b>to</b> Patriotic Party during a party congress on 15 February 2015. The VP also claimed that voting for the HDP would be the same as voting for the PKK terrorist organisation and accused the HDP of forcing a VP parliamentary candidate in Hakkâri to defect to them at gunpoint.|$|E
25|$|By the 1950s it {{had become}} clear to the local {{authorities}} that Malmö's interest for football and other sports was becoming too big for Malmö <b>IP</b> <b>to</b> accommodate. Malmö FF in particular had high average attendances year on year, and matches were often sold out. Apart from the issue of growing popularity, the large crowds raised security issues that became apparent in the Scanian derby game between Malmö FF and Helsingborgs IF in 1951—amid considerable commotion in the stands some people were pushed against poles and fences, but nobody was seriously injured. Plans for a new stadium were first drawn up in 1943, when local officials deemed Malmö <b>IP</b> <b>to</b> be too small for major events, but council members differed on where to build the new stadium. The matter was dropped until 1954, when Sweden was chosen to host the 1958 FIFA World Cup, with matches {{to take place in}} Malmö. The new ground's location was a central issue in the discussion: some suggested a suburban location in Jägersro, to the city's south-east, while others called for a stadium in central Malmö, near the city's main park, Pildammsparken. Proponents of a central location ultimately won the day; the site was confirmed in 1954. Malmö Stadion was built on the southern side of Pildammsparken, opposite from the northern site occupied by Malmö IP. Malmö FF and IFK Malmö both moved to Malmö Stadion on its completion in 1958.|$|E

There, Ip desires to open a school to {{propagate}} his art, as well as make a living during the difficult times, but he has difficulty attracting students due to his lack of reputation in the city.

Wong leaves humiliated, only to return with some friends to gang up on him. Ip beats them as well. Stunned and impressed by his skills, Wong and his friends become Ip's first students, bringing more disciples to help the school thrive.|$|E
25|$|Besides content filtering, other {{imperfect}} {{methods for}} cross-site scripting mitigation are also commonly used. One {{example is the}} use of additional security controls when handling cookie-based user authentication. Many web applications rely on session cookies for authentication between individual HTTP requests, and because client-side scripts generally have access to these cookies, simple XSS exploits can steal these cookies. To mitigate this particular threat (though not the XSS problem in general), many web applications tie session cookies to the IP address of the user who originally logged in, then only permit that <b>IP</b> <b>to</b> use that cookie. This is effective in most situations (if an attacker is only after the cookie), but obviously breaks down in situations where an attacker is behind the same NATed IP address or web proxy as the victim, or the victim is changing his or her mobile IP.|$|E

30|$|Adopting the ‘objectivist’ {{approach}} (Klaes 2000) of objectively {{measuring the}} value of <b>IP</b> transaction <b>to</b> firms, we used the net present value (NPV) methodology (Fisher 1930; Magni 2009) that is regarded robust in theory and prevalent in practice for financial investment decisions to quantify the benefit of in-licensing PRIs’ <b>IPs</b> <b>to</b> the firms. This is done by totalling the sum of projected or extrapolated commercial revenue streams from the royalty-bearing IP licensing transactions - also known as Realised Imputed Commercial Value (RICV).|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the responses of}} Fuji MS, SR, and TR imaging plates (<b>IPs)</b> <b>to</b> protons with energies ranging from 0. 6 to 3. 2 MeV. Monoenergetic protons were produced with the 3. 5 MV AIFIRA (Applications Interdisciplinaires de Faisceaux d'Ions en Région Aquitaine) accelerator at the Centre d'Etudes Nucléaires de Bordeaux Gradignan (CENBG). The IPs were irradiated with protons backscattered off a tantalum target. We present the photo-stimulated luminescence response of the IPs together with the fading measurements for these IPs. A method is applied to allow correction of fading effects for variable proton irradiation duration. Using the IP fading corrections, {{a model of the}} <b>IP</b> response function <b>to</b> protons was developed. The model enables extrapolation of the <b>IP</b> response <b>to</b> protons up to proton energies of 10 MeV. Our work is finally compared to previous works conducted on Fuji TR <b>IP</b> response <b>to</b> protons...|$|R

Players battle varied enemies, including bosses, using items such as swords and firearms, and journey through the story, exploring the game's different locations, interacting with non-player characters, collecting key items involved in the story, and discovering and unraveling the world's many mysteries. Bloodborne began development in 2012 under the working title of Project Beast. Bearing many similarities to the Souls series of games by the same company, Bloodborne was partially inspired by the literary works of authors H. P.
