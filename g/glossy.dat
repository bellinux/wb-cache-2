5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar: This {{subspecies}} {{grows in}} coastal Queensland {{as far north}} as Proserpine. For most of its range it is the only subspecies, but near its southern limit it co-occurs with B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. The two subspecies are distinguishable by their leaves, which are larger and <b>glossy</b> with wavy margins on B.integrifolia subsp. compar.|$|E

5|$|Critchlow {{was also}} commended for the risky {{decision}} to write, draw and publish the comic himself. The comic was compared favourably with professional quality comics, with {{its lack of}} adverts viewed as an advantage over those offerings. The high production values were also praised, with the <b>glossy</b> cover and high quality paper used for the inner pages.|$|E
5|$|During the Cold War, {{camouflage}} {{was partially}} abandoned; for example, <b>glossy</b> anti-flash white was used on aircraft as protection from nuclear flash, including high-flying Royal Air Force nuclear weapon-carrying V-bombers. When SAMs made high level attack too dangerous, {{the plans for}} RAF bombers changed to low level attack and camouflaged top surfaces returned.|$|E
5|$|In midsummer the strigs {{of green}} fruit ripen to edible berries, very dark purple in colour, almost black, with <b>glossy</b> skins and {{persistent}} calyxes at the apex, each containing many seeds. An established bush can produce about 4.5 kilograms (10 pounds) of fruit each year.|$|E

2500|$|Henry's {{photography}} {{studio at}} the mall continued to see much success, so much {{that by the end}} of the third season he received an offer from the magnate of <b>Glossy's,</b> a photo studio franchise, for a $100,000 buyout of Warnimont's, which also included the offer of Henry becoming manager of the <b>Glossy's</b> location. Henry accepted, but soon found that his creativity and business style was not being appreciated by his new employers. He quit <b>Glossy's,</b> but then decided to give into Punky's and Cherie's dream to run their own teen hangout/burger establishment, and invested into another mall property which ended up being splashed with as much color and originality as Punky's bedroom. All involved, which even included Betty and Margaux, unanimously decided on christening it [...] "Punky's Place." [...] Into season four, much of the action continued to take place {{at the mall}}, with Henry, Punky and her friends' efforts to keep their new restaurant afloat and the many teenage misadventures which passed through at Punky's Place.|$|R

50|$|Another Gent {{magazine}} {{was published in}} Japan in the 1980s. Targeted at local fans of Western adult films, it was unrelated to the American publication and had a <b>glossier</b> look.|$|R
5|$|Immature American {{white and}} scarlet ibises are very {{difficult}} to tell apart, although scarlet ibises tend to have darker legs and bare skin around the face. An immature American white ibis could be mistaken for an immature <b>glossy</b> ibis, but the latter is wholly dark brown and lacks the white belly and rump. The adult is distinguishable from the wood stork, which is much larger and its wings have more black on them.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and <b>glossy</b> black. A gust of wind or contact with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E
5|$|Novisuccinea chittenangoensis {{has a small}} (an {{average of}} 20.9mm in length in adult individuals), delicate, ovate shell of 3¼ whorls, with deep sutures. The shell is almost translucent, and varies in color from a chalky pale yellow to white, with a <b>glossy</b> surface.

5|$|One species, {{the cattle}} egret, was {{historically}} an African bird. In the 20th century this bird colonized North America {{and is now}} found throughout the lower 48 states of the United States. The cattle egret is the only Old World bird to establish itself in North America in historical times without being introduced by humans. As such, it is not marked as introduced on this list. Neither is the <b>glossy</b> ibis, which probably had a similar history.|$|E
5|$|Since medieval times, dubbin, a waxy product, {{was used}} to soften and {{waterproof}} leather; however, it did not impart shine. It was made from natural wax, oil, soda ash and tallow. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high <b>glossy</b> finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, a variety of homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with lanolin or beeswax as a base.|$|E
5|$|Slender {{with thin}} legs {{and a short}} tail, the four-horned {{antelope}} has a yellowish brown to reddish coat. The underparts and the insides of the legs are white.

The hair feels coarse, more {{like that of a}} deer than the <b>glossy</b> hair typical of antelopes. The fetlocks are marked with white patches.|$|E

5|$|Some Scotch bonnets have a {{completely}} smooth and <b>glossy</b> shell. This {{was thought to}} be a different species which was given the name cicatricosa by Gmelin in 1791. This taxon was recognized for a while, including up until 2010 as a separate species, Semicassis cicatricosa. However, in 2015 this is considered to be only a form, therefore S. cicatricosa has become another synonym of S. granulata.|$|E
5|$|The 1967 film An Evening in Paris {{is mostly}} remembered because it {{featured}} Bollywood actress Sharmila Tagore {{as the first}} Indian actress to wear a bikini on film. She also posed in a bikini for the <b>glossy</b> Filmfare magazine. The costume shocked a conservative Indian audience, but it also {{set in motion a}} trend carried forward by Zeenat Aman in Heera Panna (1973) and Qurbani (1980), Dimple Kapadia in Bobby (1973), and Parveen Babi in Yeh Nazdeekiyan (1982).|$|E

The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.|$|E
50|$|It may be {{distinguished}} from the related loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) by the somewhat longer, <b>glossier</b> needles and larger red-brown cones, and from longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) by the shorter, more slender needles and smaller cones with less broad scales.|$|R
