40|$|AbstractWe {{carried out}} a {{combined}} thermal and magnetic evaluation on experimentally knapped clasts of different lithologies (chert, quartzite, limestone, sandstone and obsidian) heated under controlled field and temperature conditions. The main {{aim of this study}} is to estimate the feasibility of use of these raw materials, which are commonly found in prehistoric archaeological sites for archaeomagnetic purposes. Rock magnetic analysis included measurements of low-field magnetic susceptibility, isothermal remanent magnetisation (IRM) acquisition curves, hysteresis loops and thermomagnetic curves of lithic clasts both before and after experimental heating. All lithologies, except the obsidian, recorded an increase of up two orders of magnitude in their magnetic concentration-dependent parameters revealing the formation of new ferrimagnetic minerals. Obsidian and sandstone are the most reliable magnetic carriers, followed by limestone, chert and quartzite. Magnetic susceptibility values show significant differences among lithologies. Isothermal remanent magnetisation proved also to be highly discriminatory as well as the room temperature hysteresis parameters. The main macroscopic alterations resulted in colour changes, rubefactions, potlids in cherts and the massive formation of <b>internal</b> <b>fissures</b> in obsidian specimens. The multispecimen palaeointensity technique was applied on selected samples yielding satisfactory results for heated obsidian and sandstone samples.

It asks how Turkish diasporic identity is formed and shaped by discourses that frame Turks, and that interrogate who or what a ‘Turk’ is? This thesis suggests that this process of continual construction and re-construction of diasporic consciousness should be investigated as a matter of competitive identity formation, meaning that there is competition between multiple actors to impose a definition or label on a diasporic group and to achieve broad-based support for that label or definition. This also implies the attribution of specific values, ideas, and political agendas to that group.

40|$|Although native bismuth is a {{relatively}} common mineral, native antimony is less abundant, and Sb-Bi alloys are relatively rare phases in Nature. Sb-Bi alloys and Ag-Cu-Pb-Sb-Bi sulphosalts have been discovered in the Jialong vein-type Cu-Sn deposit in North Guangxi, South China. The Jialong deposit is hosted by schist within the contact zone of a Neoproterozoic granite. Four stages of ore formation are recognised, with the Sb-Bi alloy- and sulphosalt-bearing assemblage formed during the third stage. Sulphosalts include Pb-Bi-Ag sulphosalts (pavonite), Sb-Bi sulphosalts (tintinaite, terrywallaceite), and Sb sulphosalt (ullmanite, freibergite, bournonite). Grains of Sb-Bi alloy measure 2 – 20 μm in diameter, show rounded margins and occur together with galena along the edges or <b>internal</b> <b>fissures</b> of sulphosalts. The Sb-Bi alloys do not coexist with bismuthinite, BiS (an unnamed mineral), or with native bismuth. Two phases of Sb-Bi alloys are identified based on back-scattered electron image observations and electron microprobe analysis.

40|$|One of {{the factors}} which {{affect the quality of}} rice during milling is <b>internal</b> <b>fissures</b> created during and after drying operation. In many {{industrial}} countries intermittent drying method is hired to reduce the moisture content of rough rice {{in order to reduce the}} drying time and maintain the quality of the final product. A high percentage of rice breakage during milling process, at least in Iran, necessitates performing the intermittent drying process and optimize it for Iranian varieties. In this study, the effect of this method (drying-tempering) and continuous drying method (no tempering) on fissuring percentage of Hashemi (long grain) and Koohsar (medium grain) varieties was investigated. The experiments were carried out at constant drying and tempering temperature of 60 °C, drying durations of 20, 40 and 60 min, and tempering durations of 0 (continuous drying), 40, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240 min. The results revealed that the tempering process significantly reduced the drying time and ﬁssured kernels percentage. Moreover, for both varieties it was observed that the rice fissuring decreased significantly by continuing the tempering process until certain durations. Overall, for optimization of intermittent drying process in terms of the considered qualitative parameters, i. e. reducing energy consumption and losses, conducting 160 and 200 min tempering process after 40 min drying was found appropriate for Hashemi and Koohsar varieties, respectively. In addition, according to the higher fissuring for Koohsar (medium grain) compared to Hashemi (long grain), it can be concluded that physical properties such as kernel slenderness ratio is effective on its fissuring...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade of the fourteenth century, German Waldensian {{communities}} became targets of a wave of inquisitorial campaigns. A significant part of these campaigns, unmatched by any other waves of anti-heretical persecution during the century, was perpetrated by mobile inquisitors—professional itinerant “heresy-hunters”—who served as catalysts for anti-heretical actions throughout the German lands. Analyzing and reconstructing the “careers” and motivations of these agents of persecution, this dissertation aims to outline a constellation of factors—social, political, cultural, and religious—that enabled itinerant inquisitors to intensify anti-Waldensian persecution in Germany during one decade. Three itinerant inquisitors—Martin of Amberg, Peter Zwicker, and Heinrich Angermeier—reacted, among other factors, to the <b>internal</b> <b>fissures</b> and problems within Waldensian communities across the German-speaking lands, as well as to the relative absence of stable institutions charged with repression of heterodoxy in Central Europe. Rise of city-centric ideology in German towns, as well as significant Waldensian communities there provided inquisitors with a particularly powerful way of establishing their authority in urban environments fraught with conflict. Motivated in part by the reformist ideology and religious developments in Prague, the Empire’s cultural and intellectual center, itinerant “heresy hunters” sought to strengthen Christian faith and Western Christendom as a whole by re-routing illicit spirituality into Catholic venues by promoting persuasion and conversion as methods of combating Waldensianism. Relying on networks of prestige, diplomacy, and influence that united the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, inquisitors also formed their own long-distance networks of persecutors, informers, and recent converts, which allowed them to pursue heresy more effectively and across all of the German territories...|$|R

Firstly, it examines the dominant self-perceptions and international projections of both countries and their relation to each other in light of globalisation and economic progress. Secondly, this project analyses how power relations are deployed in official discourse, particularly regarding Australian-Chilean relations and to what extent they suggest mutual geopolitical asymmetries where capital has been placed at the centre. Taking these elements into consideration, this study deconstructs and examines the central features and performative functions of a selection of Chilean and Australian governmental discourses between 1990 and 2012 as well as bilateral news in both Australian and Chilean newspapers. This research combines theoretical tools from Latin American and English-speaking cultural studies with Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) methodology. The latter gives a proper context to analyse the way two countries such as Australia and Chile portray transnational similarities and imbalances. With these two groups of concepts, this project traces the bilateral construction that has facilitated transoceanic exchange and interrogates the interrelation involving official discourses, social power and identity constructions. This study maintains that the dominant discourse of each nation around economic progress and regional exceptionality has led to a closer approach between these two countries, albeit in a context of bilateral asymmetries and <b>internal</b> <b>fissures</b> regarding national cohesion. Additionally, this thesis ascertains that the national discourse both in Chile and in Australia remains fractured as a consequence of a hegemonic Eurocentric vision regarding the nation-building project.

40|$|Micro X-ray {{fluorescence}} (micro-XRF) {{analysis and}} neutron imaging techniques, namely 2 D radiography and 3 D tomography, {{have been applied}} {{for the study of}} four metal axes from the Early/Middle Bronze Age in Western Iberia, a period characterized by a metallurgical change in the use of copper to bronze. Micro-XRF analysis has shown that one of the axes was produced in copper with some arsenic while the other three were produced in a copper-tin alloy (bronze) with variable tin contents and some arsenic and lead. Neutron radiography and tomographywere applied to study internal heterogeneities of the axes in a non-invasiveway since the specificities of neutron interaction with matter allow a suitable penetration of these relatively thick copper-based objects when compared to the use of a conventional X-ray radiography. Neutron imaging allowed the visualization of <b>internal</b> <b>fissures</b> and pores and the evaluation of their distribution, size and shape. Relevant information for the reconstruction of ancient manufacturing techniques was gathered, revealing that one ax was produced with the mold in an angle of ≈ 25 °, probably to facilitate gas escape during metal pouring. Also, information regarding physical weaknesses of the axes was collected, providing relevant data for their conservation. Novelty statement: The present paper combines the use of micro-XRF and neutron imaging techniques, namely (2 D) radiography and (3 D) tomography for the study of prehistoric metal axes. The XRF spectra allowed identifying major and minor elements present in the alloys, inferring on the absence of elements that could become radioactive {{for a long period of}} time after irradiation with neutrons. The specificities of neutron interaction with matter allowed a suitable penetration of these relatively thick copper-based objects when compared to the use of a conventional X-ray radiography. The combination of these non-destructive techniques allowed the evaluation of the metal composition and the internal structure of the axes. Micro-XRF allowed the distinction among copper and bronze axes, and provided data about the composition of early bronzes for which data is scarce. The neutron imaging study allowed for the first timethe visualization of internal heterogeneities in early bronze axes, namely pores and large voids, providing relevant information for the reconstruction of ancient manufacturing techniques and raising pertinent information regarding physical weaknesses of these types of objects. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Coal mining was {{widespread}} in the central belt of Scotland from 1830 until the 1970 ’s and created a legacy of waste tips or ‘bings’ that still dot the landscape. High content of coal fines and carbonaceous shales, make bings very prone to self-heating and smoldering combustion. A 30 m high waste heap at Bogside, North Lanarkshire, Scotland, started to smoulder in 2009, approximately 80 years after {{the closure of the}} pit and waste dumping. Induced smouldering, a flameless combustion process, of soils contaminated with tar, PAHs, heavy oils and other organic compounds is a promising technology for the remediation of brown field sites, but has hitherto been conducted on an experimental scale of several hundred tonnes. But the large scale phenomena of burning bings provide a unique opportunity to study a ‘natural’ analogue for smouldering remediation. Chemical, geotechnical and physical parameters of the Bogside Bing have been studied. A combustion front is moving from west to east along the axis of the tip at an approximate rate of 1 m/month and three well-defined zones were identified and mapped using thermal imagery and temperature probes: the undisturbed zone, the preheating plus drying zone and the combustion zone. The subsurface fire is resulting in a detrimental effect to the vegetation and structural integrity of the heap. Spread of the combustion is accompanied by the development of vents ahead of the front and fissures that run parallel to the direction of heating and smaller landslips along the flanks. It is probable that changes to the soil mechanics’ of the tip induced by the smouldering front create a network of fissures, some running deep, that supply the front with enough air to sustain the process. Analysis of gas from the vents, show elevated CO 2, CO, CH 4 and SO 2, and partially depleted in oxygen. All these are indicative of smouldering activity deep into the tip. The primary environmental concern is likely to be from SO 2 release, although the stability of the structure may be compromised. Understanding the development of <b>internal</b> <b>fissures</b> and their role in sustaining the combustion process is crucial to utilizing smouldering as a remediation method for large areas of land contaminated by organic compounds.

40|$|Thesis (MA (History)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. In this {{research}} the early {{development of the}} Black Sash is briefly explored, together with how it altered over time. Changes in the internal structures {{and its effect on}} the membership are benchmarked, together with the reasons and reasoning that compelled the organization to undertake a complete restructuring. An in-depth study is made of the disorientation brought about by the collapse of apartheid. Particular attention is paid to the resistance to, and ultimate acceptance of, the inevitability of offering a professionalized service. Attention is focused on the relationship between the Black Sash as a white women’s protest movement and the wider white community, content in the main to support apartheid. The degree to which the Black Sash was accepted by the black community as an equal partner in the struggle for a democratic South Africa is discussed and the criteria by which the organization has been evaluated. In addition, liberalism, per se, is evaluated from a “grassroots” perspective. From 1973, socio-economic developments in the wider society saw many Black Sash members returning to the workplace. This left them with little or no time to offer the organization during formal working hours. In order for the work to continue, paid staff had to be employed to augment the volunteer component. During the 1986 States of Emergency, members of banned organizations joined the Black Sash, and it became an amalgam of different views, generations and political opinion. This represented a significant ontological shift and altered its character {{in the eyes of the}} public, but also created <b>internal</b> <b>fissures.</b> The focus of {{this research}} is on the response of the Black Sash and its membership to the changing environment in which it was forced to function. By the 1980 s, members were finding it difficult to relate to the new protest movements that were rapidly gaining black support and the black on black violence. Ultimately, except for its service arm, namely the advice offices, it emerged as an organization in limbo, appealing neither to the white minority nor the black majority. Women from other race groups, whose membership would have corrected the demographic imbalance, were reluctant to join a predominantly white organization with a tangible camaraderie, built up over the years as a result of members’ shared backgrounds and experiences. This threatened its effectiveness as an advocacy group, and access to the funding that was a vital element in its survival. Structural changes offered the only solution. One of the intentions of this research is to draw attention to the reinvented Black Sash Trust. As a multi-racial, multi-gender, professionalized NGO, managed and staffed by salaried personnel of all age groups, with minimal white volunteer input, it has replaced the two-tiered membership based structure, with a semiprofessional service arm. Having redefined its role and as the end product of slow, almost imperceptible but unavoidable innovations over time, it is developing its own identity, which encompasses much of the original Black Sash ethos...|$|R
40|$|Grouting {{constitutes}} one of {{the most}} common techniques applied for the repair and strengthening of masonry structures or fissured architectural members, when interconnected voids in adequate percentage are present. This technique can also be appropriate for the in situ consolidation of detached and cracked mosaics and wall paintings. Although grouting is a non-reversible technique, it is well accepted even in monuments of high historical and architectural value, since it has the advantage to retrieve the continuity, cohesion and strength of the damaged structures without altering their morphology, geometry and load-bearing system. To achieve this goal, the design of the grout composition should satisfy a series of performance requirements involving injectability, strength and durability aspects. Nevertheless, the careful design of the grout composition cannot by its own ensure the successful completion of the grouting intervention. Evidently, particular care has to be taken for the execution of the whole intervention in situ. One of the major parameters affecting the adequate application of the technique is the installation of the grout entrance and exit tubes so as to reach the <b>internal</b> voids, <b>fissures</b> and discontinuities present between masonry leafs or between leafs and infill material. In this paper, the importance of a detailed geometrical survey of all masonry faces and their pathology will be presented, together with the methodology to be followed in order to design the grid of grouting tubes to be installed. Furthermore, the type of tubes and the way of their installation will be described. This procedure consists of different phases, which need a detailed design and programming and constitute a prerequisite for achieving strength increase and improvement of the monolithic behaviour of the damaged masonry. The whole procedure will be highlighted using as an example the case of the piers of the drum of the Katholikon of Daphni Monastery...|$|R
40|$|Clay shale landscapes are {{sensitive}} to landslide, erosion, and re-sedimentation processes. In this context, tectonized clay shales have peculiar hydrological and mechanical behaviours. In order to improve {{our understanding of the}} processes involved in such systems, an experimental site has been settled in the Draix Observatory (ORE DRAIX) on a black marl hill slope of the Southern Alps (France) in the framework of the ECOU-PREF project. The site is a natural laboratory to study the evolution of clay shale landscapes at several scales (regional to µm). In this study, we aim to characterize the <b>internal</b> structure and <b>fissure</b> patterns of a stable interfluve, in order to locate preferential water flows within the system, and anticipate its evolution. This work is based on a series of mutli-disciplinary approaches including petrophysical analyses, well pulse injection tests and downhole geophysical measurements. Borehole geophysical results were combined with laboratory measurements on core plugs (permeability, density, porosity, and acoustic velocity). Optical and acoustical images have been used as an original tool for internal discontinuities characterisation and potential active flow path detection. They allowed the identification of three main lithological units interpreted as several stages of shale alteration. In addition, several main structural plane discontinuities (open fractures, schistosity planes, and fractures infilled with calcite or clays) were identified from the images and their potential transmissivity discussed with regard to piezometric and tracer measurements. In all, the integration of measurements leads to propose a simple scenario of fluid circulation and chemical alteration of the interfluve...|$|R
40|$|The {{thermomechanical}} {{behavior of}} natural phlogopite mica specimens from seven different origins is characterized. An initial heat treatment, to a temperature between 300 °C and 400 °C, {{is found to}} form fissures that stabilize in the material. Following the initial heat treatment, all the phlogopite specimens, regardless of their origin and polytype, exhibit the extraordinarily large thermal expansion (intumescence), more than 200 % at 600 °C, in the direction perpendicular to the basal planes. This phenomenon is strictly reproducible when tested under a range of thermal conditions including thermal shock, multiple thermal fatigue cycles, varying heating or cooling rates and isothermal heating over an extensive period of time at different temperatures up to 585 °C. The hysteresis, associated with the thermal cycle, is increased when the specimen is heated or cooled at a faster rate. The maximum coefficient of linear thermal expansion, approximately 10 - 2 °C- 1, is observed over the temperature range 100 - 120 °C. This {{is due to the}} non-structural water, entrapped within the layer structure, which undergoes a phase transition and causes the mica layers to expand abruptly. A model of lenticular fissures is developed based on thin-plate mechanics and thermodynamics assumptions. The state of a lenticular fissure with water vapor molecules is determined to correlate the experimental parameters with the material properties. The average density of water vapor molecules within a lenticular fissure is calculated to be ∼ 1025 m 3 for the temperature interval between 100 °C and 275 °C. The concentration of non-structure water, based on the model calculation, is less than 0. 1 % by weight. Acoustic emission (AE) signals have been reported by Pranevicius et al. (1995) to correspond to the microstructure changes as the <b>internal</b> lenticular <b>fissures</b> develop in phlogopite. This technique has also been proven feasible to characterize the thermomechanical behavior of other layer structures (Pranevicius 1995). Other layer structures are reviewed to determine their potential reversible thermomechanical properties. When phlogopite is used as a model specimen to relate microstructure to intumescence, two criteria are established for selection of the layer structures of potential intumescence. The first is the need for flexible and elastic layers to withstand the strain imposed by large lateral expansion. The second is the requirement of a high degree for intercalation. Possible candidates that fit these two criteria are identified. Finally, a few potential applications of layer structures of intumescence are discussed, and future research in this area is proposed.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} state-led development on the Reang ethnic minority of Tripura (Northeast India). Tripura is a border territory subjected to dramatic political change in the last century. Development shapes {{the relations between the}} state and ethnic minorities particularly those living in the margins such as the Reangs. Development is used to civilise, formalise and empower marginalised communities creating complex encounters with modernity. Communities often resist or reject development; actions which have become the main focus in academic and policy writings. However, by analysing the Reang experience of development, this thesis challenges the commonly held notions that Reang are either incapable of development or actively reject or resent development. Reang experiences of development reveal a desire for inclusion and participation, altering intra-tribal dynamics and also in their relationships with the dominant Bengali community. I argue that for the Reangs, state-led development is desired, pursued and remains integral to how they see their place in contemporary India. Development is subject to contestation and even resistance, but also acquiescence. This complexity is best seen through analysis of changing ethnic identity, migration and gender. The thesis has two conclusions. First, the postcolonial Indian state homogenises the Reangs through development policies that cause economic, livelihood and gender-based uncertainties. Furthermore the state continues to reproduce ethnic categories that homogenise the Reangs and thus development policies do not adequately address these uncertainties. Yet, the Reang case demonstrates complex ways in which tribal subjects engage with the modern state that calls for a much greater attention to minority experiences with development and their position within the modern state. Second, development creates complex <b>internal</b> ruptures and <b>fissures</b> within the Reang population. These fissures reflect both the promises of development and its failures and the various ways in which members of the Reang community in Tripura respond...|$|R

We present results from a detailed field investigation of the proximal deposits of episode 1 of the 1969 fissure eruption of Mauna Ulu, Kīlauea, Hawai‘i. Exceptional preservation of the deposits allows us to reconstruct vent-proximal lava drainage patterns and to assess the role that drainage played in constraining vent localization. Through detailed field mapping, including measurements of the height and internal depth of lava tree moulds, we reconstruct high-resolution topographic maps of the pre-eruption ground surface, the lava high-stand surface and the post-eruption ground surface. We calculate the difference in elevation between pairs of maps to estimate the lava inundation depth and lava drainage depth over the field area and along different segments of fissure. Aerial photographs collected during episode 1 of the eruption allow us to locate those parts of the fissure that are no longer exposed at the surface. By comparing with the inundation and drainage maps, we find that fissure segments that were inundated with lava to greater depths (typically 1 – 6 m) during the eruption later became foci of lava drainage back into the <b>fissure</b> (<b>internal</b> drain-back). We infer that, in these areas, lava ponding over the fissure suppressed discharge of magma, thereby favouring drain-back and stagnation. By contrast, segments with relatively shallow inundation (typically less than ~ 1 m), such as where the fissure intersects pre-eruptive topographic highs, or where flow away from the vent (outflow) was efficient, are often associated with sub-circular vent geometries in the post-eruption ground surface. We infer that these parts of the fissure became localization points for ongoing magma ascent and discharge. We conclude that lava inundation and drainage processes in basaltic fissure eruptions can {{play an important role in}} controlling their localization and longevity...|$|R
40|$|This master thesis {{investigated}} {{the origin of}} the seemingly perennial (base) flow in a hydrological complex, Inselberg (a type of mountain) dominated catchment in the Municipality of Messica, Manica Province, Mozambique. Smallholders rely on these perennial flows, since they have three growth seasons, two of them during the dry period. This year-round agriculture is of pivotal importance for dwellers’ (economical) situation and contributes significantly to Mozambique’s food supply. However, there are many (hydrological) unknowns. How much groundwater is stored where, and how much water can be expected during the growth season. More knowledge will improve plant and irrigation schemes, minimize losses and prevent over-exploitation. The Messica Irrigation Pilot Project (MIPP) searches for hydrological answers and tries to provide practical and theoretical insights. Therefore, students performed measurements (e. g., precipitation, water levels, discharges, cross-sections) in the 220 km 2 large Messica Catchment since December 2012 up to August 2014. Most measurements have been performed at Godi Downstream (a headwater from the mountainous ridge). This perennial stream is small and abundantly vegetated. Another important measurement point is a free flow three-gated bridge downstream in the River Messica. Unfortunately, limited measurements are done here. Overall, the entire Messica Catchment is parsimoniously measured. Scientists also strive to improve ’Prediction in Ungauged Basins’ (PUB). This research took place in recent years. (Parts of) its knowledge and insights are used in this study. This master thesis continued on earlier theses, together they contribute to MIPP’s initiatives on three points. With this insights and practical methods, one might predict headwater baseflow one to two growth seasons ahead. This study proposes (1) the ’conveyance method’ to predict baseflow recession using cross-sectional corrected water levels (conveyances). Conveyances are measured continuously and are obtained directly, as opposed to discharge measurements. This method is based on uniform flow and linear (groundwater) reservoir assumptions together with a known cross-section. The conveyances C and discharges Q are linear related. The bottomslope and roughness are combined in one constant a. From this, we derived groundwater response timescales Ks, and hence, estimated the baseflow recession. Godi’s recession timescale is about 550 days. Together with some additional discharge measurements we are able to calculate discharges two growth seasons ahead. Inselbergs are very steep mountains, ridges or isolated hills in gently sloped areas. They are omnipresent in the Manica province, just as in other parts of East and West Africa. Normally they consist of solid, barely erodible TTG (Tonalite, Trondhjemite, or Granites) materials, as it is the case for the Kalahari Craton, where Messica is located on. Just East of Messica, the Kalahari borders the Barue Complex. Water storage in these solid Inselbergs is not obvious. However, literature study showed that Messica’s mountain ridge belongs to the later deposed Gairezi Sedimentary Group on top of the Kalahari Craton. It forms a 220 km long belt from Sussendenga in the South to Guru in the North. The Gairezi consists of quartszites and metapelic schists, with internal westward-dipping inclinations. These mountains contain <b>internal</b> cracks and <b>fissures,</b> where water storage can take place. We developed two Flexible Topography driven, conceptual rainfall runoff (FlexTopo) models (FlexA and FlexC) with an additional output conversion model (OCM) to calibrate on conveyances. FlexA serves as a lumped benchmark model which incorporates all the predefined relevant hydrological processes. FlexC is semi-distributed and distinguishes three different HRUs (hydrological response units), which are entities that show similar hydrological responses. We use two objective parameters to classify the area: Head Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) (as function of the flow accumulation) and hill slope values. FlexC’s HRUs are: Wetlands (with saturated overland flow and exfiltration of deeper groundwater), Inselbergs (with perennial baseflow from its large groundwater storages, fast runoff processes due to steep, forested and/or rocky slopes) and Flatlands. The latter covers a wider scope from irrigated areas, grass and shrub lands to rain-fed fields, but contributes also (delayed) to base and peak flows. Every HRU has its own slow groundwater response reservoir. Furthermore, we applied altitude corrected precipitation to correct for orographic effects. Both FlexA and FlexC are calibrated on the River Godi and validated on the RiverMessica. FlexC showed that (2) Messica’s Inselberg ridge most likely contains an over-year storage. It predicted a groundwater storage of about 800 mm in 2013 - 2014. This led to a specific discharge q of 1. 45 mm/s {{at the beginning of the}} dry period. In general, this storage guarantees a continuous streamflow during the dry season and makes the area more resilient for dry years. Moreover, we showed with FlexA and FlexC that (3) conveyances can be used to calibrate year-round discharge variations (both base and peak flows). It also proved that FlexModels are transferable, i. e. discharge variations for the (ungauged) downstream locations (Messica Downstream Station) can be predicted based on calibration on a (gauged) subcatchment (Godi Downstream Station). Where FlexA showed better peak flow predictions according to objective functions, FlexC narrowed down uncertainty intervals around predictions on other locations and gave a more consistent model performance. Given the smaller uncertainty intervals, the landscape dependent FlexC is better transferable than the lumped FlexA. However, FlexC seemed to overestimate peak flows, for which several explanations and improvements are given. In general, the conveyance method appeared accurate to predict baseflow recession and to calibrate on low flows. It performed less well during peak flows, since the uniform flow assumption was violated. This was mostly due to the abundant (water) vegetation. The vegetation was even denser above the average water level. Additional work is needed in order to make the method fully functional for the whole flow regime.
