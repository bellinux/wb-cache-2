40|$|The {{application}} of program transformations and refactorings involves {{the risk of}} capturing variables, which may break the intended semantics of the transformed code. One way to resolve variable capture is by renaming of the involved identifiers. However, in a modular context, the renaming of exported declarations is undesirable (affecting a module’s clients), and the renaming of <b>imported</b> <b>declarations</b> is impos-sible (requiring changes to third-party modules). We present an algorithm name-fix that detects and elimi-nates variable capture modularly. We extend a previous non-modular version of name-fix in order to (i) minimize re-namings of exported declarations, (ii) propagate necessary renamings of exported declarations to clients, and (iii) avoid renamings of <b>imported</b> <b>declarations</b> altogether. Together with support for transitive name bindings and conflicting declara-tions, our extensions to name-fix enable the application to real-world languages that feature separate compilation. To demonstrate the applicability of name-fix, we use it to mod-ularly resolve variable capture for optimizations, refactorings, and desugarings of Lightweight Java...|$|R

Then, we show that relying on an information provider - a pre-shipment inspection company in our case - seems to increase tax enforcement. Results indicate that pre-shipment inspections significantly reduce observed discrepancies in trade statistics. In line with previous studies, we find that the semi-elasticity of evasion increases with the tax rate. Finally, estimates confirm that enforcement is product-varying.

40|$|Indonesia is {{a country}} where most of its people rely on the {{agricultural}} sector as a livelihood. Indonesia's rice production is so high {{that it can not}} meet the needs of its population, consequently Indonesia still has to import rice from other food producing countries. One of the main causes is the enormous population. Statistics show that in the range of 230 - 237 million people, the staple food of all residents is rice so {{it is clear that the}} need for rice becomes very large. This study discusses the application of datamining on rice import by main country of origin using K-Means Clustering Method. Sources of data of this study were collected based on import <b>import</b> <b>declaration</b> documents produced by the Directorate General of Customs and Excise. In addition since 2015, import data also comes from PT. Pos Indonesia, records of other agencies at the border, and the results of cross-border maritime trade surveys. The data used in this study is the data of rice imports by country of origin from 2000 - 2015 consisting of 10 countries namely Vietnam, Thailand, China, India, Pakistan, United States, Taiwan, Singapore, Myanmar and Others. Variable used (1) total import of rice (net) and (2) import purchase value (CIF). The data will be processed by clustering rice imports by main country of origin in 3 clusters ie high imported cluster, medium imported cluster and low import level cluster. The clustering method used in this research is K-Means method.

40|$|The {{research}} of the thesis primary focused {{on the effectiveness of}} law No. 10 / 1995 about Customs to stengthen Customs function in Indonesia. As national law product, the new customs law has specific things which are not covered by previous customs law determined by Netherland Colonial Government and Material Penal Provisions (KUHP) and Formai Penal Provisions (KUHAP). Based on the above reason, the matter lodged in this research is how effective Las No. 10 / 1995 on law perception and to accomodate national needs, matter of objection and appeals, as customs law enforcer, the expeditious flow of goods process, also customs duty income. To solve and describe the above matter the research using normative juridical approach and completed with sociological approach and quantitative analysis. Therefore, the research besides observed law in books also observed law as law in action. The discoveries of the research are : The effectiveness of law No. 10 / 1995 may look by the outcome of law produd, i. e. three previous customs law become one customs law which based the phyiosophies on Pancasila and UUD 1945. The outcome of the quality/effectiveness of the product of Law No. 10 / 1995 may look by the successful' to make a) the smoothness of the flow of goods by seff assessment system, application of selective examination, also release of goods is not tied to payment process. b) the smoothness of customs declaration whether export declaration or- <b>import</b> <b>declaration</b> by the provisions of Law No. 10 / 1995. Besides lodgment of customs declaration by form, also lodgment of Customs declaration by disket or via electronic data interchange. So the effectiveness may look by the time needed for the process. c) the using of high technology container X-ray for physically inspections. The effectiveness of special programme to reach certain outcome may outlook by the using of profiling, targeting, verification and auditing, so the control system focused on investigating of book keeping and Wing of documents and correspondence concerning imports and exports. Thing which can not be ignored is possibility of argue. In this matter, the users of customs services are provided With rights to file objections, appeals against decisions made by the customs officials. The objections and the appeals besides regulated in provisions of national law also regulated in statements or agreement which conducted by several nations such as ASEAN Agreement on Customs, ASEAN Customs Vision 2020 Vision Statement also International Convention on the simplification and harmonization of customs procedures. The argue which can not be ignored needs fair solution which needs fast, cheap and simply process and procedure. The effectiveness of law enforcement also covered by Law No. 10 / 1995 which include administrative sanction for the violation of customs administration by fine punishment which the amount of flne ang things of violation written inarticles of Law No. 10 / 1995 also the violation of customs penal provisions which are fiscal violations described dearly in Law No, 10 / 1995. Specificaly, Law No. 10 / 1995 regulated different things such as : concerning formai penal : 1) 	Penal threat against trial is equal to final penal. 2) 	Imprison punish ment subtitute by fine penalty in case of criminal prosecution is directed to a legal person as written in article 108 La No. 10 / 1995. 3) 	The fine which is not paid by the sentence, asset and/or eaming of the sentence shall be taken as the subtitute, as written In article 110 paragraph 1 Customs Law. 4) 	Expiration of the law suft as regulated in article 111 customs law. Things related with formal penal are : 1) 	The termination of the investigation for the state revenue purposes is written in article 113 2) 	Passing on the result of the investigation (SPDP) to general Prosecutor as written in article 112 paragraph 3 Customs Law 3) 	Execution for confiscation of goods for the state written in article 109 Customs Law All of things described above besides effected to more effective of law inforcement also state fast services, cheap and simple related to formal penal and considering with Lex Specielis Derogate Lex Generalis. The effectiveness to reach fundamental goal accomadated in law. No. 10 / 1995, as protection function for domestic industries by a) giving facilities of exemption/suspended for customs duty and tax of imported goods of raw material and support material to produce exported goods. b. protection domestic industries from material injury cause of dumping and subsidy practice of exported goods which imported to Indonesia, to the goods will be applied Anti Dumping dities and Countervailing duties. 	Law No. 10 / 1995 about customs has separation of sub systems of imported goods clearance process, revenue collection process, control princip. The three things are separated to warrant the expeditous flow of goods so there is no high cost economy that customs user paid as the wish. The high cost economy may be avoided by Directorate General of Customs and Excise together with Customs Services Users. Concerning the above reason, Directorate General of Customs and Excise may acts one of customs functions as trade facilitator which may smoother the flow of goods. 	Directorate General of Customs and Excise has one of its functions as to prevent violation against customs law and take action on goods in performing the task by virtue of customs law and investigate an offence against customs law. Another law enforcement which Is new authority Is tax collection implemented with "Surat Paksaw regulated by Law No. 19 / 1997 Activities of dity collection by Directorate General of Customs and Excise is the implementation one of primary tasks of Directorate General of Customs and Excise i. e.

40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, customs {{authorities}} {{in many developing countries}} have introduced modern risk management techniques relying on data mining and statistical scoring techniques. By demonstrating that risk analysis in customs may be a valuable tool to facilitate legal trade and combat fraud more effectively, these techniques have helped improving the performance of customs authorities. However, these risk management techniques may prove to be inefficient in a context of moral hazard and low-performance customs administration. One way to address this weakness is to rely on information gained from discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics. The analysis of discrepancies in bilateral trade statistics (or mirror analysis) is increasingly used to identify high-risk import operations and to estimate revenue losses. By comparing data on fraud recorded by the Gabon customs administration with discrepancies in Gabon’s bilateral trade data, this paper highlights the benefits for a customs administration of a joint analysis of fraud records and mirror trade statistics data, the latter being indicative of the fraud remaining to be detected. Such an analysis helps customs to target ex post audits on risky <b>import</b> <b>declarations</b> unadjusted by the frontline customs officer. Finally, we point that analyzing jointly data on fraud records and mirror trade statistics data may be useful to (i) identify imported products for which the fraud remaining to be detected is large and (ii) monitor the performance of customs inspections...|$|R
40|$|Because {{food fraud}} can harm {{human health and}} erode {{consumer}} trust, {{it is imperative that}} it is detected at an early stage. Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} predict the expected food fraud type for imported products for which the product category and country of origin are known in order to target enforcement activities. For this purpose we used a Bayesian Network (BN) model that was developed based on adulteration/fraud notifications as reported in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) in the period 2000 – 2013. In this period 749 food fraud notifications were reported and were categorised in 6 different fraud types (i) improper, fraudulent, missing or absent health certificates, (ii) illegal importation, (iii) tampering, (iv) improper, expired, fraudulent or missing common entry documents or <b>import</b> <b>declarations,</b> (v) expiration date, (vi) mislabelling. The data were then used to develop a BN model. The constructed BN model was validated using 88 food fraud notifications reported in RASFF in 2014. The proposed model predicted 80 % of food fraud types correctly when food fraud type, country and food category had been reported previously in RASFF. The model predicted 52 % of all 88 food fraud types correctly when the country of origin or the product-country combination had not been recorded before in the RASFF database. The presented model can aid the risk manager/controller in border inspection posts in deciding which fraud type to check when importing products...|$|R
40|$|Millions {{of marine}} {{ornamental}} fishes are traded every year. Today, {{over half of}} the known nearly 4000 coral reef fish species are in trade with poor or no monitoring and demand is increasing. This study investigates their trade into and through Switzerland by analyzing import documents for live animals. In 2009, 151 <b>import</b> <b>declarations</b> with attached species lists for marine ornamental fishes from non-EU countries totaled 28   356 specimens. The 62 % of the fishes remaining in Switzerland, comprised 440 marine species from 45 families, the rest transited to EU and non-EU countries. Despite the recognized large trade volume for the European region, due to bilateral agreements, no data is collected for imports from the EU. However, inferred data shows that more than 200   000 marine ornamental fishes could be imported into Switzerland every year and an unknown quantity re-exported. As biggest import region, it is therefore safe to assume, that the European region is importing at least as many marine ornamental fishes as the US. There is no adequate data-collecting system known to be in place in any country for monitoring this trade. The EU Trade Control and Expert System (TRACES) to monitor animal diseases could be adjusted to gather compulsory information for the EU and Switzerland. More than half of the species imported into Switzerland are not assessed by the IUCN and therefore marked as ‘not evaluated’ on the Red List. Overall, 70 % of all known coral reef fish species have not been evaluated.

He {{said that the}} MOEA will ensure that the GMP is a guarantee for safety, and without it consumers will be exposed more to unsafe foods.|$|R

The hunger strike was supported by 37 organisations and political parties. Manser only stopped the hunger strike after his mother requested that he do so. After Manser's disappearance, the Swiss parliament finally adopted the Declaration of Timber Products on 1 October 2010, with a transition period allowed until the end 2011.|$|R

The department enforces licensing control on rice and consumer protection legislation relating to weights and measures, markings on fineness of precious metals, and safety of toys, children's products and consumer goods. The department also verifies <b>import</b> and export <b>declarations</b> to ensure accurate trade statistics and assesses and collects declaration charges and the clothing industry training levy.|$|R

He said that currently the bureau is reviewing the GMD system and might require manufacturers to present its export and <b>import</b> activities and <b>declaration</b> and to allow on-the-spot inspection of their production lines when seeking certification.|$|R
40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{optimization model}} {{was developed to}} determine optimal testing strategies, costs, and risks of a dual marketing system. The model chooses the testing strategy (application, intensity, and tolerance) that maximizes utility (minimizes disutility) of additional system costs due to testing and quality loss and allows simulation of the risk premium required to induce grain handlers to undertake a dual marketing system versus a Non-GM system. Cost elements including those related to testing, quality loss, and a risk premium were estimated for a model representing a grain export chain. Uncertainties were incorporated and include test accuracy, risk of adventitious commingling throughout, and variety declaration. Sensitivities were performed for effects of variety risks, penalty differentials, re-elevation discounts, <b>import</b> tolerances, variety <b>declaration,</b> risk aversion, GM adoption, and domestic end-user.

40|$|A {{growing number}} of {{countries}} are adopting e-government to deliver greater operational efficiency, cost savings and transparency. The current wave of globalization and {{the integration of the}} world economy have intensified international trade volumes. Thus, the prospect of development through trade has driven some countries sub-Saharan Africa to adopt information and communication technologies (ICTs), particularly electronic data interchange (EDI) to facilitate international trade. This paper applies Amartya Sen’s Capability Approach (CA) as a framework to examine the effect of an e-government initiative intended to modernise customs operational procedures and facilitate trade. E-trade facilitation has given individuals and businesses the opportunity to lodge <b>import</b> and exports <b>declarations</b> electronically with a single document, resulting in time and cost savings as declarations can be made electronically from any location and at any time. The paper makes a contribution by offering a useful example of the affordances of the CA for examining e-government initiatives particularly in developing countries focusing on what people can actually do with the opportunities provided by e-government, rather than using income-based measures...|$|R
2500|$|The {{devastation of}} the war did bring a silver lining. In 1919, the French {{government}} passed a series of laws that would {{lay the groundwork for}} the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) system that would strictly define winemaking laws and regional boundaries. Measures were taken to eliminate fraud and illegal additives such as rhubarb and apple juice. Only grapes grown from the delineated Champagne region, which would eventually include the Aube, could be legally called [...] "Champagne". The decimation of the region's vineyards provided the opportunity for vine growers to replant with phylloxera resistant rootstock and in more ideal locations for quality grape production. But amidst this silver lining, more dark clouds would emerge as the full effects of the Russian Revolution hit home and the lucrative Russian market was closed to Champagne <b>imports.</b> The 1920 <b>declaration</b> of prohibition in the United States closed off yet another market and the global economic downturn of the Great Depression lead to a further decrease in sales. World War II would bring more troops marching through the vineyards of Champagne. While the devastation brought to the region was not as severe as the previous war, World War II was still a troubling time for the region. It was in Reims, on May 7, 1945 that the German military commander Alfred Jodl offered an unconditional surrender to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower. The following morning, the signing was celebrated with 6 cases of the 1934 vintage of Pommery. Wine historians Don and Petie Kladstrup noted that a World War II historian would later comment that [...] "the last explosions {{of the war}} were the popping of Champagne corks".|$|R
