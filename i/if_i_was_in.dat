5|$|The {{first song}} {{came on and}} I just stood up and I kind of walked {{into the other room}} as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a tractor beam and stood there in front of the stereo. It was just as {{powerful}} as the electric stuff, and it was songs I'd grown up singing. All of a sudden I'd found my music.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante {{became friends}} with former Dead Kennedys drummer D. H. Peligro in early 1988. They often jammed together, and Peligro invited his friend Flea (bassist of Red Hot Chili Peppers) to join. Frusciante and Flea {{developed}} a musical chemistry immediately, with Flea later acknowledging {{that might have been}} the day he first played the bass riff to [...] "Nobody Weird Like Me". Around the same time, Frusciante intended to audition for Frank Zappa's band, but changed his mind before the final try-out as Zappa strictly prohibited illegal drug use. Frusciante said, [...] "I realized that I wanted to be a rock star, do drugs and get girls, and that I wouldn't be able to do that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Zappa's band." ...|$|E
500|$|Dark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it {{was then}} known, was {{performed}} in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 – {{more than a year before}} its release – at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as [...] "...bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning." [...] Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote [...] "The ambition of the Floyd's artistic intention is now vast." [...] Melody Maker was, however, less enthusiastic: [...] "Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a bird-cage at London zoo." [...] However, the following tour was praised by the public. The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences between the live version, and the recorded version released a year later, included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as [...] "On the Run", and Bible readings that were later replaced by Clare Torry's non-lexical vocables on [...] "The Great Gig in the Sky".|$|E
5000|$|... 28. Before criticizing somebody, I try {{to imagine}} how <b>I</b> would feel <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> their place.|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{the east}} now, I {{could stop the}} {{publication}} of a piratical book which has stolen some of my sketches.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I'll say anything!' cried Mr. Wickfield, with {{a desperate}} air. 'Why should <b>I</b> not <b>be</b> <b>in</b> all the world's power <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> yours?' ...|$|R
2500|$|At age 11, Parker {{took up the}} drums, {{just like}} his brother, and later was making [...] "excessively melodic music from {{about the age of}} 12 to 15", which was [...] "really weird and {{repetitive}} and almost genre-less", by recording his drumming and overdubbing guitar and other instruments in lo-fi experiments. Speaking about this Parker said [...] "I've always recorded music. When I was 12, I used to set up two tape machines and multi-track myself. First, I'd record a beat on the drums, then, I'd play that tape into another tape recorder while playing keyboard; then I'd take that tape and play bass guitar along with the drums and keyboard. I'd keep adding instruments. I did {{that for a long time}} until my dad bought me an 8-track, and then I continued recording music by myself, even <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> other bands at the same time." [...] This hobby turned into an obsession for Parker who was [...] "just doing music all the time, I never did any homework, I'd just spend every night in the garage recording music." [...] Parker got his first eight-track recorder at age 16.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it's all right, an' no {{harm done}} in my tellin' you; but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> your place I'd keep my eyes open pretty wide. Now, Jip Collins can't scare me a little bit; but yet <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a snap like this, an' I knew he'd {{threatened}} to set fire, it would kind er stir me up a bit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I would <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> your fix. Keep right close after me; they's some ditches here, and the foot-bridges {{are none}} too wide." ...|$|E
50|$|As for Greiffenhagen's 'Idyll', {{it moves}} me almost as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> love myself. Under its intoxication, I have flirted madly this Christmas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--no doubt. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the Cabinet myself I {{should not}} admit so much. There are reticences,--of course. And {{there is an}} {{official}} discretion." ...|$|R
60|$|C. I don't know. I hate it all; but <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{the midst}} of {{everything}} again, it might stifle the pain a little.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{suppose he}} cares one halfpenny about her frock," [...] said Nina. [...] "I should never {{think about a}} man's coat <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Those rascals {{attacked}} me!" [...] he muttered. [...] "They {{struck me}} over the head! I remember now! Oh, how my head spins,--just as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a merry-go-round! I wonder----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, y'better {{be doing}} {{something}} besides standing here, 'r y' 'll freeze t' death. I'd {{go over to the}} Arteeshun House an' go t' bed <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> your fix." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can {{appreciate}} how you feel. I'd {{be the same}} way, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> your place, Dave," [...] was the kindly answer of the senator's son.|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{not asking}} the favor!" [...] Beatrice urged in desperation. [...] "The debt is not mine! It would <b>be</b> {{different}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> Gerald's place." ...|$|R
5000|$|At his {{sentencing}} in April, Krajcir stated, [...] "I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> {{could have}} <b>been</b> so generous <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the same situation. Thank you for sparing my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say for Mr. Hingston," [...] Redfield returned. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> {{his place}} I'd {{want to keep}} my jug out of sight when you fellows were on duty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, as it seemed, {{the heavens}} and the earth rushed back upon me. I saw the people near staring in {{surprise}} at me, and wondering <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> my right mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, y' {{better be}} doing {{something}} besides standing here, 'r y' 'll freeze t' death. I'd {{go over to the}} Arteeshun House an' go t' bed <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> your fix." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ha! ha!' said Sir Ratcliffe. 'But Armine is {{not like}} Grandison. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> the old preserves, you should have no cause to jeer at my sportsmanship.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, if {{you choose}} to call it fickle. I don't know that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> fickle. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> love with a girl <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> true to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, young gentlemen, {{you seem}} to have thought of everything. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> command of a ship, I should like to have you all as midshipmen." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes; I {{understand}} it all. But {{there are times}} when I feel bitterly the necessity of remaining in hiding, as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> fact a criminal. Have you any more news?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ah;--he {{did that}} in his anger. By George, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> his {{position}} I should try and raise the very devil. But don't talk of giving him money, George. He's not bad in that way.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can’t {{get into}} trouble by doing as I tell you," [...] said the shoemaker, impatiently. [...] "However, to be quite on the safe side, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> your place I should lose the key." ...|$|E
6000|$|Alton's {{eyes were}} wistful. [...] "No. Do you know, {{this place has}} quite an effect on me. It makes me feel--as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> church," [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{his place}} <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> {{determined}} also. You {{may as well}} give it up. Not but that I like Owen a thousand times the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|Deane {{looked at}} her wonderingly. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "let me congratulate you. You play the game to perfection. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a {{position}} to make terms--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will perhaps {{serve for}} such," [...] said I, [...] "that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a jesting humour--which {{is far from}} the case--I believe I might lay a claim on your lordship for two hundred pounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, {{and good}} luck to you," [...] Osip replied. [...] "I would go with you <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> for life; but I have lost two years already by running away, and I dare not try again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no! I guess I betta not. 'Twouldn't do you any good. I guess I won't say {{anything}} moa. But <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> youa place, and I {{really wanted to}} know whe'e them slippas come from--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you going}} to do nothing? Aren't {{you going to}} try and free yourself? <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> your position, <b>I</b> would never rest till I'd made them free me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps; {{but not as}} <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{the house}} and at the wedding. It would just bring back the time when she bade me never give up my sword." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't, <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> your place. It {{would be}} a fearful business; there hasn't been a boy {{expelled}} from Westminster for the last thirty years. I shouldn't stop for it <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> you." ...|$|R
