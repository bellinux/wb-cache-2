30|$|The {{presence}} of a sort of inorganic <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> under the carbon black film is remarkable. In fact, there are no historical references {{on the use of}} a <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> under the decorations, in contrast with the varnish of musical instruments, where the {{presence of}} an inorganic <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> is well known, especially during the 17 th century, e.g. in many Stradivari’s violins [16]. Following the opinion of many authors, as Sacconi quoted [17], the surface treatment of many string instruments of the so called classical period of Italian luthery (16 th and 17 th centuries) is a composite coating with at least two main distinct layers: the outer layer, composed of various varnish coats, is strongly colored and henceforth it can be called color varnish; the inner one is denoted as the <b>ground</b> <b>layer,</b> and is often identified as a hard, durable and insoluble material with good optical properties. According to recent studies and investigations based mainly on SEM-EDX techniques, the principal component of the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> of black decorations is a mineral micro- or even nanometric particulate with an organic binder.|$|R
30|$|The ancient Chinese {{architectural}} {{paintings in}} North China almost {{always have a}} <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> as the very bottom layer. (By contrast, those in South China sometimes {{do not have a}} <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> [7]). The preparation of a <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> in architectural paintings clearly originates from ancient Chinese wall painting manufacturing techniques. It was done for several purposes, including (but not necessarily limited to): to produce a smooth surface upon which paint layers can be easily applied; to serve as a support for paint layers and prevent them from cracking; and to allow absorption of liquids (such as oil and water) from the paint layers and therefore produce better visual effects in paintings [8]. The preparation of a <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> for architectural paintings, just as done for wall paintings, usually cannot be accomplished all at once. It involves several rounds of repeating steps (using the same or different materials) and results in tightly overlapped layers. Due to the difference (or similarity) in materials (such as fibers and coating pigments) used in each round of coating, the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> can (or cannot) be further divided into sublayers. Sometimes, even different parts of the same <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> differ in the number of subdivisible layers. Our observations on cross sections of golden dragon Hexi painting fragments suggest that Hexi painting has a <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> that makes a distinction between two layers with completely different base materials: a fiber (organic) layer and a coat (inorganic) layer upon it, the latter of which often is further divisible.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} resolve the {{parasitic}} capacitance by the air bubbles between the PI substrate and copper tape, the transmission line with the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> of the silver paste is additionally fabricated, as shown in Fig.  3 c. The dimension and material property of the transmission line is same to transmission line # 2 except {{for the length of}} transmission line, as shown in Table  1. The length is 91  mm, which is transmission line with the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> of silver paste. Although the transmission line for the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> of copper tape and silver paste were fabricated with different length, however the loss was measured and calculated per unit length to compare the proposed transmission lines. Figure  4 c shows the RF performance of transmission lines with <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> using the copper tape and silver paste. The transmission loss is measured to be 0.22 and 0.32  dB/cm at 1  GHz, respectively. Although the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> of silver paste is used for improvement of RF performance, transmission loss is increase than previous transmission line because the silver paste has the lower conductivity than copper tape. Consequently, the results show that the conductivity of ground is important factor at RF performance of transmission line.|$|R
40|$|Andropogon gayanus (gamba grass) is an {{introduced}} pasture {{grass that}} threatens Australia’s tropical savannas by modifying fire regimes and species composition. To understand the establishment requirements of A. gayanus, we undertook a field experiment {{to determine the}} effect of canopy cover and <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> disturbance on seedling emergence and survival. Seed was sown under three canopy treatments (undisturbed, artificial canopy gap, and natural canopy gap) and under three <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> treatments (Control, Vegetation disturbed, and Soil disturbed). Results have shown that A. gayanus can establish and survive regardless of canopy cover or ground disturbance, although such site disturbances will increase establishment success. Disturbance of both the overstorey canopy and the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> increased A. gayanus emergence, whereas seedling survival to 12 mo after seed sowing was affected by <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> disturbance alone. Disturbance of the canopy increased light transmission, which may have promoted germination. <b>Ground</b> <b>layer</b> disturbance may also have increased light transmission and suitable sites for establishment, and reduced competition for resources, such as water and nutrients. The ability of A. gayanus to spread along disturbed areas, establish in relatively undisturbed savannas, and resprout after fire within 6 mo after seedling emergence suggests that this species will become increasingly widespread in Australia’s tropical savannas.

40|$|Abstract Background Wildfires are an {{increasingly}} {{important component of the}} forces that drive the global carbon (C) cycle and climate change as progressive warming is expected in boreal areas. This study estimated C emissions from the wildfires across the Alaskan Yukon River Basin in 2004. We spatially related the firescars to land cover types and defined the C fractions of aboveground biomass and the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> (referring to the top 15 cm organic soil layer only in this paper) consumed in association with land cover types, soil drainage classes, and the C stocks in the <b>ground</b> <b>layer.</b> Results The fires led to a burned area of 26, 500 km 2 and resulted in the total C emission of 81. 1 ± 13. 6 Tg (Tg, Teragram; 1 Tg = 10 12 g) or 3. 1 ± 0. 7 kg C m - 2 burned. Of the total C emission, about 73 % and 27 % could be attributed to the consumption of the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> and aboveground biomass, respectively. Conclusion The predominant contribution of the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> to the total C emission implies the importance of ground fuel management to the control of wildfires and mitigation of C emissions. The magnitude of the total C emission depends on fire extent, while the C loss in kg C m - 2 burned is affected strongly by the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> and soil drainage condition. The significant reduction in the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> by large fires may result in profound impacts on boreal ecosystem services with an increase in feedbacks between wildfires and climate change. </p...|$|R

40|$|Peatland <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> species {{composition}} is intri-cately tied to ecosystem function (for example, carbon storage). As the primary disturbance in boreal bogs, wildfire selectively removes the <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> vegetation, creating heterogeneous habitat conditions and initiating succession. How-ever, the successional {{trajectory of the}} <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> community following fire is poorly understood. Here we assess spatial and temporal changes in community composition along a chronosequence of post-fire bogs (1 – 105 years since fire) in north central Alberta, Canada. We established vegetation plots in 13 bogs and repeatedly monitored them from 2003 – 2006. We found three phases of the post-fire bog community, grading from pioneer true moss (for example, Polytrichum strictum) dom-inance soon post-fire ( 80 ysf). Mature bogs dominated by Sphagnum fuscum had the greatest species richness, although species evenness was low. Spatial heterogeneity of <b>ground</b> <b>layer</b> community composition was bimodal, peak-ing approximately 10 ysf (co-occurrence of true mosses and Sphagnum) and more than 80 ysf when feathermosses encroach and break-up Sphagnum dominance, resulting in inverse relationships of community species richness and diversity along the post-fire recovery gradient. Based on these results, we develop a conceptual model of post-fire bog recolonization and succession, in which microto-pography, soil moisture, and combustion severity interact, thereby presenting the first comprehen-sive description of the spatio-temporal post-fire successional trajectory of the bog <b>ground</b> <b>layer.</b> Key words: succession; peatland; fire; commu-nity; ecosystem; bog; trajectory analysis; interme-diate disturbance hypothesis; non-metric multidimensional scaling...|$|R
