5000|$|Stephen Balzer immigrated in the 1870s {{from the}} Kingdom of Hungary to the USA. He apprenticed as a watchmaker at Tiffany's.

In the same year, he completed his first prototype automobile, a motorized quadricyclewith a tube chassis, less than 6 ft long and 3 ft wide. It had a rotary, air-cooled, 3-cylinder engine, mounted vertically in the rear and revolving around a fixed crankshaft. Turning with the crank case was a stub shaft.

50|$|Trixie, Racer X, Sparky's son, Jennifer, Spritle, Chim-Chim, and the now {{captured}} Sparky, quickly {{escape from}} the containment bay and plan another assault on Leland Industries. Trixie calls Speed and tells him to join the attack, but he refuses. 100 miles from the finish, he makes his move to take first place, but in the struggle drives the Mach 5 Ultra off the track, plummeting into a pool. A 92 year-old Pops Racer rushes out from the sidelines to his son's rescue, activating the time orb and sending the Mach 5 Ultra back {{in the past and}} in the race. While talking to his father, Speed realizes that he can't just go back to the past and hope to prevent this future. Activating the Mach 5 Ultra's new hover functionality, he flies out of the stadium to rally nearby humans into confronting Leland. Leland then gets into his own jet to <b>engage</b> <b>Speed.</b> With the office empty, Sparky and his son try to shutdown the invasion plan while Trixie, Racer X and Jennifer mount a ground assault against the robots.|$|R
30|$|The {{potential}} benefits of using rewards are clear when considering how individuals decide to <b>engage</b> in <b>speeding.</b> As a rule, a full cost-benefit analysis rarely precedes individual decision making, especially given the immediacy in which decisions are made while driving [31]. Rather, individuals make use of cognitive aids and shortcuts such as heuristics. Studies have shown that particular constellations of rewards can influence decision making beyond their objective value in a cost-benefit analysis [13]. Accordingly, the use of rewards may be particularly beneficial to motivate behavioral change.|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{utilisation}} of the Manchester Driving Behaviour Questionnaire (DBQ) and the Driving Attitude Questionnaire (DAQ) to examine the self-reported aberrant driving behaviours and safety attitudes of a sample of Australian fleet drivers (N = 443). Surveys were posted to drivers who {{agreed to participate in}} the study. Univariate analyses of the subscales revealed that participants were least concerned about speeding, followed by risky overtaking manoeuvres, while attitudes regarding the seriousness of close following and drink driving were significantly higher. In regards to behaviours, participants were most likely to report <b>engaging</b> in <b>speeding</b> and aggressive violations, and least likely to report making driving errors. Importantly, additional bi-variate analyses revealed that individuals who <b>engaged</b> in regular <b>speeding</b> behaviours and reported risky overtaking manoeuvres were most likely to incur demerit point losses. The results indicate that fleet interventions designed to improve road safety may benefit from focusing on attempting to reduce speeding infringements and the possible "speeding culture" that may exist within the fleet industry. This paper will further outline the major findings of the study, highlight the limitations and provide direction for future fleet safety research...|$|R

50|$|The impetus is to {{minimize}} overdrive use {{and provide a}} higher ratio first gear, which means more gears {{between the first and}} the last to keep the engine at its most efficient speed. This {{is part of the reason}} that modern automobiles tend to have larger numbers of gears in their transmissions. It is also why more than one overdrive gear is seldom seen in a vehicle except in special circumstances i.e. where high (numerical) differential gear is required to get the vehicle moving as in trucks or performance cars though double overdrive transmissions are common in other vehicles, often with a small number on the axle gear reduction, but usually only <b>engage</b> at <b>speeds</b> exceeding 100 km/h.|$|R

30|$|We found a {{significant}} correlation between self-reporting on the tendency to <b>engage</b> in <b>speeding</b> and the objective measures acquired using Get Location.

At the same time the ease at which participants used the application suggests that existing technological platforms have already created self-monitoring services that are in wide use. Thus, research the same type of methodology could be used to better understand driving behavior at the individual level.|$|R
