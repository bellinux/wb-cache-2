40|$|In East Kalimantan (Indonesia), {{impacts of}} {{conventional}} and reduced-impact logging (RIL) on forest ecosystems were compared {{on the basis}} of pre- and post-harvesting stand inventories. There was a positive and significant correlation between the proportion of trees damaged by felling and the density of trees felled. Logging intensity ranged from 1 to 17 trees ha- (9 [...] 247 m 3 ha- 1) and averaged 9 trees ha- 1 (86. 9 m 3 ha- 1). The study has shown that with RIL techniques, logging damage on the original stand can be significantly reduced by 50 % compared with conventional logging. However, this 50 % reduction in logging damage, was dependent on the felling intensity. With a felling intensity of 8 stems ha- 1 or less, RIL techniques only damaged 25 % of the original tree population whereas 48 % were damaged with conventional techniques. Above this felling intensity (i. e. 8 stems ha- 1), the effectiveness of RIL in limiting forest damage was significantly reduced, mainly because of the increasing felling damage. Moreover, the removal of all harvestable timber trees, leaving only few potential crop trees, will result in a seriously depleted residual stand. Because of the high damage involved by high felling intensity, leaving few potential crop trees, and the yield capacity of the remaining stand, acceptable harvesting volume will not be reached within the <b>felling</b> <b>rotation</b> of 35 years. It is concluded that silvicultural system based on diameter limit alone, as is the Indonesian system (TPTI), cannot be compatible with sustainability and more sophisticated harvested-selection rules are needed...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{planning}} {{is the most}} important condition for sustainable, continuous, economically efficient and ecological forest use. In North-West Russia, in the Komi Republic in particular, the increasing role of forest {{planning is}} based on the obvious need to transfer from the extensive way of forest management and use of primary natural forests to intensive way of secondary reforestated forests management and use. Forest planning in these conditions should provide the required demand in timber under conditions of forest ecological and social importance protection, taking into account the existed spatial structure of the forest fund. Landscape, ecological and economical forest evaluation as a basis for forest planning allows to define secondary forest areas where efficient forestry and economically profitable activities are possible (taking in consideration the pattern structure and spatial heterogeneity of secondary forests, where most of the territory is covered with low-value stands). Forest planning in intensive forestry should be long-term, minimum for one <b>felling</b> <b>rotation</b> period. This requires to work out regional research programmes for forest activities, but allows giving the economical estimation at each stage of forest management, not only by the felling time. Forest planning allows to estimate the costs of forestry activities and to relate to the expected results that are really important for the financial and economical planning at the enterprise. Long-term forest planning guarantees not only economical efficiency, but makes the grounds for forest social and ecological values protection. Forest planning process is dealing with the necessity of various data collection and joint use. Besides forest inventory data, forest planning includes remote sensing data that can guarantee acute and updated information about a certain forest area, allows to specify spatial, age and tree species structure of a forest stand, define a landscape and ecological peculiarities of the planning object, mark high value forests and key biotopes. Modern information technologies based on GIS provide the tools for the complex analysis of information about forests and give opportunities to modeling of expected results and give an opportunity for forest planning to select the optimal way of forest management for a certain place...|$|E

40|$|Stand {{treatment}} prescriptions in Lithuania {{are based}} on silvicultural traditions and biometric models, whereas application of economic models still is in its very infancy. The forest yield model of Kuliesis, pine assortment tables, observed timber prices, and costs of silvicultural treatments constitute sufficient information for optimizing silvicultural regimes in pine stands, using economic criteria, namely, forest rent, net present value, and soil expectation value. The dynamic programming approach enables simultaneous optimisation of intermediate and final <b>felling</b> throughout the <b>rotation.</b> Results obtained confirm that rotation ages differ according to site productivity. Optimal rotations range from 80 years in most productive stands to over 130 on the poorest sites, when the forest rent criterion is selected. The choice of thinning regimes is less obvious due to high sensitivity to timber prices, interest rates, and other factors...|$|R

To complete the trade, the Yankees sent Bill Miller, Kal Segrist, Don Leppert, and Ted Del Guercio to the Orioles, and the Orioles sent Mike Blyzka, Darrell Johnson, Jim Fridley and Dick Kryhoski to the Yankees. Comprising 17 players, this trade remains the largest in MLB history.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{transfer}} matrix method (TMM) for rotors with multiple coupler offsets was derived. The studies showed the coupler’s stiffness altered the rotor’s critical speeds but offset caused additional external excitation. The cases of two offsets in- and anti-phase in a typical rotor were given as examples. In the in-phase case, significantly increased response amplitude occurred at lower rotational speed and the increase was linearly proportional to the offset value. As to the anti-phase case, the increased response was insignificant, implying an opposite offset would cancel out a major response of the previous offset. The whirling orbits {{before and after the}} offset couplers were also illustrated. The results, as expected, showed the in-phase offset displayed much larger radii than the anti-phase’s. The rotor’s orbits changed the whirling direction once the <b>rotation</b> <b>fell</b> within a certain range and this feature seemed to be unaffected by coupler offsets...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a general {{transfer}} matrix method (TMM) for rotors containing global and local coupler offset was derived. Rotor response due to imbalances and offsets are then studied via the developed method. The studies showed both global and local offsets played as an external excitation that is a combined effect of all the elements behind the offset. Differences between global offset and local offset were compared and the results showed both types basically retain the same mode patterns but different jumps at the offset. The global offset, yet, imposed more significant dynamic effects since all the offsets accumulate thereafter. The whirling orbits in front and behind the offset were illustrated as well. The results, as expected, showed global offset appeared much larger radii especially after offset. The rotor's whirling orientation reversed, as <b>rotation</b> <b>fell</b> within a certain range and this feature was not changed by offsets. The TMM proposed by this study can be well applied to multiple global and local offsets...|$|R

40|$|An object {{rotating}} {{in depth}} presents a coherent sequence of views but each view is seen only briefly. This scenario raises two questions {{addressed in the}} present study: (1) Do observers encode {{the dynamics of the}} motion sequence or only the discrete views that comprise the sequence? (2) If motion dynamics are encoded, how do they affect recognition? Observers viewed a movie of an object rotating in depth (study) followed by a static frame showing a single view (test) and judged whether study and test showed the same or different objects. We also manipulated the diagnosticity of the shape information present in the stimulus set and where the test view <b>fell</b> along the <b>rotation</b> trajectory implied by the movie (preceding, early, middle, late, following — all equally spaced). We found that: (1) test frames that followed the trajectory of the motion sequence were better recognized than test frames that preceded the motion sequence; (2) test frames that were actually seen in the sequence were better recognized than following test frames; (3) test frames {{from the end of the}} sequence were better recognized than frames from the middle or early part of the sequence. We conclude that observers are biased to encode or remember views that occur near the end of an implied motion trajectory. Moreover, observers use dynamic information to predict unseen views of an object that are consistent with the implied direction of motion. Interestingly, a similar pattern across test conditions was observed for both same and different object trials, suggesting that information encoded about object dynamics is not limited to the particular object being viewed, but instead generalizes to visually-similar objects...|$|R
40|$|Eucalyptus globulus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} pulpwood plantation species in the world, and nowadays it is present in most continents. Some of the regions where E. globulus plantations have been expanding have a high incidence of wildfires; therefore, knowing the factors affecting the fire resistance and resilience of this species is particularly important for forest management. This is the case of Portugal, where nearly 1. 4 million ha of land burned in the last decade and where E. globulus has become the most widespread tree species. In this paper we assessed the short-term post-fire responses of E. globulus trees in four sites affected by wildfires, and investigated their potential relationships with fire severity descriptors and with tree and stand characteristics. One year after fire, individual tree mortality was low (3. 9 %) but most trees (79. 2 %) were top-killed (i. e. had stem mortality). Both post-fire tree mortality and top-kill increased with fire severity (expressed by maximum char height and/or char severity rating). Moreover, top-kill was positively related with vegetation cover and the proportion of pine trees in the stand, and was negatively related with tree diameter and the proportion of other broadleaved trees in the stand. The most common post-fire regeneration type among the sampled trees was basal resprouting (89. 2 %), though 20. 9 % had epicormic resprouting. The number of basal resprouts increased with char height, top-kill and diameter of the parent tree, and decreased with slope. In terms of post-fire growth, the height of the dominant resprout increased with the number of resprouts and with char severity, while it decreased in drier southern aspects. Results showed that E. globulus is a fire-resilient species with a very high probability of surviving fire; however, in forest plantations where trees are usually <b>felled</b> in short <b>rotations</b> (thus with limited size), individuals have a high probability of being top-killed. The presented models may be useful to help managers on the assessment of post-fire production losses and regeneration potential in E. globulus plantation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Aortic {{stenosis}} (AS) is {{the most}} common heart valve disease in Europe and North America. Age-related calcification of the valve is the commonest cause of acquired AS, especially in patients older than 70 years. Conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and the novel, minimally invasive transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), effectively preserve left ventricular (LV) function, relieve symptoms and improve survival in patients with severe symptomatic AS. However, patients with impaired LV function may carry significant operative risk, and long recovery time. In addition, such patients might have other comorbidities, and hence adding another challenge. Thus evaluation of ventricular function before and after AVR, as well as critical evaluation of TAVI patients should contribute to better clinical outcome. Methods: We studied LV function by conventional echocardiography before and after SAVR in the following groups; (I) 86 patients (aged 71 ± 10 years) with severe AS and LV dysfunction; (II) 112 consecutive elderly AS patients (aged 77 ± 2 years) and compared them with 72 younger patients (aged 60 ± 1 years); (III) 66 patients (age 70 ± 2 years, 53 male) who underwent AVR for severe AS with concurrent LV dysfunction; (IV) 89 consecutive patients with symptomatic severeAS who underwent successful TAVI, 45 of whom received trans-apical TAVI (TA) (age 80. 8 ± 4. 9 year, 26 male) and 44 trans-femoral TAVI (TF) (age 82. 9 ± 5. 8 year, 22 male). The conventional echocardiographic measurements were made according to the guidelines. Severe AS was identified by aortic valve mean pressure gradient > 40 mmHg or valve area < 1. 0 cm 2. LV systolic dysfunction was identified as ejection fraction (EF) < 50 %. LV long-axis function was presented by mitral annular plane systolic excursion (MAPSE) at lateral wall and septal wall, which were measured from apical four-chamber view. Also from the same view, LV septal and lateral wall deformation using STE as well as global longitudinal systolic strain. The LV systolic twist as the net difference between apical rotation and basal rotation was measured from the parasternal apical and basal short-axis views in the TAVI patients. Results: Study I: In the low flow and high gradient group, operative (30 -day) mortality was 10 %, and peri-operative mortality was associated with lower mean LVEF, higher mitral E:A ratio, peak systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PSPAP), and higher serum creatinine (all p< 0. 001), NYHA class III–IV, concomitant coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), urgent surgery, and longer bypass-time (all p< 0. 05). Mortality at 4 years was 17 %. Univariate predictors of 4 -year mortality were: lower EF (p< 0. 001), presence of restrictive LV filling (p< 0. 001), raised PSPAP (p< 0. 001) and CABG (p= 0. 037). However, only EF< 40 % (p= 0. 03), the presence of restrictive LV filling (p= 0. 033) and raised PSPAP (p< 0. 01) independently predicted mortality in this group. Study II: Elderly patients had higher NYHA class, more frequent atrial fibrillation (AF), coronary artery disease (CAD), emergency operation and use of bioprosthetic valves. They also had shorter E-wave deceleration time (DT) and larger left atria (LA) (p< 0. 05 for all). 30 -day mortality was 12 % vs 4 % (Log Rank x 2 = 3. 02, p= 0. 08) and long term mortality was 18 % vs 7 % (Log Rank x 2 = 4. 38,p= 0. 04) in the two groups, respectively. Age was not related to mortality after adjustment for other variables. Among all variables, anemia (OR 4. 20, CI: 1. 02 – 6. 86, p= 0. 04), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time (OR 1. 02, CI 1. 01 – 1. 04,p< 0. 01), significant patient prosthesis mismatch (PPM) (OR 5. 43, CI 1. 04 – 18. 40,p< 0. 05) were associated with 30 -day mortality in elderly patients. Their long-term mortality was related to CBP time (OR 1. 02, CI 1. 00 – 1. 05, p= 0. 04),PPM (OR 4. 64, CI 1. 33 – 16. 11, p= 0. 02) and raised LA pressure: DT (OR 0. 94, CI 0. 84 – 0. 99, p= 0. 03) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) (OR 1. 12, CI 1. 03 – 1. 19, p< 0. 001). STUDY III: Following SAVR peak aortic pressure gradient (AOPG) decreased and indexed valve area increased (64 ± 3 to 19 ± 1 mmHg and 0. 30 ± 0. 01 to 0. 89 ± 0. 03 cm 2 /m 2, p< 0. 001 for both). LVEF increased (from 45 ± 1 to 54 ± 2 %;p< 0. 001), LV end diastolic and end-systolic dimensions fell (LVEDD index: from 33 ± 1 to 30 ± 1 mm/m 2; and LVESD index: from 27 ± 1 to 20 ± 1 mm/m 2; (p< 0. 01 forboth). LV diastolic dysfunction improved as evidenced by the fall in E/A ratio (from 2. 6 ± 0. 2 to 1. 9 ± 0. 4) and prolongation of total filling time; (from 29. 2 ± 0. 6 to 31. 4 ± 0. 5 s/min, p= 0. 01 for both). Among all echocardiographic variables, LV dimensions (LVEDD index, OR 0. 70, CI 0. 52 – 0. 97, p< 0. 05; LVESD index, OR 0. 57, CI 0. 40 – 0. 85, p= 0. 005) were the two independent predictors of post-operative LV functional recovery on multivariate analysis. A cut-off value ofpre-operative LVESD index<= 27. 5 mm/m 2 was 85 % sensitive and 72 % specific inpredicting intermediate-term recovery of LV function after AVR (AUC, 0. 72, p= 0. 002). STUDY IV: Before TAVI, {{there was no difference between}} the two patient groups in gender, age, body surface area (BSA) and baseline LV function. However, left ventricular mass index (LVMi), left atrial volume index (LAVi) and tricuspid regurgitation pressure drop (TRPdrop) were increased in the TA group (p< 0. 05). One week after TAVI, aortic pressure gradient (AOPG) markedly dropped in thetwo groups (both p< 0. 001), LVEDD index and LVESD index fell but EF andmyocardial strain remained unchanged. Overall cavity twist reduced (p< 0. 048). Significant LVESD index reduction was only seen in TF group (p= 0. 02) with a slight increase in LVEF (p= 0. 04). Lateral MAPSE increased only in the TF group(p= 0. 02). LV longitudinal systolic strain remained unchanged in TA patients while apical lateral strain increased in TF group. LV apical <b>rotation</b> <b>fell</b> in the two groups but basal rotation increased only in the TA patients (p= 0. 02). LAVi reduced in bothgroups and to a greater extent in TF TAVI (p= 0. 006), as did TRPdrop (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: SAVR and TAVI are two effective treatments for severe AS patients. The severity of pre-operative systolic and diastolic LV dysfunction is the major predictor of mortality following SAVR for low-flow and high gradient AS. Peri-operative AVR survival is encouraging in the elderly. Long term mortality in the elderly is related to PPM, LV diastolic dysfunction and secondary pulmonary hypertension. LV functional recovery was evident in most patients with LV dysfunction after SAVR. A lower prevalence of LV functional recovery in patients with large pre-operative LVESD index might signify the loss of contractile reserveand thus predict post-operative functional recovery. TAVI results in significant early improvement of segmental and overall ventricular function, particularly in patients receiving the trans-femoral approach. The delayed recovery of the trans-apical TAVI group, we studied, might reflect worse pre-procedural diastolic cavity function...|$|R
