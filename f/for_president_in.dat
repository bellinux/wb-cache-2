5|$|During the 2009 special {{election}} in New York's 23rd congressional district, Gingrich endorsed moderate Republican candidate Dede Scozzafava, rather than Conservative Party candidate Doug Hoffman, {{who had been}} endorsed by several nationally prominent Republicans. He was heavily criticized for this endorsement, with conservatives questioning his candidacy <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> 2012 and even comparing him to Benedict Arnold. Gingrich has since regretted his decision.|$|E

His large margin of victory was due {{at least in part}} to the landslide win by fellow Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> the same election, which likely increased voter turnout.|$|E
5|$|Hawes {{was once}} close friends with Clay, though the {{friendship}} between them cooled when Hawes supported Zachary Taylor instead of Clay <b>for</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> 1848.

5|$|In {{the run-up}} to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Warren's name was put forward by liberal Democrats as a {{possible}} presidential candidate. However, Warren repeatedly stated that she was not running <b>for</b> <b>President</b> <b>in</b> 2016. In October 2013, she joined with the other fifteen Senate Democratic women in signing a letter that encouraged Hillary Clinton to run. There was much speculation about Warren being added to the Democratic ticket as a vice-presidential candidate. On June 9, 2016, after the California Democratic primary, Warren formally endorsed Hillary Clinton <b>for</b> <b>president.</b> <b>In</b> response to questions when she endorsed Clinton, Warren said that she believed herself to be ready to be vice president, but she was not being vetted. On July 7, CNN reported that Warren was on a five-person shortlist to be Clinton's vice-presidential running mate. However, Clinton eventually chose Tim Kaine.|$|E

5|$|The Greenbackers {{nominated}} Weaver <b>for</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> 1880, but {{he received}} only 3.3 {{percent of the}} popular vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and for the opening of Indian Territory to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new anti-big business third party, the People's Party ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee <b>for</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> 1892. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 {{percent of the popular}} vote and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats by the end of the 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan <b>for</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> 1896, 1900, and 1908. After serving as mayor of his home town, Colfax, Iowa, Weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office. He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's political goals remained unfulfilled at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Paul was speculated to run <b>for</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> 1992 but opted {{instead to}} work on the {{campaign}} for Pat Buchanan. That year, Marrou received the Libertarian presidential nomination. Paul later returned to the Republican Party and was re-elected to his seat in Congress in 1996, without much support from establishment Republicans, who supported the party-switching Democratic incumbent of the seat. Back in Congress, Paul regained his nickname of Dr. No, favoring a free market and advocating a reduction {{in the size of the}} federal government. He was drafted to challenge President George W. Bush in the 2004 Republican primaries, but chose not to run. He ran for president again in 2008 and 2012 as a Republican, attracting a large amount of grassroots support.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he owned}} a number of slaves, and his {{marriage}} to Virginia Shelby had {{left him with a}} good many more, Breckinridge had been a supporter of gradual emancipation and colonization of blacks since his early political career. As the sectional crisis worsened, this led him into several high-profile debates, notably with fellow Kentuckian Robert Wickliffe, the uncle of Robert C. Wickliffe. His support of Abraham Lincoln <b>for</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> the election of 1860 pitted him against his own nephew, Vice President John C. Breckinridge.|$|E

His father, an engineer, died when Arias was two years old, and he was raised primarily by his mother, aunt, and grandmother.

5|$|As the {{sectional}} conflict {{leading up}} to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. His support of Abraham Lincoln <b>for</b> <b>president</b> <b>in</b> the election of 1860 put him at odds with his nephew, John C. Breckinridge. The tragic scenario of brother against brother literally played out in Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871.|$|E
