In the present study, a 13 C litter <b>decomposition</b> <b>field</b> experiment was performed for 30 weeks in initial soils from a post-mining area near the city of Cottbus (Germany). Two of this regions' dominant but contrasting pioneering plant species (Lotus corniculatus L. and Calamagrostis epigejos L.) were chosen to investigate the effects of litter quality on the litter decomposing microbial food web in initially nutrient-poor substrates. The results clearly indicate the importance of litter quality, mainly the amount of N stored in the litter material and its bioavailability for the degradation process and the development of microbial communities in the detritusphere and bulk soil. Whereas the degradation process of the L. corniculatus litter which had a low C/N ratio was fast and most pronounced changes in the microbial community structure were observed 1 – 4 weeks after litter addition, the degradation of the C. epigejos litter material was slow and microbial community changes mainly occurred at between 4 and 30 weeks after litter addition to the soil.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a general method based on minimizing constitutive law gap functional {{in order to}} solve the Cauchy problem for a linear elliptic PDE. This functional measures {{the gap between the}} solutions of two well-posed problems. Each of these problems has one of the Cauchy data as known boundary condition: Dirichlet or Neumann, and on the boundary where the data is lacking, unknown Robin boundary conditions are imposed. These latter are controlled two by positives scalars. This approach generalizes that presented in Andrieux et al. and encompasses various methods proposed in the literature. According to the values of Robin's parameters when they tend to zero or infinity, there are two groups of methods: the first group includes those which depends on only one unknown data Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin. The second group includes those which depend on two unknown data Dirichlet and Neumann. Then, the equivalence between Euler-Lagrange conditions for the constitutive law functionals and interfacial operators usually used in the Domain <b>Decomposition</b> <b>field</b> is shown. Using the Hadamard example we analyse analytically the behavior of these operators as functions of the parameters.

Dog trainers {{are still looking for}} {{a better understanding of the}} dog olfaction matching mechanism to improve their training methods (1). How does the decomposition process differ between organs? Are there specific body parts better suited for dog training? What are the major volatile compounds responsible of the dogs’ match response? In the line of these questions, this project was monitoring the headspace of various human organs during the decomposition process. Five different organs, from five different bodies, were used: heart, lung, liver, kidney, and blood. Each organs were sampled in triplicates and let to decompose in glass jar. Regularly, the headspace of the jar was sampled by dynamic pumping to sorbent tubes that were further be desorbed on a comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography system (GC×GC).

PresleyCrop residue removal for {{livestock}} feeding and biofuel production at large scales must be evaluated to assess impacts on soil productivity and properties. Among all the potential negative impacts, wind erosion {{is a major}} concern in the central Great Plains. We conducted an on-farm study from 2011 to 2013 by removing crop residue at five levels (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 %) {{to determine the effects of}} crop residue removal on soil wind erosion parameters such as dry aggregate size distribution including soil wind erodible fraction (EF 75 %. The total amount of soil loss in 3 hours ranged from about 0. 2 to 2. 5 kg mˉ² and depends on soil condition and crop residue cover. On the other hand, high-yielding crops can produce abundant crop residue, which then raises the question that if a farmer wants to reduce residue, what could they do without removing it? The application of fertilizer on crop residue to stimulate microbial activity and subsequent decomposition of the residue is often debated. We conducted wheat straw <b>decomposition</b> <b>field</b> experiments under different fertilizer rates and combinations at three locations in western Kansas following wheat harvest in 2011 and 2012. A double shear box apparatus instrumented with a load cell measured the shear stress required to cut wheat straw and photomicrography was used to measure the cross-sectional area of wheat straw after shearing. Total C and N were also analyzed. The fertilizer rate and timing of application during summer 2012 and Fall 2013 at the Hays site had impacts on wheat straw shear stress at break point. Across site years, earlier (fall) fertilizer application generally resulted in lower remaining aboveground biomass as compared to a spring application.

40|$|Climate {{warming and}} {{increased}} atmospheric nitrogen deposition may substantially influence biosphere C cycling {{over the next}} century by altering ecosystem processes such as productivity and <b>decomposition.</b> <b>Field</b> studies are commonly used to explore plant responses to global change, although the underlying mechanisms {{can be difficult to}} isolate owing to the lack of control of factors such as plant-animal interactions. Ultimately, indirect effects via herbivore and detritivore responses may feedback to influence plant responses to the experimental treatments. The goal of this thesis was to explore interactions among biotic and abiotic drivers of carbon dynamics within the context of experimental warming and nitrogen addition in the field. Evidence from a herbivore exclusion experiment revealed that mollusc effects on net primary productivity were more pronounced in warmed plots than in ambient temperature plots, likely as a result of temperature-related increases in mollusc metabolic activity and plant consumption rate. Furthermore, the effects of rodent exclusion on grass biomass were significantly greater in N-fertilized plots than non-fertilized plots. Feeding experiments suggested that this finding is likely attributed to increased grass palatability in response to N addition. Results from a litter decomposition experiment indicated that warming impeded the contribution of detritivores to carbon turnover, though this effect was transient. Increased precipitation {{over the course of the}} experiment may have promoted recovery of the detritivore community, and could also account for the significant detritivore effects observed following one year of incubation. Reciprocal litter transplants between the treatments plots and untreated areas of the field indicated that the observed responses from the main experiment were unlikely to be accounted for by the individual effects of litter quality or microenvironment alone. Overall, the influence of global change factors such as warming and increased atmospheric nitrogen deposition on carbon-related processes such as productivity can be substantially modified by indirect effects on herbivore dynamics, with consumer-specific treatment effects suggesting that this relationship is complex and can depend on both diet quality and microclimate. Though detritivores were relatively insensitive to warming and N addition as decomposition progressed, they likely play an important role in the overall magnitude of ecosystem C turnover...|$|E

40|$|On the {{southeast}} coast of Australia, there are extensive infestations {{of the environmental}} weed Chrysanthemoides monilifera ssp. rotundata (L.) T. Norl. (Bitou bush). This weed is highly invasive and persistent, yet {{little is known about}} how it impacts on coastal ecosystems. Plant invasions can greatly alter the area they invade, and can modify primary productivity, plant species composition, species diversity, decrease ecosystem stability and disrupt ecosystem processes. This research aimed to determine if C. monilifera invasion changes leaf litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. Leaf litter invertebrates were also investigated as they play key roles in functioning of forest ecosystems and can greatly enhance litter decomposition and nutrient cycling. The herbicide glyphosate is widely used to control C. monilifera, however there have been few studies examining the effects of this herbicide on invertebrate communities in the field, especially on sand dunes. I aimed to determine if glyphosate application impacts leaf litter invertebrate involved in <b>decomposition.</b> <b>Field</b> studies and experiments were undertaken in five sites along the NSW coastline, each with an area heavily infested with C. monilifera and in native un-infested area. A litterbag decomposition study found that the succulent C. monilifera leaves decomposed at least three times faster than a sclerophyllous native leaf mix (Acacia longifolia var. longifolia, Banksia integrifolia and Leptospermum laevigatum) with the decomposition rates being related to the physical properties of the leaves. Nutrients were leached and mineralised quicker from the C. monilifera leaves, mostly due to the rapid decay. There was some immobilisation of sulphur and phosphorous in the native leaves when placed in the native sites and more immobilisation is expected with time. C. monoilifera leaves decayed significantly faster in coarse mesh litterbags compared to the fine mesh, indicating leaf littler invertebrates positively influenced their decomposition. Mesh size had little effect on the native leaf decomposition rate. All C. monilifera litterbags and the coarse native litterbags decomposed faster and generally had greater nutrient loss within the C. monilifera infestations. This is due to an increase in invertebrate detritivores within the C. monilifera, and dense infestations creating a protected environment with an altered microclimate. There was a greater input of litter to the native sites, and this was highly seasonal compared to the C. monilifera areas. Maximal litter fall corresponded with period of peak flowering and growth (spring-summer). Due to the higher leaf fall rate there is a greater input of nutrients to the forest floor in the native sites, even though large amounts of nutrients were withdrawn from the leaves before abscission. The slow decomposition and high litter fall resulted in greater amounts of litter accumulating on the native forest floor, which appears to act as a nutrient sink. Invasion by C. monilifera in coastal areas does not appear to change the nitrogen budget, but there are differences in where nitrogen is stored in comparison to uninvaded areas. The total soil nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen were significantly greater in most of the bitou bush sites, whereas in the native vegetation there was more nitrogen held within the leaf litter layer. Nitrogen appears to be cycled faster in the weedy areas, mainly as result of the increase in leaf quality and the speed of breakdown. Leaf litter invertebrate abundance and assemblage were compared between habitats over twelve months. The total abundance was not significantly reduced in the weedy habitat but the abundance of mites, thrips, spiders, ants, and centipedes was reduced at many sites. The invertebrate assemblages also differed between habitats, with the C. monilifera supporting a lower diversity of beetles. However, the millipedes, amphipods, earthworms, pseudoscorpions and isopods appeared to respond positively to the invasion, occurring in higher abundance and detected more frequently in the weedy areas. This has been attributed to the change in microclimate within C. monilifera infestations, which are moister and darker, which these invertebrates tend to prefer. Furthermore as the leaf litter is of lower quantity and higher quality, and possibly higher palatability, than the native sclerophyllous vegetation, the detritivores assemblages seems to have responded positively. To determine the impact of the herbicide glyphosate on the non-target litter invertebrates control and impact sites were selected in coastal hind dunes heavily infested with C. monilifera. The impact sites were sprayed with a 1 : 100 dilution of Roundup(superscript R) Biactive (superscript TM). The herbicide application had no direct or indirect effect on leaf litter invertebrate abundance or community composition in the four months following application. The litter invertebrate assemblages were highly variable on a small spatial scale with abiotic factors more strongly regulating leaf litter invertebrate numbers than glyphosate application. These results conflict with previous studies, indicating the detrimental indirect effects herbicide application has on non-target litter invertebrates may depend upon the application rate, the vegetation community and structure and post spray weather. Invasion by C. monilifera has changed the movement of leaf litter and the cycling of nutrients within coastal ecosystems, mainly through a change in quality and quantity of leaf litter. It has impacted on the litter invertebrates, which has amplified the increase in decomposition rate. The change in soil nutrient availability could increase the competitive superiority of C. monilifera directly by increasing growth rate, or indirectly by impairing the establishment of native species...|$|E
