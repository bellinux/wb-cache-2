The first problem was to find the irradiation damage mechanism of the nonlinear materials. In this paper the irradiation <b>electronic</b> <b>field</b> originating from high speed charged particle beams was discussed. The calculating model of the <b>electronic</b> <b>field,</b> based on the relativistic mechanics and electro-magnetic theory, was founded. The common characters of the irradiation <b>electronic</b> <b>field</b> were predicted and the fields of α ray and β ray were calculated by means of our model. The simulating {{results showed that the}} intensity of the electric field increased with the energy or the intensity of the beam. The results also showed that the field change trend of α ray and β ray was similar, but the field value was quite different. When the beam intensity I ＝ 100 μA and the beam energy εm ＝ 500 Mev, the <b>electronic</b> <b>field</b> values were about 3. 5 × 107 v/m for α ray and 2. 4 × 1011 v/m for β ray...|$|R

40|$|Biological {{research}} in the field is constrained by the speed and difficulty of species determination, as well as by access to relevant information about the species encountered. However, recent work on vision-based algorithms raises the promise of rapid botanical species identification. The potential for mobile vision-based identification provides opportunities for new user interface techniques. To explore these issues, we present LeafView, a Tablet-PC–based user interface for an <b>electronic</b> <b>field</b> guide that supports automated identification of botanical species in the field. We describe a user interface design based on an ethnographic study of botanists, field tests of working prototypes by botanists at the Smithsonian Institution on Plummers Island, Maryland, and observations at an internal exhibition at the Smithsonian at which other staff members tried the prototypes. We present functionality specific to mobile identification and collection in the <b>electronic</b> <b>field</b> guide and use this to motivate discussion of mobile identification in general.

The {{results showed that the}} electronic structures of zigzag and armchair edge SnO 2 NRs exhibit an indirect semiconducting nature and the band gaps demonstrate a remarkable reduction with the increase of external transverse <b>electronic</b> <b>field</b> intensity, which demonstrate a giant Stark effect. The value of the critical electric field for bare Z-SnO 2 NRs is smaller than A-SnO 2 NRs. In addition, the different hydrogen passivation nanoribbons (Z-SnO 2 NRs- 2 H and A-SnO 2 NRs-OH) show different band gaps and a slightly weaker Stark effect. The band gap of A-SnO 2 NRs-OH obviously is enhanced while the Z-SnO 2 NRs- 2 H reduce. Interestingly, the Z-SnO 2 NRs-OH presented the convert of metal-semiconductor-metal under external transverse <b>electronic</b> <b>fields.</b> In the end, the electronic transport properties of the different edges SnO 2 NRs are studied.

Other examples of digital video formats utilizing compression were Ampex's DCT (the first to employ such when introduced in 1992), the industry-standard DV and MiniDV (and its professional variations, Sony's DVCAM and Panasonic's DVCPRO), and Betacam SX, a lower-cost variant of Digital Betacam using MPEG-2 compression.|$|E

There is also a section where electronic news-gathering (ENG) operations are based, receiving remote broadcasts via remote pickup unit or satellite TV. Outside broadcasting vans, production trucks, or SUVs with <b>electronic</b> <b>field</b> <b>production</b> (EFP) equipment are sent out with reporters, who may also bring back news stories on video tape rather than sending them back live.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>field</b> <b>production</b> {{cameras are}} similar to studio cameras {{in that they are}} used {{primarily}} in multiple camera switched configurations, but outside the studio environment, for concerts, sports and live news coverage of special events. These versatile cameras can be carried on the shoulder, or mounted on camera pedestals and cranes, with the large, very long focal length zoom lenses made for studio camera mounting. These cameras have no recording ability on their own, and transmit their signals back to the broadcast truck through a fiber optic, triax or the virtually obsolete multicore cable.|$|E

The equations derived in that paper depict the structure and properties of the electron {{as well as of}} other leptons including neutrinos. Since in nature there are only two stable charged elementary particles, the electron and proton (with their antiparticles), it is logical to suppose that in nature there is a protonic field too whose description is analogous with the one of the <b>electronic</b> <b>field.</b> The equations obtained in the paper and describing the proton and other baryons differ in some detail from the ones for the <b>electronic</b> <b>field.</b> A section of the paper is devoted to nuclei where the <b>electronic</b> and protonic <b>fields</b> are present simultaneously without neutrons.

50|$|Hand-held {{camera or}} {{hand-held}} shooting is a filmmaking and video production technique {{in which a}} camera is held in the camera operator's hands {{as opposed to being}} mounted on a tripod or other base. Hand-held cameras are used because they are conveniently sized for travel and because they allow greater freedom of motion during filming. Newsreel camera operators frequently gathered images using a hand-held camera. Virtually all modern video cameras are small enough for hand-held use, but many professional video cameras are designed specifically for hand-held use such as for electronic news-gathering (ENG), and <b>electronic</b> <b>field</b> <b>production</b> (EFP).|$|E
