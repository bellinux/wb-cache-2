In response to anti-immigrant rallies in the eastern city of Dresden in late 2014, Schäuble said that immigration is good for Germany and politicians must explain better that everyone stands to gain from it; at the time, the number of asylum seekers in Germany, many from Syria, had more than doubled within a year to around 200,000, and net immigration was at its highest level in two decades. [...] "Just as we used millions of refugees and expellees after World War Two to rebuild.. so we need immigration today," [...] Schäuble told Bild {{when asked about the}} popularity of anti-immigration policies. Also, he held that [...] "people are right to fear Islamist terrorism. But not Islam." [...] In September 2015, he urged the Member States of the European Union to quickly establish a common <b>European</b> <b>asylum</b> law.|$|E

However, <b>European</b> Union <b>asylum</b> law also carries within it the risk of undermining protection.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} explain the varying, and {{sometimes}} intriguing, outcomes {{of the past three}} Treaty revision negotiations of <b>European</b> Union/Community visa, <b>asylum</b> and immigration policy. Regarding this policy area, I focus on the substantial constitutional issues of decision rules and institutional set-up. The results of the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) negotiations leading to the Amsterdam Treaty, the Treaty of Nice and the Constitutional Treaty are subjected to causal analysis. The paper draws on a revised neofunctionalist framework and argues that five explanatory factors can account for the Treaty outcomes: (1) functional pressures; (2) the role of supranational institutions; (3) socialisation, deliberation and learning processes; (4) exogenous pressures; and (5) countervailing forces. political science; intergovernmental conferences; treaty reform; <b>European</b> Convention; <b>asylum</b> policy; immigration policy; neo-functionalism; socialization...|$|R
40|$|An {{examination}} {{of the history of}} mental illness and its treatment over the centuries reveals that the mentally ill have few advocates except each other and that their treatment has consisted of confinement and neglect. Reformers have pioneered for change, experienced brief success, but ultimately conditions for the mentally ill regress. Society continues to abhor mental illness as though its collective consciousness still believes in possession by evil spirits. Discussion of the early history moves from banishment to ships of fools, to <b>European</b> <b>asylums,</b> and to institutions run by the states in America. More recent history focuses on the National Committee for Mental Hygiene and its campaign for child guidance clinics, the Community Mental Health Centers legislation and community support projects.

60|$|These priests carried astronomical {{science to}} {{a high level of}} accuracy. They knew their year better than the Babylonians of whom we shall {{presently}} tell. In Yucatan they had a kind of writing, the Maya writing, of the most curious and elaborate character. So far as {{we have been able to}} decipher it, it was used mainly for keeping the exact and complicated calendars upon which the priests expended their intelligence. The art of the Maya civilization came to a climax about 700 or 800 A.D. The sculptured work of these people amazes the modern observer by its great plastic power and its frequent beauty, and perplexes him by a grotesqueness and by a sort of insane conventionality and intricacy outside the circle of his ideas. There is nothing quite like it in the old world. The nearest approach, and that is a remote one, is found in archaic Indian carvings. Everywhere there are woven feathers and serpents twine in and out. Many Maya inscriptions resemble a certain sort of elaborate drawing made by lunatics in <b>European</b> <b>asylums,</b> more than any other old-world work. It is as if the Maya mind {75} had developed upon a different line from the old-world mind, had a different twist to its ideas, was not, by old-world standards, a rational mind at all.|$|R
