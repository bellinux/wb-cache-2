5|$|According to Gandhi, {{religion}} {{is not about}} what a man believes, it is about how a man lives, how he relates to other people, his conduct towards others, and one's relationship to one's conception of god. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important</b> to convert or to join any religion, {{but it is important}} to improve one's way of life and conduct by absorbing ideas from any source and any religion, believed Gandhi.|$|E
5|$|Unpaired males find a {{suitable}} cavity {{and begin to}} build nests {{in order to attract}} single females, often decorating the nest with ornaments such as flowers and fresh green material, which the female later disassembles upon accepting him as a mate. The amount of green material <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important,</b> as long as some is present, but the presence of herbs in the decorative material appears to be significant in attracting a mate. The scent of plants such as yarrow acts as an olfactory attractant to females.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} to make a Doppler radar without any pulsing, known as a continuous-wave radar (CW radar), by sending out a very pure signal of a known frequency. CW radar is ideal for determining the radial component of a target's velocity. CW radar is typically used by traffic enforcement to measure vehicle speed quickly and accurately where range <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
25|$|Grain-gas heating: Collisions at high densities between gas {{atoms and}} {{molecules}} with dust grains can transfer thermal energy. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important</b> in HII regions because UV radiation is more important. It {{is also not}} important in diffuse ionized medium due to the low density. In the neutral diffuse medium grains are always colder, but do not effectively cool the gas due to the low densities.|$|E
25|$|For his 2011 {{exhibition}} of drawings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Serra reworked {{some of his}} earlier pieces on paper which had been damaged or destroyed, recreating them specifically for the show. The museum labeled the works with two dates: that of the original {{and that of the}} reworked version. According to Serra, however, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important</b> whether audiences know which version they are seeing.|$|E

25|$|Noble {{has been}} {{performing}} stand-up since the dyslexia diagnosis, and {{appeared in his}} local comedy club {{at the age of}} 15, despite licensing laws that prohibited him working there and forced him to leave through the kitchen. Noble studied performing arts at Newcastle College, after he told his careers adviser at school {{he wanted to be a}} comedian. He later stated that this had no effect on his stand-up ability, as he believes that the information taught <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important</b> in being a good performer.|$|E
25|$|Ray casting is {{primarily}} used for realtime simulations, {{such as those}} used in 3D computer games and cartoon animations, where detail <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important,</b> or where it is more efficient to manually fake the details {{in order to obtain}} better performance in the computational stage. This is usually the case when a large number of frames need to be animated. The resulting surfaces have a characteristic 'flat' appearance when no additional tricks are used, as if objects in the scene were all painted with matte finish.|$|E
25|$|For a given {{scene and}} subject magnification, the {{background}} blur increases with lens focal length. If it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important</b> that background objects be unrecognizable, background de-emphasis {{can be increased}} by using a lens of longer focal length and increasing the subject distance to maintain the same magnification. This technique requires that sufficient space {{in front of the}} subject be available; moreover, the perspective of the scene changes because of the different camera position, and this {{may or may not be}} acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Knifeline attack (KLA) {{is another}} kind of {{corrosion}} affecting welds, impacting steels stabilized by niobium. Niobium and niobium carbide dissolves in steel at very high temperatures. At some cooling regimes, niobium carbide does not precipitate, and the steel then behaves like unstabilized steel, forming chromium carbide instead. This affects only a thin zone several millimeters wide in the very vicinity of the weld, {{making it difficult to}} spot and increasing the corrosion speed. Structures made of such steels have to be heated in a whole to about , when the chromium carbide dissolves and niobium carbide forms. The cooling rate after this treatment <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
25|$|When {{the suit}} is being used correctly, the bubble inside it is {{relatively}} small, and its movement <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important.</b> The bubble may be large {{for a variety of}} reasons: if a diver has ascended without venting the suit; if the valve supplying gas to dry suit fails in the open position; or if the diver is over-weighted, and extra air has been added to the suit at some point to make the diver neutrally buoyant. The size of the bubble can be minimised by being correctly weighted and venting excess gas from the suit on ascent. Some divers ensure that the bubble remains {{at the top of their}} body by using the buoyancy compensator to counteract any excess weighting, keeping only the minimum gas necessary to avoid squeeze inside the drysuit.|$|E
25|$|Landscape Archaeology {{has been}} {{useful in the}} {{analysis}} of cultural identities that developed among social and racial groups. It has been argued that the existence and continued use of yard spaces among Black Americans (along with other African-derived practices observed in the Americas) is proof of a distinct, new world, cultural identity. One feature that appears to be widespread throughout the African diaspora is the significant importance of yard spaces in the everyday lives of African-Americans. Sidney W. Mintz, in describing the “house-and-yard pattern” among African-American peasants residing in the Caribbean, explains “…the house, particularly among poorer peasants, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important</b> in itself as a material representation (i.e. material culture/artifacts) of the domestic group or family”. Mintz further states that while the house “…is usually used mainly for sleeping and for storing clothing and other articles of personal value” the yard is where “…children play, the washing is done, the family relaxes, and friends are entertained”.|$|E

25|$|On August 23, 2008, the Democratic {{nominee for}} President, Barack Obama, {{announced}} that Biden would be joining {{him on the}} ticket as the Vice Presidential nominee. Delaware law allowed Biden to run for Vice President and Senator at the same time, so he would have kept the seat if the ticket had lost. In 2000, the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee Joe Lieberman ran similarly. On November 4, 2008, Barack Obama won the presidential election, making Biden the next VP. Biden vacated his senate seat shortly after the election, allowing for the Governor of Delaware to appoint a successor. There was speculation {{as to whether the}} outgoing Governor, Ruth Ann Minner, or the incoming Governor-elect Jack Markell would make the appointment, and if Biden's son, Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden would receive the appointment. On November 24, 2008, Governor Minner appointed Biden's longtime Chief of Staff Ted Kaufman to fill the seat. Kaufman subsequently announced that he would not seek election to a full term in 2010, effectively making him a caretaker. Biden's Republican opponent in the Senate race, conservative political commentator Christine O'Donnell, tried to make an issue of Biden's dual campaigns, claiming that serving his constituents <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important</b> to him. Kaufman has since stated that he will not run for the unexpired term in 2010.|$|E

[...] The light curves are all similar, although Type Ia are generally brighter at peak luminosity, but the light curve <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>important</b> for classification of Type I supernovae.|$|E
