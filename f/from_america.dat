5|$|The bolete {{is found}} from eastern Canada south to Florida and Mississippi, west to Michigan in the United States. The {{distribution}} extends south to Mexico, Costa Rica, and Colombia. It {{is one of}} several boletes that have a north to south clinal trend. In Asia, the species has been reported from India, Korea, China, and Taiwan. Taiwanese specimens tend to have slightly smaller spores (10–16 by 4–5μm) than those from mainland China or <b>from</b> <b>America.</b>|$|E

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} {{the tour}} the band members became {{involved}} in a dispute with their manager, Decca Records' Phil Solomon, over the revenues paid to them; that, coupled with the expiry of their work visas, meant the band returned <b>from</b> <b>America</b> dejected. After two more concerts in Ireland, Them split up. Morrison concentrated on writing some of the songs that would appear on Astral Weeks, while the remnants of the band reformed in 1967 and relocated in America.|$|E
5|$|For a few centuries, Europeans had {{experimented with}} American vines and plants in their soil, and many {{varieties}} were imported <b>from</b> <b>America</b> without regulation, disregarding {{the possibility of}} pest transfer, and related problems. Jules-Emile Planchon, a French biologist, who identified the Phylloxera in the 1860s, maintained that this transfer of American vines and plants into Europe greatly increased between roughly 1858 and 1862, {{and this is how}} the Phylloxera was accidentally introduced to Europe around 1860, although the aphid did not enter France until around 1863. It is believed that the advent of steamships was a factor as well, as the ships were faster, and the Phylloxera were able to survive the quicker ocean voyage.|$|E
5|$|Howe {{benefited from}} Montagu's withdrawal, {{as his own}} {{battered}} fleet passed close {{to the scene of}} this stand-off on 10 June, pushing north into the English Channel. With Villaret and Cornic fortuitously pursuing Montagu to the south, Howe was free to pass Ushant without difficulty and arrived off Plymouth on 12 June, joined soon afterwards by Montagu. Villaret had anchored with Cornic in Bertheaume Bay the day before, but Saint-André refused to allow him to enter Brest until the republican attitudes of the town's population had been assessed. On 12 June, the convoy <b>from</b> <b>America</b> finally arrived off France, having lost just one ship in passage during a storm.|$|E

5|$|Its first {{association}} with the potato plant (Solanum tuberosum) was not made until about 1859 when it began destroying potato crops {{in the region of}} Omaha, Nebraska. Its spread eastward was rapid, at an average distance of 140km per year. By 1874 it had reached the Atlantic Coast. From 1871, the American entomologist Charles Valentine Riley warned Europeans about the potential for an accidental infestation caused by the transportation of the beetle <b>from</b> <b>America.</b> From 1875, several western European countries, including Germany, Belgium, France and Switzerland, banned imports of American potatoes to avoid infestation by L. decemlineata.|$|E
5|$|Pound {{returned}} <b>from</b> <b>America</b> in 1911 {{and resumed}} his visits to Olivia and Dorothy, adhering to Olivia's restrictions. That October Pound formally asked to marry Dorothy; her father refused {{on the basis}} of Pound's meagre income. Neither Dorothy nor Pound gave up: he again asked for permission to marry her in March 1912 but was again rejected. In Dorothy's mind they continued to be engaged, although they were only allowed short visits in the Family drawing room once a week or every two weeks.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Darren {{returns to}} Hollyoaks village <b>from</b> <b>America</b> three years later, Darren begins a {{skimming}} scam which {{is found out}} by his boss Scott who refuses to give him time off work. In retaliation he plants incriminating evidence on Scott's computer before calling the police. Scott sets fire to The Loft with Darren inside, but Scott becomes trapped and Darren leaves him for dead. Darren is told no trace of Scott has been found, but Scott is alive and sends threatening postcards to Darren. Scott attacks Darren, who pleads with Scott not to kill him, but the police arrive shortly after.|$|E

5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the lengthy building times of these ships, other countries were able to build dreadnoughts that were superior in protection and armament, {{with the exception of}} the French. Construction was delayed by late deliveries of the 305-millimeter guns and armor plates as well as shortages of labor. The Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912 diverted workers at the shipyards for repairs and maintenance of the ships participating in the war. The Italians imported the raw nickel steel for their armor <b>from</b> <b>America</b> and Britain and processed it into their equivalent of Krupp cemented armor, called Terni cemented, but there were problems with this process and suitable plates took longer to produce than planned.|$|E
5|$|Texans were {{hesitant}} {{to pursue a}} US-Texas treaty without a written commitment of military defense <b>from</b> <b>America,</b> since a full-scale military attack by Mexico seemed likely when the negotiations became public. If ratification of the annexation measure stalled in the US Senate, Texas could face a war alone against Mexico. Because only Congress could declare war, the Tyler administration lacked the constitutional authority to commit the US to support of Texas. But when Secretary Upshur provided a verbal assurance of military defense, President Houston, responding to urgent calls for annexation from the Texas Congress of December 1843, authorized the reopening of annexation negotiations.|$|E
5|$|The {{restoration}} of peace inevitably meant {{a reduction in}} military expenditure, but {{this was more than}} offset by a large increase in liner and cruise ship traffic to Gibraltar. British liners travelling to and from India and South Africa customarily stopped there, as did French, Italian and Greek liners travelling to and <b>from</b> <b>America.</b> Oil bunkering became a major industry alongside coaling. An airfield was established in 1933 on the isthmus linking Gibraltar to Spain. Civil society was reformed as well; in 1921 an Executive Council and an elected City Council were established to advise the governor, in the first step towards self-government of the territory.|$|E
