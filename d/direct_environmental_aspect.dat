40|$|Background Sustainability {{has become}} a key issue in the apparel {{industry}} and sustainable actions are now incorporated into many firms’ strategies. Increased sustainability in business activities calls for developments and changes in existing systems throughout entire value chains and garment life cycles. These efforts involve environmental {{as well as social}} and economic sustainability. Many sportswear companies have been driving forces of textile development and sustainability trends in fashion. Purpose The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate how Swedish sportswear companies work with sustainable development in their value chains. This concerns what changes they have made, and plan to make, throughout their value chains to become more sustainable. Researchers aim to study footprint reducing efforts, and identify challenges in implementing sustainability efforts. Methodology This thesis is conducted as a qualitative research study designed as multiple case studies with selected Swedish sportswear companies. The empirical material is collected through semistructured interviews with representatives at selected case companies. Results The analysis of theoretical and empirical findings shows that studied companies work actively with sustainable value chain development, and that these efforts are increasing continuously. Environmental, social and economic sustainability issues are all accounted for, but focus is currently <b>directed</b> to <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> Implemented changes, as well as challenges in implementing these changes, are described.

Regulated polluting facilities are increasingly embracing pollution minimization strategies that involve the adoption of broadly defined systems to manage <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> Despite a meaningful empirical literature, {{whether or not these}} systems lead to better environmental performance remains an open question. This study seeks to assess the possible connection between systems to manage <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and improved <b>environmental</b> performance. It also seeks to identify the factors determining the extent of the adopted system of management and the factors’ <b>direct</b> effects on <b>environmental</b> performance. For this empirical analysis, the study examines the extent of systems to manage <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> employed by and the level of wastewater discharged by U.

40|$|This {{research}} paper {{is focused on}} the study of various <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and their impacts arising from the Indian manufacturing industries. Our environment is being polluted day by day due to rapid industrialization. Today the delicate ecosystem of our planet is facing a danger of destruction on a scale as never before in the history of mankind. Forests are diminishing at an alarming rate, landmasses are getting eroded, climate {{in different parts of the}} world is undergoing a change due to global warming and clean air and water are increasingly becoming rare commodities. So it is high time to be aware and alert about environmental protection which cannot be done without understanding the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> Present study tried to explain the significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> arising from Indian manufacturing industries by analyzing the data collected through questionnaire survey. It is observed from collected data that emission to air is most significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> in Indian manufacturing industries in respect to severity i. e. the effect of this <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> is more harmful for human beings. Noise <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> is having more efficiency, probability and duration, it means this <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> is produced in each and every manufacturing company and affects the environment.

40|$|An {{environmental}} review {{has been carried}} out at FORIA AB, a transportation- and machine service company, to analyze the company’s <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> from the transportation segment. This report describes the essential background and the methods of identifying and evaluate the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> It also describes how the work with the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> often vary between different actors. The design of the ISO 14001 is intentionally broad in order to apply on all sorts of activities and organizations. The report describes the ISO 14001 requirements regarding the work with the identification of the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> and the requirements within the organization. Further, the report describes how the Swedish Transport Policy is designed, and how the transportation goal and the intermediate goal “good environment” looks like today. Transportation means in the extension an environmental impact of some kind. The emissions and discharge which derives from transport is accounted and also which impact they can have on the environment. The environmental investigation within the transportation segment at FORIA consists of a methodical and analytical procedure for identifying the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> has been designed. The <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> influence on the environment is valued and described. The valuation model is designed and developed for FORIA. Based on the evaluation of the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> within the transportation segment the concluded significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> are: fuel, noise and transport planning.

It builds on a previous study that documents relatively few <b>direct</b> <b>environmental</b> indicators at shop floor level, which raises questions about possible indirect links between existing indicators and the environment {{that could be used}} to improve the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of company´s sustainability ambitions.   A method for identifying and categorizing indirect links to sustainability issues was defined and used. The results suggest that at shop floor level 90 % of the indicators have at least an indirect relation to one or more of the sustainability dimensions economy, environment and social, of which 26 % are at least indirectly related to the environmental dimension. Despite the many indirect connections, participating companies perceive a need to improve sustainability indicators and some ideas are suggested. SureBPM...|$|R

40|$|Education {{provided}} by schools {{requires that the}} teaching promotes sustainable development and help students to develop a commitment to influence development in a sustainable direction. Using ISO 14001, schools can reduce their environmental impact, while students become involved in environmental activities. This report shows how an initial environmental review of a pre- and elementary school can be conducted, and how short-term and long-term environmental targets for the significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> can be identified. The initial environmental review of Nyckelknippan förskole AB can hopefully provide a basis on which {{the establishment of the}} environmental management system ISO 14001 can be developed. The methodology for the initial environmental review had a starting point of already proposed <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> that were investigated and quantified. A list of environmental laws was compiled and linked to the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were evaluated using an FMEA where the significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were identified; energy consumption, chemical use, accidents, consumables, wastes, internal transportation and education. The proposals on objectives and targets for the significant <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> were linked to the Stockholm County regional environmental objectives and can be further developed together with teachers and students. It is possible to improve the initial environmental review in the future as part of the standard's requirements for continuous improvement, depending on if Nyckelknippan förskole AB chooses to continue the implementation of the environmental management system ISO 14001. ...|$|R

40|$|The problem {{addressed}} in this thesis is how to account for <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> when purchasing freight transports. This problem is addressed from a transport purchasing perspective. The result of the research is a model for how transport purchasers can incorporate <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> when purchasing freight transports. This mode! is built on two tools and a work process. The first too! is a structural approach to enable transport purchasers to assess environmental performance of transport suppliers. The other too! is a method for assessing <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of a specific transport relation. The second tool furthermore includes a method for how to allocate the <b>environmental</b> <b>aspect</b> of transports to the cargo transported and a method for how to determine <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> of a specific transport relation. The aspects accounted for are the input of energy and the output of emissions of carbon dioxide, sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons and particulate. The work process describes how the tools {{can be used in}} order to support continuous improvements. The work process is described according to the Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle. The research has been both case study inspired as well as action research oriented. The model was developed in a company where the researcher actively participated in its development. The company in the case study is a major European transport purchaser. The practical implication of the result is a method, which enables transport purchasers to account for <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> in their purchasing work. The theoretical implication of this method can be a step towards developing general theory of accounting for the environment in transport purchasing...|$|R

This model considers the interactions between basic services, infrastructure and <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> Maps are shown which localize and define the state of basic needs in infrastructure, services and environment quality. The most vulnerable areas and trends in life quality are identified from the integration of different urban services and <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects</b> according to their consolidation. This allowed us to define homogeneous areas with significant differences in quality and singularities among urban services and <b>environmental</b> <b>aspects.</b> Finally, we make some methodological and operational considerations regarding advantages and limitations experienced in implementing the model...|$|R
