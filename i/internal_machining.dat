Investigation to realize high productivity and high accuracy is performed with different electrodeposited CBN wheels under various grinding conditions. Grinding characteristics such as grinding forces, torque and surface roughness were measured. The main results obtained are as follows. (1) Grinding accuracy improved {{with an increase in}} peripheral speed of grinding wheel. (2) Grinding forces and torque decrease with an increase in peripheral speed of wheel but increase with wheel depth of cut and work feed rate. (3) Grinding forces and torque increase with the cumulative stock removal which is caused by the progress of attritional wear of CBN abrasive grains. (4) A clear reduction of grinding forces is caused by quill motion overlapping the main axis and is induced by the decrease in the mean chip volume and/or the mean chip cross-sectional area...|$|E

50|$|Packet {{filtering}} is one {{defense against}} IP spoofing attacks. The gateway {{to a network}} usually performs ingress filtering, which is blocking of packets from outside the network with a source address inside the network. This prevents an outside attacker spoofing the address of an <b>internal</b> <b>machine.</b> Ideally the gateway would also perform egress filtering on outgoing packets, which is blocking of packets from inside the network with a source address that is not inside. This prevents an attacker within the network performing filtering from launching IP spoofing attacks against external machines.|$|R

Abstract — Controlled speed sensorless ac drives have reached a stage of development permitting good dynamic performance above 3 % of rated speed. However, the ac-curacy of the rotor speed estimation under load remains sensitive to parameter errors of the <b>internal</b> <b>machine</b> model. This paper presents an approach that ensures high steady-state speed accuracy in addition to high dynamic perform-ance. To eliminate the speed estimation error, the ma-chine parameters are adapted on-line, based on the evalu-ation of rotor slot harmonic effects. A stator flux oriented control scheme is implemented in a digital signalproces-sor system to demonstrate the robustness of the speed es-timation to parameter variations. Experimental results dem-onstrate that the control system advantageously combines high dynamic performance with accuracy of speed esti-mation. 1...|$|R
