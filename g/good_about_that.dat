6000|$|As I {{have said}} already, the {{adventure}} {{on the river}} made {{a good deal of}} noise, in that simple community; and it had the effect to render Guert and myself a sort of heroes, in a small way; bringing me much more into notice, than would otherwise have been the case. I thought that Guert, in particular, would be likely to reap its benefit; for, various elderly persons, who were in the habit of frowning, whenever his name was mentioned, I was given to understand, could now smile; and two or three of the most severe among the Albany moralists, were heard to say that, [...] "after all, there was some <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> Guert Ten Eyck." [...] The reader will not require to be told, that a high-school moralist, in a place as retired and insulated as Albany, must necessarily be a being that became subject to a very severe code. Morality, as I understand the matter, has a good deal of convention about it. There is town-morality and country-morality, all over the world, as they tell me. But, in America, our morals were, and long have been, separated into three great and very distinct classes; viz.--New England, or puritan-morals; middle colonies, or liberal morals; and southern colonies, or latitudinarian morals. I shall not pretend to point out all the shades of difference in these several schools; though that in which I had myself been taught, was necessarily the most in conformity with my own tastes. There were minor shades {{to be found in the}} same school; Guert and myself belonging to different classes. His morals were of the Dutch class; while mine more properly belonged to the English. The great characteristic of the Dutch school, was the tendency to excess that prevailed, when indulgences were sought. With them, it did not rain often; but, when it did rain, it was pretty certain to pour. Old Col. Follock was a case in point, on this scare; nor was his son Dirck, young and diffident as he was, altogether an exception to the rule. There was not a more respectable man in the colony, in the main, than Col. Van Valkenburgh. He was well connected; had a handsome unencumbered estate; and money at interest;--was a principal prop, in the church of his neighbourhood; was esteemed as a good husband; a good father; a true friend; a kind neighbour; an excellent, and loyal subject, and a thoroughly honest man. Nevertheless, Col. Van Valkenburgh had his weak times and seasons. He would have a frolic; and the Dominie was obliged to wink at this propensity. Mr. Worden often nicknamed him Col. Frolic. His frolics might be divided into two classes; viz. the moderate and immoderate. Of the first, he had two or three turns a year; and these were the occasions on which he commonly visited Satanstoe or had my father with him at Rockrockarock, as his own place, in Rockland, was called. On these visits, whether to or from, there was a large consumption of tobacco, beer, cider, wine, rum, lemons, sugar, and the other ingredients of punch, toddy and flip; but no outrageously durable excesses. There was much laughing, a great deal of good feeling, many stories, and regular repetitions of old adventures, in the way of traditional narrations; but nothing that could be called decided excesses. It is true, that my grand father, and my father, and the Rev. Mr. Worden, and Col. Follock, were much in the habit of retiring to their beds a little confused in their brains, the consequence of so much tobacco-smoke, as Mr. Worden always maintained; but everything was decent, and in order. The parson, for instance, invariably pulled up on a Friday; and did not take his place in the circle until Monday evening, again; which gave him fully twenty-four hours, to cool off in, before he ascended the pulpit. I will say this, for Mr. Worden, that he was very systematic and methodical in the observance of all his duties; and I have known him, when he happened to be late at dinner, on discovering that my father had omitted to say grace, insist on everybody's laying down their knives and forks, while he asked a blessing; even though it were after the fish was actually eaten. No, no; Mr. Worden was a particular person, about all such things; and it was generally admitted, that he had been the means of causing grace to be introduced into several families, in Westchester; in which it had never been the practice to have it, before his examples and precepts were known to them.|$|E

5000|$|The {{instrumental}} {{track was}} recorded at Gold Star Studios on January 22, 1966. The session was engineered by Larry Levine and produced by Brian Wilson. It took 21 takes of recording the instrumental track before Brian deemed it the master. The musicians present {{on that day}} were a group of Los Angeles session players {{commonly referred to as}} The Wrecking Crew. Wilson says, [...] "Listen for the rockin' accordions and the ethereal guitars in the introduction. Tony and I had visualized a scene. We had a feeling in our hearts, like a vibration. We put it into music, and it found its way onto tape. We really felt <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> record." [...] During the recording, the two guitarists who played the intro were plugged directly into the mixing board, and no one in the studio could hear them.

[...] Lead singer Dougy Mandagi In addition to the short-lived success of the album, The Temper Trap itself was not received well by music critics, whom mostly gave the album a mixed response. Criticism was mostly aimed at the deviation from the precedent set by Conditions, with reviewers reaching a consensus that this ultimately had a negative impact on the music. For their third studio album, the band felt compelled to return to their traditional roots, after reviewing the response to The Temper Trap. The move was not an acceptance of critics' opinions on The Temper Trap, with lead singer Dougy Mandagi claiming that he was [...] "glad" [...] the band recorded the album. Rather, the move was made in pursuit of matching the success of Conditions, including the popularity of [...] "Sweet Disposition" [...] in particular. Guitarist Joseph Greer described the song as [...] "the catalyst to everything", as it became the standard to which the band began to aim at with their third studio album. Bassist Jonathon Aherne described the feelings of the band, heading into recording their third studio album, as being [...] "under pressure"; a sentiment felt by all members of the band. Aherne was optimistic, however, stating, [...] "as we've discerned and had feedback from album two, and reviewed our strengths from album one, there's a pretty clear vision of what we want to do." ...|$|E

That is what you have to do.” “Not bad,” Tony Stewart said after qualifying fifth. “ (Crew chief) Chad Johnston came over in between the practice session and qualifying and showed me some stuff where I was losing some time. That is what we focused on for qualifying and it worked.” “We were pretty good in that final round but not quite good enough to get the pole there,” said Brad Keselowski after qualifying ninth. “We were missing a little bit in one of the corners, but all-in-all a good effort. We had the fastest car in practice so I feel pretty <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>that.</b> It is similar to what we had at the Brickyard and we were really strong there but just needed a little more to win so I am optimistic about it for sure.” “We really struggled for whatever reason in Turn 1 today,” said Martin Truex, Jr. after qualifying 13th “Just can’t seem to get the balance right. We were either too tight or too loose no matter what we do. Fought the same thing there, not a big deal though I think we will be okay. We’ve got plenty of time to figure it out tomorrow.

40|$|Unemployment isn’t {{going to}} solve itself, argues Nicholas Gruen THE government’s new WorkChoices package of {{industrial}} relations reform will allow workers to negotiate away a range of entitlements. It will make collective bargaining more difficult. And minimum wages will probably increase more slowly. So whose side are you on? The problem is {{the two sides of}} the debate don’t want you to know much about the other side of the story. (In fact one side doesn’t really want you to know much about their own side of the story!) Of course the conservatives - the unions and the ALP - have no trouble telling you what’s bad - the package will eat away at the pay and conditions of lower paid workers. But the radicals - the government - can’t come clean and tell you what’s good about them. Because to do so would involve first, frankly accepting that the conservatives claims are true (if routinely exaggerated) then explaining what might be <b>good</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> (I’ll tell you that in a sec). Instead they’re working from the George Orwell manual of public relations. Step One: Spend tens of millions of your dollars on political ads for policies which are still being refined and have not even been properly specified in draft legislation. Step Two: Remember those chains that burst asunder as the GST gave us mountain of new paperwork? Be similarly bold. Advertise this stripping away of working conditions as a raft of new ‘fairer’ protections for workers. ‘Protected by law’. So what can be said for undermining existing protections for workers? Actually quite a lot. Surprisingly enough, low paid jobs are spread almost evenly through our households, from Redfern and Ipswich to Hamilton and Double Bay. Many low paid workers are young and will be promoted into better jobs. Others have partners who are doing fine. Some are ‘doctors wives’ picking up some spare cash when it doesn’t conflict with tennis parties. Now most economists think that job creation will respond fairly sluggishly to minimum wage falls - but we’re not sure. And if you cut too far the dole becomes more attractive than work. On the other hand minimum wages and conditions are relatively high compared with similar countries. And alarming numbers of workers are simply unable to hold down jobs at those wages and settle for benefits. And in my book the long term unemployment visited upon those who lose heart in the labour market is far more devastating, to themselves their families and communities, than some belt tightening by workers on minimum wages. Tricky isn’t it? Is there a better way? Well yes, there is. We nibble away at a better approach with other policies - like retraining, job subsidies and family tax supplements - to raise worker skills, create entry level jobs and make them more attractive than the dole. But for these policies to really work to mop up the collateral damage from stronger industrial relations regulation - as they do for instance in Scandinavia - they need to aggressively fund them. We don’t do that. Never have. So even though Paul Keating’s ‘Job Compact’ - which guaranteed the unemployed training or a job - and John Howard’s ‘Work for the Dole’ came with the usual ads to make us feel all shiny and new, they’ve always been crippled by under-funding. The cost of the ‘Job Compact’ was contained by restricting it to those who’d rotted on the dole for at least eighteen months. And Work for the Dole was always at least as much a symbol in the ongoing culture war as it was a piece of economic or social policy. The government spends around twice as much on sport. But don’t fall for the line that with falling unemployment the problem is solving itself. Since 1970, and despite the last fifteen years of solid growth, the proportion of working age men without full time work has nearly tripled - to over a million! (Using men tells us more because many women prefer part time work). They’re on the dole, disability payments or part time work. And most of them are unskilled. That astonishing change is driven by the relentless march of cost saving technology. Think word processors, internet banking and big, big machines that lay roads and dig tunnels with just a few people feeding in fuel and materials. And there’s globalisation. Our imports of manufactures are labour intensive whilst our mineral and agricultural exports are capital, resource and skill intensive. For ten years the government’s priorities have focused on tax cuts - with increasing emphasis on those with healthy incomes - rather than subsidising job creation and reducing the ‘effective marginal tax rates’ of sixty per cent plus created by benefits being withdrawn as people move from welfare to work. So while we enjoy the politics of taking sides for or against the IR changes, just remember how few friends those priced out of the labour market really have. Then decide whether you support or oppose the IR changes as best you can. • Nicholas Gruen is Visiting Fellow at ANU and Melbourne University and CEO of Lateral Economics and Peach Discount Mortgage Broking.
