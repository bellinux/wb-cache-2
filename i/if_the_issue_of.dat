5|$|Section 8B(2) {{contained}} an ouster clause that restricted {{the scope of}} judicial review to any question relating to compliance with any procedural requirements of the ISA governing acts or decisions by the President or the Home Affairs Minister. The amendments to the ISA were made retrospective by section 8D, which meant that they applied to judicial review proceedings that had been started before the amendment Act came into force. In addition, the Constitution was amended through the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 to prevent the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 from being challenged as unconstitutional. Article 149(3) was inserted into the Constitution, with the effect that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> whether any executive decision made pursuant to the ISA came before a court (whether before or after this constitutional amendment came into force on 27 January 1989), the court had to decide this issue {{according to the new}} provisions introduced by the 1989 ISA amendments. Article 149(1) was amended to add Articles 11 and 12 to the list of fundamental liberties that the ISA cannot be challenged against, and to extend its immunizing effect to the 1989 ISA amendments.|$|E

500|$|The {{amendments}} to the Constitution {{paved the way for}} intended {{amendments to}} the ISA. The new Article 149(3) stated that <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the validity of any act done or decision made by the President or the Minister for Home Affairs arose in any court proceedings commenced before or after 27 January 1989, it was to be determined in accordance with any law enacted by Parliament for this purpose, and Article 93 of the Constitution could not be relied upon to invalidate such a law. Pursuant to Article 149(3), Parliament then inserted new sections into the ISA. In particular, section 8B(1) confirmed the judgment in Lee Mau Seng by declaring that [...] "the law governing the judicial review of any decision made or act done in pursuance of any power conferred upon the President or the Minister by the provisions of this Act shall be the same as was applicable and declared in Singapore on the 13th day of July 1971; and no part of the law before, on or after that date of {{any other country in the}} Commonwealth relating to judicial review shall apply". In addition, section 8B(1) was made subject to section 8B(2), which seeks to oust judicial review in any court of any act done or decision made by the President or the Minister under the ISA, save where there is any question which relates to compliance with any procedural requirement of the ISA governing such acts or decisions. Jayakumar said in Parliament that section 8B(2) sought not only to prevent the courts from questioning the soundness of the subjective test, but also to anticipate any legal challenges on the basis that the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng only applies to the judicial review of detention orders and not to other acts or decisions under the ISA by the President or Minister, such as suspension directions and revocations of such directions.|$|E

The paper discusses the way in which disabled students define their sexuality as a 'need', but highlights how this view is not shared by those providing assistance. Personal assistants are more inclined to define sexuality as a sexual 'want' and to conflate physical impairment with either asexuality or a limited potential for sexual activity.

An algorithm using line spectra parameter estimation and wavelet based transient detection has been proposed which resolves above issues in computationally efficient manner suitable for implementation in cognitive radio.

40|$|Background. The Dissociative Experiences Scale II (DES-II) is {{the most}} widely used and studied measure on dissociative symptoms. Several authors have argued for some {{necessary}} improvements of the scale. Accordingly, {{a modified version of the}} DES-II was developed, called the Dissociative Experiences Scale II Clinical Version (DES-II-CV). Objective. This study will explore the DES-II-CV by examining associations between dissociative symptoms and childhood maltreatment trauma, post-traumatic stress symptoms, symptoms of general psychological distress, and substance abuse characteristics in a sample of substance abusers. The hope is that findings may generate new research questions and spur further interest in the DES-II-CV. Results. There was limited support for a relationship between dissociative symptoms and the variables of interest, and effects sizes were generally small. Emotional abuse and post-traumatic stress symptoms was found to be related to higher levels of non-pathological dissociative experiences. Conclusion. The lacking support for a dissociation – childhood maltreatment trauma relationship suggest that our sample may use substances to achieve dissociative like states. The relationship found between childhood emotional abuse and non-pathological dissociative symptoms, as well as other finding within this study, may reflect some <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>issues</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scale.

6000|$|The great defect of {{that fine}} {{intelligence}} {{is a failure}} to grasp and enjoy the things commonly called convention and tradition; which are foods upon which all human creatures must feed frequently {{if they are to}} live. Very few modern people of course have any idea of what they are. [...] "Convention" [...] is very nearly the same word as [...] "democracy." [...] It has again and again in history been used as an alternative word to Parliament. So far from suggesting anything stale or sober, the word convention rather conveys a hubbub; it is the coming together of men; every mob is a convention. In its secondary sense it means the common soul of such a crowd, its instinctive anger at the traitor or its instinctive salutation of the flag. Conventions may be cruel, they may be unsuitable, they may even be grossly superstitious or obscene; but {{there is one thing that}} they never are. Conventions are never dead. They are always full of accumulated emotions, the piled-up and passionate experiences of many generations asserting what they could not explain. To be inside any true convention, as the Chinese respect for parents or the European respect for children, is to be surrounded by something which whatever else it is is not leaden, lifeless or automatic, something which is taut and tingling with vitality at a hundred points, which is sensitive almost to madness and which is so much alive that it can kill. Now Bernard Shaw has always made this one immense mistake (arising out of that bad progressive education of his), the mistake of treating convention as a dead thing; treating it as if it were a mere physical environment like the pavement or the rain. Whereas it is a result of will; a rain of blessings and a pavement of good intentions. Let it be remembered that I am not discussing in what degree one should allow for tradition; I am saying that men like Shaw do not allow for it at all. If Shaw had found in early life that he was contradicted by Bradshaw's Railway Guide or even by the Encyclopædia Britannica, he would have felt at least that he might be wrong. But if he had found himself contradicted by his father and mother, he would have thought it all the more probable that he was right. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>issue</b> <b>of</b> the last evening paper contradicted him he might be troubled to investigate or explain. That the human tradition of two thousand years contradicted him did not trouble him for an instant. That Marx was not with him was important. That Man was not with him was an irrelevant prehistoric joke. People have talked far too much about the paradoxes of Bernard Shaw. Perhaps his only pure paradox is this almost unconscious one; that he has tended to think that because something has satisfied generations of men it must be untrue.|$|E
