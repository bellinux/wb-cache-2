40|$|By {{measuring}} the {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) 1 /T_ 1 relaxation rate in the Br (bond) doped DTN compound, Ni(Cl(1 -x) Br_x) 2 - 4 SC(NH 2) 2 (DTNX), we show that the low-energy spin dynamics of its high magnetic field "Bose-glass" regime is dominated by a strong peak of spin fluctuations found at the nearly doping-independent position H* = 13. 6 T. From its temperature and field dependence we conclude that this corresponds to a level crossing of the energy levels related to the doping-induced impurity states. Observation of the local NMR signal from the spin adjacent to the doped Br allowed us to fully characterize this impurity state. We have thus quantified a microscopic theoretical model that paves the way to {{better understanding of the}} Bose-glass physics in DTNX, as revealed in the related theoretical study [M. <b>Dupont,</b> <b>S.</b> Capponi, and N.

Building on nuclear magnetic resonance experiments at high magnetic field [A. Orlova et al., Phys. Rev.

Going beyond single impurity localization we use quantum Monte Carlo simulations to explore many-body effects from which pairwise effective interactions lead to a (impurity-induced) BEC revival [M. <b>Dupont,</b> <b>S.</b> Capponi, and N.

The global magnetic field-temperature phase diagram of DTNX reveals a very rich structure for low impurity concentration, with consecutive disorder-induced BEC mini-domes separated by intervening many-body localized BG regimes. Upon increasing the impurity level, multiple mini-BEC phases start to overlap, while intermediate BG regions vanish. Comment: 16 pages, 13 figure...|$|R

J. : “Potential for rescue from future ocean acidification by extant physiological differences among distinct Arctic copepod populations”. (Manuscript). Uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2) into the world’s oceans is increasing seawater acidity in a process termed ocean acidification. This is predicted to have harmful effects {{on a variety of}} marine organisms. With the greatest and fastest changes in pH expected to occur the Arctic seas over the next 100 years, the need for understanding the effects of low pH on Arctic marine organisms is pressing. This thesis examines the effects of projected levels of ocean acidification on the physiology of a key component of the Arctic marine ecosystem, the copepod Calanus glacialis, using molecular, organismal, and evolutionary methodologies to investigate the effects of low pH throughout its lifespan, in combination with other stressors (food availability) and across geographically distant sub-populations (to predict their capacity for adaptation or acclimation in the future). Young stages of the copepod, potentially the most sensitive, were tolerant to realistic pH levels for future ocean acidification: the nauplii developed successfully from egg to naupliar stage N 6 at all four pH treatments investigated (pH 7. 5, 7, 7, 7. 9 and 8. 05). Gene expression N 6 nauplii supported the organismal-level tolerance observed, indicating only mild gene expression and no stress response to low pH. Detrimental effects were found, however, in the young copepodite stages (C 2 -C 4), which indicated an energetic cost at low pH. However, differences in this response between geographically distant, and potentially genetically isolated sub-populations showed that those that lived in a low pH environment tolerated it better, indicating that C. glacialis may be able to alleviate these detrimental effects over time. C. glacialis populations face a myriad of environmental changes driven by global warming and ocean acidification in the Arctic, and while they may experience declines due to the interactions of these multiple stressors, they likely will not experience declines primarily due to ocean acidification...|$|R

40|$|Determining {{effective}} {{cleaning and}} disinfection regimes of livestock housing is vital to improving the health of resident animals and reducing zoonotic disease. A cleaning regime consisting of scraping, soaking with or without detergent (treatment and control), pressure washing, disinfection and natural drying was applied to multiple pig pens. After each cleaning stage, samples were taken from different materials and enumerated for total aerobic count (TAC) and Enterobacteriaceae (ENT). Soaking with detergent (Blast-Off, Biolink) caused significantly greater reductions of TAC and ENT on metal, and TAC on concrete, compared with control. Disinfection effect (Virkon <b>S,</b> <b>DuPont)</b> was not significantly associated with prior detergent treatment. Disinfection significantly reduced TAC and ENT on concrete and stock board but not on metal. Twenty-four hours after disinfection TAC and ENT on metal and stock board were significantly reduced, but no significant reductions occurred in the subsequent 96  hours. Counts on concrete did not significantly reduce during the entire drying period (120  hours).

Many of the fundamental principles for storage and retrieval of technical information developed in the 1960 s, including representations of atom-bond-atom structure and a thesaurus, were adopted and are still in use. These innovations resulted in the Scientific Corporate Information Online (SCION) database created in the early 1990 s, which provides online access for DuPont’s scientific community to proprietary technical information.

40|$|The {{development}} of horticulture on the Peirce property is significant both in its historical aspects {{and in its}} relation to the subsequent {{development of}} Longwood Gardens. The original land grant to George Pearce in 1700 {{marked the beginning of}} a horticultural history which developed in varying degrees under numerous owners until its final purchase in 1906 by Pierre <b>S.</b> <b>duPont.</b> The original grant from William Penn to George Pearce on December 14, 1700, conveyed 402 acres and 54 perches in East Marlborough Township. This land was developed for agricultural purposes [...] first by his son Joshua and later by his grandson Caleb. Samuel and Joshua Peirce, great-grandsons of George Pearce, received approximately 189 acres of the original Penn grant. In the year 1789 they began to plant a portion of this property as an arboretum and thereby began the development of Peirce’s Park. By the year 1830 they had one of the finest collections of woody plant materials of any park or arboretum in the country. They associated with several important botanists {{during the early years of}} the nineteenth century, including Josiah Hoopes, Humphrey Marshall, and Dr. William Darlington. Plant materials found on the property were mentioned in several publications such as Flora Cestrica by William Darlington in 1837, the American Handbook of Ornamental Trees by Thomas Meehan in 1853, and the Book of Evergreens by Josiah Hoopes in 1868. After the death of Joshua Peirce in 1851, the Park passed into the hands of his son George W. Peirce. During the time of his ownership there was more emphasis on the Park as a place for social gatherings than for scientific effort, and it became known and appreciated as a place for picnicking and other outdoor activities. After the death of George W. Peirce in 1880, the ownership of the property was held by the nine children of his sister Mary Ann Peirce Stebbins. This division marked the beginning of a decline which continued through subsequent transfers of Park ownership to various individuals. Finally in 1906, the ultimate and complete destruction of the Park seemed inevitable with the signing of an agreement between the then-owner, Lydia V. Bevan, and a Lancaster lumber company. This agreement granted permission for trees on the property to be cut and used for lumber production. In an effort to save the trees from destruction, Pierre <b>S.</b> <b>duPont</b> bought the property in 1906. This purchase marked the beginning of a new horticultural and social era on the Peirce property with the development of Longwood Gardens. The heritage of the Peirce family and their development of the Park provided the impetus for this new growth and is now an integral part of modern-day Longwood...|$|R
