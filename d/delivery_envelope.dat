50|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} for Fleischer Studios was the 18 month <b>delivery</b> <b>envelope,</b> coming {{at a time when}} Fleischer Studios was relocating to Miami, Florida. While Snow White was in production for 18 months, it had been in development for just as long, allowing for a total of three years to reach the screen. To meet this deadline, the Fleischer staff was greatly expanded to some 800 employees. Animation training classes were set up with Miami art schools as a conduit for additional workers. Experienced lead animators were lured from Hollywood studios, including Nelson Demorest, Joe D'Igalo, and former Fleischer Animators Grim Natwick, Al Eugster, and Shamus Culhane, who returned after working for the Walt Disney Studios.|$|E
5000|$|Demolition expert D.O. Guerrero (Van Heflin), down on {{his luck}} and {{with a history of}} mental illness, buys life {{insurance}} with the intent of committing suicide by blowing up the plane. He plans to set off a bomb in an attaché case while over the Atlantic so that his wife, Inez (Maureen Stapleton), will collect the insurance money of $225,000. His erratic behavior at the airport, including using his last cash to buy the insurance policy and mistaking a Customs officer for an airline ramp agent, attracts airport officials' attention. Guerrero's wife finds a Special <b>Delivery</b> <b>envelope</b> from a travel agency and, realizing her husband might be doing something desperate, goes to the airport to try to dissuade him. She informs airport officials that he had been fired from a construction job for [...] "misplacing" [...] explosives and that the family's financial situation was desperate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Studies of {{the effects}} of {{environmental}} interventions on physical activity should include valid measures of physical activity before and after the intervention. Baseline data collection can be difficult when the timetable for introduction of an intervention is outside researchers’ control. This paper reports and reflects on the practical issues, challenges and results of rapid baseline objective physical activity measurement using accelerometers distributed by post in a natural experimental study. Methods A sample of working adults enrolling for the Commuting and Health in Cambridge study and expressing willingness to wear an activity monitor was selected to undertake baseline accelerometer assessment. Each selected participant received a study pack by post containing the core study questionnaire and an accelerometer to wear for seven consecutive days, and was asked to return their accelerometer and completed questionnaire in person or by post using the prepaid special <b>delivery</b> <b>envelope</b> provided. If a pack was not returned within two weeks of issue, a reminder was sent to the participant. Each participant received up to five reminders by various methods including letter, email, telephone and letter sent by recorded delivery. Results 95 % of participants registering for the study were willing in principle to undertake accelerometer assessment. Using a pool of 221 accelerometers, we achieved a total of 714 issues of accelerometers to participants during a six month period. 116 (16 %) participants declined to use the accelerometer after receiving it. Three accelerometers failed, 45 (6 % of 714) were lost and many were returned with insufficient data recorded, resulted in 109 (15 %) participants re-wearing their accelerometer for a second week of measurement. 550 (77 %) participants completed data collection, 478 (87 % of 550) to the required standard. A total of 694 reminders were issued to retrieve unreturned accelerometers. More than 90 % of accelerometers were retrieved after a maximum of two reminders. Conclusions It is feasible to use accelerometers to collect baseline objective physical activity data by post from a large number of participants in a limited time period. However, a substantial pool of devices is required and researchers need to be prepared to make significant efforts to recover some of the devices. </p...|$|E

50|$|The {{post office}} was {{established}} as Wells on August 20, 1886, and {{named for its}} first postmaster, Richard M. Wells, according to Kentucky Place Names by Richard M. Rennick. It was closed in 1894, but reopened on November 4, 1898 as Tomahawk for The Tomahawk News, a newspaper then being published in Inez. It now has an estimated population of 1,000, based on voter registration in the Tomahawk precinct. The post office survived in 1975 when the U.S. Postal Service closed nearby offices in Milo and Davisport. In 2012, {{as part of the}} Postal Service's nationwide reorganization, the full-time post office building at the forks of Rockcastle Creek and Stafford Fork was closed. But the community retained its name, Zip Code (41262) and some services after it was designated as Kentucky's first Village Post Office. As such, the facility provides free-standing post-office boxes and a mail drop box beside a convenience store, which is authorized to sell stamps and <b>delivery</b> <b>envelopes.</b>|$|R

40|$|The St. Jude Children 2 ̆ 7 s Research Hospital (St. Jude) HIV- 1 vaccine {{program is}} based on the {{observation}} that multiple, antigenically distinct HIV- 1 envelope protein structures are capable of mediating HIV- 1 infection. A cocktail vaccine comprising representatives of these diverse structures (immunotypes) is therefore considered necessary to elicit lymphocyte populations that prevent HIV- 1 infection. This strategy is reminiscent of that used to design a currently licensed and successful 23 -valent pneumococcus vaccine. Three recombinant vector systems are used for the <b>delivery</b> of <b>envelope</b> cocktails (DNA, vaccinia virus, and purified protein) and each of these has been tested individually in phase I safety trials. A fourth clinical trial, in which diverse envelopes and vectors are combined in a prime-boost vaccination regimen, has been FDA-approved and is expected to commence in 2007.

5000|$|In his proposal, Hill {{also called}} for {{official}} pre-printed envelopes and adhesive postage stamps as alternative ways of getting the sender to pay for postage, {{at a time when}} prepayment was optional. Previously, postage had depended on distance and the number of sheets of paper; now, one penny would assure <b>delivery</b> of an <b>envelope</b> and the letter it enclosed anywhere in the country provided together they satisfied the weight condition. This was a lower rate than before, when the cost of postage was usually more than 4d (four pence). The reform did not settle the issue of who paid for the postage, as it still remained optional {{for a number of years}} in spite of Hill's efforts as Secretary to the Post Office to alter the situation.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe are {{investigating}} {{canine distemper virus}} (CDV) as a vaccine vector for the <b>delivery</b> of HIV <b>envelope</b> (Env) that closely resembles the native trimeric spike. We selected CDV because it will promote vaccine delivery to lymphoid tissues, and because human exposure is infrequent, reducing potential effects of pre-existing immunity. Using SIV Env as a model, we tested a number of vector and gene insert designs. Vectors containing a gene inserted between the CDV H and L genes, which encoded Env lacking most of its cytoplasmic tail, propagated efficiently in Vero cells, expressed the immunogen on the cell surface, and incorporated the SIV glycoprotein into progeny virus particles. When ferrets were vaccinated intranasally, {{there were no signs}} of distress, vector replication was observed in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues, and the animals produced anti-SIV Env antibodies. These data show that live CDV-SIV Env vectors can safely induce anti-Env immune responses following intranasal vaccination...|$|R
50|$|Banner {{reveals that}} Gertrude was {{being forced to}} help Lockyear with his murder plot. Lockyear was a Communist agent, and Gertrude's {{mother and father were}} stuck in East Germany. Lockyear claimed he could get them out, but {{threatened}} to have them killed unless she helped him. Using a tape recorder, Lockyear recorded three minutes of silence, then fired three shots with the Tokarev, then recorded more silence. The day he killed Gosling, Lockyear arranged for the <b>delivery</b> of an <b>envelope</b> containing a toy gun to Gertrude's desk. He then went to the legation with a briefcase that had an identical empty envelope in it, and a silenced Tokarev. He stalled Gosling until a time as close to 11:30 as possible, then shot him and started the tape recording. Lockyear sealed the gun into the empty envelope. As Lockyear left, he put his briefcase on Gertrude's desk, holding the envelope against it. He picked the other envelope on Gertrude's desk up and replaced it with the envelope holding the real gun. After the shots on the tape recording were heard, when everyone was examining Gosling's body, Gertrude shut off the tape recorder. She had drawn the two circles to draw attention to a reel of recording tape. Lockyear killed her, thinking she had already destroyed the tape.|$|R
40|$|KSHV, also {{referred}} to as human herpesvirus- 8 (HHV- 8), is the eighth and latest identified human herpesvirus. It is the causative agent for a variety of malignancies namely Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD). The processes and mechanisms involved in virus entry are among the many intricacies not fully understood regarding KSHV and other viruses. As in other herpesviruses, KSHV target cell entry is a complex process consisting of multiple steps which include: initial attachment/binding to the cell, virus:cell surface receptor interactions, virus internalization/uptake, and subsequent trafficking of the virus for nuclear <b>delivery.</b> Viral <b>envelope</b> glycoproteins interact with target cell surface receptor molecules to facilitate entry into cells. For instance, virus envelope associated glycoprotein B (gB) of KSHV is known to interact with integrins via its RGD (Arg-Gly-Asp; 27 - 29 aa) integrin binding domain. RGD of KSHV functionally interacts with integrins α 3 β 1, αVβ 3, and αVβ 5 that have a role in initiating internalization. Cell surface receptors, like integrins, aid in a virus’ ability to establish a successful infection. In addition to RGD, KSHV gB also harbors the lesser studied integrin recognition motif, disintegrin-like domain (DLD; 66 - 85 aa). As it pertains to virus entry in general, few studies have sought to establish a role for DLD, which is highly conserved among gB homologs. In the following studies, we employed phage display peptide library screening and recombinant viruses to determine that DLD of KSHV gB binds α 9 β 1 integrin on the surface of target cells in an interaction critical for infection. We go on to specify a role for DLD-binding α 9 β 1 in mediating KSHV entry by employing subcellular fractionation. The virus interactions with α 9 β 1 are crucial for endosomal trafficking of KSHV, as integrin α 9 β 1 was observed to have a role in late endosomal escape of KSHV for cytosolic delivery. These studies provide new insights in regards to KSHV infectious entry into target cells. Advancing our knowledge of virus entry is critical for a thorough understanding of KSHV pathogenesis...|$|R
5000|$|The company started {{overnight}} {{operations on}} April 17, 1973, with fourteen Dassault Falcon 20s that connected twenty-five {{cities in the}} United States. Fred Smith's childhood friend, John Fry of Ardent Studios, sent Ardent partner Terry Manning to the Federal Express home office on Democrat Road near the Memphis Airport with the first package {{to be put into}} the system. That night, 186 packages were carried. Services included both overnight and two-day package and <b>envelope</b> <b>delivery</b> services, as well as Courier Pak. Federal Express began to market itself as [...] "the freight service company with 550-mile-per-hour delivery trucks". However, the company began to experience financial difficulties, losing up to a million USD a month. While waiting for a flight home to Memphis from Chicago after being turned down for capital by General Dynamics, Smith impulsively hopped a flight to Las Vegas, where he won $27,000 playing blackjack. The winnings enabled the cash-strapped company to meet payroll the following Monday. [...] "The $27,000 wasn’t decisive, but it was an omen that things would get better," [...] Smith says. In the end, he raised somewhere between $50 and $70 million, from twenty of the USA'sleading risk venture speculators, including such companies as the First National City Bank of New York and the Bank of America in California. At the time, Federal Express was the most highly financed new company in U.S. history, in terms of venture capital.|$|R
40|$|Non-viral gene {{delivery}} is plagued by low transfection levels compared to viral <b>delivery.</b> The nuclear <b>envelope</b> presents a significant obstacle for non-viral vectors. A peptide-based nuclear localizing sequence has {{been incorporated into}} non-viral vectors to traverse the nuclear envelope. Here, we selected a photo-chemical method for covalently labeling the peptide onto plasmid DNA. The hypothesis of this work was to incorporate a nuclear localizing sequence into a non-viral delivery vector, demonstrate increased nuclear uptake and show a subsequent increase in transgene expression both in vitro and in vivo. We focused on pursuing in vitro and in vivo methods by which to test non-viral vectors for increases in gene expression based on the nuclear localizing sequence. Hydrodynamic dosing and intramuscular dosing (followed by electroporation) are two efficient delivery routes for dosing DNA in vivo. Through preliminary experiments, we became confident that whole animal bioluminescent imaging was a reliable and quantitative method by which to detect luciferase expression by either delivery route. Moving forward, both hydrodynamic and intramuscular dosing {{would be used to}} test formulations for nuclear localizing ability in vivo. Nuclear localizing peptides containing a photo-activatable functionality were synthesized and characterized. We quantitatively explored the photo-labeling capabilities on plasmid DNA via a radioactive peptide. In vitro, tissue culture-based experiments were carried out to show increased nuclear uptake by confocal microscopy as well as increased transgene expression. Throughout the literature, achieving an increase in expression by incorporating a nuclear localizing sequence into a non-viral vector has been elusive. The complexity of achieving this goal is increased when considering an in vivo system for improving gene transfer efficiency. Several strategies have been explored to demonstrate an increase in reporter gene expression from this type of non-viral vector, and the methods developed herein can be applied to other nuclear localizing vectors...|$|R
40|$|There is, currently, {{considerable}} {{evidence of}} confusion and conflict within the profession of architecture. This conflict stems from three major factors. These are: i) The Technological Age ii) The Complexity of Problems iii) The Client. Each of these is examined; the conclusion being that for architecture to develop, defined Process or Method is needed. Scientific Method is then examined to find the roots of Process. The argument is that architecture can, and must, learn Method or Process from the Technologies. The conclusion is that for any Process, {{the first step is}} the initial definition of the problem. This problem statement (with respect to Architecture) is difficult, since it involves non-quantifiable goals statements and concepts. The Process whereby this Problem Statement is achieved has been defined as Programming. This definition involves Areas of Concern and results in Criteria for Programming, which are: a) Flexibility b) Feedback c) Experience d) Communication These criteria are then used for evaluation of the Case Study. The first part of the case study examines, in detail, the Programming process of a large architectural firm. Part two examines four other Programming Processes, in less detail. The study is then evaluated by re-stating the definition of Programming, and describing various potential uses of Programming and concludes in the statement of two over-riding considerations for Programming. These are:- 1) The Statement of the Problem is the product of Programming. 2) Programming and Design are Processes within an overall Project <b>Delivery</b> System.
