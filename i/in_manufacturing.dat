40|$|This {{research}} {{develops a}} framework to guide practitioners {{through the process}} of implementing Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing</b> <b>in</b> the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry. The scope of Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing</b> is determined through an analysis of its evolution and current use. Current approaches to its implementation are reviewed and shortcomings are identified. A requirement to allow practitioners to tailor the approach to the implementation of Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing,</b> according to the context of the particular manufacturing system, is endorsed. Three case studies of Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing</b> implementation within the commercial aircraft manufacturing industry, conducted as part of this research, are presented and analysed. The benefits of Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing</b> implementation <b>in</b> the cases are shown to be signficant and immediately apparent. Two key factors in the implementation of Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing</b> are identified. These are the concepts of perceived opportunity for improvement and distributed support for implementation. These concepts are supported by other researchers. They form the basis of the practical framework to guide the implementation of Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing.</b> The framework combines the concepts with existing research in the areas of: strategy formulation; performance measure selection; target setting; the nominal group technique; and, literature on the techniques of Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing.</b> The framework provides a novel and reliable mechanism that allows a practitioner to identify which of many potential approaches towards Just <b>In</b> Time <b>manufacturing</b> should be taken. This is achieved using the detailed mechanisms presented in the framework to evaluate the perceived opportunity and distributed support...|$|R

5|$|Fortunately for {{the future}} of the Spitfire, many of the {{production}} jigs and machine tools had already been relocated by 20 September, and steps were being taken to disperse production to small facilities throughout the Southampton area.

A purpose-built works, specialising <b>in</b> <b>manufacturing</b> fuselages and installing engines, was built at Star Road, Caversham in Reading. The drawing office in which all Spitfire designs were drafted was relocated to Hursley Park, near Southampton. This site also had an aircraft assembly hangar where many prototype and experimental Spitfires were assembled, but since it had no associated aerodrome no Spitfires ever flew from Hursley.|$|E

40|$|Optimizing {{flexible}} routing <b>in</b> flexible <b>manufacturing</b> {{systems is}} one of the aspects that increase the efficiency of flexible <b>manufacturing</b> systems especially <b>in</b> dynamic environment systems. This article presents a multistage approach to solve flexible routing problem <b>in</b> flexible <b>manufacturing</b> systems. Multistage approach includes three stages; the first stage is a production simulation system to find the fitness of the flexible manufacturing systems corresponding to different products’ routes’ groups. The second stage proposes an artificial neural network approach to predict the products’ routes’ group <b>in</b> flexible <b>manufacturing</b> systems. The last stage combines genetic algorithms and artificial neural network to optimize proper routes for all product types <b>in</b> flexible <b>manufacturing</b> systems. Multistage approach proposed in this study aims to reduce the computational time required to obtain and optimize the flexible routes <b>in</b> flexible <b>manufacturing</b> systems. The results of this study show that the artificial neural network can be used efficiently to predict the flexible routes <b>in</b> flexible <b>manufacturing</b> systems and it reduces the computational time for routes’ optimization required with production simulation system. This characteristic improves the flexibility of flexible manufacturing systems since it can be adapted frequently against any change in production ratios...|$|R
