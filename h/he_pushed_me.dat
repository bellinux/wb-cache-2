500|$|Massa's {{touch on}} Hamilton's car on lap two was {{labelled}} by the McLaren driver [...] "as deliberate {{as it could}} be". Massa rejected the allegation, saying [...] "I had two wheels on the gravel. I could not stop the car and I was on the gravel because <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> into the gravel." [...] Media coverage of the incident suggested that though the contact was Massa's fault, it was unintentional. Simon Arron, writing for The Daily Telegraph, said Hamilton's accusation of deliberate contact was [...] "unworthy and unwise", adding that the contact was simply a racing incident. The gap between the drivers in the Drivers' Championship after the race stood at five points, in Hamilton's favour, with two races remaining. In the Constructors' Championship, McLaren's failure to score points, combined with Ferrari's third and seventh, moved Ferrari to a seven-point lead.|$|E
2500|$|... "Doug {{looked at}} me," [...] {{continued}} Amos, [...] "it was March– and he said, 'I'm 70, and I {{want you to}} do this. You can do this. You’ve been doing this your whole life.' He inspired me. He’s been able to have these conversations with me since the mid ’80s. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> to start writing Little Earthquakes, so he’s been in my life for so long. (Before July of last year), I hadn’t seen him for 14 years. And even though he’s 70, he’s as sharp as he ever was.|$|E
2500|$|In Campo: Still Entertaining Campese {{reflects}} that, [...] "As chance {{would have}} it, Jonah {{got the ball}} in the opening stages of the second half and ran straight at me… I think I shut my eyes, but I tackled him. Later in the half <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> aside to score a try, but I could at least claim to have cut him down once." [...] Following the Test Campese and Lomu met in the changing rooms and exchanged their jerseys. Lomu gave Campese his number 11 jersey while Campese gave Lomu his number 16 jersey. Campese's 92nd Test marked the last Test he would play in the amateur era.|$|E
6000|$|... "You have a {{pleasant}} room," [...] I remark, and look {{about a little}} disconcerted {{because there is no}} fireplace for me to put my back against, or hearthrug to stand upon. <b>He</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>me</b> a chair, into which I plump, and we hang over an immensity of conversational possibilities.|$|R
5000|$|David Harbour {{has been}} {{extremely}} important to me musically and personally. <b>He</b> has <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> to places I didn't know I could reach ... He is a true force of talent that is beyond my realm ....it doesn't end with Metal. Stay tune to his page. Leather Leone ...|$|R
6000|$|I'll lay {{the whole}} thing bare. [...] You saw the luck that he had when <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> in past <b>me</b> there. [...] Does {{anything}} stir on the sea? ...|$|R
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
60|$|His {{pale face}} turned red with anger; <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> away from him.|$|E
60|$|He {{staggered}} blindly {{towards the}} door. I rushed after him, piteously calling him back, but <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> off roughly and hurried out.|$|E
50|$|I thought {{initially}} I {{should get}} a new producer, {{but in the end}} there were so many other new things going on—new sound, new band. I figured I needed something more stable. He knows what he can extract from me. I've never met anyone so patient as Lindsey. He doesn't let me get away with anything. <b>He</b> always <b>pushes</b> <b>me,</b> even though we're mates. It was a very intimate working relationship.|$|R
5000|$|Jill Harth {{alleges that}} Trump {{assaulted}} her several times. Harth {{has stated that}} in December 1992, while dining with Trump and her then-boyfriend George Houraney, Trump attempted to put his hands between her legs. Harth and Houraney visited Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in January 1993 for a contract-signing celebration. Trump, according to Harth, offered her a tour before pulling her into the empty bedroom of his daughter Ivanka. [...] "I was admiring the decoration, and next thing I know <b>he's</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>me</b> against a wall and has his hands all over me. He was trying to kiss me. I was freaking out." [...] Harth says she desperately protested against Trump's advances, and eventually managed {{to run out of}} the room. She and her boyfriend left rather than stay the night, as they had intended. After she became engaged, Harth alleges, Trump began to stalk her.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> by <b>me,</b> in his turn. I {{followed}} him close. We entered the house, and called again. Again {{there was no}} answer. We looked into the little sitting-room {{on one side of}} the passage, and into the dining-room on the other. Both were empty. We went on to the back of the house, where the room was situated which Oscar called his workshop. When we tried the door of the workshop it was locked.|$|R
6000|$|... "You’re {{all being}} made fools of," [...] he said, {{getting up and}} stamping. [...] "I tell you <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> over-board for the purpose." ...|$|E
60|$|He took my hand, {{but as he}} did so <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> {{back into}} the shadow from which I had stepped to proffer it him.|$|E
60|$|He entirely omitted {{the usual}} formal salutation {{as we entered}} the {{presence}} of the jeddak, and as <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> roughly before the ruler he exclaimed in a loud and menacing voice.|$|E
5000|$|After the fight, Galento was unconsolable. Whitey Bimstein, acting cut man: [...] "...he {{is sitting}} there with blood pouring from his eyes, his nose and his cheek. He won't let me touch the cuts. He won't let me take off his gloves <b>He</b> <b>pushes</b> <b>me</b> away every time I try to do {{something}} for him, and bellows, 'You guys wouldn't let me fight my own fight. I'd've knocked that mug cold.'" [...] Galento contended throughout life, that his trainers convinced him to change styles, and to fight cleanly; he regretted he did not fight [...] "his" [...] fight and foul Louis. Only a year after the Louis fight, Bimstein offered a different perspective, asserting the bob and weave Tony adopted in the first two rounds was working, citing the knockdown of Louis in the second frame as proof. [...] "Then (Galento) thought he was John L. Sullivan, and came up straight to slug," [...] said Bimstein, [...] "and you just can't do that with Louis." ...|$|R
60|$|He did not answer, but {{twisted and}} struggled, and before I {{knew what he}} was doing <b>he</b> had <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> off the stone step into a tangle of {{blackened}} beams behind. I dropped his arm to save myself, and it was mere good fortune that I did not break an ankle in the fall. When I had gained the step again he was gone after the man, and a portly citizen stood in front of me, looking into the doorway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Finally, backing to the opening, <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> out to <b>me</b> {{between the}} bars his wrists, lashed with many turns of rope. His hands, very swollen, with knotted veins, looked {{enormous}} and unwieldy. I saw his bent back. It was very broad. His voice {{was like the}} muttering of a bull.|$|R
60|$|We went out. As I {{passed him}} at the door, I saw, to my astonishment and fright, that he was deadly pale. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> hastily into the open air, {{and closed the door}} upon us. Only upon us two.|$|E
6000|$|The keeper {{laughed a}} low laugh of vulgar incredulity. [...] "Why, there's {{a pair of}} you, I do believe," [...] he said. [...] "You're just as mad {{yourself}} as t'other one." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> aside roughly to get at his charge.|$|E
60|$|It was Theodore who {{had removed}} the cloth from my face. As soon as I had {{recovered}} my breath I made a rush for him, for I wanted to strangle him. But M. Arthur Geoffroy was too quick and {{too strong for}} me. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> back into the chair.|$|E
5000|$|Tarantino {{encouraged}} Makhdomi to both {{pursue an}} acting career and adopt the shorter stage name, Omar Doom. Doom was not pursuing acting at the time. Instead, {{he was working}} as a musician and a co-running a clothing line, called Diabla, with one of his sisters, Saira. Following Tarantinos advice, Doom began studying acting. In an interview during a press junket in Berlin for Inglourious Basterds, Doom described Tarantinos encouragement, [...] "Quentin told me Id be great in movies. <b>He</b> really <b>pushed</b> <b>me.</b> I decided to go for it. I took his advice, and studied acting.|$|R
6000|$|Dr. Sterndale {{drew from}} his pocket a paper packet and laid it upon the table. On the outside was written [...] "Radix pedis diaboli" [...] with a red poison label beneath it. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> it towards <b>me.</b> [...] "I {{understand}} {{that you are a}} doctor, sir. Have you ever heard of this preparation?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Stoynoff {{described}} the alleged episode, [...] "We walked into that room alone, and Trump {{shut the door}} behind us. I turned around, and within seconds <b>he</b> was <b>pushing</b> <b>me</b> against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat... I was stunned. And I was grateful when Trumps longtime butler burst into the room a minute later, as I tried to unpin myself." [...] Stoynoff composed herself and conducted the interview, after which she said Trump repeatedly told her, [...] "Were going to have an affair, Im telling you." [...] Melania was also interviewed for that article.|$|R
60|$|The {{next friend}} whose {{acquaintance}} I renewed was Dan. He occupied chambers in the Temple, and one evening {{a week or}} two after the 'Ortensia marriage, I called upon him. Nothing in his manner of greeting me suggested the necessity of explanation. Dan never demanded anything of his friends beyond their need of him. Shaking hands with me, <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> down into the easy-chair, and standing {{with his back to the}} fire, filled and lighted his pipe.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Them two clever ones had him {{all alone}} to themselves. Jeremiah come a dancing at me {{sideways}}, after I had let you out (he always comes a dancing at me sideways when he's {{going to hurt}} me), {{and he said to}} me, [...] "Now, Affery," [...] he said, [...] "I am a coming behind you, my woman, and a going to run you up." [...] So he took and squeezed {{the back of my neck}} in his hand, till it made me open MY mouth, and then <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> before him to bed, squeezing all the way. That's what he calls running me up, he do. Oh, he's a wicked one!' ...|$|E
60|$|A {{quick look}} of {{intelligence}} passed between us, after which I kept my eyes {{turned away from}} the warrior and did not look at him again, for fear that I might arouse the suspicion of the Okarians. When we reached the edge of the pit I saw that it was very deep, and presently I realized I was soon to judge just how far it extended {{below the surface of the}} court, for he who held the rope passed it about my body in such a way that it could be released from above at any time; and then, as all the warriors grasped it, <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> forward, and I fell into the yawning abyss.|$|E
5000|$|Weatherly {{said that}} he had {{initially}} been reluctant to join a JAG spin-off and explained, [...] "But I went and had this dinner with Don Bellisario in Australia and his personality, his storytelling and his presence and everything kind of won me over." [...] He later commented, [...] "I got very lucky with Don Bellisario. He directed two of the first three episodes, and <b>he</b> really <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> to try things and experiment and some of the wacky comedy came out of that. And it was kind of unexpected and I didn't really know what I was going to find." ...|$|R
500|$|Two {{notes were}} found {{in a pile of}} rubbish by Phagan's head, and became known as the [...] "murder notes". One said: [...] "he said he wood love me land down play like the night witch did it but that long tall black negro did boy his slef." [...] The other said, [...] "mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and <b>he</b> <b>push</b> <b>me</b> down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me." [...] The phrase [...] "night witch" [...] was thought to mean [...] "night watch"; when the notes were {{initially}} read aloud, night watchman Newt Lee is reported by police to have said, [...] "Boss, it looks like they are trying to lay it on me" [...] (or words to that effect). Lee was arrested that morning based on these notes and his apparent familiarity with the bodyhe stated that the girl was white when the police, because of the filth and darkness in the basement, initially thought she was black. A trail leading back to the elevator suggested to police that the body had been moved by Lee.|$|R
6000|$|... "Great soft-head," [...] {{reflected}} Greta, as {{she watched}} his retreating form, [...] "he knew I was telling lies, why didn't <b>he</b> <b>push</b> past <b>me,</b> or--do anything. Ah! Mynheer Dirk, {{if you are not}} careful that Spaniard will take your wind. Well, he is more amusing, that's certain. I am tired of these duck-footed Leydeners, who daren't wink at a donkey lest he should bray, and among such holy folk somebody a little wicked is rather a change." [...] Then Greta, who, it may be remembered, came from Brussels, and had French blood in her veins, went upstairs to make a report to her mistress, telling her all that passed.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes I said to myself, {{this is an}} enchantment, and I must strive against it. My {{father is}} blinded by some {{malignant}} vision which I must remove. And then, like David, I would try music to win the evil spirit from him; and once while singing I lifted my eyes towards him and saw his fixed on me and filled with tears; all his muscles seemed relaxed to softness. I sprung towards him with a cry of joy and would have thrown myself into his arms, but <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> roughly from him and left me. And even from this slight incident he contracted fresh gloom and an additional severity of manner.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus speaking," [...] says Angel, [...] "Father Hegesippus tore {{away his}} robe, which I was holding in my supplicating hands. In {{a sort of}} wildness I still grasped it tighter; <b>he</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> {{fiercely}} from him, and I fell with my face towards the ground. He quitted me, closing violently after him {{the door of the}} sacristy, in which this scene had passed. I was left alone in the darkness. Either from the violence of my fall, or the excess of my grief, a vein had burst in my throat, and a haemorrhage ensued. I had not the force to rise; I felt my senses rapidly sinking, and, presently, I lay stretched on the pavement, unconscious, and bathed in my blood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{mother took}} a little village shop, and I went to the village school. At first, I think I did not work very hard; but {{fortunately}} there was a change in masters, and the new one turned {{out one of the}} best friends a boy ever had. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> <b>me</b> on greatly and, when I was apprenticed to a mill wright, he urged me to continue my education by working of an evening. I stuck to it hard, and with his help learned, therefore, a good deal more than was usual, in my station of life. My mother was always particular about my speaking and, what with that and the books, I suppose I talk better than they generally do." ...|$|E
5000|$|Jānis Porziņģis competed at the European 2nd tier EuroCup level, {{the same}} level in Europe that Kristaps later played at, in one game, and played European {{professional}} club basketball in various national leagues, including the Italian League, for more than 10 years. He is known to mentor his younger brother {{on and off the}} court and often called him after playing games for Cajasol Sevilla in Spain. Kristaps talked about the relationship in an interview, [...] "We'd break down the details. We watched the film together. <b>He's</b> always <b>pushing</b> <b>me</b> to work hard. We just {{spend a lot of time}} together and we just talk about basketball all the time..." [...] The elder Porziņģis helped him train in the summer and work out in the gym in preparation for international competition in 2012.|$|R
6000|$|... '"You {{should have}} said that first," [...] said Toby. <b>He</b> <b>pushed</b> plates at <b>me</b> and the Indian put bread and pork on them, {{and a glass of}} Madeira wine. I told him I was off the French ship, which I had joined on account of my mother being French. That was true enough when you think of it, and besides I saw that the French was all the fashion in Philadelphia. Toby and the Indian whispered and I went on picking up the pills.|$|R
