40|$|Problem statement: Reference agro-climatic Weather Stations (WS) {{are rarely}} found in newly {{reclaimed}} areas. The usage of weather data from non-reference WS {{may lead to}} inaccurate estimations of <b>Evapo</b> Transpiration (ET), especially if the non-reference stations are distant from the reclaimed location. Approach: Weather data from four WS located at Riyadh were used to calculate ET by using Penman Monteith (PM) and Hargreaves equations. PM equation was applied with both alfalfa and grass reference crops. Calculations were done with and without temperature correction for non-reference weather stations. All calculations were compared with measured lysimeter data and corrections in Hargreaves formula were suggested. Results: (1) : Weather data from non-reference WS can be used safely to calculate ET only when temperature corrections are applied. (2) Hargreaves formula underestimates ET at all locations in the study area. By applying the simple linear correction to the data, highly acceptable results are obtainned. (3) The ET ratio between alfalfa and grass in Riyadh is 1. 25. Conclusion: The study concluded that temperature correction for non-reference WS is essential to ensure acceptable ET calculations.

Information on different heat flow channels was {{extracted from the}} measured dynamics of detector signals due to X-ray events. At the optimum operation point, the extracted effective electron temperature decreased from 88 mK down to 43 mK due to self-cooling, roughly doubling the detector sensitivity. Key words: Microcalorimeter, Cryogenic detector, Tunnel junction, Microfabrication, Self-cooling Energy resolving single photon detectors are of great interest for astrophysics, material science, medical applications or any other field, where high quantum efficiency paired with direct energy information are desirable. Normal metal–insulator– superconductor (NIS) junction based cryogenicmicrocalorimetersare very attractive and proven candidates for such high resolution detectors [1]. Essential requirements for NIS spectrometers are low barrier leakage currents and operation at low temperatures for a small heat capacity of the absorber. The latter can be met or improved by the Peltierlike effect of hot electron tunneling [2, 3, 4]. The efficiency of power transfer out of the absorber is increased by coupling the normal metal symmetrically via two tunnel junctions in series [5] (SINIS structure).

40|$|Abstract: Restoration {{activities}} in the Central Valley of California and elsewhere require accurate evapotranspiration information, which can then {{be used for a}} wide variety of surface and subsurface hydrologic evaluations. However, directly measuring evapotranspiration can be difficult or impossible depending on the evaluation’s time frame. Transferability of measured evapotranspiration in time and space is also necessary but typically requires a weather-based reference. For nonagricultural vegetation, there is at present time no standard reference, which makes the evaluation of a variety of vegetation types from different sources difficult and time-consuming. This paper examines several methods used to estimate evapotranspiration from native vegetation, including the use of vegetation coefficients (Kv). Vegetation coefficients are based on a standardized reference and are computed as the ratio of vegetation evapotranspiration (ETv) to the grass reference <b>evapo</b> transpiration (ETo). These monthly Kv values are used to compute the long-term (for this study, 1922 – 2009) average ETv for vegetation types documented to exist in California’s Central Valley prior to the arrival of the first European settlers in the mid- 18 th century. For vegetation that relies on precipitation and soil moisture storage, a calibrated daily soil–water balance with a dual crop coefficient approach was used to compute evapotranspiration regionally over the time frame.

40|$|The physically-based soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer model PROMET (PRocess-Oriented Model for <b>Evapo</b> Transpiration) {{developed}} at the Institute of Geography, University of Munich, {{is applied to the}} Ammer basin (approx. 600 km 2) in the alpine foreland of Germany. The hourly actual evapotranspiration rate is calculated for a 14 -year time series. A rainfall-runoff model, based on an enhanced distributed TOPMODEL structure, is linked to the SVAT-model in order to provide a hydrological model covering the water-cycle at the basin scale in a 30 m-resolution. The model is driven with meteorological data taken from regular synoptic stations of the German Weather Service. Soil physical and plant physiological parameters for the SVAT model were either measured at the test site or taken from literature. The topographical parameters were derived from detailed digital terrain analysis. The study intends to combine, within a GIS-based model framework, the understanding and application of physical processes inherent in the basin such as the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of evapotranspiration and runoff patterns. The influence of an evapotranspiration coefficient ET coeff, implemented in the formulation of the soil-topographic-index, to account for seasonal dynamics in distributed runoff formation due to the annual course of vegetation activity is investigated. The SVAT model shows convincing results in the long-term water balance description with a mean annual deviation of less then 6 % over a fourteen year time period. Introducing the evapotranspiration-soil-topographic-index α ET leads to a considerable improvement; the runoff model component simulating the daily runoff over the year reaches an efficiency of ε = 0. 92.

40|$|In 1988, a new act of Parliament {{introduced}} a national curriculum and national assessment to Great Britain. This article traces {{the background of}} practice and ideology {{that led to this}} innovation and then describes the development of the policy for national assessment. An initial and professionally acceptable formulation has been slowly transformed to the point where teachers have refused to carry out prescribed national testing. The reasons for this breakdown are analyzed. The political and technical lessons that can be drawn from this analysis will be of relevance to many other countries. In 1988, a new piece of legislation, the Edu-cation Reform Act, brought about radical and comprehensive changes in education in Britain. This article focuses on the history and effects of that change as it related to assessment and testing in schools. The aspects of the act that gave the na-tional government the power to specify a national curriculum were broadly welcomed, but there were many arguments over detail and some noteworthy opposition (Blishen, 1988). The proposal that raised alarm was the plan to have a national assessment that would test every pupil at ages 7, 11, 14, and 16 (Torrance, 1988). I was asked to lead a working group to advise the education minis-ter on the way in which this general intention should be put into effect. When the plans of my group were pub-lished (Department of Education and Sci-ence [DES], 1988 a, 1988 b), they were widely welcomed by the teaching profession, al-though, as explained below, some unease was expressed.

40|$|Evapotranspiration {{has been}} {{recognized}} as one of the most uncertain term in the surface water balance simulated by land surface models. In this study, the SURFEX/ISBAA- gs simulations of evapotranspiration are assessed at local scale over a 12 year 5 Mediterranean crop succession. The model is evaluated in its standard implementation which relies on the use of the ISBA pedotransfer estimates of the soil properties. The originality of this work consists in explicitly representing the succession of crop cycles and inter-crop bare soil periods in the simulations and assessing its impact on the dynamic of simulated and measured evapotranspiration over a long period of time. 10 The analysis focuses on key soil parameters which drive the simulation of evapotranspiration, namely the rooting depth, the soil moisture at saturation, the soil moisture at field capacity and the soil moisture at wilting point. The simulations achieved with the standard values of these parameters are compared to those achieved with the in situ values. The portability of the ISBA pedotransfer functions is evaluated over a typical 15 Mediterranean crop site. Various in situ estimates of the soil parameters are considered and distinct parametrization strategies are tested to represent the evapotranspiration dynamic over the crop succession. This work shows that evapotranspiration mainly results from the soil evaporation when it is continuously simulated over a Mediterranean crop succession. The <b>evapo</b> 20 transpiration simulated with the standard surface and soil parameters of the model is largely underestimated. The deficit in cumulative evapotranspiration amounts to 24 % over 12 years. The bias in daily daytime evapotranspiration is − 0. 24 mmday− 1. The ISBA pedotransfer estimates of the soil moisture at saturation and at wilting point are overestimated which explains most of the evapotranspiration underestimation. The 25 overestimation of the soil moisture at wilting point causes the underestimation of transpiration at the end of the crop cycles. The overestimation of the soil moisture at saturation triggers the underestimation of the soil evaporation during the wet soil periods. The use of field capacity values derived from laboratory retention measurements leads to inaccurate simulation of soil evaporation due to the lack of representativeness of the soil structure variability at the field scale. The most accurate simulation is achieved with the values of the soil hydraulic properties derived from field measured soil moisture. Their temporal analysis over each crop cycle provides meaningful estimates of the 5 wilting point, the field capacity and the rooting depth to represent the crop water needs and accurately simulate the evapotranspiration over the crop succession. We showed that the uncertainties in the eddy-covariance measurements are significant and can explain a large part of the unresolved random differences between the simulations and the measurements of evapotranspiration. Other possible model shortcomings include 10 the lack of representation of soil vertical heterogeneity and root profile along with inaccurate energy balance partitioning between the soil and the vegetation at low LAI...|$|E
40|$|Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) {{plantations}} cover {{large and}} continuously increasing areas of humid tropical lowlands. Landscapes dominated by oil palms usually {{consist of a}} mosaic of mono-cultural, homogeneous stands of varying age, which may be heterogeneous in their water use characteristics. However, studies on the water use characteristics of oil palms are still {{at an early stage}} and {{there is a lack of}} knowledge on how oil palm expansion will affect the major components of the hydrological cycle. To provide first insights into hydrological landscape-level consequences of oil palm cultivation, we derived transpiration rates of oil palms in stands of varying age, estimated the contribution of palm transpiration to evapotranspiration, and analyzed the influence of fluctuations in environmental variables on oil palm water use. We studied 15 two- to 25 -year old stands in the lowlands of Jambi, Indonesia. A sap flux technique with an oil palm specific calibration and sampling scheme was used to derive leaf-, palm- and stand-level water use rates in all stands under comparable environmental conditions. Additionally, in a two- and a 12 -year old stand, eddy covariance measurements were conducted to derive evapotranspiration rates. Water use rates per leaf and palm increased 5 -fold from an age of 2 years to a stand age of approx. 10 years and then remained relatively constant. A similar trend was visible, but less pronounced, for estimated stand transpiration rates of oil palms; they varied 12 -fold, from 0. 2 mm day − 1 in a 2 -year old to 2. 5 mm day − 1 in a 12 -year old stand, showing particularly high variability in transpiration rates among medium-aged stands. Comparing sap flux and eddy-covariance derived water fluxes suggests that transpiration contributed 8 % to evapotranspiration in the 2 -year old stand and 53 % in the 12 -year old stand, indicating variable and substantial additional sources of evaporation, e. g., from the soil, the ground vegetation and from trunk epiphytes. Diurnally, oil palm transpiration rates were characterized by an early peak between 10 and 11 a. m.; there was a pronounced hysteresis in the leaf water use response to changes in vapor pressure deficit for all palms of advanced age. On the day-to-day basis this resulted in a relatively low variability of oil palm water use regardless of fluctuations in vapor pressure deficit and radiation. We conclude that oil palm dominated landscapes show some spatial variations in (<b>evapo)</b> transpiration rates, e. g., due to varying age-structures, but that the temporal variability of oil palm transpiration is rather low. The stand transpiration of some of the studied oil palm stands was as high or even higher than values reported for different tropical forests, indicating a high water use of oil palms under yet to be explained site or management conditions. Our study provides first insights into the eco-hydrological characteristics of oil palms as well as a first estimate of oil palm water use across a gradient of plantation age. It sheds first light on some of the hydrological consequences of the continuing expansion of oil palm plantations...|$|E
