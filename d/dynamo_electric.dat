50|$|From the mid-1880s, Yablochkov mostly {{occupied}} {{himself with}} problems of generating electric energy.

50|$|The {{possibility}} of obtaining the electric current in large quantities, and economically, {{by means of}} <b>dynamo</b> <b>electric</b> machines gave impetus {{to the development of}} incandescent and arc lighting. Until these machines had attained a commercial basis voltaic batteries were the only available source of current for electric lighting and power. The cost of these batteries, however, and the difficulties of maintaining them in reliable operation were prohibitory of their use for practical lighting purposes. The date of the employment of arc and incandescent lamps may be set at about 1877.|$|E

40|$|Recently Shukurov et al [Phys Rev E (2008) ] {{presented}} a numerical solution of a Moebius strip dynamo flow, to investigate {{its use in}} modelling dynamo flows in Perm torus of liquid sodium dynamo experiments. Here, by analogy one presents an <b>electric</b> <b>dynamo</b> on a twisted torus or Klein bottle topology. An exact solution {{in the form of}} flat Klein bottle dynamo flow is obtained. It is shown that {{even in the absence of}} magnetic <b>dynamos</b> initial <b>electric</b> fields can be amplified in distinct points of the Klein bottle. In this case diffusion is taken as η≈ 5. 0 × 10 ^- 3 Ω-m the electric potential is obtained. The difference of electric fields at the beginning of plasma flow profile is ΔE_Dyn≈ 468 V/m, which is stronger than the <b>electric</b> <b>dynamo</b> field obtained in the magnetic axis of spheromaks, which is of the order of E_Dyn≈ 200 V/m. The potential of the dynamo at the surface of the Earth computed by Boozer [Phys Fluids B (1993) ] of Φ≈ 160 V, is used to obtain the magnetic vector constant A_ 0 ≈ 10 ^ 6 V. In general the associated magnetic dynamo is shown to be a fast dynamo in force-free plasmas in Klein bottle. Of course if the magnetic dynamo growth is turned on the <b>electric</b> <b>dynamo</b> shall be able to sustain itself along the Klein bottle.

5000|$|Direct current was {{produced}} in 1800 in Italian Physicist Alessandro Volta's battery, his Voltaic pile. The nature of how the current flowed was not well understood until French physicist André-Marie Ampère discovered the current traveled in one direction from positive to negative. When French instrument maker Hippolyte Pixii built the first <b>dynamo</b> <b>electric</b> generator in 1832, he found that as the magnet used passed the loops of wire each half turn, it caused the flow of electricity to reverse, generating an alternating current. At Ampère's suggestion, Pixii later added a commutator, a type of [...] "switch" [...] where contacts on the shaft work with [...] "brush" [...] contacts to produce direct current.|$|E
50|$|He also {{discovered}} that induced currents are established in a second closed circuit when the current strength is varied in the first wire, and that {{the direction of the}} current in the secondary circuit is opposite to that in the first circuit. Also that a current is induced in a secondary circuit when another circuit carrying a current is moved to and from the first circuit, and that the approach or withdrawal of a magnet to or from a closed circuit induces momentary currents in the latter. In short, within the space of a few months Faraday discovered by experiment virtually all the laws and facts now known concerning electro-magnetic induction and magneto-electric induction. Upon these discoveries, with scarcely an exception, depends the operation of the telephone, the dynamo machine, and incidental to the <b>dynamo</b> <b>electric</b> machine practically all the gigantic electrical industries of the world, including electric lighting, electric traction, the operation of electric motors for power purposes, and electro-plating, electrotyping, etc.|$|E
5000|$|A notable {{advance in}} the art of dynamo {{construction}} was made by Mr. S. A. Varley in 1866 and by Dr. Charles William Siemens and Mr. Charles Wheatstone, who independently discovered that when a coil of wire, or armature, of the dynamo machine is rotated between the poles (or in the [...] "field") of an electromagnet, a weak current is set up in the coil due to residual magnetism in the iron of the electromagnet, and that if the circuit of the armature be connected with the circuit of the electromagnet, the weak current developed in the armature increases the magnetism in the field. This further increases the magnetic lines of force in which the armature rotates, which still further increases the current in the electromagnet, thereby producing a corresponding increase in the field magnetism, and so on, until the maximum electromotive force which the machine is capable of developing is reached. By means of this principle the dynamo machine develops its own magnetic field, thereby much increasing its efficiency and economical operation. Not by any means, however, was the <b>dynamo</b> <b>electric</b> machine perfected at the time mentioned.|$|E
