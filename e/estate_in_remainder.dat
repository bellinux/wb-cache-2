40|$|Although {{less common}} {{than a half}} century ago, 1 {{it is not at}} all unusual to see use made of legal life estates and {{remainder}}s, not to mention life <b>estates</b> and <b>remainders</b> <b>in</b> trust.

50|$|The fee tail {{has been}} {{abolished}} {{in all but}} four states in the United States: Massachusetts, Maine, Delaware and Rhode Island. However, {{in the first three}} states, property can be sold or deeded as any other property would be, with the fee tail only applying in case of death without a will. In Rhode Island, a fee tail is treated as a life <b>estate</b> with <b>remainder</b> <b>in</b> the life tenant's children. New York abolished fee tail in 1782, while many other states within the U.S. never recognized it at all. In most states in the United States, an attempt to create a fee tail results in a fee simple; even in those four states that still allow fee tail, the estate holder may convert his fee tail to a fee simple during his lifetime by executing a deed.|$|R
