5|$|Another {{large group}} of victims was {{composed}} of German and foreign civilian activists {{across the political spectrum}} who opposed the Nazi regime, captured resistance fighters (many of whom were executed during—or immediately after—their interrogation, particularly in occupied Poland and France) and, sometimes, their families. German political prisoners were a substantial proportion of the first inmates at Dachau (the prototypical Nazi concentration camp). The political People's Court was notorious for the number of <b>its</b> <b>death</b> sentences.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ending}} {{that was in}} the {{original}} theatrical version, Ellen rammed the shark with Mike's boat, mortally wounding it. The shark then causes the boat to break apart with <b>its</b> <b>death</b> contortions, forcing the people on the boat to jump off to avoid going down with it. American audiences disapproved of this ending. A new ending was ordered shot for foreign distribution with the shark getting stabbed with the bow sprit and then exploding; and with Jake being found wounded but alive. This version is what Universal used on home media releases.|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer's operas {{consistently}} enjoyed enormous popularity {{during his}} lifetime, and {{the verdict of}} (the then pro-Meyerbeer) Wagner in 1841, when the Paris Opéra was vainly awaiting Le prophète and L'Africaine, was not atypical:The Paris Opéra lies dying. It looks for its salvation to the German Messiah, Meyerbeer; if he keeps it waiting much longer, <b>its</b> <b>death</b> agonies will begin...It is for that reason...that one only sees Robert le Diable and Les Huguenots turning up again when the mediocrities are forced to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|The Mingo Oak (also {{known as}} the Mingo White Oak) was a white oak (Quercus alba) in the U.S. state of West Virginia. First {{recognized}} for its age and size in 1931, the Mingo Oak was the oldest and largest living white oak tree in the world until <b>its</b> <b>death</b> in 1938.|$|E
5|$|In Greek mythology, Serpens {{represents}} a snake {{held by the}} healer Asclepius. Represented in the sky by the constellation Ophiuchus, Asclepius once killed a snake, but the animal was subsequently resurrected after a second snake placed a revival herb on it before <b>its</b> <b>death.</b> As snakes shed their skin every year, they were known as the symbol of rebirth in ancient Greek society, and legend says Asclepius would revive dead humans using the same technique he witnessed. Although this is likely the logic for Serpens' presence with Ophiuchus, the true reason is still not fully known. Sometimes, Serpens was depicted as coiling around Ophiuchus, {{but the majority of}} atlases showed Serpens passing either behind Ophiuchus' body or between his legs.|$|E

5|$|In a subsequent, more {{detailed}} report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky {{concluded that the}} egg almost certainly belonged to Deinonychus, representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found {{in close contact with}} the gastralia suggesting that Deinonychus might have brooded its eggs. This implies that Deinonychus used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an endothermy similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued. Unlike other theropods in their study of specimens found associated with eggs or nests, it had finished growing at the time of <b>its</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sherwood {{lived in}} Pungo, Princess Anne County (today part of Virginia Beach), and married James Sherwood, a planter, in 1680. The couple had three sons: John, James, and Richard. Her first case was in 1697; she {{was accused of}} casting a spell on a bull, {{resulting}} in <b>its</b> <b>death,</b> but the matter was dismissed by the agreement of both parties. The following year she was accused of witchcraft by two neighbors; she supposedly bewitched the hogs and cotton crop of one of them. Sherwood sued for slander after each accusation, but her lawsuits were unsuccessful {{and her husband had}} to pay court costs. In 1706 she was convicted of witchcraft and was incarcerated. Freed from prison by 1714, she recovered her property from Princess Anne County (her husband had died in 1701). She did not remarry, and lived on her farm until her death in 1740 at the age of about 80.|$|E
5|$|Several large {{stones are}} set in the ground near gates or at points outside the walls of Ambohimanga. Rulers would stand atop these stones, each {{identified}} by distinct names, to deliver speeches to the public. To the south were the stones called Ambatomasina and Ambatomenaloha, while Ambatorangotina was situated to the northwest. The latter stone was of particular importance: here the twelve leaders of the Ambatofotsy clan first declared their rejection of Andrianjafy's rule and their allegiance to his nephew, Andrianampoinimerina. Upon taking the throne, Andrianampoinimerina used this site to first declare new laws and decrees that would later be announced throughout the kingdom. This was also the main site at Ambohimanga for dispensing justice. After Andrianampoinimerina's succession to the throne, he sacrificed a black zebu whose mother had died, named Lemainty ("black one"), with repeated spear thrusts; after <b>its</b> <b>death,</b> the animal was cut into pieces and buried on the site. Lemainty was thereafter regularly invoked in royal speeches and decrees to allude {{to the fate of}} those who misguidedly sought to forsake the protection of their guardian, the sovereign, and his laws.|$|E
