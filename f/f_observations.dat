The observations are in good agreement with numerical results from a Rice Covection Model run that involved {{a sharp increase in}} the polar cap potential drop followed by a subsequent decrease. The zonal disturbance electric field pattern is latitude independent, and the corresponding amplitudes change approximately as L exp n (where n is about 1. 5). The meridional electric field patterns and amplitudes have larger latitudinal variations. The mid-, low, and equatorial electric fields from the Rice Convection Model are in good agreement with previous results from the semianalytic, Senior-Blanc (1987) model. Also discussed are three physical mechanisms (over-shielding, fossil winds, and magnetic reconfiguration) that contribute to the long lasting (1 - 2 h) equatorial zonal electric field perturbations associated with a sudden northward turning of the IMF. It is predicted that the penetration of high latitude electric fields to low latitudes should, in general, be closely related to the rate of motion of the shielding layer and the equatorward edge of the diffuse aurora...|$|E

The Cornell 50 MHz portable radar interferometer (CUPRI) operated concurrently with the Altair UHF incoherent scatter radar throughout July and August and supported two sounding rocket flights on July 30 and August 2. This experiment provided the first opportunity to simultaneously diagnose equatorial spread F using the three prime experimental techniques: VHF/UHF coherent scatter, incoherent scatter, and in situ probe measurements of electric field and density fluctuations. The intensity of the coherent echoes observed was consistent with typical Jicamarca spread <b>F</b> <b>observations,</b> but chains of periodic, large-scale plasma upwellings were observed more often and for much longer durations on Kwajalein than have been seen over Peru. CUPRI also measured Doppler frequencies in one upwelling corresponding to 1200 -m/s plasma drift velocities. This measurement agrees with recent observations of supersonic drift rates at the magnetic equator by spacecraft. Near the most active localized plasma upwellings, interferometer data reveal that the zonal drift rate of plasma irregularities can vary sharply in space, {{as one would expect}} for two-dimensional incompressible flow. We introduce a semiempirical model of the three-dimensional spectrum of F region irregularities that is consistent with the one-dimensional spectra of density fluctuations observed by sounding rockets and with the axial ratio of irregularities determined recently.

Putting these low-latitude measurements in context with the global dynamics of the storm, we will present results from simulations and observations in our efforts to better understand the effects of this storm on the different regions of the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere.

40|$|Community-based {{education}} {{is about a}} decade old in basic nursing education in South Africa, An extensive review of literature revealed that although CBE was a familiar concept in South Africa, there was however, limited understanding of what this phenomenon means. The {{purpose of the study}} was to analyse the concept ‘community-based education’ with the aim of discovering shared understanding of this phenomenon in basic nursing education within the South African context. Strauss and Corbin’s (1990) grounded theory approach was used to guide the research process. The South African Nursing Council’s (SANC) education committee, the National Department of Health, human resources division representatives as well as seven nursing education institutions with well-established CBE programmes participated in the study. The data was collected by means o <b>f</b> <b>observations,</b> interviews and document analysis. Purposive sampling and later theoretical sampling was used for selecting interviewees. This resulted in a total o f 45 interviewees. The data collection and initial data analysis took place concurrently. Descriptive analysis followed by conceptual analysis was performed using Strauss and Corbin’s model. The findings in this study revealed that community-based {{education is}} education that uses the community extensively, especially the under-developed and under-resourced settings, for learning purposes in order to enhance relevance of nursing education to the needs of the South African population. The core discriminatory characteristics o f CBE were found to include; primacy of the community as a learning environment; the early exposure of students to community-based learning experiences; community-based learning experiences dominating the curriculum, exposure to community-based learning experiences throughout the curriculum, vertical sequencing of community-based learning experiences in a curriculum, starting from primary settings to secondary and later tertiary health care settings to facilitate the development of competencies required when serving in all these settings, and lastly, learning through providing service to the underresourced communities. Community involvement and partnership, problem-centred learning, valid assessment of learning emanated as important characteristics of CBE but which were identified as gaps in the existing programmes. Recommendations focused on these gaps as well as to the problem of community-based learning experiences which were mainly concentrated in first and/or second year levels in most o f the programmes...|$|E

Based on these metrics, we propose a standardised template for reporting tree invasions that we hope will facilitate cross-species and inter-regional comparison. While we feel this represents a valuable step towards standardised reporting, there is an urgent need to develop more consistent metrics for impact and threat, and for many specific purposes additional metrics are still needed (e. g. detectability is required to assess the feasibility of eradication).

Thus, a mechanical concept, where different microstructural characteristics are incorporated, appears to be necessary, based on the division of wood into meaningful scales o <b>f</b> <b>observation.</b> At each scale, effective strength properties are to be determined and a multiscale approach needs to be applied, for which conventional numerical methods appear to be inefficient.

Limit analysis belongs to the group of direct plastic analysis methods, focusing exclusively on the time instant of structural collapse, and delivering the ultimate strength. Compared with conventional numerical approaches that have previously been applied to wood, limit analysis approaches are much more stable and efficient. In this work, orthotropic failure criteria and periodic boundary conditions are implemented into both lower bound and upper bound numerical limit analysis formulations.

40|$|The {{accurate}} modelling {{of fundamental}} frequency, or F 0, in HMM-based speech synthesis {{is a critical}} factor in achieving high quality speech. However, it is also difficult because F 0 values are normally considered to depend on a binary voicing decision such that they are continuous in voiced regions and undefined in unvoiced regions. A widely used solution is to use a multi-space probability distribution HMM (MSDHMM), which directly models discontinuous <b>F</b> 0 <b>observations.</b> An alternative solution, continuous F 0 modelling, has been recently proposed and shown to be more effective in achieving natural synthesised speech. Here, continuous <b>F</b> 0 <b>observations</b> are assumed to always exist and hence they can be modelled by standard HMMs. This paper describes a general mathematical framework for discontinuous F 0 modelling, of which MSDHMM is a special case, and compares it to continuous F 0 modelling. Various aspects associated with continuous F 0 modelling, the use of a single F 0 stream, globally tied distributions (GTD) and the assumption of a continuous unvoiced F 0, are discussed in theory and examined in experiments. Both objective measures and subjective listening tests demonstrate that the introduction of continuous unvoiced F 0 is vital for achieving speech quality improvement.
