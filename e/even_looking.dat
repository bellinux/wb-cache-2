25|$|Following a long {{international}} break, Lyon faced Lorient at home, {{their first}} and only back-to-back home league match set. In the match, which was fairly <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> at the statistics, Lyon controlled possession for 57 percent of the match, but did not score a goal until the 72nd following a perfect cross from Sidney Govou into the box, which landed {{at the head of}} Michel Bastos and then {{into the back of the}} net. Lyon maintained the 1–0 lead to win the match moving the club into a tie for second place with title rivals Bordeaux. The following week, Lyon faced rivals Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes in a match that saw a Lyon side missing several key players. In the 29th minute, the Parisians got a well-deserved goal from former Lyon player Ludovic Giuly. Despite the home side maintaining their attack well into the second half, their first half goal was canceled out following an Aly Cissokho cross into the box that saw Bafétimbi Gomis get a slight touch on the ball to get it past Grégory Coupet. The goal secured a point for Lyon and also allowed the club to maintain their top 2 position in the table. Lyon contested up-and-comers Toulouse the following match day. Lyon defense was again the first to concede allowing a goal from youngster Moussa Sissoko in just the eighth minute. Despite conceding early, however, Lyon's attack was extremely uptempo, which allowed the away side to break into numerous counterattacks. Lyon's attack finally paid off, in the 52nd minute following a goal from Yannis Tafer, which was his first professional goal. Tafer, who came on as a half-time substitute, secured the goal following a cross into the box by the dangerous Cissokho. The French youth international ran near post and got a shot off high into the visiting net. With Lyon's confidence high, their attack increased, which led to numerous chances. Eventually, Lyon got a goal from Gomis, his second in two matches to give the club a 2–1 victory. The following week, Lyon reached top of the table for the first time this season, courtesy of a 2–0 win over Lens. Despite enduring a hostile crowd and constant pressure from Lens, Lyon and their defense stood tall with Govou and Kim Källström getting both goals in the seventh and 78th minute, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire were {{developed}} by Game Freak and Nintendo {{under the direction of}} Junichi Masuda. As with its predecessors, Ken Sugimori was the art director, although these were the first games in which he did not single-handedly produce all of the art. When asked where his design team came up with the ideas for all of the new Pokémon, Sugimori stated that they got their ideas from past experiences in their childhood involving nature, animals, and the media and then base them on insects. <b>Even</b> <b>looking</b> at the world in a different perspective sometimes provided inspiration for the creatures. [...] "First we select an insect and after that we add essential elements to the insects to make it more like Pokemon, such as adding some hard shape to it, to be more like steel," [...] Sugimori said, describing the process of creating a Pokémon.|$|E
500|$|Sexual Preference {{attracted}} considerable {{media attention}} in 1981. Prior to its publication, Jane E. Brody wrote in The New York Times {{that the study}} was [...] "likely to arouse controversy {{not only because of}} its findings, which the authors expect to anger both the psychoanalytic and the homosexual communities, but also because it relies on the memories of those interviewed and on a statistical technique called path analysis that is subject to misuse and can only explore existing notions, not create new ones." [...] According to Brody, Bell said that he expected the study to be condemned by both [...] "radical gays for <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> into the subject and by the analysts who may say we're trying to paint a glowing picture of homosexuality," [...] the psychologist John DeCecco called Sexual Preference [...] "very dubious on a theoretical basis and on the basis of how reliable and valid is asking people about their childhood", and the psychoanalyst Irving Bieber described Bell et al.′s findings as [...] "totally disparate" [...] with his experience from psychiatric consultation.|$|E

500|$|Accompanied by her adviser, Neto, Manasa {{descended to}} earth to see human devotees. She was {{initially}} mocked {{by the people}} but then Manasa forced them to worship her by raining calamity on those who denied her power. She managed to convert people from different walks of life, including the Muslim ruler Hasan, but failed to convert Chand Sadagar [...] Manasa {{wanted to become a}} goddess like Lakshmi or Saraswati. To get there she had to achieve the worship of Chand Sadagar who was extremely adamant and took oath not to worship Manasa. Thus to gain his fear and insecurity, Manasa one by one killed his six sons [...] At last Manasa conspired against two dancers of Indras Court who loved each other, Anirudha and Usha [...] Anirudh had to take birth as Lakhinder, Chand and Sanaka's seventh son. Usha took birth as behula and married him. Manasa killed him but Behula floated on water for nine months with the dead body of her husband and finally brought back the lives of the seven sons and the lost prosperity of Chand. At last, he yielded by offering a flower to the goddess with his left hand without <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> at her. This gesture made Manasa so happy that she resurrected all of Chand's sons and restored his fame and fortunes. The Mangal kavyas say that after this, the worship of Manasa was popular forever.|$|E
500|$|The final story, [...] "Lost in Space", {{introduces}} Johnny (Joe Strummer). Upset {{after losing}} his job and his girlfriend (Dee Dee), Johnny [...] – known, much to his chagrin, as Elvis – drunkenly brandishes a gun in a bar before leaving with his friend Will Robinson (Rick Aviles) and his ex-girlfriend's brother Charlie (Steve Buscemi), who believes Johnny to be his brother-in-law. They stop at a liquor store, which Johnny robs using the gun and severely wounds the owner in the process. Fearing {{the consequences of the}} incident, Johnny, Will and Charlie retire to the hotel to hide out for the night; there, Johnny gets drunker. Charlie realizes that Will shares the same name as the character Will Robinson from the television show Lost in Space, which Johnny has never heard of. Charlie and Johnny proceed to tell him about the show, and Will comments that that is how he feels then with Charlie and Johnny: lost in space. The next morning, Charlie discovers that Johnny isn't really his brother-in-law, which angers him because of what they've been through. Johnny attempts to shoot himself, and while struggling to prevent him, Charlie is shot in the leg. Leaving the hotel, the three rush to escape a police car that isn't <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> for them. The closing credits show the train, the airport and the final views of the characters from the first two stories.|$|E
500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are doing your own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> at women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E

2500|$|Lowry {{was born}} on 1 November 1887 at 8 Barrett Street, Stretford, which was then in Lancashire. It was a {{difficult}} birth, and his mother Elizabeth, who hoped for a girl, was uncomfortable <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> at him at first. Later she expressed envy of her sister Mary, who had [...] "three splendid daughters" [...] instead of one [...] "clumsy boy". Lowry's father Robert, who was of northern Irish descent, worked as a clerk for the Jacob Earnshaw and Son Property Company and was a withdrawn and introverted man. Lowry once described him as [...] "a cold fish" [...] and [...] "(the sort of man who) realised he had a life to live and {{did his best to}} get through it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott Ellison of Saving Content panned the PlayStation 3 {{version of}} the game. He stated [...] "simply put, do not buy this game." [...] Steve Melton of XBLA Fans agreed. He felt that with a title update the game could improve, but that it felt [...] "like it was a {{contract}} job." [...] The vehicle physics and handling were particular points of negative commentary. Ellison said that [...] "the cars {{feel as if they}} don’t have any weight to them." [...] Melton concurred and added that the handling was overly sensitive. [...] "Sneeze and the car’ll be in the wall", he stated. Melton did concede that the steering could be adjusted in the game's options, but that the default configuration would dissuade most players from <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> there. In the May 2011 issue of Official Xbox Magazine the game also received extremely poor reception. The reviewer stated [...] "Do yourself a favor: stay as far away from this wreck as possible." [...] Levi Buchanan of IGN scored the iOS {{version of the}} game much higher than the average on other platforms. He stated that [...] "Days of Thunder succeeds as both a silly and serious game." [...] He further noted that the game's many cars and tracks gave it lasting appeal on the iPhone.|$|E

2500|$|Mireille {{was invited}} to Paris by the {{impresario}} Régis Durcourt to sing on the [...] "Song Parade" [...] television program, on 19 November 1965. Stark promised to write to her, but after months of waiting she gave up on him, and accepted Durcourt's offer. The truth has never been revealed how, but Mireille was suddenly moved-up to compete live on the Sunday 21 November 1965 episode of [...] "Jeu de la Chance," [...] a talent segment of the popular French program [...] "Télé-Dimanche." [...] Stark's ex-wife Nanou Taddéi worked at Studio 102, and probably recognized Mireille, as she participated in her earlier pre-audition. Mathieu explained that [...] "Song Parade" [...] offered only one chance to sing, while [...] "Jeu de la Chance" [...] offered many chances to sing, but only if she won, and she intended to win. Both the studio audience and telephone voters gave her a slight lead over five-time winner , so the producers called it a tie. Johnny Stark officially became her manager that night, and with his longtime assistant Nadine Joubert, helped prepare Mireille to win the contest the following week and bury Georgette. Stark and Lemaire had a mutual dislike for each other. In a short film called La guerre des Piaf (War of the Sparrows) Georgette and Mireille are interviewed separately, both are small and the same height. Mireille is surrounded by her sisters Monique and Christiane, with Johnny hovering in the background as she is interviewed {{for the first time}} on camera. She appears to be uncomfortable, staring at the floor during many of the questions, <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> dumbfounded once, like a deer in the headlights. Johnny finally comes to her rescue. In a later interview, she underscored the importance of the event, stating, [...] "For me, Paris was the end of the world. I never took a train or saw a camera before. I did not know what the outcome of the adventure would be." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{determine}} the team match-ups {{in the tournament}} a representative of each team entered a Battle royal where the order of elimination determined when the team would wrestle {{in the first round}} [...] the first two wrestlers eliminated would face off, then the next two and the next two, with the final two men in the ring facing off in the last of the opening round matches. The first Battle Royal, included Euforia, Kraneo, La Mascara, Máscara Dorada, Maximo, Mr. Águila, Mr. Niebla and Valiente. The match ended with La Mascara and Valiente as the last two wrestlers in the ring, which meant their teams would meet in the final first round match that evening. In the first round 2010 and 2011 winner Máscara Dorada formed a very well functioning, high flying team with Volador, Jr. to defeat the team of Guerrero Maya, Jr. and Euforia. The Parejas increibles concept was really highlighted in the second tournament match as Maximo, who plays an Exotico character, a character who is displays openly homosexual tendencies. During the match Maximo tried to kiss his opponents to distract them, but when denied he kissed his partner Mephisto instead. This enraged Mephisto who attacked his own partner and knocked him out, leaving him easy prey for La Sombra and Mr. Águila {{to move on to the}} next round. The other half of the 2010 and 2011 tournament winner, Atlantis put his differences with Mr. Niebla aside to allow the team to defeat Brazo de Plata and Kraneo, putting them in the second round. The final first round match saw Averno team up with the man that had forced him to unmask in 2011 at CMLL's Juicio Final ("Final Justice") show. The two got along just long enough to defeat Valiente and Olímpico, then Averno quickly left the ring, not <b>even</b> <b>looking</b> in La Mascara's direction. During the first of two second round matches Volador, Jr. landed wrong during a leaping move and had to actually be taken from the arena on a stretcher while the match was still going on. It is unclear if Volador, Jr.'s injury forced a change to the original plans or if La Sombra and Mr. Águila had been booked to win the match from the beginning. CMLL may have wanted the 2010 and 2011 winners to face off in the semifinal but due to Volador, Jr.'s injury that matchup never happened. In the other first round match. The final second round match saw Atlantis continue his Parejas Increibles tournament success as Atlantis and Mr. Niebla defeated Averno and La Mascara, aided by problems between Averno and La Mascara that started when La Mascara accidentally hit Averno and then Averno retaliated to leave his partner open for an easy loss. The third round saw more success for Atlantis and Mr. Niebla as they earned a spot in the finals when they disposed of La Sombra and Mr. Águila in their one fall match.|$|E
