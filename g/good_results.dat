40|$|ABSTRACT: One {{hundred and}} twenty-seven hips in 125 adults were treated for {{traumatic}} posterior dislo-cation {{during a period}} of two decades. Ninety-eight pa-tients (100 hips) were available for follow-up exami-nation at a minimum of five years (average, fourteen years) after injury. By both clinical and radiographic criteria eighty hips (80 per cent) had an excellent or <b>good</b> <b>result.</b> Forty-two per cent of the hips that were reduced more than six hours after the dislocation had an excellent or <b>good</b> <b>result</b> and 88 per cent of those that were reduced within six hours after dislocation had an excellent or <b>good</b> <b>result.</b> Thirty-one per cent of the hips with a Grade-III dislocation had an excellent or <b>good</b> <b>result,</b> as com-pared with 90 per cent of those with a Grade-I dislo-cation.

Since then, shunting is recommended predominantly, with occasional exceptions.|$|E

He signed Celtic's Colin Douglas for the challenge of Third Division football, but otherwise remained loyal to his promotion squad for the approaching 1981–82 season. Another strong September, six wins seeing the club rise to second in the table, won Bremner the Third Division Manager of the Month award. However a lean spell would follow, and from November to February Doncaster failed to win in the league.

Stein was criticised by the Scottish press after the team conceded two late goals and lost 2–1 at home to Poland, but they managed to beat Italy 1–0 at Hampden Park to raise some hope of qualification. Scotland suffered from several players withdrawing from the return match against Italy due to injury and a 3–0 defeat meant that they failed to qualify. Clyde manager John Prentice then took the job on a full-time basis in 1966, but left to manage Dundee after just six months and four games in charge.|$|E

5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat.

If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to <b>good</b> <b>results</b> if successful.

5|$|Pleurodesis is a {{procedure}} that permanently eliminates the pleural space and attaches the lung to the chest wall. No long-term study (20 years or more) has been performed on its consequences. <b>Good</b> <b>results</b> {{in the short term}} are achieved with a thoracotomy (surgical opening of the chest) with identification of any source of air leakage and stapling of blebs followed by pleurectomy (stripping of the pleural lining) of the outer pleural layer and pleural abrasion (scraping of the pleura) of the inner layer. During the healing process, the lung adheres to the chest wall, effectively obliterating the pleural space. Recurrence rates are approximately 1%. Post-thoracotomy pain is relatively common.|$|E
