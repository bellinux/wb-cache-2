Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.|$|E

[...] He noted the play does not compare with some of Durang's most absurd work, calling it [...] "blander and thinner". Brantley said there was comfort in an evening of deliverance of Chekhov's [...] "lost souls", by Durang.|$|E

[...] Harley Brown of Consequence of Sound website was impressed with the diversity of remixes on the album, prompting him to comment that [...] "just in time for the holiday season, there’s something for everyone on Born This Way: The Remix.

[...] The reviewer called the setting, situations, and characters [...] "bland", further describing the characters as [...] "cardboard nobodies", and did not review the rest of the series. The consensus among critics was that the voice acting was exceptional, with particular praise directed at A.J. Locascio's impersonation of Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly.
