40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between hyperventilation and increase in blood lactate during high-intensity constant-load <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> heat and normal conditions. Seven male volunteers exercised for 10 min on a cycle ergometer at 80 %·VO 2 max in heat (40 ºC, 50 %relative humidity: HT) and normal conditions (20 ºC, 50 % relative humidity: CON). Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, ventilation, blood lactate and blood electrolytes (K, Na, Cl−) were measured in HT and CON. We found that ventilation was significantly higher during <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> HT compared with CON (p< 0. 05) and RER tends to be higher in HT than in CON. Blood lactate was significantly higher at 3 min during <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> HT compared with CON (5. 96 ± 0. 57 mEq·l- 1 5. 00 ± 0. 28 mEq·l- 1, p< 0. 05). Change in strong ion difference [∆SID = (∆K ∆Na) − (∆Cl− ∆La−) ], which affects ∆HCO 3 − in blood significantly, was lower at 5 min during <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> HT compared with in CON (p< 0. 05). These results suggest that hyperventilation during <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> heat would induce lower HCO 3 − in blood and consequently would result in an increase in blood lactate at an earlier time during high-intensity <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> heat. It was concluded that hyperventilation during short-term high-intensity <b>exercise</b> <b>in</b> heat is temporarily associated with an increase in blood lactate...|$|R
