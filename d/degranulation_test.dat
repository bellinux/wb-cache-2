40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{recently}} recognized that long-term infusions of hydroxyethyl starch (HES) {{as a substitute}} of human plasma may lead to deposits within the human skin and clinically induces severe pruritus in approximately one-third of the patients treated. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the clinical features and pathophysiology of HES-induced itching. METHODS: Clinical data of 86 patients were analyzed retrospectively. Furthermore, 10 patients were followed prospectively, in whom we also performed routine laboratory tests, skin biopsies, allergological investigations (skin prick, basophil <b>degranulation</b> <b>test),</b> and substance P measurements in stimulated macrophages. RESULTS: Special features of HES-induced pruritus included long latency of onset and persistence. Noteworthy, itching is not always generalized. 30 % of patients present with localized pruritus. Symptoms were not relieved by antihistaminics. Accordingly, the basophil <b>degranulation</b> <b>test</b> after HES exposure was negative. Also, substance P release from macrophages was not increased following HES stimulation. Deposits were found mainly in macrophages and endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that pruritus in HES-infused patients is most likely not triggered by pruritogenic mediators. We support data from the recent literature, suggesting a direct stimulation of cutaneous nerves by HES deposits. In patients suffering from long-standing itching it seems important to consider previous HES exposure as a possible cause not only in generalized pruritus but also in localized symptoms...|$|E
40|$|Aims: To study RBL- 2 H 3 cell degranulation {{phenomena}} {{induced by}} some TCMIs through cell morphological and ul-tra-structural observation, released enzyme activity and establish RBL- 2 H 3 cell <b>degranulation</b> <b>test</b> indicated by β-hexosaminidase activity {{as a method}} to evaluate TCMIs at nonclinical stage. Methods: RBL- 2 H 3 cells were used to study the degranulation by co-culture with positive control C 48 / 80 and some TCMIs through morphological and ultra-structure observation, β-hexosaminidase activity detection. RBL- 2 H 3 cell <b>degranulation</b> <b>test</b> was established to detect β-hexosaminidase activity caused by 17 kinds of TCMIs and their ingredients. The cytotoxicity effect of some TCMIs on both RBL 2 H 3 and BRL cells was measured by CCK- 8 assay. Results: Toluidine blue staining and ultra-structure of electronic microscope observation of treated RBL- 2 H 3 cells showed degranulation morphologically. Detection of β-hexosaminidase activity in the supernatant of treated cells showed some TCMIs had elevated enzyme release rates. Further analysis of the ingredients and compound in Tanreqing injection and Shengmai injection showed Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi in Tanreqing injection, Red ginseng and Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis in Shengmai injection were responsible to the degranulation of RBL- 2 H 3 cells. Osmotic pressures and pH influenced RBL- 2 H 3 degranulation. High Osmotic pressure of Tanreqing injection and low pH of chlorogenic acid at 2. 5 and 5. 0 mmol/L congcentration might be responsible to high β-hexosaminidase activity. Most of the TCMIs inducing degranulation had cytotoxicit...|$|E

40|$|Possibility of {{inhibition}} of an efficient in vitro IgE-sensitization system was studied. The sentization of mouse peritoneal mast cells with an anti-ovalbumin IgE-rich fraction of serum, as <b>tested</b> by ovalbumin-induced <b>degranulation,</b> was inhibited by previous incubation with antisera of another or of no specificity. Fractionation and other experiments {{showed that the}} inhibiting activity correlated with IgE content. IgGl {{did not seem to}} have an effect. Sensitization was also inhibited by rat myeloma IgE, 50 ng giving a 50 per cent inhibition. Plots of the logarithms of rat and mouse IgE concentration vs their inhibitory effect on sensitization gave two parallel linear curves, indicating that mouse and rat IgE compete for the same receptor sites. It was thus possible to use this system as a sensitive bioassay for both mouse and rat IgE levels and, by comparing inhibition by mouse IgE to that by a known rat IgE standard, to obtain not only relative data but absolute mouse IgE levels. This, and also a better discrimination of IgE doses, was the major advantage of this bioassay in relation to the equally sensitive anti-IgE <b>degranulation</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Human {{alveolar}} macrophages specifically released lysosomal beta-glucuronidase {{and neutral}} proteases when successively incubated with IgE, and then, for 30 min, with anti-IgE.

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} studies have {{verified}} that minimal change nephrotic syndrome (MCNS) may result from the dysfunction of T cells and B cells, although the precise mechanisms are yet to be elucidated. It is widely recog-nized that MCNS is a T helper (Th) 2 -dominant glomerular disease caused by an imbalanced Th 1 /Th 2 immune response. Increased levels of the Th 2 cytokines, interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 13, have been demonstrated to be closely associated with disease activity. In addition, basophils can affect the Th 1 /Th 2 balance by enhancing the Th 2 response and impairing the Th 1 response, which are then involved in the development of numerous diseases. However, whether basophils are vital in the pathogenesis of MCNS remains unknown. Frequent posi-tivity of the human basophil <b>degranulation</b> <b>test</b> in patients with MCNS has been observed. Thus, basophils should be analyzed in order to determine their role in the pathogenesis of MCNS. Contents 1...|$|E
40|$|Skin {{mast cells}} release the neutral {{protease}} chymase along with histamine during <b>degranulation.</b> To <b>test</b> {{the hypothesis that}} chymase modulates histamine-induced plasma extravasa-tion, we measured wheal formation following intradermal in-jection of purified mast cell chymase and histamine into the skin of ragweed-allergic dogs. We found that chymase greatly augments histamine-induced wheal formation. The magnitude of the potentiating effect increases with increasing doses of chymase and becomes maximal- 30 min after administration. Injection of chymase without histamine does not evoke wheal formation. The chymase potentiation of histamine-induced skin responses is prevented completely by pretreatment with the HI-receptor antagonist pyrilamine, and is prevented by inactivation of chymase with soybean trypsin inhibitor, sug-gesting that both histamine and preserved catalytic activity are required {{for the effects of}} chymase. To examine the effects of histamine and chymase released in situ in further experiments, we measured wheal size following local degranulation of mast cells by intradermal injection of ragweed antigen or compound 48 / 80. We found that pretreatment with either soybean trypsin inhibitor or pyrilamine markedly reduces ragweed antigen- or 48 / 80 -induced wheal formation, supporting the results ob-tained by injection ofexogenous chymase and histamine. These findings suggest a novel and important proinflammatory role for chymase in modulating the effects of histamine on vascular permeability during mast cell activation. (J. Clin. Invest. 1990...|$|R
40|$|In most ascidian species the oocytes are {{surrounded}} by two types of accessory cells called follicle cells and test cells. Test cells are located {{on the periphery of}} oocytes and remain in the perivitelline space during egg development until hatching. Heparin and histamine were previously described in the test cells of the ascidian Styela plicata. in the present study, electron microscopy techniques were used to characterize the ultrastructure of the S. plicata test cells and to localize heparin and histamine in these cells. Test cells contain several intracellular granules with unique ultrastructural features. They are formed by elongated filaments composed of serial globules with an electron-lucent circle, containing a central electron-dense spot. Immunocytochemistry showed that heparin and histamine colocalize at the border of granule filaments in the test cell. Compound 48 / 80, a potent secretagogue of heparin-containing mast cells, also induced <b>degranulation</b> of <b>test</b> cells. According to these results, we suggest that test cells represent ancient effector cells of the innate immunity in primitive chordates. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

40|$|Background: An {{in vitro}} {{elicitation}} test employing human high-affinity IgE receptor-expressing rat mast cell lines {{appears to be}} a useful method for measuring mast cell activation using a patient's IgE and an allergen; however, such cell lines are sensitive to human complements in the serum. We have recently developed a new luciferase-reporting mast cell line (RS-ATL 8) to detect IgE crosslinking-induced luciferase expression (EXiLE) with relatively low quantities of serum IgE. Methods: A total of 30 patients suspected of having egg white (EW) allergy were subjected to an oral food challenge (OFC) test; then, the performances of EW-specific serum IgE (CAP-FEIA), EW-induced degranulation, and EXiLE responses in RS-ATL 8 cells were compared using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The patients' sera were diluted to 1 : 100, which causes no cytotoxicity when sensitizing the RS-ATL 8 cells for the <b>degranulation</b> and EXiLE <b>tests.</b> Results: The area under the ROC curves was highest in the EXiLE test (0. 977), followed by CAP-FEIA (0. 926) and degranulation (0. 810). At an optimal cutoff range (1. 648 - 1. 876) calculated from the ROC curve of the EXiLE test, sensitivity and specificity were 0. 944 and 0. 917, respectively. A 95 % positive predictive value was given at a cutoff level of 2. 054 (fold increase in luciferase expression) by logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: In contrast to in vivo tests, the EXiLE test {{appears to be a}} useful tool in diagnosing patients suspected of having IgE-dependent EW allergy without the risk of severe systemic reactions...|$|R

40|$|Clinical {{symptoms}} of immediate-type hypersensitivity (ITH) and specific IgE against Echinococcus granulosus antigens are frequently present {{in patients with}} hydatid cysts. In alveolar echinococcosis (AE) due to E. multilocularis, clinical manifestations related to ITH have never been reported. The IgE-dependent humoral immune response was evaluated in 30 patients with AE. Circulating specific IgE (sIgE) were determined with two different methods of radio-allergo-sorbent test. Serum sIgE were determined sequentially in 18 patients over 15 months. Specific IgE bound to circulating basophils were assessed with two tests in vitro, measuring specific degranulation and histamine release. The respective abilities of E. granulosus and E. multilocularis antigens to reveal bound and circulating IgE antibodies were also assayed. Despite the absence of clinical {{symptoms of}} ITH and the frequent lack of circulating sIgE, an immunological response involving IgE was always present in human AE: basophil-bound sIgE were revealed in every patient by histamine release and degranulation tests; these tests were constantly negative in control subjects. Echinococcus granulosus extracts were more effective for detecting circulating sIgE; however E. multilocularis antigenic preparation induced a histamine release significantly higher than E. granulosus extracts. These results suggest that IgE-dependent humoral immune response could {{play a role in}} the host-parasite relationship in AE. Moreover, the sensitivity of the tests used to detect basophil-bound sIgE was higher than that of the usual serological tests, and the basophil <b>degranulation</b> <b>test</b> could be used to confirm diagnosis of AE in endemic countries...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of rabbit basophils to antigens from Ixodes ricinus females {{has been studied}} by a <b>degranulation</b> <b>test.</b> Observations of basophil numbers and degranulation were made on the 6 th day of each of four sequential infestations. Maximal degranulation of cells was observed after challenge of cells with antigen at a concentration of 10 6 and 10 7 pg/ml. At these concentrations, during a 1 st infestation, 21. 8 and 23. 6 % of cells degranulated. During a 2 nd infestation, these percentages increased (34. 8 and 33. 8 %) and reached 59. 8 and 63. 8 % by the 4 th infestation. A plasma factor which partially blocks basophil degranulation, is described. This was already present during the 1 st infestation, since in its presence the percentage of degranulation was reduced by 2. 8 and 4. 0 % respectively on challenge with 10 6 and 10 7 pg antigen/ml. Inhibition was maximal at the 4 th infestation (difference: 16. 5 and 20. 5 %). Basophil sensitization and inhibition of the degranulation are thus both progressive phenomena. After 10 – 15 infestations on four other rabbits, 75. 0 and 79. 8 % degranulation was obtained. The inhibition of degranulation by plasma was also greater (difference: 25. 5 and 27. 4 %). IgG specific anti- I. ricinus antibodies were identified by indirect immunofluorescence. In two animals, they were detected at the 6 th day of the 1 st infestation. Subsequently, they were generally present for all the animals...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that simvastatin is capable of blocking human neutrophil degranulation induced by proteinase 3 (PR 3) -anti-neutrophil cytoplasm auto-antibodies (ANCA) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) -ANCA, and by the chemotactic and inflammatory peptide N-formyl-methionine-leucine-phenylalanine (fMLP). Methods: This study was conducted between March 2010 and September 2011 at the Renal Institute of Birmingham, University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purified from the plasma of 20 randomly selected patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis (10 PR 3 - and 10 MPO-ANCA), {{and their ability to}} induce neutrophil degranulation in {{the presence or absence of}} simvastatin (10 μM) was tested. The ability of the same dose of simvastatin to block fMLP-induced neutrophil <b>degranulation</b> was also <b>tested.</b> In addition, the ability of serum obtained from rats that received simvastatin at a dose of 25 mg/kg/day to block neutrophil degranulation in vitro was tested. Results: The addition of simvastatin significantly inhibited ANCA IgG-induced neutrophil degranulation by 48 % (p = 0. 02). There was no significant difference in response to simvastatin inhibition (p = 0. 73) between PR 3 - and MPO-ANCA. Simvastatin also inhibited neutrophil degranulation induced by 1 μM fMLP (30 %, p = 0. 04). We further demonstrated that serum from rats that received simvastatin significantly inhibited neutrophil degranulation induced by ANCA (31. 7 %, p = 0. 01) and fMLP (23. 5 %, p = 0. 03) compared to serum from control animals.   Conclusion: Simvastatin blocked both ANCA and fMLP-induced neutrophil degranulation. It is worth pursuing further therapeutic investigation of statins in vascular inflammatory diseases that involve neutrophil degranulation in their pathogenesis.  </p...|$|R
