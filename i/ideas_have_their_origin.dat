60|$|The 'Essay on Man' is {{the longest}} {{and in some ways}} the most {{important}} work of the third period of Pope's career. It corresponds closely to his early work, the 'Essay on Criticism'. Like the earlier work, the 'Essay on Man' is a didactic poem, written primarily to diffuse and popularize certain ideas of the poet. As in the earlier work these ideas are by no means original with Pope, but were the common property of a school of thinkers in his day. As in the 'Essay on Criticism', Pope here attempts to show that these <b>ideas</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> in nature and are consistent with the common sense of man. And finally the merit of the later work, even more than of the earlier, is due to the force and brilliancy of detached passages rather than to any coherent, consistent, and well-balanced system which it presents.|$|E

First <b>ideas</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> in his graduate student years in the 1970s. Jointly with his brother Thomas Cremer, now professor (chair) of Anthropology and Human Genetics at the Ludwigs-Maximilian University in Munich, Christoph Cremer proposed {{the development of a}} hologram-based laser scanning 4Pi microscope. The basic idea was to focus laser light from all sides (space angle 4Pi) in a spot with a diameter smaller than the conventional laser focus and to scan the object by means of this spot. In this manner, {{it should be possible to}} achieve an improved optical resolution beyond the conventional limit of approx. 200 nm lateral, 600 nm axial. Since 1992, 4Pi microscopy has been developed by Stefan Hell (Max-Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Göttingen) into a highly efficient, high-resolution imaging process, using two microscope objective lenses of high numeric aperture opposing each other.|$|R
40|$|Compressed sensing is a {{new concept}} in signal {{processing}} where one seeks to minimize the number of measurements to be taken from signals while still retaining the information necessary to approximate them well. The <b>ideas</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origins</b> in certain abstract results from functional analysis and approximation theory by Kashin [23] but were recently brought into the forefront {{by the work of}} Candès, Romberg and Tao [7, 5, 6] and Donoho [9] who constructed concrete algorithms and showed their promise in application. There remain several fundamental questions on both the theoretical and practical side of compressed sensing. This paper is primarily concerned about one of these theoretical issues revolving around just how well compressed sensing can approximate a given signal from a given budget of fixed linear measurements, as compared to adaptive linear measurements. More precisely, we consider discrete signals x ∈ IR N, allocate n < N linear measurements of x, and we describe the range of k for which these measurements encode enough information to recover x in the sense of ℓp to the accuracy of best k-term approximation. We also consider the problem of having such accuracy only with high probability. ...|$|R

Its combat meditation methods (Zhan Zhuang) existed in similar forms in Daoism before being integrated into martial arts in later centuries. The whole theory behind [...] "using softness to overcome hardness" [...] and similar <b>ideas</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origins</b> in the Dao De Jing. Daoist concepts are readily implemented into actual training {{in the practice of}} Xing Yi. This can be discerned in the following paragraph by Sun Lutang: “Before training, [...] there is no thought or intention, no figure or image, no self or others, only Qi exists in the chaos of the body. The state is called WuJi in Xing Yi. Without knowing the principle of “inverse motion,” people always rigidly adhered to the principle of the “direct motion nature.” Hence the internal Qi is restrained and things cannot be properly realized due to an obscure mind that causes the body to be weak. They do not know the principle of health that extreme Yang leads to Yin and extreme Yin leads to death. However, sages can be versed in the way of inverse motion, and control the relation between Yin and Yang, manage the principal of creation, direct Liang Yi (another name for Yin and Yang), grasp the key points, {{and go back to the}} pre-natal from the post-natal realm to settle at the original position as the body becomes an integral unit. Its way is nothing more than the principle of stretching and contracting as in post-natal Wu Xing and Bagua boxing. This is called the generation of Qi from WuJi.” ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} whether {{it is possible to}} annihilate elements of local cohomology modules by elements of arbitrarily small order under a fixed valuation. We first discuss the general problem and its relationship to the Direct Summand Conjecture, and next present two concrete examples where annihilators with small order are shown to exist. We then prove a more general theorem, where the existence of such annihilators is established in some cases using results on abelian varieties and the Abel-Jacobi map. 1. Almost vanishing of local cohomology The concept of almost vanishing that we use here comes out of recent work on Almost Ring Theory by Gabber and Ramero [4]. This theory was developed to give a firm foundation to the results of Faltings on Almost étale extensions [3], and these <b>ideas</b> <b>have</b> <b>their</b> <b>origins</b> in a classic work of Tate on p-divisible groups [21]. The use of the general theory, for our purposes, is comparatively straightforward, but it illustrates the main questions in looking at certain homological conjectures, as discussed later in the section. The approach is heavily influenced by Heitmann’s proof of the Direct Summand Conjecture for rings of dimension three [8]. Let A be an integral domain, and let v be a valuation on A with values in the abelian group of rational numbers; more precisely, v is a function from A to Q ∪ {∞} such that (1) v(a) = ∞ if and only if a = 0, (2) v(ab) = v(a) + v(b) for all a, b ∈ A, and (3) v(a + b) � min{v(a), v(b) } for all a, b ∈ A. We will also assume that v(a) � 0 for all elements a ∈ A. Definition 1. 1. An A-module M is almost zero if for every m ∈ M and every real number ε> 0, there exists an element a in A with v(a) < ε and am = 0...|$|R

We then offer an explicit framework for understanding abstraction, one that treats abstraction as a computational process that operates over an innate quality space of fine-grained general representations. We argue that this framework has important philosophical implications for the nativism-empiricism dispute, for questions about the acquisition of unstructured representations, and for questions about the relation between human and animal minds...|$|R

40|$|Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo construir um conhecimento sobre a infÃncia cearense nas primeiras dÃcadas do sÃculo XX, quando circulavam nos meios educacionais novas idÃias sobre a educaÃÃo da crianÃa. Estas idÃias tiveram sua origem no movimento internacional das Escolas Novas â iniciado na Europa e nos Estados Unidos. Tal movimento propunha o rompimento com uma educaÃÃo tradicional de carÃter intelectualista, centrada na figura do professor. Defendia uma pedagogia fundamentada em conhecimentos cientÃficos sobre a crianÃa, um ensino baseado na atividade do aluno que por sua vez deveria ocupar o centro do processo educativo. Enfim, uma educaÃÃo que se apoiava numa nova concepÃÃo de infÃncia. No Brasil, esse novo ideÃrio pedagÃgico foi propagado no primeiro perÃodo republicano, apÃs ter sido aplicado em vÃrias partes do mundo. As novas atitudes em relaÃÃo Ã educaÃÃo da crianÃa foram veiculadas nacionalmente por educadores e intelectuais atravÃs de publicaÃÃes cientÃficas ou de cunho didÃtico; por meio dos programas das Escolas Normais; como tambÃm atravÃs do ciclo de reformas educacionais nos estados brasileiros e no Distrito Federal, ocorrido na dÃcada de 1920, tendo o CearÃ como um dos pioneiros na sua implantaÃÃo. Reconhecendo a importÃncia da chegada dessas idÃias e sua repercussÃo na ambiÃncia {{cultural}} cearense, nossa proposta foi tentar reconstruir o cotidiano de crianÃas que se submeteram Ã educaÃÃo formal em instituiÃÃes escolares, ou mesmo em casa, nos primeiros decÃnios do sÃculo XX. Foi nosso interesse investigar a influÃncia de idÃias escolanovistas na educaÃÃo da infÃncia naquele perÃodo. Na busca desses objetivos enveredamos pelo caminho metodolÃgico da histÃria oral. Confiamos Ã fonte da memÃria o trabalho de nos trazer do passado uma histÃria que nÃo se encontra nos livros. Para tanto, contamos com a colaboraÃÃo de sete depoentes com idade entre 84 e 102 anos que se dispuseram a relatar suas histÃrias de vida com Ãnfase na fase da infÃncia. A partir dos relatos dessas pessoas âcomunsâ, conseguimos desenhar, utilizando as cores da memÃria, a imagem de uma infÃncia cujo cenÃrio possuÃa caracterÃsticas rurais, no qual crianÃa e natureza se confundiam principalmente nos momentos de lazer. Nas narrativas ficou evidente a carÃncia de instituiÃÃes de ensino, embora fossem constantes as promessas governamentais de melhoria na educaÃÃo. Apesar disso, outras alternativas foram encontradas para a educaÃÃo das crianÃas. Nesse campo predominava uma pedagogia tradicional, embora traÃos de novidade fossem identificados nas escolas freqÃentadas pelos depoentes. Constatamos que aquelas idÃias que atravessaram mares atÃ chegar entre nÃs e movimentaram o ambiente cultural cearense, pouco repercutiram no cotidiano escolar e domÃstico de nossas crianÃas. Apesar disso acreditamos que as iniciativas decorrentes destas, nÃo foram em vÃo e sim muito importantes na definiÃÃo de uma nova infÃncia, hoje centro gravitacional de vÃrios campos da ciÃncia, como tambÃm de polÃticas educacionaisThe {{objective of}} this research is to build up some knowledge on the childhood in CearÃ during {{the first decades of the}} 20 th century, when new ideas on children education had arisen in the educational milieu. These <b>ideas</b> <b>had</b> <b>their</b> <b>origin</b> in the international movement of the New Schools â beginning in Europe and the United States. This movement proposed the rupture of the traditional education whose characteristics were the intellectualism and teacher centered education. It defended a pedagogy grounded in scientific knowledge of a child, a teaching based in the student activity, which, on its turn should occupy the center of the educational process; In brief, an education which was based on a new conception of childhood. In Brazil, this set of pedagogical ideas was proposed in the first republican period, after it had been applied in several other parts of the world. The new attitudes in relation to children education were transmitted nationally by educators and scholars through scientific or pedagogic publications; through the teacher preparatory schools, as well as through the educational reform cycles in the Brazilian schools and the Federal District, occurred in the 1920 Âs, being CearÃ one of the pioneers in its implantation. By acknowledging the importance of the arrival of these ideas and its effects in the cultural milieu of CearÃ, our proposal was to try to rebuild the children routine that undergo formal education in schools, or even at home, during the early decades of the 20 th century. It was our goal to investigate the influence of the new-school ideas in children education during that period. In the search of these objectives we set out for the methodological way of the oral history. We rely on the memory of interviewees to bring from the past a history which we can not retrieve in books. Therefore, we counted on the cooperation of seven interviewees aged 84 to 102 years old who were willing to relate the history of their lives with focus to their childhood. From the account of these ordinary people, we managed to trace back the image of a childhood whose scenery had rural characteristics, in which the child and the nature mingled, especially during leisure time. In the narratives, it is evident the lack of educational institutions, though the governmental promises for increase of vacancies in elementary schools were constant. In spite of this, other alternatives were encountered for the children education. In this field, a traditional pedagogy prevailed, even though features of newness were identified in the schools the interviewees went. We certified that those ideas that crossed oceans to reach us and bustled the cultural scene of CearÃ, had little impact in the school routine and the daily life of our children. Despite this, we believe that the actions that occurred afterward were not in vain. They were very important for the definition of a new childhood, which is today the center of interest of several fields in science, as well as educational policie...|$|R
