5|$|History {{may never}} know {{the true story of}} Lee's {{intentions}} at Gettysburg. He never published memoirs, and his after-action report from the battle was cursory. Most of the senior commanders of the charge were casualties and did not write reports. Pickett's report was apparently so bitter that Lee ordered him to <b>destroy</b> <b>it,</b> and no copy has been found.|$|E

5|$|While A.bradleyi {{is easily}} outcompeted by other plants in more fertile habitats, {{it is well}} adapted to the thin, acidic soil and harsh {{environment}} of its native cliffs, where it finds few competitors. Its isolated situation on these cliffs protects it from most threats, but quarrying and mining of the cliffs, rock climbing, and other activities that disturb the cliff ecosystem can <b>destroy</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{the police}} chase the rapidly {{transforming}} Carroon across London, Quatermass analyses {{samples of the}} mutated creature in a laboratory, and realises that it {{has the ability to}} end all life on Earth if it spores. A television crew working on an architectural programme locates the monster in Westminster Abbey, and Quatermass and troops of the British Army rush in to <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> in the hour before it brings about doomsday. Quatermass convinces the consciousness of the three crewmen buried deep inside the creature to turn against it and destroy it; this appeal to the last remains of their humanity succeeds in defeating the organism.|$|E
5|$|By December, {{there was}} still no word of García de Celís, nor had Spanish {{assistance}} arrived from any other direction, and the Spanish at Buena Esperanza had lost hope. They were pressed on all sides by hostile natives, with resistance led by Sicumba. Cerezeda got word of a plan by Sicumba to assault Buena Esperanza and <b>destroy</b> <b>it.</b> In response he sent parties to seize and execute hostile Indian leaders, thus defusing the imminent threat, although Sicumba managed to escape.|$|E

5|$|Centaurs {{typically}} behave with {{characteristics of}} both asteroids and comets. Centaurs {{can be classified}} as comets such as 60558 Echeclus, and 166P/NEAT. 166P/NEAT was discovered while it exhibited a coma, and so is classified as a comet despite its orbit, and 60558 Echeclus was discovered without a coma but later became active, and was then classified as both a comet and an asteroid (174P/Echeclus). One plan for Cassini involved sending it to a centaur, but NASA decided to <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|During {{their field}} trip, the bus from Springfield Elementary {{arrives at the}} Fort Springfield civil war site and skids into a cannon, {{knocking}} one of its wheels off. The cannon then points at the tower leg of a lookout, giving the impression that it will fire at the lookout and <b>destroy</b> <b>it,</b> which is {{a reference to the}} opening sequence of the television sitcom F Troop. The lookout was also modeled after the lookout in the show. The scene in which Üter is left behind {{at the end of the}} field trip is based on a scene from the 1965 film Von Ryan's Express.|$|E
5|$|During {{this same}} time, however, Sadashiva—who felt insulted by Kanhopatra's refusal—sought {{the help of}} the Badshah (king) of Bidar. Hearing tales of Kanhopatra's beauty, the Badshah ordered her to be his concubine. When she refused, the king sent his men to get her by force. Kanhopatra took refuge in the Vithoba temple. The {{soldiers}} of the king besieged the temple and threatened to <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> if Kanhopatra was not handed over to them. Kanhopatra requested a last meeting with Vithoba before being taken.|$|E

5|$|Elements {{of the two}} armies {{initially}} collided at Gettysburg on July 1, 1863, as Lee urgently concentrated {{his forces}} there, his objective being to engage the Union army and <b>destroy</b> <b>it.</b> Low ridges to the northwest of town were defended initially by a Union cavalry division under Brig. Gen. John Buford, and soon reinforced with two corps of Union infantry. However, two large Confederate corps assaulted them from the northwest and north, collapsing the hastily developed Union lines, sending the defenders retreating {{through the streets of}} the town to the hills just to the south.|$|E
5|$|Halleck then relayed the {{contents}} of Lincoln's letter to Meade in a telegram. Despite repeated pleas from Lincoln and Halleck, which continued over the next week, Meade did not pursue Lee's army aggressively enough to <b>destroy</b> <b>it</b> before it crossed back over the Potomac River to safety in the South. The campaign continued into Virginia with light engagements until July 23, in the minor Battle of Manassas Gap, after which Meade abandoned any attempts at pursuit and the two armies took up positions {{across from each other}} on the Rappahannock River.|$|E

The villagers, conditioned by long-term prejudice against Dalits, refuse to play if Kachra joins the team. Bhuvan chastises the villagers, shaming them into accepting Kachra.|$|E

5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours. Not for nothing have we scored 18 goals against two (both of them freaks) conceded in five ties all away from home. What can I say to do justice to that {{brilliant}} goalkeeper Gil Merrick, to wonderful young Trevor Smith and to the matchless Jeff Hall and Ken Green? Once again they mixed the old cement and constructed that brilliant wall of a defence. Sunderland would have needed to call in a firm of demolition contractors to <b>destroy</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
