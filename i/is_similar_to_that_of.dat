40|$|Four meteor spectra are {{analyzed}} for chemical composition and radiative processes. The chemical compositions of the Taurid, Geminid, and Perseid meteors <b>were</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> {{of a typical}} stony meteorite. The chemical composition of the sporadic meteor <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a nickel iron meteorite. The radiation from optical meteors <b>was</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a low temperature gas, except that strong, anomalous ionic radiation is superposed on the neutral radiation in bright, fast meteors...|$|R

5|$|A archaeological {{study in}} 2010 {{revealed}} that {{the layout of the}} rock-cut caves in the temple <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> other rock-cut temples such as the Rockfort and Pechipalai cave temple. The unfinished caves in the temple, along with the lower cave temples in Tiruchirappalli and Tiruparankunram, each have a shrine for Shiva in the east and Vishnu in the west, separated by a central bay between them.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows {{in the dark}} with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5|$|An {{oxide layer}} forms around {{beryllium}} that prevents further reactions with air unless heated above 1000°C. Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming {{a mixture of}} beryllium oxide and beryllium nitride. Beryllium dissolves readily in non-oxidizing acids, such as HCl and diluted H2SO4, but not in nitric acid or water as this forms the oxide. This behavior <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> aluminium metal. Beryllium also dissolves in alkali solutions.|$|E

30|$|Now, {{since the}} {{estimates}} for JKI, JKN and JKSP <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of JKM, also estimates of JI, JN and JSP <b>are</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of JM, therefore using {{a very similar}} argument, it can be easily shown that JKI, JKN, JKSP iterative schemes converge faster than JI, JN, JSP iterative schemes.|$|R
5|$|Another known form {{of solid}} {{tetravalent}} americium chloride is KAmF5. Tetravalent americium {{has also been}} observed in the aqueous phase. For this purpose, black Am(OH)4 was dissolved in 15-M NH3F with the americium concentration of 0.01 M. The resulting reddish solution had a characteristic optical absorption spectrum which <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> AmF4 but differed from other oxidation states of americium. Heating the Am(IV) solution to 90°C {{did not result in}} its disproportionation or reduction, however a slow reduction was observed to Am(III) and assigned to self-irradiation of americium by alpha particles.|$|E
5|$|Churring: The {{purpose of}} this sound <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the chirp. It may {{resemble}} a growl. Zoologist Jonathan Kingdon considered the chirp of the cheetah as similar to the soft roar of the lion, and its churr as the latter's loud roar. The churr, is staccato and has a shorter range than the chirp. A study showed that churrs comprise 3to 15 separate pulses and last 0.1to 1.3 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} average length of the human menstrual cycle <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no {{relation}} between the two. The relationship is believed to be a coincidence. Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans. A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle.|$|E

The {{calligraphy}} <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> other hieratic manuscripts of the New Kingdom; the text is written in horizontal lines across wide columns (often the column size corresponds {{to the size of}} the papyrus sheets of which a scroll is made up). Occasionally a hieratic Book of the Dead contains captions in hieroglyphic.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{is often}} {{performed}} alone, but L. colubrina may also {{do so in}} large numbers {{in the company of}} hunting parties of giant trevally and goatfish. This cooperative hunting technique <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and holes, and the trevally and goatfish feeding on fleeing prey.|$|E
5|$|In Shin Megami Tensei II, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} the gladiator Hawk, who is able to {{communicate}} with demons. The gameplay <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the first Shin Megami Tensei: the game is controlled from a first-person view, and has the player exploring dungeons and navigating outdoor areas, which are presented as 2D maps seen from a top-down perspective. In both these types of areas, the player encounters and battles against demons; a gauge {{on the bottom of the}} screen shows the likelihood of a demon encounter.|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There {{is a significant}} increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|It is {{the only}} Roman helmet ever found in Britain that still has most of its silver-gilt plating attached. The helmet would {{originally}} have had two cheekpieces attached via holes in front of its ear guards. It has a prominent browguard, the shape of which <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the 3rd-century Guisborough Helmet, discovered in 1864 near Guisborough in Redcar and Cleveland. The rear of the helmet bowl descended to form a neckguard.|$|E
5|$|Its {{external}} morphology <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Holochilus brasiliensis, {{and over}} the course of its complex taxonomic history it has been confused with that species, but other features support its placement in a distinct genus, Lundomys. Within the family Cricetidae and subfamily Sigmodontinae, it is a member of a group of specialized oryzomyine rodents that also includes Holochilus, Noronhomys, Carletonomys, and Pseudoryzomys.|$|E

5|$|MFGM is a {{structurally}} complex bioactive milk component, {{found in}} human milk {{as well as}} the milk of other mammalian species. The MFGM in human milk contains many bioactive components with diverse functions and has been linked to cognitive and health benefits to infants. Some compositional differences are reported to exist between species, but bovine MFGM, the best-studied non-human source, generally contains a lipid and protein composition, which <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> human MFGM.|$|E
5|$|MFGM may {{be capable}} of {{modulating}} immune function in the gut through distinct but potentially complementary mechanisms. Glycosylated proteins (MUC-1, MUC-15, butyrophilin, and lactadherin) and glycosylated sphingolipids from MFGM may promote the development of healthy gut microbiota by favoring beneficial Bifidobacterium species. Another key to the immunomodulatory function of MFGM may be that its structure <b>is</b> <b>similar</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the intestinal cell membrane, allowing human milk glycans (including those on glycoproteins and glycolipids) to competitively inhibit the binding of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, even toxins) to host cells.|$|E
