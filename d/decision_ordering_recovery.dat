40|$|The order {{penetration}} point (OPP) {{determines the}} point at which the customer enters the supply chain (SC) with their individual product-related preferences. The OPP therefore separates the demand-driven parts from customer order-driven parts in the SC. Another concept - the <b>order</b> <b>recovery</b> point (ORP) - is also frequently used in practice to determine the last stage at which the customer's individual preferences can be taken into account. Therefore the ORP determines the stage where the customer leaves the SC. This paper introduces the ORP concept and investigates the issue of how to determine the ORP's location in the SC. We analyse the factors which influence the ORP location and propose a formula for its location. The results of this study can be applied as a strategic decision-making support of the ORP location determination and provide deeper insights into SC efficiency and agility from the point of view of ORP location. supply chain integration; ORP location; <b>order</b> <b>recovery</b> point; postponement; supply chain agility; supply chain efficiency; supply chain management; SCM; agile supply chains...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Boolean Satistifiability has {{attracted}} tremendous research effort in recent years, {{resulting in the}} developments of various efficient SAT solver packages. Based upon their design architectures, researchers have tried to develop better heuristics to further improve its efficiency, by either speeding up the Boolean Constraint Propagation (BCP) procedure or finding a better <b>decision</b> <b>ordering</b> (or both). In this paper, we propose an entirely different SAT solver design concept that is circuit-based. Our solver is able to utilize circuit topological information and signal correlations to enforce a <b>decision</b> <b>ordering</b> that is more efficient for solving circuit-based SAT problem instances. In particular, for unsatisfiable circuit examples, our solver is able to achieve from 2 x {{up to more than}} 75 x speedup over a state-of-the-art SAT solver. I...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades there has been a {{proliferation}} of epidemiological models with ordinary derivatives replaced by fractional derivatives in an an-hoc manner. These models may be mathematically interesting but their relevance is uncertain. Here we develop an SIR model for an epidemic, including vital dynamics, from an underlying stochastic process. We show how fractional differential operators arise naturally in these models whenever the recovery time from the disease is power law distributed. This can provide a model for a chronic disease process where individuals who are infected for a long time are unlikely to recover. The fractional <b>order</b> <b>recovery</b> model is shown to be consistent with the Kermack-McKendrick age-structured SIR model and it reduces to the Hethcote-Tudor integral equation SIR model. The derivation from a stochastic process is extended to discrete time, providing a stable numerical method for solving the model equations. We have carried out simulations of the fractional <b>order</b> <b>recovery</b> model showing convergence to equilibrium states. The number of infecteds in the endemic equilibrium state increases as the fractional order of the derivative tends to zero. Comment: 32 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
