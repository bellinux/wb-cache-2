30|$|Potential {{migrants}} do {{not prefer}} countries with higher GDP per capita; on the contrary, {{the effect is}} actually negative and significant. On the other hand, {{the positive effect of}} average life satisfaction indicates that respondents tend to select destinations where the average subjective well-being of the population is higher. Columns 3 and 4 include a measure of perceived corruption and personal freedom in the destination locations. Potential migrants exhibit a preference for countries with lower perceived corruption, while perceived freedom has no significant effect on the choice of the <b>destination</b> (<b>column</b> 5).|$|E
30|$|Algorithm 3 {{gives the}} basic steps for the {{proposed}} implementation of the RAR operation. As has been mentioned previously, in the first phase, each processor (x,y) sends a read request to the processor holding all the information required for calculating {{the intensity of the}} pixel (x^',y^') in the previous frame Ĩ_n - 1 where x^' = f(x,y) and y^' = g(x,y) by (4). Since, x^', y^' may not be integers, they should be rounded to nearest integers and thus, the request is sent to the processor (x_int,y^") which is close to the position (x^',y^') as will seen later. Also, by viewing the hypercube of N^ 2 nodes as a two dimensional mesh N × N, routing of this request can be performed by using the well known technique of X - Y routing. First, the x-coordinate is corrected and the packet is routed horizontally toward the <b>destination</b> <b>column</b> and then the packet is routed vertically to the final destination. After, the read request has arrived the processor (x_int,y^"), the second phase starts and the processor (x_int,y^") gathers all the pixels needed for estimating the intensity Ĩ_n - 1 (x^',y^') for all processors (x,y) which sent read-requests to that processor. Then, it sends these pixels back to the above processors (x,y) by reversing the steps of the X - Y routing of the first phase. In what follows, we give the details of these steps.|$|E
50|$|The Alcantara river park (Parco fluviale dell'Alcantara) was {{established}} in 2001 {{for the protection of}} the river, and to encourage its use as a relaxation area and tourist <b>destination.</b> The <b>columns</b> and surroundings can be seen in the film Tale of Tales.|$|R

50|$|Movement in line {{formation}} {{was very}} slow, and unless the battalion was superbly trained, {{a breakdown in}} cohesion was virtually assured, especially {{in any kind of}} uneven or wooded terrain. As a result, line was mostly used as a stationary formation, with troops moving in column formations and then deploying to line at their <b>destination.</b> Usually, <b>columns</b> would be adopted for movement and melee attacks.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the first}} theorems on {{permutation}} routing, proved by V. E. Beness (1965), shows that given a set of source-destination pairs in an N-node butterfly network with at most a constant number of sources or <b>destinations</b> in each <b>column</b> of the butterfly, there exists a set of paths of lengths O(log N) connecting each pair such that the total congestion is constant. An analogous theorem yielding constant-congestion paths for off-line routing in the shuffle-exchange graph is proved here. The necklaces of the shuffle-exchange graph play the same structural role as the columns of the butterfly in Beness' theorem...|$|R
50|$|CULTUREs {{editorial}} coverage includes {{profiles of}} significant {{individuals in the}} medical-cannabis community (scholars, activists, patients, advocates, etc.) as well as news, legal advice, event previews, music, a <b>Destination</b> Unknown travel <b>column,</b> strain and edible reviews, CD/DVD/film/book reviews, recipes, photo galleries and an extensive events calendar. The magazine also highlights users who have overcome life-threatening ailments in their monthly Profiles in Courage segment. Artists, entertainers and celebrities that have appeared on CULTUREs covers have included Snoop Lion, Dita Von Teese, Mike Epps, Tegan and Sara and Melissa Etheridge, in addition to noted cannabis advocates and icons such as Sanjay Gupta, Bill Maher, and Tommy Chong.|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} of the size effects, the two dummies become {{negative}} though not statistically significant in column (2). This suggests that there may be other reasons—different from higher efficiency—which may also give rise to a large size. In such a case, larger establishment size per se may not imply greater demand for more educated workers unless combined with other characteristics such as non-local destination market. We test this hypothesis in column (3) by introducing an interaction term between size and non-local destination market. The coefficients for large size conditional on selling most of their output in non-local markets are now positive and significant. Large firms employ workers with higher average schooling, only as long as they orient their production to the national or international markets. Conversely, large establishments oriented towards the local markets employ significantly less-educated workers. Coefficients for <b>destination</b> markets in <b>column</b> (3) show the same pattern as in column (2).|$|R
50|$|The list {{at the top}} of the Media Sets {{category}} {{panel has}} a line for each Media Set that can be used as a backup <b>destination.</b> The line <b>columns</b> show the Media Set name, the Media Set type—Disk/Tape/File/etc., the total number of files saved in existing Members, the total bytes used in existing Members, the total bytes free in existing Members, the total bytes capacity in existing Members, the current number of Members of the Media Set, and a bar graph of percent used. The List View Toolbar can be used to Add or Remove a Media Set or to Locate and open its Catalog File; it can also be used to perform additional utility functions on a Media Set. The Scope Bar can be used to restrict the list to Tape or Disk or Optical or File Media Sets. The buttons on the detail pane are used to show a Summary and Backups for a Media Set, and to define Options (which no longer include a media action) and Members and Bindings for it.|$|R
