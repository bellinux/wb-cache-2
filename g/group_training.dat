The {{training}} of Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator groups began in April 1942, {{with the arrival of}} the 306th Bomb Group flying B-17s. From March 1942 through April 1944, Wendover AAF hosted twenty newly formed B-17 and B-24 groups during one phase of their <b>group</b> <b>training.</b> The Second Air Force organized bombardment training into three phases. In the first, training focused on the individual crew members. In the second, training involved the whole crew, who would conduct training together. The third and final phase saw the group's crews training together, with formation flying and practice combat missions. Until the end of 1943, each phase of training was conducted at a different base.|$|E

In the spring of 1980 the Soviets split the senior elites into 2 groups – those who were on the Olympic squad and those that weren't.

25|$|The Royal Air Force {{has a large}} {{operational}} fleet that fulfils various roles, {{consisting of}} both fixed-wing and rotary aircraft. Frontline aircraft are controlled by Air Command, which is organised into three groups defined by function: 1 Group (Air Combat), 2 Group (Air Support) and 22 <b>Group</b> (<b>training</b> aircraft and ground facilities). In addition 83 Expeditionary Air Group directs formations in the Middle East and the 38 Group combines the expeditionary combat support and combat service support units of the RAF. Deployable formations consist of Expeditionary Air Wings and squadrons—the basic unit of the Air Force. Independent flights are deployed to facilities in Afghanistan, the Falkland Islands, Iraq, and the United States.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} week of June 1941 the group {{transferred}} to Jackson Army Air Base, Mississippi to receive an influx of personnel just graduated from technical schools and to train a large levy of drafted enlisted men, mostly from Pennsylvania, fresh out of basic training. The first combat crews joined the group on 2 September, consisting of 30 newly commissioned pilots of Randolph Field Pilot Training Class 41-F, who began <b>group</b> <b>training</b> in seven B-18s and two PT-13 Kaydets. The next month the group began receiving new B-26 Marauders, and by 1 December 1941 each bomb squadron had 13 assigned.

The ground personnel landed at Port Moresby on 23 June 1943 after a month at sea, while the air crews trained at Charters Towers until October. 38 new B-25G aircraft began field modifications at Townsville on 24 September and were flown by their crews to Durand on 9 and 10 October. The new squadrons flew their first combat mission on 15 October 1943.|$|E
25|$|On 30 June 1973, Carrier Division 3 was redesignated Carrier Group 3.

30|$|The GVCA method {{based on}} {{horizontally}} <b>grouped</b> <b>training</b> set is {{as shown in}} Algorithm  2. Meanwhile, regarding the problem of too high eigenvector dimension of training set, a feasible approach is to group the features, i.e., to randomly group a feature set into several non-intersecting subsets, and project the originally integral training set into those feature sets, thereby composing several new <b>grouped</b> <b>training</b> sets. After that, the original VCA method is used to obtain vanishing component polynomial respectively, and finally, the vanishing component polynomial in multiple <b>grouped</b> <b>training</b> sets is combined into the vanishing component polynomial in an integral training set. This approach is called the vertical grouping method. The GVCA method based on vertically <b>grouping</b> <b>training</b> sets is as shown in Algorithm  3. Furthermore, to handle both problems of over-scaled training set and too high eigenvector dimension, the horizontal and vertical grouping approaches can be applied simultaneously.|$|R

2500|$|The MTPs, ATM, ATI, NTW and CRO {{provide a}} picture of {{military}} theory as it evolved before D Day. Reports after 6 June show changes in theory and show the flaws in Home Forces and 21st Army <b>Group</b> <b>training.</b> There is little evidence in the documents of a frank acknowledgement of the failings of British tanks in North Africa and material criticising equipment is absent perhaps because the War Office and higher commands thought that admitting inadequacies would affect morale. On 25 June 1944, Montgomery stopped the circulation of after-action reports because they were [...] "unduly influenced by local conditions", a euphemism for accurate reports on the challenges faced by the British in Normandy. A report by Lieutenant-Colonel A. H. Pepys of 19 June, included comment that German Tiger and Panther tanks outclassed Cromwell and Sherman tanks as badly as Panzer III and IV tanks against Crusaders and Honeys [...] in 1941. The passage was suppressed before the report was passed to the War Office and SHAEF. The effect of the censorship was limited because word of mouth was unstoppable; when the 107th RAC, part of the 34th Tank Brigade reached Normandy, visitors from the 11th Armoured Division said that even their Churchills were outclassed by German tanks and CROs resumed in late July.|$|E

From results mentioned above, it was found that training of 3 days per week is necessary for getting an effective difference in triglyceride, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and blood sugar levels.

2500|$|On 1 October 1995, John F. Kennedy was {{designated}} {{to be an}} operational reserve carrier and Naval Reserve Force ship with a combined full-time active duty and part-time Naval Reserve crew complement, assigned to the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Kennedy {{would be available to}} deploy with either an active or reserve carrier air wing when mobilized in support of urgent operational requirements. In this capacity, John F. Kennedys new primary function would be to provide a surge capability, and in peacetime, to support training requirements. She would participate in routine fleet exercises, aviator carrier qualifications, and battle <b>group</b> <b>training.</b> The impetus for this initiative was post-Cold War defense spending in the mid-1990s, however, the Naval Reserve was never adequately funded to accomplish major maintenance actions for the Kennedy, further exacerbated by additional defense cutbacks that eliminated Carrier Air Wing Reserve 30 and the downgrading of Carrier Air Wing Reserve 20 to a non-deployable Tactical Support Wing and the return of many of the Reserve's front-line combat aircraft to the active duty force. [...] Following the 11 Sep 2001 attacks on the United States, the Operational Reserve Carrier concept was discontinued and Kennedy was returned to the active duty fleet and placed back in the same maintenance rotation as active duty carriers.|$|E
