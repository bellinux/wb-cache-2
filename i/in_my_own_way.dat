5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way</b> and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet I am told you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> and feel that if I were to actually set eyes upon you, I should instantly exclaim, 'That is he!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|... "How Does It Feel" [...] was {{featured}} as the theme tune to the film. The melody {{had originally been}} written by Lea in 1970 and was brought out of the cupboard for Flame. The song features organ, flute and brass backing in places. [...] "Them Kinda Monkeys Can't Swing" [...] is an up-tempo rock track featuring slide guitar by guitarist Dave Hill. In the film, the song is performed by Flame in their first appearance on screen. [...] "So Far So Good" [...] was used as Flame's first hit. The track was covered by Alice Cooper songwriter Mike Bruce on his 1975 solo album <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> <b>Way.</b> [...] "Summer Song (Wishing You Were Here)" [...] has lyrics based around a holiday romance and {{was featured}} in an in-concert scene in the film. [...] "O.K. Yesterday Was Yesterday" [...] was also featured during an in-concert scene in the film.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{apparent}} allusion to Porter's song, Morrissey's [...] "Speedway", from the 1994 album Vauxhall & I, includes the lines [...] "In <b>my</b> <b>own</b> strange <b>way,</b> I've always been true to you / <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> sick <b>way,</b> I'll always stay true to you".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are two of}} {{the most}} busy men in the country," [...] said he, [...] "and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> small <b>way</b> I have also a good many calls upon me.

60|$|Friday, August 2, 1872.--In the evening, at the theatre, I {{had a great}} laugh. Lord Allcash in Fra Diavolo, {{with his}} white hat, red guide-books, and bad German, was the pièce-de-résistance from a humorous point of view; and I had the {{satisfaction}} of knowing that <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> small <b>way</b> I could minister the same amusement whenever I chose to open my mouth.|$|R
60|$|STREPHON [sulkily {{keeping his}} face averted] Thank you; but I don't {{want to be}} cured. I had rather be miserable <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way</b> than callous in yours.|$|E

5000|$|After the {{war broke}} out with Germany he enlisted in the red army. [...] "I didn't {{even know how to}} fire a gun, but reports of the horrors being perpetrated by Germans against Jews had reached us. We knew what they had done in Warsaw. I was filled with {{feelings}} of vengeance. With all my might I wanted, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> small <b>way,</b> to stop the annihilation of the Jewish people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{determined}} to discover if I had deceived {{myself with a}} superstitious fancy, or learned a fateful fact <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> mysterious <b>way.</b> If it were false, {{no one would be}} made anxious by it; if true, possessing the first knowledge of it would enable me to comfort others. I went privately to town and consulted the famous physician who has grown gray in the study of disease." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kuras said of {{her desire}} to shoot 4 Little Girls, [...] "I was really {{interested}} because <b>my</b> background is <b>in</b> political documentaries ... I always felt {{that one of the}} reasons that I had got into filmmaking was that I wanted to use my craft to be able to say something about the human condition, however I could, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> humble <b>way.</b> For me this was an opportunity to make a small contribution." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And do {{you so much}} crave {{to outdo}} me, an old and tried friend?--and that, as it might be, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way?</b> Shooting is my gift, boy, and no common hand can equal mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's just it," [...] she answered, quickly. [...] "I don't {{like you}} to be so solemn about our 'understanding.' You promised to let me think it all out <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way</b> and in my own time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, then," [...] said Dora; [...] "I {{will attend}} {{to all that}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b> Good-night again, Mr. Haverley;" [...] and with a little nod and a smile, she withdrew her face from his view.|$|E
5000|$|Scientists {{are often}} accused {{of living in}} the [...] "Ivory Tower" [...] and not troubling their mind with realities and apart from my {{association}} with political movements <b>in</b> <b>my</b> juvenile years, I had lived in ivory tower up to 1930. But science and technology are as important for administration now-a-days as law and order. I have gradually glided into politics because I wanted to be of some use to the country <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> humble <b>way.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... "Falsafi {{managed to}} fool both the Shah and the {{military}} authorities and start a campaign against the Bahá’ís that dragged {{the country to the}} edge of disaster. It was Ramadan. [...] noon sermons were broadcast throughout the nation via radio and caused violence and terror in many locations. People killed a few Bahá’ís here and there. Falsafi justified these acts by saying that they increased the Shah’s prestige. I {{had no choice but to}} order him, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> rash <b>way,</b> to refrain from giving further speeches until order was reestablished." ...|$|R
50|$|Swainson {{has become}} a leading Canadian jazz player since the 1980s when he started playing with famous local and visiting acts which include, Tommy Flanagan, Rob McConnell, Ed Bickert, Slide Hampton, James Moody, Jay McShann, Moe Koffman, Lee Konitz, Joe Farrell, George Coleman, and Woody Shaw. He went on to {{collaborate}} with Woody Shaw appearing on two of Woody Shaws recordings: <b>In</b> <b>My</b> <b>Own</b> Sweet <b>Way</b> (<b>In</b> & Out 7003) and Solid (Muse 5329). He also toured with Shaw often in New York and on many European tours.|$|R
6000|$|... 'So? You {{bought me}} from my term of service. I went back to bring things about <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> for I had waited long, and now that I had my hand upon him was in no hurry.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was all my own selfish, distrustful temper, {{wanting to}} have Cocksmoor taken care of <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> and angry at being {{interfered}} with. I see it now--and here this poor girl, that I thought thrown away--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'll conduct my own {{business}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> too!" [...] interposed Uncle Barney. [...] "You get off of this island--all of you--just as quick as you can," [...] and he started as if to raise his gun.|$|E
5000|$|The {{arrival of}} the {{trainees}} in late October has kept me very busy; as the [...] "dean" [...] of the English programs here, I am lost in test scores and averages and in the maze of painfully intricate Army politics and intrigue. I am quite powerful <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> little <b>way</b> and exercise more control over personnel and affairs in general than I had ever suspected I would; over my private telephone I contact headquarters, switching people here and there, waiting, listening, planning. I'm sure I will leave my duty here a completely mad tyrant whose niche in civilian life will be non-existent. In its <b>own</b> lunatic <b>way,</b> this is very entertaining...After a year in Puerto Rico (as of 25 Nov), I find that {{the positive aspects of}} that year outweigh the negative. Although this seems like a great cliché, I can say that I have learned a vast amount about humans and their natures—information which I would have enjoyed having earlier. <b>In</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> curious <b>way</b> I have risen [...] "meteorically" [...] in the Army without having ever been a decent prospect for military life; but I feel that my very peculiar assignment has been responsible. The insanity and unreality of Puerto Rico itself has been interesting at all times that it was not overwhelming. (great agreement errors in this sentence, I fear). Please write. Ken.|$|R
5000|$|That was true, of course, … I was jealous—all that money? I'd been {{assigned}} the Clutter case by Harper & Row until {{we found out}} that Capote and his cousin , Harper Lee, had been already on the case in Dodge City for six months. … That book did two things. It made true crime an interesting, successful, commercial genre, but it also began the process of tearing it down. I blew the whistle <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> weak <b>way.</b> I'd only published a couple of books at that time—but since it was such a superbly written book, nobody wanted to hear about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Kitticut," [...] cried poor Rinkitink, [...] "you must save me {{from being}} {{captured}} by these, my subjects. What! must I return to Gilgad and {{be forced to}} reign in splendid state when I much prefer to eat and sleep and sing <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> quiet <b>way?</b> They will make me sit in a throne {{three hours a day}} and listen to dry and tedious affairs of state; and I must stand up for hours at the court receptions, till I get corns on my heels; and forever must I listen to tiresome speeches and endless petitions and complaints!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} quite settled myself; and when I do I mean to work entirely <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> and shall {{say nothing about}} it until I {{come to you and}} say I have succeeded, or I have failed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You wouldn't have {{believed}} that now, would you?" [...] said Cashel. [...] "Don't look startled; you've no bones broken. You had your little joke with me in your own way; and I had mine <b>in</b> <b>MY</b> <b>own</b> <b>way.</b> That's only--" ...|$|E
60|$|In her turn, Helen Burns {{asked me}} to explain, and I {{proceeded}} forthwith to pour out, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> the tale of my sufferings and resentments. Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening.|$|E
40|$|I am indeed {{overwhelmed}} by the honour you all have bestowed upon me for choosing me to deliver this prestigious oration- doubly so for also having elected me to the highest {{office of the president}} of the society about a decade ago. I have chosen to speak on mental health programmes & legislation and take you through a journey from post– independence period to the current scenario in terms of trials and tribulations which these programs underwent and I as a clinician, teacher and a member of the society witnessed, experienced, reacted and contributed to <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> humble <b>way.</b> I have divided my oration into four parts or periods...|$|R
5000|$|Berch usually {{began his}} {{program with a}} whistle and a song. In {{an article in the}} January 1949 issue of Radio and Television Mirror, he gave the reason for that: [...] "I was reading the morning paper. Suddenly I {{realized}} that the whole front page was full of disaster -- fires, murders, political troubles, jealousy and strife between persons and between nations. ... 'Now,' I said to myself, 'something ought to be done about this. And, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> small <b>way,</b> I'm the guy to do it.' Then and there, in theory at least, the Heart to Heart Hookup and the Good Neighbor Club came into being." ...|$|R
60|$|Had I lacked imagination, had I been stupid, had I been stubbornly mulish <b>in</b> having <b>my</b> <b>own</b> <b>way,</b> I {{should never}} have got in this pickle. And the lads and lassies were dancing, {{and there was no}} one to save me from my fate. How much I drank I do not know. My memory of it is of an age-long {{suffering}} of fear in the midst of a murderous crew, and of an infinite number of glasses of red wine passing across the bare boards of a wine-drenched table and going down my burning throat. Bad as the wine was, a knife in the back was worse, and I must survive at any cost.|$|R
