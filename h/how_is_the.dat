25|$|<b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{enormous}} {{diversity in}} the shape, color and sizes of flowers established? There is enormous variation in the developmental program in different plants. For example, monocots possess structures like lodicules and palea, that {{were believed to be}} analogous to the dicot petals and carpels respectively.It turns out that this is true, and the variation is due to slight changes in the MADS-box genes and their expression pattern in the monocots. Another example is that of the toad-flax, Linaria vulgaris, which has two kinds of flower symmetries: radial and bilateral. These symmetries are due to epigenetic changes in just one gene called CYCLOIDEA.|$|E
25|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not and cannot be wholly scientific. It is always a matter of interpretation. For example, if A, who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will and leaves land situated in Barsoom to C, who is domiciled in Catilage, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> issue to be classified? One might say that any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia, the lex loci actus. Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law, the lex loci domicilii. Also, {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex situs, as the law of the place of the land. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action.|$|E

500|$|In 1890 at the {{formation}} of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA), Stanton was elected president. She left such duties to Susan B. Anthony and instead traveled to Europe for two years. While there she met with women who shared her views, and she gathered critical observations about the place of woman in the Bible. In Greenbank, Bristol, Stanton met with English suffragist Helen Bright Clark, and spoke to a group about the Bible position of woman. Clark questioned whether Stanton's liberal views had shocked some in attendance, and Stanton replied: [...] "Well, if we who do see the absurdities of the old superstitions never unveil them to others, <b>how</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> world to make any progress in the theologies? I am in the sunset of life, and I feel it to be my special mission to tell people what they are not prepared to hear..." ...|$|E

[...] Considered a spoof of television clip shows, the episode is seen drawing attention to prevailing televisual conventions and reminds viewers that The Simpsons itself participates actively in that same cultural legacy.|$|E

2500|$|The fell has {{a summit}} plateau which consist of many heather-covered hummocks, {{drystone}} walls and clumps of trees. Well-known Lake District writer Alfred Wainwright credits Grange Fell {{as a single}} fell with three main summits, namely Brund Fell, King's How and Ether Knott. The lesser known Ether Knott is now identified as the highest point at a height of 419metres (1,375feet) [...] and is less frequently visited by walkers. [...] Brund Fell is at 415metres (1,363feet) while King's <b>How</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> best viewpoint and has an altitude of 392metres (1,286feet). On the other hand, another Lakes walking expert Bill Birkett lists Brund Fell and King's How as separate fells in his “Complete Lakeland Fells” volume, while Mark Richards includes all three.|$|E
