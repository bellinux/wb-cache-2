50|$|According to Nicolescu, {{transdisciplinarity}} {{is nevertheless}} radically distinct from multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity {{because of its}} goal, {{the understanding of the}} present world, which cannot be accomplished in the framework of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>research.</b> The goal of multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity always remains within the framework of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>research.</b> If transdisciplinarity is often confused with interdisciplinarity or multidisciplinarity (and by the same token, we note that interdisciplinarity is often confused with multidisciplinarity) this is explained in large part by the fact that all three overflow disciplinary boundaries. Advocates maintain this confusion hides the huge potential of transdisciplinarity.|$|E
50|$|In the CIRET approach, {{transdisciplinarity}} is radically {{distinct from}} interdisciplinarity. Interdisciplinarity, like pluridisciplinarity, concerns {{the transfer of}} methods from one discipline to another, allowing research to spill over disciplinary boundaries, but staying {{within the framework of}} <b>disciplinary</b> <b>research.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Transdisciplinarity {{is defined}} by Basarab Nicolescu through three methodological postulates: the {{existence}} of levels of Reality, {{the logic of the}} included middle, and complexity. In the presence of several levels of Reality the space between disciplines and beyond disciplines is full of information. <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>research</b> concerns, at most, one and the same level of Reality moreover, in most cases, it only concerns fragments of one level of Reality. On the contrary, transdisciplinarity concerns the dynamics engendered by the action of several levels of Reality at once. The discovery of these dynamics necessarily passes through disciplinary knowledge. While not a new discipline or a new superdiscipline, transdisciplinarity is nourished by disciplinary research; in turn, <b>disciplinary</b> <b>research</b> is clarified by transdisciplinary knowledge in a new, fertile way. In this sense, disciplinary and transdisciplinary research are not antagonistic but complementary. As in the case of disciplinarity, transdisciplinary research is not antagonistic but complementary to multidisciplinarity and interdisciplinarity research.|$|E

40|$|Although {{there have}} been {{increasing}} attempts to involve undergraduate students in conducting research, a pivotal moment when students engage in knowledge production is during honours programmes. Honours programmes, particularly those in Australia, seek to develop students 2 ̆ 7 capacity to engage in higher order thinking {{that may lead to}} knowledge production. This transition is facilitated through advanced <b>disciplinary</b> knowledge, <b>research</b> training and a research project. However, there is a pedagogical tension between requiring students to engage in this deeper level of inquiry {{at the same time as}} they complete a heavy knowledge acquisition load. This paper explores how a number of disciplines in Australia balance these elements of the honours curricula. It argues that the combination of these curriculum goals can make it difficult for students to apply the knowledge they have gained in advanced <b>disciplinary</b> and <b>research</b> training courses to their research project work. This has serious implications for honours programmes. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

5000|$|WMSCI is a multi-disciplinary conference where {{participants}} {{focusing on}} one discipline may attend conferences from related areas. According to the organizers, [...] "this systemic approach stimulates cross-fertilization among different disciplines, inspiring scholars, originating new hypothesis, supporting production of innovations and generating analogies, which is ... a fundamental aim in cybernetics".

Their mission statement is as [...] "a forum for focusing into specific <b>disciplinary</b> <b>research,</b> {{as well as for}} multi, inter and trans-disciplinary studies and projects". Some say that its mission is rather opaque (needs a reference). This opaqueness might be perceived from a strictly disciplinary, or sub-disciplinary perspective. WMSCI is intended to be a forum for both 1) inter-disciplinary scholars, researchers, and professionals, and 2) disciplinary researchers who are interested in presenting their <b>disciplinary</b> <b>research</b> and share information and knowledge with researchers from other disciplinary researchers aiming for potential cross-fertilization and analogical thinking, which provide input to logical thinking and/or to empirical hypothesis formulation.|$|E

40|$|This study {{introduces}} the day lighting related solar concentration {{devices such as}} light pipes (or tubular daylight guidance systems), optical fibers for light transport, conventional solar concentrators and luminescent solar concentrators (LSC). The principles of study, advantages and disadvantages for application of these day lighting related devices have been explained. Daylight has a disadvantage {{of not being able}} to reach deeper areas in a building such as storerooms, basements and corridors and it also brings the heat gain with the light. Light pipes and optical fibers were expected to transfer daylight to unreached areas, but light pipes have their difficulties in wiring and the optical fiber needs a pointolite for the light transportation. Solar concentrators are only sensitive for the beam radiation and they function poorly in overcast sky conditions. Even under a clear sky condition, trackers are always needed for conventional solar concentrators. Static concentrators always come with a poor concentration rate without a tracker and the light concentrated by normal luminescent solar concentrators could not be transported by optical fibers to a remote place since the light produced by LSCs is not a pointolite. Future studies especially cross <b>disciplinary</b> <b>researches</b> on developing new solar concentration devices in mitigating those limitations as discussed in this study are highly recommended...|$|R

Dissertation databases were mined to identify 1, 888 tourism-focussed doctoral theses completed between 1951 and 2010.

Overall, psychology, environmental studies and anthropology have informed the greatest number of doctoral dissertations.
