25|$|By the 1820s {{the first}} shaped rolled rails {{had begun to}} be {{produced}} initially of a T shape which required a chair to hold them; the rails were held in position by iron wedges (which sometimes caused the rail to break when forced in) and later by wooden wedges, which became the standard. In the 1830s Robert L. Stevens invented the flanged 'tee' rail (actually a distorted <b>I</b> <b>beam),</b> which had a flat bottom and required no chair; a similar design was the contemporary bridge rail (of inverted U section with a bottom flange and laid on longitudinal sleepers); these rails were initially nailed directly to the sleeper.|$|E

[...] He said that [...] "season two is worth having in your or your kid's SpongeBob collection" [...] given that the episodes [...] "Krusty Love", [...] "Squid's Day Off", and [...] "Mermaidman and Barnacleboy III" [...] are on the set. Jason Bovberg of the DVD Talk wrote that the season release is [...] "recommended." [...] He said [...] "Let me state up front that I adore this show. I get a total kick out of watching it with my 4-year-old daughter. We laugh uproariously at SpongeBob's adventures and I'm helplessly reduced to a boy about her age as <b>I</b> <b>beam</b> and giggle at the screen." [...] However, Bovberg called the included audio commentaries [...] "downright boring." [...] Various celebrities—including Lance Bass of 'N Sync, Will Ferrell of Saturday Night Live, singer-songwriter Tom Waits, and Jerry Lewis—admitted they were fans of the show.|$|E

Historically, the primary framing {{structure of a}} pre-engineered building is an assembly of -shaped members, often referred as I-beams. In pre-engineered buildings, the <b>I</b> <b>beams</b> used are usually formed by welding together steel plates to form the I section. The <b>I</b> <b>beams</b> are then field-assembled (e.g. bolted connections) to form the entire frame of the pre-engineered building.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{recommendations for}} security check of precast beams in transitory phases, compare results of parametric analyzes with {{national and international}} code recommendations and confront the formulations used for the calculation of critical load of lateral instability. In transport and lifting phases, precast beams are susceptible to loss lateral stability because the established supports provides little restriction to the element rotate on its principal axis and move laterally. To recommend limits of slenderness, parametric analysis are performed using formulations based on bifurcacional instability, including eigenvalue problems with the finite element method. The {{results show that the}} safety limits for <b>I</b> <b>beams</b> and rectangular beams are different. For the analyzed cases and with reference to beam slenderness equation used by fib Model Code [13], the limit determined for rectangular beams would be 85 and for <b>I</b> <b>beams</b> 53, which could be taken as 50, as recommended by the code. Within the analyzed cases of <b>I</b> <b>beams,</b> only the fib Model Code [13] recommendation attend the slenderness limit for transitory phases...|$|R

50|$|The {{bridge was}} built in 1870, several decades before the eponymous power plant was built upriver. It {{is one of three}} {{surviving}} 19th-century bridges in Johnson. In 1960, minor repairs were conducted to the abutments, approaches and floor. In 1995, it was recommended to reinforce the deck due to the large number of trucks using the road as a short cut. Steel <b>I</b> <b>beams</b> were installed underneath. In 2000, the bridge was destroyed by a heavy snow load. The roof collapsed and the side walls fell outward into the river below. Because of the installation of the steel <b>I</b> <b>beams,</b> the deck was self-supporting and actually survived. Guardrails were put up {{on the sides of the}} deck to keep the bridge open while its fate was decided. In 2002, the contracting company of Blow & Cote was hired to reconstruct the bridge, which was reopened on June 29, 2002.|$|R

50|$|Also {{known as}} wood and steel mats or steel frame mats. These mats are {{commonly}} made of spruce, pine, fir {{or a combination}} thereof encased in a steel frame. The frame is normally <b>I</b> <b>Beam</b> or HST steel. The steel is used to strengthen the mats, enabling the manufactures of the mats to build them in larger sizes and to support more weight compared to all other types of mats. Common sizes are 8' x 20', 8' x 30', and 8' x 40'. One great advantage is the ease of repairing the wooden inserts which gives new life to an already long lasting and durable mat. This method of repair can be completed on both <b>I</b> <b>Beam</b> and HST style mats.|$|E

50|$|This station {{underwent}} three renovations. The {{first took}} {{place with the}} opening of a Gimbels department store directly above in the early 1970s. The renovation took place mostly in the fare control areas. The second renovation was completed by 1986 as part of a move to prevent the existing New York City Subway stations from falling apart after years of deferred maintenance; this is evidenced by the addition of the then standard orange platform edge in addition to the yellow platform edge that was originally there, as well as painting the <b>I</b> <b>Beams</b> red instead of the original blue and fixing all the other parts of the station. The third renovation was completed by Fall 2004. It consisted of repainting the <b>I</b> <b>beams</b> from red to dark blue, as well as the removal of train arrival devices on the upper level that gave notices of approaching express trains on the lower level, among other things; the latter were replaced with countdown clocks, on both levels, which performed the same function.|$|R

However, despite some early commercial success, there were problems with reliability and manufacture stopped in 1992.|$|R
