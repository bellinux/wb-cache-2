5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released. This version is almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the original, with the only difference being that some early shots were Spears dances {{in front of the}} multicolored background are replaced by shots of Spears with a short blonde bob wig wearing a purple dress and in front of a black background with flashing lights.|$|E

5|$|Certain serpins spontaneously {{undergo the}} S to R {{transition}} without having been cleaved by a protease, {{to form a}} conformation termed the latent state. Latent serpins are unable to interact with proteases and so are no longer protease inhibitors. The conformational change to latency is not <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the S to R transition of a cleaved serpin. Since the RCL is still intact, the first strand of the C-sheet has to peel off to allow full RCL insertion.|$|E

5|$|Perfect Dark was {{developed}} over {{a course of}} nearly a year and its game engine was completely re-written from scratch to support several Xbox 360 features. Therefore, although the game plays <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the original, the code and renderer is different. The game received generally favorable reviews. Some critics considered the relatively unchanged game to be outdated, but most agreed that the title was a solid revival of a classic. As {{of the end of}} 2011, the game had sold nearly 410,000 units. In 2015, the game was included in the Rare Replay video game compilation for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) publishes yearly {{reports of}} the highway's annual average daily traffic (AADT), with counts usually taken near intersections. In 2011, the route's AADT was 310vehicles, taken from a point {{to the west of}} the US277/US377 intersection. This count was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the one taken in 2010, which in turn was a {{decrease}} from the count taken in 2009, when RE2's AADT count was 440vehicles. No portion of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of {{silver in the}} Earth's crust is 0.08parts per million, almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> that of mercury. It mostly occurs in sulfide ores, especially acanthite and argentite, Ag2S. Argentite deposits sometimes also contain native silver when they occur in reducing environments, and when in contact with salt water they are converted to chlorargyrite (including horn silver), AgCl, which is prevalent in Chile and New South Wales. Most other silver minerals are silver pnictides or chalcogenides; they are generally lustrous semiconductors. Most true silver deposits, as opposed to argentiferous deposits of other metals, came from Tertiary period vulcanism.|$|E

5|$|The tournament {{began on}} the episode aired November 9, 2009, and playing in order from the lowest to the highest seed, tournament contestants played {{one at a time}} {{at the end of that}} episode and the next nine. The rules were <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> they were for a normal million dollar {{question}} under the clock format introduced the season before, except here, the contestants had no lifelines at their disposal. Each contestant received a base time of 45 seconds. For each question they had answered before walking away, the contestants received any unused seconds that were left when they gave their answers. The accumulated total of those unused seconds was then added to the base time to give the contestants their final question time limit.|$|E
5|$|Introduced as {{a direct}} {{challenge}} of corporate rival McDonald's, the Big King was Burger King's response to the Big Mac and had a similar style and taste. The sandwich was originally introduced in 1993 under the name Double Supreme during its testing stage. The name was switched to Big King when it was introduced nationally in 1997, and again to the King Supreme when reintroduced in 2002. The sandwich was discontinued in the North American market in the mid-2000s. In November 2013, Burger King brought the Big King back to the North American market as a permanent menu item. The Big King sandwich's recipe is <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the original 1990s recipe, including a three-piece roll. The Big King sandwich is also sold {{in many of the}} company's international markets in several forms.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{had scored}} 203 runs in three innings {{at an average}} of 101.50, but was not selected, nor was middle-order batsman Harvey, who had scored a century in the {{previous}} Test against India. Harvey struggled to adapt to English conditions at the start of his first tour and made only 83 runs at 16.60 in five innings on tour. Brown, who had scored 527 runs at 75.28 for the season so far, including three centuries in his last three innings, was played out of position in the middle-order, even though he had batted as an opener in every tour match other than against Worcestershire. Due to the rotation policy in the tour matches, only two of the three openers Brown, Morris and Barnes played in any one game while the other rested, except when Bradman tried to fit all three in a full-strength team by having Brown in the middle-order. The team was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> for the opening fixture against Worcestershire.|$|E

5|$|The Washington Post {{columnist}} Dana Milbank {{wrote in}} his 2010 book Tears of a Clown, that Beck had been baited by Eiland-Hall to confirm {{the importance of the}} United Nations. Alexander Zaitchik came to a similar conclusion in his 2010 book Common Nonsense, and pointed out the discrepancy between Beck's criticism of the United Nations as part of a New World Order with Beck's subsequent reliance upon the WIPO where he chose to file the case. The case was cited by Jude A. Thomas in a 2011 article published in the John Marshall Review of Intellectual Property Law. In a discussion of the conflicts between freedom of speech and trademark, Thomas noted that panels of the UDRP have concluded website operators had fair use over domain names even in cases where the name in question was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> that trademarked by the individual filing the complaint to the WIPO.|$|E
5|$|The new candle was {{designed}} by the Allentown firm Alvin Butz Co., the Allentown firm Barry Isett & Associates, and Bethlehem Steel Corp. Supplies were provided by Dugan & Marcon Inc., Eisenhardt Mills, Ingersoll-Rand Co. and Dectis Painting, and the construction done by the Carpenters Union Local 600, Electricians Union Local 367 and the Northampton County Labor Council. It looked almost <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> the old previous candle, with eight flood lights installed to illuminate the white shaft. The candle cost $35,000 to build, but Panto said without the help from volunteers, {{it would have cost}} around $150,000, not including labor. In order to cover the $15,000 shortfall in funds raised, the city sold Christmas cards, posters, ornaments and $10 Peace Candle ownership shares. The first lighting ceremony for the new candle was held November 23, 1990.|$|E
