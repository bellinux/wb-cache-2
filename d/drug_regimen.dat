5|$|CDTM is an {{expansion}} of the traditional pharmacist scope of practice, allowing for pharmacist-lead management of drug related problems (DRPs) with an emphasis on a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach to pharmacy practice in the healthcare setting. The terms of a CPA are decided by the collaborating pharmacist and physician, though templates exist online. CPAs can be specific to a patient population of interest to the two parties, a specific clinical situation or disease state, and/or may outline an evidence-based protocol for managing the <b>drug</b> <b>regimen</b> of patients under the CPA. CPAs have become the subject of intense debate within the pharmacy and medical professions.|$|E
25|$|Each {{of these}} {{medicines}} may have local and systemic side effects. Adherence to medication protocol can be confusing and expensive; if side effects occur, the patient {{must be willing}} either to tolerate them or {{to communicate with the}} treating physician to improve the <b>drug</b> <b>regimen.</b> Initially, glaucoma drops may reasonably be started in either one or in both eyes. Wiping the eye with an absorbent pad after the administration of eye drops may result in fewer adverse effects, like the growth of eyelashes and hyperpigmentation in the eyelid.|$|E

30|$|To summarize, (1) {{patients}} {{were more likely}} to take a mood stabilizer than any other drug; (2) although most {{patients were}} taking polypharmacy, there were no predominant <b>drug</b> <b>regimens</b> even among those taking a stable combination; and (3) most patients with a stable combination take {{a relatively small number of}} drugs daily. The wide variation in <b>drug</b> <b>regimens</b> and numerous possible drug combinations suggest that more evidence is needed to optimize treatment of bipolar disorder.|$|R

2500|$|Both {{active and}} passive {{stretching}} exercises that include hip and knee extension {{should be the}} focus of the program. Stretching the hip into extension and limiting excessive knee flexion avoids placing the rectus femoris in a position of passive insufficiency, thereby maximizing the stretch to the iliopsoas tendon. Strengthening exercises for the hip flexors may also be an appropriate component of the program. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory <b>drug</b> <b>regimen</b> as well as activity modification or activity progression (or both) may be used. [...] Once symptoms have decreased a maintenance program of stretching and strengthening can be initiated. Light aerobic activity (warmup) followed by stretching and strengthening of the proper hamstring, hip flexors, and iliotibial band length is important for reducing recurrences.|$|E
2500|$|A 2011 {{study of}} more than 1,000 {{patients}} with advanced colon cancer found that one in eight was treated with at least one <b>drug</b> <b>regimen</b> with specific recommendations against their use in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. The study focused on three chemotherapy regimens that were not supported by evidence from prior clinical studies or clinical practice guidelines. One treatment was rated [...] "insufficient data to support," [...] one had been [...] "shown to be ineffective," [...] and one was supported by [...] "no data, nor is there a compelling rationale." [...] Many of the patients received multiple cycles of non-beneficial chemotherapy and some received two or more unproven treatments. Potential side effects for the treatments include hypertension, heightened risk of bleeding and bowel perforation.|$|E
2500|$|Resistance to one drug {{within a}} class {{generally}} means resistance to all drugs within that class, but a notable exception is rifabutin: rifampicin-resistance {{does not always}} mean rifabutin-resistance and the laboratory should be asked to test for it. [...] It is only possible to use one drug within each drug class. [...] If it is difficult finding five drugs to treat then the clinician can request that high level INH-resistance be looked for. If the strain has only low level INH-resistance (resistance at 0.2mg/l INH, but sensitive at 1.0mg/l INH), then high dose INH {{can be used as}} part of the regimen. When counting drugs, PZA and interferon count as zero; that is to say, when adding PZA to a four <b>drug</b> <b>regimen,</b> you must still choose another drug to make five. It is not possible to use more than one injectable (STM, capreomycin or amikacin), because the toxic effect of these drugs is additive: if possible, the aminoglycoside should be given daily for a minimum of three months (and perhaps thrice weekly thereafter). Ciprofloxacin should not be used in the treatment of tuberculosis if other fluoroquinolones are available.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDevelopment of anti-retroviral regimens with {{enhanced}} efficacy against brain HIV- 1 {{is essential}} if viral eradication {{is to be}} achieved. To address this, a severe combined immune deficiency mouse model of HIV- 1 encephalitis was used to assay the effect of protease-containing and protease-sparing <b>drug</b> <b>regimens</b> on viral replication in brain macrophages. Here, HIV- 1 -infected human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) are inoculated into basal ganglia, causing a multinucleated giant cell encephalitis reminiscent of human disease.

Treatment with ddI/d 4 T decreased the numbers of infected cells by 75 %, while ddI/d 4 T/amprenavir or ZDV/ 3 TC/ABC diminished infection by 98 %.

40|$|Antiretroviral {{therapy has}} {{dramatically}} improved the prognosis for many patients with HIV infection.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the study of mutation in HIV infection. Combination antiretroviral therapy slows the clinical progression of HIV infection, however drug resistance due to viral mutation is a challenging problem. Some studies have speculated that alternating between <b>drug</b> <b>regimens</b> on a fixed schedule might forestall therapeutic failure. To further analyze this speculation, we consider a model of 64 viral strains with 3 drug combinations to analyze <b>drug</b> <b>regimens</b> to maximise the delay till viral escape. A model predictive control scheme is proposed for determining near optimal switching drug schedules. This technique is compared with an optimal control approach and with the strategy commonly used in clinical practice...|$|R
