5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the <b>incompatibility</b> demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Service-oriented {{computing}} aims at composing independent {{services to}} achieve a common goal. Although very flexible, this independence may result in <b>incompatibilities.</b> A pragmatic approach to overcome such <b>incompatibilities</b> offer adapters. An adapter is again a service which reorganizes the message exchange in a service composition to avoid <b>incompatibilities.</b> Given a set of domain-specific message transformation rules, adapters can be generated fully automatically. This paper presents a graphical user interface to support the systematic design of these transformation rules. ...|$|R

40|$|Speciation {{often results}} from the {{accumulation}} of ``complementary genes,'' i. e., from genes that, while having no deleterious effect within species, cause inviability or sterility when brought together with genes from another species. Here I model speciation as the accumulation of genic <b>incompatibilities</b> between diverging populations. Several results are obtained. First, and most important, the number of genic <b>incompatibilities</b> between taxa increases much faster than linearly with time. In particular, the probability of speciation increases at least {{as fast as the}} square of the time since separation between two taxa. Second, as Muller realized, all hybrid <b>incompatibilities</b> must initially be asymmetric. Third, at loci that have diverged between taxa, evolutionarily derived alleles cause hybrid problems far more often than ancestral alleles. Last, it is ``easier'' to evolve complex hybrid <b>incompatibilities</b> requiring the simultaneous action of three or more loci than to evolve simple <b>incompatibilities</b> between pairs of genes. These results have several important implications for genetic analyses of speciation...|$|R

5|$|According to an {{alternative}} theory, {{popular in the}} earlier 20th century and still represented today, the medieval cultures {{in the area of}} modern Poland are not a result of massive immigration, but emerged from a cultural transition of earlier indigenous populations, who then would need to be regarded as early Slavs. This view has mostly been discarded, primarily due to a period of archaeological discontinuity, during which settlements were absent or rare, and because of cultural <b>incompatibility</b> of the late ancient and early medieval sites.|$|E
5|$|As per Tulsidas, {{there is}} no <b>incompatibility</b> between devotion to Rama and {{attachment}} to Shiva.

In addition, Tulsidas venerates the whole Hindu pantheon. The Ramcharitmanas begins with reverence of Ganesh, Sarasvati, Parvati, Shiva, the Guru, Valmiki and Hanuman. At the beginning of the Vinayapatrika, he bows to Ganesh, Surya, Shiva, Devi, Ganga, Yamuna, Varanasi and Chitrakoot, asking them for devotion towards Rama.|$|E

To address this problem, we present a novel tracing technique to identify the causes of least-privilege <b>incompatibilities</b> (i. e., application dependencies on Admin privileges). Our evaluation on a number of real-world applications shows that our tracing technique significantly helps developers fix leastprivilege <b>incompatibilities,</b> and can also help system administrators mitigate the impact of least-privilege <b>incompatibilities</b> through local system policy changes. ...|$|R
40|$|Hybrid <b>incompatibilities,</b> {{measured}} as mortality and sterility, {{are caused by}} the disruption of gene interactions. They are important post-zygotic isolation barriers to species hybridization, and much effort is put into {{the discovery of the}} genes underlying these <b>incompatibilities.</b> In hybridization studies of the haplodiploid parasitic wasp genus Nasonia, genic <b>incompatibilities</b> have been shown to affect mortality and sterility. The genomic regions associated with mortality have been found to depend on the cytotype of the hybrids and thus suggest cytonuclear <b>incompatibilities.</b> As environmental conditions can affect gene expression and gene interaction, we here investigate the effect of developmental temperature on sterility and mortality in Nasonia hybrids. Results show that extreme temperatures strongly affect both hybrid sterility (mainly spermatogenic failure) and mortality. Molecular mapping revealed that extreme temperatures increase transmission ratio distortion of parental alleles at incompatible loci, and thus, cryptic incompatible loci surface under temperature stress that remain undiscovered under standard temperatures. Our results underline the sensitivity of hybrid <b>incompatibilities</b> to environmental factors and the effects of unstable epistasis. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{two-stage}} approach to civil conflict analysis. Unlike conventional approaches that {{focus only on}} armed conflict and treat all other cases as “at peace”, we first distinguish cases with and without contested <b>incompatibilities</b> (Stage 1) and then whether or not contested <b>incompatibilities</b> escalate to armed conflict (Stage 2). This allows us to isolate {{factors that contribute to}} conflict origination (onset of <b>incompatibilities)</b> and factors that promote conflict militarization (onset of armed violence). Using new data on <b>incompatibilities</b> and armed conflict, we replicate and extend three prior studies of violent civil conflict, reformulated as a two-stage process, considering a number of different estimation procedures and potential selection problems. We find that the group-based horizontal political inequalities highlighted in research on violent civil conflict clearly influence conflict origination but have no clear effect on militarization, whereas other features emphasized as shaping the risk of civil war, such as refugee flows and soft state power, strongly influence militarization but not <b>incompatibilities.</b> We posit that a two-stage approach to conflict analysis can help advance theories of civil conflict, assess alternative mechanisms through which explanatory variables are thought to influence conflict, and guide new data collection efforts...|$|R
5|$|Many {{species are}} {{difficult}} or impossible to distinguish from each other using observable characteristics; laboratory <b>incompatibility</b> tests are often used on pure cultures to reliably determine species. Because of the difficulties posed by routine species identification, the use of DNA sequencing and phylogenetic approaches has become a standard method to help clarify relationships between species. Species differ in their geographical distribution and ecological position, host specificity, microscopic and macroscopic features, and also in their aggressiveness in colonizing wood hosts.

5|$|Plans {{to remake}} the {{original}} game in high-definition first began to form when Ed Fear, a writer and creative producer at game developer Mediatonic, contacted Hato Moa {{about the possibility of}} translating any projects she was involved in to English.

An international remake of Hatoful developed by Mediatonic and published by Devolver Digital made using the Unity game engine—allowing the game to be fully compatible with computers that run Windows Vista, Windows 7 or OS X 10.6, and playable for the first time on those that run Linux or OS X 10.7 or newer—was first revealed to be in development on 6 June 2014, with a formal announcement coming shortly afterwards at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014.|$|E
