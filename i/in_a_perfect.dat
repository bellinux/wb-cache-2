5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> scenario, {{this would}} enable every block {{to be written}} to its maximum life so they all fail at the same time. Unfortunately, the process to evenly {{distribute}} writes requires data previously written and not changing (cold data) to be moved, so that data which are changing more frequently (hot data) can be written into those blocks. Each time data are relocated without being changed by the host system, this increases the write amplification and thus reduces {{the life of the}} flash memory. The key is to find an optimum algorithm which maximizes them both.|$|E
5|$|On September 9, 1965, Koufax {{became the}} sixth pitcher {{of the modern}} era, and eighth overall, to throw a perfect game, the first by a {{left-hander}} since 1880. The game was Koufax's fourth no-hitter, setting a Major League record (subsequently broken by Nolan Ryan). Koufax struck out 14 batters, {{at the time the}} most recorded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game (now tied by Matt Cain). The game also featured a quality performance by the opposing pitcher, Bob Hendley of the Cubs. Hendley pitched a one-hitter and allowed only two batters to reach base. Both pitchers had no-hitters intact until the seventh inning.|$|E

5|$|This {{would have}} also {{marked the first}} perfect game in the Tigers' 110-year history. The 83 pitches thrown before the blown call {{would have been the}} fewest pitches <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> game since 1908. Galarraga's near-perfect game was the first such game since Mike Mussina's bid for a perfect game on September 2, 2001, which was broken up by 27th batter Carl Everett. It was also the third time for a Tigers pitcher to come so close to a perfect game, as Milt Wilcox also missed getting the 27th {{straight}} batter out on April 15, 1983, and Tommy Bridges missed the 27th batter on August 5, 1932.|$|E
5|$|During the Early Middle Ages, Greek {{classical}} {{learning was}} all but lost to the West. However, contact with the Islamic world, where Greek manuscripts were preserved and expanded, soon led to a massive spate of Latin translations in the 12th century. Europeans were re-introduced to the works of Plato and Aristotle, {{as well as to}} Islamic thought. Christian thinkers of the scholastic school, in particular Peter Abelard (1079 – 1142) and Thomas Aquinas (1225 – 1274), combined Aristotelian classification with Plato's ideas of the goodness of God, and of all potential life forms being present <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> creation, to organize all inanimate, animate, and spiritual beings into a huge interconnected system: the scala naturae, or great chain of being.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood played Frank Horrigan in the Secret Service thriller In the Line of Fire (1993), {{directed}} by Wolfgang Petersen and co-starring John Malkovich and Rene Russo. Horrigan is a guilt-ridden Secret Service agent haunted by {{his failure to}} save John F. Kennedy's life. The film was among the top10 box office performers in that year, earning $102million in the United States alone. Later in 1993, he directed and co-starred alongside Kevin Costner <b>in</b> <b>A</b> <b>Perfect</b> World. Set in the 1960s, Eastwood plays a Texas Ranger in pursuit of an escaped convict (Costner) who hits the road with a young boy (T.J. Lowther). Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that the film marked the highest point of Eastwood's directing career, and the film has since been cited {{as one of his}} most underrated directorial achievements.|$|E

5|$|German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer criticised Kant's {{belief that}} ethics should concern {{what ought to}} be done, insisting that the scope of ethics should be to attempt to explain and {{interpret}} what actually happens. Whereas Kant presented an idealized version of {{what ought to be}} done <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> world, Schopenhauer argued that ethics should instead be practical and arrive at conclusions that could work in the real world, capable of being presented as a solution to the world's problems. Schopenhauer drew a parallel with aesthetics, arguing that in both cases prescriptive rules are not {{the most important part of}} the discipline. Because he believed that virtue cannot be taught—a person is either virtuous or is not—he cast the proper place of morality as restraining and guiding people's behavior, rather than presenting unattainable universal laws.|$|E

The song was not adequately receptive in the United States, reaching forty-nine on the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart. Two music videos for the song were shot, the Chris Robinson-directed second version being used as the official video. The video features Hilson at getting ready and enjoying herself at a party, featuring appearances by Monica, Chris Brown, former Pussycat Dolls member Melody Thornton and Omarion, among others. She performed the song {{as a part of}} a medley at the 2009 Soul Train Music Awards.|$|E
25|$|The Meissner {{effect is}} {{sometimes}} {{confused with the}} kind of diamagnetism one would expect <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> electrical conductor: according to Lenz's law, when a changing magnetic field is applied to a conductor, it will induce an electric current in the conductor that creates an opposing magnetic field. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>perfect</b> conductor, an arbitrarily large current can be induced, and the resulting magnetic field exactly cancels the applied field.|$|E

25|$|The third law of {{thermodynamics}} {{states that}} the entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero, or 0 kelvin is zero.

A perfect crystal is one in which the internal lattice structure is the same at all times; in other words, it is fixed and non-moving, and does not have rotational or vibrational energy. This means {{that there is only one}} way in which this order can be attained: when every particle of the structure is in its proper place.|$|E
