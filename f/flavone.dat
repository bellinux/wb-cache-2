In recent years, scientific and public interest in <b>flavones</b> has grown, but there remains insufficient evidence that <b>flavones</b> have any effect in the human body.

40|$|<b>Flavones,</b> the {{secondary}} metabolites of Phellinus igniarius fungus, have {{the properties of}} antioxidation and anticancer. Because of the great medicinal value, there are large demands on <b>flavones</b> for medical use and research. <b>Flavones</b> abstracted from natural Phellinus can not meet the medical and research need, since Phellinus in the natural environment is very rare and is hard to be cultivated artificially. The production of <b>flavones</b> is mainly related to the fermentation culture of Phellinus, which made the optimization of culture conditions an important problem. Some researches were made to optimize the fermentation culture conditions, such as the method of response surface methodology, which claimed the optimal <b>flavones</b> production was 1532. 83 [*]μg/mL. In order to further optimize the fermentation culture conditions for <b>flavones,</b> in this work a hybrid intelligent algorithm with genetic algorithm and BP neural network is proposed.

In the present study, {{it was found that}} C-glycosyl <b>flavones</b> are distributed in different milled fractions of black gram and among these fractions, husk had the highest content of C-glycosyl <b>flavones.</b> Two C-glycosyl <b>flavones</b> from black gram husk were extracted and purified by preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column. The purity of each compound was assessed by analytical C 18 column. The structure of each compound was confirmed by LC–MS/MS, NMR. The molecular mass of these compounds were found to be [M−H]−, m/z 431. 36 and [M−H]−, m/z 431. 35 and were identified as vitexin and isovitexin, respectively.

40|$|Methylation of DNA and histone {{proteins}} {{are mutually}} {{involved in the}} epigenetic regulation of gene expression mediated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and histone methyltransferases (HMTs). DNMTs methylate cytosine residues within gene promoters, whereas HMTs catalyze the transfer of methyl groups to lysine and arginine residues of histone proteins, thus causing chromatin condensation and transcriptional repression, which {{play an important role}} in the pathogenesis of cancer. The potential reversibility of epigenetic alterations has encouraged the development of dual pharmacologic inhibitors of DNA and histone methylation as anticancer therapeutics. Dietary <b>flavones</b> can affect epigenetic modifications that accumulate over time and have shown anticancer properties, which are undefined. Through DNA binding and in silico protein-ligand docking studies with plant <b>flavones</b> viz. Apigenin, Chrysin and Luteolin, the effect of <b>flavones</b> on DNA and histone methylation was assessed. Spectroscopic analysis of <b>flavones</b> with calf-thymus DNA revealed intercalation as the dominant binding mode, with specific binding to a GC-rich sequence in the DNA duplex. A virtual screening approach using a model of the catalytic site of DNMT and EZH 2 demonstrated that plant <b>flavones</b> are tethered at both ends inside the catalytic pocket of DNMT and EZH 2 by means of hydrogen bonding. Epigenetic studies performed with <b>flavones</b> exhibited a decrease in DNMT enzyme activity and a reversal of the hypermethylation of cytosine bases in the DNA and prevented cytosine methylation in the GC-rich promoter sequence incubated with the M. SssI enzyme. Furthermore, a marked decrease in HMT activity and a decrease in EZH 2 protein expression and trimethylation of H 3 K 27 were noted in histones isolated from cancer cells treated with plant <b>flavones.</b> Our results suggest that dietary <b>flavones</b> can alter DNMT and HMT activities and the methylation of DNA and histone proteins that regulate epigenetic modifications, thus providing a significant anticancer effect by altering epigenetic processes involved in the development of cancer...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flavones</b> and isoflavones {{may play}} a {{prominent}} role in cancer prevention since these compounds are found in numerous plants that are associated with reduced cancer rates. This article reviews recent epidemiological and animal data on isoflavones and <b>flavones</b> and their role in cancer prevention. It covers aspects of the bioavailability of these dietary constituents and explores their mechanism of action. Human epidemiology data comes primarily from studies in which foods rich in isoflavones or <b>flavones</b> are associated with cancer rates. This approach has been particularly useful with isoflavones because of their abundance in specific foods, including soy foods. The bioavailability of <b>flavones</b> and isoflavones {{has been shown to be}} influenced by their chemical form in foods (generally glycoside conjugates), their hydrophobicity, susceptibility to degradation, the microbial flora of the consumer, and the food matrix. Some information is available on how these factors influence isoflavone bioavailability, but the information on <b>flavones</b> is more limited. Many mechanisms of action have been identified for isoflavone/flavone prevention of cancer, including estrogenic/antiestrogenic activity, antiproliferation, induction of cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis, prevention of oxidation, induction of detoxification enzymes, regulation of the host immune system, and changes in cellular signaling. It is expected that some combination of these mechanisms will be found to be responsible for cancer prevention by these compounds. Compelling data suggest that <b>flavones</b> and isoflavones contribute to cancer prevention; however, further investigations will b...|$|R
