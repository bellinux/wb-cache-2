5|$|Since the {{establishment}} of the Slovenian league, PrvaLiga, Maribor had the highest average attendance in almost every season to date (21 out of 26). The highest attendance was in the 1996–97 season, when on average 5,289people attended Maribor's matches, which is still a record <b>in</b> <b>Slovenian</b> club football. The highest attendance in a Slovenian league match was on 1 June 1997, when Maribor played against Beltinci (14,000). In addition, they are the first club that gathered over one million people on their matches <b>in</b> <b>Slovenian</b> league since its foundation in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Maribor's {{tally of}} 14 Slovenian Championships {{and the total}} of nine Slovenian Cup titles is the highest <b>in</b> <b>Slovenian</b> football. Maribor holds the record for most {{consecutive}} league titles (7), ahead of Olimpija (4) and Gorica (3). They are also the only team {{in the country that}} has achieved the Slovenian Championship and the Slovenian Cup doubles {{on more than one occasion}} (4). In addition, they are the only club who has won the Slovenian version of the treble, having won the league, cup and supercup during the 2012–13 season. On their official website, UEFA states that Maribor has won one international cup, as Maribor was one of the winners of the UEFA Intertoto Cup in 2006. However, the trophy itself was awarded to Newcastle United, the team that advanced farthest in the UEFA competitions that season. Maribor have the best top-flight record in history, having finished below fourth place only once. In addition, they were the first team to win 1,000 points <b>in</b> <b>Slovenian</b> top flight, achieving that with a 2–1 away victory against Rudar Velenje on 26 July 2008.|$|E
5|$|The old rivalry {{reached its}} peak {{in the final round}} of the 2000–01 season, when one of the most celebrated matches <b>in</b> <b>Slovenian</b> League history was played. Olimpija met Maribor at their home stadium, Bežigrad, and both teams were {{competing}} for their fifth Slovenian League title. The home team needed a win for the title, while a draw was enough for Maribor. The atmosphere was electric days before the kick-off, and the stadium with a capacity of 8,500 was completely sold out. At the end, the match ended with a draw (1–1) and Maribor started to celebrate their fifth consecutive title in front of 3,000 of their fans that gathered in Ljubljana that day.|$|E

5|$|Maribor is {{the most}} {{successful}} club in the country, having won 14 Slovenian PrvaLiga titles, nine Slovenian Cups, and four Slovenian Supercups. The club's most successful period was in the late 1990s and early 2000s, when they overwhelmingly dominated domestic football, winning seven successive league titles and three national cups. Following the 2008–09 season, Maribor became the dominant force <b>in</b> <b>Slovenian</b> football for the second time, having won seven out of nine championships since then. Prior to Slovenia's independence in 1991, Maribor played in the Yugoslav football system, where the club, apart from winning the Yugoslav second division in 1967, had no major successes. They are {{one of only three}} Slovenian teams which participated in the country's highest division, Yugoslav First League, between the end of World War II in 1945 and the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991. In addition, they are the only Slovenian club to have participated in the group stages of the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Olimpija won {{the first}} title. They had a long {{tradition}} of playing in the Yugoslav first league and their squad was still composed of players from that era. Olimpija dominated the league and won a further three championships before Gorica won their first in the 1995–96 season. Following Gorica's success, Maribor won their first championship in 1997. This started a record-breaking streak of seven successive league championships which came to an end when Gorica won their second title in the 2003–04 season. The club from Nova Gorica went on to win an additional two titles, becoming the third club to win three consecutive championships. During the 2006–07 season Domžale, a club that played in the Slovenian second division three seasons earlier, won their first title, a feat they repeated the next season. Following the 2008–09 season, Maribor became the dominant force <b>in</b> <b>Slovenian</b> football for the second time, having won six out of eight championships since then.|$|E
5|$|From the 2007–08 season onwards, former Slovenian internationals Zlatko Zahovič as {{the sport}} director, and soon afterwards, Darko Milanič {{as the head}} coach, were {{appointed}} to head the club's sports department. On 10 May 2008, the club re-opened the renovated Ljudski vrt, which had undergone a major reconstruction that lasted almost 20months. The first match played in the newly refurbished stadium was a league match against Nafta and was won 3–1 in front of 12,435spectators. At the start of 2008–09 season, Maribor entered history books as the first club who won 1,000points in the Slovenian top division, after a 2–1 away win against Rudar Velenje on 26 July 2008. Under the guidance of head coach Darko Milanič, Maribor won all three domestic trophies available to them (the Slovenian League, Cup, and Supercup) in only two seasons with the club, thus becoming the first coach with all three domestic trophies won <b>in</b> <b>Slovenian</b> football. On 12 December 2010, the club celebrated its 50th anniversary. With the 2–1 away victory over Primorje, on 21 May 2011, Maribor secured its ninth Slovenian league title. Four days later the team played the Slovenian cup final at Stožice stadium and lost to Domžale 4–3.|$|E
