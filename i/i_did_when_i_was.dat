He stated: Money {{is the only thing that}} keeps them playing...If they earned the same money as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing they'd have retired at 34 as I did, and Australian cricket would be the better for it.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 March 2015, {{a formal}} {{announcement}} was made, confirming the project, with Ullman {{saying that it}} was a 'privilege to be doing this,' and [...] "I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> six, standing on the windowsill in my mother's bedroom, putting on a show." [...] Shane Allen, controller of comedy commissioning added: [...] "It's about time the Americans gave her back. Tracey has been the missing gem in the British comedy crown for too long. Talent doesn't come much bigger and the BBC audience is in for a huge treat." ...|$|E

The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did. You can't escape it here [...] I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more times today than <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mixing it. Which is a good thing... Ever since the Rihanna song did well, {{a lot of people want}} to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{difference}} between your brother and yourself. Ah! {{you think that}} no answer. Will you have a medical simile? Self-examination notes the symptoms and combats them; self-contemplation does as <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unstrung by that illness at Poonshedagore, and was always feeling my own pulse. It dwells on them, and perpetually deplores itself. Oh, dear! this is no better--what a wretch I am. It is always studying its deformities in a moral looking-glass." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It ain't no use," [...] he {{declared}} flatly. [...] "I thought I could work my way around these snowdrifts, {{the same as}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came over to town after you. But the darkness and this heavy fall of snow is bothering me tremendously." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks!" [...] said Austin. [...] "I suppose in {{one respect}} that's a compliment. Still, I almost think, or, at least, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first went down there, that if I'd known what {{was in front of}} me I'd have stayed in Grand Canary." ...|$|R
