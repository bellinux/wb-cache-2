They argued that even if Congress possessed the authority to regulate purely private agreements, banning defendants' cartel would infringe liberty of contract because the defendants' cartel purportedly set reasonable prices. The defendants' last argument was that their cartel did not directly restrain trade but was simply a partial restraint, which ensured the defendants merely a reasonable rate of return and thus would have been <b>enforceable</b> <b>at</b> common <b>law.</b>|$|R

However, the parties in a building contract do not favour this right in remedying the breach, and similarly there is not much law cases that illustrate the specific performance has been exercised especially in building contract. Hence, this master project has been done to identify the reason for not granting specific performance by the court with respect of building contract. The law cases collected from year 1980 to year 2009 is done mainly through documentary analysis of law journals and law reports via Lexis-Nexis website, e. g. Malayan Law Journal, Building Law Report, Construction Law Report, etc. The results show that there are 7 reasons in which the specific performance will not be granted to the parties in a building contract such as when there is adequacy of legal remedies, constant supervision from the court, uncertainty terms in a contract, on the ground of hardship, vacant possession of site, willingness and readiness as well as whether valid contract has exists or not. This research will shed some light in exposing what are the possible reasons that the court may refuse to grant specific performance and forms a guideline for the parties in a building contract when they resort to specific performance...|$|R

Due to rising disposal costs, some Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) permitted facilities in New Mexico {{are looking for ways}} to reduce the volume of water produced during purging and are exploring alternative sampling techniques. As a result, purging and sampling techniques for compliance groundwater monitoring have become an important issue for both facilities and the regulatory agency. The Hazardous Waste Bureau (HWB) of the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) developed the following guidance regarding low-flow and other non-traditional sampling methods to promote clarity and consistency. This HWB position paper is intended to provide guidance to the regulated community and assist with preparation of written requests to HWB for sampling deviations based on site-specific conditions. The selection of a sampling technique depends on well and site conditions. HWB outlines the selection criteria for low-flow well purging and sampling in this document.

40|$|This {{study is}} of two {{remedies}} {{that are available}} in South African law: orders of restitutio in integrum, and specific performance. The study demonstrates that, by treating these remedies as legal topics in their own right, a greater understanding emerges of their inherent characteristics, the role that they play in the law, and of the particular circumstances in which these remedies are available. An order of restitutio in integrum performs an important and unique function in South African law. The fundamental realisation {{is that it is}} a remedy in terms of which the courts exercise an extraordinary and discretionary power, and nullify ab initio legal transactions, or the legal consequences of events, which were previously perfectly valid and <b>enforceable</b> <b>at</b> <b>law.</b> Because of the extraordinary nature of this remedy, the circumstances in which it is available are limited by the requirement that iusta causa must exist to justify nullification. Further, before the remedy is available, the person seeking relief must have suffered loss or prejudice as a resuli of the event complained of. Finally, a mutual restoration of benefits received by the persons involved is required. The nature and effect of orders of restitutio in integrum, and the essential elements which determine the availability of the remedy, enable it to be distinguished from, and contrasted with, other remedies in South African law. An order of specific performance is available in South African <b>law,</b> <b>at</b> the option of a plaintiff, to enforce the actual performance of contractual undertakings. The remedy is appropriate to enforce positive undertakings, as well as acts of restraint. For the remedy to be available, it is firstly necessary that a contractual obligation be proved to exist. Secondly, performance of that obligation must be due. Thirdly, the performance sought must not in fact have already been rendered. These elements determine the availability of the remedy in particular factual circumstances, such as in cases involving pre-emptive rights. The nature and characteristics of the remedy are determined by principles of South African, and not English law. The remedy is available as of right in South African law, but subject to a discretionary power of a court to refuse to order specific performance.

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2007. One of {{the major}} policy {{objectives}} of the South African government is to reform land tenure and address the current inequitable dispossession of land. A key to the successful implementation of land reform in communal areas will be the recently enacted Communal Land Rights Act. This Act allows communities to be vested with juristic personality, and enables those communities to acquire and hold rights, incur obligations, and encumber the land by mortgage {{in the name of}} the community. Communities will now have a legal tenure recognized by and <b>enforceable</b> <b>at</b> <b>law.</b> The Act provides the mechanism for replacing old order rights with new order rights, which, in turn, may be upgraded to freehold title with community consent. While the Communal Land Rights Act is clear in its approach to providing legal security of tenure, the implementation and linking of the internal land rights within these new legal collective ownership structures to the existing formal system is still uncertain. With the flexibility allowed under the Act, this dissertation offers a simple, cost-effective alternative for the registration of land rights using the envisioned Land Clerk of the Department of Land Affairs. This option involves placing suitably equipped Land Clerks into the communities in which they serve, operating as autonomous self-sustaining contractors. Research for this project was conducted in the community of Ekuthuleni (KwaZuluNatal), where two members of the community were equipped with a portable rig and trained to perform as Land Clerks. The author and others from the University trained them in the use of a computer, scanner, printer, handheld GPS receiver, and assorted software. In addition, to allow them to function autonomously, a photovoltaic power system was set up at their residence. To assess their ability as Land Clerks, several field projects were undertaken within the community. Under the guidance of the author, these field tests involved contacting individual landowners, capturing personal and property information, and registering that data into a specially written database programme. Evidence of previous land ownership was noted and rebristered, GPS coordinates were collected and registered in the process of delineating the landowner's property, and a form reflecting all captured data was printed for the landowner's records...|$|R
40|$|According to {{an often}} quoted saying a gentleman’s {{agreement}} is an agreement {{which is not}} <b>enforceable</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> and binding only {{as a matter of}} honour. Honour, so the saying suggests, does not belong to the province of civil law. However, on second thoughts this suggestion may appear to be not very accurate. This is so, in the first place, since the anthropology of law reveals that for instance in mediaeval Europe between the ninth and the thirteenth century honour in connection with the ownership and defence of land was considered as property in the agro-pastoral society. In the second place, honour plays a prominent role as a legally protected interest in defamation and libel, and slander cases. Although in such cases compensation for personal injury is usually placed at the forefront, the proprietarian element (e. g. the loss of good name may lead to a loss of goodwill in business) is quite often also at stake. The same is true for those legal regimes such as the Dutch one, that protect the moral rights of authors under copyright law. Modern Dutch practice shows that gentleman’s agreements are commonly used as substitutes for contracts to structure long term continuing commercial relations. Although the parties completely agree on all the terms of a contract, they also agree that this does not lead to legal consequences but is binding in honour only. Indeed these gentleman’s agreements reflect the parties intention not to be bound in law as an expression of the autonomous ordering process which is quintessential for contract law. Businessmen often find that contracting is not needed because of relational sanctions. A party that is acting infra honore will be sanctioned socially in its field of trade; it will be stigmatized and set aside. The notion honour should not be taken to literally in this respect though. It refers to the customs and practice common to a particular trade. So what may be called dishonorable in one trade may not necessarily also be dishonorable in other business relations. Moreover under the circumstances dishonorable conduct may be judged by private governments referring to particular codes of conduct. The fact that the parties declare expressis verbis to stay outside the domain of the law {{does not mean that the}} law is of no importance at all. Gentleman’s agreements are made in the shadow of the law. This is particularly true in those instances that they accompany contracts. When long term relations collapse, contract law and legal action will often come into play. What then if such a case occurs, will be the answer given by Dutch legal doctrine and case law to the question of the legal status of gentleman’s agreements? It appears that the answer will be far from clear cut and can be split up in a general and a specific part. General is the part which refers to the intention of the parties and the requirements of contract law for a contract to be validly concluded. Both legal doctrine and case law clearly accept that the freedom of contract includes the freedom of the prospective parties to agree staying outside the domain of the law, and that the discretionary power of the courts entails mitigating the requirements of contract law. The key issue seems to be that the constituent elements of a contract: offer and acceptance, as well as the contract itself are juridical acts. Being essential for juridical acts to aim at legal consequences no juridical act exists if such aim is lacking. So it appears that the gentleman’s agreement as a legal concept again functions in the shadow, this time in the shadow of the contract. Gentleman’s agreements are would-be contracts. What does this finding mean for the binding force of the agreed issues in a gentleman’s agreement? Case law tend to follow here the view taken by Wessels and others that these separate agreements ought to be considered as naturalis obligationes. They are not <b>enforceable</b> <b>at</b> <b>law</b> as long as they are not performed. Further – and here comes the specific part of the answer to the question about the legal status of gentleman’s agreements into play – taking into account some or all of the factors enumerated in section II. B (nr. 19) may lead the court in a particular case to the conclusion that what is presented as a gentleman’s agreement really is a contract. This all concerns the internal effect of gentleman’s agreement – the relation between the parties. But the mere existence of a gentleman’s agreement may have as well an external effect, leading to legal consequences based on other than contractual liability, e. g. tortuous liability...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{self-determination}} has with time incrementally {{evolved from a}} political principle to an <b>enforceable</b> right <b>at</b> <b>law.</b> The right to self-determination is today considered {{to be one of}} the essential principles of contemporary international law. The rapid dissolution of colonialism has not diminished the significance of this right and therefore peoples continue and will continue to make demands to attain self- determination. The need for clarification of the content of the right to self-determination stems essentially from the desire to maintain the, sometimes conflicting, UN principles of peace and justice. Evidently, there is an absence of a coherent set of rules relating to the interaction of the right to self-determination with other international norms. With the global 'War on Terror' being afforded continuous attention, it is imperative that liberation fighters and liberation conflicts are readily distinguishable from terrorists and terrorism. The legitimate cause of the peoples does not automatically legitimate the means and methods utilised. Therefore, there is a need to examine, in particular, the jus ad bellum and the jus in bello applicable when peoples actively pursue their right to self-determination. The purpose of this paper is to observe the interaction between the right to self- determination and other named international law norms. To that end this thesis will examine the use of force and the laws of war provisions that apply in national liberation conflicts. The thesis includes a discussion of the content and scope of the right to self- determination in international law. The recognition of national liberation movements and the consequences of such recognition will also been examined...|$|R
40|$|The legal {{personality}} (or capacity) is an attribute that can {{belong to the}} participators in international relations. It divides {{all the members of}} international society into two groups. First of them consists of entities, that enjoy the {{legal personality}} - we describe them as subjects of international law. In this group belong states, intergovernmental organisations (so called IGOs) and a group of various other units, e. g. The Holy See or the Sovereign Order of Malta. The second group is composed from the entities without legal personality under international law. Here we could find wide group of non-governmental organisations and strong supranational corporations. They may possess significant political power and heavily influence deciding of the states and intergovernmental organisations, they may have legal personality under municipal law but they do not enjoy the legal personality under the international public law. The legal personality is defined as possessing rights and duties <b>enforceable</b> <b>at</b> <b>law.</b> It means, that the subject under international law can conclude agreements, can enter into diplomatic relations (enjoys so called right of legation), can submit claims and act before international court or judge, has right to enjoy immunities for itself and for its representatives, can become a member of international organisation or become a party of international convention and also has to hold the responsibility for own unlawful actions. International organisations, as a subject of international law, enjoy the legal personality different from the personality of member states. There is no doubt about the legal personality of European Communities. Every of the three charters founding the European Coal and Steal Community, European Community and Euroatom includes explicit provision, that the founded organisation enjoys legal personality. Looking at the Maastricht and as well at the Amsterdam treaty, we cannot find any smilar provision concerning the legal personality of European Union. The issue of whether the Union has legal personality is disputed. The prevailing view is been that it was not the will of the member states to give the Union legal personality. Expert opinion generally maintains that an international organisation such as the European Union doesn't have the legal personality unless its founders confer such personality on it expressly. In contradistinction to the original treaties about Communities the member states in Maastricht treaty did not acknowledged the personality of Union. Article 24 and 38 of the Treaty of the European Union (added by the Treaty of Amsterdam) give the Council of the European Union the capacity to conclude international agreements. But this competence is strictly limited only on areas covered by the Common Foreign and Security Policy and Police and Judicial Cooperation in Criminal Matters and only when it is necessary to implement those titles. The legal effects of such agreement apply only on member states individually and according to the terms and conditions laid down by national law. Regarding this provision the European Union must be seen as a Union of States without legal personality of its own under international public or domestic law, which, when it takes action at international level, does so on the behalf of the member states on not on his own account. The question of legal personality was comprehensively researched by the European Convention. There was created a working group on legal personality. The group examined the matter closely and for the purpose heard the views of a number of experts. In the final report that was brought into open in October 2002 the working group recommended conferring explicit legal personality on the Union. The single legal personality, according to the opinion of working group, should replace the existing legal personalities. The question of legal personality was one of the "simple" issues discussed by Convention. The working group on legal personality has finished its search quite early (comparing with other working groups) and the final report was established on broad consensus. ...|$|R
