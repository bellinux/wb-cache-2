5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity {{with regard to their}} possible asexuality. Individuals go through a series of emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E
5|$|Dubstep's early {{roots are}} in the more {{experimental}} releases of UK garage producers, seeking to incorporate elements of drum and bass into the South London-based 2-step garage sound. These experiments often {{ended up on the}} B-side of a white label or commercial garage release. Dubstep is generally instrumental. Similar to a vocal garage hybrid – grime – the genre's <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> commonly dark; tracks frequently use a minor key and can feature dissonant harmonies such as the tritone interval within a riff. Other distinguishing features often found are the use of samples, a propulsive, sparse rhythm, and an almost omnipresent sub-bass. Some dubstep artists have also incorporated a variety of outside influences, from dub-influenced techno such as Basic Channel to classical music or heavy metal.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm really proud of it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> a great achievement.|$|E

5|$|Code: Veronicas story, setting, {{and artistic}} design strayed {{away from the}} series standard. While {{previous}} games are set in the United States and have a corresponding American feel to them, Code: Veronica {{is set in the}} Southern Ocean and Antarctica and carries a European gothic horror inspired design. This is made clear in the environments which features gothic architecture and art in addition to central European carvings and German-style weaponry. In addition, the gothic <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> emphasized through the story. The horror in Code: Veronica is driven by this story which follows a crazed man and the fate of his noble bloodline. The story is told partly through a lullaby, and this method of story telling is intended to bring out European operatic undertones. This contrasts to previous games in the series which were driven by the panic elements from American horror films, such as monsters and zombies. With regards to managing the art staff, Mikami split them up depending on their interests. Those interested in guns worked solely on gun designs while those interested in environments were sent to photograph houses and castles for research.|$|E

25|$|The {{goals of}} the Classmate PC project and the OLPC project have some differences.

25|$|This {{model is}} even more {{approximate}} than the model of hydrogen, because it treats the electrons in each shell as non-interacting. But the repulsions of electrons {{are taken into account}} somewhat by the phenomenon of screening. The electrons in outer orbits do not only orbit the nucleus, but they also move around the inner electrons, so the effective charge Z that they <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> reduced by the number of the electrons in the inner orbit.|$|E
25|$|When a team {{is awarded}} a penalty, {{they are given}} the choice of taking a {{two-point}} penalty kick from {{the point that the}} offence took place, or attacking with a set of six tackles in the hope of scoring a four-point try. Depending on the proximity to the goal posts and other circumstances of the game, the team's captain will choose which option they <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> the more appropriate. As with other goals, the kick must pass both over the crossbar and between the uprights of the goal-posts.|$|E

25|$|The Salinas {{prepare to}} attend a ball, {{one of the most}} {{important}} of the Palermo social season. The Prince is both excited and concerned about the evening to come. It will be the first time Angelica and her beauty are to be presented to the public. However, he remains concerned that Don Calogero will make a complete fool of both himself and the Salinas. When Angelica (looking beautiful) and Don Calogero (looking acceptable) arrive shortly after, Angelica, thanks to detailed training in etiquette given to her by Tancredi, makes a huge social success. The Prince, after being satisfied that Angelica has been accepted, wanders through the rooms of the Palazzo Ponteleone where the ball is being held, becoming increasingly gloomy at the callowness of the young men, the boredom in the older men, and the silliness of the girls. The Prince notices Tancredi and Angelica dancing happily together, oblivious to the other's desperation, ambition, and greed. As he watches, the Prince comes to realize and accept, if only for a moment, that whatever happiness the lovers <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> to be celebrated, no matter what.|$|E

25|$|Task Review - The losing {{team are}} {{subjected}} to a more detailed, extensive review of their performance in the boardroom, with Lord Sugar and his advisers being more openly critical of any team member's performance on the task, particularly those who performed poorly or contributed very little, while candidates argue their case for staying in the competition, often highlighting others in their team and countering any criticism they receive that they <b>feel</b> <b>is</b> unfounded. Once discussions are brought to an end, the team's project manager for the task is asked to select two candidates from their team to accompany them into for a final boardroom discussion, {{with the power of}} their choice meaning that anyone can be selected, whether they were responsible for the failure of the task or considered to be by the PM, or are someone whom the PM has issues with such as personality clashes. Those not picked are sent back to the candidates' accommodation for that series, while Sugar and his advisers have a private discussion amongst themselves about the PM and their choices after the group are told to wait outside the boardroom; if the team only consists of two or three candidates, they are simply told to step outside {{at the end of the}} team's discussion period.|$|E
