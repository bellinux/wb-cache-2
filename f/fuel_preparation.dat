50|$|Low-carbon {{power comes}} from {{processes}} or technologies that, produce power with substantially lower amounts {{of carbon dioxide}} emissions than is emitted from conventional fossil fuel power generation. It includes low carbon power generation sources such as wind power, solar power, hydropower and, including <b>fuel</b> <b>preparation</b> and decommissioning, nuclear power. The term largely excludes conventional fossil fuel plant sources, and is only used to describe a particular subset of operating fossil fuel power systems, specifically, those that are successfully coupled with a flue gas {{carbon capture and storage}} (CCS) system.|$|E
50|$|To {{manufacture}} 1 t of Portland cement, about 1.5 to 1.7 t raw materials, 0.1 t {{coal and}} 1 t clinker (besides other cement constituents and sulfate agents) must be ground to dust fineness during production. In this process, {{the steps of}} raw material processing, <b>fuel</b> <b>preparation,</b> clinker burning and cement grinding constitute major emission sources for particulate components. While particulate emissions of up to 3,000 mg/m3 were measured leaving the stack of cement rotary kiln plants as recently as in the 1960s, legal limits are typically 30 mg/m3 today, and much lower levels are achievable.|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{the quality}} of the ore and the {{consequent}} cost and mass of equipment required to extract it are unknown and can only be speculated. Some economic analyses indicate that the cost of returning asteroidal materials to Earth far outweighs their market value, and that asteroid mining will not attract private investment at current commodity prices and space transportation costs. Other studies suggest large profit by using solar power. Potential markets for materials can be identified and profit generated if extraction cost is brought down. For example, the delivery of multiple tonnes of water to low Earth orbit for rocket <b>fuel</b> <b>preparation</b> for space tourism could generate a significant profit if space tourism itself proves profitable, which has not been proven.|$|E
50|$|In {{its most}} basic form, fuel {{particles}} are suspended in a hot, bubbling fluidity bed of ash and other particulate materials (sand, limestone etc.) through which jets of air are blown to provide the oxygen required for combustion or gasification. The resultant fast and intimate mixing of gas and solids promotes rapid heat transfer and chemical reactions within the bed. FBC plants are capable of burning a variety of low-grade solid fuels, including most types of coal and woody biomass, at high efficiency and without the necessity for expensive <b>fuel</b> <b>preparation</b> (e.g., pulverising). In addition, for any given thermal duty, FBCs are smaller than the equivalent conventional furnace, so may offer significant advantages over the latter in terms of cost and flexibility.|$|E

In order to access its coal reserves, Mepco must pump polluted mine pool {{water out of the}} abandoned Shannopin Mine and Consol Energy's Humphrey mine. The company originally announced that the polluted water would be used as cooling water at the Longview Plant but later abandoned that idea because it was too polluted. Instead, the company provides minimal treatment of the water at its Steele Shaft treatment plant and discharges the water into Dunkard Creek. This water is very high in total dissolved solids and was found by the Pennsylvania DNR to be impairing the aquatic community in Dunkard Creek ...|$|E

50|$|To {{provide a}} black start, some power {{stations}} have small diesel generators, normally called the black start diesel generator (BSDG), {{which can be}} used to start larger generators (of several megawatts capacity), which in turn can be used to start the main power station generators. Generating plants using steam turbines require station service power of up to 10% of their capacity for boiler feedwater pumps, boiler forced-draft combustion air blowers, and for <b>fuel</b> <b>preparation.</b> It is uneconomical to provide such a large standby capacity at each station, so black-start power must be provided over designated tie lines from another station. Often hydroelectric power plants are designated as the black-start sources to restore network interconnections. A hydroelectric station needs very little initial power to start (just enough to open the intake gates and provide excitation current to the generator field coils), and can put a large block of power on line very quickly to allow start-up of fossil-fuel or nuclear stations. Certain types of combustion turbine can be configured for black start, providing another option in places without suitable hydroelectric plants.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{systematically}} {{investigates the}} safety of <b>fuel</b> <b>preparation</b> room containing high pressure fuel gas supply systems {{in order to identify}} shortcomings and practical gaps of the current regulations. A very large ore carrier of 300, 000 DWT was taken as an example and the LNG fuel system was designed for it. An event tree analysis was conducted on the fuel system to identify events that can lead to an explosion. Along with a fault tree analysis model, generic failure data from various sources were used to estimate frequency of potential explosion. For the consequence analysis computational ﬂuid dynamics and ﬁnite element analysis software were used to estimate the impact of explosions on the boundary structure of the <b>fuel</b> <b>preparation</b> room. Research ﬁndings show that the current rules and regulations concerning {{the safety of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>preparation</b> rooms and that the high pressure fuel gas supply system is subject to an unacceptably high level of explosion risk with the frequency of explosion as high as 3. 13 E- 04 per year.

50|$|On 1 September 2016, {{the rocket}} {{carrying}} Spacecom's Amos-6 exploded on its launchpad (Launch Complex 40) while <b>fueling</b> in <b>preparation</b> for a static fire test.

The subsequent investigation showed the root cause to be ignition of solid or liquid oxygen compressed between layers of the immersed helium tanks' carbon-fiber wrappings. To resolve the issue for further flights, SpaceX made design changes to the tanks and changes to their fueling procedure.|$|R

40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) {{currently}} owns {{several hundred}} {{metric tons of}} aluminum clad, spent nuclear fuel and target assemblies. The vast majority of these irradiated assemblies are currently stored in water basins that were designed and operated for short term fuel cooling prior to fuel reprocessing. Recent DOE decisions to severely limit the reprocessing option have significantly lengthened the time of storage, thus increasing the tendency for corrosion induced degradation of the fuel cladding and the underlying core material. The portent of continued corrosion, coupled with the age of existing wet storage facilities {{and the cost of}} continuing basin operations, including necessary upgrades to meet current facility standards, may force the DOE to transition these wet stored, aluminum clad spent fuels to interim dry storage. The facilities for interim dry storage have not been developed, partially because fuel storage requirements and specifications for acceptable fuel forms are lacking. In spite of the lack of both facilities and specifications, current plans are to dry store fuels for approximately 40 to 60 years or until firm decisions are developed for final fuel disposition. The transition of the aluminum clad fuels from wet to interim dry storage will require a sequence of drying and canning operations which will include selected <b>fuel</b> <b>preparations</b> such as vacuum drying and conditioning of the storage atmosphere. Laboratory experiments and review of the available literature have demonstrated that successful interim dry storage may also require the use of fuel and canister cleaning or rinsing techniques that preclude, or at least minimize, the potential for the accumulation of chloride and other potentially deleterious ions in the dry storage environment. This paper summarizes an evaluation of the impact of fuel transitioning techniques on the potential for corrosion induced degradation of fuel forms during interim dry storage...|$|R
