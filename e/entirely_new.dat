5|$|A {{boulevard}} to {{link the}} parks on Chicago's north and south sides was proposed as early as 1891. An early plan called for a tunnel to link Michigan Avenue south of the river with Pine Street (now Michigan Avenue) north of the river.

An <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> secondary express passenger locomotive was required to operate over the main lines throughout the system including those that had relatively short turntables.|$|E

5|$|New genes can be {{generated}} from an ancestral gene when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function. Other types of mutations can even generate <b>entirely</b> <b>new</b> genes from previously noncoding DNA.|$|E
5|$|Shoup {{favored a}} more frugal {{approach}} to the military budget, feeling the military was too susceptible to influence from large corporations arguing for expensive and unnecessary programs.
