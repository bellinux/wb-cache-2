5|$|Despite its troubled {{construction}} period, the Circuit of the Americas {{passed its}} final FIA inspection on 25 September, allowing {{the race to}} go ahead. Sebastian Vettel took his sixth pole position of the season, whilst Alonso struggled throughout qualifying to start the race ninth, which became eighth when Romain Grosjean received a grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change. Amid concerns that drivers starting from even-numbered grid slots would suffer {{from a lack of}} grip as they were located off the racing line, Ferrari deliberately broke the seal on Felipe Massa's gearbox, thereby giving him a five-place grid penalty and promoting Alonso to seventh and the clean side of the grid. Ferrari's fears were not without merit as the drivers starting from even-number spaces fell behind {{at the start of the}} race. Vettel quickly converted pole position into a steady race lead as Lewis Hamilton fought to regain second place from Mark Webber. Moments after Hamilton caught him on lap 17, the Australian suffered yet another alternator problem, and coasted to a halt. Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner later admitted that the team's perpetual alternator problems were a serious concern with just one race left in the championship, a World Championship at stake and very little time to diagnose and correct the problem. With Webber now out of the running, Hamilton then turned his attentions on Vettel and steadily closed the gap to the lead, overtaking the World Championship leader on lap 42 when Vettel got caught behind Narain Karthikeyan in the meandering first sector, which allowed Hamilton to pass Vettel along the long back straight. Hamilton held onto the lead for the final fourteen laps, but with Vettel never more than a second and a half behind him, Hamilton could not afford to relax, and he won the race by just six-tenths of a second. Alonso recovered from seventh to finish third – marking the first time that he, Hamilton and Vettel had stood on the podium together in the one hundred races all three had contested together – and forcing the title fight to extend to the final round in Brazil. Further down the order, Massa overcame his gearbox penalty to finish fourth, while Jenson Button fell from twelfth on the grid to sixteenth at the end of the first lap, using an alternative strategy to claw his way back up to fifth. Michael Schumacher, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>went</b> backwards; after qualifying fifth, his Mercedes chewed through its tyres, forcing him to make a second stop that sent him plummeting down the order to finish sixteenth, and a clutch problem during his stop deprived Kimi Räikkönen of the chance to compete with Alonso for the final podium place. Both Marussia drivers out-qualified the Caterhams for the first time, only for Timo Glock and Charles Pic be out-raced by Heikki Kovalainen and Vitaly Petrov, but the Russian team held onto tenth place in the World Constructors' Championship. Despite losing Webber to an alternator failure, Red Bull collected enough points to secure their third consecutive World Constructors' Championship title.|$|E
25|$|Many, {{though not}} all, artists did stay true to the movement's basic ideas, even after 1931. Rietveld, for instance, {{continued}} designing furniture according to De Stijl principles, while Mondrian continued {{working in the}} style he had initiated around 1920.

Eventually all six received letters of commendation for their participation, but it was 47 years before their vital role in the operation was recognized with decorations. By then only Hoyt and Hopkins remained living, but both personally received Distinguished Flying Crosses on May 26, 1976.|$|E
25|$|Before the {{creation}} of the U.S. Highway system in 1926, most of the proposed routing in Connecticut was part of New England Interstate Route 3 (NE-3). There were two places where NE-3 and US 6 were not overlapped. NE-3 began in Bedford, New York at NY 22, entering Connecticut via modern Route 35. NE-3 continued north to Danbury via the old non-expressway alignment of U.S. Route 7. US 6, on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>went</b> east from Brewster on its current alignment, meeting with NE-3 in downtown Danbury.|$|E
25|$|The Bats wings {{were also}} {{accompanied}} by a clock, which featured a simplified Bats wings design, with the clock face replacing the globe and eyes, and the intrequate lines {{that made up the}} bats wing removed. The noticeable thing about this clock design is the length of the second hand. While the minute and hour hands never went outside the circle at the centre, the second <b>hand</b> <b>went</b> out as far as the bats wings themselves, making the second hand easily twice as long as the minute hand. The clock was occasionally accompanied by the BBC Pips when a programme started on the hour.|$|E

25|$|Instead of {{attending}} the Flames training camp, <b>Hand</b> <b>went</b> to the Edmonton Oilers' training camp {{after they had}} selected him in the 12th round (252nd and last overall) of 1986 NHL entry draft. There he survived the full fourteen days of camp without being cut, despite breaking his one and only stick {{on the first day}} and having to borrow one from Marty McSorley. Playing alongside players such as Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier, he impressed coach Glen Sather and was offered a contract to play Junior Hockey for a year. Suffering from homesickness, Hand turned it down but agreed to return the following year. Hand was the first of only two British born and trained player ever to have been drafted by an NHL team (the second being Colin Shields).|$|E
25|$|Thracian tribes {{remained}} {{divided and}} most of them fell under nominal Persian rule from the late 6th century till {{the first half of the}} 5th century, until King Teres united most of them in the Odrysian kingdom around 470 BC, probably after the Persian defeat in Greece, which later peaked under the leadership of King Sitalces (431–424 BC) and of Cotys I (383–359 BC). At the commencement of the Peloponnesian war Sitalces entered into alliance with the Athenians, and in 429 BC he invaded Macedon (then ruled by Perdiccas II) with a vast army that included 150,000 warriors from independent Thracian tribes. Cotys I on the other <b>hand,</b> <b>went</b> to war with the Athenians for the possession of the Thracian Chersonese. Thereafter the Macedonian Empire incorporated the Odrysian kingdom and Thracians became an inalienable component in the extra-continental expeditions of both Philip II and Alexander III (the Great).|$|E
25|$|On {{receipt of}} this news Menéndez sent Diego Flores in advance with forty {{soldiers}} to reconnoitre the French position; he {{himself with the}} chaplain, some officers, and twenty soldiers rejoined Flores at about midnight, and pushed forward {{to the side of}} the inlet opposite their encampment. The following morning, having concealed his men in the thicket, Menéndez dressed himself in a French costume with a cape over his shoulder, and, carrying a short lance in his <b>hand,</b> <b>went</b> out and showed himself on the river-bank, accompanied by one of his French prisoners, in order to convince the castaways by his boldness that he was well supported. The Frenchmen soon observed him, and one of their number swam over to where he was standing. Throwing himself at his feet the Frenchman explained who they were and begged the Admiral to grant him and his comrades a safe conduct to Fort Caroline, as they were not at war with Spaniards.|$|E

500|$|The story {{takes place}} {{on the high seas}} in the Caribbean during the 17th century during a {{conflict}} among colonists. When a major event occurs, Mike hears the sound of a typewriter in the sky. Mike's reality literally changes each time the author makes a change to the story. Mike realizes that during times when he hears the audible sounds of the typewriter, his actions and words are not of his own volition, and when such sounds are absent he is able to make decisions for himself. Mike {{falls in love with a}} woman in the story, and grows frustrated after realizing that she is just another of Hackett's fictional creations. At the end of the work, Mike returns to New York, and is left with lingering doubts whether he is still a character in someone else's story. He muses whether a [...] "typewriter in the sky" [...] is creating the world. Mike looks up into the sky in search of this mystical device or its controller: [...] "Abruptly Mike de Wolfe stopped. His jaw slackened a trifle and his <b>hand</b> <b>went</b> up to his mouth to cover it. His eyes were fixed upon the fleecy clouds which scurried across the moon. Up there– God?

2500|$|Norwich in {{the late}} 17th century was riven politically. Churchman Humphrey Prideaux {{described}} [...] "two factions, Whig and Tory [...] and both contend for their way with the utmost violence." [...] Nor did the city accept {{the outcome of the}} 1688 Glorious Revolution with a unified voice. The pre-eminent citizen, Bishop William Lloyd, would not take the oaths of allegiance to the new monarchs. One report has it that in 1704 the landlord of Fowler's alehouse [...] "with a glass of beer in <b>hand,</b> <b>went</b> down on his knees and drank a health to James the third, wishing the Crowne [...] well and settled on his head." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to John Richardson in a 2007 Vanity Fair article, [...] "Jason Epstein's {{assessment}} of Silvers as 'The most brilliant {{editor of a}} magazine ever to have worked in this country' has been 'shared by virtually {{all of us who}} have been published by Robert Silvers'". The British newspaper [...] The Guardian called Silvers [...] "the greatest literary editor there has ever been", while Library of America remembered him as [...] "an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America". The New York Times described him as [...] "the voracious polymath, the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction", and, in his obituary, stated that [...] "under his editorship [...] became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers." [...] Author Louis Begley wrote, [...] "the ideal editor of my – and I would guess every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. When I write a piece for his magazine, of course I have the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him. [...] There is no experience quite like it. Bob knows everything that's worth knowing, a consequence of his unflagging curiosity." [...] "Bob's edits are scrupulous, comprehensive, and precise. They are frequently aimed at saving the reviewer's face." [...] Roger Cohen wrote, after Silvers' death, [...] "No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his <b>hand</b> <b>went</b> {{to the heart of the}} matter." ...|$|E
