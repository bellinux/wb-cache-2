40|$|Electrorheology (ER) {{denotes the}} control of {{theological}} characteristics through applied electric field. ER fluids constitute a class of colloids whose viscosity can increase under increasing electric field. Under very strong fields some ER fluids can turn into anisotropic solids, characterized by a yield stress. The recent discovery of the giant electrorheological (GER) effect in suspensions of nanoparticles has challenged the conventional wisdom on ER fluids, as the GER fluids can break the theoretical upper bound on the (high-field state) yield stress. Starting from experimental observations of the GER characteristics, we show that the model of aligned molecular <b>dipole</b> <b>layers</b> in the contact region of coated nanoparticles can yield predictions in excellent agreement with measured data. The statistical mechanics of the aligned <b>dipole</b> <b>layers</b> is studied through Monte Carlo simulations. We propose electrowerting between the particles and the suspending liquid, with hydrogen bonding as a contributing element, in inducing the aligned state. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects that surface <b>dipole</b> <b>layers</b> and surface charge layers along the pore mouth-water {{interface}} can have on the electrical properties of a transmembrane channel. Three specific molecular sources are considered: <b>dipole</b> <b>layers</b> formed by membrane phospholipids, <b>dipole</b> <b>layers</b> lining {{the mouth of a}} channel-forming protein, and charged groups in the mouth of a channel-forming protein. We find, consistent with previous work, that changing the lipid-water potential difference only influences channel conduction if the rate-limiting step takes place well inside the channel constriction. We find that either mouth dipoles or mouth charges can act as powerful ion attractors increasing either cation or anion concentration near the channel entrance to many times its bulk value, especially at low ionic strengths. The effects are sufficient to reconcile the apparently contradictory properties of high selectivity and high conductivity, observed for a number of K+ channel systems. We find that localizing the electrical sources closer to the constriction entrance substantially increases their effectiveness as ion attractors; this phenomenon is especially marked for dipolar distributions. An approximate treatment of electrolyte shielding is used to discriminate between the various mechanisms for increasing ionic concentration near the constriction entrance. Dipolar potentials are far less sensitive to ionic strength variation than potentials due to fixed charges. We suggest that the K+ channel from sarcoplasmic reticulum does not have a fixed negative charge near the constriction entrance; we suggest further that the Ca+ 2 -activated K+ channel from transverse tubule does have such a charge...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn epileptic {{patients}} {{candidate to}} surgery, {{the interpretation of}} EEG signals recorded either within (depth EEG) or at the surface (scalp EEG) of the head is a crucial issue to determine epileptogenic brain regions and to define subsequent surgical strategy. This task remains difficult {{as there is no}} simple relationship between the spatiotemporal features of neuronal generators (convoluted cortical <b>dipole</b> <b>layers)</b> and the electric field potentials recorded by the electrodes. Indeed, this relationship depends on the complex interaction of several factors regarding involved cortical sources: location, area, geometry, and synchronization of neuronal activity. A computational model is proposed to address this issue. It relies on a neurophysiologically relevant model of EEG signals, which combines an accurate description of both the intracerebral sources of activity and the transfer function between <b>dipole</b> <b>layers</b> and recorded field potentials. The model is used, on the one hand, to quantitatively study the influence of source-related parameters on the properties of simulated signals, and on the other hand, to jointly analyze depth EEG and scalp EEG signals.

A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures.

Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers.

Introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, though not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Nevertheless, because of safety concerns, thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and lanthanum.|$|E
30|$|The {{visible light}} {{absorption}} of TiO 2 particles prepared from organic acid-ethanol solution {{can be explained}} as follows: a <b>dipole</b> <b>layer</b> has been formed towards the inner TiO 2 through the carboxyl group binding with the Ti 4 +.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 A new {{experimental}} {{technique for}} the study of atom-surface interactions is obtained by passing an atomic beam containing high-Rydberg states through a fine mesh target. The technique is demonstrated to be a sensitive probe of the electric fields of adsorbed <b>dipole</b> <b>layers</b> in transmission experiments in which a time-dependent beam reduction is attributable to field-ionization of the high-Rydberg atoms. A thermal-energy Li beam, excited by electron impact to states with principal quantum numbers near n = 35, is passed through a 2. 1 -μm-thick gold mesh with 6. 45 -μm square holes. The fraction of excited atoms surviving passage through the target shows a decrease to a minimum as a function of time, followed by a rise to a final constant value. The rate of these changes is unaffected by changes in the Li flux, is decreased by an increase of the mesh temperature, and seems to be increased with a higher residual gas pressure. A model of the time dependence of the transmission based on field-ionization of the high-Rydberg atoms in the presence of <b>dipole</b> <b>layers</b> of adsorbed H₂O and LiOH (formed in the reaction of H₂O and Li) agrees with the experimental observations. A calculation of the rate of diffusion of Li into Au shows that diffusion proceeds too rapidly to allow observation of effects due to adsorbed Li.
