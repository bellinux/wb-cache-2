5|$|Prior {{to turning}} onto Rutgers Street, CR-506 runs along Washington Street {{concurrent}} {{with the northern}} section of Route 7. Though the northern section of Route 7 begins a few blocks south, it is not readily recognized (minimal signing). As CR-506 runs concurrently with it here, and then turns down Rutgers for the short distance that bridges {{the gap between the}} two Route 7 sections, Rutgers/506 is often viewed as <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> Route 7, while the short portion of the northern section that lies south of Rutgers is sometimes seen as a spur, even though {{it is part of the}} main route.|$|E
5|$|During sessions, {{members may}} speak after being called {{on by the}} President. Members of the Council or Commission may also attend and speak in debates. Partly due {{to the need for}} translation, and the {{politics}} of consensus in the chamber, debates tend to be calmer and more polite than, say, the Westminster system. Voting is conducted primarily by a show of hands, that may be checked on request by electronic voting. Votes of MEPs are not recorded in either case, however; that only occurs when there is a roll-call ballot. This is required for the final votes on legislation and also whenever a political group or 30 MEPs request it. The number of roll-call votes has increased with time. Votes can also be a completely secret ballot (for example, when the president is elected). All recorded votes, along with minutes and legislation, are recorded in the Official Journal of the European Union and can be accessed online. Votes usually do not follow a debate, but rather they are grouped with other due votes on specific occasions, usually at noon on Tuesdays, Wednesdays or Thursdays. This is because the length of the vote is unpredictable and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> for longer than allocated it can disrupt other debates and meetings later in the day.|$|E
5|$|While Bauer {{performs}} {{missionary work}} at the Okavango school in Sangala owned by Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle), U.S. embassy official Frank Trammel (Gil Bellows) serves him a subpoena {{to appear before the}} Senate regarding torture charges, but Bauer refuses to go. Upon hearing the embassy will cut funding to Benton's school <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> to protect him, he decides to leave. Meanwhile, several children playing soccer are ambushed by Juma's rebel soldiers and kidnapped for conscription. When two boys run away, the soldiers open fire, killing one. Benton learns that the rebels are planning to attack his school. He calls Bauer, who hides the children in an underground shelter, and kills several rebels before getting captured and tortured. Benton is able to ambush the remaining soldiers, and Bauer kills the leader, Youssou Dubaku (Zolile Nokwe). His brother, Iké (Hakeem Kae-Kazim) hears of his death and plots revenge, while Bauer and Benton leave with the children to get to the American embassy in the capital before the final helicopter evacuates the country.|$|E

500|$|Harry Mason {{is driving}} through Silent Hill with his {{daughter}} Cheryl for a vacation. At the town's edge, he swerves his car to avoid hitting {{a girl in the}} road; as a result, he crashes the vehicle and loses consciousness. Waking up in town, he realizes that his daughter is missing, so he sets out to look for her. He meets police officer Cybil Bennett, who works in the nearby town of Brahms. Finding that the town is deserted and foggy, with snow falling out of season, Harry meets several other people in the monster-filled town: Dahlia Gillespie, who gives him a charm, the [...] "Flauros"; Doctor Michael Kaufmann, director of Silent Hill's Alchemilla Hospital; and nurse Lisa Garland, who worked at Alchemilla. He also encounters a symbol throughout the town, which Dahlia claims will allow darkness to take over the town <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> to multiply. Eventually, this darkness begins taking over the town. According to Dahlia, the girl from the road is a demon responsible for the symbol's duplication. She urges him to stop the demon, because if he does not, Cheryl will die. Harry soon finds himself attacked by Cybil, who is parasitized by a creature; the player must choose whether to save her or not.|$|E

In {{the face of this}} and his the boardroom's opposition, DCX refused to pledge further funds, and formally stated that it would no longer financially support its partner. Japan's finance minister, Nobuteru Ishihara, commented that the decision [...] "could affect the future of the company", while corporate analysts were more forthright, calling it [...] "a disaster" [...] and claiming that [...] " [...] will vanish <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> this way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Cleckely {{considers}} {{that the concept}} of [...] has much in common with his concept of psychopathy, and argues that it could be considered a mild version <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> {{for a long time and}} is generalized. He notes that many respectable mature productive citizens can look back on short periods of unprovoked social misconduct, including such things as property damage, racism, bestiality, voyeurism, rebellion, and promiscuity. On the other hand, he notes prolonged but prescribed behavioral disorder in the case of a woman who remained for some time [...] "irrationally promiscuous and bisexual", but who had plausible psychological reasons for her behavior and was otherwise functional in her work and life. He also notes he no longer {{considers that}} homosexuality should be classed as sexual psychopathy, on the grounds that many homosexuals seem to be able to live productive lives in society. He considers that sexual fetishes are not particularly consistent with psychopaths, as the latter tend to have weak drives. However, paradoxically, he then states that psychopathy can be associated with particular sadistic drives and often be responsible for the most serious sex crimes.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after declaring war on Serbia, Conrad {{informed}} the Germans that Austria-Hungary could not start operations until 12 August, to much fury in Berlin. Bavarian diplomat Count Lerchenfeld reported to Munich: [...] "The Imperial government is thus {{put into the}} extraordinary difficult position of being exposed during the intervening period to the other Powers’ proposals for mediation and conferences, and <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> to maintain its previous reserve towards such proposals, the odium of having provoked a world war will in the end recoil on it, even {{in the eyes of}} the German people. But a successful war on three fronts (viz, in Serbia, Russia and France) can not be initiated and carried on such a basis. It is imperative that the responsibility for any extension of the conflict to the Powers not directly concerned should under all circumstances fall on Russia alone." [...] At the same time, the German Ambassador to Russia, Portalés, reported that, based on a conversation with Sazonov, Russia was prepared to make [...] "astonishing" [...] concessions by promising to pressure Serbia to agree to most of the Austrian demands to avoid a war. The prospect of talks was rejected out of hand by Bethmann Hollweg.|$|E
2500|$|Kuwaiti writer Abdullah Saad Al-Hadlaq {{urged his}} country to {{normalize}} relations with Israel. Responding {{to a question}} whether he believed that Muslims {{have a right to}} rule Jerusalem, Hadlaq said, [...] "On the contrary, verse number 21 of Surat Al-Maeda of the Holy Quran emphasizes the right of 'Bani Israel'". He said that Israel's model of democracy is unique and surpassed many of what he described as the [...] "tyrannical, totalitarian" [...] Arab regimes. In his 2008 article, [...] "The Right of Self-defense," [...] Al-Hadlaq supported [...] "Israel's right to defend itself" [...] and told the international community [...] "not to criticize Israel <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> its fight against Persian terror committed by the terrorist Hamas (...) and not to criticize Israel for using force to defend its citizens and its territory". In 2011, Hadlaq warned against a unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state, which he says will shatter the idea of real peace in the region. According to Al-Hadlaq, Israel has in the past made strategic concessions for peace, in Sinai, the Gaza Strip and South Lebanon, proving her desire for peaceful negotiations, but the response she earned was a hail of rockets from the [...] "terrorists of Hizballah and Hamas".|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{increasing}} the worldwide food supply, {{early in his}} career Borlaug stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of population growth will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, [...] "Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the 'Population Monster'... <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>continues</b> to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?" [...] However, some observers have suggested that by the 1990s Borlaug had changed his position on population control. They point to a quote from the year 2000 in which he stated: [...] "I now say that the world has the technology—either available or well advanced in the research pipeline—to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called 'organic' methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot." [...] However, Borlaug remained on the advisory board of Population Media Center, an organization working to stabilize world population, until his death.|$|E
