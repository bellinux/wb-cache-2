50|$|The European-derived first {{settlers}} of {{the area}} arrived in 1739 by sea from Eastham, Massachusetts. They traveled up the Connecticut River to Middle Haddam parish between the two adjacent towns of Middletown and Haddam. Led by Isaac Smith, some of these settlers {{went on to the}} hills near Lake Pocotopaug, the present-day location of East Hampton. In 1746, the settlers named their community Easthampton parish after their former home of Eastham. In 1767, the community was separated from Middletown incorporated by the Connecticut General Assembly as the township of Chatham, after Chatham, Medway due to the important shipbuilding industries that both places had in common. An iron forge at the outlet of Lake Pocotopaug was one of the earliest in Connecticut. The forge supplied the local needs and the shipbuilding industry {{on the banks of the}} Connecticut River. Shipbuilding up the Connecticut River was given a boost during the War of 1812 when the British raided a town at the mouth of the Connecticut River. The knowledge gained in <b>forging</b> <b>and</b> <b>casting</b> iron was later used for creating other items including waffle irons. Bell making continued to grow during the 1800s with firms utilizing the water power of the Pocotopaug Stream. After the Civil War numerous coffin trimming concerns lined the stream. Some firms changed focus over time such as the Watrous Mfg. Co. which started making just bells, later making coffin trimmings, and still later making bell toys.|$|E

A series of experiments were carried out on normal and high speed milling of TA 15. The recommended tools for many years had been the uncoated tungsten carbide grade K. In this work, the tool life of coated carbide tools used in high speed milling of <b>forging</b> <b>and</b> <b>cast</b> {{titanium alloy}} was studied. Additionally, the wear mechanism of cutting tools was also discussed. Finally, surface integrity, including surface roughness, metallograph and work hardening, were examined and analyzed.

40|$|Abstract. Semi-solid {{processing}} of materials provides advantages of both <b>forging</b> <b>and</b> <b>casting.</b> Ex-periments with high-melting and biocompatible alloys aiming at a ‚Äúnear-net-shape ‚Äù production tech-nology recently have been conducted. Advanced trials showed, that {{processing of}} such materials {{by means of}} semi-solid forming deliver a huge potential for feasible workpiece shapes and drastically reduces machining time and subsequent surface treatment efforts. In contrast to semi-solid forming of aluminium alloys at relatively low temperature levels any proc-essing of high-melting point alloys in the semi-solid state is much more challenging due to higher forming temperature. Commonly used tool materials provoke high wear rates due to wetting, bond-ing and melting processes which finally result {{in a very short}} tool life time. Thus, more apt materials and composites for forming tools and dies which can withstand corrosion, wear, tear and extreme changes in temperatures have to be found. The development of new design concepts for long-living close-to-production tools based on such new materials will be a future goal...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{process of}} thixoforming {{incorporates}} {{a series of}} forming processes in the semi-solid state, which can be categorized between the conventional processes of <b>forging</b> <b>and</b> <b>casting</b> and combines the advantages of these processes. Thixoforming of steels in the semi-solid state, requires round, solid particles (globulites) in a liquid matrix which is deformed with low forming forces. In order to achieve laminar material flow and to produce segregation-free components, the material must fulfil diverse criteria. First, the melting interval should be as large as possible for an easy temperature regulation. Next, low solidus and liquidus temperatures are advantageous regarding tool loading. Additionally, thixoformable steels should show a melting behaviour that is finegrained and globular. Furthermore, these steels should possess low contents of intraglobular liquid phase fractions. This paper gives {{a survey of the}} current state of steel Thixoforming and deals with the development of adaptive heat treatment strategies. Regarding the structure formation and the development of suitable heat treatment strategies, the once semi-solid state yields new structures that can be applied in ways not previously possible with conventional hardening processes.

40|$|In {{the process}} Thixoforging (forging in the {{semi-solid}} state) {{the advantages of}} the processes <b>forging</b> <b>and</b> <b>casting</b> can be combined. For example, complex geometries, which are normally produced in 4 or 5 steps, can be realised in one or two steps. In contrast to the forming of aluminium alloys in the semi-solid state, the forming of steel in the semi-solid state is much more difficult, because of the higher forming temperature. Common tools out of steel show a very important wear due to wetting, bonding and melting processes, which result in a very short tool life. The aim of this work was the development of appropriate tools for the thixoforming of steel. To develop appropriate tool technologies the entire process chain had to be analysed and optimised. Principle studies, forming tests and FEM-simulations show that the ceramic Si 3 N 4 is very suitable as a material tool. The use of preheated tools of ceramic, the optimisation of the heating of billets with inert gas and particularly the development of the method of the aimed cooling before forming made possible the thixoforming of components with the same quality as forged ones. The process of thixoforming of steel offers very large potentials of cost savings, since the amount of machining work can be reduced and the process chain can be shortened for example by forming with an integrated joining process [KAL- 02] or surface hardening...|$|E
40|$|In {{aerospace}} industry {{and other major}} mechanical industry systems, engineering components that are subjected to cyclic loads often lead to progressive crack growth that eventually results in struc-tural fracture. The damage tolerance design {{which is based on}} the assumption of pre-existed flaws in a structure is an important approach in aircraft industry since it is impossible to have flaw-free manufactured components. In this thesis work, an evaluation of crack propagation models was carried out. Fatigue crack growth threshold and fatigue crack growth rate models were evaluated. A method to present ex-perimental data available was developed to evaluate uncertainties in fatigue life models for more accurate predictions. Currently, a software that is used for predicting crack propagation life is NASGRO. The study has been made for two types of materials: a nickel-iron-based alloy (Inconel 718 forging) and titanium alloys (Ti 6 - 4 both <b>forging</b> <b>and</b> <b>casting).</b> A threshold model is in the normal case developed for each temperature. A method to model fatigue threshold (ŒîKth) has been suggested by assuming temperature independence of ŒîKth. In this method, a new threshold model was created by making use of an A/P (Actual/Predicted) plot so that all measured threshold values are on the conservative side of the minimum model. With this method, an understanding of fatigue threshold model was improved over the other method due to the possibilities to model ŒîKth with average and minimum threshold values for each load ratio (ŒîKth, R). Moreover, a method to investigate which set of parameters that best represent the crack growth behaviour has been suggested. In this method the best set of parameters were chosen to be the set of parameters giving the best fit to the available (da/dN, ŒîK) points. The comparison between this method and the method with the set of parameters that give minimum scatter in the A/P values was done. Crack growth rate da/dN log curves were plotted as function of stress intensity range ŒîK for R-ratio values ranging from - 2 to 0. 9 for the two different methods. A distinctive difference between the two methods was observed in Paris region at high temperatures (5500 C- 6500 C) which becomes more obvious at lower R-ratios. Predicting crack propagation rate model with set of parameters giving minimum standard deviation in da/dN points was shown to be less conservative than that of parameter sets giving lowest scatter in A/P. Using both evaluation methods, da/dN versus ŒîK plots of Inconel 718 forging were compared to da/dN (ŒîK) plots for the pre-existing data at 5500 C for R-ratios ranging from 0 to 0. 8. An overall R-ratio influence was observed throughout for both ŒîKth and da/dN...|$|E
