500|$|Tweedy {{felt the}} new members {{gave him a}} new {{opportunity}} {{to contribute to the}} band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2004 Beckinsale {{starred in}} the action horror film Van Helsing. She was [...] "so surprised" [...] to be {{appearing}} in her second action film in two years. [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a very good role." [...] Beckinsale had just separated from her long-term boyfriend Michael Sheen {{at the time of}} filming and appreciated the warm atmosphere created on set by director Stephen Sommers and co‑star Hugh Jackman: [...] "I really did find that working with people like Stephen and Hugh made it possible to get through what I was going through." [...] The film grossed over $120 million at the U.S. box office and over $300 million worldwide, but it was not well-reviewed. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle described her as [...] "a pretty actress doing her best to maintain dignity, vainly trying to craft a feminist statement from a filmmaker's whimsy" [...] while Rex Reed of The New York Observer felt she was [...] "desperately in need of a new agent." ...|$|E

Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it felt right for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
500|$|Gary Anderson's missed kick {{has been}} singled out as the main {{contributing}} factor to the Vikings' loss, as the Falcons were able {{to capitalize on the}} late shift in momentum produced by an unexpected opportunity to tie and eventually win the game. Considering this impact on the game's outcome and the historic performances of Anderson and the 1998 Vikings team, the miss has since been noted as a memorable moment in the greater history of the NFL. Paul Allen, the play-by-play radio announcer for the Vikings, and Dan Barreiro both consider the miss {{as one of the most}} devastating moments in the history of Minnesota sports. According to Chad Hartman, another sports radio host based in Minneapolis, [...] " [...] will always be known as the guy who was a part of screwing up the Vikings' trip to the Super Bowl, even though he had this magnificent season." [...] ESPN voted the miss as the most memorable play in Vikings history, and ESPN contributor Ben Goessling believes that the miss influenced misfortunes that the franchise faced in subsequent years, including two further NFC Championship losses in 2000 and 2009. Cunningham concurred by claiming, [...] "With that kick, it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the whole franchise went wide left." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Goin' In" [...] {{was written}} by Michael Warren, Jamahl Listenbee, Joseph Angel, Coleridge Tillman, David Quiñones and Tramar Dillard. Lopez's vocals were {{produced}} by Harrell and recorded at Pinky's Palace. Josh Gudwin and O'Ryan handled audio engineering of the song, with assistance from Falcone and Mack. The song features additional vocals from American rapper Lil Jon. GoonRock produced and later mixed the song alongside Kenny Moran at The House on the Hill Studios in Los Angeles, California. Of GoonRock, Lopez commented by stating that he is [...] "very forward with his sound". After recording her vocals for the song, Flo Rida recorded a rap verse for the song. Those involved {{in the production of}} the song were extremely happy with the song before Flo Rida's rap appeared on it, but once his vocals were on the song it [...] "took it over the top top". When choosing who she wanted to feature on the song, Lopez had several other rappers in mind, such as Big Sean. Lopez revealed: [...] "We had a couple of people who said yes, that they would get on it, but [...] <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> the perfect one." [...] She further explained that the style of the song [...] "really fit Flo Rida"; [...] "It was half-dance, but half kind of hard too." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the latter}} half of 2005, Working Title {{approached}} several towns in South West England looking for an appropriate filming location. Pegg commented, [...] "We're both [...] from the West Country so it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> it was the perfect and logical thing to drag those kind of ideas and those genres and those clichés back to our beginnings to where we grew up, so you could see high-octane balls-to-the-wall action in Frome". Stow-on-the-Wold was considered amongst others, but after being turned away, the company settled upon Wells in Somerset, Wright's hometown, of which he has said [...] "I love it but I also want to trash it". Wells Cathedral was digitally painted out of every shot of the cathedral city, as Wright wanted the Church of St. Cuthbert to be the centre building for the fictional town of Sandford; however, the Bishop's Palace is identifiable in some shots (and was itself used as the setting for some scenes). While shooting scenes in their uniforms, Pegg and Frost were often mistaken for genuine police officers and asked for directions by passers-by. Filming also took place at the Hendon Police College, including the driving school skid pan and athletic track. Filming commenced on 19 March 2006 and lasted for eleven weeks. After editing, Wright ended up cutting half an hour of footage from the film.|$|E

2500|$|Einziger noted, [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seems</b> <b>like</b> a very {{appropriate}} {{name for the}} album because we've been {{in the spirit of}} taking risk, stepping up and making a leap. For us, it's a very common theme for us to take chances, to do things differently. There's something exciting and equally scary about that idea. Now we've nothing left to lose, really.

So I just played her like a mom going to work." [...] On the subject on the character's prosthetic breasts, Ullman revealed that production asked if she wanted a molding of her actual breasts. [...] "I thought, 'No, no, no!'" [...] Ullman praised the BBC for agreeing not to pixelate the character's nipples. [...] "t was very tough to wear those prosthetic breasts and talk to the crew. You either had the people who stared at your tits — or the ones who are determined to look you in your eyes. My director, bless him, never ever looked at me below neck on those shooting days." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Foo Fighters {{traveled}} to Grohl's {{home state of}} Virginia to write music for its third album. However, Grohl and Stahl were unable to co-operate as songwriters; Grohl told Kerrang! in 1999, [...] "in those few weeks it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> {{the three of us}} were moving in one direction and Franz wasn't". Grohl was distraught over the decision to fire Stahl, as the two had been friends since childhood. Shortly after that, Mendel called Grohl to say he was quitting the band to reunite with Sunny Day Real Estate, only to reverse his decision the next day. The remaining trio of Grohl, Mendel, and Hawkins spent the next several months recording the band's third album, There Is Nothing Left to Lose, in Grohl's Virginia home studio that he bought and built. The album spawned several singles, including [...] "Learn to Fly", the band's first single to reach the US Billboard Hot 100.

2500|$|Hodgson {{decided to}} leave the series halfway through Season Five due to his dislike of being on-camera and his {{disagreements}} with producer Mallon over creative control of the program. Hodgson also stated that Mallon's insistence to produce a feature film version of the show led to his departure, giving up his rights on the MST3K property to Mallon. Hodgson later told an interviewer: [...] "If I had {{the presence of mind to}} try and work it out, I would rather have stayed. 'Cause I didn't want to go, it <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> I needed to." [...] Though they held casting calls for a replacement for Hodgson on camera, the crew found that none of the potential actors really fit the role; instead, having reviewed a test run that Nelson had done with the 'bots, the crew agreed that having Nelson (who had already appeared in guest roles on the show) replace Hodgson would be the least jarring approach. [...] The replacement of Joel by Mike would lead to an oft-jokingly [...] "Joel vs Mike flame war" [...] among fans, similar to the [...] "Kirk vs Picard" [...] discussions in the Star Trek fandom.|$|E

[...] I have loads of material of stuff to do, but it's just about the timing and about getting it right and getting the right songs to put out." [...] She enlisted Barbara Charone, who was worked with Madonna and Christina Aguilera, as a publicist and Bruce Garfield as her manager. [...] "There wasn't anything wrong with what had happened or what had gone on for years - because it was really successful," [...] Nadine said. [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>like</b> I had taken a completely different route, personally, in the writing and the production and I wanted a completely new team so we could start afresh."

This was denied by manager Bruce Garfield. In April 2010, it was reported she had signed to Geffen Records. The deal later fell through.|$|E

However, Tylo believed that [...] "in reality that's what she needed – to be more human. But she just got boring instead". Taylor is gunned down by Sheila Carter (Kimberlin Brown) and appears to die in hospital a few days later due to her injuries.
