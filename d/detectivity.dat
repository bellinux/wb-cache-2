40|$|We present {{noise current}} {{measurements}} {{on a specific}} elms of quanturn well infrared photodetectors (QWIPs). The design of the detectors implies a carrier mean free path of exactly one period of the superlattices with N = 20 periods. This leads to a deterministic carrier capture process, resulting in the lack of recombination noise. The noise current {{in this type of}} detector is given by I(noise) =(root of 4 e/gn- 1 /(2 N)) I(dark) delta f) with the electron charge e, the noise gain gn, = 1 /(Npc) (where pc is the carrier capture probability), the dark current I(dark) and the measurement bandwidth delta f. For pc = 1 this expression reduces to the shot noise expression for N series-connected photo junctions. From the design of the structures we expect a noise gain of gn = 1 /N = 0. 05 at sufficiently small bias voltages, which is confirmed by the measurements in combination with the appropriate noise model.
