40|$|ABSTRACT: In situ {{accelerated}} {{anaerobic biodegradation}} (AAB) is being successfully employed to treat chlorinated solvents that were historically released into soil and groundwater beneath Building 719, a mission-critical maintenance facility at Dover Air Force Base (DAFB), Delaware. Contaminants {{are attributed to}} <b>engine</b> <b>cleaning</b> activities conducted in the building and include trichloroethene (TCE), 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (1, 1, 1 -TCA), and their degradation products. The AAB system was installed to remediate contaminated groundwater in the source area and minimize the continued contribution to the dissolved plume extending approximately one mile downgradient. The AAB system establishes hydraulic control in the source area by recirculating groundwater through injection and extraction wells located outside Building 719. A carbon substrate and metabolic nutrients {{are added to the}} recirculated groundwater as it is reinjected to enhance the natural microbial population at the site. This creates and maintains a reactive zone {{in the vicinity of the}} injection wells where contaminants are reductively dechlorinated via microbial metabolic processes. An estimated 130 pounds (59 kilograms [kg]) of TCE were degraded to ethene between May 2002 and October 2004. Additionally, during a period of elevated water table conditions (January 2003 to July 2003), an estimated 530 pounds (240 kg) of TCE were dissolved from the shallow soils and made available for biodegradation...|$|E

The engine combustion products are causing the greenhouse effect, acid rains, ozone layer depletion and some other pollution. On the other hand, many study research on fossil fuel in the previous years, observed that if the oil is consumed at this rates, 81 % of the entire available resource will be consumed very soon. So now we begin to get some alternative energy to replace fossil fuel. There is some alternative sources of energy, like battery, photocells, hydrogen fuel cell, bio-diesel or compressed air can be chose.

S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) FreedomCAR & Vehicle Technologies Program. Eight INEEL four-cycle diesel engine buses used to transport INEEL employees on various routes and six INEEL Chevrolet Tahoes with gasoline engines are equipped with oil bypass filter systems from the puraDYN Corporation. The bypass filters are reported to have engine oil filtering capability of < 1 micron and a built-in additive package to facilitate extended oil-drain intervals. This quarter, the eight diesel engine buses traveled 82, 123 miles. As {{of the end of}} September 2004, they had accumulated 580, 848 miles {{since the beginning of the}} test and 516, 401 miles without an oil change. This represents an avoidance of 43 oil changes, which equates to 1, 505 quarts (376 gallons) of new oil not consumed and, furthermore, 1, 505 quarts of waste oil not generated. Two buses had their oil changed this quarter due to the degraded quality of the engine oil, as determined by the low total base numbers. This quarter, the six Tahoe test vehicles traveled 40, 762 miles. As of the end of September 2004, the six Tahoes have accumulated 150, 205 total test miles.

We then develop efficient algorithms for answering ranking queries using indexing structures of gram-based inverted lists. We answer a ranking query by traversing the inverted lists, pruning and skipping irrelevant string ids, iteratively increasing the pruning and skipping power, and doing early termination.

40|$|The final {{disposal}} of waste in sanitary landfill generates environmental impacts {{in the form of}} gaseous emissions and effluents in the seepage water. In product specicic Life Cycle Assessments, these environmental impacts resulting from the disposal of the product under study frequently have a strong influence on the overall results. The Sanitary Landfill (SL), like the Municipal Solid Waste Incineration (MSWI), is a complex system with a large variety of different types of waste with varying input composition. A direct determination of the environmental impacts resulting from the landfilling of a single input component, e. g. by measurements, is not possible. The model approach described in this paper shows an operationalized concept for the allocation of the environmental effects caused by the landfill process to special input components. The calculation of the landfill emissions in the model is based on the emission spectrum (landfill gas and seepage water) of an average-sized landfi ll in Germany and the elementary composition of the single waste fraction under consideration. The resulting reactor landfill module comprises an average split for diffuse and captured landfill emissions, the use of captured landfill gases in a gas <b>engine</b> and a <b>cleaning</b> of captured seepage water in a waste water treatment plant.

40|$|Despite {{spending}} {{much of their}} operating life in clear air, aircraft gas turbine engines are naturally prone to deterioration as they are generally not fitted with air filters. Engines are particularly at risk during takeoff and landing, and whilst operating in areas of pollution, sand, dust storms, etc. The build-up of contaminants, especially on the compressor surfaces, leads to a dramatic reduction in compressor efficiency, which {{gives rise to a}} loss of available power, increased fuel consumption and increased exhaust gas temperature. These conditions can lead to flight delays, inspection failures, withdrawal from service, increased operating costs and safety compromises. With the growing interest in life cycle costs for gas turbine engines, both engine manufacturers and operators are investigating the tradeoffs between performance improvements and associated maintenance costs. This report introduces the problem of output and efficiency degradation in two aero gas turbine engines (the T 56 –A– 15 and the F 110 –GE– 129) caused by various deterioration factors. Their causes are broadly discussed and the effects on powerplant performance are simulated and analyzed. One of the key factors leading to performance losses during operation of these engines is compressor fouling. The fouling can come {{from a wide variety of}} sources; hydrocarbons from fuel and lubricating oils; volcanic ash; pollen; marine aerosols; dust; smoke; pollution, etc. The presence of these fouling sources acts as a bonding agent for the solid contaminants, ‘gluing’ them to the compressor surfaces. Thus, the aggravation in terms of power output, fuel consumption and additional time to carry out a typical mission will be assessed and an economic analysis will be attempted in order to quantify the effects of compressor fouling on the additional costs which arise, because of this specific deterioration. The effect of compressor fouling can be maintained by frequent cleaning to improve efficiency, resulting, hence, in improved power output, fuel savings and prolonged <b>engine</b> life. Compressor <b>cleaning</b> is thoroughly presented, and the implementation of on-wing off-line cleaning on the performance of the F 110 engine was investigated from a technical and economical standpoint. Finally, according to the results obtained, the optimal frequency of compressor washing for the F 110 engine is estimated, in order to eliminate safety compromises, improve performance and reduce the engine’s life cycle cost...|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of moving object data, originating in supply chain operations, road network monitoring, and other RFID applications, {{is a major}} challenge facing society today, with important implications into business optimization, city planning, privacy, and national security. Towards the solution of this problem, I have developed a comprehensive framework for warehousing, mining, and cleaning large moving object data sets. The proposed framework addresses the following key challenges present in object tracking applications: (1) Datasets are massive, a single large retailer may generate terabytes of moving object data per day. (2) Data is usually dirty, many tags are not detected at all, or are incorrectly detected at the wrong location. (3) Dimensionality is very large, there are spatio-temporal dimensions defined by object trajectories, sensor related dimensions such as temperature or humidity recorded at different locations, and item level dimensions describing the attributes of each object. (4) Data analysis and mining need to navigate and discover interesting patterns, {{at different levels of}} abstraction, and involving a large number of interrelated records in multiple datasets. At the core of my dissertation, is the RFID data warehousing engine. It receives clean data from the <b>cleaning</b> <b>engine,</b> and provides highly compressed data, at multiple levels of abstraction, to the mining engine. The mining engine is composed of three modules. The first, mines commodity flow patterns that identify general flow trends and significant flow exceptions in a large supply chain operation. The second, makes route recommendations, based on observed driving behavior and traffic conditions. And the third, discovers and characterizes a wide variety of traffic anomalies on a road network. RFID Data Warehousing. A data warehouse is an enterprise level data repository that collects and integrates organizational data in order to provide decision support analysis. At the core of the data warehouse is the data cube, which computes an aggregate measure (e. g., sum, avg, count) for all possible combination of dimensions of a fact table (e. g., sales for 2004, in the northeast). Online analytical processing (OLAP) operations provide the means for exploration and analysis of the data cube. My research on this direction has extended the data cube to handle moving object data sets, by significantly compressing such data, and proposing a new aggregation mechanism that preserves its path structure. The RFID warehouse is built around the concept of the movement graph, which records both spatio-temporal and item level information in a compact model. We show that compression and query processing efficiency can be significantly improved, by partitioning the movement graph around gateway nodes, which are special locations connecting different spatial regions in the graph. RFID Data Cleaning. Efficient and accurate data cleaning is an essential task for the successful deployment of applications, such as object tracking and inventory management systems, based on RFID technology. Most existing data cleaning approaches do not consider the overall cost of cleaning in an environment that possibly includes thousands of readers and millions of tags. We propose a cleaning framework that takes an RFID data set and a collection of cleaning methods, with associated costs, and induces a cleaning plan that optimizes the overall accuracy-adjusted cleaning costs. The cleaning plan determines the conditions under which inexpensive cleaning methods can be safely applied, the conditions under which more expensive methods are absolutely necessary, and those cases when a combination of several methods is the optimal policy. Through a variety of experiments we show that our framework can achieve better accuracy {{at a fraction of the}} cost than that obtained by applying any single technique. Mining Flow Trends. An important application of moving objects is mining movement patterns of objects in supply chain operations. In this context, one may ask questions regarding correlations between time spent at quality control locations and laptop return rates, salient characteristics of dairy products discarded from stores, or ships that spent abnormally long at intermediate ports before arrival. The gigantic size of such data, and the diversity of queries over flow patterns pose great challenges to traditional workflow induction and analysis technologies since processing may involve retrieval and reasoning over a large number of inter-related tuples through different stages of object movements. Creating a complete workflow that records all possible commodity movements and that incorporates time will be prohibitively expensive since there can be billions of different location and time combinations. I propose the FlowGraph, as a compressed probabilistic workflow, that captures the general flow trends and significant exceptions of a data set. The FlowGraph achieves compression by recording the set of major flow trends, and the set of non-redundant flow exceptions (i. e., abnormal transitions or durations) present in the data. I extended the concept of the FlowGraph to incorporate multiple levels of abstraction of object and path characteristics, and defined the FlowCube, which is a data cube that records FlowGraphs as measures, and that allows OLAP reasoning on object flows. Mining Route Recommendations. Modern highway networks provide several mechanisms for automatic vehicle identification. The most common are the use of toll collection transponders to detect vehicles at multiple points in the network, and the use of cameras to automatically identify license plates. Such information provides valuable patterns useful to online navigation systems and route planning applications. Most existing route planning applications use a fastest path algorithm based on static or dynamic models of road speeds, but such models in general disregard observed driver behavior, and other important factors such as weather, car-pool availability, or vehicle type. Existing solutions may, for example, provide a route that is the fastest one, but that goes through a high crime area, and is thus avoided by experienced drivers. We propose a traffic-mining-based path-finding method that mines speed and driving models from historic traffic data, and uses them to compute fast routes that are well supported by historic driving behavior under the set of relevant driving and traffic conditions. Mining Traffic Anomalies. Identification and characterization of traffic anomalies on massive road networks is a vital component of traffic monitoring. Anomaly identification can be used to reduce congestion, increase safety, and provide transportation engineers with better information for traffic forecasting and road network design. However, due to the size, complexity and dynamics of such transportation networks, it is challenging to automate the process. We propose a multi-dimensional mining framework that can be used to identify a concise set of anomalies from massive traffic monitoring data, and further overlay, contrast, and explore such anomalies in multi-dimensional space...|$|R
