5|$|Autocannons have an {{automatic}} firing mode, {{similar to that}} of a machine gun. They have mechanisms to automatically load their ammunition, and therefore have a higher rate of fire than artillery, often approaching, or, in the case of rotary autocannons, even surpassing the <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> of a machine gun. While there is no minimum bore for autocannons, they are generally larger than machine guns, typically 20mm or greater since World War II and are usually capable of using explosive ammunition even if it isn't always used. Machine guns in contrast are usually too small to use explosive ammunition.|$|E
5|$|Most Shogunate troops used Büchse (Gewehr) smoothbore guns, {{which had}} been {{imported}} in Japan since around 1840, initially from the Netherlands by Takashima Akiho. These guns were rather ancient and had limited capabilities, with an effective lethal range of about 50 meters, and a <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> of about 2 rounds per minute. The daimyō of Nagaoka however, an ally of the Shogun, possessed two Gatling guns and several thousand modern rifles. The Shogunate {{is known to have}} placed an order for 30,000 modern Dreyse needle guns in 1866. Napoleon III provided Tokugawa Yoshinobu with 2,000 state-of-the-art Chassepot rifles, which he used to equip his personal guard. Antiquated Tanegashima matchlock guns are also known to have been used by the Bakufu however.|$|E
25|$|A neuron affects other neurons by {{releasing}} a neurotransmitter that binds to chemical receptors. The effect upon the postsynaptic neuron is determined {{not by the}} presynaptic neuron or by the neurotransmitter, but {{by the type of}} receptor that is activated. A neurotransmitter {{can be thought of as}} a key, and a receptor as a lock: the same type of key can here be used to open many different types of locks. Receptors can be classified broadly as excitatory (causing an increase in <b>firing</b> <b>rate),</b> inhibitory (causing a decrease in <b>firing</b> <b>rate),</b> or modulatory (causing long-lasting effects not directly related to <b>firing</b> <b>rate).</b>|$|E

25|$|Both {{amphetamine}} and methylphenidate {{are predominantly}} dopaminergic drugs, yet their mechanisms of action are distinct. Methylphenidate {{acts as a}} norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor while amphetamine is both a releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor of dopamine and norepinephrine. Methylphenidate's mechanism of action in the release of dopamine and norepinephrine is fundamentally different from most other phenethylamine derivatives, as methylphenidate is thought to increase neuronal <b>firing</b> <b>rate,</b> whereas amphetamine reduces <b>firing</b> <b>rate,</b> but causes monoamine release by reversing {{the flow of the}} monoamines through monoamine transporters via a diverse set of mechanisms, including TAAR1 activation and modulation of VMAT2 function, among other mechanisms. The difference in mechanism of action between methylphenidate and amphetamine results in methylphenidate inhibiting amphetamine's effects on monoamine transporters when they are co-administered.|$|E
25|$|During each {{of these}} three periods, EEG data were {{collected}} for information on the rats' sleep stages. The mean firing rates of hippocampal place cells during prebehavior SWS (PRE) and three ten-minute intervals in postbehavior SWS (POST) were calculated by averaging across 22 track-running sessions from seven rats. The results showed that ten minutes after the trial RUN session, there was a 12% increase in the mean <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> of hippocampal place cells from the PRE level. After 20 minutes, the mean <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> returned rapidly toward the PRE level. The elevated firing of hippocampal place cells during SWS after spatial exploration could explain why there were elevated levels of slow-wave sleep in Datta's study, as it also dealt with a form of spatial exploration.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Spontaneous firing {{activity}} in dissociated rat cortical tissue cultured in vitro shows highly stable <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> over periods of hours. Recently, {{it was shown}} that {{a short period of}} low-frequency electrical stimulation induces signifi-cant and lasting changes in these <b>firing</b> <b>rates.</b> Now, it is shown that these changes also occur {{in the presence of the}} synaptic plasticity blocker KN 93 in the culture medium.

40|$|Modulation {{of motor}} unit <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> can change muscle force production. Motor unit <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> are often reduced during {{voluntary}} contractions of muscles influenced by {{disorders such as}} stroke or multiple sclerosis, while higher <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> are topical of muscles innervated by a reduced number of motoneurones. An expanded range of motor unit <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> is characteristic of disorders in which damage to various systems and neurons occur. Most neuromuscular disorders result {{in an increase in}} motor unit discharge variability, in part due to a higher incidence of doublets. In spinal cord injured subjects, long lasting involuntary contractions are common. This activity may reflect persistent inward currents that are revealed {{due to a lack of}} (voluntary) inhibition. Some of these changes in motor unit behaviour may actually work to enhance muscle force rather than to reduce it...|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{conditions}} under which spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) normalizes post-synaptic <b>firing</b> <b>rates.</b> Our simulations show that the rate normalization property of STDP is fragile and small changes in the LTD/LTP ratio or pre-synaptic input rates can lead to high <b>firing</b> <b>rates.</b> We propose an adaptive scheme to dynamically control the LTP/LTD ratio. The biophysics of synapses lead us to suggest a control mechanism using action potential-induced calcium influx, a known mediator of synaptic plasticity.

25|$|Increases in vagal {{activities}} to the SA node decreases the <b>firing</b> <b>rate</b> of the pacemaker cells by decreasing {{the slope of}} the pacemaker potential (phase 4 of the action potential); this decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy). The change in phase 4 slope results from alterations in potassium and calcium currents, as well as the slow-inward sodium current that is thought to be responsible for the pacemaker current (If). By hyperpolarizing the cells, vagal activation increases the cell's threshold for firing, which contributes to the reduction in the <b>firing</b> <b>rate.</b> Similar electrophysiological effects also occur at the AV node; however, in this tissue, these changes are manifested as a reduction in impulse conduction velocity through the AV node (negative dromotropy). In the resting state, there is a large degree of vagal tone on the heart, which is responsible for low resting heart rates.|$|E

50|$|The {{materials}} used in firestops do not have ratings on their own. Firestops achieve a <b>fire</b> <b>rating</b> by combining certain materials in an arrangement specific to the item (a pipe or cable for example) penetrating the <b>fire</b> <b>rated</b> wall or floor, and the construction arrangement of the <b>fire</b> <b>rated</b> wall or floor itself. For instance, a two-hour rated pipe penetration firestop may consist of a layer of caulking over packed rockwool. This overall arrangement provides the two-hour rating, not the caulking. However, both the individual firestop materials and the overall firestop assembly are 'listed' per listing and approval use and compliance.|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} study the initial rise of the mutual {{information}} between the <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> of N neurons {{and a set of}} p discrete stimuli has been analytically evaluated, under the assumption that neurons fire independently of one another to each stimulus and that each conditional distribution of <b>firing</b> <b>rates</b> is gaussian. Yet real stimuli or behavioural correlates are high-dimensional, with both discrete and continuously varying features. Moreover, the gaussian approximation implies negative <b>firing</b> <b>rates,</b> which is biologically implausible. Here, we generalize the analysis to the case where the stimulus or behavioural correlate has both a discrete and a continuous dimension. In the case of large noise we evaluate the mutual information up to the quadratic approximation as a function of population size. Then we consider a more realistic distribution of <b>firing</b> <b>rates,</b> truncated at zero, and we prove that the resulting correction, with respect to the gaussian <b>firing</b> <b>rates,</b> can be expressed simply as a renormalization of the noise parameter. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of averaging the distribution across the discrete dimension, evaluating the mutual information only with respect to the continuously varying correlate.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of the discharge frequency in neuronal communication, {{little is known about the}} firing-rate patterns of cortical populations.

The fraction of neurons that participated in population oscillations displayed a lognormal pattern.
