When Whitney starts a relationship with a man named Lee (Mitchell Hunt), it is revealed that he is a friend of Rob's, and when Whitney agrees to meet Lee by text, Rob takes control of Lee's mobile phone. She allows Rob to take her home but then tells him to wait outside while she escapes through the back door and hitches a lift to Southend-on-Sea with friends. She leaves him a voicemail message not knowing that he has followed her. He finds her in her hotel room and tells <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he loves her, but when Fatboy (Ricky Norwood) comes in, Rob attacks him, so Whitney tells him to leave.

500|$|Mercedes lied {{that she}} has {{contracted}} HIV from Malachy who ends his relationship with Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan) to reunite with Mercedes. When Malachy discovered her lies, he hit Mercedes, who felt, according to Metcalfe, that she [...] "deserved it" [...] because she was [...] "awful" [...] and [...] "the lies she told were just disgusting. She doesn't resent Malachy for hitting her at all". Mercedes reconciled with Malachy; Metcalfe explained that Mercedes still loved Malachy {{but was unable to}} stay away from other men. She added that seeing Malachy with Lynsey helped Mercedes [...] "realise" [...] how much she loved him. After Malachy is injured in an explosion, Metcalfe explained that Mercedes regretted her affair with Calvin and she [...] "desperately" [...] wanted the chance to [...] "make things work" [...] with Malachy. She added that if he died, Mercedes would find it difficult to live with her guilt. If Malachy were to die Mercedes would be [...] "devastated" [...] as he was [...] "the only positive thing in her life. [...] She thinks that she's nothing without him". Malachy died. Metcalfe felt that when Malachy shielded Mercedes from the explosion by throwing himself over her it [...] "proves to <b>her</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> he loves her. She knows that's special and regrets she ever took him and his love granted". Metcalfe felt that she and Wallace [...] "had amazing storylines", opining that Malachy's death was the most emotional scene she had filmed while with the serial.|$|E

60|$|That {{explained}} how Lenore {{came to be}} alone, high up' on the vast wheat-slope, watching and feeling, with no more work to do.
