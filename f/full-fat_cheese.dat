The effect of the plantessentialoils at concentrations of 0 · 1, 0 · 5 and 1 % was studied in low-fat and full-fat softcheese against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enteritidis at 4 ° and 10 °C respectively, over a 14 -day period. The composition of the cheese was shown {{to be an important}} factor in determining the effectiveness of the plantessentialoils. In the low-fat cheese, all four oils at 1 % reduced L. monocytogenes to ≤ 1 · 0 log 10 cfu ml− 1. In contrast, in the <b>full-fat</b> <b>cheese,</b> oil of clove was the only oil to achieve this reduction.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the composition of commercial full-fat and low-fat cheeses and to evaluate their microstructure. Commercial cheeses evaluated included full-fat and low-fat Cheddar, Mozzarella, processed, and Swiss cheeses. Cheddar cheeses ranged from 8. 2 % fat and 5 1. 1 % moisture in the 75 % low-fat product to 33. 2 % fat and 35. 9 % moisture in the <b>full-fat</b> <b>cheese.</b> Mozzarella cheeses ranged in fat from a low of 2.

Fatfree processed cheese had 0. 9 % fat and 58. 7 % moisture, while the full - fat cheese had 32. 3 % fat and 37. 4 % moisture. Full -fat Swiss cheese had fat and moisture content of 34. 8 and 36. 7 %, respectively. The corresponding values for the low-fat cheese were 27. 6 and 40. 1 %. Total protein con ten t of all cheeses increased with decreasing fat, but. the percent increase in protein was less than the percent reduction in fat. The ash content of Cheddar and Swiss also increased with a decrease in fat content. The fat con tent of cheeses affected the microstructure. Full -fat cheeses for all varieties were characterized by a protein matrix interspersed with fat globules of varying shape and size.

40|$|International audienceThere is an {{increasing}} focus {{on the development of}} cheese with reduced-fat and salt contents, owing to greater consumer focus on the profiling and intake management of nutrients. The current study evaluated the effects of reducing fat and salt, each by 30 and 50 %, on the composition, microbiological and biochemical characteristics of Cheddar-style cheese over a 270 -day ripening period. Reducing salt from 1. 9 to 1. 2 or 0. 9 % (w/w) significantly increased (P[*]<[*] 0. 05) moisture, lactic acid, lactic acid-to-protein ratio and water activity and reduced the mean level of residual lactose and starter culture die-off during ripening. Reducing fat from 33 to 22 or 16 % (w/w) resulted in significant increases in moisture, protein and lactic acid and reductions in salt-in-moisture, moisture-in-non-fat substances and lactic acid-to-protein ratio. Lactose content, pH and water activity were significantly affected by the interaction of fat and salt. The pH changed during the course of ripening, decreasing in <b>full-fat</b> full-salt <b>cheese,</b> increasing in half-fat reduced-salt and half-fat half-salt cheeses and remaining constant in other cheeses with different fat and salt levels. After 270  days of maturation at 8  °C, the <b>full-fat</b> full-salt <b>cheese</b> had lower concentrations of lactic acid and free amino acids and pH and a higher lactic acid-to-protein ratio than the reduced-fat reduced-salt or half-fat half-salt cheeses.

40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} fat {{reduction}} {{and the addition}} of octenyl succinylated (OS) waxy maize starch as a fat replacer on the physicochemical properties, texture, and microstructure of Minas fresh cheese was studied. The cheeses were produced according to three formulations: <b>full-fat</b> <b>cheese</b> (FC), reduced-fat cheese (RC), and reduced-fat cheese with 0. 5  kg/ 100  L of added starch (SC). Analyses of the chemical composition, titratable acidity, water-holding capacity (WHC), yield, texture, microstructure, and electrophoretic profile of casein were conducted. Fat reduction increased the hardness and decreased the yield of the cheeses. Fat reduction also promoted a denser microstructure and less proteolysis. The concentration of starch that was added was insufficient to improve the yield and texture parameters of the reduced-fat cheese. However, the addition of starch increased the moisture content and the WHC of the reduced-fat cheese. In general, OS waxy maize starch improved the overall quality of the reduced-fat Minas fresh cheese...|$|E

The physicochemical properties of the guar gum modified cheeses were {{similar to those of the}} low-fat control. No significant differences were detected in the thermal properties (concerning the enthalpy and profile of water desorption) among all types of cheeses. The rheological behaviour of the 0. 0025 % modified cheese was very similar to the full-fat control. Overall, no trend was observed in the texture profile (hardness, cohesiveness, gumminess and elasticity) of the modified cheeses versus guar gum concentration, as well as in comparison with the control groups, suggesting that none of the studied polysaccharide concentrations simulated the textural func-tions of fat in Edam cheese...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to survey the fatty acid profiles of fat spreads, margarines, shortenings, vegetable fat ice creams, vegetable fat milk-based cream substitutes, vegetable fat cheese substitutes, and reduced-fat cheeses on the Finnish market. The evaluation of the nutritional quality of fat in these products is of significance to dieticians and to the development of fat products with enhanced nutritional value. Remarkable differences between fatty acid profiles of vegetable fat products were found. Vegetable fat ice creams may have a lot of saturated fat and, in addition, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids may be very low. Vegetable fat half creams had, in general, less saturated fat and more polyunsaturated fatty acids than cream. The spreads and shortenings studied contained less than 2 % trans fatty acids of total fatty acids.

Taking into consideration the fact that the last investigation of Krčki cheese was done {{in the middle of the}} last century, probably some changes in technology of Krčki cheese production have occurred since this time. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were investigate the quality of sheep′s milk for Krčki cheese production, the quality of whey (as the material for production of albumin cheese quargs) and Krčki cheese, as well as the technology of Krčki cheese production on family farms on the island of Krk. Results of the composition and characteristics analyses of sheep′s milk for Krčki cheese production were as follows: milk fat 7. 81 %; proteins 5. 59 %; lactose 4. 97 %; total solids 19. 04 %; non-fat dry matter 11. 06 %; pH 6. 66; titratable acidity 9. 41 °SH, and freezing point – 0. 555 °C. Somatic cell count (SCC) was 407 000 cells/ml and total bacterial count (cfu) was 950 000 /mL. Average composition of Krčki cheese was as follows: fat 37. 38 %; protein 23. 24 %; total solids 63. 22 %; moisture in solid non-fat 57. 36 %; fat in total solids 54. 38 %; salt 1. 97 %; pH 5. 78; lactic acid content 1. 216 %; WSN/TN 10. 15 %, and TCASN/TN 6. 28 %. Microbiological analyses of Krčki cheese showed that only 55 % of analysed samples were hygienically acceptable according to the Regulations of Microbial Standards for Foods (NN 46 / 94.). Therefore, the necessary modifications have to be introduced into technology of production of sheep′s milk and Krčki cheese in order to increase microbiological quality and to reduce variability in composition and quality of Krčki cheese between family farms.

The purpose of this review is to examine recent literature on the relationship between dairy consumption and risk of cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality. Eighteen observational studies were reviewed, the results of which indicate that total dairy intake does not contribute to cardiovascular disease incidence or death. Based on available data, it appears that milk, cheese, and yogurt are inversely associated with cardiovascular disease risk. Data pertaining to dairy fat were inconclusive, but point to a potential protective effect of <b>full-fat</b> milk, <b>cheese,</b> and yogurt on risk of cardio-vascular disease. Currently, there is a need to study specific well-defined foods, as opposed to calculating nutrients, in order to better understand these relationships.

METHODS: Frequency questionnaires about 80 foods were answered by representative samples of 256 adolescents aged 12 to 19 from Rio de Janeiro {{as part of the}} Nutrition and Health Research project. The dependent variable was the serum cholesterol predicting equation as influenced by diet, and the independent variables were the foods. The variables were normalized and, using Pearson's correlation coefficient, those with r> 0. 10 were selected for the regression model. The model was analyzed for sex, age, random sample, and total calories. Those food products that explained 85 % of the cholesterol variation equation were present in the caloric model, and contained trans fatty acids were selected for the questionnaire.

40|$|As {{overweight}} and obesity numbers continue to climb around the world, consumers continue {{to search for}} reduced-fat alternatives to foods they often consume. Given that cheese is naturally high in fat, this is one food that is often targeted for fat reduction.

My study aimed at producing a reduced-fat cheese with improved texture compared to other reduced-fat cheese products by incorporating a double emulsion into the cheese in place of cream. The double emulsion consisted of small water droplets dispersed within oil droplets, which in turn were dispersed within a secondary water phase. The oil droplets that would then be incorporated into the cheese could essentially be made up of 40 % water droplets and only 60 % fat, allowing for a cheese to be designed with the same number of fat droplets as <b>full-fat</b> <b>cheese</b> while having a 40 % fat reduction.

The effects of fat substitution and cream homogenization on rheological and sensory properties of cheese were investigated after 1, 7, 14 and 28 days of storage at 4 C. Data showed that meltability and stretchability increased on 14 th day, then reduced while hardness decreased on 28 th day of storage.

40|$|Background/Objectives: Dairy foods contain various {{nutrients}} {{that may affect}} health. We investigated whether intake of dairy products or related nutrients is associated with mortality due to cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and all causes. Subjects/Methods: We carried out a 16 -year prospective study among a community-based sample of 1529 adult Australians aged 25 - 78 years at baseline. Habitual intakes of dairy products (total, high/low-fat dairy, milk, yoghurt and <b>full-fat</b> <b>cheese),</b> calcium and vitamin D were estimated as mean reported intake using validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) self-administered in 1992, 1994 and 1996. National Death Index data were used to ascertain mortality and cause of death between 1992 and 2007. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using Cox regression analysis. Results: During an average follow-up time of 14. 4 years, 177 participants died, including 61 deaths due to CVD and 58 deaths due to cancer. There was no consistent and significant association between total dairy intake and total or cause-specific mortality. However, compared with those with the lowest intake of full-fat dairy, participants with the highest intake (median intake 339 g/day) had reduced death due to CVD (HR: 0. 31; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 12 - 0. 79; P for trend = 0. 04) after adjustment for calcium intake and other confounders. Intakes of low-fat dairy, specific dairy foods, calcium and vitamin D showed no consistent associations. Conclusions: Overall intake of dairy products {{was not associated with}} mortality. A possible beneficial association between intake of full-fat dairy and cardiovascular mortality needs further assessment and confirmation.

40|$|International audienceOwing to {{the risks}} {{associated}} with excessive dietary intake of fat and sodium, there is an increased consumer demand for food products, including cheese, with reduced fat and salt content. Research to date has focused mainly on the separate effects of reducing fat and salt. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the combined effects of reducing fat from ~ 22 % to 11 % and salt from ~ 1. 7 % to 1. 0 %, on the composition, rheology and melting properties of mozzarella cheese. A secondary objective was to investigate the effect of reducing the calcium content of the reduced-fat, reduced-salt cheese as a means of improving its properties. Reducing fat and salt content led to higher levels of protein and moisture, lower contents of moisture-in-non-fat substances, fat-in-dry matter and salt-in-moisture. These changes coincided with lower water binding capacity, lower primary proteolysis and increased hardness and chewiness in the unheated cheese, and with a lower flow and higher work to extend (EW) the heated cheese. Lowering the calcium content of the reduced-fat reduced-salt cheese increased the levels of moisture and moisture-in-non-fat-substances, and reduced the protein content and the calcium-to-casein ratio; simultaneously, the unheated cheese had a higher water binding capacity, a reduced hardness and chewiness, while the heated cheese had higher flowability and a lower EW compared to the reduced-fat, reduced-salt cheese.

Four Cheddar-style cheeses were made in triplicate: full-fat control (FFC), half-fat control (HFC), full fat + GT (FFGum) and half fat + GT (HFGum). Cheesemilk for the latter two cheeses was supplemented with GT at a level of 0. 05 % (w/v); all cheeses were ripened at 8  °C for 10  months. Moisture and moisture-to-protein ratio were increased by GT addition. GT addition resulted in decreased pH in both FFGum and HFGum cheeses during ripening, especially the FFGum cheese. GT appeared to affect proteolysis only in the FF cheeses. GT was successful in decreasing hardness and springiness values during ripening. GT increased meltability in the FFGum cheese {{and to a lesser extent}} in the HFGum cheese in late ripening. An increase in opaqueness was also observed due to GT addition regardless of fat level. Dynamic small amplitude oscillatory rheology showed a depression in LTmax and an increase in G′ at 75  °C caused by GT at 7  months of ripening. GT did not appear to have any impact on starter bacteria and NSLAB counts. Results from a consumer ranking preference test showed that the GT was not successful in fully mimicking the sensory properties of the FFC cheese. These results suggest that GT appears more suited to enhancing the textural and functional properties of half-fat Cheddar cheese than its sensory properties...|$|R
40|$|Fontina Protected Denomination of Origin (PDO) <b>cheese</b> is a <b>full-fat</b> semi-cooked <b>cheese</b> {{traditionally}} made in Northwest Italy (Aosta Valley) {{and manufactured}} from raw cow's milk. The management of cattle farms in Aosta Valley calls for seasonal migration to high pastures {{during the summer}} and the concentration of calving during the autumn {{and the beginning of the}} winter. Based on cattle physiology and given to calving seasonality, three cow lactation phases i. e. post-partum, oestrus and early gestation, can be identified and an effect could be hypothesized on average milk composition and on cheese quality. The aim of the present paper was to investigate the bacterial dynamics during Fontina PDO cheese manufacturing and ripening, in relation to the different lactation stages, in order to evaluate a possible correlation between microbiota and phase of lactation. For this purpose, microbial RNA analysis was carried out by RT-PCR coupled with DGGE and high-throughput sequencing. A good performance of the starter cultures was highlighted throughout Fontina PDO manufacturing and ripening; in fact, the starter prevailed against the autochthonous microbiota. Thus, the microbial activity, which was supposed to affect the final quality of Fontina PDO cheese, appeared to be strictly associated to the presence of the starter, which did not show any difference in its performance according to the different stages of cow lactation. Therefore, the results of this research highlighted a negligible correlation between the microbiota of raw milk and the organoleptic quality and typicity of Fontina cheese in relation to lactation seasonality...|$|R
40|$|Developing low-fat {{cheese with}} flavor to match that of <b>full-fat</b> <b>cheese</b> {{has been a}} {{challenge}} in the dairy industry. The objective {{of this investigation was}} to develop lower fat Cheddar and Parmesan grated cheese using supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and characterize its flavor profile comparative to a full-fat product. Specifically, enabling flavor compound partition between the matrices of cheese and extracted lipids. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) was the supercritical fluid for fat extraction. Extraction took place in a 500 mL SFE vessel using 100 g of grated cheese. Fractional factorial design was utilized to investigate two levels of treatment for each pressure (200 and 350 bar), temperature (35 and 40 °C) and CO 2 level (500 and 1000 g) for each extraction trial. The most efficient parameters for lipid removal resulted in 51. 00 % fat reduction (wet basis) for Cheddar extracted at 200 bar, 40 °C, 1000 g CO 2, and 55. 56 % fat reduction for Parmesan extracted at 350 bar, 35 °C, 1000 g CO 2. Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was utilized to assess the lipid composition of each cheese and the lipids extracted by SFE. TLC analysis for Cheddar and Parmesan cheeses showed only nonpolar lipids (triaclyglycerides and free fatty acids) in the recovered lipids extracted by SFE; indicating that polar lipids such as phospholipids are being retained in the cheese matrix. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy techniques were used to characterize volatile flavor compounds for each cheese sample. SFE treatment of the cheeses altered the ability to detect flavor compounds and allowed partitioning of those compounds, which varied with the type of cheese. This study suggests that SFE technology can be used in the dairy industry to develop cheese products lower in fat, which retain flavor compounds that may not be typically fully developed with alternative methods of low-fat cheese processing...|$|E
40|$|Chronically hemodialyzed (HD) {{patients}} frequently {{suffer from}} quantitative {{and even more}} often qualitative serum lipids disorders. Mostly they have increased triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol, slightly increased or normal total and LDL-cholesterol and decreased HDL-cholesterol concentrations. The study compared lipid profile between two groups of chronic HD patients coming from regionally distinct areas, the continental and the maritime one. The aim {{was to examine the}} hypothetic influence of their different dietary habits on lipid profile. The study included 72 patients from continental region (39 men) and 50 from maritime part of the country (30 men). Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, liver disease, alcoholics as well as sevelamer treated patients were not included. Prior to a HD session the patients were determined fasting total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, total proteins, albumins and C-reactive protein serum concentrations. All patients were undergoing bicarbonate hemodialysis with polysulphone dialysers of low permeability. The continental group of patients were somewhat older, undergoing HD for longer period of time, of lower height, greater weight, greater body mass index, higher total (4. 70 ± 0. 91 : 4. 42 ± 1. 02 mmol/L), and LDL-cholesterol (2. 78 ± 0. 74 : 2. 66 ± 0. 75 mmol/L) concentrations, while lower triglycerides (1. 72 ± 0. 84 : 1. 81 ± 0. 83 mmol/L) and HDL-cholesterol (1. 13 ± 0. 42 : 1. 16 ± 0. 54 mmol/L). However, all the differences were without statistical significance. Chi-square test showed that the continental group of patients consumed more often pork, bacon, smoked and cured meats, margarine, butter, walnuts, almonds, garlic, cream and <b>full-fat</b> <b>cheese</b> than fish. They prepare food more often with lard and sunflower oil. Almost every fourth continental patient received statins, while only every 25 th in the maritime group of patients. There were not any statistically significant Chi-square values for differences in frequencies of patients with total cholesterol greater than 5. 2 mmol/L, triglycerides above 1. 6 mmol/L, HDL-cholesterol less than 1. 1 mmol/L, LDL-cholesterol greater than 2. 6 mmol/L, obesity and malnutrition between the two groups. Based on {{the results of this study}} we have concluded that diet has significant influence on lipid profile of HD patients. Even though the continental and the maritime groups of patients differed significantly in diet, they were similar in plasmatic lipoprotein concentrations. However, this similarity was ascribed only to statin treatment, which was more frequent in the continental group of patients. The influence of ESRD and HD as a method of renal replacement therapy on lipid profile was not more dominant than diet...|$|E
5000|$|Cornish Blue is {{a cheese}} {{made by the}} Cornish Cheese Company at Upton Cross and was {{recognised}} in December 2010 as the winning cheese in the World Cheese Awards. Cornish Brie is a brie style, soft, white rinded Cheese produced by several makers in Cornwall. Gevrik is a soft, <b>full-fat</b> goat's milk <b>cheese</b> produced in Trevarrian near Newquay. The name means [...] "little goat" [...] in Cornish. Keltic Gold {{is a type of}} semi-hard cheese made by Whalesborough Farm Foods. Menallack and Nanterrow cheeses are made at Menallack Farm near Penryn. Tesyn is a type of smoked Goat's milk cheese made by the firm Cornish Cuisine. Cornish Yarg is a semi-hard cow's milk cheese made in Cornwall. Before being left to mature, this cheese is carefully wrapped in nettle leaves to form an edible, though mouldy, rind. The texture varies from creamy and soft immediately under the nettle coating to a Caerphilly cheese-like crumbly texture in the middle. Modern production is at Pengreep Farm near Truro, by Lynher Dairies from an old recipe. Lynher Dairies also make Cornish Garland and Tiskey Meadow.|$|R
40|$|Low-fat Caciotta-type cheeses were {{manufactured}} with partially {{skim milk}} (fat content of similar to 0. 3 %) alone (LFC); with the supplementation of 0. 5 % (wt/vol) microparticulated {{whey protein concentrate}} (MWPC) (LFC-MWPC); with MWPC and exopolysaccharides (EPS) -producing Streptococcus thermophilus ST 446 (LFC-MWPC-EPS); and with MWPC, EPS-producing strain ST 446, and Lactobacillus plantarum LP and Lactobacillus rhamnosus LRA as adjunct cultures (LFC-MWPC-EPS-A). The non-EPS-producing isogenic variant Streptococcus thermophilus ST 042 was used for making <b>full-fat</b> Caciotta-type <b>cheese</b> (FFC), LFC, and LFC-MWPC. Cheeses were characterized based on compositional, microbiological, biochemical, texture, volatile components (purge and trap, and solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas chromatographymass spectrometry), and sensory analyses. Compared with FFC and LFC (51. 6 +/- 0. 7 to 53. 0 +/- 0. 9 %), the other cheese variants retained higher levels of moisture (60. 5 +/- 1. 1 to 67. 5 +/- 0. 5 %). The MWPC mainly contributed to moisture retention. Overall, all LFC had approximately one-fourth (22. 6 +/- 0. 8 %) of the fat of FFC. Hardness of cheeses slightly varied over 7 d of ripening. Microbial EPS positively affected cheese texture, and the texture of LFC without MWPC or microbial EPS was excessively firm. Free amino acids were {{at the highest levels}} in LFC treatments (2, 705. 8 +/- 122 to 3, 070. 4 +/- 123 mg/kg) due to the addition of MWPC and the peptidase activity of adjunct cultures. Aldehydes, alcohols, ketones, sulfur compounds, and short- to medium-chain carboxylic acids differentiated LFC variants and FFC. The sensory attributes pleasant to taste, intensity of flavor, overall acceptability, and pleasant to chew variously described LFC-MWPC-EPS and LFC-MWPC-EPS-A. Based on the technology options used, low-fat Caciotta-type cheese (especially ripened for 14 d) has promising features to be further exploited as a suitable alternative to the full-fat variant...|$|R
40|$|Background and Objective: Reduced {{fat cheese}} often {{exhibits}} poor sensory quality {{due to the}} reduction of fat, which plays {{a critical role in}} flavor and texture. Therefore, there is the challenge to produce a reduced fat cheese with improved sensory attributes and texture that is also comparable to its full-fat counterpart. The main objective of this research was to investigate the effect of different adjunct starter cultures of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus helvetius and Lactococcus casei, alone or mixed, on the sensory prperties and volatile flavor compounds of reduced-fat cheddar cheeses (formulated with xanthan gum) and compare them with <b>full-fat</b> cheddar <b>cheese</b> during 75 -day ripening. Materials and Methods: Eight treatments according to completely randomized design with a control cheddar cheese (no adjunct starter cultures) were designed. Extraction of the volatiles was carried out using headspace solid phase microextraction. Identification and quantification of volatile flavor compounds were done by gas chromatography-Mass spectrophotometry and gas chromatography, respectively. The sensory analyses were carried out by the 5 -point hedonic scale, using trained panelists. Results and Conclusion: Among all the flavor compounds, more than 98 % of the headspace volatile flavor compounds belonged to aldehydes, ketons, esters, alcohols, and acids. As compared to non-inoculated full-fat control, the use of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactococcus casei and Lactococcus helveticus as adjunct starter cultures in the reduced fat cheddar cheese formulation increased the amount of volatile flavor compounds and enhanced the sensory attributes. The combination of this mixed culture with the reduced fat cheddar cheese containing xanthan gum as fat replacer is a viable alternative to improve the quality characteristics of reduced-fat cheddar cheese. Conflict of interest: The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the effect of}} color on low-fat cheese flavor perception and consumer acceptability. To understand the flavor preferences of the consumer population participating in the sensory testing, 4 brands of retail <b>full-fat</b> Cheddar <b>cheeses</b> labeled as mild, medium, or sharp were obtained. These cheeses were evaluated by a trained descriptive panel to generate a flavor profile for each cheese and then by consumer sensory panels. Overall and color liking were measured using a 9 -point hedonic scale, and flavor, chewiness, level of sharpness measured using a 5 -point just-about-right (JAR) scale (with 1 being not enough, 3 being just about right, and 5 being {{too much of the}} attribute). Subsequently, 9 low-fat Cheddar cheeses were manufactured using 3 levels of annatto (0, 7. 34, and 22 g/ 100 kg) and 3 levels of titanium dioxide (0, 7. 67, and 40 g/ 100 kg) using a randomized block design in duplicate. Cheeses were then evaluated by descriptive and consumer sensory panels. Each consumer testing consisted of 120 panelists who were mainly 18 to 35 yr of age (> 90 % of total populace) with > 60 % being frequent cheese consumers. Overall liking preference of the consumer group was for mild to medium cheese. Using the JAR scale, the medium cheeses were considered closest to JAR with a mean score of 3. 0, compared with 2. 4 for mild cheese and 3. 6 for sharp cheese. Among low-fat cheeses, color was shown to be important with consumer liking being negatively influenced when the cheese appearance was too translucent (especially when normal levels of annatto were used) or too white. Matching the level of titanium dioxide with the annatto level gave the highest liking scores and flavor perception closest to JAR. This study established a significant effect of color on overall liking of low-fat versions of Cheddar cheese...|$|R
