40|$|Judges are {{far from}} being a pampered lot, argues Sebastian De Brennan THE ‘outrageous luxury’ of senior Australian judges {{receiving}} holidays of up to seven weeks has been much commented on recently. The NSW Opposition legal affairs spokesman, Andrew Tink, is among those who say that current judicial holiday arrangements are a waste of taxpayers’ money, and others have said that such arrangements are out of step with contemporary workplace practice. But is questionable whether this is an accurate assessment of the situation or simply the usual rhetoric aimed at securing political mileage. For example, the media was quick to jump on the fact that former NSW Supreme Court judge Jeff Shaw, who recently resigned after crashing his car while allegedly four and a half times over the legal limit, had taken a trip to New Zealand earlier in the year at a cost of $ 4000 to taxpayers. Precisely what the link was between the car accident and judicial holidays nobody ventured to say, nor did any one bother {{to point out that the}} object of the trip was for he and other judges to attend a professional conference aimed at enhancing judicial skills. Before making blanket statements against judges we should not forget that Mr Shaw represents only one of the 46 full-time Supreme Court judges listed on the Lawlink NSW website, and for the large part judges are among the most exemplary members of the community. As a law graduand who had the opportunity to work as an intern with a Supreme Court Judge of NSW, I can only disagree with the suggestions that ‘judges are a pampered lot’ (see the Australian, 3 December 2004, p 15). During that internship I was required to sit through a trial in which the accused was charged with defrauding the Commonwealth government to the tune of $ 2 million through tax evasion. The trial, which was by no means atypical, went on for six weeks and was certainly one of the most exhausting mental experiences I have had to endure. It appeared that I was not the only one who had a tough time staying attentive: some of the jury panel dozed off only three days into the trial. All the while the judge for whom I worked remained astutely alert in what can only be described as a painstaking and arduous court case. Indeed, the judge concerned (like many of the judicial officers on his floor) seemed to spend most of his evenings in chambers writing up judgments, and it was not unusual to see many of them studiously researching over the weekend. Finally, it cannot be forgotten that most senior judges are paid significantly less on the bench than they were when they roamed the courts as Queen’s Counsel. This may pose great questions about the nature of our legal system, but until someone comes up with a superior one we should be wary of catchcries for radical change. The reality is that judicial officers, like academics, nurses, doctors and many other public sector employees, are being asked to do much more with less as part of a counterproductive culture of economic rationalisation. Despite the benefits heralded by its proponents, the result in the legal context has been continued backlogs, an inferior standard of justice and people being kept in gaol for longer than they should be. The argument that ‘justice delayed is justice denied’ is a real one. But it must be recognised that this has as much to do with inadequate funding on behalf of governments and the concomitant reductions in real terms of funding to Legal Aid and community legal centres, as it does <b>judicial</b> <b>vacations.</b> The sooner policy makers and the public alike recognise this, the sooner we will arrive at a more efficacious justice system. Reducing judicial holidays is not the answer. One only has to sit through a trial, or see first hand how hard most judges’ work, to realise that four to seven weeks holiday is pretty well deserved. • Sebastian De Brennan is a research associate with the Australian Expert Group in Industry Studies, College of Law and Business, University of Western Sydney Photo: Linda Macpherson/ iStockphoto. co...|$|E
40|$|As Representative John Dingell remarked in {{the best}} {{sentence}} ever said {{on the power of}} procedure over substance, “I’ll let you write the substance... you let me write the procedure, and I’ll screw you every time. ” 1 Accordingly, designing procedures for legislative rulemaking, a dominant feature of modern governance, has spawned one of the most contentious debates in all of administrative law. Compounding the stakes, over the last fifty years, the courts, with help from Congress and presidents, have relentlessly made rulemaking procedures more burdensome, impeding efforts to preserve the environment, protect workers, and forestall financial collapse, among other important agency missions. Review for “arbitrariness” is the source of most of the burdens that courts have imposed on agency rulemaking. Modern doctrine, often called “hard look review,” requires an agency to have, at the moment it adopts a rule, a justification strong enough to satisfy the demands of “reasoned decisionmaking. ” As a corollary, an agency can never rely on post hoc justifications to save a rule. This requirement of reasoned decisionmaking might itself sound eminently reasonable. As implemented in rulemaking, however, its demands are highly artificial, force agencies to waste time and resources on developing impenetrable explanations for their rules, encourage regulated parties to bloat the process, and increase the risk of <b>judicial</b> <b>vacation</b> of reasonable rules. To correct these problems, courts should allow agencies to defend their rules based on post hoc justifications—so long as they are based on information exposed to public scrutiny during the rulemaking process itself. This proposal may sound like administrative law heresy, but it has surprisingly strong roots both in historical and current practice. Adopting it would enhance agency effectiveness without undermining other important values, notably including accountability, fairness, and accuracy, served by current doctrine. The proposal also highlights a better, more flexible conception of “arbitrariness” review. As they discharge this ambiguous task, courts have an ongoing duty to recognize and balance the various competing values served by both rulemaking and its judicial review. Courts should abandon their current rigid orthodoxy and adopt the proposal because, in short, it strikes a better balance among these values...|$|R
