In his journal entry for 29 September <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> rabiforçado, modern Spanish rabihorcado or forktail.

500|$|In January 1871, George Jackson Mivart's On the Genesis of Species listed {{detailed}} {{arguments against}} natural selection, and claimed it included false metaphysics. Darwin made extensive {{revisions to the}} sixth edition of the Origin (this was the first edition in which <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "evolution" [...] which had commonly been associated with embryological development, though all editions concluded with the word [...] "evolved"), and added a new chapter VII, Miscellaneous objections, to address Mivart's arguments.|$|E
500|$|The Fault in Our Stars premiered to 300 {{guests at}} the Ziegfeld Theater in New York City on June 2, 2014. At the premiere, Green said: [...] "I didn't want to sell it, because Hollywood sucks at making unsentimental movies about illness." [...] The film was {{released}} on June 6, 2014. After the New York premiere, Evangeline Earl, a student, announced that Green's book, from which the film was adapted, had been inspired by her sister Esther Earl, who had also been an author. Esther suffered from thyroid cancer and died in 2010. Evangeline said Esther had met Green at LeakyCon, a Harry Potter convention held in Boston in 2009. Green said, [...] "I could never have written The Fault in Our Stars without knowing Esther. Every word on that book depends on her." [...] Green said <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "okay" [...] {{in the book and}} the film because Hazel and Augustus used it to express their love for each other; it becomes a special word between them. The original novel was inspired by the late author Esther Earl, who used the word [...] "okay" [...] with her sister Abigail.|$|E
500|$|The {{communal}} {{understanding of}} redemption and human self-worth {{has changed since}} Newton's time. Since the 1970s, self-help books, psychology, and some modern expressions of Christianity have viewed this disparity in terms of grace being an innate quality within all people who must be inspired or strong enough to find it: something to achieve. In contrast to Newton's vision of wretchedness as his willful sin and distance from God, wretchedness has instead come to mean an obstacle of physical, social, or spiritual nature to overcome {{in order to achieve}} a state of grace, happiness, or contentment. Since its immense popularity and iconic nature, [...] "grace" [...] and the meaning behind the words of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] have become as individual as the singer or listener. Bruce Hindmarsh suggests that the secular popularity of [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] is due to the absence of any mention of God in the lyrics until the fourth verse (by Excell's version, the fourth verse begins [...] "When we've been there ten thousand years"), and that the song represents the ability of humanity to transform itself instead of a transformation taking place at the hands of God. [...] "Grace", however, to John Newton had a clearer meaning, as <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> to represent God or the power of God.|$|E

500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I hate this 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
2500|$|ARMITAGE: Well, even Mr. Novak {{has said}} that <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "operative" [...] and misused it. No one ever said [...] "operative." [...] And I not only assumed it, as I say, I've never seen a covered agent's name in a memo. However, that doesn't take away from what Mrs. Plame said, it was foolish, yeah. Sure it was.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{the three}} {{scientists}} did not coin the word entanglement, {{nor did they}} generalize the special properties of the state they considered. Following the EPR paper, Erwin Schrödinger {{wrote a letter to}} Einstein in German in which <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Verschränkung (translated by himself as entanglement) [...] "to describe the correlations between two particles that interact and then separate, as in the EPR experiment." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Satolep" [...] is an anagram for Pelotas, {{city where}} the artist was born. In his book [...] "A Estetica do Frio", the author {{mentions}} that Satolep is his idealization of his hometown. <b>He</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> in several songs and writing works.|$|R
5000|$|Several times Rose {{defended his}} <b>use</b> of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'nigger'. In one 1989 interview, {{he stated that}} <b>he</b> had <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> in {{reference}} to the John Lennon song [...] "Woman Is the Nigger of the World". Rose also claimed that <b>he</b> had <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> because it was considered taboo.|$|R

2500|$|In March 2009, Pardew stated on Match of the Day 2 that Chelsea midfielder Michael Essien [...] "absolutely rapes" [...] Manchester City player Ched Evans {{during a}} midfield tussle for the ball, {{in the sense}} that he bested him physically. The BBC {{explained}} why there was no on-air apology, saying: [...] "What Alan Pardew said was misheard, it was thought <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> 'rakes.'".|$|E
2500|$|Some {{controversy}} {{surrounded the}} use of the word in Wagner's own circle: Wagner never authorised {{the use of}} the word leitmotiv, using words such as [...] "Grundthema" [...] (basic idea), or simply [...] "Motiv". [...] His preferred name for the technique was Hauptmotiv (principal motif), which he first used in 1877; the only time <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Leitmotiv, he referred to [...] "so-called Leitmotivs".|$|E
2500|$|In 1879 German {{journalist}} Wilhelm Marr {{published a}} pamphlet, Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet (The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective) in which <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Semitismus interchangeably {{with the word}} Judentum to denote both [...] "Jewry" [...] (the Jews as a collective) and [...] "jewishness" [...] (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>word</b> [...] "prole" [...] is a {{shortening}} of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> proletarian, a {{term for}} the working class. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> was popularized by George Orwell in his 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, in which <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> proles (collective noun) {{to refer to the}} working class of Oceania (i.e. the proletariat).|$|R
50|$|But when Boethius {{comments}} {{on this text}} he illustrates Aristotle's doctrine with the now-famous diagram, and <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>wording</b> 'Some man is not just'. So this must have seemed to {{him to be a}} natural equivalent in Latin. It looks odd to us in English, but he wasn't bothered by it.|$|R
2500|$|Authors {{who have}} {{borrowed}} Latin mnemonics from Latin textbooks {{for their own}} works include Thomas Middleton and Benjamin Britten. For example, in Britten's opera The Turn of <b>the</b> Screw, <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> of a Latin mnemonic {{that he had found}} in a Latin grammar book belonging to Myfanwy Piper's aunt for Miles' [...] "malo" [...] song.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} recorded idea {{of infinity}} comes from Anaximander, a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher {{who lived in}} Miletus. <b>He</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> apeiron which means infinite or limitless. However, the earliest attestable accounts of mathematical infinity come from Zeno of Elea (born [...] ), a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher of southern Italy {{and member of the}} Eleatic School founded by Parmenides. Aristotle called him the inventor of the dialectic. He {{is best known for his}} paradoxes, described by Bertrand Russell as [...] "immeasurably subtle and profound".|$|E
2500|$|Spinoza was {{considered}} to be an atheist because <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "God" [...] (Deus) to signify a concept that was different from that of traditional Judeo–Christian monotheism. [...] "Spinoza expressly denies personality and consciousness to God; he has neither intelligence, feeling, nor will; he does not act according to purpose, but everything follows necessarily from his nature, according to law...." [...] Thus, Spinoza's cool, indifferent God is the antithesis to the concept of an anthropomorphic, fatherly God who cares about humanity.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after, Allen's {{campaign}} {{held that}} <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{in reference to}} Sidarth's hairstyle. Although Sidarth was wearing a baseball cap {{on the day of}} the incident, he had been conversing casually with Allen's aides during campaign stops before the incident. Allen's campaign staff claim to have referred to him privately as [...] "Mohawk". A now widely disseminated photo of Sidarth, hosted by the Webb campaign, shows Sidarth's hair to be longer in the middle and shaved on the sides, typical of a mohawk.|$|E

5000|$|In Book III of his Politics (1279a), Aristotle {{seems to}} {{indicate}} that, in principle, politeia refers generically to any form of government or constitution, although <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> also to call a particular form of government: “When the citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments (politeion), government (politeia)”.|$|R
6000|$|... 4. Wa'r--the broken stony surface, {{over which}} camels either cannot travel, or travel with difficulty: {{it is the}} horror of the Bedawi; and, when <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word,</b> it usually means that it causes man to dismount. It may be of two kinds; either the Majrá proper ("divide") or the Nakb ("pass"), and the latter may safely be left to the reader's imagination.|$|R
2500|$|In August 2013, it was {{announced}} that Baldwin was getting his own weekly show in MSNBC's primetime line-up. It was set to run on Friday at 10 p.m. ET. On September 5, 2013, MSNBC announced Baldwin's show would be called Up Late with Alec Baldwin. On November 26, 2013, the program was cancelled after only five episodes, due in part to a street tirade captured on video. TMZ claimed Baldwin's insult toward the videographer was [...] "cocksucking fag". Baldwin, who denied that <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "fag", later cited this incident as a major turning point in his public life.|$|E
2500|$|The next {{contributor}} of importance is Binet (1811, 1812), who formally stated the theorem {{relating to the}} product of two matrices of m columns and n rows, which for the special case of [...] reduces to the multiplication theorem. On the same day (November 30, 1812) that Binet presented his paper to the Academy, Cauchy also presented one on the subject. (See Cauchy–Binet formula.) In this <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> determinant in its present sense, summarized and simplified what was then known on the subject, improved the notation, and gave the multiplication theorem with a proof more satisfactory than Binet's. With him begins the theory in its generality.|$|E
2500|$|On 9 September 1901, {{at the age}} of 36, he {{died from}} {{complications}} due to alcoholism and syphilis at his mother's estate, Château Malromé in Saint-André-du-Bois. He is buried in Cimetière de Verdelais, Gironde, a few kilometres from the estate. Toulouse-Lautrec's last words reportedly were [...] "Le vieux con!" [...] ("the old fool"), his goodbye to his father, though another version has been suggested, in which <b>he</b> <b>used</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "hallali", a term used by huntsmen at the moment the hounds kill their prey: [...] "Je savais, papa, que vous ne manqueriez pas l'hallali" [...] ("I knew, papa, that you wouldn't miss the death.").|$|E
5000|$|The {{character}} {{is most often}} noted for exclaiming [...] "Bah! Humbug!" [...] despite uttering this phrase only twice in <b>the</b> entire story. <b>He</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "Humbug" [...] on its own on seven occasions, although on the seventh we are told he [...] "stopped at the first syllable" [...] after realizing Marley's ghost is real. <b>The</b> <b>word</b> is never <b>used</b> again {{after that in the}} book.|$|R
2500|$|Throughout {{his career}} Citino has {{advocated}} changing the current nomenclature of German military tactics. [...] Although <b>he</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Blitzkrieg on <b>the</b> cover of his books, {{he has always}} espoused the view {{that it should be}} called by its proper German military term, Bewegungskrieg, or maneuver warfare. Citino has taught courses on Nazi Germany and American military history, including Korea, Vietnam, and the Cold War.|$|R
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>uses</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> mock to mean both [...] "to taunt" [...] and [...] "to cheat (out of)". The {{tennis ball}} insult becomes Henry's {{justification}} for his invasion of France, and {{allows him to}} absolve himself {{of responsibility for the}} suffering he will cause. Supposedly, he is not to blame—it is allegedly the Dauphin's mock (or [...] "jest") that will cheat women out of their husbands, etc.|$|R
