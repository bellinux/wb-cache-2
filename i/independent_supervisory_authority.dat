Where a business has multiple establishments in the EU, {{it will have a}} single SA as its “lead authority”, based on the location of its [...] "main establishment" [...] (i.e., the place where the main processing activities take place). The lead authority will act as a [...] "one-stop shop" [...] to supervise all the processing activities of that business throughout the EU (Articles 46-55 of the GDPR). A European Data Protection Board (EDPB) will coordinate the SAs. EDPB will replace Article 29 Working Party.|$|E
40|$|EU data {{protection}} law has, to date, been monitored and enforced in a decentralised way by <b>independent</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities</b> in each Member State. While the independence of these <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities</b> is {{an essential element of}} EU {{data protection}} law, this decentralised governance structure has led to competing claims from <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities</b> regarding the national law applicable to a data processing operation and the national authority responsible for enforcing the data protection rules. These competing claims, evident in investigations conducted into the data protection compliance of Google and Facebook, jeopardise the objectives of the EU data protection regime. The new General Data Protection Regulation will revolutionise data protection governance by providing for a centralised decision-making body, the European Data Protection Board. While this agency will ensure the ‘Europeanisation’ of {{data protection law}}, given the nature and the extent of this Board’s powers it marks another significant shift in the EU’s agency-creating process and must therefore also be considered in its broader EU context...|$|R
40|$|The recent global {{financial}} crisis has spurred {{renewed interest in}} identifying those reforms in bank regulation that would work best to promote bank development, performance and stability. Building upon three recent world-wide surveys on bank regulation (, and), we contribute to this assessment by examining whether bank regulation, supervision and monitoring enhance or impede bank operating efficiency. Based on an un-balanced panel analysis of 4050 banks observations in 72 countries over the period 1999 – 2007, we find that tighter restrictions on bank activities are negatively associated with bank efficiency, while greater capital regulation stringency is marginally and positively associated with bank efficiency. We also find that a strengthening of official supervisory power is positively associated with bank efficiency only in countries with <b>independent</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities.</b> Moreover, independence coupled with a more experienced <b>supervisory</b> <b>authority</b> tends to enhance bank efficiency. Finally, market-based monitoring of banks in terms of more financial transparency is positively associated with bank efficiency...|$|R
50|$|These tasks {{mentioned}} above {{have been performed}} by the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate ENSI since 1 January 2009. In accordance with a law adopted by the Federal Assembly, the HSK was separated from the Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) and was converted into an <b>independent</b> regulatory <b>supervisory</b> <b>authority.</b> This step satisfied the requirement for {{the independence of the}} regulatory body as stipulated in the Convention on Nuclear Safety, a legal text adopted at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in 1994 and setting the bases for nuclear safety worldwide and ratified by Switzerland subsequently.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the status and {{organization}} of the Supreme Audit Office (SAO), which carries out the external audit of public administration in the Czech Republic. For easier orientation in the area offers this work {{in the first part}} the theoretical foundation of control in public administration. At the beginning of the analysis is presented the historical development of the highest accounting controls in the territory of today's Czech Republic. In three analytic blocks are listed the findings, which were based on research resources, particularly in the area of constitutional, administrative and financial law and on the study of the legislation and professional publications. SAO status as an <b>independent</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authority</b> in the Czech legal system is examined in terms of its inclusion in the Constitution and further discussed is the scope SAO and its relation to local government. Linked to this is especially the current proposed change of the Constitution and the Law on the Supreme Audit Office, which is also reflected in the work. This work also introduces the issue of the status of the SAO in the system of public power. The relation of the Supreme Audit Office to other public authorities is partially analysed. Investigated are also the position and competences of authorities within the SAO. In a separate chapter, based on the analysis presented and evaluated, there are the conclusions and suggestions for possible modifications of the law de lege ferenda...|$|E
40|$|Pravo na pristup informacijama čini jedan od ključnih elemenata informacijskoga upravnog prava. Od ožujka 2013. na snazi je novi (drugi) hrvatski Zakon o pravu na pristup informacijama. Zakon se naslanja na solidne temelje Zakona iz 2003., noveliranog 2010. / 2011., te u većini segmenata regulacije čini daljnji korak naprijed, osobito u pogledu definiranja obveznika primjene Zakona, nadogradnje uređenja testa razmjernosti i javnog interesa, jačanja ovlasti nadzornog tijela, te proširenja obveznih aktivnih mjera javnog sektora. Ipak, ostaje nekoliko otvorenih pitanja, prije svega vezanih za izuzeća iz primjene Zakona, organizacijsko odvajanje od nadzora nad zaštitom osobnih podataka, stvarnu nadležnost u upravnom sporu, imperkfektnost odredbi o inspekcijskom nadzoru, te propuštanje makar elementarne regulacije položaja tzv. zviždača. Right {{to access}} {{information}} makes {{an essential part}} of the information administrative law. Since March of 2013 the new (second) Croatian Act on Right to Access Information has been in force. The Act rests on the solid foundation of the 2003 Act (amended 2010 / 2011). In most segments of the regulation, the new Act makes a step forward, especially in terms of defining the entities of public sector obliged by the Act, upgrading the regulation of the test of proportionality and of public interest, strenghtening the powers of the <b>independent</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authority,</b> and enlargement of mandatory active measures of the public sector. However, there are some open questions, primarily related to the exemptions from the application of the Act, the organizational separation of control over access of information in relation to the protection of personal data, jurisdiction in administrative disputes, imperfect provisions on inspection, and omission to regulate (at least on the elemental level) the position of whistleblowers...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{triggered}} by a perceived loss of control of governments over societal developments, due to globalization and technological developments, which inhibit the effective protection of essential values in democratic societies. Privacy and data protection are essential values in democratic societies, which {{are subject to the}} rule of law. The EU Treaties have granted the Union a widely formulated role in ensuring effective protection of these fundamental rights of the individual, by means of judicial review, legislation and supervision by independent authorities. Hence, the imperative of protection is laid down at the constitutional level, empowering the Union to play its role as constitutional guardian of these two fundamental rights. More precisely, Article 16 TFEU, read in connection with Articles 7 and 8 of the Charter of the Fundamental Rights of the Union, lays down the tasks of the EU in relation to privacy and data protection as fundamental rights for individuals. The mandate under Article 16 TFEU is broadly formulated and gives the Union - in principle - the power to act, and make a difference. This is a subject where the EU can act successfully, by addressing a problem with a global scale and which is technologically difficult. This specific mandate of the EU in respect of privacy and data protection {{is the subject of this}} study. The study analyses the contributions of the specific actors and roles within the EU framework: the judiciary, the EU legislator, the <b>independent</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>authorities,</b> the cooperation mechanisms of these authorities, as well as the EU as actor in the external domain. The legitimacy and the effectiveness of the EU and of the operation of the actors and roles within the EU framework are important perspectives for this analysis...|$|R
40|$|Manuscript Type Empirical. Research Question/Issue Do {{cooperative}} banks {{suffer from}} board deficiencies less frequently and severely than joint-stock banks? To answer this question, we analyze banks operating in Italy {{during the period}} 2006 - 2012 to examine whether the governing bodies of cooperative banks are less effective in carrying out their duties than those of joint-stock banks. Deficiencies in the governing body are measured by sanctions imposed by the <b>supervisory</b> <b>authority.</b> Research Findings/Insights Findings revealed that the boards of directors of cooperative banks were sanctioned more often than {{board of directors of}} joint-stock banks. Furthermore, board turnover mediates the relationship between the cooperative status and board deficiencies. Theoretical/Academic Implications This study provides empirical evidence in support of the weakness of corporate governance in cooperative banks. Methodologically, our approach is novel in that we adopt a measure of board effectiveness/deficiency based on an <b>independent</b> third-party perspective (<b>supervisory</b> <b>authority)</b> that is not biased by the different objective function of the two types of banks. Practitioner/Policy Implications The findings have several policy and managerial implications. We contribute to the ongoing debate on the proposal for flexible regulation of corporate governance for cooperative banks and emphasize that policy-makers and regulators should rethink the corporate governance structures of cooperative banks. In particular, the study reveals how board turnover should be carefully monitored to reduce board deficiencies at the bank level...|$|R
