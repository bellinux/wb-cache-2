50|$|First flown on 8 July 1985, the −300 is {{dimensionally}} {{identical to}} the −200, although it provides an increased Maximum Take-Off Weight (MTOW) {{and an increase in}} range, provided by additional centre and horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> (trim-tank) fuel <b>tanks.</b> This model also introduced wingtip fences to improve aerodynamic efficiency, a feature that has since been retrofitted to some −200s. The aircraft entered service in 1986 with Swissair. The A310-300 incorporates a computerised fuel distribution system which allows it to be trimmed in flight, optimising the centre of gravity by shuttling up to 5000 kg of fuel {{in and out of the}} horizontal <b>stabilizer</b> <b>tank,</b> controlled by a Center of Gravity Control Computer.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe theory of Roll stabilization of Ships {{is presented in}} the context of modern control theory. The most common systems used to reduce the roll are described, and the principal equations are formulated. A general approach for the analysis of roll stabilizers is developed and it is applied to an activated fin stabilizer system. For this approach parameter plane techniques were applied, and the system was simulated in the Digital Computer by means of the Continuous System Modeling Program CSMP-IBM/ 360. Finally a system is proposed which is intended to improve the performance of passive <b>tank</b> <b>stabilizers</b> introducing fluidic devices in the feedback loop in addition to a supply of air compressed to actuate on the water ballast. The system was simulated using the same program CSMP-IBM/ 360, and the results compared with those obtained in the simulation of a simple passive <b>tank</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> showing a significant increasing in the damping.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} investigate the influence of vitamin C on growth and survival rate of freshwater prawn larvae. The treatment dosages of vitamin C were 0. 0, and 0. 75 mg/L. Each treatment was in triplicates and arranged in a complete randomized design. Vitamin C {{was given to the}} larval rearing media every three days.  Larvae were cultured in six conical fibreglass tanks of 50 L volume installed in a fibreglass tank (2 m x 0. 8 m x 0. 8 m) filled with water for temperature <b>stabilizer.</b> Each conical <b>tank</b> was stocked with 6, 500 larvae (nauplii). Artemia nauplii were given on D 3 and egg custard as artificial feed on D 9. Larval rearing was done for 25 days in constant temperature (29 oC– 31 oC) using automatic heater. Statistical analysis showed that metamorphosis speed of larvae was significantly affected by adding of vitamin C (P 0. 05). Addition of vitamin C also resulted in a better growth of freshwater prawn larvae...|$|R

5000|$|In autumn 1944, Pietsch left Hudson to {{work for}} Briggs Manufacturing Company, a company founded in 1908 by Walter Owen Briggs (1877-1952) that became the world's largest {{independent}} producer of automobile bodies. During the war, the company was a major supplier for the U.S. military, producing over a billion dollars worth of steel and aluminum products. In 1944, a record workforce of some 31,000 men and women built {{a wide variety of}} items, including aircraft gun turrets, wings, <b>stabilizers,</b> ailerons, <b>tank</b> hulls, bomb and wheel doors for the B-29, to mention only a few.10 But by September 1944, when Pietsch signed on, they were already looking ahead to post-war car designs, and efforts were underway to secure contracts for automotive bodies from Packard and Chrysler, among other companies.10 Early styling projects assigned to Pietsch included work on the Packard Clipper as well as some formal limousines on Chrysler chassis, and [...] "special sedans," [...] some designed specifically for Walter P. Chrysler and others for W. O. Briggs himself, none of which were ever built.|$|R

This paper describes the performance of a U-Tube passive <b>tank</b> <b>stabilizer</b> system deployed in an Offshore Supply Vessel. A properly tuned system can result in appreciable roll reduction. Analytical and experimental results are presented and discussed. The suppression of roll motion in the resonance period demonstrates that the system can be effectively designed for a particular vessel with knowledge of specific ship based data such as location of tank, effect of the mass of fluid in tank, and the natural roll period of the tank. The salient conclusions are brought ou...|$|R

The Deep Submergence Rescue Vehicle is being built with an activated roll stabilization system. The effectiveness of t his system is limited by pump saturation. This investigation is concerned with improving the roll stabilization of the DSRV {{through the use of a}} passive <b>tank</b> <b>stabilizer.</b> A mathematical model for the tank system is developed and adapted to the DSRV model. The passive system is extended to include two modes of operation, each representing a separate tank frequency, which may be selected by the operation of a valve. The passive system and the dual mode system are simulated on an analog computer to determine their response to transient disturbances...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} is to develop an accurate and efficient analytic solution for predicting high frequency radiation patterns of fuselage-mounted airborne antennas. This is an analytic study of airborne antenna patterns using the Uniform Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (UTD). The aircraft is modeled in its most basic form so that the solution is applicable to general-type aircraft. The fuselage is modeled as a perfectly conducting composite ellipsoid; whereas, the wings, <b>stabilizers,</b> nose, fuel <b>tanks,</b> and engines, are simulated as perfectly conducting flat plates that can {{be attached to the}} fuselage and/or to each other. The composite-ellipsoid fuselage model is necessary to successfully simulate the wide variety of real world fuselage shapes. Since the antenna is mounted on the fuselage, it has a dominant effect on the resulting radiation pattern so it must be simulated accurately, especially near the antenna. Various radiation patterns are calculated for commercial, private, and military aircraft, and the Space Shuttle Orbiter. The application of this solution to numerous practical airborne antenna problems illustrates its versatility and design capability. In most cases, the solution accuracy is verified by the comparisons between the calculated and measured data...|$|R
40|$|The {{undesirable}} effects of roll motion of ships (rocking about the longitudinal axis) became noticeable {{in the mid-nineteenth}} century when significant changes were introduced to the design of ships as a result of sails being replaced by steam engines and the arrangement being changed from broad to narrow hulls. The combination of these changes led to lower transverse stability (lower restoring moment for a given angle of roll) with the consequence of larger roll motion. The increase in roll motion and its effect on cargo and human performance lead to the development several control devices that aimed at reducing and controlling roll motion. The control devices most commonly used today are fin <b>stabilizers,</b> rudder, anti-roll <b>tanks,</b> and gyrostabilizers. The use of different types of actuators for control of ship roll motion has been amply demonstrated for over 100 years. Performance, however, can still fall short of expectations because of difficulties associated with control system design, which have proven to be far from trivial due to fundamental performance limitations and large variations of the spectral characteristics of wave-induced roll motion. This short article provides an overview of the fundamentals of control design for ship roll motion reduction. The overview is limited to the most common control devices...|$|R
5000|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 1950s, the personnel of the OKB-520 design bureau of the Stalin Ural Tank Factory No. 183 (Uralvagonzavod) had been changed considerably. Morozov was replaced by Kolesnikow, who in turn was replaced by Leonid N. Kartsev in March 1953. The first decision of the new designer was to fit the 100 mm D-10T tank gun with the STP-1 [...] "Gorizont" [...] vertical <b>stabilizer.</b> The new <b>tank</b> gun received the designation D-10TG and was fitted into the T-54's turret. The new tank received night vision equipment for the driver and was designated T-54A (Ob'yekt 137G). Originally, this had a small muzzle counter-weight, which was later replaced with a fume extractor. It was equipped with an OPVT wading snorkel, the TSh-2A-22 telescopic sight, TVN-1 infrared driver's periscope and IR headlight, a new R-113 radio, multi-stage engine air filter and radiator controls for improved engine performance, an electrical oil pump, a bilge pump, an automatic fire extinguisher and extra fuel tanks. The tank officially entered production in 1954 and service in 1955. It served as a basis for T-54AK command tank, with additional R-112 radio set (front line tanks were equipped with R-113 radio set), TNA-2 navigational device, ammunition load for the main gun decreased by 5 rounds and the AB-1-P/30 charging unit, which was produced in small numbers. In October 1954 a T-54A tank, designated as T-54M (Ob'yekt 139) served as a testbed for new D-54T and D-54TS 100 mm smoothbore guns and [...] "Raduga" [...] and [...] "Molniya" [...] stabilization systems, which were later used in the T-62. These were not completely successful, so further T-55 development continued to use the D-10 series guns. It was fitted with V-54-6 engine developing 581 hp (433 kW). It never went into production.|$|R
