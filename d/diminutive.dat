After defining basic concepts from morphology and lingu- istics the study focuses on traditional and pragmatic semantics of Spanish <b>diminutives.</b> The pragmatic {{point of view is}} the basis for analysis of particu- lar <b>diminutives.</b> In the conclusion, the traditional and pragmatic approaches to Spanish <b>diminutives</b> are compared...|$|R
50|$|The Portuguese {{language}} makes abundant use of <b>diminutives,</b> which connote small size, endearment or insignificance. <b>Diminutives</b> {{are very}} {{commonly used in}} informal language.

5|$|Despite {{striking}} {{differences in}} appearance, S.parthenopion {{may be most}} closely related to S.nicholsi. Like the <b>diminutive</b> S.parthenopion in the Virgin Islands, S.nicholsi, the smallest endemic sphaerodactylid in Puerto Rico, is very small. The geographic range of another species, S.townsendi, divides these two closely related populations, suggesting that S.townsendi evolved after S.parthenopion and S.nicholsi diverged.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} Late Middle Ages, the word elf {{began to be}} used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan-word fairy; in elite art and literature, at least, it also became {{associated}} with <b>diminutive</b> supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.|$|E

Queen Victoria's passion for Pugs was passed on to many {{other members of the}} Royal family, including her grandson King George V and his son King Edward VIII. Many responded to the breed's image of anti-functionalism and <b>diminutive</b> size during this period.|$|E

There is indeed a dark-colored, circular outline on this hill where grass does not grow, with no widely accepted cause.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} of the work's {{provenance}} before the 1840s. Given the panels' <b>diminutive</b> size—which is typical of early diptychs—it seems probable that the work was commissioned for private rather than public devotion. The notion of a well-educated patron, with knowledge of and appreciation for the art of earlier centuries, is reinforced by both the classical language inscriptions and the abundant detail found across {{all areas of the}} panels.|$|E

Although a number of aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications.|$|E
5|$|The name {{cerebellum}} is a <b>diminutive</b> of cerebrum (brain); it can {{be translated}} literally as little brain.

A single shot struck the brig, smashing into one of the 4-pounder cannon on deck and breaking it into three pieces, although none of the crew were wounded by the strike.|$|E

50|$|<b>Diminutives</b> {{are popular}} in {{everyday}} usage, and {{are by no}} means reserved for children. The Polish language allows for a great deal of creativity in this field. Most <b>diminutives</b> are formed by adding a suffix. For male names it may be -ek or the more affectionate -uś; for female names it may be -ka, or -nia / -dzia / -sia / cia respectively. Maria, a name whose standard form was once reserved to refer to the Virgin Mary, has a particularly great number of possible <b>diminutives,</b> which include: Marysia, Maryśka, Marysieńka, Marychna, Mania, Mańka, Maniusia, Maryna, Marianna, some of which (indicated by underlining) have eventually become treated as standard names of their own (probably having their own derivatives), while others (such as those in italics), are shared <b>diminutives</b> and are less popular (largely regarded as foreign).|$|R
