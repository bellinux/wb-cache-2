5|$|Many in Rome {{still thought}} {{reconciliation}} with England was possible, and Paul III elevated two English cardinals, John Fisher (at the time imprisoned {{and sentenced to}} death by <b>Henry</b> <b>VIII)</b> and Girolamo Ghinucci. The execution of Fisher prompted Paul III to excommunicate and purportedly depose <b>Henry</b> <b>VIII.</b> While Campeggio lived, no attempt was made in Rome to fill any of the thirteen episcopal vacancies in England.|$|E
5|$|Not {{knowing that}} <b>Henry</b> <b>VIII</b> had already {{secretly}} married the pregnant Anne Boleyn, Clement VII decided {{to reach out}} to the monarch by appointing Thomas Cranmer, an outspoken proponent of Henry VIII's annulment, as archbishop of Canterbury. A threatened excommunication was handed down when Cranmer pronounced Henry VIII's marriage null and void; <b>Henry</b> <b>VIII</b> responded by telling Campeggio's vicar general for Salisbury to stop all revenues from his bishopric until further notice. <b>Henry</b> <b>VIII</b> then claimed the authority to act on behalf of Campeggio in making various ecclesiastical appointments. The fifth session of the Reformation Parliament deprived Campeggio and Girolamo Ghinucci of their English sees (unless they swore loyalty to the king). Unaware of this statute, two days later on 23 March 1534 Campeggio entered Consistory for the final ruling against annulment.|$|E

A 8 February 1514 letter from Pope Leo X to <b>Henry</b> <b>VIII</b> of England flatters the king for having elevated the pope's cardinal-nephew and cousin as protector. The pope's brother Giuliano de' Medici was also made a Knight of the Garter (just as Guidobaldo II della Rovere had been made when della Rovere had been made protector).|$|E
