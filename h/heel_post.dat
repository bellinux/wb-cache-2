40|$|Diploma thesis "Facilitation and {{inhibition}} of trunk and lower extremity muscles using {{different types of}} shoes -surface polyEMG assessment" describes basic knowledge about human gait. The work summarizes important facts about gait development, physiological pattems and about impact of shoe types on kinematics and muscle activity during walking. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyze activity of eight muscles of trunk and of lower extremities and also to assess basíc temporal-spatial characteristics of gait using surface poly-EMG and forceplate during barefoot gait and while walking in different types of shoes. The analysis was carried out in a sample of 18 young healthy women during level walking. Outcomes indicate that every tested pair of shoes changes temporal-spatial characteristic as well as activity of trunk and lower extremities muscles compared to barefoot gait. In some cases outcomes showed statistically significant difference. According to our conc 1 usions cause of it was especially the weight of shoes and the instability of ankle and foot while walking in high <b>heels,</b> toe <b>post</b> sandals and "tapky".

40|$|Although {{walking is}} a {{constrained}} movement, there is {{variation in the}} muscle recruitment patterns. The processed wavelet-based electromyogram (EMG) [von Tscharner (2000) ] signals indicated that the task structure contained in walking doesn’t prescribe one single muscle activation strategy, and that multiple configurations of muscle activation can result in functionally equivalent postural control. By applying a principal component analysis approach, the intra-muscular analysis of EMG signals of healthy females while walking has shown that any activation pattern {{is a combination of}} (i) the group activation pattern used by all individuals, (ii) two common strategies – either a pre impact muscle activation or a <b>post</b> <b>heel</b> strike reaction – showing the subject-specific deviations and (iii) an unresolved, more random activation pattern. Suggestions that individuals have a constrained flexibility in how they balance their pre and <b>post</b> <b>heel</b> strike muscle activation. Especially at heel strike, where the human locomotor system is affected by irregular impact forces, controlled muscle activation strategies are essential for counteracting the destabilising forces and thus for keeping the joint stable [Hurley (1999) ]. The precisely timed co-activation of Mm. quadriceps femoris and M. semitendinosus is important for a mobile, but stable knee joint. A balanced activation of Mm. vastus medialis and vastus lateralis is furthermore required to control the translation of the patella [Mellor and Hodges (2005) ], and to maintain the dynamic stability of the patellofemoral joint. In addition to a high intra-muscular coordination found while walking, a significant inter-muscular interplay between muscles of the same muscle group and between muscles either located on the medial or on the lateral side of the knee has been found. Such an interaction showed that, in addition, to the within-muscle and within-muscle group controlling, there is a mechanism regulating the knee rotation and the fine tuning of muscles in order to control subtle changes in the interplay of structures surrounding the knee joint due to destabilising forces to gain a stable knee joint. The mechanism underlying neural control is complex, wherein typical temporal characteristics, such as rhythm at about 40 ms within the EMG signal or triggering to heel strike of peak activations while walking were structures occurring independent of the subject, muscle, task and condition. In {{view of the fact that}} individuals share these features, there seems to be good reasons that temporal features play an integral role within the neuromuscular control mechanism. Furthermore, the comparison between the EMG frequency spectra of sprint- and endurance trained athletes indicate that the EMG frequency spectra change systematically with training; thus the EMG signals mirror the functional state of a muscle as a component of the state of the individual and allow monitoring of training-related changes in muscles. The results of this thesis may be suggest that rhythm, synchronicity and neuromuscular activation strategies are brain-related features, which are quantifiable by combining waveletbased EMG signals with pattern recognition approaches. This approach provides a deeper insight into the muscular behaviour and the role of the neuromuscular control mechanisms in motor output, in general and between individuals. Further, it has increased the knowledge about the functional state of muscles that stabilise the knee joint. The various combinations in interactions of activation patterns of the thigh muscles surrounding the knee joint may be key functions to securing a stable knee joint before the occurrence of stressful events and may be a neuromuscular component of dynamic joint stability adapted to the subject-specific circumstances...|$|R
