5000|$|Beer critic Michael Jackson {{considered}} Orval to be [...] "a wonderful aperitif", and a [...] "world classic". [...] Its very distinctive {{taste is}} largely attributed to {{two parts of}} the brewing process.

The other is the use of Brettanomyces yeast during this same maturation, which are a local wild yeast. Hallertau, Styrian Goldings and French Strisselspalt hops are used.|$|E
50|$|The {{most celebrated}} English hop {{varieties}} are Fuggles and Goldings, although commercial pressures may incline brewers to use higher-yielding modern varieties. Modern brewers also sometimes {{make use of}} American or Continental hops. South-east England, particularly Kent, is the traditional hop growing area; brewers {{in the north and}} west used to economise on the cost of importing hops by producing beers with more of a malt character, a regional distinction that has not entirely vanished. A characteristic technique is <b>dry</b> <b>hopping,</b> where hops are added during the fermentation phase in addition to those that went into the initial boil. Worcestershire and Herefordshire has also been a major hop-growing area. The jargon of the areas is distinguished from that of Kent in certain words. Thus in Kent the drying house is known as an oast-house, in Worcestershire as a kiln, a hop-field is called a hop-garden, in Worcestershire a hop-yard.|$|E

40|$|Also with {{conventional}} hopping {{in compliance with}} the purity law it is possible to produce beers with a mild bitterness and distinct hop aroma. Here the examinations were made with three types of hopping each with 2 hop varieties in bottom-fermenting beers: - addition 20 minutes before end of boil and a late addition split between end of boil and in the whirlpool - hop addition split only between end of boil and in the whirlpool - <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> exclusively There was no first addition at begin of boil. The 6 beers were examined for bitter substances, polyphenols and selected aromatic substances. The spread of the analysis values was enormous: - EBC bitterness units 12 - 28 IBU - iso-alpha-acids 1 - 17 mg/L - hop polyphenols 71 - 126 mg/L - monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes 32 - 300 µg/L - linalool + geraniol 198 - 838 µg/L - esters 72 - 793 µg/L By adjusting the time of hopping between middle of boil, end of boil and <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> you can achieve almost any beer bitterness. In addition, you have a practically infinite range for aroma impressions through the dose and choice of hop variety or varieties. Consequently, bitterness and hop aroma can also be separated from each other by using conventional pelletsstatus: publishe...|$|E
40|$|If {{a certain}} type of beer is to be brewed with a strong hop aroma and a {{corresponding}} mild bitterness,the latter is difficult to be kept on a low level. Using for example hop pellets, with every hop dosage aroma as well as bitter compounds are transferred. When brewing beers with pronounced aroma and mild bitterness, the hop industry normally recommends the use of so-called “advanced products”,where aroma and bitter substances are separated and each of them can be custom dosed. These products have sensory disadvantages in beer due to their selective composition. Brewing trials have been conducted in which hop pellets of different varieties were used at mid and end of boiling as well as for <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> in different combinations in lager type beer. The transfer of aroma and bitter compounds are described analytically. In doing so, some surprising results are found in the bitter compounds. In this presentation, we want to show the way to create special and unique beers with a fully developed hop aroma and a pleasant, mild bitterness by using hop pellets in a late dosage and/or <b>dry</b> <b>hopping.</b> The dosage of the whole spectra of hop compounds is essential for a full-bodied character of these types of beer. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Being one of {{the most}} {{consumed}} beverages in the world, much effort has been made to reveal the structures responsible for the sensorial characteristics of beer. Yet, the knowledge on the precise contribution of hop-derived volatiles towards the hoppy aroma of beer is rather fragmented. For a long time, the aroma of fresh beer was believed to be mainly imparted by single compounds. However, increasing evidence showed that sensorial perception of the hoppy aroma of beer is more complex than originally assumed. Moreover, the factors responsible for the perceivable differences originating from distinct hop varieties used for late and <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> have not been fully revealed. In order to understand how the choice of the hop variety affects the final aroma of beer, we investigated in a previous study with four different hop varieties how the analytical composition of the volatile fraction changes throughout the brewing process and how that affects the composition of late and dry hopped beers. However, the analysis of four different hop varieties arose more questions. Therefore, in this study, we studied 15 other hop varieties during different stages along the brewing process of single hopped beers and analyzed wort and beer samples via headspace solid-phase micro extraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HSSPME GC-MS). Additionally, the profiles of the corresponding hop varieties were determined. This enabled the accurate determination of both the full spectrum of hop oil-derived compounds {{as well as of the}} higher esters and higher alcohols produced during fermentation. Our investigation reveals substantial changes in the volatile patterns of the wort and beer samples, in comparison with the selected hop variety, which arose from the boiling and fermentation processes, as well as the applied late and additional <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> techniques. Concentrations of the “floral” (e. g. oxygenated fraction of total hop essential oil composed of monoterpene alcohols, esters, ketones and aldehydes) and the sesquiterpenoid hop oil fractions changed significantly along the brewing process. As expected, concentrations of saturated esters and higher alcohols in beers were shown to be mainly influenced by the fermentation and not by the hop variety. Although the concentrations of practically all other compound classes (especially of linalool and geraniol as the most important monoterpene alcohols) were higher in the dry hopped beers, <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> does not affect the original intrinsic qualitative composition of hop oil constituents. Yet, substantial quantitative changes were observed. Furthermore, special attention was paid to the influence of additional <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> on the transfer behavior of selected hop derived-monoterpene alcohols. Transfer rates for linalool were comparable for all 15 hop varieties, whereas the transfer rates for geraniol differed significantly which indicates that the selected hop variety is of major importance. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Polyfunctional thiols {{contribute}} to the hop varietal aroma of beers [1], especially when <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> [2] or bottle refermentation [3] are applied. Very recently, a cysteine-S-conjugate [S- 3 -(hexan- 1 -ol) -cysteine] has been identified by HPLC/MS/MS in the Cascade variety [4]. Other cysteine adducts have been evidenced in Saaz, Nelson Sauvin and Tomahawk hops by enzymatic release assays [5]. Both methods were here applied on new "dual" hop varieties including Citra, Amarillo, Mosaïc and Hallertau Blanc.

40|$|When {{calculating the}} {{transfer}} rate of geraniol in dry hopped beers {{based solely on}} the initial value in hops, there are tremendous fluctuations of between about 40 % and over 200 %. Some varieties, including Cascade, Hallertau Blanc and Polaris, contain considerable amounts of geranyl acetate in addition to geraniol. However, since no trace of geranyl acetate {{can be found in the}} beer, even at high dosages, it can be concluded that at least under these conditions (<b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> before maturation and storage) geranyl acetate is hydrolyzed and geraniol is released. Including the dosage of geranyl acetate into the calculation of the transfer rates, this yields values of 36 % to 62 %, a variation clearly within the limits of error analysis. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Different beers with {{intensive}} hop {{additions to}} achieve a hop bouquet were aged for up to 700 days at 20 °C and 30 °C and {{the behavior of the}} hop aroma substances was examined, based on low oxygen bottling and the use of scavenger crown corks. Special attention was paid to the linalool, which produced the following results in summary: - the stereoisomers R-linalool and S-linalool are observed separately, because R-linalool is much more sensorily active than S-linalool - R-linalool as %-rel. of total linalool decreases about 30 % per year at 20 °C, S-linalool increases about 150 % per year - The R-linalool decreases from 90 % in fresh beer to 75 % within one year at 20 °C - Influences from the type of hopping (for example in the wort or <b>dry</b> <b>hopping)</b> or the type of beer (for example bottom fermenting or top fermenting) were not noticeable - Since R-linalool is sensorily much more active than S-linalool, the decrease in R-linalool plays a decisive role. Just the analysis of total linalool is not sufficient to describe sensory effects. The behavior of other aroma substances during storage at 20 °C can be defined as follows: - Monoterpenes were surprisingly stable; the sesquiterpenes too suffered only slight losses - Some carboxylic esters are relatively stable, the majority decreased by 12 and 20 % per 100 days at 20 °C - Of the monoterpene alcohols R-linalool decreased significantly, nerol and geraniol behaved differently, whereas alpha-terpineol and 1 -terpinen- 4 -ol increased - The oxidized sesquiterpenes decreased slightly - Beta-damascenone and 2 terpene ethers increased significantly The examinations did not include sensory assesment. Obviously the decrease in R-linalool leads to less hoppy-floral notes and the loss of some esters means less fruity notes. Overall the hop aroma substances proved to be more stable than presumed. A hop aroma in the beer will change during beer aging but will not completely disappear depending on the original impact. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether storage temperature or hopping method had influence on the aroma and bitterness in beer. The focus was set on the aroma that comes from hops, and not from yeast. The secondary objective to this study was to explore the development of the alcohol, CO 2 and bitterness in the beer after priming and bottling. The thesis’ main perspective is that of home brewers, and to some extent that of microbreweries. Beer was brewed with 100 % pilsner malt and hopped with Cascade and Vic Secret hop pellets. Cascade was used both for bittering and for aroma. Vic Secret was only used for aroma. Three batches of beer were brewed two times. The beer was brewed in the 60 L brewery in the Pilot plant at NMBU. All three batches were boiled for 90 minutes. The same amount of Cascade hops were added to all three batches for bittering for 60 and 30 minutes boiling time. Aroma hops were added to brews 1 and 4 for 5 minutes, and to brews 2 and 6 at 80 °C post boiling. Aroma hops were added to brews 3 and 6 (<b>dry</b> <b>hopping)</b> on the day of racking into the secondary fermenter. After bottling, half of the bottles were stored at 4 °C and the other half were stored at room temperature. This process was repeated once ending with a total of six batches where batches 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6 have undergone the same treatment. Six brews and two different storage temperatures resulted in 12 bottles to be tested seven times over the course of two months. At day 1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 after bottling samples were gathered. Aroma was measured in the beers stored at both temperatures using GC-MS. The GC-MS resulted in detection of typical hop and yeast aromas, however a clear pattern in the development of the aromas could not be found. CO 2, percent alcohol, color and haze were measured on the test days using the Anton Paar Alcolyzer. The development of the alcohol and CO 2 increased fast the first 5 days after bottling and then seemed to stabilize after day 20. Color and haze both decreased during storage, the storage temperature did not have a significant effect on these. Bitterness was measured using UV spectrophotometry. The bitterness kept fluctuating between 40 and 60 IBUs after bottling, suggesting that development of bitterness is not set by the calculated bitterness and the amount of bittering hops added. Sensory evaluation was executed on days 30 and 60 after bottling. The sensory evaluation was carried out using a triangle test where room temperature stored beer was compared to 4 °C cold stored beer.

40|$|Fruits, {{flowers or}} other plant parts, possess a {{characteristic}} aroma which is {{formed by the}} presence of flavour-active volatile compounds. Besides volatiles in a free form, volatiles also occur in a glycosidic boundform. Conjugation of volatile compounds to sugar substances like β-D-glucose results in water soluble, non-volatile and odourless compounds. Physiologically, this glycoconjugation plays a role in the accumulation, storage and transport of different types of compounds in the plant. Hops (Humulus lupulus L.) and sour cherries (Prunus cerasus L.) contain glycosidically bound flavour compounds as well. Hence, when adding these raw materials during the production of beverages like beer, free volatiles as well as glycosidically bound volatiles are extracted into the medium. Although the bound fraction is not readily perceivable as aroma, it forms a pool of flavour precursors. This work aimed at the exploitation of the flavour potential through enzymatic hydrolysis ofthese glycosidically bound volatiles. The global enzymatic activity responsible for hydrolysis of glycosidically bound volatile compounds is referred to as glycoside hydrolase activity. In fermented beverages, a method for introducing this glycoside hydrolase activity into the medium is the use of an appropriately selected yeast strain. Hence, the aim of this work was to acquire insight in the hydrolase activity of yeast towards glycosidically bound flavour compounds from hops and sour cherry. To that end, enzymatically released flavour compounds from hop and sour cherry glycosides were examined and a characterization of the glycoside hydrolase activity in Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces brewing yeasts was carried out, both on model substrates and onglycosides from hops and cherry. Hop and sour cherry glycoside extracts were obtained by solid-phase extraction (SPE). Enzymatic hydrolysis of the hop glycoside extract released well-known (e. g. linalool) and less typical (e. g. methyl salicylate) hop volatiles. Dihydroedulan I & II and theaspiranes A & B levels increased after enzymatic hydrolysis and were identified {{for the first time in}} hops and in beer. After enzymatic hydrolysis of the sour cherry glycoside extract, important cherry flavour contributors like benzaldehyde, linalool and eugenol were released. The compounds cis- and trans-isoeugenol and αionol were identified for the first time in sour cherry. To examine the glycoside hydrolase activity in yeast, different screening methods were tested on 41 Saccharomyces and 18 Brettanomyces yeasts. The studied Saccharomyces yeasts did not show 1, 4 -β-glucosidase activity, but a strain dependent exo- 1, 3 -β-glucanase activity was found which is responsible for a limited glycoside hydrolysis. Among Brettanomyces species with 1, 4 -β-glucosidase activity, the most pronounced 1, 4 -β-glucosidase activity was found in Brettanomyces custersii LD 72. Fermentations with this strain as pure culture or as co-culture with S. cerevisiae led to the highest release of flavour compounds from hop glycosides. Hence, the glycoside hydrolase activity of Brettanomyces custersii LD 72 was further characterized. The 1, 4 -β-glucosidase activity was found to be mainly cellassociated and localized for the most part in the cell wall and cytosolfractions. The extracellular fraction consisted mainly of an exo- 1, 3 -β-glucanase activity. Besides β-glucosidase and exo- 1, 3 -β-glucanase activities, a β-xylosidase activity was found. The requirement of Brettanomyces species in the production of lambic and gueuze beer is already well-known. Refermentation of sour cherry supplemented beer by Brettanomyces custersii led to higher concentrations, compared to refermentation by S. cerevisiae, of important cherryflavour contributors like benzaldehyde, benzyl alcohol, eugenol and linalool. From these results, it seems that Brettanomyces species may play a crucial role in the flavour development of fruit lambic beers like Kriek. Finally, the influence of the glycoside hydrolase activity was examinedon hop glycosides extracted during a dry hopping process. Treatment of the dry hopped beers with an enzyme preparation with glycosidase activities led to the highest increase of volatiles like cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, methyl salicylate, α-terpineol and theaspirane B. Among different yeast treatments, Brettanomyces custersii led to the highest hydrolase activity on a synthetic substrate, but release of glycosidically bound hop volatiles was less pronounced. However, theaspirane B was always found in higher concentrations. Additional researchis required to determine the impact of theaspiranes on the overall flavour. At higher <b>dry</b> <b>hopping</b> ratios (15. 0 g/l), an increase in the levels of the aglycones cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and αterpineol was also observed after treatment with B. custersii. Further, an unknown enzyme activity was noticed in Brettanomyces, especially in B. custersii, catalyzing the transformation of β-ionone to yet undetected compounds. In conclusion, this work provides new insights into the glycoside hydrolase activities of Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces brewing yeasts on glycosidically bound flavour compounds from hops and sour cherry. The acquired knowledge can be applied in methods to exploit the flavour potential of raw materials more efficiently, especially during fermentation and refermentation, to obtain beverages with an improved and refined flavour and to create new types of beverages. nrpages: 177 status: publishe...|$|E
