Only one week before his death, he was honored in the scientific name of a newly described species of legless lizard, Anniella stebbinsi. His collected <b>field</b> <b>notes,</b> comprising over 35 bound volumes, are archived in the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology.|$|E
5|$|Suillus americanus {{was first}} {{described}} scientifically by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck in 1888, based on specimens he had originally collected {{as far back}} as 1869, in New York state, near Sand Lake, Albany, and Port Jefferson. In his 1888 publication he indicated that he had originally listed these collections as Boletus flavidus (now known as Suillus flavidus) in his 1869 Report of the State Botanist (published in 1872). However, as was pointed out nearly a century later in 1986, the 1869 report does not actually mention the species; rather, Peck's <b>field</b> <b>notes</b> that year (which served {{as the basis for the}} report) reference a collection at Sand Lake upon which the original (1888) description was most likely based. Because Peck failed to designate a type specimen, one of the Sand Lake specimens was lectotypified in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Alfred P. Maudslay visited Iximche in 1887 and {{referred}} to it both as Patinamit and Iximche. He carried out a site survey and published a plan of the ruins. Robert Wauchope carried out a ceramic study of Iximche in the 1940s {{on behalf of the}} Middle American Research Institute of Tulane University and published his work in 19481949. Historian Janos de Szecsy began excavations at the ruins in January 1956. The remains of the city were excavated by Swiss-Guatemalan archaeologist George (Jorge) Guillemín from 1959-1972. Guillemín published his work in 1959, 1967 and 1969. The excavation and restoration of the ruins was funded by the Guatemalan Committee for Reconstruction of National Monuments until July 1961, after 1963 the investigations were funded by the Swiss National Foundation for Scientific Research. Guillemín died before his investigations could be completed and his full report published. His <b>field</b> <b>notes</b> were finally published in 2003.|$|E

This <b>field</b> <b>note</b> is a “how-to ” based on experience in the field of KMb practice and places that experience in the context of academic literature. The article concludes that KMb is not a single event or process but a system, a suite of services working together to support the multidirectional connection of researchers with decision-makers. The six KMb services comprising the KMb system are informed by four broad KMb methods: producer push, user pull, knowledge exchange, and co-production. Examples of each service are provided along with key observations that allow others interested in developing institutional KMb support services to implement these services in their own context. The <b>field</b> <b>note</b> concludes with clear recommendations for individuals and organizations interested in developing their own system of KMb services...|$|R

25|$|Audubon's {{influence}} on ornithology and natural history was far reaching. Nearly all later ornithological works {{were inspired by}} his artistry and high standards.
