50|$|Anderson was {{a member}} of the {{dominant}} True Whig Party and was elected to Liberia's House of Representatives in 1869. He became speaker of the house following the inauguration of Edward James Roye in 1870. Roye commissioned Anderson to pioneer a more direct route to Moussodougou (in modern Burkina Faso) than that which had been previously used by explorer and politician Benjamin Anderson. Benjamin Anderson, who was then secretary of the treasury, was partly responsible for planning the venture. William Spencer Anderson left Monrovia during the <b>House's</b> <b>recess</b> in May 1870 with a supply of trade goods, a number of ports and an armed escort.|$|R
5000|$|On some occasions, {{under these}} conditions, each house {{has chosen to}} meet only on every third day during the period {{spanning}} the election (and sometimes throughout the post-election period as well, until sine die adjournment). In addition, {{it is not necessary}} that either house transact any business during these intermittent meetings. If, during a given day's session, no business is transacted, it becomes a pro forma session, meaning one held only [...] "for the sake of formality." [...] In this case, the formality being satisfied is the constitutional requirement that neither <b>house</b> <b>recess</b> for more than three days if the other has not consented to a recess.|$|R
50|$|The porch on {{the eastern}} facade <b>houses</b> a <b>recessed</b> porch and {{the walls of the}} porch have been smooth {{rendered}} and scribed with ashlar stonework joints. The double entrance door of timber is surmounted by a semi-circular fan light of leadlight depicting the rising sun and cross.|$|R
50|$|It {{was last}} rebuilt in 367 AD and was thus the last {{functioning}} pagan shrine in the Forum (such shrines had been forbidden by law {{more than a}} decade earlier). The Portico <b>housed</b> twelve <b>recessed</b> rooms where it is believed the judicial clerks of the Capitoline Assent held their offices.|$|R
50|$|On June 22, 2016, House Democrats, led by Lewis and Massachusetts Representative Katherine Clark, began {{a sit-in}} {{demanding}} House Speaker Paul Ryan allow {{a vote on}} gun-safety legislation {{in the aftermath of}} the Pulse nightclub shooting. Speaker pro tempore Daniel Webster ordered the <b>House</b> into <b>recess,</b> but Democrats refused to leave the chamber for nearly 26 hours.|$|R
50|$|The {{origin of}} the word cigarral is uncertain. The most {{frequent}} version is the usual presence of cicadas (cigarras) in the summer months, which were the main use of these residences. There are other versions that relate the {{origin of the}} word to the conjunction of two Arabic words that refer to the <b>house</b> of <b>recess.</b>|$|R
50|$|On May 8, 1996, Egolf {{introduced}} HB 2604 in the House {{that would}} ban same-sex marriages {{and refuse to}} recognize marriages performed in other states. The bill bypassed the House Judiciary Committee {{in the hopes of}} speeding its passage before the next election. On June 28, the House considered a bill to amend Pennsylvania's Domestic Relations Act to allow for grandparents to adopt grandchildren over the objections of their parents. Representative Egolf introduced an amendment to this bill that paralleled his anti-marriage bill. The Republican-controlled House voted to add this anti-marriage amendment to the adoption bill. The vote on the amendment was 177-16. The bill, which had already passed the State Senate, was sent back for a concurrence vote. After this vote, the <b>House</b> <b>recessed</b> for the summer. On October 1, the Republican-controlled Senate voted 43-5 to concur with the anti-marriage language added by the House. Governor Ridge signed the act into law on October 8.|$|R

The rear sight, mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation, has an open notch used to fire up to 100 m and three apertures used for: 200, 300 and 400 m. The receiver <b>housing</b> has <b>recesses</b> that work with HK clamp adapters used to mount day or night optics.|$|R
50|$|The sit-in, {{which was}} quickly {{organized}} and caught House Republicans off-guard, {{resulted in the}} Speaker pro tempore, Dan Webster, ordering the <b>House</b> into <b>recess,</b> with the cameras which provide video coverage of the chamber's daily proceedings to news networks including C-SPAN consequently shut off. Democrats refused to leave the floor during this recess and instead gave speeches, streamed online to over a million individuals via Periscope and Facebook, demanding Congressional action to combat gun violence.|$|R
50|$|The G41 has {{mechanically}} adjustable iron sights with a rear rotating diopter {{drum and}} hooded front post. The rear sight drum has three apertures of different diameter calibrated for firing at distances of 200, 300 and 400 m and a triangular notch setting preset for firing at 100 m. The receiver <b>housing</b> has <b>recesses</b> {{in the top}} cover that {{permit the use of}} H&K's proprietary clamp mounts and adapters for NATO-standard optics (such as the Hensoldt 4×24 telescopic sight).|$|R
5000|$|Fronting {{the loading}} yard to Macalister Street, the main {{building}} is a rectangular concrete shed distinguished by decorative stepped parapets which screen a gable roof clad with corrugated metal sheeting. The north-west elevation is divided into seven bays each <b>housing</b> <b>recessed</b> blind panels to the upper level and openings within the recessed panels to the exterior loading dock. Two dock level bays accommodate nine-light casement windows and the balance have either large timber doors or fixed timber panels. The decorative stepped parapet to this elevation contains the lettering [...] "The South Burnett Co-operative Dairy Association Ltd" [...] framed by moulded decorative scrolls to each side. The north-east elevation {{is divided into three}} bays, one of which has a large timber door opening onto the dock which extends through the space joining {{the main building}} and the earlier Tiaro building. This elevation is distinguished by a glazed semi-circular window within the stepped parapet. The south-west elevation has three blind bays and a blind semi-circular window within the parapet.

Encircling it are wide verandahs on all sides, with an infill section of the south east. This building is constructed of vertical slabs of timber <b>housed</b> in <b>recessed</b> timber sections {{at the top and}} base of the wall, and the building features a similar double roof system to that previously described. The verandah is supported on chamfered timber posts.|$|R
50|$|The Abramson House is a {{historic}} house at 127 Crescent Heights in Holly Grove, Arkansas. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with brick veneer walls and a green tile roof. Designed by Memphis, Tennessee architect Estes Mann and built in 1921-22, it is a particularly fine local example of Craftsman style architecture. It is an L-shaped structure, with arched openings (one <b>housing</b> a <b>recessed</b> porch, the other an enclosed former porch) {{at the ends of}} one leg, and half-timbered stucco projecting sections with oriel windows.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has arcaded verandahs to both street frontages, consisting of five bays to Lake Street and three to Spence Street, with large rounded fabric awnings attached. There is a shallow ogee shaped central gable to Lake Street, which originally surmounted the entry but now <b>houses</b> a <b>recessed</b> window, {{with the words}} THE ADELAIDE STEAMSHIP CO LTD in relief and a sculpture {{of one of their}} vessels above. Sections of concave solid balustrade have been removed to provide access to a relocated corner entry, and end bays have timber framed casement windows.|$|R
50|$|Republicans first {{attempted}} to reclaim control of House proceedings {{at noon on}} June 22, sending Texas congressman Ted Poe (R-Texas) to act as Speaker pro tempore of the House. The Democrats {{attempted to}} convene the session at noon, but following the chaplain's prayer and the Pledge of Allegiance, the protesting Representatives refused to come to order. Poe then declared the <b>House</b> in <b>recess.</b> He successfully gaveled the House into order, but was easily drowned out by Democratic members, and he again <b>recessed</b> the <b>House</b> without any legislative action having been taken.|$|R
50|$|The {{pneumatically}} actuated inwards retracting undercarriage {{was housed}} inside the inner lower-wing which folded at approx ½ span {{to lie in}} recesses in {{the sides of the}} fuselage. The outer halves of the lower wings remained horizontal as the wings retracted and were <b>housed</b> in <b>recesses</b> in the under-surfaces of the upper wings. Retraction of the wings was carried out by a single vertically mounted pneumatic actuator in the fuselage which unlocked the bracing struts either side and pulled the wing upwards as the bracing strut was pulled upwards.|$|R
50|$|The arched window {{openings}} which {{line the}} north and south walls of the church are <b>housed</b> in arched <b>recesses,</b> in the spandrels of which sit the corbelled supports of the timber ceiling joists. The windows are glazed with diamond mullioned glass in varying shades of blue and green forming geometric patterns.|$|R
50|$|The {{ground floor}} {{elevation}} has a centrally located doorway housed in an arched recess flanked by pairs of rectangular windows <b>housed</b> in rectangular <b>recesses.</b> The window openings are fitted with double hung casements.

5000|$|Between 2001 and 2004, Roberto Mangú {{moved to}} a place near Toulouse where his art is once more deeply renewed. Inspired by the landscapes and a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, he {{develops}} new series including <b>houses</b> drawn in <b>recess</b> or pathways that seem to burst the painting (Camino de Santiago, Via Natura, Les Blés à la Cadiscié) ...|$|R
50|$|The Arlington Post Office {{is set on}} {{the west}} side of Court Street, a narrow side street just north of Massachusetts Avenue in Arlington Center. It is a single story brick Colonial Revival building, with a hip roof topped by an {{octagonal}} cupola. The central section of the building projects slightly, with three round-arch bays. The central bay is lined with limestone trim, and <b>houses</b> the <b>recessed</b> entrance. A gable roof section has been added to the roof above the entrance to divert rainwater. The building as a whole is a slightly larger version of buildings the Postal Service was building for smaller communities at the time.|$|R
25|$|The breccia marble {{paneling}} and altar also display botanical, zoologic, anthropomorphic, geometric and allegoric motifs. This {{was executed}} by the master masons Manuel Antunes and João Teixeira and completed in 1690. The side <b>recesses</b> <b>house</b> reliquaries {{from the collection of}} D. João de Borja. The sculpture inside the glass case beneath the altar is of “Christ in Death”and dates from the 18th century.|$|R

50|$|Martin {{was in the}} Speaker's chair {{presiding}} over the House on March 1, 1954 when four Puerto Rican independence activists opened fire on the House, wounding five Congressmen. Speaker Martin declared the <b>House</b> in <b>recess</b> as he sought cover behind a marble pillar on the rostrum. Martin {{would be the last}} Republican to serve as Speaker of the House until the election of Newt Gingrich of Georgia {{in the aftermath of the}} Republican Revolution almost forty years later. Martin remained leader of the House Republicans until 1958, when the party experienced heavy losses in that year's elections. In the aftermath, Martin was ousted from the leadership by his deputy, Charles A. Halleck.|$|R
5000|$|The Speaker {{performs}} various procedural functions. He or she {{may recall}} the <b>House</b> from <b>recess</b> during a national emergency, or when otherwise requested by the Government. When vacancies arise, the Speaker authorises the issuance of writs of election. Furthermore, the Speaker is responsible for certifying bills that relate solely to national taxation as [...] "money bills" [...] under the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949. The House of Lords has no power to block or substantially delay a money bill; even if the Lords fail to pass the bill, it becomes law within a month of passage by the Commons. The Speaker's decision on the matter is final, and cannot be challenged by the Upper House.|$|R
50|$|The D.V.Adams Co.-Bussell and Weston Building {{is located}} {{on the west side of}} Water Street, Augusta's {{principal}} business thoroughfare, on the block south of Bridge Street. It is a three-story brick structure, with a flat roof adorned by an ornate projecting cornice.

The central bay is wider than the others, <b>housing</b> the <b>recessed</b> building entrance on the ground floor, and three-part windows on the upper floors with slender pilasters dividing the sections. The interior retains original decorative features, including iron columns, a wooden staircase, and pressed metal ceilings.|$|R
50|$|The {{main entry}} {{is located at}} the {{southeast}} facet of the house. Unusually for an octagon <b>house,</b> it is <b>recessed</b> to create a porch, extending outside of the house, overlooking the Hudson River roughly a mile to the east. A two-story rectangular kitchen wing projects from the west facet, with a sympathetic contemporary octagonal hip-roofed porch wing attached to it. The remains of an earlier porch project from the east facet.|$|R
50|$|Various {{forms of}} Ramsbottom valve were produced. Some were {{separate}} fittings to the boiler, through separate penetrations. Others were {{contained in a}} U-shaped housing fastened to a single opening in the boiler shell. As boiler diameter increased, some forms were even set inside the boiler shell, with the springs <b>housed</b> in a <b>recess</b> inside and only the valves and balance lever protruding outside. These had obvious drawbacks for easy maintenance.|$|R
60|$|London was empty. The fashionable {{streets were}} {{actually}} without a soul, for {{minutes at a}} time; and, without seeing it, I could not have believed that a town which, at certain times, is so crowded as actually to render crossing its streets hazardous, was ever so like a mere wilderness of <b>houses.</b> During these <b>recesses</b> in dissipation and fashion, I believe that the meanest residents disappear for a few months.|$|R
60|$|Then, {{the small}} {{people could not}} be disabused {{of the idea that}} certain chief treasures of their own would be safer under papa's writing-table or mamma's sofa than in the safest closet of their domains. My writing-table was {{dockyard}} for Arthur's new ship, and stable for little Tom's pepper-and-salt-colored pony, and carriage-house for Charley's new wagon, while whole armies of paper dolls kept <b>house</b> in the <b>recess</b> behind mamma's sofa.|$|R
2500|$|... which {{matches the}} details {{on the front porch}} with wooden posts and a {{spindled}} handrail. There are small brackets under the eave and lattice [...] covers the area under the porch. The porch is accessed from the two 6/9 sash windows from the front and back room, which reach to the floor. Above these openings are two 6/9 sash windows on the second floor and lozenge windows at the third floor. The right side of the <b>house</b> is <b>recessed</b> back for the rear ell which has a two-story porch. The porches were enclosed in the 1940s with glass windows, and were updated in 2010 with 4/4 casement windows and transoms and brick stairs. The wooden floor [...] remains in its original condition.|$|R
