5000|$|The engine's {{torque and}} {{acceleration}} were increased by {{the introduction of}} the new fuel-injected system, with dual throttle valve and auto <b>fast-idle</b> systems.

50|$|The DL650 engine {{electronics}} aid {{starting and}} throttle control and uses Suzuki's AFIS (Auto Fast Idle System), eliminating a <b>fast-idle</b> control. The {{engine control module}} (ECM) reads engine information, such as coolant temperature, via a 32-bit central processing unit (CPU), controlling the fuel system's dual throttle bodies.|$|E
5000|$|Fuel {{enrichment}} during cold-start {{is achieved}} by altering {{the timing of the}} main injectors based on engine temperature, no [...] "cold start" [...] injector is required. The idle speed is also fully controlled by the Motronic unit, including <b>fast-idle</b> during warm-up (therefore no thermo-time switch is required).|$|E
5000|$|The 2001 model {{carried over}} to 2002 with minimal changes. 2002 {{introduced}} i.a. {{modifications to the}} fuel pump, clutch, front axle, torque link, mirrors, and luggage hooks. The manual <b>fast-idle</b> was replaced with a computer operated implementation (the [...] "STV servo"). New colours, and new GSXR stickers.|$|E
50|$|The ML 2.1 system {{integrates}} {{an advanced}} engine management with 2 knock sensors provision for adaptive fuel & timing adjustment, purge canister control, precision sequential fuel control & diagnostics (pre OBD-1). Fuel enrichment during cold-start {{is achieved by}} altering {{the timing of the}} main injectors based on engine temperature. The idle speed is also fully controlled by the digital Motronic unit, including <b>fast-idle</b> during warm-up. Updated variants ML 2.10.1 thru 2.5 add MAF Mass Air Flow sensor logic and direct fire ignition coils per cylinder. Motronic 2.1 is used in the Porsche 4 cyl 16V 944S/S2/968 and the 6 cyl Boxer Carrera 964 & 993, Opel/Vauxhall, FIAT & Alfa Romeo engines.|$|E
40|$|As the CO 2 {{emission}} standards {{around the world}} become more stringent, the turbocharged downsized gasoline direct injection (GDI) engine provides a mature platform to achieve better fuel economy. For this reason, {{it is expected that}} the GDI engine will capture increasing shares of the market during the coming years. The in-cylinder liquid injection, though advantageous in most engine operation regimes, creates emissions challenges during the cold crank-start and cold <b>fast-idle</b> phases. The engine cold-start is responsible for a disproportionate share of the hydrocarbons (HC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM) emitted over the certification cycle. Understanding the sources of the pollutants during this stage is necessary for the further market penetration of GDI under the constraint of tighter {{emission standards}}. This work aims to examine the formation processes of the HC, NOx and PM emissions during the cold-start phase in a GDI engine, and the sensitivity of the pollutant emissions to different operation strategies. To this end, a detailed analysis of the crank-start was carried out, in which the first three engine cycles were individually examined. For the steady-state phase, the trade-off between low <b>fast-idle</b> emissions and high exhaust thermal enthalpy flow, necessary for fast catalyst warm-up, is investigated under several operation strategies. The pollutant formation processes are strongly dependent on the mixture formation and on the temperature and pressure history of the combustion process. The results show that unconventional valve timing strategies with large, symmetric, negative valve overlap and delayed combustion phasing are the most effective ways to reduce engine-out emissions during both crank-start and <b>fast-idle</b> phases. by Juan Felipe Rodríguez.

40|$|A single {{cylinder}} of an automotive V- 8 engine was fitted with an electronically timed {{system for the}} pulsed injection of secondary air. A straight-tube exhaust minimized any mixing other than that produced by secondary-air pulsing. The device was operated over a range of engine loads and speeds. Effects attributable to secondary-air pulsing were found, but emission levels were generally no better than using the engine's own injection system. Under nontypical <b>fast-idle,</b> no-load conditions, emission levels were reduced by roughly a factor of 2...|$|E
40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the effect of}} valve timing during cold crank-start and cold <b>fast-idle</b> (1200 rpm, 2 bar NIMEP) on the emissions of hydrocarbons (HC) and particulate mass and number (PM/PN). Four different cam-phaser configurations are studied in detail: 1. Baseline stock valve timing. 2. Late intake opening/closing. 3. Early exhaust opening/closing. 4. Late intake phasing combined with early exhaust phasing. Delaying the intake valve opening improves the mixture formation process and results in more than 25 % reduction of the HC and of the PM/PN emissions during cold crank-start. Early exhaust valve phasing results in a deterioration of the HC and PM/PN emissions performance during cold crank-start. Nevertheless, early exhaust valve phasing slightly improves the HC emissions and substantially reduces the particulate emissions at cold <b>fast-idle.</b> The combined strategy consisting of late intake and early exhaust phasing shows a considerable reduction in both the cold crank-start HC and PM/PN emissions of 30 %. In fast idle, the HC and PM emissions respond differently to the different valve timing strategy. The combined late IVO and early EVC configuration with moderate combustion phasing retard gives the best HC and PM emissions and reasonable engine stability.

40|$|The NOx {{emissions}} {{during the}} crank-start and cold <b>fast-idle</b> phases of a GDI engine are analyzed in detail. The NOx emissions {{of the first}} 3 firing cycles are studied under a wide set of parameters including the mass of fuel injected, start of injection, and ignition timing. The results show a strong dependence of the NOx emissions with injection timing; they are significantly reduced as the mixture is stratified. The impact of different valve timings on crank-start NOx emissions was analyzed. Late intake and early exhaust timings show similar potential for NOx reduction; 26 - 30 % lower than the baseline. The combined strategy, resulting in a large symmetric negative valve overlap, shows the greatest reduction; 59 % lower than the baseline. The cold <b>fast-idle</b> NOx emissions were studied under different equivalence ratios, injection strategies, combustion phasing, and valve timings. Slightly lean air-fuel mixtures result in a significant reduction of NOx. The engine-out emissions are highly sensitivity to combustion phasing. Initial retard results in lower mass NOx emissions up to CA 50 around 40 °CA aTDC-compression. After this point the increase in fuel consumption and the reduction on residual fraction reverse the trend leading {{to an increase in}} NOx mass emissions for later combustion phasing. Moderate exhaust timing advance is beneficial for NOx emissions and has no impact on the exhaust enthalpy flow. Engine and Fuels Research Consortiu...|$|E
40|$|To better {{understand}} the role that turbulence plays in causing cycle-by-cycle variations, an experimental study {{was carried out in}} which charge motion or laminar flame speed was varied. Two sets of tests were done. The first consisted of using an air jet mounted in the intake port to generate charge motion at a spark-timing sweep from 20 ⁰ BTC to 200 ATC. Two jet orientations were tested with the intent of generating swirl and tumble. Also done over this spark-timing sweep, the second set of tests consisted of replacing the nitrogen in air with a diluent, argon or carbon dioxide, to increase or decrease, the laminar flame speed. Tests were conducted at <b>fast-idle</b> conditions. These were 2. 6 bar NIMEP, 1400 rpm, 20 ⁰C average coolant temperature, and relative air-fuel ratio set to 1. 00. In-cylinder pressure measurements yielded COV of NIMEP and burn duration. Exhaust temperature was also recorded. The swirl jet improved COV of NIMEP a maximum of approximately 30 % at each spark timing tested. The tumble jet improved COV a maximum of 10 % to 44 % depending on the spark timing. No jet flow increased or decreased exhaust temperature more than approximately 5 %. Strong correlation was found between exhaust temperature and combustion phasing. The turbulence test data showed a correlation between exhaust temperature and COV as well as between COV and combustion phasing. However, the change in laminar flame speed data showed a weaker correlation in both. by Craig B. E. Wildman. Thesis (S. M.)
