5|$|Any dive {{which is}} started while the tissues retain {{residual}} inert gas {{in excess of}} the surface <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.|$|E

25|$|The {{essential}} element of this automatic system is a lever arm attached to a mass in the centre-fuselage, which is connected with the pitch controls. The moment generated by the mass is arranged to reach an <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> with the pitch control forces at each flight condition, with the flaps moving to a high lift coefficient position at low speeds or {{when there is a}} high pitch control load, and vice versa, maintaining the optimum angle of attack for the aerofoil. The automatic system on the Mü28 is identical in operation with the aircraft inverted, due to the use of a symmetrical section aerofoil set at zero degrees incidence, with the automatic system only turned off for takeoff and landing, and over-ridden manually as desired by the pilot.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{inefficiency}} in the MC market structure. First, at its optimum output the firm charges {{a price that}} exceeds marginal costs, The MC firm maximizes profits where marginal revenue = marginal cost. Since the MC firm's demand curve is downward sloping {{this means that the}} firm will be charging a price that exceeds marginal costs. The monopoly power possessed by a MC firm means that at its profit maximizing level of production there will be a net loss of consumer (and producer) surplus. The second source of inefficiency is the fact that MC firms operate with excess capacity. That is, the MC firm's profit maximizing output is less than the output associated with minimum average cost. Both a PC and MC firm will operate at a point where demand or price equals average cost. For a PC firm this <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> occurs where the perfectly elastic demand curve equals minimum average cost. A MC firm’s demand curve is not flat but is downward sloping. Thus in the long run the demand curve will be tangential to the long run average cost curve at a point to the left of its minimum. The result is excess capacity.|$|E

The <b>equilibrium</b> <b>conditions</b> {{can be reduced}} to six equations in six unknowns, plus the existence of integrals of motion consisting of the total angular momentum and energy of the system.

2500|$|When the {{buoyancy}} compensator of a scuba diver is inflated at {{the surface}} to provide positive buoyancy, {{the positions of the}} centre of buoyancy and centre of gravity of the diver are generally different. The vertical and horizontal separation of these centroids will determine the static trim of the diver {{at the surface}}. The diver can usually overcome the trimming moment of buoyancy, but this requires constant directed effort, albeit usually not a great deal of effort. This allows a conscious [...] diver to adjust trim to suit the circumstances such as the choice between swimming face down or face up, or remaining vertical for best field of view or visibility. The position of the diver's centre of gravity is determined by the distribution of weight, and buoyancy is determined by the equipment in use, particularly the buoyancy compensator, which can significantly influence centre of buoyancy shifts as it is inflated and deflated. Stable trim implies that the centre of buoyancy is directly above the centre of gravity. Any horizontal offset will generate a moment which will rotate the diver until the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>condition</b> is restored.|$|E
