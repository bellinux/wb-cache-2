40|$|Summary: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of clopidogrel on adenosine diphosphate (ADP) -induced platelet activation in human volunteers. Platelets from human volunteers before and after a 7 -day treatment with clopidogrel (75 mg/kg), were tested for their sensi-tivity to ADP by measuring ADP-induced aggregation, adenylyl cyclase downregulation, and [3 H]- 2 -MeS-ADP binding. Platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP IIb-IIIa; GP Ib, GMP- 140) expression was measured by flow cy-tometry using fluorescent-labeled antibodies or fibrino-gen. After oral administration to human volunteers (75 mg/day for 7 days), clopidogrel, a novel ADP-selective antiplatelet agent, inhibited ADP-induced aggregation of platelets ex vivo.

The <b>irreversible</b> <b>nature</b> of measurement operations in quantum physics is sometimes referred to as the measurement problem and is described mathematically by quantum operations.

Contrary to Tyr-recombinases, {{the four}} {{participating}} DNA-strands are cut in synchrony at points staggered by only 2 bp (leaving {{little room for}} proofreading). Subunit-rotation (180°) permits the exchange of strands while covalently linked to the protein partner. The intermediate exposure of double-strand breaks bears risks of triggering illegitimate recombination and thereby secondary reactions.Here, the synaptic complex arises from the association of pre-formed recombinase dimers with the respective target sites (CTD/NTD, C-/N-terminal domain). Like for Tyr-recombinases, each site contains two arms, each accommodating one protomer. As both arms are structured slightly differently, the subunits become conformationally tuned and thereby prepared for their respective role in the recombination cycle. Contrary {{to members of the}} Tyr-class the recombination pathway converts two different substrate sites (attP and attB) to site-hybrids (attL and attR). This explains the <b>irreversible</b> <b>nature</b> of this particular recombination pathway, which can only be overcome by auxiliary [...] "recombination directionality factors" [...] (RDFs).|$|E
50|$|The drugs {{bound to}} the {{catalytic}} site are often metabolized to intermediates which have much higher affinity for the androgen receptor. The binding of the intermediate metabolite 17-hydroexemestane for the androgen receptor is about 100 {{times that of the}} parent compound, exemestane. When the metabolite attaches to the active site on the enzyme, the enzyme initiates its typical sequence of hydroxylation, but hydroxylation produces an unbreakable covalent bond between the inhibitor and the enzyme protein. Even if all unattached parts of the inhibitor are removed, the enzyme activity of the aromatase can only be restored by new enzyme synthesis. The inhibitor thereby blocks the activity of the enzyme even after the drug is cleared from circulation, thus having a lasting effect in vivo. There is no need for continued presence of the drug to maintain inhibition, which in turn reduced the chance of toxic adverse effects to the patient. Due to the <b>irreversible</b> <b>nature</b> of the inhibition, the steroidal AIs are often marketed as inactivators or suicide inhibitors.|$|E

We observed that gene induction caused an approximate 60 min periodicity of several transcription related processes: first, the covalent histone modifications and presence of many regulatory proteins at the transcription start site; second, RNA polymerase II activity; third, chromatin loop formation; and fourth, mRNA accumulation. Our model can predict the precise timing of single-gene activity leading to transcriptional cycling on the cell population level when we take into account the sequential and <b>irreversible</b> multistep <b>nature</b> of transcriptional initiation.
