50|$|Glucocorticosteroids (GCS) are {{anti-inflammatory}} steroids that inhibit both {{central and}} peripheral cytokine synthesis and action. In {{a study conducted}} by Kalipada Pahan from the Department of Pediatrics at the Medical University of South Carolina, both lovastatin and sodium phenylacetate were found to inhibit TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in rat microglia. This shows that the mevalonate pathway plays a role in controlling the expression of cytokines in microglia and may be important in developing drugs to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Naltrexone may provide a solution to the inflammatory mediators produced by microglia. Although naltrexone's main action is to competitively bind to opioid receptors, new research shows that naltrexone, when given in low doses once per day (low-dose naltrexone), can inhibit cytokine synthesis by microglia cells. This mechanism is still being investigated, but there are already studies that indicate that it helps some patients suffering from <b>fibromyalgia</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Naltrexone shows more promise than GCSs because the GCSs inhibit immune system function more generally, increase allergic reactions and, as the name implies, increase blood glucose levels.|$|E

5000|$|Affective {{disorders}} {{are characterized by}} a frequent, fluctuating alteration in mood, affecting the patient’s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Affective disorders include depression, anxiety, and bi-polar disorder. A number of approaches have been utilized to study the role that neurokinin A plays in the manifestation and continuation of human affective disorders. The measurement of serum peptide levels in depressed patients as well as anxious patients displayed higher plasma levels of tachykinins than their low anxiety counterparts. In addition to studies of plasma levels of TKs, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of neurokinin A have also been directly correlated with depression. Under states of depression neurokinin immunoreactivity is increased in the frontal cortex, and decreased in the striatum, these peptide levels were {{not found to be}} treatable by lithium treatment in mice. [...] Elevated levels of tachykinins in CSF have been found in patients with <b>fibromyalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> which is a disorder that is strongly correlated with depression in human patients. Tachykinin ligands have been extensively studies and determined to be functionally linked to the control of affective phenotypes in a complex physiological manner.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Fibromyalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{a chronic}} {{widespread}} pain condition. Other symptoms often can be found, such as fatigue, lack of sleep, irritable bowel syndrome, and mood disturbance. In addition, depression is a clinically relevant symptom that {{commonly found in}} <b>fibromyalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor {{has been known to}} play a role in <b>fibromyalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients. Additionally, brain derived neurotrophic factor is related to depression. However, the role of this neurotrophin and depression in <b>fibromyalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients needs to be elucidated. Exercise is one of recommended treatment modalities for <b>fibromyalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients which may influence the level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Thus, this review summarize the available data on the correlation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor with depression in <b>fibromyalgia</b> <b>syndrome</b> patients and the knowledge about influences of exercise on brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels...|$|E
