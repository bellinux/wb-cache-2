5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, solute concentration, and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the <b>energy</b> <b>capability</b> before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E

40|$|Modern power DMOS {{transistors}} greatly {{benefit from}} the continuous advances of the technology, which yield devices with very low area-specific RDS,on figures of merit and therefore allow for significantly reduced active areas. However, in many applications, where the devices must dissipate high amounts of energy and thus are subjected to significant self-heating, the active area is not dictated by RDS,on requirements, but by the energy constraints. In this paper, a simple method of improving the <b>energy</b> <b>capability</b> and reliability of power DMOS transistors operating in pulsed conditions is proposed and experimentally verified. The method consists in redistributing the power density from the hotter to the cooler device regions, hence achieving a more homogeneous temperature distribution and a reduced peak temperature.
