5|$|A {{dominant}} male black wildebeest {{will have}} a harem of females and will not allow other males to mate with them. The breeding season occurs {{at the end of}} the rainy season and lasts a few weeks between February and April. When one of his females comes into oestrus the male concentrates on her and mates with <b>her</b> <b>several</b> times. Sexual behaviour by the male at this time includes stretching low, ears down, sniffing of the female's vulva, performing ritual urination and touching his chin to the female's rump. At the same time, the female keeps her tail upwards (sometimes vertically) or swishes it across the face of the male. The pair usually separates after copulation, but the female occasionally follows her mate afterwards, touching his rump with her snout. During the breeding season, the male loses condition as he spends little time grazing. Males are known to mount other males.|$|E

5|$|Bobcats {{generally}} begin breeding {{by their}} second summer, though females may start {{as early as}} their first year. Sperm production begins each year by September or October, and the male is fertile into the summer. A dominant male travels with a female and mates with <b>her</b> <b>several</b> times, generally from winter until early spring; this varies by location, but most mating takes place during February and March. The pair may undertake {{a number of different}} behaviors, including bumping, chasing, and ambushing. Other males may be in attendance, but remain uninvolved. Once the male recognizes the female is receptive, he grasps her in the typical felid neck grip and mates with her. The female may later go on to mate with other males, and males generally mate with several females. During courtship, the otherwise silent bobcat may let out loud screams, hisses, or other sounds. Research in Texas has suggested establishing a home range is necessary for breeding; studied animals with no set range had no identified offspring. The female has an estrous cycle of 44 days, with the estrus lasting five to ten days. Bobcats remain reproductively active throughout their lives.|$|E

5|$|Imperatritsa Mariya, {{named after}} Tsarina Maria Feodorovna, mother of Tsar Nicholas II, {{was built by}} the Russud Shipyard at Nikolayev, Russian Empire. She was laid down on 30 October 1911 along with her sister ships Imperator Aleksander III and Imperatritsa Ekaterina Velikaya, but this was merely a {{ceremonial}} event as the design {{had not yet been}} finalized nor the contract signed.

On 1 October she provided cover for the Black Sea Fleet's pre-dreadnoughts as they bombarded targets in Kozlu, Zonguldak and Karadeniz Ereğli. She did much the same when older battleships bombarded targets in Bulgaria on 20–22 October and then Varna itself on 27 October.

The Yavuz dodged north and avoided the Russians by paralleling the Bulgarian coastline back to the Bosphorus. The Midilli mined the harbor of Novorossiysk on 21 July, but the Russians, again alerted by radio intercepts, attempted to catch her on her return journey. Midilli was lured into range of Imperatritsa Mariyas guns the next day when the cruiser pursued the , but she managed to escape with only splinter damage.|$|E
