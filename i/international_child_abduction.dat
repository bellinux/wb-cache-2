40|$|<b>International</b> <b>child</b> abductors often escape {{domestic}} {{law enforcement and}} disappear without consequence or resolution. <b>International</b> <b>child</b> <b>abductions</b> occur too frequently; in the United States alone, {{the number of children}} abducted abroad every year has risen to over 1, 000. Currently, 11, 000 American children live abroad with their abductors. These abductions occur despite international treaties and the Congressional resolutions that have significantly stiffened the penalties for those caught. Effectively combating <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abductions</b> requires drafting resolutions that are acceptable across the diverse societies and cultures of the international community. Without such resolutions to fill the gaps of current treaties this problem will continue and the suffering endured by children being uprooted and hidden from one of their parents will continue. The rise in both international marriages and divorce rates along with increased ease of travel has correlated with the rise in <b>child</b> <b>abductions.</b> Statistics from the Missing Children’s Registry show that abductions by parents are five times greater than by strangers. The Justice Department reported that of the 358, 700 children abducted in the U. S. each year 354, 100 were abducted by one of their parents. Law enforcement agencies’ reluctance to get involved in <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abductions,</b> though understandable, is regrettable as it leaves the vast resources of these agencies off limits to left-behind parents. The cost of locating an <b>international</b> <b>child</b> abductor is very high, especially for a third world nation with strapped resources struggling to adequately combat “local murders, inner city crime and ‘real’ kidnappings. ” Finding ways to offset resource utilization and for participation of these crucial nations is necessary for more effectively combating <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abductions...</b>|$|R

25|$|Both {{in common}} law and in civil law, a rebuttable {{presumption}} (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption {{made by a}} court, one that is taken to be true unless someone comes forward to contest it and prove otherwise. For example, a defendant {{in a criminal case}} is presumed innocent until proved guilty. According to law, in an <b>International</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> the left behind parent is legally the only victim, if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights.|$|E
25|$|<b>International</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> in Japan {{refers to}} the illegal {{international}} abduction or removal of children from their country of habitual residence by an acquaintance or family member to Japan or their retention in Japan in contravention {{to the law of}} another country. Most cases involve a Japanese mother taking her children to Japan in defiance of visitation or joint custody orders issued by Western courts. The issue is a growing problem as the number of international marriages increases. Barring exceptional circumstances, the effects of child abduction are generally detrimental to the welfare of children. Parental abduction often has a particularly devastating effect on parents who may never see their children again.|$|E
25|$|The USCA {{observed}} {{the following three}} causal factors for judicial delays: (1)lack of implementing legislation or procedures for Convention applications and many Mexican judges following inapposite procedures found in state civil codes in resolving such cases; (2) {{lack of understanding of}} the Convention by many Mexican judges, as evidenced by extensive requests for information, including letters under Article 15 of the Convention from the USCA to confirm that a particular case involved an <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> as defined by the Convention; and (3) TPs absconding with the children when summoned to a hearing because they were notified of the hearing but neither they nor the children were secured in any way. The USCA has observed that a tool for securing children in the Mexican system is for the judge to place the child temporarily in a children’s protection service (Desarrollo Integral de la Familia, or DIF) shelter while the case is being processed, but judges are reluctant to place children in these shelters unless the TP is determined to be a clear danger to the child.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that because the abductor in these cases is usually not a stranger the children are not in danger. The harmful consequences {{for children and families}} have been shown in several studies [...] and <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> has been characterized as a form of parental alienation and <b>child</b> abuse. Adding <b>international</b> dimensions to the detrimental effects of <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> significantly increases the detrimental effects on children and families.

25|$|<b>International</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> {{occurs when}} one parent takes (or retains) a child before child custody ends at age 18, {{to a foreign}} country (example China, India and Japan) and keeps him or her there without the other parent’s permission. If that parent refuses to bring the child {{under the age of}} 16 back to the United States, it’s {{considered}} a federal crime in the United States. It does not matter if the child does not want to return to the United States, or if the courts in the other country (example China, India and Japan) allow the taking parent to keep the child in the other country (example China, India and Japan). The taking parent can face up to three years in United States Federal prison, even when the child is over the age of 18, does not want to ever see the left behind parent again and does not want the taking parent to face criminal charges or go to jail. According to law, the left behind parent is legally the only victim if the child is not returned before child custody ends at age 18. This is because child custody does not {{have anything to do with}} children’s rights or welfare only parental rights. This is because the courts in other country's (example China, Japan and India) do not enforce a US child custody order.|$|E
25|$|From 2003 to 2009, the United Kingdom has had 37 {{cumulative}} {{cases of}} British nationals being abducted to Japan by a parent, {{none of which}} have been resolved. For a yearly figure, The Guardian newspaper reported that, for 2008 alone, there are 336 cases and estimated 470 children were abducted from the UK and taken abroad illegally, an increase of 20% from 2005 figures. Pakistan (30 cases) top the list followed by the US (23), Ireland (22) and Spain (21). Other abduction hotspots included Australia, France and Egypt. The cases of international parental abduction are not well published in U.K. due to reporting restrictions that apply to any cases involving the welfare of minors. However, the Guardian provided anecdotal evidence. A reporter attended a day in London family court. Eight out of 14 cases heard involved child abduction, which may indicate that the problem is widespread. 40% (134 out of the 336) of international abductions in 2008 involve countries that are not signatories to the Hague Convention. These include Bangladesh, Russia, Iraq and Nigeria. Moreover, the problem is expected to worsen as immigration and international marriage become common. Moreover, The Independent newspaper cites the Reunite <b>International</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Abduction</b> Centre which claims that 43% of parental abductions involve ethnic minority children taken abroad and often forced to marry. Moreover, cultural complicity, collusion and shame mean that many cases go unreported.|$|E

Arguably, the child's habitual residence as a home environment of the nature anticipated by the Convention's drafters is an increasingly outdated construct. This is due to an increase in both the number of abducting primary-carer mothers, and their families' growing mobility. Judicial determinations of habitual residence made during Convention return proceedings are entrenched in the state centric paradigm.

2500|$|The term <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> is {{generally}} synonymous with international parental kidnapping, child snatching, and child stealing. [...] However, the more precise legal usage of <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> originates in {{private international law}} and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, [...] "illegal" [...] is normally taken to mean [...] "in breach of custodial rights" [...] and [...] "home" [...] {{is defined as the}} child's habitual residence. As implied by the [...] "breach of custodial rights," [...] the phenomenon of <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.|$|E
2500|$|Lawmakers {{struggled}} to typify and discuss <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction</b> and discussions at the Hague Conference on Private International Law noted that, what some were referring to with variations on [...] "legal kidnapping," [...] was an oxymoron since {{that which is}} legal cannot be kidnapping and that which is kidnapping cannot be legal. The response to these concerns was the coining of the term [...] "international child abduction." [...] The terms first prominent use was {{in the title of}} the 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of <b>International</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Abduction.</b> The term is not, however, used anywhere in the actual text of the convention itself in preference of the more technical terms [...] "wrongful removal" [...] or [...] "wrongful retention" [...] which were better suited for describing the mechanics of the Convention's system.

2500|$|In actual {{cases of}} <b>international</b> <b>child</b> <b>abduction,</b> {{this lack of}} a {{specific}} provision on child abduction in the 1961 treaty resulted in countries regularly interpreting the [...] "habitual residence" [...] concept of the Convention {{in a manner that}} allowed parents to take children to a foreign country and immediately acquire [...] "habitual residence."
