40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA Panel on food contact materials, enzymes, flavourings and processing aids {{deals with the}} safety evaluation {{of the mixture of}} the active substances citric acid (E 330, CAS No 77 - 92 - 9, <b>FCM</b> <b>Substance</b> <b>No</b> 139) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (E 500 ii, CAS No 144 - 55 - 8, <b>FCM</b> <b>Substance</b> <b>No</b> 21), which is intended {{to be used as a}} carbon dioxide generator in liquid absorbent pads in the packaging of fresh or frozen meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables. Depending on absorption capacity needed, pure cellulose or a mixture of cellulose and polyacrylic acid sodium salt crosslinked may be used as absorber. The Panel noted that if the active substances are used not in direct contact with food, but are placed in a pad under conditions where its absorption capacity is not exceeded, then no migration is to be expected and therefore no exposure from the consumption of the packed food is expected. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that the use of the mixture of the active substances citric acid (E 330) and sodium hydrogen carbonate (E 500 ii), as carbon dioxide generator in liquid absorbent pads in the packaging of food such as fresh or frozen meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables, does not raise a safety concern. The absorbent pads should be used only under conditions in which the liquid absorption capacity is not exceeded and direct contact between the substance and the food is excluded...|$|E

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of the acrylic acid, sodium salt, co-polymer with acrylic acid, methyl ester, methacrylic acid, 2 hydroxypropylester, and acrylic acid cross-linked (CAS No. 117675 - 55 - 5, <b>FCM</b> <b>Substance</b> <b>No</b> 1022), {{to be used as}} liquid absorber in the form of fibres in absorbent pads for the packaging of fresh or frozen meat, poultry, and fish as well as fresh fruits and vegetables. The Panel considered that migration is not expected when the absorption capacity of the pads is not exceeded. Therefore no exposure from the consumption of the packed food is expected. The Panel also considered that none of these starting substances and the cross-linked polymer gives rise to concern for genotoxicity. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that the use of the substance acrylic acid, sodium salt, co-polymer with acrylic acid, methyl ester, methacrylic acid, 2 hydroxypropylester, and acrylic acid cross-linked does not raise a safety concern when used as fibres in absorber pads for the packaging of fresh or frozen meat, poultry, fish, fruits and vegetables under conditions under which the absorption capacity of the pads is not exceeded and mechanical release of the fibres from the pads is excluded...|$|E

40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids {{deals with the}} safety evaluation of the additive 1, 3, 5 -tris(2, 2 -dimethylpropanamido) benzene with the CAS No. 745070 - 61 - 5, the Ref. No 95420, the <b>FCM</b> <b>Substance</b> <b>No</b> 784, {{for use as a}} nucleating agent/clarifier at a maximum use level of 250 mg/kg in polyprolylene (PP). Final articles are intended to be used in contact with all type of foods for short term contact (1 hour) at temperatures up to 100 ºC and/or for long term storage at ambient temperature or below. Specific migration of the substance into 3 % acetic acid, 10 % ethanol and olive oil, was measured to be up to 48 µg/kg, 79 µg/kg and 94 µg/kg, respectively. In vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests showed no evidence for a genotoxic potential of the substance. A 90 -day dietary toxicity study in Wistar rats showed no effects at any dose and the NOAEL was considered to be 961 mg/kg bw/day in males and 1104 mg/kg bw/day in females or higher. Therefore, the CEF Panel concluded that the substance 1, 3, 5 -tris(2, 2 -dimethylpropanamido) benzene does not raise a safety concern for the consumer if it is used in polyolefins and the migration does not exceed 5 mg/kg food...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} opinion of EFSA’s Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) {{deals with the}} risk assessment of the additive adipic acid dihydrazide, CAS No 1071 - 93 - 8, <b>FCM</b> <b>substance</b> <b>No</b> 987 {{for use as a}} crosslinker for acrylic polymer with keto side groups coated on polyolefins and adhesives in laminates made from plastics. The coating is not for direct food contact but used in inner layers of plastics laminates which are intended to be used for all types of foodstuffs at all time-temperature conditions applicable according to the laminate’s properties. Specific migration of the substance was measured from a coated low-density polyethylene (LDPE) film, the substance was not detectable (limit of detection (LOD) 0. 019 mg/kg) with the food simulants 3 % acetic acid, 10 % ethanol for 10 days at 40 °C and isooctane for 2 days at 20 °C. According the in vitro and in vivo studies available the substance is not considered genotoxic. Based on an in vivo micronucleus test, the substance is not considered to be clastogenic/aneugenic under the tested conditions. The CEF Panel concluded that there is no safety concern for the consumer if the substance is used as a crosslinker for non-self-supporting coatings on polyolefins and adhesives for laminates not in direct contact with food and its migration does not exceed 0. 050 mg/kg food...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF Panel) deals with the safety evaluation of the substance 2 H-perfluoro-[(5, 8, 11, 14 -tetramethyl) -tetraethyleneglycol ethyl propyl ether] (CAS No 37486 - 69 - 4, <b>FCM</b> <b>substance</b> <b>No</b> 903), for use as polymer production aid (PPA) for manufacturing sintered and non-sintered (processed) fluoropolymers. Finished articles are intended {{to be used for}} single and repeated contact with all kinds of foodstuffs at all temperatures. Residual content of the substance was not detected in sintered or processed (non-sintered) articles at temperatures at or above 360 Â°C and was detected in fluoropolymers processed (non-sintered) at 300 Â°C from which total mass transfer was calculated to be 13 Âµg/kg food. Based on migration modelling under highly conservative assumptions, estimated migration of the substance present at the measured residual level in articles processed (non-sintered) at temperatures of 300 Â°C, is in the range of 1 Âµg/kg. For repeated use applications, migration at each following use will be considerably lower. Based on negative results from three adequately performed in vitro genotoxicity tests, the Panel considered that the substance is non-genotoxic. The CEF Panel concluded that there is no safety concern for the consumer if the substance 2 H-perfluoro-[(5, 8, 11, 14 -tetramethyl) -tetraethyleneglycol ethyl propyl ether] is only used as a polymer production aid in the polymerisation of fluoropolymers intended for a) repeated and single use materials and articles when sintered or processed (non-sintered) at temperatures at or above 360 Â°C for at least 10 minutes or at higher temperatures for equivalent shorter times, b) repeated use materials and articles only when processed (non-sintered) at temperatures from 300 Â°C and up to 360 Â°C for at least 10 minutes...|$|E

40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of a system based on Carnobacterium maltaromaticum and a colour change indicator, acid fuchsin (CAS number 3244 - 88 - 0, <b>FCM</b> <b>Substance</b> <b>No</b> 01033), used as a time-temperature indicator on the packaging of chilled food. The micro-organism, the indicator and a nutritive medium gel are incorporated in a multilayer plastic sachet glued onto the outer layer of the food package. All the substances constituting the system, {{with the exception of}} acid fuchsin, are authorised as food additives, food colorants or novel food ingredients, or are an enzymatic digest of edible protein sources and yeast edible extract. Specific migration of acid fuchsin was estimated to be less than 7 x 10 - 9 mg/kg food. Acid fuchsin elicited a positive response in a bacterial gene mutation assay and a negative response in an in vitro micronucleus assay. Given the lack of in vivo studies, the genotoxicity potential of acid fuchsin cannot be ruled out. However, the Panel noted that the layer of the plastic sachet in contact with food contact articles behaves as a barrier which prevents any release of its content (including acid fuchsin), and that the sachet is stuck onto the outer layer of the packaging, hence is not in contact with the food. Thus no exposure to the substances constituting the system from the consumption of the packed food is expected under the intended conditions of use. Therefore, the Panel concluded that the substances of the intelligent system, C. maltaromaticum and acid fuchsin, do not raise a safety concern for the consumer when used in a plastic sachet which prevents any migration from the system into food and which is stuck onto the outer layer of the packaging of chilled food...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of the powder mixture of the active substances sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate coated with sodium carbonate and sodium silicate (<b>FCM</b> <b>substance</b> <b>No</b> 1009), bentonite (CAS No 1302 - 78 - 9, FCM No 393), sodium chloride (CAS No 7647 - 14 - 5, FCM No 985), sodium carbonate (CAS No 497 - 19 - 8, FCM No 1008) which are intended {{to be used as}} combined oxygen generator and carbon dioxide absorber in packaging containing whole fresh fruits. The powder mixture is placed in a nonwoven polyethylene sachet separated from the food by a pad. In the presence of moisture, sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate first decomposes into sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide which decomposes into water and oxygen. Sodium carbonate reacts with carbon dioxide to form sodium bicarbonate. Because the sachet is not placed in direct contact with the food or food exudates, only hydrogen peroxide which decomposes to water and oxygen may be released with no other potential migration of volatile compounds. Based on the conclusion drawn in the EU Risk Assessment Report that hydrogen peroxide is not classified as a mutagen and the results from a subchronic toxicity study with hydrogen peroxide, the Panel concluded that hydrogen peroxide does not raise a safety concern under the intended conditions of use. Therefore the CEF Panel concluded that sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate coated with sodium carbonate and sodium silicate, bentonite, sodium chloride and sodium carbonate do not raise a safety concern for the consumer when used as combined oxygen generator and carbon dioxide absorber, for packaging of whole fruits. The substances should be used in sachets which prevent the release of the powder mixture into the food. Sachets should not be in direct contact with food or food exudates...|$|E
40|$|This {{scientific}} {{opinion of the}} EFSA Panel on Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids deals with the safety evaluation of 1, 4 : 3, 6 -dianhydrosorbitol, CAS No 652 - 67 - 5 and <b>FCM</b> <b>Substance</b> <b>No</b> 364, {{for use as a}} co-monomer at 1 to 40 diol mole% in the production of polyesters along with ethylene glycol and 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane as the diol components and terephthalic acid. The final material is intended to be used for single and repeated contact with all types of foodstuffs, for short term contact at temperatures up to 100 ºC and/or for long term storage at ambient temperatures or below. Specific migration in aqueous simulants and olive oil under adequate conditions were below the current specific migration limit of 5 mg/kg food. Due to the aggressiveness of 50 % ethanol, the Panel considered that this type of polymer is not suitable for contact with high alcohol content foods. Given that all of the co-monomers have already been evaluated and considered not to raise a concern of genotoxicity, the Panel concluded that there is no concern for genotoxicity of the oligomers. Therefore, the low individual migration for low molecular weight oligomers containing both 1, 4 : 3, 6 -dianhydrosorbitol and 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane, estimated to be up to 0. 06 mg/kg into 10 % ethanol, does not raise a safety concern. The CEF Panel, concluded that the substance 1, 4 : 3, 6 -dianhydrosorbitol does not raise a safety concern for the consumer if it is used as a co-monomer at levels of up to 40 mole% of the diol component in combination with ethylene glycol and/or 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane for the production of polyesters. The existing migration limit of 5 mg/kg food should not be exceeded. In addition, polyesters made using dianhydrosorbitol together with 1, 4 -bis(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexane should not be used in contact with foods containing more than 15 % alcohol...|$|E
