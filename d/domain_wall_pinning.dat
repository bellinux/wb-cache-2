Planar nanowirestructures were fabricated by {{electron beam lithography}} followed by thin-filmdeposition via thermal evaporation. The magnetization switching behavior of individual nanowires was measured using the magneto-optical Kerr effect. For symmetrical pinning structures such as the junction between a wider domain wall injection pad and a narrower nanowire, the domain wall depinning field increases as the wire width decreases, with the depinning field increasing rapidly for wires widths below 400 nm. For <b>domain</b> <b>wall</b> <b>pinning</b> at asymmetrical structures such as a notch, {{the magnitude of the}} depinning field appears relatively insensitive to notch geometry for triangular and rectangular notch structures, compared to the influence of the wire width.

30|$|However, on {{considerably}} {{decreasing the}} capacitor size, one local defect may significantly influence the overall domain wall motion.

Thus, the <b>domain</b> <b>wall</b> <b>pinning</b> can become a more important issue as the capacitor size decreases, and this is directly relevant to the reliability of the device performance. However, to our best knowledge, <b>domain</b> <b>wall</b> <b>pinning</b> has not been reported so far in nanocapacitors of such size that can be feasible for high-memory density devices.|$|E
30|$|In summary, we have {{investigated}} <b>domain</b> <b>wall</b> <b>pinning</b> and {{its origins in}} ferroelectric nanocapacitors using piezoresponse force microscopy. Similar to previous reports, the observed <b>domain</b> <b>wall</b> <b>pinning</b> was observed due {{to the existence of}} local point defects. However, we also observed another type of the pinning source, i.e., pristine domain structures. It was found that the steps of the domain wall propagation are dependent on the pristine domain structure because locally different defect states in the place of the pristine domains can affect the domain wall motion. In both cases, pinning and de-pinning processes were observed without observation of significant domain wall bowing. The observed results can provide further information on the domain wall motion in nanocapacitors and could improve the reliability of nanoscale ferroelectric memory devices.|$|E

In the case of a spin-valve structure, it appears that the stray fields emerging from the hard layer at the notch location influence the stability of the micromagnetic configuration.

40|$|In a {{combined}} experimental and numerical study, we investigated {{the details of}} the motion and <b>pinning</b> of <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> in isolated and interacting Permalloy triangular rings (side 2 m, width 250 nm and thickness 25 nm). To induce interaction between the rings, they were arranged either in vertical chains with an apex of each triangle in proximity to the edge centre of the triangle above it, or in horizontal chains where the proximity is between the adjacent corners of the triangles. Using longitudinal and diffraction magneto-optic Kerr effects, magnetic force microscopy and micromagnetic simulations, we determined the field dependence of the spin structure in the rings. In all cases the remnant state of each ring is an ‘onion’ state characterized by two <b>domain</b> <b>walls</b> – one head to head the other tail to tail – pinned at the apexes. In isolated rings the magnetization reversal occurs between two onion states via the formation of an intermediate vortex state, which arises from the motion and annihilation of the two <b>domain</b> <b>walls.</b> In the case of the horizontal chains the reversal mechanism is unchanged except that the dipolar interaction affects the field range in which the rings are in the vortex state. In the case of vertical chains an additional intermediate state is observed during reversal. The new state involves a <b>domain</b> <b>wall</b> <b>pinned</b> {{at the center of the}} edge that is in close proximity to the apex of its neighbor.
