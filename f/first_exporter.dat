We explore export strategies of <b>first</b> time <b>exporters</b> {{and focus on the}} scope of EM SMEs internationalization activities. We tackle the question whether more focused or more diversified internationalization through exporting is beneficial for EM SMEs. We examine the impact of foreign market (geographic) diversification, product diversification and export intensity on firm performance of an entire population of EM SMEs from an emerging east European market. In addition, we test whether a complex export strategy-an export strategy of simultaneous product- and geographic export diversification-is beneficial for EM SMEs. We use a panel population data of <b>first</b> time Slovenian <b>exporters</b> in the period 1994 - 2012. We find that diversified internationalization, both in terms of product and foreign market diversity, significantly improves productivity and sales performance for EM SMEs. Furthermore, EM SMEs with complex export strategies enjoy significantly improved productivity and sales performance.

40|$|SMEs are an {{important}} segment in Australia as they are {{the majority of participants}} in export and make up the bulk of <b>first</b> <b>exporters.</b> The process of the first export {{has been the focus of}} academic research and policy decisions of governments, yet little has been done to identify the personnel involved in this process. The labels of actors involved in SME internationalisation studies have included: CEOs, decision makers, management and management team. Yet the roles of these actors in the export initiation process remain relatively unknown. There has also been little attention to the personal characteristics of actors involved in the export initiation process. Previous research has been linked to demographic characteristics such as: age, education, foreign language/s, and experience. Yet often these studies compare only one key informant in an exporting firm to another, generally in a non exporting firm, with no attempts to compare individuals involved or those not involved in export within the same firm. Although one stream of internationalisation research sees internationalisation as an innovation there has been no study of the role of innovation actors in export initiation. Innovation literature includes actors such as: champions, gate-keepers, boundary spanners and intrapreneurs who could be involved in export initiation. These actors could participate in the first export order process but they are generally not mentioned in internationalisation literature.

40|$|Background, aim {{and scope}} Regional {{specificities}} are a key factor when analyzing {{the environmental impact of}} a biofuel pathway through a life cycle assessment (LCA). Due to different energy mixes, transport distances, agricultural practices and land use changes, results can significantly vary from one country to another. The Republic of Argentina is the <b>first</b> <b>exporter</b> of soybean oil and meal and the third largest soybean producer in the world, and therefore, soybean-based biodiesel production is expected to significantly increase in the near future, mostly for exportation. Moreover, Argentinean biodiesel producers will need to evaluate the environmental performances of their product in order to comply with sustainability criteria being developed. However, because of regional specificities, the environmental performances of this biofuel pathway can be expected to be different from those obtained for other countries and feedstocks previously studied. This work aims at analyzing the environmental impact of soybean-based biodiesel production in Argentina for export. The relevant impact categories account for the primary non-renewable energy consumption (CED), the global warming potential (GWP), the eutrophication potentia...|$|E

However, {{in the last years}} kiwifruit yields and the total cultivated area considerably decreased, due to the pandemic spread of the bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa). Several climatic conditions and cultural practices affect the development of the bacterial canker. This research work focused on the impact of agricultural practices and microclimate conditions on the incidence and epidemiology of Psa in the orchard. Therefore, the effect of fertilization, irrigation, use of bio-regulators, rootstock, training system and pruning were examined. The effect of different tunnel systems was analyzed as well, to study the plant-pathogen interaction. Considering the importance of insects as vectors in other pathosystems, the role of Metcalfa pruinosa in the spread of the bacterial canker was investigated in controlled conditions. In addition, quality and storage properties of fruits from infected plants were assessed. The study of all these aspects of the agronomic practices is useful to define a strategy to limit the bacterial diffusion in the orchard. Overall, excess nitrogen fertilization, water stress, stagnant water supplies, pruning before summer and the high number of Metcalfa pruinosa increased the Psa incidence. In contrast, tunnel covers may be useful for the control of the disease, with special attention to the kind of material...|$|E

Second, new exporters replace existing suppliers with imported alternatives. Third, exporting leads to pecuniary spillovers passed onto domestic suppliers, observed in higher revenue productivity.

40|$|Since Arrow (1962), spillovers from pioneer to {{follower}} in non-excludable innovations {{are central}} {{to our understanding of}} endogenous economic growth. Nonetheless, evidence of these spillovers in less-developed economies has been elusive. Our paper contributes by showing novel facts consistent with externalities in new export products. To avoid biases towards ex-post successes, we use data on the universe of customs transactions from Chile (1990 - 2006). We find that, first, follower firms are more likely to enter a product if the pioneer firm survives exporting. More importantly, we also find that pioneers enter and remain smaller than followers, which is indicative that the <b>first</b> <b>exporter</b> may not be the firm that benefits the most from the discovery. This fact is inconsistent with the currently standard view in international trade, in which the largest firm would be the first willing to pay a homogeneous sunk cost of exporting. In contrast, our facts are consistent with the view that smaller pioneer exporters are data producers, whose spillovers benefit larger followers. We offer a simple model to formalize this intuition, {{based on the idea that}} large exporters have more choices on how to allocate their managerial capacity. This real option makes large exporters wait, as to assign their marginal manager on the best possible project. In contrast, smaller and more focused firms prefer to be pioneers.

We employ the bivariate probit regression on a system of innovation and exporting equations as well as matching procedures to tease out the direction of causality between exporting status and innovation activity. Our results suggest a strong positive relationship between exporting and innovation activity in both directions, while results on the impacts of lagged export (or innovation) status on the probability to start innovating (or exporting) are less conclusive. In other words, whereby innovating status increases the probability of exporting it does not increase the probability of becoming a <b>first</b> time <b>exporter,</b> and vice versa.
