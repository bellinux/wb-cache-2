5|$|A {{tropical}} depression first <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> September 14 over the Pacific Ocean {{west of the}} Mexican coast. Six hours later, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Norbert. Gradually strengthening, Norbert meandered in the weak steering currents for several days.

5|$|A {{tropical}} storm <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> November23 about 460mi (740km) northeast of Barbuda in the Lesser Antilles. It moved northeastward, strengthening to peak winds of 50mph (85km/h) on November24. It later turned sharply {{to the west}} as it began a weakening trend, followed by a curve to the north. The cyclone dissipated on November26 about 450mi (725km) east-northeast of Bermuda, without ever affecting land.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the 20 tropical storms, there were several tropical depressions of lesser intensity. The first <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> June 1 in the northwest Caribbean and dissipated a few days later. Another depression <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> July 11 over Panama and also quickly dissipated. A tropical depression <b>developed</b> <b>on</b> July 17 in the northeastern Atlantic west of the Azores, and one ship reported hurricane-force winds; however, there was little evidence that the tropical system was organized, {{so it was not}} classified as a tropical storm. Originally, there was a tropical storm in the database in the Caribbean in the middle of August, but it was downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of any reports of gale-force winds. Similarly, there was a tropical storm in the database in late September, but it was also downgraded to a tropical depression due to lack of gale-force winds.|$|E
