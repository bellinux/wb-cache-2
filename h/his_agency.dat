25|$|According to Kanungo, states Goldie Osuri, the Jagannath {{tradition}} {{has been a}} means of legitimizing royalty.

25|$|Edwin Land, the {{developer}} of instant photography, and {{another member of}} the panel proposed to Dulles through Dulles' aide, Richard M. Bissell, Jr., that <b>his</b> <b>agency</b> should fund and operate this aircraft. Land believed that the military operating the CL-282 during peacetime could provoke a war. Although Dulles remained reluctant to have the CIA conduct its own overflights, Land and James Killian of MIT told President Eisenhower about the aircraft; Eisenhower agreed that the CIA should be the operator. Dulles finally agreed, but some USAF officers opposed the project because they feared it would endanger the RB-57D and X-16. The USAF's Seaberg helped persuade his own agency to support the CL-282, albeit with the higher-performance J57 engine, and final approval for a joint USAF-CIA project (the first time the CIA dealt with sophisticated technology) came in November 1954. Lockheed had meanwhile become busy with other projects and had to be persuaded to accept the CL-282 contract after approval.|$|E
