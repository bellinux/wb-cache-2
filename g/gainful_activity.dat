50|$|The Sha’atang {{epitomizes the}} Mbaw-Yakum people {{because it is}} a period of communion and reunion. Before the coming of the Christmas, villagers knew that they had to buy new dresses for their {{children}} during Sha’atang. Before the reign of Fon Ghogomu, death celebrations of late Fons were frequent often provoked by problems that threatened the welfare and health of the Fondom. In such situations, the gods of the land were always consulted. A common answer was that one of the late Fons was angry that the villagers have neglected him for long. An eleven days of ceremonies (to usher peace) was then observed and the celebration carried out. If after this a similar revelation was made of another Fon, another death celebration was carried out immediately, so that a lot of time for farming and other <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> were lost this way. Because of this Fon Ghogomu suggested to the Kwifon that the celebration of all late Fons could be jointly done, once a year. i.e an Annual Cultural Festival. This period is a week of peace (retreat) when there should be no quarreling, fighting, shouting and farming. The rest of the period could therefore be used for farming and other <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> since this is done once a year.|$|R

30|$|Agriculture is an {{important}} source of income and at times, villagers suffer loss due to erratic, low rainfall and power deficit for ground water irrigation. With the increasing cost for lifting ground water, the price yielded from crops is short to cover the expenses. The vagaries in the returns from agriculture force the people to scout for other occupations as a cushion. The villagers perceive that other avenues such as business and employment provide better earnings, as evident from the shift in the principal source of income in some of the villages. Changes in their lifestyle also make the villagers look towards the neighboring city for <b>gainful</b> <b>activities.</b> Educated people have almost completely exited from agriculture or livestock as their key occupation. The village which showed preference towards agriculture was Ramnagar (64.7 % increase), while the village that moved away was Darapur [37.04 % decline, (Fig.  5)]. In Banjara Nangla, 75 % of the villagers shifted from agriculture, the highest (100 %) occupation in the village in 1991, to salaries/wages.|$|R

As a matter of this fact, a more general concept of the discussed problem is a seniors’ position on the labor market from the point of view of income and related insurance and health contributions.

Current European agricultural statistics (Farm Accountancy Data Network) capture few indicators that assess such strategies, but complementing data collected during the EU Framework 7 project FLINT have allowed the adoption of risk management strategies and the determinants of farmers’ preference for complementary or substitute instruments to be assessed. Adoption rates of risk management instruments such as insurance contracts, price contracts, off-farm income, other types risk of reduction measures and other <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> vary signifi cantly across EU Member States and farming types. Econometric analysis indicates that larger farms more often adopt crop insurance, occupational accident insurance, price contracts and diversifi cation but are less likely to adopt credit avoidance and off-farm employment (at a signifi cance level of 1 per cent). For policy analyses these indicators are a step forward for the determination of the net impacts and establishment of counterfactuals in the long term (i. e. time series encompassing also adverse years) for measuring the impact of the CAP at farm level...|$|R

We have grouped the socio-economic characterics around the headings "local resources", "economic activities" and "supply of labour". We base our analysis on 465 regions in the EU 15, which we have divided into three groups: most rural regions, intermediate regions and most urban regions. Within each of these groups we have made a further distinction into leading (i. e. high non-agricultural employment growth) and lagging (i. e. low non-agricultural employment growth) regions. The analysis shows that leading rural regions have both growth of industrial employment and services employment and show a population growth as well, whereas in lagging rural regions population growth stagnates. Besides, leading rural regions tend to have a lower unemployment rate than lagging regions and tend to have a higher infrastructure endowment (highways, railways and waterways). On the other hand for quite a number of socio-economic indicators hardly any differences have been found between leading and lagging rural regions, like participation rates, education level of the population, average firm size, share of female employed in total employment and the share of farm holders with other <b>gainful</b> <b>activities...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} land fragmentation in Ute Districts of Vandeikya Local Government Area of Benue State in Nigeria {{with a view to}} gaining insight into its nature, extent and effect on the socio-economy of the area. To achieve this objective, 129 farm plots together with their owners were randomly selected and studied. Dimensions of individual plots and distances between plots and owners’ residences were determined through field measurements. A questionnaire survey was also conducted to obtain information on number of plots held per farming household in the area. In addition, aerial photographs taken over the area in 1977 and topographical maps of the area as well as reports were studied to get baseline data on the extent of fragmentation in the past. Analysis of data showed that, average size of farm plot in 1977 was 0. 171 hectare, and declined to 0. 149 hectare in 2009. Mean number of plots per farmer in 2009 was 5. 37 and mean number of plots cultivated in the same year was 3. 68, while range of plot holdings was between 2. 67 and 10. 00. Using Januszewski’s index of fragmentation, a value of 0. 173 was derived, indicating extreme pulverization of farm plots in the area. It was also found that farm plots were not only small, but also scattered over space. The study noted the diseconomies of land fragmentation arising from its severe limitation on mechanization and input investment in farm enterprise. It however recommends support for fragmentation in the area as a realistic response to ecological and demographic imperatives and as a way of stabilizing the socio-economy. It also recommends diversification from agriculture to other <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> in the area to augment proceeds from the small and inappropriately distributed farm plots. ...|$|R
40|$|Disability is {{considered}} in our environment {{to be not}} only work ability limitation resulting in the loss of income and reducing the opportunities of economic activities, but also to include a social aspect. One of the most frequent causes of disabilities is the loss or reduction of capability to perform systematic <b>gainful</b> <b>activities</b> due to the musculoskeletal system impairment. Issues of health evaluation are very important especially with regard to providing certain connection between the assessment of health state and work ability in relation to the capability of job assignments and evaluation of preserved work ability. The aim of the bachelor thesis was to investigate a group of citizens applying for disability pension due to the musculoskeletal system impairment in České Budějovice District in 2007 and consequently to evaluate the impact of age, physical work and education on the number of such applicants. Three hypotheses have been established: 1. People applying for disability pension approval due to the musculoskeletal system impairment are mostly elderly people more than 55 year old, 2. People applying for disability pension approval due to the musculoskeletal system impairment are mostly people having manual labour, and 3. People applying for disability pension approval due to the musculoskeletal system impairment are usually of lower education level. To obtain necessary information, I have chosen a quantitative research, the method of secondary and content analysis of data. Selected sample from the basic group of population has been chosen using a method of random selection. All information has been sourced from written documents without the necessity of personal interviewing with observed people. Analysis and evaluation of data obtained have shown that the first hypothesis was not confirmed since the applicants for disability pension due to the musculoskeletal system impairment were not over the age of 55. The second and third hypotheses have been confirmed unambiguously. 84. 8 % of observed applicants work manually and 79. 73 % of observed applicants have lower level of education. Regarding the results of the research survey, it would be interesting and beneficial to focus on investigating the disability of these groups of applicants in relation of their social situation and job market engagement...|$|R

40|$|Women's {{participation}} in economic {{activities in the}} developing world is mostly confined to the informal sectors of the economy. In most cases, women are significantly over represented in the more vulnerable areas of employment such as unpaid family work, seasonal agricultural laborers and domestic servants. Female entrepreneurs are highly marginalized and disempowered in the formal sectors {{in the developing world}} economies. This is evident from the patriarchal system that largely assumed women as naturally inferior to men. In most developing economies, the contribution of female entrepreneurs to the national development and economic transformation is very minimal. The paper aims at examining the current trend in female entrepreneurship in the developing world. The central focus is on women in small and medium scale enterprises (SMEs) and the role they played in the economic transformation of their communities. The methodology is based on the review of recent relevant literature and the analysis of secondary data. The findings revealed that the representations of women in entrepreneurial activities in most developing countries are very low due to low levels of education and gender inequality.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the first results of ETLA and Etlatieto Ltd Study of Finnish biotechnology firms. The majority of Finnish biotechnology firms are quite young {{and still in}} the early stages of <b>gainful</b> economic <b>activities.</b> Their turnover, profits and exports are, for the younger firms in particular, still low, profits even negative, while their growth expectations are high. The high R&D intensity of especially younger firms indicates that their products are still largely in the development phase and that few of their products are yet in the market. The commercialisation process is long, and only a few of the innovations eventually turn out to be exploitable. This increases the risk assessed and the rate of returns required by the investors. Private and public venture capitalists are most interested in the young companies with relatively high risk and high growth prospects. The oldest firms are more often subsidiaries. This may reflect the fact that foreign companies are willing to take over a Finnish company when its growth prospects are close to being realised. Furthermore, large proportion of the companies have obtained some public funding for the research which led to the foundation of the company or which took place in some other stages of the life cycle of the company. Research spin-off companies in general have more hindrances than other start-up firms, and would benefit from more systematic training in relevant business skills, such as how to make a business plan, how to deal with patenting, and how to obtain funding from venture capital investors...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{decision-making}} {{authority is}} one of the ways of measuring the female empowerment, although mere participation in any matter does not corroborate full empowerment of women. However, participation in decision-making process in household matters considers that a female is accounted in the family. Objective: The present study investigated to the extent at which the female adolescents participated in decision-making process in household matters and assessed the factors influencing them. Study Setting: Both rural and urban areas of Bangladesh. Study Design: A quantitative and a qualitative study designs were adopted for this study. Sample Size and Sampling: A cluster sampling technique was used to select the sample. A sample of 3362 female adolescents irrespective of their marital status was selected using a cluster sampling technique. To complement the results found in quantitative analysis, a series of focus group discussions were also conducted among the adolescents. Results: The analysis revealed that {{a large proportion of the}} study adolescents did not participate in any decision-making process in their household matters. Only about one-third (31. 1 &#x 0025;) of the adolescents participated in any household matter; however, the acceptance of their opinions was minimal. In spite of little participation of adolescents in family matters, multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that older adolescents aged 15 - 19 years, years of schooling, work status, and the family members with a positive attitude toward female education appeared to be the influencing factors for adolescent participation in household affairs (P < 0. 05).

40|$|This Article {{applies the}} method of text and {{principle}} to an important problem in constitutional interpretation: the constitutional legitimacy of the modem regulatory state and its expansive definition of federal commerce power Some originalists argue that the modem state cannot be justified, while others accept existing precedents as a 2 ̆ 2 pragmatic exception 2 ̆ 2 to originalism. Nonoriginalists, in turn, point to these difficulties as a refutation of originalist premises. Contemporary originalist readings have tended to view the commerce power through modem eyes. Originalists defending narrow readings offederal power have identified 2 ̆ 2 commerce 2 ̆ 2 with the trade of commodities; originalists defending broad readings of federal power have identified 2 ̆ 2 commerce 2 ̆ 2 with all <b>gainful</b> economic <b>activity.</b> In the eighteenth century, however 2 ̆ 2 commerce 2 ̆ 2 did not have such narrowly economic connotations. Instead, 2 ̆ 2 commerce 2 ̆ 2 meant 2 ̆ 2 intercourse 2 ̆ 2 {{and it had a}} strongly social connotation. 2 ̆ 2 Commerce 2 ̆ 2 was interaction and exchange between persons or peoples. To have commerce with someone meant to converse with them, meet with them, or interact with them. Thus, commerce naturally included all trade and economic activity because economic activity was social activity. But the idea of commerce-as-intercourse was broader than economics narrowly conceived-it also included networks of transportation and communication through which people traveled, interacted, and corresponded with each other. Understanding 2 ̆ 2 commerce 2 ̆ 2 in its original sense of 2 ̆ 2 intercourse 2 ̆ 2 is consistent with all of the evidence offered by rival theories of commerce as trade or economic activity; but it better explains the source of Congress 2 ̆ 7 s powers over immigration and foreign affairs. It also better explains Congress 2 ̆ 7 s broad powers over transportation and communications networks, whether or not these networks are used for purposes of business or trade. Congress 2 ̆ 7 s power to regulate commerce 2 ̆ 2 among the several states 2 ̆ 2 is closely linked to the general structural purpose behind Congress 2 ̆ 7 s enumerated powers as articulated by the Framers-to give Congress power to legislate in all cases where states are separately incompetent or where the interests of the nation might be undermined by unilateral or conflicting state action. Properly understood, the commerce power authorizes Congress to regulate problems or activities that produce spillover effects between states or generate collective action problems that concern more than one state. This basic structural principle explains why Congress 2 ̆ 7 s commerce power inevitably expanded with the rise of a modern integrated economy and society, and it explains and justifies most if not all of modern doctrine. This approach justifies the constitutionality of federal regulation of labor law, consumer protection law, environmental law, and antidiscrimination law; it even shows why a federal mandate for individuals to purchase health insurance is constitutional. Finally, this approach shows why there are still areas where federal commerce power does not extend-these are areas where Congress cannot reasonably claim that an activity produces interstate spillovers or collective action problems, and does not involve networks of transportation and communication...|$|R
40|$|Since no {{society can}} make any {{progress}} {{in a state}} of chaos and disorder, it is axiomatic to postulate that the conditions of law and order must have direct and significant bearing on the pace and pattern of economic development of a country. Despite the fact that lawlessness has a significant impact on economic development, a rigorous analysis on the linkages between the two remains conspicuous by its absence in the general economic literature. The only redeeming feature of the literature concerned with the identification of sources of economic growth is that during the last half a century, empirical research has come to focus on the relationship between political instability (one obvious manifestation of law and order situation) and economic growth. A few interesting studies (mentioned in Chapter 2) have appeared in recent years which have explored the impact of political instability on growth of the specific countries and specific regions. Paradoxically, however, the issue of the linkages between law and order and economic development has generally remained neglected both in theoretical and empirical literature concerned with the identification of sources of development. This study attempts at filling in the existing gap by presenting a quantitative measurement of the impact of lawlessness on Pakistan's economic development with special reference to the years 1969 - 1993 though other critical periods have also been touched upon. For this purpose it has been divided into six parts extending over twenty chapters punctuated by eight appendices, relevant tables and graphic presentations. Abbreviations and glossary of some important terms have also been added. The sources of information, too, have been duly incorporated in a bibliography prepared in an alphabetical order and further classified into original (unpublished/restricted sources), books /handbooks, journals/periodicals/magazines, newspapers, UNO reports, general reports, electronic media, encyclopaedia, publications/reports, seminars (papers & proceedings), laws/acts/rules, draft papers, lectures, research papers and manuals. The scheme of things is epitomised as under: Part I Part I consisting of Chapter I introduces the present study with reference to its aim. In the process vital subjects like security and development, global concern for crimes, development - retarding crimes, importance of rule of law, Pakistan's economy and lawlessness and proposed crime - curbing strategy have been briefly touched upon. On this basis the plans of the research and its scope and limitations have been delineated. Part II Part II consists of conceptual frame work extending over chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Chapter 2 discusses linkage between law and order and economic development. Having defined "law and order" it explains two key terms i. e. LAOC (law and order condition) and LAOS (law and order situation). The term law and order condition (LAOC) can be used in juxtaposition to the aforementioned term law and order situation, (LAOS). The "law and order condition" is supposed to prevail when the basic socio-economic framework of the country is intact and is not facing a break-down on account of any factors leading to a law filled order situation with the result that economic growth continues without any hindrance or interruption. Hence a society which experiences law and order situation would be one which fails to meet the LAOC. In brief LAOS and LAOC, in the context of our discussion, represent mutually exclusive social structures and phenomena. With reference to these two key terms Chapter 2 examines law and order in selected growth theories. It points out that law and order was assumed as a given factor in these growth theories and its significance was recognized implicitly. Law and order as a determinant of economic development was spelled out in explicit terms only in the theories of growth advanced by the later day economists and economic historians such as J. J Spangler and W. W. Rostow. The crux of J. J. Spanglerâ€™s argument is that the structure of the prevalent value system of a community can reasonably be considered as an important condition of law and order, because the value system defines the basic norms and ethos of human conduct. For example, if the value system of a society is predominated by sectarian or ethnic dispensations, then such a society would be continuously ridden by law and order problems, thus putting frequent twists and turns to the process of economic growth. W. W. Rostow, too, emphasises the role of political factors, institutions and the law and order framework in determining the pattern of economic growth. He reinforces the importance of these factors with reference to the primary tasks of any legal government {{in the shape of the}} provision of security, welfare and growth and constitutional order. Chapter 2 further elaborates this point by considering Rostow's law and order expenditure approach as applied to Pakistan. It further elucidates the conceptual framework with reference to Professor Douglas North's exposition of the critical role of the rule of law and equitable enforcement of legislation in affecting lasting economic reforms and building democratic institutions in various countries in the context of the new branch of economic thought which he calls New Institutional Economics. The conceptual aspects with reference to the interconnection between law and order and economic development are further explained in this chapter by taking into consideration Paul P. Streeten's emphasis on the need for a perception of relative security for the continuation of <b>gainful</b> economic <b>activity.</b> Chapter 3 examines law and order in selected growth measurement models. Using Cobb-Douglas Production Function an attempt has been made in this chapter to assess the role of law and order in economic development of Pakistan. In this context the impact of ideal law and order conditions on optimum employment of labour and capital with maximum output of goods and services has been pinpointed with reference to the macro-level data for the years 1963 - 64 to 1987 - 88. It has also been shown in this chapter that a significant deterioration of the law and order situation would inevitably generate a vicious circle of lower capacity utilization, larger level of unemployment and capital flight. Using Matrix - Shaped Algorithm Linkages. Chapter 3 also attempts to measure the impact of lawlessness on economic development with reference to channels generating uncertainty, causing lack of security, bringing about discontinuity and augmenting lack of confidence. These four channels of law and order situation are depicted in Matrix 'A' of Figure- 3. 1 on Algorithm of Linkages between law and order situation and economic development. In Matrix B, the main constituents of economic development, namely, labour, capital stock, technology and management, and government policies and social institutions are presented. Finally Matrix 'C' which is the interactive matrix of the Matrix 'A' and Matrix 'B', provides us with one of the configurations of the linkages between law and order situation 3. Q. d economic development. The relationship between law and order and economic development has been further explained in Chapter 3 with reference to Computable General Equilibrium Model. It mentions real and nominal flows pertaining to various indicators like production, investment, and markets of products, labour and capital, value of outp 1 i 1 t, expenditure and a host of factors related to consumption and investment demand. It establishes logical relationships with regard to endogenous and exogenous Variables They are, by and large, affected by the prevailing law and order situation. The effect has been further considered from the micro-economic perspective by taking into account the behaviors of banks as they allocate credit to the competing borrowers with projects with different levels of risk. This chapter then concludes by pointing various economic factors including labour, capital stock, technology, management investment, savings, banking transactions and host of related economic activities affected by lawlessness. Though all of them are affected by and affect economic Performance yet the degree to which they are linked with the prevailing law and order situation varies.
