40|$|The {{liberalization}} {{of foreign exchange}} regulations in the Philippines starting {{in the second half}} of 1992 turned out to be a major challenge to balance of payments (BOP) compilers as the bank reporting system, which is the main source of data for the external sector accounts, is no longer able to fully capture all foreign exchange transactions. Administrative data should have compensated for the weaknesses of the bank reporting system, but the availability, frequency and timeliness of data from some data-providing agencies posed a big problem. To address some of the gaps uncovered in statistical compilation, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) introduced in the last quarter of 2000 cross border transactions surveys that aim to collect information on transactions of residents with non-residents that do not pass the banking system. These transactions include those involving intercompany or offsetting accounts with parent companies abroad and those that are settled through offshore accounts of residents. While the initial intent was to encourage the participation in the survey of all companies with cross border transactions, the BSP had to limit the respondents to a relatively small sample size that is considered to contribute an appreciable amount to the BOP. This was so because aside from being too costly to administer in terms of manpower requirements, the survey suffers from a low participation rate given the absence of a legal authority by the BSP to collect data <b>from</b> <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations.</b> This paper will discuss the problems in gathering inputs for BOP compilation, the benefits and constraints in using surveys as a data source to supplement the bank reports and other existing administrative data, as well as future plans to improve the administration of the cross border transactions surveys.

Issuance trends have changed significantly {{over the past century}} as bond markets have become more diverse, sophisticated and globally integrated. A number of changes over the past century are discussed: (i) today, issuance is largely by private entities whereas it was dominated by government-owned corporations historically; (ii) the issuer base has shifted <b>from</b> being mostly <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> towards banks; (iii) a wide range of entities are now able to tap the bond market; (iv) Australian corporations now raise a large share of funds offshore; and (v) the investor base has shifted away from direct holdings by households towards indirect holdings through superannuation/managed funds and holdings by non-residents. These developments have largely been due to: the evolution {{of the structure of the}} Australian economy; privatisations; and changes in the regulatory landscape, particularly the deregulation of the banking system in the 1980 s, and the floating of the exchange rate and abolition of capital controls in 1983. 33 page(s...|$|R

Using German data, we employ Bayesian vector autoregressive models with sign restrictions on the impulse response functions in order to enquire the role of loan supply and monetary policy shocks for the dynamics of loans to <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations.</b> For the three quarters following the Lehman collapse, we find very strong negative loan supply shocks, while monetary policy was essentially neutral. Nevertheless, the historical decomposition shows a cumulated negative impact of loan supply shocks and monetary policy shocks on loans to <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations,</b> due to the lagged effects of past loan supply and monetary policy shocks. However, these negative effects on loans to <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> are overcompensated by positive other shocks, which implies that loans developed more favorably than implied by the model, over the past few quarters.

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} examine the {{aggregate}} national balance-sheets of <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> in Australia and the G 7 countries {{with a view}} to assessing both their financial structure and their financial position. More importantly, the authors investigate whether the financial position of <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> (i. e., debt-to-equity ratio) is material to the economy's investment prospects and whether the importance of this channel differs depending on the structure of corporate financing i. e., bank-based or market-oriented financing structures. Based on a dynamic business investment error-correction model that controls for the opportunity cost of capital and output growth, the authors test the above hypotheses using a quarterly panel dataset of eight developed economies over the 1992 - 2005 period. Their empirical results suggest that the financial position of <b>non-financial</b> <b>corporations</b> has a statistically significant impact on aggregate business investment growth, although the effect is quantitatively modest. Thus, their findings are consistent with the prediction of models that feature credit market imperfections such as costly information and asymmetric information.
