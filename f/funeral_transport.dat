Here will {{be found}} an {{instance}} of a foot-note designed for the edition of Prevost's complete works, " The French custom is inconvenient for the carrying of a corpse " the abbé Prévost wrote in Cleveland. R. F. gives to this enigmatic sentence its full historical meaning in describing the rites of embalming and of <b>funeral</b> <b>transport</b> during the old Regime period.

40|$|A {{well known}} {{characteristic}} of Italy is the deep {{gap in the}} economic development between the North and the South, {{but there is also}} a huge difference in the quality of social capital, so that the culture of illegality is much more present in some of southern regions, where organised crime is particularly strong. The first part of this paper describes the main differences among the most important criminal organizations of Southern Italy. The second part examines the major effects of organised crime in the economy of Mezzogiorno. In addition to a description of the link between the presence of mafia and the economic underdevelopment, that has been already discussed in other researches, this study focuses on local public service costs in some southern municipalities where the work of mafia is more pervasive. The econometric analyses confirms the hypothesis that the presence of mafia can be the cause of higher costs, especially in <b>funeral</b> <b>transports</b> and in the collection and disposal of waste material. ...|$|R
25|$|The next day, funeral rites for King {{were held}} in his {{hometown}} of Atlanta, Georgia. The service at Ebenezer Baptist Church was nationally televised, as were these other events. A <b>funeral</b> procession <b>transported</b> King's body for 3.5 miles through the streets of Atlanta, followed by more than 100,000 mourners, from the church to his alma mater of Morehouse College. A second service was held there before the burial.|$|R
50|$|Billy {{tries to}} visit Nena sooner but is {{thrown out of}} the {{hospital}} by a security guard. Billy’s attempt to enlist the aid of the foreign embassy is equally unsuccessful. When Tuesday’s visiting hours finally arrive, Billy cannot locate his wife. He spots the physician who first evaluated Nena. The doctor regretfully announces that Nena bled to death sixty hours after hospital admission. No one could find Billy to apprise him of the situation so Nena’s parents have already arranged the <b>funeral</b> and <b>transported</b> the body home for burial. Billy exits the hospital with thoughts of violence and revenge for his calamity.|$|R
50|$|When {{he became}} ill, {{he made his}} son Crown Prince Savang Vatthana regent. His son succeeded him on his death in 1959. He was cremated and buried in That Luang in 1961, and during his <b>funeral</b> {{procession}} was <b>transported</b> by the royal funeral carriage, a 12-metre-high wooden hearse with a carved seven-headed serpent. Many representatives were at the state funeral including Prince Bhanubandhu Yugala, who represented Thailand.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1896 Sahl {{sustained}} a stroke, {{and went to}} Fiji, {{on one of his}} plantations there, to regain his health. Returning to Sydney in August 1896, Sahl suffered another stroke soon after. In significantly bad health, in early 1897 Sahl suffered from [...] "an attack of inflammation of the lungs", which led to his death at his Sydney residence on 1 April. His death was greatly mourned, with a large <b>funeral</b> cortege <b>transporting</b> his body for burial at Waverley Cemetery being escorted by contingents from the German naval ships present in Sydney Harbour, SMS Falke and SMS Bussard, and a small contingent from the Austro-Hungarian Gunboat also present in Sydney, SMS Albatross.|$|R
50|$|The {{funeral and}} burial of Abraham Lincoln, 16th President of the United States, {{took place in}} 1865 {{following}} his assassination, and included a three-week series of events held to mourn his death and memorialize his life. After Abraham Lincoln's April 15, 1865 death, funeral services were held in Washington, D.C., and then at additional locations as a <b>funeral</b> train <b>transported</b> his remains for burial {{in his hometown of}} Springfield, Illinois. The body was accompanied by dignitaries. Lincoln's eldest son Robert Todd rode the train to Baltimore and then disembarked and returned to the White House. Lincoln's wife Mary Todd Lincoln remained at the White House because she was too distraught to make the trip. Robert took a later train to Springfield for his father's final funeral and burial.|$|R
5000|$|There {{has been}} a church in Rugsund (on the island of Rugsundøya) since the 13th century. The first church was a stave church that was {{replaced}} in 1650. The present church building was constructed in 1838 after the previous one burned down. [...] The church in Rugsund has a long history, but the church carrying this name today was erected at a different site than the earlier Rugsund churches. When the former church burned down, it had {{for a long time}} been a problem that the graveyard at Rugsundøya had such a shallow layer of soil. This was an important reason why a new graveyard and church site was moved to the mainland. As a matter of fact, the soil conditions were so bad at the earlier church site that <b>funeral</b> parties <b>transported</b> masses of soil by boat to the graveyard.|$|R

50|$|The present {{station was}} officially opened on 4 August 1906 and opening for {{passengers}} on 5 August 1906. The new station included the previous Mortuary railway station used to <b>transport</b> <b>funeral</b> parties to Rookwood Cemetery. The last train departed platform 5 of the 1874 station at midnight. During {{the remainder of}} that night, the passenger concourse was demolished and the line extended through the old station into the new station. The Western Mail arrived at 05:50 on 5 August 1906 at the new station. Devonshire Street, which separated the two stations, became a pedestrian underpass {{to allow people to}} cross the railway line and is now known by many as the Devonshire Street Tunnel.|$|R

Alexander Barclay, , and Doctor Martene Schenes, {{official}} doctor of the king, {{were called to}} [...] "supply certain drugs, , and other geer, {{for the use of}} the Lady Margaret, during the time of her sickness" [...] and assist the infant, but to no avail. Margaret died sometime during the very same month she became ill, but the exact date was never recorded. Later in March, she was embalmed, her body was decorated with flannel, crimson silk and Florence ribbon, to prepare her for the <b>funeral.</b> She was <b>transported</b> from Linlithgow to Edinburgh and was privately interred in Holyrood Abbey, now in ruins.|$|R
25|$|This great {{emphasis}} on the performativity of tomb figurines {{could be related to}} the competitive Tang culture of publicly displaying one’s wealth and power. The social classes of Tang society were mobile. This means that people in the different social classes could improve its status through hard work and move to an upper class. This created a competitive society, where people often showed off their wealth and power. Members of prominent families or high-ranking officials often paraded through streets in the public, with troops of servants mounted on beautiful horses. This culture of public display takes place even during funerals. After the funerary ceremonies at home are complete, there would be a <b>funeral</b> procession to <b>transport</b> the deceased from home to gravesite.|$|R
40|$|The {{building}} of the Via Appia was ordered in 312 BC by Censor Appius Claudius Caecus. It was a remarkable project for several reasons: first, it was uncommon for a censor to have this type of power, but more importantly: never before had such a durable and great road been built. It first led to Terracina, a stretch with unparalleled straightness, then to Capua and to Brindisi. It was built with innovative techniques. The poet Statius called it ‘Regina Viarum’ (Statius Silvae II. II. 12) : the Queen of Roads. Today, {{it is the only}} surviving ancient road leaving Rome that is a place of public interest. This thesis is a biography of the sometimes turbulent past of the Via Appia Antica. It researches how the road has become what it is today by writing about the most important time periods that have influenced the layout of the road, but also its Romantic atmosphere. The road has been in use continuously up to the present day, although for different purposes. During the Roman Republic and the Empire, it was used for travel, <b>funerals,</b> <b>transport</b> and military missions. In the Middle Ages, it became both a destination for Christian pilgrimage and a gold mine for reusable materials. The destruction and robbing of the ancient structures was at its peak during the Renaissance: Europeans came to Rome and brought home enormous amounts of art and antiquities to refurnish their palaces. In the sixteenth century the Via Appia was abandoned when high taxes discouraged its travellers and the Via Appia Nuova was built. Nevertheless, the road endured and received renewed attention during Romanticism with the ‘Grand Tour’ of wealthy Europeans. In its state of decay, the Via Appia was popularly painted and it has left us with a great record of eighteenth and nineteenth century paintings. Today, the road looks the way it does in these paintings: it has responded to the Romantic ideal. Now the Via Appia is a place of residency and recreation. It is used for hiking, cycling and picknicking, but also, at night, for illegal activities. The stakeholders of the road today vary and have conflicting interests. Although a usual biography tells the history of a person, an object or a landscape, this thesis goes the extra mile by also dedicating a chapter to {{the current state of the}} road, which is just as much part of the ancient ‘regina viarum’ as any other period of time. An important part of the research for this thesis was made possible by the 'Koninklijk Nederlands Instituut Rome' (KNIR), through a scholarship for a stay of one month, enabling access to the library and the Via Appia Antica itself...|$|R
50|$|In December, the {{psychiatric}} hospital in Boston calls and informs Gram that Liza is {{in a critical}} state and may not live much longer. Dicey and Gram travel to Boston, and find Liza catatonic, not responding to any treatment. Liza soon dies and, since they can't afford {{the cost of a}} <b>funeral</b> or of <b>transporting</b> Liza's body from Boston to Crisfield, Gram and Dicey decide to cremate her. Dicey is given a hand-carved wooden box by the owner of a local gift store who is touched by her situation. When Dicey and Gram arrive back in Crisfield, the family buries the wooden box containing their mother's ashes under the paper mulberry tree in their front yard, which to the Tillermans is important to the family because of its fragility and beauty.|$|R
5|$|While {{most of the}} LNC's {{business}} was now operated by road, an agreement on 13 May 1946 allowed the LNC {{to make use of}} SR services from Waterloo to Brookwood station for funerals, subject to the condition that should the service be heavily used the SR (British Railways after 1948) reserved the right to restrict the number of funeral parties on any given train. Although one of the LNC's hearse carriages had survived the bombing it is unlikely that this was ever used, and coffins were carried in the luggage space of the SR's coaches. Coffins would either be shipped to Brookwood ahead of the <b>funeral</b> party and <b>transported</b> by road to one of the mortuaries at the disused cemetery stations, or travel on the same SR train as the funeral party to Brookwood and be transported from Brookwood station to the burial site or chapel by road.|$|R
50|$|Mencken and Nathan’s editorship at The Smart Set {{came to an}} end {{after they}} planned to run a satirical piece on President Warren G. Harding {{following}} his death. Harding died in August 1923. His <b>funeral</b> procession involved <b>transporting</b> the body across the country from San Francisco to Ohio. The mainstream media began to sentimentalize the procession, to the dismay of American intellectuals, who noticed a hypocritical change in the press’s attitude. Among the dissatisfied were Mencken and Nathan. The two co-editors planned to run a satirical piece on the president’s funeral, treating the president in death as they did in life. However, the magazine’s printers noticed the piece and reported its contents to an incensed Warner. Considering the piece to be a form of treason, Warner demanded that the editors remove it and, in a rage, announced that he was selling the magazine. Warner’s removal of their satirical piece marked the end of the editors' carte blanche over the magazine’s content, and they sought the freedom and control over their own publication. Upon leaving, the two Mencken and Nathan began a collaboration with the publishing magnate Alfred A. Knopf and started The American Mercury.|$|R
50|$|The {{most recent}} state funeral for an {{individual}} other than a president was for General of the Army Douglas MacArthur in 1964. President John F. Kennedy had authorized a state funeral for MacArthur and President Lyndon B. Johnson confirmed Kennedy's directive. Funeral plans drawn up in 1958 called for seven days rather than four days of ceremonial events. When MacArthur died on April 5, 1964 at Walter Reed Army Hospital, his remains were transported to New York City where he lay in repose at the Seventh Regiment Armory. Mounted city police from the New York City Police Department, soldiers from the First Army, and cadets from the United States Military Academy participated in the funeral procession on Park Avenue, 66th Street, 57th Street, Fifth Avenue, Broadway and Seventh Avenue en route to Pennsylvania Station. A <b>funeral</b> train <b>transported</b> MacArthur's remains from New York to Union Station in Washington, D.C. A funeral procession on both Pennsylvania and Constitution Avenues using a horse-drawn caisson took the General's remains to the Capitol for lying in state. Over {{the course of two}} days, April 8-9, over 150,000 people filed past MacArthur's casket in the Capitol rotunda. A third funeral procession occurred on Constitution Avenue that included a flyover of fifty Air Force planes over the column in salute as the horse-drawn caisson neared the site of the casket transfer to a hearse. MacArthur's remains were then transported to Washington National Airport and flown to Naval Station Norfolk on a Lockheed C-130 Hercules. A fourth funeral procession occurred in the streets of Norfolk, stopping at the MacArthur Memorial where lying in repose occurred in the rotunda from April 9-11. After a religious service was held at St. Paul's Episcopal Church on April 11 in Norfolk for an invited 400 guests, a fifth and final horse-drawn procession back to the MacArthur Memorial occurred. A three-volley salute, the folding of the flag, and a 19-gun salute accorded to a five-star rank of general, which MacArthur possessed, was fired before burial in a crypt.|$|R

The competitive nature of funeral processions got so out of hand, that the emperor had to issue imperial edicts to regulate the quantity and size of tomb figurines, according to the deceased’s social status. Tomb artefacts were meant to glorify its deceased master and the master’s living family.|$|R
25|$|Miller was rested for {{the match}} against Derbyshire {{immediately}} after the First Test, a rain-affected match that ended in a draw. Australia then travelled to Bramall Lane in Sheffield under the captaincy of Miller. Captain Hassett and his deputy Arthur Morris were rested from the match and stayed in London with the team manager. Miller bowled only one over after Yorkshire won the toss due to his sore rib. Nevertheless, after the first day's play, he organised a party for his young team that lasted until the next afternoonthe rest day. Miller and Lindwall, the two most senior players present, were the last to leave. They woke up with a hangover {{on the following day}} just minutes before play was to start in front of a packed stadium of 30,000. With no transport available, a journalist hired a hearse from a nearby <b>funeral</b> home to <b>transport</b> the pacemen to the ground. They arrived just in time and Yorkshire went on to finish at 377, Lindwall taking four of the last five wickets despite his hangover. When it was Australia's turn to bat, Miller rearranged his batting order to allow him more time to recover. As a result, with regular opener Colin McDonald absent hurt, Ian Craig and wicket-keeper Don Tallon opened the batting, but both were dismissed cheaply, for 19 and a duck respectively. However, Graeme Hole (71) and Harvey (69) consolidated the innings, and Miller came in at 3/128 and was the last man to be dismissed, having scored 86 from 195 minutes despite his hangover. He had been dropped five times during his innings, which helped Australia to avoid the follow on and end at 323. Having taken a 54-run first innings lead, Yorkshire reached 3/220 in their second innings and the match was drawn. Miller injury had improved and he took 0/40 in the second innings from 15 overs.|$|R
