But we all want peace, and I would be glad to move all my people down this way; I could then keep them all quietly near camp.

Carradine said he even sold his Kung Fu residuals to raise money for his own projects, and consequently gone into debt. [...] He also sought advice from directors he had worked with, including Martin Scorsese and Ingmar Bergman. [...] "The wonderful thing about working with good directors, Carradine admitted, is it gives me the opportunity to pick their brains <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> films."

Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens allied himself with director Joe Johnston and production manager Ian Bryce {{in an effort to}} be as heavily involved in the production process as possible and to try and secure as much artistic control as he could from Disney. Disney, in particular, was not enthusiastic with Stevens' involvement. [...] "I was on the set day and night", Stevens reflected, [...] "from pre-production till post-production! And initially, I had to fight to prove that I was there {{for the benefit of the}} film, and not <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> ego." ...|$|E

He presented a cheque of [...] 50,000 to YRG Care Centre, which helps AIDS affected children. In 2011, Karthi became a cause ambassador for promoting awareness of lysosomal storage disease. He had also adopted a white tiger cub at Vandalur Zoo and contributed [...] 72,000 to protect and preserve the animal. On his birthdays, Karthi visits orphanages and donates funds to them. He told Indiaglitz; [...] "When I see people in need, I make sure I go and help. If I am going on birthdays to reach out to kids in orphanages, it is <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> satisfaction.

He said that the murder had {{happened}} in Southampton the previous year and [...] "that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day, and subsequently wrote a note which stated: [...] "After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that it was me that was dead and not the person I killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ...

500|$|The Rhoads' letter created one of {{the first}} crises for James Beverley, newly {{appointed}} as the acting Governor of Puerto Rico. He said the letter was a [...] "confession of murder" [...] and [...] "a libel against the people of Puerto Rico", and ordered an investigation, one of his first acts. Beverley said of Rhoads that [...] "he was just a damned fool, ... a good doctor, but not very strong mentally on anything else." [...] Rhoads, already back in New York, released an official response to the media and the governor. He insisted that he was joking in his letter, which was intended to be confidential, calling it a [...] "fantastic and playful composition written entirely <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> diversion and intended as a parody on supposed attitudes of some American minds in Porto Rico," [...] explaining that nothing [...] "was ever intended to mean other than the opposite of what was stated." [...] Rhoads offered to return to clear things up, but never did. The governor's inquiry concluded that Rhoads did not commit the acts included in his letter, nor any other crimes.|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the methods}} that Playford used were {{described}} by economic conservatives as 'socialism', drawing opposition from within his own party, especially in the Legislative Council. It is even said that the Liberal leader in that chamber—Sir Collier Cudmore—once referred to Playford as a 'Bolshevik'. The unique economic intervention earned Playford scorn from his own colleagues, but the Labor movement was much more receptive. Indeed, Labor leader Mick O'Halloran would dine with Playford {{on a weekly basis}} to discuss the development of the state, and the pair were on close personal terms. At a dinner party, O'Halloran remarked that [...] "I wouldn't want to be Premier even if I could be. Tom Playford can often do more <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> voters than I could if I were in his shoes." [...] O'Halloran's lack of ambition was mocked in a political cartoon, but the Labor leader took the piece as a compliment and had it framed and put on display. As Playford had more opposition from his LCL colleagues in the upper house than Labor, O'Halloran was often described as the premier's 'junior partner". Playford called Labor [...] "our Opposition", in comparison to opponents in his party, which he decried as being [...] "critical without being helpful". This cooperative nature of party politics would not change until Don Dunstan's prominence in the late 1950s, when Playford would be assailed not for his economics, but for his government's comparatively low expenditure on public services such as education and healthcare.|$|E

500|$|In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) {{approached}} Gardner {{and asked}} him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s", although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years. With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed {{an increase in the number}} of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing [...] "pants", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa. James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were [...] "dogged by silliness", giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where [...] "Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher". Whilst Gardner's Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics, they were popular and a number appeared in The New York Times Best Seller list, bringing the author commercial success. Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author, once saying that [...] "I'm very grateful to have been selected to keep Bond alive. But I'd much rather be remembered <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> work than I would for Bond", while saying on another occasion that [...] "I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development". In the mid-1990s, after discovering he had esophageal cancer, Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond.|$|E
500|$|Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily {{acknowledges}} {{the influence of}} Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally ( [...] ; [...] ). Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the [...] "technical and speculative innovations" [...] of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter , they nevertheless produced a [...] "sharp emotion, {{the result of a}} beneficial shock engendered by their boldness" [...] and provided [...] "an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) <b>for</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> investigations" [...] While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it. Retrospectively, it is clear that from this confusion was born my interest for the formal questions which remain until today. [...] With respect to Stockhausen's later work, he said, I have never subscribed (whatever the inevitable personal distance) to the thesis according to which the many transformations of vocabulary characterizing Stockhausen's development are the obvious sign of his inability to carry out the early vision of strict order that he had in his youth. On the contrary, {{it seems to me that}} the constant reconsideration of his premises has led to the maintenance of a remarkably tough thread of historical consciousness which will become clearer with time[...] [...] [...] I doubt that there has been a single composer of the intervening generation who, even if for a short time, did not see the world of music differently thanks to the work of Stockhausen. [...] In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that [...] "Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course" [...] and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum [...]|$|E
