In downtown Fairbanks, overcrowding, traffic problems, and drunken rambunctiousness caused by pipeline workers pushed businesses to move into malls built away from downtown. New commercial centers like Gavora Mall, Bentley Mall, and others {{away from the city}} center drove the construction of freeways that bypassed downtown Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for the worse. The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} to play for Auckland until 1913. This period included two more matches against international opposition: a victory over the 1908 Anglo-Welsh side 11–0, and a defeat of Australia in 1913. Auckland had held the Ranfurly Shield throughout this time, and <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> a number of close shield challenges during their reign. They had 23 successful shield defenses before they faced Taranaki on 16 August 1913. In the match Taranaki scored a converted try (worth five points at the time) four minutes from full-time to end Auckland's shield reign. Cunningham had played in 16 of Auckland's 24 shield matches during their tenure. He retired from provincial rugby {{at the end of}} that season.|$|E

5|$|James Vanderbilt {{had read}} Robert Graysmith's book Zodiac in 1986 while in high school. Years later, after {{becoming}} a screenwriter, {{he got the}} opportunity to meet Graysmith, and became fascinated by the folklore surrounding the Zodiac Killer. He then decided to try to translate the story into a script. Vanderbilt <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> bad experiences in the past, in which the endings of his scripts had been changed, and wanted to have more control over the material this time. He pitched his adaptation of Zodiac to Mike Medavoy and Bradley J. Fischer from Phoenix Pictures, by agreeing to write a spec script if he could have more creative control over it.|$|E
5|$|Once Adrienne was {{released}} from prison in France, she, with the help of U.S. Minister to France James Monroe, obtained passports for her and her daughters from Connecticut, which had granted the entire Lafayette family citizenship. Her son Georges Washington had been smuggled out of France and taken to the United States. Adrienne and her two daughters journeyed to Vienna for an audience with Emperor Francis, who granted permission for the three women to live with Lafayette in captivity. Lafayette, who <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> harsh solitary confinement since his escape attempt a year before, was astounded when soldiers opened his prison door to usher in his wife and daughters on 15 October 1795. The family spent the next two years in confinement together.|$|E

The Bears <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> several losing seasons after the {{retirement}} of the iconic Gale Sayers in 1972. Payton's first game was not particularly successful; he was held to zero net rushing yards on eight attempts. His best performance of the season was the final game against the New Orleans Saints, where he rushed for 134 yards on 20 carries. Payton finished the season with only 679 yards and seven touchdowns. However, Payton led the league in yards per kickoff return.|$|E

The flight on 3 September 1978, Sunday afternoon, from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, {{most of whom were}} holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake. The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the next}} years, Lafayette made his house, the Hôtel de La Fayette in Paris's rue de Bourbon, the {{headquarters}} of Americans there. Benjamin Franklin, John and Sarah Jay, and John and Abigail Adams met there every Monday, and dined in company with Lafayette's family and the liberal nobility, including Clermont-Tonnerre and Madame de Staël. Lafayette continued to work on lowering trade barriers in France to American goods, and on assisting Franklin and his successor as envoy, Jefferson, in seeking treaties of amity and commerce with European nations. He also sought to eliminate the injustices that Protestants in France <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> since the revocation of the Edict of Nantes a century before.|$|E

5|$|Diarra {{also participated}} in European {{competition}} with Bordeaux during the season. He played in four matches during the club's UEFA Cup campaign. Bordeaux reached the Round of 32 where the club was eliminated by Belgian club Anderlecht on a 3–2 aggregate scoreline. In the Coupe de France, Bordeaux reached the quarter-finals. Diarra appeared in all four matches the team contested, which included playing 120 minutes in back-to-back rounds. He scored two more goals for the club; both of which came {{in the league in}} wins over Metz and Rennes. Bordeaux finished the season in second place; four points behind the champions Lyon. It was the closest gap Lyon <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> since the 2003–04 season when the club won the league by three points over Paris Saint-Germain. Diarra finished the season with 44 total appearances and four goals.|$|E
5|$|In June, {{during a}} brief period away from the line in billets, the battalion, {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Brigade, was {{reviewed}} by the Australian prime minister, Billy Hughes near Fleurbaix. Following this, although several units from I Anzac Corps took part in a number of raids against the German line during late June and early July, the 2nd Battalion was not involved and as such, apart from experiencing some enemy shelling, the 2nd Battalion's first significant action came at Pozières in July 1916. The battalion entered the line on the night of 19/20 July as the 1st was sent forward to relieve the British 68th Brigade along with the 3rd Brigade; just after midnight the 2nd Battalion, after an approach march over which they <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> gas attack, arrived at its position opposite the south-western side of the village.|$|E
5|$|In the First Balkan War, fought from October 1912 to May 1913, Pećanac was mobilised in the Serbian Third Army, {{holding the}} rank of {{sergeant}} in the Morava Division.

During the Second Balkan War, fought from 29 June to 10 August 1913, Pećanac {{is believed to have been}} stationed at the front at Kitka on Osogovo Mountain along the Zletovska and Bregalnica rivers. There, his division took part in the Battle of Bregalnica with the Bulgarians. After the Bulgarian attacks failed, they sent parliamentarians to seek a truce, but the Serbian side refused and the fighting continued.

During the mission {{he and his}} {{companion}} were intercepted by Polikarpov I-16 Rata fighters, and Dubovac downed one of the attackers over the city of Tuapse to register his first confirmed aerial victory. Dukovac was unable to build upon his success at this time, as four days later the whole Staffel rotated back to the NDH {{because most of the}} personnel <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> a year of constant combat. The men of 15./JG 52 had a break of three months, commencing their return journey on 12 February 1943, collecting their aircraft at Kraków in German-occupied Poland on 18 February then flying to Lvov. They flew on to Nikolayev on 21 February. The Eastern Front had changed significantly during their absence, with the strategic initiative passing to the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|The century {{following}} 1750 {{was time}} of significant change. New forms of transport, industry and agriculture brought sweeping changes, {{and an end}} to traditional ways of life that <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> for centuries. The aftermath of the Battle of Culloden {{marked the beginning of the}} end for the clan system and whilst there were marked improvements in living standards for some, these transformations came at a cost for others. In the early 19th century Alexander, 10th Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852) embarked on a programme of clearances that had a devastating effect on Arran's population. Whole villages were removed and the Gaelic culture of the island dealt a terminal blow. A memorial to this early form of ethnic cleansing has been constructed on the shore at Lamlash, paid for by a Canadian descendant of the emigrants.|$|E
5|$|The convoys {{of wounded}} were met {{a few miles}} from El Arish by {{infantry}} with sandcarts lent by the 52nd (Lowland) Division, so the wounded who <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> the cacolets travelled in comfort to the receiving station, arriving at 04:00 on 25 December. The 52nd (Lowland) Division supplied medical stores and personnel to assist, but although arrangements were made for evacuation to the railhead two days later, evacuation by sea was planned. This had to be postponed due to a gale with rain and hail on 27 December and it was not until 29 December that the largest single ambulance convoy organised in the campaign, 77 sandcarts, nine sledges and a number of cacolet camels, moved out in three lines along the beach with 150 wounded. A few serious cases, who had not been ready to be moved, were evacuated the following day to begin their journey to Kantara on the Suez Canal.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, the Japanese {{called a}} halt to their attack on the Australian right, and subsequently troops from the 2/28th Infantry Battalion were then sent to the east to secure the position's flanks. On 29 November, the 2/32nd was relieved by the 2/43rd. In doing so, it {{was struck by a}} heavy Japanese artillery bombardment which killed or wounded25. Over the 10days that the 2/32nd had held Pabu, Mollard's force <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> repeated mortar and artillery fire, and repeated attacks, but with the assistance of strong artillery support, it had held its ground and in doing so had helped blunt the force of the Japanese counterattack at a time when Australian forces were making heavy progress towards the Japanese fortress at Sattelberg. Later, the Japanese commanding general, Adachi, pinpointed the Australian capture of Pabu as {{one of the main reasons}} for the defeat of his force during the Huon Peninsula campaign. Losses during the fighting around Pabu were 195Japanese and 25Australians killed, and 51 Australians wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} historians {{of the outcome}} of the battle changed {{with the passage of time}} and the {{changing}} political situations surrounding them. Kutuzov proclaimed a victory both to the army and to Emperor Alexander. While many a general throughout history claimed victory out of defeat (Ramses II of Egypt did so) and in this case, Kutuzov was the one man to whom the entire Russian Army could give its allegiance, but it was an army that, despite the huge losses, considered itself undefeated. Announcing a defeat would have removed Kutuzov from his command, and further damaged an army that <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> much and still stood proud. While Alexander was not deceived by the announcement, it gave him the justification needed to allow Kutuzov to march his army off to rebuild the Russian forces and later complete the near utter destruction of the French army. As such, what was said by Kutuzov and those supporting his views was allowed to pass into the histories of the time unchecked.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} against the Gepids, Alboin {{had failed to}} greatly {{increase}} his power, and was now faced with a much stronger threat from the Avars. Historians consider this the decisive factor in convincing Alboin to undertake a migration, {{even though there are}} indications that before the war with the Gepids a decision was maturing to leave for Italy, a country thousands of Lombards had seen in the 550s when hired by the Byzantines to fight in the Gothic War. Additionally, the Lombards would have known of the weakness of Byzantine Italy, which <b>had</b> <b>endured</b> a number of problems after being retaken from the Goths. In particular the so-called Plague of Justinian had ravaged the region and conflict remained endemic, with the Three-Chapter Controversy sparking religious opposition and administration at a standstill after the able governor of the peninsula, Narses, was recalled. Nevertheless, the Lombards viewed Italy as a rich land which promised great booty, assets Alboin used to gather together a horde which included not only Lombards but many other peoples of the region, including Heruli, Suebi, Gepids, Thuringii, Bulgars, Sarmatians, the remaining Romans and a few Ostrogoths. But the most important group, other than the Lombards, were the Saxons, of whom 20,000 male warriors with their families participated in the trek. These Saxons were tributaries to the Frankish King Sigebert, and their participation indicates that Alboin had the support of the Franks for his venture.|$|E
