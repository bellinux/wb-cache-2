25|$|Rough {{membership}} primarily {{differs from}} the <b>fuzzy</b> membership in that the membership of union and intersection of sets cannot, in general, be computed from their constituent membership {{as is the case}} of <b>fuzzy</b> sets. In this, rough membership is a generalization of <b>fuzzy</b> membership. Furthermore, the rough membership function is grounded more in probability than the conventionally held concepts of the <b>fuzzy</b> membership function.|$|E
25|$|Interest in <b>fuzzy</b> systems was {{sparked by}} Seiji Yasunobu and Soji Miyamoto of Hitachi, who in 1985 {{provided}} simulations that demonstrated {{the feasibility of}} <b>fuzzy</b> control systems for the Sendai railway. Their ideas were adopted, and <b>fuzzy</b> systems were used to control accelerating, braking, and stopping when the line opened in 1987.|$|E

It was the {{friendly}} nature of the <b>Fuzzies</b> that got on their nerves and they hated the new name of the island.The demons came up with a cunning plan to get rid of the existence and therefore the good mood of the <b>Fuzzies.</b> They invited the <b>Fuzzies</b> to one of the biggest party that had ever been celebrated on the island. The <b>Fuzzies</b> could of course not resist this invitation. They cleaned their fur and they all went to the party. But when the party was at its best, these nasty demons threw a net over the <b>Fuzzies,</b> captured them and locked them all up in their torture chambers.|$|R

25|$|Japanese {{engineers}} subsequently {{developed a}} wide range of <b>fuzzy</b> systems for both industrial and consumer applications. In 1988 Japan established the Laboratory for International <b>Fuzzy</b> Engineering (LIFE), a cooperative arrangement between 48 companies to pursue <b>fuzzy</b> research.

2500|$|Since the {{development}} of rough sets, extensions and generalizations have continued to evolve. Initial developments focused on the relationship - both similarities and difference - with <b>fuzzy</b> sets. While some literature contends these concepts are different, other literature considers that rough sets are a generalization of <b>fuzzy</b> sets - as represented through either <b>fuzzy</b> rough sets or rough <b>fuzzy</b> sets. [...] Pawlak (1995) considered that <b>fuzzy</b> and rough sets {{should be treated as}} being complementary to each other, addressing different aspects of uncertainty and vagueness.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{appearance}} there are several difficulties to give a rigorous logical interpretation of the IF-THEN rules. As an example, interpret a rule as [...] IF (temperature is [...] "cold") THEN (heater is [...] "high") by the first order formula Cold(x)→High(y) and assume that r is an input such that Cold(r) is false. Then the formula Cold(r)→High(t) is true for any t and therefore any t gives a correct control given r. A rigorous logical justification of <b>fuzzy</b> control is given in Hájek's book (see Chapter 7) where <b>fuzzy</b> control is represented as a theory of Hájek's basic logic. Also in Gerla 2005 [...] another logical approach to <b>fuzzy</b> control is proposed based on <b>fuzzy</b> logic programming.Indeed, denote by f the <b>fuzzy</b> function arising of an IF-THEN systems of rules. Then we can translate this system into a <b>fuzzy</b> program P containing a series of rules whose head is [...] "Good(x,y)". The interpretation of this predicate in the least <b>fuzzy</b> Herbrand model of P coincides with f. This gives further useful tools to <b>fuzzy</b> control.|$|E
