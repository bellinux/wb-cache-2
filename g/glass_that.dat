5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, especially if the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. <b>Glass</b> <b>that</b> has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} {{increased to}} about 20,000 as Serb refugees {{from other parts}} of Croatia and Bosnia were relocated by RSK authorities. They initially lived without water or electricity, in damaged buildings patched up with plastic sheeting and wooden boards. Residents scavenged the ruins for fragments of <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> they could stick back together to make windows for themselves. The main sources of income were war profiteering and smuggling, though some were able to find jobs in eastern Slavonia's revived oil industry. Reconstruction was greatly delayed by economic sanctions and lack of international aid.|$|E
5|$|St Gwenllwyfo's Church is a 19th-century parish church {{near the}} village of Dulas, in Anglesey, north Wales. It was built between 1854 and 1856 to replace an earlier church in the parish, also {{dedicated}} to St Gwenllwyfo, which needed repair and had become too small for its congregation. The new church was built nearer to the Llys Dulas estate, whose owner contributed £936 towards the total cost of £1,417, rather than near the area where many of the parishioners lived. In 1876, Sir Arundell Neave (who had married into the family that owned Llys Dulas) donated 27 panels of 15th and 16th-century stained <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> had once belonged to a Flemish monastery.|$|E

5|$|The {{design that}} Pei {{developed}} for the Bank of China Tower was not only unique in appearance, but also sound enough to pass the city's rigorous standards for wind-resistance. The tower was planned around a visible truss structure, which distributed stress to {{the four corners of}} the base. Using the reflective <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> had become something of a trademark for him, Pei organized the facade around a series of boxed X shapes. At the top, he designed the roofs at sloping angles to match the rising aesthetic of the building. Some influential advocates of feng shui in Hong Kong and China criticized the design, and Pei and government officials responded with token adjustments.|$|E

25|$|In recent years, {{tungsten}} trioxide has been {{employed in the}} production of electrochromic windows, or smart windows.

25|$|Thin-film linear polarizers are glass {{substrates}} {{on which}} a special optical coating is applied. Either Brewster's angle reflections or interference effects in the film cause them to act as beam-splitting polarizers. The substrate for the film can either be a plate, which is inserted into the beam at a particular angle, or a wedge of <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> is cemented to a second wedge to form a cube with the film cutting diagonally across the center (one form {{of this is the}} very common MacNeille cube).|$|E
25|$|As a novel glass forming {{technique}} {{created in}} the middle of the 1st century BC, glassblowing exploited a working property of <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> was previously unknown to glassworkers, inflation, the expansion of a molten blob of glass by introducing a small amount of air to it. That is based on the liquid structure of glass where the atoms are held together by strong chemical bonds in a disordered and random network, therefore molten glass is viscous enough to be blown and gradually hardens as it loses heat.|$|E
25|$|Cameo {{glass was}} invented by the Romans in about 30BC to imitate {{engraved}} hardstone cameos, with the advantage that consistent layering could be achieved even on round vessels – impossible with natural gemstones. It was however very difficult to manufacture and surviving pieces, mostly famously the Portland Vase, are actually much rarer than Roman gemstone cameos. The technique was revived in the 18th and especially 19th centuries in England and elsewhere, and was most effectively used in French Art Nouveau <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> {{made no attempt to}} follow classical styles.|$|E

25|$|Again September 1997 saw a new look, with {{fragments}} of glass flying and a sequence utilising footage of medical staff, hospital equipment and patients' relatives. The sequence ends {{as all the}} pieces of <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> were shattered {{in the first few}} seconds of the sequence are re-formed into a single pane, which spells out the new Casual+y logo. Minor edits were made when these titles were shortened towards the end of 1998 for series 13 but they remained essentially the same until series 14 ended in March 2000.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 10,000 years ago, the Tahltan people, who {{now live in}} Dease Lake, Telegraph Creek and the Iskut, used {{obsidian}} from Mount Edziza to make tools and weapons for trading material. This is {{the main source of}} obsidian found in northwestern British Columbia, which was traded as far away as Alaska and northern Alberta. Obsidian is a type of naturally occurring <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> is highly valued for its cutting qualities. Like all glass and some other types of naturally occurring rocks, obsidian breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, creating razor sharp edges.|$|E
25|$|Soda-lime-silica glass, window glass: silica + {{sodium oxide}} (Na2O) + lime (CaO) + {{magnesia}} (MgO) + alumina (Al2O3). Is transparent, easily formed and {{most suitable for}} window glass (see flat glass). It has a high thermal expansion and poor resistance to heat (500–600°C). It is used for windows, some low-temperature incandescent light bulbs, and tableware. Container glass is a soda-lime <b>glass</b> <b>that</b> is a slight variation on flat glass, which uses more alumina and calcium, and less sodium and magnesium, which are more water-soluble. This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.|$|E
