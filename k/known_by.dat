40|$|With a {{point of}} {{departure}} in a transactional understanding of epistemology, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to explore practical epistemologies in PE by investigating how knowledge is produced and reproduced in students’ and teachers’ actions in PE practices posted as clips on the user-generated video sharing website YouTube. YouTube can be understood as a disordered public video archive of (in this case) ongoing PE practices created by both students and teachers.  With a transactional understanding, knowing, and in consequence questions of epistemology, can be conceived of as something we do; something practical (Dewey & Bentley 1949). In this paper, practical epistemologies in PE are, in line with Dewey (1938, 1941), investigated by exploring ends-in-view and habits-of-action in students’ and teachers’ actions in PE practice.  The practical epistemologies identified in the study are: (i) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> doing correct movements, (ii) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> trying, (iii) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> imitating, (iv) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> praising and cheering, (v) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> cooperating, (vi) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> creating, (vii) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> being changed into gym clothes, (viii) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> acting in a certain locality and (ix) <b>Knowing</b> <b>by</b> resisting. The categories represent different ways of how knowledge is produced and reproduced in PE practice and describe the functions that different actions and actors have in how knowledge is produced and reproduced as well as in the direction this takes...|$|R
