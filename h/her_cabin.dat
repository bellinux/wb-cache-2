Afterwards, the Council convenes again to discuss the development and construction of a new bio-weapon, a project helped by Archer's bio-data that was stolen by Rajiin.|$|E
5|$|Burnham {{was born}} on May 11, 1861 on a Dakota Sioux Indian {{reservation}} in Minnesota, to a missionary family living near the small pioneer town of Tivoli (now gone), about 20 miles (32km) from Mankato. His father, the Reverend Edwin Otway Burnham, was a Presbyterian minister educated and ordained in New York; {{he was born in}} Ghent, Kentucky. His mother Rebecca Russell Burnham had spent most of her childhood in Iowa, having emigrated with her family from Westminster, England at the age of three. In the Dakota War of 1862, Chief Little Crow and his Sioux warriors attacked the nearby town New Ulm, Minnesota; Burnham's father was in Mankato buying ammunition at the time, so when Burnham's mother saw Sioux approaching <b>her</b> <b>cabin</b> dressed in war paint, she knew she had to leave and could never escape carrying her baby. She hid Frederick in a basket of green corn husks in a corn field and fled for her life. Once the Sioux attack had been repulsed, she returned to find their house burned down, but the baby Frederick was safe, fast asleep in the basket with the corn husks.|$|E

5000|$|After Molter's death, <b>her</b> <b>cabins</b> were {{dismantled}} {{and moved}} to Ely, as the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act of 1978 banned permanent residences and structures within the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. The {{first part of the}} effort involved transporting the disassembled cabins by dog sled to a landing point at the Boy Scout canoe base on Moose lake. [...] Time was of the essence as the Forest Service was directed to burn <b>her</b> <b>cabins</b> down by a certain date. An unseasonably warm March stymied those efforts to move <b>her</b> <b>cabins</b> by dogsled and special permission was obtained to use motorized transportation such as snowmobiles. Her residence was re-erected {{on the east side of}} Ely, Minnesota on a site near the Chamber of Commerce building.|$|R

25|$|During the Battle of Galveston, Harriet Lane sank the Rebel tugboat Neptune, leaving {{one-half}} of the two-vessel Confederate fleet lying {{on the bottom of}} the harbor. However, the Confederate gunboat Bayou City circled and made a second run on Harriet Lane.

During the negotiations, Harriet Lane was further damaged by fire from the Union Owasco under a flag of truce in an attempt to explode her magazine.

25|$|Halfway {{across the}} sea the Roland strikes an unseen object which causes massive {{flooding}} and dooms the ship. The passengers panic as the ship sinks into the Atlantic. Von Kammacher finds Ingigered passed out in <b>her</b> <b>cabin</b> from shock and carries her to a lifeboat. He goes back and searches in vain her father but when he can't find him, von Kammacher returns to the lifeboat and holds Ingigereds hand as the lifeboat pulls away. They watch in horror as the Roland sinks into the ocean. The liner sinks so rapidly {{that many of the}} lifeboats are never launched and several passengers are swept into the sea and drowned. By morning, only von Kammachers lifeboat is still floating (the rest having been swamped by swimmers) and 8 still alive. They are spotted by a cargo liner and saved. Ingigerd is devastated when she is told that there are no more survivors and both her father and boyfriend have drowned.|$|E

He realised that the diamonds were probably still on the Kilmorden Castle. Anne confirms that they were, and were handed to Suzanne in <b>her</b> <b>cabin</b> {{on the night of the}} 22nd. Harry's island is attacked that night by a party led by the red-bearded Dutchman, but the two manage to escape, and Anne plans to return to Pedler's party where she can keep an eye on developments.

25|$|In {{addition}} to being the largest and fastest ship of her time, Finnjet is also widely considered {{to have been the}} first genuine cruiseferry. <b>Her</b> <b>cabins</b> were very much ahead of their time for a ferry, it was not until over a decade later when other ferries would match the size and fittings of Finnjet 's <b>cabins.</b> <b>Her</b> restaurants and other services were also superior to other ferries of her time.

500|$|The {{pastoral}} Epistles, too, {{give the}} impression of being in real places, with flesh-and-blood people, at specific times of day. Epistle 48 tells how the friends return to Stockholm by boat after a night out on Lake Mälaren, one summer morning in 1769. Each of its twenty-one verses paints a picture of a moment in the peaceful journey, from the wind stirring the fallen sails, the skipper's daughter coming out of <b>her</b> <b>cabin,</b> the cockerel crowing, the church clock striking four in the morning, the sun glimmering on the calm water. The effects may seem to be haphazard, but [...] "each stanza is a little picture, framed by its melody. We remember it all, seem to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." [...] Britten Austin calls it [...] "a new vision of the natural and urban scene. Fresh as Martin's. Detailed as Hogarth's. Frail and ethereal as Watteau's." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} {{assembly}} cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In {{the original version}} of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at {{the stern of the}} boat and fear she is going to commit suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to <b>her</b> <b>cabin</b> to sleep, whereupon the film ends {{in the same way as}} the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the Titanic sinking.|$|E

[...] After this, Celia attempted to plead with Newsom’s family members and with Newsom himself. Sometime on or around June 23, 1855, Celia begged Newsom to leave her alone because she was sick and pregnant. Newsom refused, and told her “he was coming down to <b>her</b> <b>cabin</b> that night.” Celia threatened Newsom, telling him that she would hurt him if he tried to rape her again.
