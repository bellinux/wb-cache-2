After the move the structure is lowered reversing the steps just applied.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- An inbuilt {{hydraulic}} <b>jack</b> <b>system</b> {{is attached}} to automobile vehicle on front and rear par of the chassis. An automobile hydraulic <b>jack</b> <b>system</b> can be easily attached to all currently manufacture automobile chassis and frames. There is a front suspension hydraulic jack that is mounted centrally to the front suspension of an automobile between its front wheels. There is also a rear suspension hydraulic jack that is mounted centrally to the rear suspension of the automobile between its rear wheels. The system operates from a compressed fluid reservoir tank that has connections for {{the front and rear}} car jack outlets. Additional outlets can be added to the compressed fluid reservoir tank for connecting a hydraulic lug wrench and another for a tire inflating hose. The Major Project entitled “Inbuilt hydraulic jack in automobile vehicle ” Worked on the principal of hydraulic power and operated by 12 Volt DC current, solves the all major problem of maintenance of all automobiles specially the heavy vehicles like truck and bus. This work, if implemented, would definitely help in the maintenance of automobiles and also in saving of time. I...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Jack</b> human {{simulation}} <b>system</b> {{was developed}} at the Center for Human Modeling and Simulation at the University of Pennsylvania in the 1980s & 1990s. Conceived as an ergonomic assessment and virtual human prototyping system for NASA space shuttle development, it soon gathered funding from the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army for dismounted soldier simulation, from the U.S. Air Force for maintenance simulation, and from various other government and corporate users for their own applications. In 1996 the software was spun off into a privately held company and is now sold as an ergonomic human simulation toolkit (called Tecnomatix Jack) by Siemens. The {{research and development of}} the <b>Jack</b> <b>system</b> have led to such standards as H-anim and MPEG4 Body Animation Parameters.|$|R
50|$|The car used a tuned {{version of}} the six {{cylinder}} 2062 cc Morris QPHG engine which it shared with the Wolseley Super Six but enlarged to 2288 cc. The capacity was increased again to 2322 cc in 1937 bringing it into line with the Wolseley 18. This was a tall engine and to allow the bonnet line to be {{as low as possible}} the twin SU carburettors had their dashpots mounted horizontally. Drive was to the live rear axle via a four speed manual gearbox with synchromesh on the top two ratios (on all but a few early models). Wire wheels were fitted and the drum brakes were hydraulically operated using a Lockheed system. A built in Jackall <b>jacking</b> <b>system</b> was fitted to the chassis.|$|E
50|$|The SB {{launched}} at the October 1933 London Motor Show {{had a new}} cruciform braced chassis, {{slightly longer}} at 124 in, with independent front suspension using a single transverse leaf spring with a long solid anchorage in the centre. Steering was improved using new designs employed for racing Alvis cars since 1925. Road shocks were not transmitted from one wheel to the other nor did they affect {{the steering wheel and}} the gyroscopic effect was eliminated. Rear springs damped by Hartford Telecontrol dampers are long and underslung. The engine remained the same but the new all-silent gearbox, the first of its type, gained synchromesh on bottom gear and was mounted separately from the engine. A built-in <b>jacking</b> <b>system</b> was fitted as standard.|$|E
50|$|The KLG Sparking Plug {{distribution}} {{rights were}} purchased from Kenelm Lee Guinness in 1919. The British Jaeger Instrument Company was purchased in 1927 {{as was the}} KLG Sparking Plug Company (Robinhood Engineering). The Jackall hydraulic <b>jacking</b> <b>system</b> was manufactured from 1935 by Smith's Jacking Systems and immediately became standard equipment in many popular cars. In 1937 a separate aircraft and marine department {{was created in the}} parent company and named Smiths Aircraft Instruments. It operated with Smiths subsidiary Henry Hughes and Son manufacturers of aircraft and marine instruments. In 1946, Smiths and the Ingersoll Watch Company founded the Anglo-Celtic Watch Co. Ltd., which produced watches in Wales. This became one of the largest producers of watches in Europe before closing in 1980.|$|E

Uniform loading is applied by inflating a 15 -mm thick by 100 -mm wide hard rubber pad, which is confined by the top surface of the test slab. A steel plate with 10 -mm thick by 100 -mm wide is placed {{on the top of the}} pad.|$|R
50|$|Optional extras were a luggage rack, chrome bumpers and Stevenson <b>Jacking</b> <b>system.</b> The {{upholstery}} was {{leather cloth}} with leather seating. The only known Super 9 to have Bedford Cord throughout is the prototype; this {{also has a}} smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures, but is not seen on any production 9’s. Instruments consisted of a speedometer, clock, oil gauge and ammeter. After 1931 a petrol gauge was added, prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply. Dash switches consisted of, a dash light, interior light, ignition, and a starter button, also choke and fast running control. External lights switching, battery charge rate, and ignition timing were all at {{the centre of the}} steering wheel.|$|E
5000|$|Whilst it used a {{brand new}} 4-cylinder 2199 cc, overhead-valve engine—the first {{to be used in}} an Austin car, it in fact used the chassis and body of the pre-war Austin 12, which {{continued}} to be produced, alongside the other pre-war saloons the 8 hp and the 10 hp. The number Sixteen was not an indication of the actual power output of the engine but rather the result of a calculation used to determine the excise duty (road tax) payable for the vehicle. The engine in fact produced [...] at 3800 rpm. The car shared a number of features with the famed London Taxi, one of which was the built-in hydraulic <b>jacking</b> <b>system</b> operated from a pump located under the bonnet.|$|E
5000|$|A jackup rig is a barge {{fitted with}} long support legs {{that can be}} raised or lowered. The jackup is maneuvered (self-propelled or by towing) into {{location}} with its legs up and the hull floating on the water. Upon arrival at the work location, the legs are jacked down onto the seafloor. Then [...] "preloading" [...] takes place, where {{the weight of the}} barge and additional ballast water are used to drive the legs securely into the sea bottom so they will not penetrate further while operations are carried out. After preloading, the <b>jacking</b> <b>system</b> is used to raise the entire barge above the water to a predetermined height or [...] "air gap", so that wave, tidal and current loading acts only on the relatively slender legs and not on the barge hull.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} includes 6 kilometres of sidings and a 7,650 {{square metre}} depot building consisting of office facilities {{and the main}} workshop where servicing of the 57 electric trains takes place. The workshop has seven maintenance berths and has overhead gantry cranes and <b>jacking</b> <b>systems</b> for lifting the trains, high-level platforms to access train roofs, under-floor pits and a wheel lathe. There are an automatic train wash and covered platforms to facilitate cleaning of {{the inside of the}} trains.
