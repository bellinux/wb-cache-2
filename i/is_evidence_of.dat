5|$|A {{more careful}} project was {{undertaken}} between 2003 and 2008, with more effort made {{to place the}} stucco fragments. There <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> multiple phases of occupation with different styles of decoration, including flower and leaf patterns, geometric patterns, animal and human figures and epigraphy. Some decorations resemble pre-Islamic Tunisian work, while others are common to other Islamic sites. Evidence of cultural exchange with Egypt is less than might be expected, while the remains show a surprising amount of contact with al-Andalus, despite the continuous hostilities between the Fatimids and the Umayyads of the Iberian peninsula.|$|E
5|$|According to Reuven Firestone, there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{groups of}} Jews venerating Ezra {{to an extent}} greater than {{mainstream}} Judaism, which fits with the interpretation that the verse merely speaks {{of a small group}} of Jews. The book 2 Esdras, a non-canonical book attributed to Babylonian captivity, associates a near-divine or angelic status to Ezra. Mark Lidzbarski and Michael Lodahl have also hypothesized existence of an Arabian Jewish sect whose veneration of Ezra bordered on deification.|$|E

5|$|Although there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{scattered}} Brythonic {{settlements in}} the area, the first major settlement was founded by the Romans after the invasion of 43AD. This lasted only until around 61, when the Iceni tribe led by Queen Boudica stormed it, burning it to the ground. The next, heavily planned, incarnation of Londinium prospered, and it superseded Colchester as {{the capital of the}} Roman province of Britannia in 100. At its height in the 2nd century, Roman London had a population of around 60,000.|$|E
5|$|At higher {{temperatures}} tellurium {{is sufficiently}} plastic to extrude. It melts at 449.51°C. Crystalline tellurium has a structure consisting of parallel infinite spiral chains. The bonding between adjacent atoms {{in a chain}} is covalent, but there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a weak metallic interaction between the neighbouring atoms of different chains. Tellurium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 1.0S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.32 to 0.38eV. Liquid tellurium is a semiconductor, with an electrical conductivity, on melting, of around 1.9 × 103S•cm−1. Superheated liquid tellurium is a metallic conductor.|$|E
5|$|Bronze Age and Roman remains {{have been}} found in the area and there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> an Anglo-Saxon church in the village. The manor of Bentworth was not named in the Domesday Survey of 1086, but {{it was part of the}} Odiham Hundred. During the Second World War, Bentworth Hall was requisitioned as an {{outstation}} for the Royal Navy and nearby Thedden Grange was used as a prisoner of war camp.|$|E

5|$|Brownhills is {{situated}} on the ancient Watling Street and there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial mound and a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle. The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for {{the origin of the}} name is that it refers to the early mining spoil heaps which dotted the area.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and walk down a winding passageway, which <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E
5|$|Cædwalla's {{departure}} in 688 {{appears to}} have led to instability {{in the south of}} England. Ine, Cædwalla's successor, abdicated in 726, and the West Saxon Genealogical Regnal List says that he reigned for thirty-seven years, implying his reign began in 689 instead of 688. This could indicate an unsettled period between Cædwalla's abdication and Ine's accession. The kingship also changed in Kent in 688, with Oswine, who was apparently a Mercian client, taking the throne; and there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> East Saxon influence in Kent in the years immediately following Cædwalla's abdication.|$|E

5|$|Digestive tract telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the digestive tract to a portable digital recorder.|$|E
5|$|For most girls, {{childhood}} {{came to an}} {{end with}} the onset of puberty, which was followed shortly after by betrothal and marriage. Although marriage arranged by the family was the norm, romantic love was not unknown. Most women bore many children but few survived infancy, and grief for the loss of a loved one was an inalienable part of life. The main form of birth control was abstinence, and while there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> contraception it seems to have been mainly used by prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Galloways have a thick {{double-layered}} {{coat that}} is wavy or curly. This thick coat of hair insulates their bodies {{so well that}} they have a minimal outer layer of fat on their bodies, which would otherwise create waste at slaughter. This coat sheds out in the summer months and in warmer climates.

5|$|Homo sapiens sapiens, or modern man, came to Somerset {{during the}} Early Upper Palaeolithic. There <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> {{occupation}} of four Mendip caves 35,000 to 30,000 years ago. During the Last Glacial Maximum, about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, {{it is probable}} that Somerset was deserted as the area experienced tundra conditions. Evidence was found in Gough's Cave of deposits of human bone dating from around 12,500 years ago. The bones were defleshed and probably ritually buried though perhaps related to cannibalism being practised in the area at the time or making skull cups or storage containers. Somerset {{was one of the first}} areas of future England settled following the end of Younger Dryas phase of the last Ice Age c.8000 BC. Cheddar Man is the name given to the remains of a human male found in Gough's Cave in Cheddar Gorge. He is Britain's oldest complete human skeleton. The remains date from about 7150 BC, and it appears that he died a violent death. Somerset is thought to have been occupied by Mesolithic hunter-gatherers from about 6000 BCE; Mesolithic artefacts have been found in more than 70 locations. Mendip caves were used as burial places, with between 50 and 100 skeletons being found in Aveline's Hole. In the Neolithic era, from about 3500 BCE, there <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> farming.|$|E
5|$|Human {{occupation}} {{dates back}} to the Beaker culture of the late Bronze Age. There is also evidence of an Iron Age hill fort and prehistoric barrows and field systems. There <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> a shrine dating from pre-Roman times, which was re-established as a Romano-Celtic Temple in the mid-4th century. According to at least one source, it is extremely likely this was succeeded by a small late-4th-century Christian oratory. Several Roman finds including gold coins of Augustus, Nero, and Drusus, two silver denarii of Vespasian and a Roman carnelian ring were found at the site during quarrying.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{the state}} created the wartime shrine board, which {{expanded}} control over state shrines and expanded the state's role. Up to that point, individual priests had been {{limited in their}} political roles, delegated to certain rituals and shrine upkeep, and rarely encouraged Emperor worship, or other aspects of state ideology, independently. No shrine priest, or member of the Wartime Shrine board, had previously sought public office, which some scholars, such as Sakamoto, suggest <b>is</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> the state's use of Shinto to its own ends, rather than the Shinto priest's attempt to achieve political power.|$|E
