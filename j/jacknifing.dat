40|$|Testate amoebae-based {{transfer}} {{functions are}} commonly used in peatland palaeoclimate studies. These models have been developed in several {{regions of the world}} and are sometimes used for palaeohydrological reconstruction from fossil data in locations where no transfer functions exist. Limitations of this approach may include missing modern analogues and problems associated with site-specific or regional factors in testate amoebae ecology and biogeography. This study presents new testate amoebae-hydrology transfer functions based on data from six peatlands in Northern England. Transfer functions were generated for water table depth and moisture content using weighted averaging tolerance downweighted regression with inverse deshrinking and model performance was assessed using leave-one-out (<b>jacknifing)</b> cross-validation. To examine the robustness of applying transfer functions extra-regionally, we performed a number of spatially independent cross-validation (SICV) tests using contemporary testate amoebae and environmental data from established Northern Ireland and ACCROTELM transfer functions. Inferred water table depths were consistent with observed values in terms of position along the hydrological gradient, however magnitudes varied. We then applied the three independent transfer functions to fossil data from a peatland in Northern England to compare the reconstructions. The results show that the direction of the reconstructions is consistent in terms of wet/dry shifts. However, variation in the magnitudes of the reconstructed water tables is apparent. This probably reflects the sampling regime, including temporal/seasonal effects, and differences in testate amoebae ecology between regions and individual sites...|$|E

5000|$|Jackknife (voiced by Christy Karacas) - A {{low-level}} criminal {{who appears}} in the openings of most episodes committing crimes before getting captured (and beaten up) by Jailbot, where his subsequent journey back to Superjail makes up the opening credits sequence. He is often depicted escaping the jail during the murder sequences in the first season and periodically throughout seasons two and three. He never speaks and communicates only by way of animalistic grunts and shrieks. He is labeled by Jared to be Superjail's most vile inmate due to his upbringing and near lack of any form of morality. <b>Jacknife</b> is depicted as being short-tempered, violent, and misogynistic. During the events of Oedipus Mess, <b>Jacknife</b> is revealed to have sired a son with one of Ultra-Prison's inmates. Having recognized the child as his, <b>Jacknife</b> escaped while the Warden created 1,000 clones of <b>Jacknife</b> that run amok worldwide until all but the original are killed off. In the Season 3 premiere a female version of <b>Jacknife</b> causes chaos at a male strip club, and is later sent to UltraPrison, suggesting that <b>Jacknife</b> either has a sister or a wife.|$|R

40|$|For {{ethical and}} {{logistical}} reasons, population-genetic studies of parasites often {{rely on the}} non-invasive sampling of offspring shed from their definitive hosts. However, if the sampled offspring are naturally derived from {{a small number of}} parents, then the strong family structure can result in biased population-level estimates of genetic parameters, particularly if reproductive output is skewed. Here, we document and correct for the strong family structure present within schistosome offspring (miracidia) that were collected non-invasively from humans in western Kenya. By genotyping 2, 424 miracidia from 12 patients at 12 microsatellite loci and using a sibship clustering program, we found that the samples contained large numbers of siblings. Furthermore, reproductive success of the breeding schistosomes was skewed, creating differential representation of each family in the offspring pool. After removing the family structure with an iterative <b>jacknifing</b> procedure, we demonstrated that the presence of relatives led to inflated estimates of genetic differentiation and linkage disequilibrium, and downwardly-biased estimates of inbreeding coefficients (FIS). For example, correcting for family structure yielded estimates of FST among patients that were 27 times lower than estimates from the uncorrected samples. These biased estimates would cause one to draw false conclusions regarding these parameters in the adult population. We also found from our analyses that {{estimates of the number of}} full sibling families and other genetic parameters of samples of miracidia were highly intercorrelated but are not correlated with estimates of worm burden obtained via egg countin...|$|E

Whether genetic methods or the traditional Kato-Katz estimator provide a better estimate of actual number of adult worms remains to be seen. This study illustrates that family structure must be explicitly accounted for when using offspring samples to estimate the genetic parameters of adult parasite populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of geochemical screening for tracking insects and other organisms is poorly understood. We explored multi-elemental profiles of an insect pest and its food from different locations {{in order to}} identify intrinsic markers of geographic origin. ICP-AES screening was completed for soil, maize grains and Prostephanus truncatus of different geographic origin, with insects collected in the field or reared on maize under controlled conditions. Background level geochemical data are presented with concentrations of Cu, S and Sr in maize, and Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, S, Si, Sr, Ti and Zn in insects differing according to their origin, or that of their food. Cu, Fe and Zn determinations of insects were 20, 6. 5 and 11. 5 times the concentrations of the maize they were reared on. A Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) based on Al, Fe, Sr and Zn successfully assigned 78 % of laboratory-reared P. truncatus and 94 % of field-caught insects to their origin (68 % and 75 % respectively after <b>jacknifing).</b> There was excellent discrimination between insects reared on maize from Guanajuato and Nuevo Léon, and Guanajuato and Michoacán, good separation between Sonora and Nuevo Léon but overlap for Sonora, Guanajuato and Michoacán, and Michoacán and Nuevo Léon. The same LDA for field-caught insects gave complete separation between Michoacán and Sonora, but some overlap between Michoacán and Nuevo Léon. This robust ICP-AES technique successfully identified a combination of elements able to classify insects according to their origin. The model was restricted to elements showing a normal distribution but non-parametric tests suggest other elements may act as intrinsic markers. This shows the potential of atomic spectroscopy for remotely tracing insects and other biological materials, with applications including providing provenance data for species routinely captured for surveillance and to track natural enemies and wildlife. ...|$|E
