5|$|At Caspers Wilderness Park, the San Juan Canyon {{opens up}} into a fairly wide valley {{in the foothills of}} the Santa Ana Mountains. This reach of San Juan Creek is {{underlain}} by thick alluvial deposits and is still used for farming and grazing. It is joined by Bell Canyon <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> from several residential communities that overlook, but do not border, it. and Verdugo Canyon Creek from the left. Trampas Canyon enters from the left and Cañada Gobernadora and Cañada Chiquita enter <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> The creek flows through residential Rancho Mission Viejo, crosses under Interstate 5, and enters a concrete flood control channel, turning south and receiving El Horno Creek on the right. It receives its largest tributary, Trabuco Creek, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> then flows south toward the Pacific Ocean. The creek forms a fresh water lagoon at the northern end of Doheny State Beach, which overflows into Capistrano Bay during periods of high flow.|$|E

5|$|After Cimarron Creek Wash enters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right,</b> Fossil Creek turns sharply south. In {{the next}} stretch, Stehr Lake {{is to the}} right and Deadman Mesa to the left.

5|$|Ithan Creek {{rises in}} a small valley just south of U.S. Route 30 in the {{community}} of Wayne, Pennsylvania. It flows west for several tenths of a mile before receiving its first tributary, Browns Run, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and turning south. The creek passes under Pennsylvania Route 320 and receives two small unnamed tributaries from the left. It flows alongside Interstate 476 and crosses it once. After a short while, it receives Kirks Run <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> near the community of Rosemont, Pennsylvania. It flows alongside the interstate for several tenths of a mile before passing under it again. Shortly thereafter, Ithan Creek enters Haverford Township, Pennsylvania and receives its largest tributary, Meadowbrook Run. It passes under Darby Road and meets its confluence with Darby Creek.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 2016, Diarra scored Nancy's only goal in a 2-1 home defeat against Paris Saint-Germain in a Ligue 1 match by {{heading in}} Benoît Pedretti's free kick <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> in the 55th minute.

5|$|On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts {{became the}} first state in the U.S. to legalize {{same-sex}} marriage after a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in November 2003 determined that the exclusion of same-sex couples <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to a civil marriage was unconstitutional. This decision was eventually superseded by the U.S. Supreme Court's affirmation of same-sex marriage in the United States in 2015.|$|E

Undescended testes, hyperactivity and aggressive behavior have also been noted.|$|E
5|$|Roaring Brook then {{enters the}} Elmhurst Reservoir, where it briefly enters Roaring Brook Township before {{entering}} Elmhurst Township and receiving the tributary White Oak Run <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> The stream continues flowing north-northwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 435 and reentering Roaring Brook Township several tenths {{of a mile}} further downstream. It then crosses Interstate 84 and receives the tributary Rock Bottom Creek <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> as its valley becomes much deeper and narrower. It continues flowing north-northwest {{for more than a}} mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 435 before turning south-southwest and briefly entering Dunmore before reentering Roaring Brook Township. After several tenths of a mile, the stream turns northwest for a few miles, crossing Interstate 84 and reentering Dunmore. It passes through the Scranton Water Company Reservoir and receives the tributary Little Roaring Brook <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> before turning south and then west. It then turns northwest and crosses Interstate 81 before turning southwest and passing through the Nay Aug Gorge. The stream turns northwest for several tenths of a mile before turning west-southwest and crossing US Route 11. After a few tenths of a mile, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
5|$|The creek turns {{south and}} enters the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge 4.5 miles {{upstream}} from its mouth. At this point it passes through the largest freshwater marsh in Pennsylvania before becoming entirely tidal. It turns west-southwest for a few miles, passing by Philadelphia, Folcroft, Norwood, Prospect Park, Tinicum Township, and Ridley Township and receives the tributary Muckinipattis Creek <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right.</b> Darby Creek winds through a large lagoon 30ft deep in places that was dredged in the 1960s. The creek then receives Stony Creek, its last named tributary, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and turns south for a few tenths of a mile before reaching its confluence with the Delaware River.|$|E

5|$|The {{gray whale}} {{has been placed}} {{in a family of}} its own as it is {{sufficiently}} different <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> whales and the rorquals. The gray whale is the only benthic feeding baleen whale, filtering small organisms from the mud of shallow seas. They also have a gestation period of over a year, which is unusual for baleen whales.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground of}} fettering {{discretion}} {{on this basis}} is distinct <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to a fair hearing.

5|$|The only goal of {{the match}} came near the midway point of the first half; Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain {{collected}} a pass from Theo Walcott <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and scored past Thibaut Courtois.

Arsenal's victory was their first against Chelsea in over three years and manager Arsène Wenger's first over José Mourinho in 14 attempts.|$|E

5|$|The video then cuts {{to a shot}} of {{the band}} playing the game before {{returning}} to the map screen as 'Docks' or 'Stage 02' flashes.

A boat/submarine then enters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> and begins firing bombs at the players who destroy it with laser beams. Another cut scene follows in which the crippled boat returns to a hangar in the sea with 'Evil' written above the entrance. The hangar explodes and disappears before flying out of the water, now with mechanical claws attached, and the video returns again to live action footage of the Super Furries playing the game.|$|E
5|$|We incline to {{the view}} that on his abdication the Duke of Windsor could not have claimed the right to be {{described}} as a Royal Highness.
