40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an evaluation of}} the experiments for knowledge exchange using social media during TSRC’s Beyond the Radar knowledge exchange work. Launched in July 2011, the “#btr 11 ” experiment sought to trial, and learn from, new ways of engaging with people around ‘below the radar’ issues using a range of online platforms. The paper introduces the project and the evaluation approach, before describing the project in greater detail. The approach is then contextualised within digital knowledge exchange literatures, and justification is provided for using social exchange theory as the evaluation’s underlying framework. Next, the paper uses this framework to generate some learning from #btr 11, through a thematic discussion around accepted practices, shared values and exchange relationships. It concludes with a summary and a set of lessons and insights that could be helpful for future experimentation with social media platforms. Hyperlinks have been provided where possible to provide readers with direct links to all the resources used for the evaluation – other resources are given in the bibliography.

40|$|This {{document}} is {{the output of}} work which aims to provide a practical guide to help use the trafilm gallery as well as add new information, samples, and metadata, and even audiovisual files / clips. The purpose {{is to build a}} database of metadata for as many instances of multilingualism as possible as they appear in audiovisuals, basically, fictional feature films and TV series. The concept of multilingualism for trafilm is broad enough to include sign language and dialects and language which is different from the main language of the AV text because the speaker is somehow impeded or conditioned (e. g. non-native speaker, or intoxicated or somehow conditioned) as well as more commonly accepted forms of language variation such as foreign languages, ancient languages and made-up, or constructed, languages. Translation options include dubbing, subtitling (standard or SDH) and audio description. This document includes: • Concepts and definitions, a <b>glossary</b> and <b>abbreviations</b> • A detailed, faithful representation of the online gallery and forms • Explanations and specifications to help newcomers become familiar with how the system works • Some screenshots and illustrations to help visualise what is being referred to • Instructions on how to fill in the forms The order of the forms is important as it reflects the dependency relationship that exists between them, whereby the metadata provided for the higher-level form is automatically shared by all lower-level forms.

The data on the individual compounds are presented in a form similar to that used by Prof. Isadore Berlman in his classic handbook of fluorescence spectra. The temporal properties and relative efficiencies of the new scintillators are presented in Table 1, and the efficiencies as a function of wavelength are presented graphically in Figure 1. In addition, there is a descriptive <b>glossary</b> of the <b>abbreviations</b> used herein. Figure 2 illustrates the basic structures of some of the compounds and of the four solvents reported in this summary. The emission spectra generally exhibit more structure than the absorption spectra, with the result that the peak emission wavelength for a given compound may lie several nm away from the wavelength, {lambda}{sub avg}, at the geometric center of the emission spectrum. Therefore, the author has chosen to list absorption peaks, {lambda}{sub max}, and emission {lambda}{sub avg} values in Figures 3 [...] 30, as being most illustrative {{of the differences between the}} compounds. The compounds, BHTP, BTPB, ADBT, and DPTPB were all developed on this program. P-terphenyl, PBD, and TPB are commercially available blue emitters.

40|$|This guide {{provides}} {{an introduction to}} the application of tuberculosis (TB) genotyping to TB control practices and to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) TB Genotyping Program. It was written by the National Tuberculosis Controllers Association (NTCA) /CDC Advisory Group on Tuberculosis Genotyping and is intended for TB controllers, epidemiologists, laboratorians, and other program staff members who will be involved in submitting isolates for genotyping, analyzing and responding to genotyping results, or using genotyping data to monitor TB transmission trends. This guide does not contain specific directions on how a TB control program must carry out its genotyping program. The CDC genotyping program is not a research effort, and participating state and local programs are not required to carry out a protocol, submit a certain number of isolates, or collect specific data. Rather, this guide provides general guidance about how to utilize the genotyping laboratories, how to understand genotyping results, and how to apply those results to improve TB control practices. For those interested in the specific procedures used by other TB genotyping programs, the Maryland TB program and the New York City TB program have agreed to share their procedure manuals; those documents can be downloaded from our TB genotyping WebBoard at [URL] - p. 11.

The guide presents 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 points to consider 22 ̆ 0 ac? and 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 recommendations 22 ̆ 0 ac? which should be given careful attention by CDC staff responsible for developing guidelines. To prepare the guide, a working group of CDC staff synthesized the best advice on guideline development methods available in published journal articles and reports. This summary describes the agency 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s history with guideline development, each of 13 primary tasks associated with the guideline development process, and important 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 points to consider 22 ̆ 0 ac? when developing practice guidelines. Table 1 associates each task in the CDC guideline development process with the participants and task-specific products. CDC develops {{a broad range of}} guidelines which offer advice to clinicians, public health practitioners, managed care organizations, and the public on how to improve the effectiveness and impact of public health interventions. Guidelines developed by CDC over the years generally have been highly regarded within and outside the health care and public health communities, and may frequently be considered the standard of preventive health care. CDC guidelines are currently developed by chartered advisory committees, ad hoc groups, and CDC staff. The processes used vary widely across topics which generally reflect the agency 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s programmatic responsibilities. The rationale for recommendations ranges from expert opinion to 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 best available evidence 22 ̆ 0 ac? as determined by explicit rules of evidence. The authors recognize that a single approach to guideline development at CDC cannot accommodate all situations because of the tremendous range of topics, varying levels of scientific data, and urgency for development of some guidelines. However, CDC must do better for the following reasons. First, the process for developing the guidelines and the rationale for the recommendations are not always made clear to the user. Second, the format and content of CDC guidelines have never been standardized. Third, plans for disseminating the guidelines are sometimes not formulated in advance. Fourth, the extent to which CDC guidelines are followed varies greatly. Fifth, there is no standardized approach to assessing the impact of CDC guidelines; although many CDC programs have used surveillance systems, surveys, or other indicators to measure impact.

40|$|These guidelines, Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies in Schools and Early Care and Education Programs (hereafter {{called the}} Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies), were {{developed}} in response to Section 112 of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was enacted in 2011. This act is designed to improve food safety in the United States by shifting the focus from response to prevention. Section 112 (b) calls for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, {{in consultation with the}} Secretary of Education, to "develop guidelines to be used on a voluntary basis to develop plans for individuals to manage the risk of food allergy and anaphylaxis in schools and early childhood education programs" and "make such guidelines available to local educational agencies, schools, early childhood education programs, and other interested entities and individuals to be implemented on a voluntary basis only. " Each plan, described in the act to manage the risk of food allergy and anaphylaxis in schools and early childhood education programs, that is developed for an individual shall be considered an education record for the purpose of Section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act (commonly referred to as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act). The act specifies that nothing in the guidelines developed under its auspices should be construed to preempt state law. These guidelines were prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&# 039;s (CDC&# 039;s) National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, Division of Population Health, with conceptual, technical, and editorial help from other federal agencies, including the U. S. Department of Education, U. S. Department of Agriculture, and U. S. Department of Justice; other operating divisions of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), including the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH). CDC acknowledges Mr. Pete Hunt (HHS/CDC) for his role as lead author of these guidelines. CDC also acknowledges Dr. Katherine Beckmann (HHS/ACF), Dr. Stefano Luccioli (HHS/FDA), Dr. Scott Sicherer (Mount Sinai School of Medicine), Ms. Marlie Doucet (Research Fellow, Oak Ridge Institute for Science), and Dr. Lani Wheeler (contractor, DANYA, Inc.) for their significant contribution. These guidelines are based on expert panel guidance received in 2010.
