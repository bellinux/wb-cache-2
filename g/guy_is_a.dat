500|$|The term [...] "hoochie coochie", with {{variations}} in the spelling, is used in different contexts. [...] Appearing in the late 19th century, the hoochie coochie was a sexually provocative dance.

[...] By one account, it first appeared at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition in 1876 and was a popular attraction at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. [...] The dance is associated with entertainers Little Egypt and Sophie Tucker, but by the 1910s it declined in popularity. [...] "Hoochie coochie" [...] {{is also used to}} refer to a sexually attractive person or a practitioner of hoodoo. [...] In his autobiography, I Am the Blues, Dixon included [...] "hoochie coochie man" [...] in his examples of a seer or a clairvoyant with a connection to folklore of the American South: [...] "This <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> hoodoo man, this lady is a witch, this other guy's a hoochie coochie man, she's some kind of voodoo person".|$|E

As frustration built, Urlacher criticized the Bears offense, stating that the addition of quarterback Jay Cutler had changed the team's identity. The Bears, who have historically employed a strong running game, were beginning to rely more on the pass on offense. He went on to say, [...] "Kyle Orton might not be the flashiest quarterback, but the <b>guy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> winner, and that formula worked for us. I hate to say it, but that's the truth." [...] Urlacher and Cutler later made amends. The Bears finished the season with a 7–9 record, and missed the playoffs for the third consecutive year.|$|E

Like Lee, and choosing not to use other ninjutsu skills out of respect for his student, <b>Guy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> specialist in physical attacks and taught Lee many of the techniques that he learned from his father Might Dai, such as the ability to unlock the Eight Gates which safely restrict the flow of chakra through the body.
