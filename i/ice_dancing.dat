5|$|Great Britain had {{qualified}} seven athletes; one in ladies singles, {{one pair}} in the pairs skating, and two pairs in <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> The team was announced as Jenna McCorkell {{in the ladies}} singles, Stacey Kemp and David King in the pairs and in the <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> Sinead Kerr and John Kerr, and Penny Coomes and Nicholas Buckland. Brother and sister pairing Sinead and John Kerr were considered medal contenders before the Games {{as they entered the}} event ranked fifth in the world. The pair, who came third in the 2009 European Championships, went on to finish eighth.|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} {{consecutive}} Winter Olympics, Great Britain's sole medal was a gold at a figure skating event, this time in <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> by Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who received the first-ever set of perfect scores in their free program routine.|$|E
5|$|In London, {{figure skating}} was {{presented}} in four events: men's singles, women's singles, men's special figures, and mixed pairs. The special figures contest was won by Russian Nikolai Panin, who gave his country its first ever Olympic gold medal. He remains the event's sole winner, as it was subsequently dropped from the program. Once a demonstration event at Grenoble 1968, <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> has been an official medal-awarding Olympic figure skating event since it was introduced in 1976.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 Winter Olympics, officially {{known as}} the XII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Innsbruck, Austria, from 4 to 15 February 1976. A total of 1,123 athletes {{representing}} 37 National Olympic Committees (NOC) participated in 37 events from 10 different sports and disciplines. Two events were contested for the first time: the figure skating discipline of <b>ice</b> <b>dancing,</b> and the men's 1,000 metres in speed skating.|$|E
5|$|In figure skating, {{relaxation}} of the amateurism rules led to several former stars returning. The ladies' singles {{has resulted in}} the as-yet highest United States Winter Olympic television viewership, thanks to Tonya Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly hiring Shane Stant to club fellow female figure skater Nancy Kerrigan in the knee. The ladies' singles was won by Ukraine's Oksana Baiul, while the men's singles was won by Russia's Alexei Urmanov, the <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> was won by Russians Oksana Grishuk and Evgeny Platov and the pair skating was won by Russians Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov.|$|E
5|$|Australia first {{competed in}} figure skating in 1952, and has competed in 1956, 1960 and every Olympics since 1980. In earlier years, Australia earned some last places or near-misses. Until 1988, no Australian had placed above the 20th percentile, but results have slowly improved; Anthony Liu {{finished}} 10th out of 28 {{competitors in the}} men's event in 2002. Joanne Carter represented Australia in 1998 & 2006. She had placed 12th in 2002 and apart from Liu is the only Australian to have placed in {{the top half of}} the field. In 2010, Australia's lone participant Cheltzie Lee came 20th. Australia has competed in <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> only twice—in 1988 and 2014—when their solitary representative in both the men and women's individual event came last.|$|E
5|$|German Georg Hackl won {{a silver}} in the singles luge, {{becoming}} the first athlete in Olympic history to win medals in the same individual event in five consecutive Olympics. Canada achieved an unprecedented double by winning both the men's and women's ice hockey gold medals. Canada became embroiled with Russia in a controversy that involved the judging of the pairs figure skating competition. The Russian pair of Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze competed against the Canadian pair of Jamie Salé and David Pelletier for the gold medal. The Canadians appeared to have skated well enough to win the competition, yet the Russians were awarded the gold. The judging broke along Cold War lines with judges from former Communist countries favouring the Russian pair and judges from Western nations voting for the Canadians. The only exception was the French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, who awarded the gold to the Russians. An investigation revealed {{that she had been}} pressured to give the gold to the Russian pair regardless of how they skated; in return the Russian judge would look favourably on the French entrants in the <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> competition. The IOC decided to award both pairs the gold medal in a second medal ceremony held later in the Games. Australian Steven Bradbury became the first gold medallist from the southern hemisphere when he won the 1,000metre short-track speed skating event.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the large}} number of competitors, the men's, ladies', and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> {{competitions}} required a preliminary round prior to the main competition. The top 12 men and ladies advanced to the short program and the top 10 <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> teams advanced to the short dance.|$|E
25|$|Lifts are a {{required}} element in pair skating and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The four {{disciplines}} of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> also appeared {{as part of}} a team event {{for the first time at}} the 2014 Winter Olympics.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 World Figure Skating Championships was {{a senior}} {{international}} figure skating competition in the 2010–11 season. Medals were awarded in the disciplines of men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating, and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1952, <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> {{was added}} to the World Championships. It {{appeared}} at the 1968 Winter Olympics as a demonstration sport and was added as a medal sport at the 1976 Olympics.|$|E
25|$|Four skating {{has mostly}} {{disappeared}} while synchronized skating and solo <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> have grown. On April 6, 2011, the International Olympic Committee officially confirmed {{the approval of}} a team event, to be introduced at the 2014 Winter Olympics. The elimination of the compulsory dance provided space for the team event. Each team will be composed of a men's and ladies single skater, a pair, and an <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> team. Ten teams may compete, with five eliminated after the short program. In December 2011, the International Skating Union released details of the qualifying system and the competition.|$|E
25|$|With this change, <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> was {{shortened}} to two segments per competition: {{the short}} dance {{and the free}} dance. This mirrored the short program and free skating segments of single skating and pair skating.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the current}} season's World Championships, {{the results from}} the {{earliest}} season are deleted. A new partnership starts with zero points — there is no transfer of WS points if a pair or <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> couple split up and form a new partnership.|$|E
25|$|The 2012 European Figure Skating Championships was an {{international}} figure skating {{competition in the}} 2011–12 season. The event determined the European Champions in men's singles, ladies singles, pair skating, and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> The competition was held from 23 to 29 January 2012 in Sheffield, England.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>dancing</b> {{is again}} for couples {{consisting}} of {{a woman and a}} man skating together. Ice dance differs from pairs in focusing on intricate footwork performed in close dance holds, in time with the music. Ice dance lifts must not go above the shoulder.|$|E
25|$|The short dance (SD) is {{the first}} segment in an <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> competition. Approved by the June 2010 {{congress}} of the International Skating Union, it {{was introduced in the}} 2010–11 figure skating season. It merges the original dance (OD) and compulsory dance (CD), which were both discontinued.|$|E
25|$|Khokhlova {{began her}} skating career with Aleko, a children's ice ballet based in Moscow. At {{the age of}} 13, she {{considered}} taking up pair skating but {{was too old to}} learn the jumps so a coach suggested she try <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> Khokhlova initially competed with Andrei Maximishin.|$|E
25|$|In pair skating, spins may be {{performed}} side-by-side with both partners {{doing the same}} spin or combination spin at the same time. Additionally, in pairs and in <b>ice</b> <b>dancing,</b> there are pair and dance spins, during which both skaters rotate around the same axis while holding onto each other.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ice</b> <b>dancing</b> {{competitions}} formerly {{consisted of}} three phases: one or more compulsory dances; an original dance to a ballroom rhythm that is designated annually; and a free dance to music of the skaters' own choice. Beginning in the 2010–11 season, the compulsory and original dances were merged into the short dance.|$|E
25|$|Evan Bates began skating at age four. He {{trained as}} a single skater and tested up to the Junior level in the USFSA testing structure, landing jumps through the double axel. He began {{training}} with <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> coaches Yuri Chesnichenko and Yaroslava Nechaeva after they moved to the United States.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, the Soviet Union rose {{to become a}} {{dominant}} power in the sport, especially in the disciplines of pair skating and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> At every Winter Olympics from 1964 until 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair won gold in pair skating, often {{considered one of the}} longest winning streaks in modern sports history. The 1967 World Championships was the last event held in an outdoor rink.|$|E
25|$|Prize {{money is}} {{relatively}} {{low compared to}} other sports. A men's or ladies' singles skater who won the 2011 World Championships earned $45,000 (USD), about 1.8% to 2.5% of the $1,800,000-$2,400,000 USD for winners of the tennis US Open and Australian Open. A couple who won the pairs or <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> title split $67,500. A winner of the senior Grand Prix Final in December 2011 earned $25,000 USD.|$|E
25|$|Remaining as novices in the 2003–04 season, Samuelson/Bates {{won their}} {{regional}} championship {{to qualify for}} their sectional championship, where they won the silver medal. This qualified them for the 2004 U.S. Championships on the novice level. At nationals, they won the bronze medal. Their placement at nationals earned them {{a trip to the}} Estonia International <b>Ice</b> <b>Dancing</b> Championships on the novice level, where they won the silver medal.|$|E
25|$|Figure skaters {{were once}} subject to {{restrictive}} amateur status rules. In May 1990, the International Skating Union voted to allow skaters who were intending to skate professionally {{to return to}} ISU competition if they obtained their national association's permission. In June 1992, skaters who had already lost their eligibility were {{given an opportunity to}} apply for reinstatement in order to compete at the 1994 Winter Olympics. The Champions Series was introduced in 1995 and retitled the Grand Prix series in 1998. The Four Continents Figure Skating Championships were held {{for the first time in}} 1999 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada and the World Team Trophy in 2009 in Tokyo, Japan. After the 2009–10 season, the <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> competition was reduced from three segments to two by combining the compulsory and original dances into the short dance. The team event made its Olympic debut at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Beginning in the 2014–15 season, all disciplines are allowed to use music with lyrics or words, previously restricted to <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b>|$|E
25|$|In December 2004, {{following}} his retirement from professional football, {{he became one}} of the celebrities to take part in Strictly <b>Ice</b> <b>Dancing,</b> an ice dance version of Strictly Come Dancing, in which celebrities are paired with professional dancers. He joined the show at late notice, replacing Paul Gascoigne. With just eight days to prepare for the show, broadcast on BBC One on 26 December, Seaman and his professional partner Zoia Birmingham managed to win the competition. The other competitors spent a month in training for the show.|$|E
25|$|Skaters are {{generally}} free to select their own attire, {{with a few}} restrictions. In competition, females may wear a dress, typically with matching attached briefs, and since 2004, they may also choose trousers. They may wear opaque flesh-colored leggings or tights under dresses and skirts, which may extend to cover their skates. Men must wear trousers – {{they are not allowed}} to wear tights, although, officials do not always impose a deduction for violations. Matching costumes are not required in pair skating and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b>|$|E
25|$|Competitive skaters {{generally}} do not wear helmets or other protective gear. There is a risk of head injuries, particularly in pair skating {{as a result of}} falls from lifts. Although pair skaters are most susceptible, serious head injuries can occur in all disciplines, including <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> Partners have accidentally slashed each other with their skate blades. This may occur when partners drift too close during side-by-side camel spins. Several female pair skaters have suffered head/face injuries during this element, including Elena Berezhnaya, Jessica Dubé, Mandy Wötzel, Galina Maniachenko (Efremenko), and Elena Riabchuk.|$|E
25|$|Figure skating is a Sport {{in which}} individuals, duos, or groups perform on figure skates on ice. It {{was the first}} winter sport {{included}} in the Olympics, in 1908. The four Olympic disciplines are men's singles, ladies' singles, pair skating and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> Non-Olympic disciplines include synchronized skating and four skating. From novice through senior-level competition, skaters generally perform two programs (short and long) which, depending on the discipline, may include spins, jumps, elements they have learned from moves in the field, lifts, throw jumps, death spirals and other elements or moves.|$|E
25|$|Weir has an {{interest}} in fashion design and, in addition to designing some of his own skating costumes, has designed <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> costumes for Melissa Gregory and Denis Petukhov, and show costumes for Oksana Baiul. In 2010 Weir opened a Be Unique fashion label with a line of $95 black jackets. He also designed Yuzuru Hanyu's costume for his free program of 2010-2011 season, including one he wore while winning the gold medal at the 2014 Winter Olympics. In 2011 Weir designed a line of women's dresses for eDressMe.com and appeared in a photo shoot to advertise the offering.|$|E
25|$|For {{competitive}} programs, figure skaters {{were once}} restricted to instrumental music, including vocal music if it contained no lyrics or words. Beginning in the 1997–98 season, the International Skating Union decided to allow lyrics or words in <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> Although {{the rules were}} not relaxed for singles and pairs, judges did not always penalize violations. At the 2011 World Championships, Florent Amodio's long program music included words but an insufficient number of judges voted for a deduction. In June 2012, the International Skating Union voted to allow skaters from all disciplines to choose music with words in their competitive programs beginning in the 2014–15 season.|$|E
25|$|In the men's free skating, Brian Joubert slashed {{his hand}} on his skate blade and left drops of blood all over the ice; he {{completed}} the program but later required medical attention. Also during the free skating, a screw in Daisuke Takahashi's skate came loose on his first jump. He was able to get it repaired and resumed his program within the three minutes allowed. Oda ruined his chances of a medal by doing an extra triple jump, resulting in a loss of 13 points. Florent Amodio used music with lyrics, which is not allowed in competitive skating with the exception of <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> He was not given the normally required one-point penalty because not enough judges voted for it.|$|E
25|$|Larisa Latynina, who {{currently}} holds {{the record for}} the most gold Olympic medals won by a woman, established the USSR as the dominant force in gymnastics for many years. Today, Russia is the leading nation in rhythmic gymnastics with Yevgeniya Kanayeva. Double 50m and 100m freestyle Olympic gold medalist Alexander Popov is widely considered the greatest sprint swimmer in history. Russian synchronized swimming {{is the best in the}} world, with almost all gold medals at Olympics and World Championships having been swept by Russians in recent decades. Figure skating is another popular sport in Russia, especially pair skating and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing.</b> With the exception of 2010 a Soviet or Russian pair has won gold at every Winter Olympics since 1964.|$|E
25|$|Russian {{synchronized}} swimming {{is the best}} in the world, with almost all gold medals having been swept by Russians at Olympics and World Championships for more than a decade. Figure skating is another popular sport in Russia; in the 1960s, the Soviet Union rose to become a dominant power in figure skating, especially in pair skating and <b>ice</b> <b>dancing,</b> and at every Winter Olympics from 1964 until 2006, a Soviet or Russian pair has won gold, often considered the longest winning streak in modern sports history. Since the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced a number of famous tennis players. Chess is also a widely popular pastime; from 1927, Soviet and Russian chess grandmasters have held the world championship almost continuously.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, {{more than}} 24 {{million people in}} Great Britain watched <b>ice</b> <b>dancing</b> pair Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean earn {{unanimous}} 6.0s for presentation, the only perfect score in Olympic skating history, which was ranked the 8th greatest sporting moment in a UK poll. In the 1993 National Sports Study II, considered by the Associated Press as the largest study of spectator sport popularity in America, ladies' figure skating was the second most popular spectator sport in America, just behind NFL football out of over 100 sports surveyed. The 1993 study found that three figure skaters — Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming, and Scott Hamilton — were among the eight most popular athletes in the United States, out of over 800 athletes surveyed. Dorothy Hamill was statistically tied with Mary Lou Retton as the most popular athlete in America. The Tonya Harding scandal in 1994 increased interest in figure skating. The {{first night of the}} ladies' figure skating competition in the 1994 Winter Olympics achieved higher TV Nielsen ratings than that year's Super Bowl and was the most watched sports television program of all-time, to that date.|$|E
