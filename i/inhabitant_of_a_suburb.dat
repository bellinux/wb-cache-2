The method {{is based on}} the study of the association of dense words, words that convey most of the emotional components of texts.

A case example shows the use of ETA, with the assistance of specific software, in analyzing the interviews <b>of</b> the <b>inhabitants</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> city <b>suburb</b> with respect to their expectations of fulfillment and development in relation to perceived local opportunities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} methodological {{and empirical}} studies of genetic risk prediction of common diseases. The methodological studies involved {{the evaluation of}} traditional and new methods of model performance, the evaluation of rare variants for risk prediction of common diseases, the assessment of simulations strategies for replication of empirical data, and the evaluation of reporting in empirical risk prediction studies. The empirical studies involved the evaluation of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic tests, the external validation of genetic risk prediction models across European samples, and the evaluation of differences in prediction performance in published genetic risk prediction models. Both simulated and empirical data were used to conduct these studies. By means <b>of</b> simulation, <b>a</b> population distribution <b>of</b> genetic variants was created starting from the effect size and frequency of individual variants and assuming that genetic variants are inherited independently and that their joint effects follow a multiplicative risk model. The empirical data came from the Rotterdam study, a prospective, population-based, cohort study among 7, 983 <b>inhabitants</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Rotterdam <b>suburb,</b> designed to investigate determinants of chronic diseases; and from a community-based cohort i. e., the combination of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Cardiovascular Health Study and Framingham Heart Study...|$|R
5000|$|Mr Ponsonby is {{the fourth}} novel from noted New Zealand author Ian Middleton, and is {{described}} as [...] "his eulogy to a gentrifying Ponsonby". He had an intimate connection with Ponsonby (<b>a</b> <b>suburb</b> in Auckland, New Zealand), where the book is set, beginning in 1942 and returning to live there in later life. It is the story <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man driven by greed, willing to destroy the character and nature <b>of</b> <b>a</b> lively, spririted community for the sake <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dollar. Mr Ponsonby [...] "vividly recreates the atmosphere and characters <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Auckland <b>suburb</b> threatened by reconstruction" [...] and the clash between the proponents of progress, development and gentrification and the <b>inhabitants</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> established community with its own unique character.|$|R
