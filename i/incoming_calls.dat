5|$|On April 4, 1968, African-American {{civil rights}} leader Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated by a sniper in Memphis, Tennessee. United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy was {{traveling}} to Indianapolis to promote his presidential campaign {{when he heard the}} news. He delivered a brief, improvised speech on the matter before suspending all of his campaign activities and withdrawing to his room at the Marott Hotel. After several phone conversations with black community leaders, he decided to speak out against the violent backlash to the assassination and carry on with a scheduled appearance before the City Club of Cleveland. His aides concurred that this was the best course of action, and agreed that he should shortly thereafter go to Washington D.C. and remain there until King could be buried. Kennedy also spoke over the phone with Coretta Scott King, King's widow, in Atlanta. At her request, Kennedy directed aide Frank Mankiewicz to arrange for a plane to retrieve King's body. Since most air carriers were wary of taking up such a task, a plane was chartered from one of Kennedy's friends. John Lewis and Earl Graves, among others, were dispatched to assist Coretta Scott King. Kennedy also had three additional phone lines installed at the King residence to handle the influx of <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> while his staff established a phone bank at West Hunter Baptist Church in Atlanta for the King family's use.|$|E

25|$|Hayes was a {{computer}} hobbyist, {{and felt that}} modems would be highly compelling to users of the new 8-bit computers that would soon be known as home computers. However, existing modems were simply too expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users.

25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, {{and could not be}} used with other useful platforms like video terminals. External modems were available for these platforms but required the phone to be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.|$|E
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure 2, the JRRM module {{contains}} the JCAC algorithm. An MT {{wanting to make}} a call (initiate a session) sends a service request to the JRRM module.

T[*]=[*] 0 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> cannot be admitted into the heterogeneous network. Therefore, the call is blocked or dropped. T[*]=[*] 1 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> can be admitted into just one of the available RATs. Hence, there is no layer splitting. T[*]>[*] 1 implies that the <b>incoming</b> <b>call</b> is scalable and it will be admitted into more than one RAT.|$|R

25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection, and another dedicated to answering <b>incoming</b> <b>calls</b> that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard.

[...] All calls are prioritized by medical symptom/condition acuity. [...] This process may be further complicated by panic-stricken callers who scream, cry, or make unreasonable demands. [...] The trained EMD uses interpersonal and crisis management skills to sort through these distractions, taking control of the conversation, calming the caller, and extracting the necessary information. [...] This inquiry begins with the obvious questions regarding whether the patient is conscious or breathing. [...] The questioning will continue until the EMD is able to qualify a potentially life-threatening condition, at which time the closest appropriate response resource (such as a paramedic-staffed ambulance service) is notified to initiate pinpointing the call location. [...] When this occurs, the EMD will continue the questioning, attempting to gather additional relevant information, useful to determine response speed, the type of resources dispathed, or the type of equipment that the paramedics will bring to the site when they arrive. [...] In most cases, this 'pre-alert' function will not be required, and the resource will simply be dispatched when all of the required information has been gathered. [...] Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed, or when to interrupt the established process, requires the judgment of the EMD handling the call. [...] Otherwise, the manner in which this questioning proceeds is often governed by protocols, or by decision-support software.|$|E
