5|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{important}} that people see that spirituality is {{at the base of}} Nonviolent Communication, and that they learn the mechanics of the process with that in mind. It's really a spiritual practice that I am trying to show as a way of life. Even though we don't mention this, people get seduced by the practice. Even if they practice this as a mechanical technique, they start to experience things between themselves and other people they weren't able to experience before. So eventually they come to the spirituality of the process. They begin to see that it's more than a communication process and realize it's really an attempt to manifest a certain spirituality.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a lovely thought and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> up to {{the states}} to work out their social {{problems}} if possible, and while I have always been interested in seeing that the Negro has a square deal, I have never dissipated my strength against the particular stone wall of segregation. I believe that wall will crumble when the Negro has brought himself to a high educational and economic status…. Moreover, while there are no segregation laws in the North, there is segregation in fact and we might as well recognize this.|$|E

Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> natural perversity; {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> false pride {{at getting}} over sea-sickness; sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> reading 'Robinson Crusoe,' and books warning of {{me not to}} go to sea." ...|$|R

5000|$|Five years later, {{singer and}} co-writer Ron Peno said the album {{remained}} the band's creative watermark. [...] "Now there's an album {{that should have}} done something," [...] he told the Daily Telegraph. [...] "It's a very loved album and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a special record for us. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> criminal that <b>it</b> got ignored." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of the region is necessarily slow, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also certain. There is every reason for expecting a steady and progressive increase in earnings for an indefinite period in the future. I am not in entire accord with the general manager's statement that the business secured from this branch may be replaced from points on our own lines. Contrary to the belief, the supplies of cedar in western Washington are comparatively limited, and the greatest reserves of this timber are {{along the line of}} the Lake Shore. I think it but {{a matter of a few}} years when the cedar will be exhausted on our other lines.|$|E
25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E
25|$|The IRA gave clear {{reasons for}} the execution. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unfortunate that anyone has to be killed, but the furor created by Mountbatten's death showed up the hypocritical {{attitude}} of the media establishment. As {{a member of the}} House of Lords, Mountbatten was an emotional figure in both British and Irish politics. What the IRA did to him is what Mountbatten had been doing all his life to other people; and with his war record I don't think he could have objected to dying in what was clearly a war situation. He knew the danger involved in coming to this country. In my opinion, the IRA achieved its objective: people started paying attention to what was happening in Ireland.|$|E

25|$|In the {{trenches}} of World War One, Johnson's name {{was used by}} British troops to describe the impact of German 150mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E
500|$|Ten years ago, any fish {{getting as}} far down as Salford {{would have been}} killed almost {{immediately}} by the pollution in the water. [...] Although the river {{there is now a}} great deal better than it has been for 100 years, fish will probably not be able to live long. [...] These had probably got into the main river from small streams flowing into the Irwell. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> real progress.|$|E
500|$|When {{posed the}} film's central question, can {{men and women}} just be friends, Ryan replied, [...] "Yes, men and women can just be friends. I {{have a lot of}} platonic (male) friends, and sex doesn't get in the way." [...] Crystal said, [...] "I'm a little more optimistic than Harry. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> difficult. Men {{basically}} act like stray dogs in front of a supermarket. I do have platonic (women) friends, but not best, best, best friends." ...|$|E

500|$|On 22 February 2008, it was {{reported}} that the airline has been considering the new Airbus A350 made by EADS unit Airbus, the Boeing787's direct competitor in the medium-size aircraft market. Japan Airlines spokesman Stephen Pearlman said: [...] "We have taken a look at the A350. As far as adding this aircraft to our fleet in future goes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> one of the strong candidates." [...] JAL ordered A350 aircraft on 7 October 2013 (18 -900 and 13 -1000 firm orders, plus 25 options).|$|E
500|$|Blair answered, [...] "I {{agree with}} my honourable friend. I think it's {{important}} {{that any of}} the companies engaged in promoting these types of goods have some sense of responsibility and also some sensitivity to the feelings of others. I think this is an immensely difficult area, the relationship between what happens with these games and its impact on young people. I've no doubt this debate will go on for a significant period of time, but I do agree. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> important that people understand there is a wider social responsibility as well as an interior responsibility for profits." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2006, {{the band}} {{incorporated}} its publishing {{business in the}} Netherlands following the capping of Irish artists' tax exemption at €250,000. The Edge stated that businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens. The move was criticised in the Irish parliament. The band defended themselves, saying approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, that they were taxed globally because of this, {{and that they were}} all [...] "personal investors and employers in the country". Bono later said, [...] "I think U2's tax business is our own business and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> not just to {{the letter of the law}} but to the spirit of the law." ...|$|E

No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Barrales, {{beyond the}} name, Bonded by Blood {{borrowed}} from Exodus for inspiration everything. [...] "From the guitars being razor-sharp to the drums, the speed. We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> great." ...|$|E
500|$|Initially, Mark Ruffalo was not {{interested}} in the project but Fincher wanted him to play David Toschi. He met with the actor and told him that he was rewriting the screenplay. [...] "I loved what he was saying and loved where he was going with it", the actor remembers. For research, he read every report on the case and read all the books on the subject. Ruffalo met Toschi and found out that he had [...] "perfect recall of the details and what happened when, where, who was there, what he was wearing. He always knew what he was wearing. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> seared into who he is and {{it was a big deal}} for him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ninety-nine {{percent of}} <b>it</b> (Migrant) <b>was</b> written on piano, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> felt {{right to keep}} that a focal point. But also, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a {{conscious}} decision to make it a slightly more stripped-down record, as far as the scope and the grandeur goes. The idea was to keep the tone in general a little bit smaller with not so many doubles and big rock guitar and heavy spots on the record...with the lyrics of this new record being transparently about myself, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important to not dehumanize the performances by over-layering them or over-doubling them. As you double vocals, they lose their intimate inflection, and whatever transparent emotion that's trying to be conveyed in them is washed out, which can be a good thing. For this record, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> important not to do that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{very kind}} of her {{thinking}} of it," [...] Isobel said, [...] "and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> nice of you, Doctor, to say that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an evident relief {{to her when she}} found I had someone else to take care of me.

500|$|Reception to Hair {{upon its}} Broadway premiere was, with exceptions, {{overwhelmingly}} positive. [...] Clive Barnes {{wrote in the}} New York Times: [...] "What is so likable about Hair...? [...] <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> simply {{that it is so}} likable. [...] So new, so fresh, and so unassuming, even in its pretensions." [...] John J. O'Connor of The Wall Street Journal said the show was [...] "exuberantly defiant and the production explodes into every nook and cranny of the Biltmore Theater". Richard Watts Jr. of the New York Post wrote that [...] "it has a surprising if perhaps unintentional charm, its high spirits are contagious, and its young zestfulness makes it difficult to resist." ...|$|E
500|$|Chaiken also didn't want {{to portray}} Jenny's ordeal in an {{explicit}} manner, confirming this she said: [...] "I am loath to portray rape as a filmmaker. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{really hard to}} do it without somehow becoming complicit and exploitative. And so as much as it's important to talk about it, I wanted to be vague and not milk it." [...] Chaiken has also admitted that the use of dream sequences involving Jenny were not a successful inclusion, but claimed it was necessary to portray Jenny coming to terms with her abuse. Heather Hogan of AfterEllen criticized the storyline because there was no conclusion to it, also stating it was never explored enough, leading everyone to think she was just a jerk.|$|E
