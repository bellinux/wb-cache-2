25|$|Weinstein is the {{daughter}} of Irving Weinstein, a funeral director and owner of Weinstein & Schlump Funeral Homes. She grew up in the Grand Concourse in the borough of the Bronx in New York City. She is the former lover of Ethel Merman (although she tends to exaggerate the details of their now infamous 1967 tryst during Ethel's daughter's funeral) and has had affairs with Martina Navratilova, Ellen DeGeneres, k.d. lang, Melissa Etheridge and Rosie O'Donnell. In her youth, she claims to have performed oral sex on Nancy Reagan which she now regrets. Weinstein's most notable lesbian relationship was with Gussie Iscowicz (the alter ego of Bluestein's late partner Juan Montealegre), an elderly hairdresser living in Miami, Florida who suffered from Alzheimer's. For many years, Weinstein edited gay pornography for an urban audience (for a company known only as 'the Dorm'). She currently resides in Miami, Florida with her <b>Italian</b> <b>greyhound</b> Trotsky.|$|E

50|$|Some <b>Italian</b> <b>Greyhounds</b> enjoy dog agility.

50|$|As gazehounds, <b>Italian</b> <b>Greyhounds</b> instinctively hunt {{by sight}} {{and have an}} {{extremely}} high predator drive. Owners of <b>Italian</b> <b>Greyhounds</b> should typically keep their dogs leashed at all times when not in an enclosed area to avoid the risk of even a well-behaved pet breaking away at high speed after a small animal. Like most sight hounds, because the <b>Italian</b> <b>Greyhound's</b> slender skull is near the same width as its neck, {{the use of a}} Martingale Collar is advised for walking. The collar tightens up when pulled while remaining comfortably slack when the dog is walking politely. This prevents the dog from backing out and escaping. Breakaway collars are advised for identification, because this active and acrobatic breed could easily injure themselves when put in a collar they cannot escape from, and this leads to possible neck injuries and strangling.|$|R

They were extravagantly entertained in Boston. On February 5, 1778 Steuben and his party arrived in York, Pennsylvania, where the Continental Congress had relocated after being ousted from Philadelphia by the British advance. Arrangements were made for Steuben to be paid following the successful completion of the war according to his contributions. He arrived at Valley Forge on February 23, 1778, and reported for duty as a volunteer. One soldier's first impression of the Baron was [...] "of the ancient fabled God of War ... he seemed to me a perfect personification of Mars.

50|$|A Feist {{is a small}} hunting dog, {{descended from}} the terriers brought over to the United States by English miners and other working class immigrants. These terriers {{probably}} included crosses between the Smooth Fox Terrier, the Manchester Terrier and the now extinct white English Terrier. These dogs were used as ratters, and gambling on their prowess in killing rats was a favorite hobby of their owners. Some of these dogs have been crossed with Whippets or <b>Italian</b> <b>Greyhounds</b> (for speed) and Beagles (for hunting ability) - extending the family to include a larger variety of purpose than the original ratter, or Rat Terrier.|$|R
5000|$|Dogs are coursed by {{breed in}} braces (two) or trios (three), {{based on the}} number of dogs {{available}} for the run. Dogs can run alone if there are no other dogs of the same breed entered, but their scores will not qualify towards a title unless they defeat a hound in a Best of Breed run. Running order is determined by a random draw, and is not based on size or comparable ability. Dogs can compete in open stake, field champion stake (for dogs who have earned the requisite points), or veteran stake (dogs over the age of 6 years, except Irish Wolfhounds (5 years), and Whippets (7 years)). Each dog runs twice during the trial. The first run is the [...] "preliminary". After all preliminaries have been run, the course is reversed for the second run, called [...] "finals". Once all preliminaries and finals have been run, Best of Breed is determined for each breed by stakes run-off or by forfeit. All placements must be determined by total score (preliminary + final), run-off, or forfeit. After the Best of Breed runs, the top dogs from each breed compete for Best in Field to determine the best hound for the trial. Some clubs opt to provide a Best in Event which brings Best of Breed dogs from multiple days to run off. In AKC trials, <b>Italian</b> <b>Greyhounds</b> are not permitted to compete for Best In Field. This is because <b>Italian</b> <b>Greyhounds</b> have been known to be mistaken as prey by the larger sighthound breeds.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} a rat-catching dog is that of [...] "Hatch", whose remains were recovered from the Mary Rose, the flagship of Henry VIII, sunk in 1545 and re-raised in 1982. Hatch {{is thought to have}} been a mongrel, and was brought on board to control the rat population. The breed name comes from the occupation of its earliest ancestors brought to the US by working-class British migrants as the dogs were used in rat-baiting. However they were, for the most part, bred for speed. Their speed is used for controlling vermin and hunting small game such as squirrels and hares. After the 1890s, as the breed type became popular in America, Beagles, <b>Italian</b> <b>Greyhounds</b> and Miniature Pinschers were bred in. Many of the foundation Rat Terriers were indistinguishable from small mixed-breed hunting dogs known as [...] "feists". The smaller varieties diverged from the Rat Terrier line very early on, with UKC registration for the Toy Fox Terrier beginning in 1936.|$|R

60|$|Domestic breeds {{often have}} an {{abnormal}} or semi-monstrous character, as amongst dogs, the <b>Italian</b> <b>greyhound,</b> bulldog, Blenheim spaniel, and bloodhound,--some breeds of cattle and pigs,--several breeds of the fowl,--and the chief breeds of the pigeon. In such abnormal breeds, parts which differ but slightly {{or not at}} all in the allied natural species, have been greatly modified. This may be accounted for by man's often selecting, especially at first, conspicuous and semi-monstrous deviations of structure. We should, however, be cautious in deciding what deviations ought to be called monstrous: there can hardly be a doubt that, if the brush of horse-like hair on the breast of the turkey-cock had first appeared in the domesticated bird, it would have been considered as a monstrosity; the great plume of feathers on the head of the Polish cock has been thus designated, though plumes are common on the heads of many kinds of birds; we might call the wattle or corrugated skin round the base of the beak of the English carrier-pigeon a monstrosity, but we do not thus speak of the globular fleshy excrescence {{at the base of the}} beak of the Carpophaga oceanica.|$|E
60|$|The {{doctrine}} {{of the origin of}} our several domestic races from several aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors. They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. At this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many sheep, and several goats, in Europe alone, and several even within Great Britain. One author believes that there formerly existed eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to Great Britain! When we bear in mind that Britain has now not one peculiar mammal, and France but few distinct from those of Germany, and so with Hungary, Spain, etc., but that each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep, etc., we must admit that many domestic breeds must have originated in Europe; for whence otherwise could they have been derived? So it is in India. Even {{in the case of the}} breeds of the domestic dog throughout the world, which I admit are descended from several wild species, it cannot be doubted that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation; for who will believe that animals closely resembling the <b>Italian</b> <b>greyhound,</b> the bloodhound, the bull-dog, pug-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, etc.--so unlike all wild Canidae--ever existed in a state of nature? It has often been loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can only get forms in some degree intermediate between their parents; and if we account for our several domestic races by this process, we must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the <b>Italian</b> <b>greyhound,</b> bloodhound, bull-dog, etc., in the wild state. Moreover, the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated. Many cases are on record showing that a race may be modified by occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of the individuals which present the desired character; but to obtain a race intermediate between two quite distinct races would be very difficult. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimented with this object and failed. The offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with pigeons) quite uniform in character, and every thing seems simple enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for several generations, hardly two of them are alike, and then the difficulty of the task becomes manifest.|$|E
5000|$|In 1785, Frederick {{signed a}} Treaty of amity and {{commerce}} with the United States of America, recognizing {{the independence of}} the new nation.

60|$|In {{an early}} part of this chapter it was stated that Pallas (22/33. 'Act. Acad. St. Petersburg' 1780 part 2 page 84 etc.) and a few other naturalists {{maintain}} that variability is wholly due to crossing. If this means that new characters never spontaneously appear in our domestic races, but that they are all directly derived from certain aboriginal species, the doctrine is little less than absurd; for it implies that animals like <b>Italian</b> <b>greyhounds,</b> pug-dogs, bull-dogs, pouter and fantail pigeons, etc., were able to exist in a state of nature. But the doctrine may mean something widely different, namely, that the crossing of distinct species is the sole cause of the first appearance of new characters, and that without this aid man could not have formed his various breeds. As, however, new characters have appeared in certain cases by bud- variation, we may conclude with certainty that crossing is not necessary for variability. It is, moreover, certain that the breeds of various animals, such as of the rabbit, pigeon, duck, etc., and the varieties of several plants, are the modified descendants of a single wild species. Nevertheless, it is probable that the crossing of two forms, when one or both have long been domesticated or cultivated, adds to the variability of the offspring, independently of the commingling of the characters derived from the two parent-forms; and this implies that new characters actually arise. But we must not forget the facts advanced in the thirteenth chapter, which clearly prove that the act of crossing often leads to the reappearance or reversion of long- lost characters; and in most cases {{it would be impossible to}} distinguish between the reappearance of ancient characters and the first appearance of absolutely new characters. Practically, whether new or old, they would be new to the breed in which they reappeared.|$|R

6000|$|As {{changes in}} {{domestic}} breeds which take place so slowly {{are not to}} be noticed at any one period, whether due to the selection of individual variations or of differences resulting from crosses, are most important in understanding the origin of our domestic productions, and likewise in throwing indirect light on the changes effected under nature, I will give in detail such cases as I have been able to collect. Lawrence (1/82. 'The Horse in all his Varieties, etc.' 1829 pages 230, 234.), who paid particular attention to the history of the foxhound, writing in 1829, says that between eighty and ninety years before [...] "an entirely new foxhound was raised through the breeder's art," [...] the ears of the old southern hound being reduced, the bone and bulk lightened, the waist increased in length, and the stature somewhat added to. It is believed that this was effected by a cross with a greyhound. With respect to this latter dog, Youatt (1/83. 'The Dog' 1845 pages 31, 35; with respect to King Charles' spaniel page 45; for the setter page 90.), who is generally cautious in his statements, says that the greyhound within the last fifty years, that is before the commencement of the present century, [...] "assumed a somewhat different character from that which he once possessed. He is now distinguished by a beautiful symmetry of form, of which he could not once boast, and he has even superior speed to that which he formerly exhibited. He is no longer used to struggle with deer, but contends with his fellows over a shorter and speedier course." [...] An able writer (1/84. In the 'Encyclop. of Rural Sports' page 557.) believes that our English greyhounds are the descendants, PROGRESSIVELY IMPROVED, of the large rough greyhounds which existed in Scotland so early as the third century. A cross at some former period with the <b>Italian</b> <b>greyhound</b> has been suspected; but this seems hardly probable, considering the feebleness of this latter breed. Lord Orford, as is well-known, crossed his famous greyhounds, which failed in courage, with a bulldog--this breed being chosen from being erroneously supposed to be deficient in the power of scent; [...] "after the sixth or seventh generation," [...] says Youatt, [...] "there was not a vestige left of the form of the bulldog, but his courage and indomitable perseverance remained." ...|$|E
