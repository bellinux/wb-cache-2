25|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{coherence}} of provinces and federal policies a combination of policy tools have been instituted to facilitate collaboration between the federal and provincial governments. These policies tools have resulted in equal balance of federal and provincial government {{in the creation of}} energy policies. The federal government is responsible for <b>establishing</b> <b>objectives</b> for the entire country and the provincial governments are responsible for enforcing these objectives and developing the methods to achieve these goals.|$|E
25|$|Canada has {{a robust}} energy profile with {{abundant}} and diverse resources. The energy and climate policies in Canada are interrelated. These energy and climate policies are implemented {{at both the}} federal and provincial government level. The federal government is responsible for <b>establishing</b> <b>objectives</b> for the entire country and the provincial governments are responsible for enforcing these objectives and developing the methods to achieve these goals. In 2015, the federal and provincial governments created a national agreement for cooperating in boosting the nation's energy industry while transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Today, provincial governments are developing their own strategies {{in order to reach}} the national goals. The Prince Edward Island Strategy {{is one of the first}} provincial strategies developed in response to the federal agreement goals.|$|E

This resulted in the publication Goal analysis in 1972, which became a cornerstone of the CRI method and ensuing workshops.|$|E

50|$|In 1962 Preparing {{objectives}} for programmed instruction Mager pioneered {{a new approach}} to instructional design which involved <b>establishing</b> <b>objectives</b> for instruction. This made such an impact that in later editions as Preparing Instructional Objectives it became, it could be said, the manual for preparing instruction because of its clearly outlined steps on how to define objectives. It so revolutionized instructional methods in schools that a bill was passed in California that required teachers to describe what they wanted their students to achieve (i.e., behavioral outcomes) by writing these as objectives (the Stull Act, 1972).|$|E
50|$|From the start, {{the city}} {{planners}} imposed strict guidelines on the development, in particular requiring {{a substantial amount}} of development of the public realm, and sensitive preservation of existing heritage stock. In part, the city's adaption of new zoning plans in the Central Area Plan (1991) also aided in the process of rejuveation by <b>establishing</b> <b>objectives</b> of improving livability and provision for office space within Yaletown, as well as preserving its heritage structures. Thus there are generous areas set aside for parks, waterfront access, community centres, and schools. Along the shore of False Creek, the Stanley Park Seawall linear park has been continued through the area, forming its southern boundary.|$|E
5000|$|In May 1991 {{the representatives}} of 15 European {{universities}} met in the University of Bristol (UK) to discuss the theme [...] "Towards a European Universities Continuing Education Network". The represented universities were: Aalborg (DK), Aarhus (DK), Bordeaux (FR), Bristol (UK), Cambridge (UK), Exeter (UK), Galway (IE), Granada (ES), Hanover (DE), Leiden (NL), Liege (BE), Porto (PT), Oxford (UK), Pavia (IT) and Valladolid (ES). The participants at this initial meeting were invited to become the initial Full Members of eucen. The group decided that the main activities of eucen would be the exchange of information on strategies, regulations and techniques, <b>establishing</b> <b>objectives</b> and drawing up plans to meet them, enhancing international contacts, working towards setting standards of quality, agreeing routes to credit transfer and aiming at internationally recognised qualifications through Continuing Education. It was also agreed that an important role for eucen would be to inform policy makers {{and encourage them to}} decide on and set goals for Continuing Education development for the year 2000.|$|E

5000|$|Further {{barriers}} to implementation have been identified. As {{has been the}} case with other integrated approaches, time lags result from the fact that substantial time and resources are invested both in developing concepts and planning projects, while resources are less adequate for implementation, and more limited still for monitoring the outcomes. Difficulties in <b>establishing</b> <b>objectives,</b> operating norms and funding that effectively bridge different sectors can lead to operating silos(where each sector pursues its goals without giving consideration to the others), whether at the level of local actors and institutions within a landscape, national ministries, or donors. Working across sectors at the landscape scale requires a range of skills, different from those traditionally used by conservation organisations. [...] Landscape approaches rely on the engagement of multiple stakeholders, which can lead to problems of Internal/external engagement, if engagement is reduced to a box-ticking exercise or inaccessible to community participants, or powerful players such as government agencies or large companies can be deterred by a perception that there is too much participatory discussion at the expense of efficient decision-making The least developed area of landscape approaches is monitoring, to understand whether the ambitious, multiple objectives of the approach have been achieved.|$|E

40|$|The {{established}} {{approach to}} impact assessment is baseline-led, whereby {{the conditions that}} are likely to prevail {{in the absence of a}} proposed initiative are used as the "benchmarks" for determining the significance of impacts. Proponents of sustainable development (SD) criticise this approach for being directionless since it is based on extrapolating the past with no clear vision of what should be achieved in the future. <b>Establishing</b> <b>objectives</b> by which SD can be defined is one of the greatest challenges in the development of objectives-led assessment, especially since there is still so little consensus regarding exactly what SD entails.

40|$|Key {{concepts}} {{for building}} a needs assessment information system are discussed (i. e., need, needs assessment, management, and information system). For the areas of basic or general education, recreation/leisure, and work, a chart illustrates kinds of needs (i. e., normative, felt, expressed, comparative, and anticipated). Three aspects of needs assessment most critical to a postsecondary institution are: learner assessment, community assessment, and provider assessment. After <b>establishing</b> <b>objectives</b> and defining the audience for a needs-assessment study, the question of focus arises (who decides that a need exists, who has needs, what needs will be assessed, and what information is required). In addition to considering each of these questions, a classification structure for identifying needs is presented. The structure is a matrix that can focus on the following need areas for learners, th...|$|E

40|$|Economic {{activity}} in Romania has undergone significant changes {{over the last}} 20 years. Some of these changes can be classified as structural changes. Thus, in the national economy, the share of some fields has increased significantly, and the weights of others were significantly reduced.

Other changes are qualitative, {{in order to improve}} the technical level of production. Qualitative changes are reflected mainly by the significant increase in labor productivity.
