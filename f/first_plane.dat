5|$|Braathen SAFE Flight 139 was an {{aircraft}} hijacking {{that occurred in}} Norway on 21 June 1985. The incident took place on a Boeing 737-205 belonging to Braathens SAFE that was on a scheduled flight from Trondheim Airport, Værnes to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The hijacker was Stein Arvid Huseby, who was drunk {{during most of the}} incident. It was the <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> hijacking to take place in Norway; there were no deaths and no injuries. Huseby was sentenced to three years prison and five years detention.|$|E
5|$|The first 737, LN-SUS, {{landed in}} Oslo on 8 January 1969, {{followed}} by LN-SUP on 31 January. Braathens SAFE was the launch customer of the F-28, and the <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> landed in Oslo on 3 March. Five F-28s were {{delivered in the}} course of a year, in addition to one aircraft that was leased periodically until 1971. There were several technical problems due to having the earliest models of the F-28, causing some operational difficulties. Two DC-6s were sold, and all but three of the F-27s were sold to Fokker between October 1968 and May 1969. Along with the aircraft came a new simulator, and the simulator division was moved from Sola to Fornebu. On 27 February 1970, the company took into use an IT-system, based at Sola.|$|E
5|$|Sir Douglas Mawson's air-tractor sledge was a {{converted}} fixed-wing aircraft {{taken on the}} 1911–14 Australasian Antarctic Expedition, the <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> {{to be taken to}} the Antarctic. Expedition leader Douglas Mawson had planned to use the Vickers R.E.P. Type Monoplane as a reconnaissance and search and rescue tool, and to assist in publicity, but the aircraft crashed heavily during a test flight in Adelaide, Australia, only two months before Mawson's scheduled departure date. The plane was nevertheless sent south with the expedition, after having been stripped of its wings and metal sheathing from the fuselage. Engineer Frank Bickerton spent most of the 1912 winter working to convert it to a sledge, fashioning brakes from a pair of geological drills and a steering system from the plane's landing gear. It was first tested on 15November 1912 and subsequently assisted in laying depots for the summer sledging parties, but its use during the expedition was minimal.|$|E

5|$|Militants {{of unknown}} {{affiliation}} fired rockets at United Nations World Food Program (UNWFP) planes on 8 June near Luena and again near Kuito {{a few days}} later. As the <b>first</b> <b>plane,</b> a Boeing 727, approached Luena someone shot a missile at the aircraft, damaging one engine but not critically as the three-man crew landed successfully. The plane's altitude, , most likely prevented the assailant from identifying his target. As the citizens of Luena had enough food to last them several weeks, the UNFWP temporarily suspended their flights. When the flights began again a few days later, militants shot at a plane flying to Kuito, the first attack targeting UN workers since 1999. The UNWFP again suspended food aid flights throughout the country. While he did not claim responsibility for the attack, UNITA spokesman Justino said the planes carried weapons and soldiers rather than food, making them acceptable targets. UNITA and the Angolan government both said the international community needed to pressure the other side into returning to the negotiating table. Despite the looming humanitarian crisis, neither side guaranteed UNWFP planes safety. Kuito, which had relied on international aid, only had enough food to feed their population of 200,000 {{until the end of}} the week. The UNFWP had to fly in all aid to Kuito and the rest of the Central Highlands because militants ambushed trucks. Further complicating the situation, potholes in the Kuito airport strip slowed aid deliveries. Overall chaos reduced the amount of available oil to the point at which the UN had to import its jet fuel.|$|E

25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> {{landed in}} Yellow Grass on May 27, 1920, but no {{official}} airstrips have been established. The nearest municipal airport is in North Weyburn. Few {{farmers in the}} area have planes, as they are mainly used by crop spraying services.|$|E
25|$|The <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> {{landed at}} the site of the airport in 1912 and was flown by Harry Atwood, {{establishing}} a long distance flight record from Chicago, Il to Camillus. The airport expanded over the next few years and by 1925 became known as the Amboy Airport.|$|E
25|$|On July 27, 1928, the 12-passenger Boeing 80 biplane {{made its}} first flight.

25|$|The initial A-3 Falcon {{order was}} placed in the winter of 1927 and {{delivery}} of the <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> was in October 1927. A total of 76 A-3s were received. Later, six aircraft were modified as pilot trainers with dual controls and redesignated A-3A. A second batch of 78 improved A-3Bs, based on the Curtiss O-1E, was purchased beginning in 1929.|$|E
25|$|On September 6, 1982, the {{governor}} of Kumamoto Prefecture announced plans for a small airport during a regular press conference. On December 26, 1990, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport approved {{the construction of the}} airfield. Construction began in 1992. The <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> that landed at this airport was a DHC-8 of Amakusa Airlines on November 19, 1999. The airfield was opened for public use on March 23, 2000.|$|E
50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>planes</b> were a {{small number}} of Handley Page Type O/400 bombers {{modified}} for passenger use. These flew London-Paris. At a request from the Air Ministry the Handley Page Type W8 was later used for both Paris and Brussels.|$|R
25|$|In March 1956, the Civil Aeronautics Board {{approved}} routes out of Tucson for Trans World Airlines (TWA), {{in spite}} of opposition from the already established American Airlines but it wouldn't be until December of that year that the <b>first</b> <b>planes</b> began service.|$|R
50|$|The <b>first</b> {{prototype}} Eurofighter <b>planes</b> {{used the}} RB199 engine, until in June 1995 when the <b>first</b> EJ200-engined <b>plane</b> {{took off from}} Turin. Its predecessor, the British Aerospace EAP, also used the engines.|$|R
25|$|In 1991, Clark Air Base in the Philippines was {{evacuated}} due to {{the eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo. By 16 June, the evacuation order was issued and the <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> load of evacuees arrived at McChord on the 18th. In 1992, with the disestablishment of Military Airlift Command, McChord became an Air Mobility Command base. In November of that same year, two McChord C-141 Starlifters, participating in an air refueling training mission over north central Montana, collided in mid-air, killing all 13 crewmen.|$|E
25|$|While {{the final}} project was being prepared, the Portuguese Department of Defense {{authorized}} immediate {{execution of the}} first work, that included a runway to service planes transferred from Lajes Airfield, carrying with them the technicians and equipment. Along {{with a team of}} little more than 40 workers, Lieutenant Engineer Correia de Sousa concluded the runway construction. On 8 August 1944, at about 2:15p.m., the <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> landed on the runway, a Douglas C-47 Skytrain (Dakota C-47) operated by the US Air Force, transporting materials and bread from Terceira. It departed an hour later.|$|E
25|$|The {{military}} {{believes that}} {{the target of the}} <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> was either the Sri Lanka Air Force Headquarters, which was adjacent to the Inland Revenue Department building, or the President's House or Army Headquarters, which were also in the area. However, after the aircraft was hit, the pilot lost control and crashed into the IRD building. The second aircraft is believed to have targeted aircraft hangars at the Air Force base at Katunayake. Given the amount of explosives packed inside the aircraft, there could have been severe devastation if they had hit their targets.|$|E

The manipulation device is designed to align the <b>first</b> detection <b>plane</b> of the <b>first</b> detector module with the second detection plane of the second detector module such that a first surface normal of the <b>first</b> detection <b>plane</b> and a second surface normal of the second detection plane intersect in a reference region...|$|R
25|$|Following {{a lengthy}} {{recording}} hiatus, An Evening with Harry Belafonte and Friends, a soundtrack and {{video of a}} televised concert, were released in 1997 by Island Records. , a huge multi-artist project recorded by RCA during the 1960s and 1970s, was finally released by the label in 2001. Belafonte went on the Today Show to promote the album on September 11, 2001, and was interviewed by Katie Couric just minutes before the <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> hit the World Trade Center. The album was nominated for the 2002 Grammy Awards for Best Boxed Recording Package, for Best Album Notes, and for Best Historical Album.|$|E
25|$|USAir was {{a launch}} {{customer}} for the Boeing 737-300, as the airline needed an aircraft with greater capacity to serve its rapidly growing Florida markets. USAir was the world's largest operator of DC-9 aircraft {{at the time}} and approached McDonnell Douglas to negotiate a new airplane design. However, in the late 1970s, the McDonnell Douglas' proposed successor to the DC-9-50 did not suit USAir's requirements. After the negotiations with McDonnell Douglas broke down, Boeing came forward with a proposed variant of the 737. USAir selected the new 737 aircraft and the company worked closely with Boeing during its development, taking delivery of the <b>first</b> <b>plane</b> on November 28, 1984.|$|E
25|$|Braathens South American & Far East Airtransport A/S {{was founded}} on 26 March 1946 by Ludvig G. Braathen through his {{shipping}} company Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi and its holding company Braganza. Braathens had made good money during World War II with the participation in the Norwegian Shipping and Trade Mission. His initial intentions were to fly crew and supplies to his and others ships throughout the world—primarily in the Far East. Braathen traveled to the United States, where he bought several used 44-passenger Douglas C-54 (DC-4) aircraft from the United States Air Force. Twenty pilots were recruited and sent to Fort Worth for certification. The <b>first</b> <b>plane,</b> LN-HAV Norse Explorer, landed at Oslo Airport, Gardermoen on 26 December 1946.|$|E
