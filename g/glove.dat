Managers are not permitted to vote for their own players. Additionally, a sabermetric component provided by Society for American Baseball Research (SABR) accounts for approximately 25 percent of the vote. Eighteen Gold Gloves are awarded each year (with the exception of 1957, 1985 and 2007), one at each of the nine positions in each league. In 1957, the baseball <b>glove</b> manufacturer Rawlings created the Gold <b>Glove</b> Award to commemorate the best fielding performance at each position. The award was created from a <b>glove</b> made from gold lamé-tanned leather and affixed to a walnut base. Initially, only one Gold <b>Glove</b> per position was awarded to the top fielder at each position in Major League Baseball; however, separate awards were given for the National and American Leagues beginning in 1958.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gloves</b> {{are used}} in the Foodservice Industry for {{minimizing}} contact with ready to eat foods.

Latex, Vinyl and Nitrile <b>gloves</b> are available in powder and powder-free varieties. The powder in the <b>gloves</b> are made of USDA cornstarch. Powder-free <b>gloves</b> are generally more expensive than powdered <b>gloves</b> because <b>gloves</b> must be powdered to be removed from the mold they are made on.

5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 11, 1957, {{plutonium}} shavings in a <b>glove</b> box located in building 771 (the Plutonium Recovery and Fabrication Facility) spontaneously ignited. The fire spread to the flammable <b>glove</b> box materials, including plexiglas windows and rubber gloves. The fire rapidly spread through the interconnected <b>glove</b> boxes and ignited the large bank of High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters located in a plenum downstream. Within minutes the first filters had burned out, allowing plutonium particles {{to escape from the}} building exhaust stacks. The building exhaust fans stopped operating due to fire damage at 10:40 PM, which ended the majority of the plutonium release. Fire fighters initially used carbon dioxide fire extinguishers because water can act as a moderator and cause plutonium to go critical. They resorted to water hoses when the dry fire extinguishers proved ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Polonium and its {{compounds}} must {{be handled}} in a <b>glove</b> box, which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the <b>glove</b> box to prevent the radioactive materials from leaking out.

Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|E
