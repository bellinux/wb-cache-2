25|$|Real Madrid's La Liga {{campaign}} {{was scheduled to}} begin on August 21 at home against Athletic Bilbao, but the Spanish Footballers' Association, with representation from all 42 teams in the top two divisions, unanimously elected to strike after failing to reach a collective bargaining agreement with the Liga de Fútbol Profesional, causing the postponement of the first weekend of fixtures. The team won their seventh consecutive Santiago Bernabéu Trophy, defeating Turkish Süper Lig side Galatasaray on August 24. Before the match, Real Madrid officially presented their five new summer signings and honored their three youth team players on the Spanish Under-19 squad that won the 2011 UEFA European Under-19 Football Championship. Selçuk İnan scored early for Galatasaray from close range, but a pair of assists from man of the match Xabi Alonso to Sergio Ramos and Benzema led Real Madrid to a 2–1 victory in the annual friendly. Real Madrid's La Liga season began with a 0–6 win at Real Zaragoza on August 28, with goals from Marcelo, Alonso, Kaká and a hat-trick by Ronaldo, including his 100th goal as a Real Madrid player. The win was the most lopsided away victory on opening day in Spanish top <b>flight</b> <b>history.</b>|$|E

Although standard missions {{have been developed for}} design of military aircraft, stress values based on data obtained from flight data recorders can differ significantly from the design values. In this paper, a comprehensive framework is presented for probabilistic treatment of aircraft engine usage that consists of the following four stages: (1) data retrieval, (2) mission identification, (3) stress characterization, and (4) risk prediction. An example is presented that illustrates the approach for a number of actual <b>flight</b> <b>histories.</b> The framework can be applied to quantitative risk predictions of gas turbine engine components for enhanced life management, including potential life extension and associated cost savings...|$|R
