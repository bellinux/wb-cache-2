30|$|Productivity maps {{based on}} {{harvester}} data {{are used in}} agriculture. The concept behind the usefulness of yield maps is to evaluate the variation in productivity across the area based on its real <b>harvested</b> <b>production.</b> Having this information at hand provides practitioners with useful information to manage sites specifically according to their characteristics (topography, soil, water availability, fertility, etc.) and potential for improving profitability and reducing environmental impact through more targeted applications of fertilisers and or pesticides. The required equipment for collecting data for mapping productivity is a harvester equipped with a yield sensor (determined using either mass flow or volumetric methodology) and a global navigation satellite system (GNSS), preferably with a differential correction system to improve accuracy (Bongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer 2006; Griffin 2010; Zhang et al. 2002).|$|E

40|$|The below-harvest {{nitrogen}} accumulating in stubble, stolons {{and roots}} {{is an important}} com-ponent in the N balance and the potential N losses in grass-clover cropping systems. The effects of cutting frequency on the total dry matter, total nitrogen and N 2 fixation, including contributions from below-harvest production, were studied. In a greenhouse experiment with red and white clover plants, cutting reduced the above-ground dry matter production by 56 - 62 % and the below-ground by 68 - 73 %, compared to uncut plants. Similarly, in a two-year field study with ryegrass-white clover, simulated grazing reduced the harvested dry matter production by 6 - 19 % and the below-harvest, i. e., stubble, stolons and roots, by 20 - 35 % com-pared to normally mowed grass-clover.

In Sicily, more than half of greenhouse tomato production is derived from the Province of Ragusa on the southeastern coast, where especially cherry tomato typologies are cultivated. Over the last decade, the Ragusa Province has registered a decrease both in terms of greenhouse tomato area and <b>harvested</b> <b>production</b> due to several structural problems that would require restructuring of the tomato supply chain. Thus, since recognition of real costs and profitability of tomato growing is a vital issue, both from the perspective of the farm, as well as from that of the entrepreneur, the aim of this paper was to analyze the economic sustainability of Sicilian greenhouse cherry tomato cultivated in the Ragusa Province. In particular, an economic analysis on 30 representative farms was conducted in order to estimate production costs and profits of greenhouse cherry tomato.

40|$|In {{terms of}} production, area planted and more importantly, {{the number of}} {{dependent}} families, cassava {{is one of the}} most important crops in the contemporary world, probably next only to the prominent three food crops, rice, wheat and maize. The fact that cassava attained the greatest leap in production and the area harvested and one of the highest yield improvement among the world’s major food crops in the last 30 years suggests the great potential of cassava for future as well. In a worldwide comparison among the three major root crops, i. e. potato, sweet potato and cassava, cassava is now the first in total area <b>harvested,</b> <b>production</b> (calorie basis) and yield (calorie basis). In the last 30 years, the area planted with potato and sweet potato actually decreased and the yield mostly stagnated. In contrast, during the same period, cassava production more than doubled in Africa and Asia, in the former mainly due to the increase in area and in the latter, very dominantly due to the improvement in yield. The inherent strength of cassava in producing robust yields even under harsh conditions may be the main reason for cassava’s success in Africa.

40|$|Problem statement: Sugarcane leaf-removing tools {{could help}} speed up {{sugarcane}} harvest and reduce contamination. Moreover, leaf-removal machinery can {{solve the problems}} of sugarcane burning and workers can increase sugarcane <b>harvest</b> <b>production</b> too. The purpose of this research was to study the use of leaf-removal machinery in the post-harvest production of sugarcane to reduce <b>harvest</b> <b>production</b> time and contaminant. Approach: This study focused on the LK 92 - 11 variety of sugarcane having a harvesting period of 12 months, a density of 9, 387 stems/rai and could produce 14. 01 tons/rai including cane top and, leaves and leaf sheaths of 1675. 2 and 180 kg/rai. Sugarcane leaf-removal machinery was applied to a small engine power from a grass-cutting machine. A rotate dish applied 4 different materials, tendon string, soft wire, medium wire and sling for sugarcane leaf-removing. The machine was operated at a constant speed. The efficiency of the sugarcane leaf-removal machinery indicated the capacity of sugarcane leaf-removing by area and operation time. Results: The quantity of leaves and leaf sheaths affect the speed of <b>harvest</b> <b>production.</b> Moreover, leaves and leaf sheaths increase the waste material in production and also contaminate the sugar and the sugar production system with clay, sand, and mud from the fields. Traditional methods for sugarcane harvest without removing leaf took 37 h/rai to complete, but sugarcane leaf-removing could reduce the sugarcane harvest process to 11. 4 h/rai. Conclusion: The material of the blades in de-leafing machine is crucial to the efficiency of <b>harvest</b> <b>production</b> time. Blades made from poor materials can cause tangling and clogging in the rotator dish, which increases maintenance time. Further developments in sugarcane leaf removal systems will create dramatic improvement in sugarcane production...|$|R

Sampling of damage was stratified by producer expectation of likely wildlife damage or unlikely wildlife damage. Damage was assessed immediately before harvest. Two plots that measured 4. 5 m x 2 rows were assessed in each selected field. Of assessed fields, wildlife damage was present in 340 of 1, 259 (27. 0 %) likely damaged fields and 108 of 1, 243 (8. 7 %) unlikely damaged fields. As a percentage of <b>harvested</b> <b>production,</b> birds (Aves) damaged an average of 0. 19 % of field corn while deer (Odocoileus spp.) damaged an average of 0. 23 % of field corn. Unidentified wildlife caused the loss of an additional 0. 27 % of corn. The average yield loss was 1. 73 + 0. 17 bu/ha. Loss rates were greater where producers had expected damage (3. 7 bu/ha) than where damage had not been anticipated (1. 5 bu/ha). Among states, yield lost to all wildlife differed among 3 groups of states. Wisconsin and Missouri had the greatest wildlife-caused loss rates. Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, and Ohio had intermediate loss rates. Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, and South Dakota had lower loss rates. In total, an estimated 35 + 4 million bushels of corn were lost to wildlife in 1993 when harvested field corn production for the 10 selected states totaled 5. 14 billion bushels.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} innovative in-field {{data monitoring}} systems, especially during manual fruit harvesting, for “in field traceability”, yield mapping {{as well as}} for providing information on efficiency and working hours of an individual worker (monitor farm labor). First of all, this thesis introduces UML and hybrid Petri nets into modeling for farm work flow and flow of information in hand <b>harvested</b> <b>production,</b> as an industrial procedure. The main emphasis is on the construction of an adequate model for extracting the traceability-related information from the data from all the sensors, for providing the proof needed to meet compliance standards. Hence, technologies and methods can be adopted, based on the previous analysis, which rely on a multitude of sensors attached to infrastructure (ambient) and to the workers (wearable), in order to collect the necessary information. In addition, an algorithm was developed to simulate each stage of the harvesting procedure (in MATLAB®), based on UML analysis. The analysis and the modeling of all activities involved in the manual harvesting procedure provided input to advanced automatic data monitoring systems. Hence, a multitude of sensors were selected and methodologies were developed, based on the analysis, in order to register the essential activities during manual harvesting of specialty crops. The goal is the achievement of full scale traceability and yield mapping i. e., to know the origin of fruit or vegetable, who picked it and when, the association between bins and trees, etc. Thus, innovation systems and methods, for automatic data acquisition, were developed and evaluated, which rely on GPS, RFID and barcode technologies as well as on a human motion tracking system (wearable dead reckoning module). In these systems each resource, which is involved in the production, is identified uniquely, providing, in a future system, a type of ambient intelligence regarding to the recognition of agricultural work which is executed based on the “state” of the entity that executes him. ...|$|E
40|$|The Johnson County Landfill in Shawnee, KS is {{operated}} by Deffenbaugh Industries and serves much of metropolitan Kansas City. Refuse, which is dumped in large plastic-underlined trash cells covering several acres, is covered over with shale shortly after burial. The landfill waste, once it fills the cell, is then drilled by Kansas City LFG, {{so that the}} gas generated by anaerobic decomposition of the refuse can be <b>harvested.</b> <b>Production</b> of raw landfill gas from the Johnson County landfill comes from 150 wells. Daily production is approximately 2. 2 to 2. 5 mmcf, of which approximately 50 % is methane and 50 % is carbon dioxide and NMVOCs (non-methane volatile organic compounds). Heating value is approximately 550 BTU/scf. A upgrading plant, utilizing an amine process, rejects the carbon dioxide and NMVOCs, and upgrades the gas to pipeline quality (i. e., nominally a heating value > 950 BTU/scf). The gas is sold to a pipeline adjacent to the landfill. With coal-bearing strata underlying the landfill, and carbon dioxide a major effluent gas derived from the upgrading process, the Johnson County Landfill is potentially an ideal setting to study the feasibility of injecting the effluent gas in the coals for both enhanced coalbed methane recovery and carbon sequestration. To these ends, coals below the landfill were cored and then were analyzed for their thickness and sorbed gas content, which ranged up to 79 scf/ton. Assuming 1 1 / 2 square miles of land (960 acres) at the Johnson County Landfill can be utilized for coalbed and shale gas recovery, {{the total amount of}} in-place gas calculates to 946, 200 mcf, or 946. 2 mmcf, or 0. 95 bcf (i. e., 985. 6 mcf/acre X 960 acres). Assuming that carbon dioxide can be imbibed by the coals and shales on a 2 : 1 ratio compared to the gas that was originally present, then 1682 to 1720 days (4. 6 to 4. 7 years) of landfill carbon dioxide production can be sequestered by the coals and shales immediately under the landfill. Three coal [...] the Bevier, Fleming, and Mulberry coals [...] are the major coals of sufficient thickness (nominally > 1 -foot) that can imbibe carbon dioxide gas with an enhanced coalbed injection. Comparison of the adsorption gas content of coals to the gas desorbed from the coals shows that the degree of saturation decreases with depth for the coals...|$|E
40|$|L'éleveur doit en {{permanence}} concilier 2 objectifs contradictoires : maximiser l'ingestion et les performances animales individuelles, et maîtriser la hauteur d'herbe résiduelle. Pour gérer au mieux le pâturage, il est utile de connaître les répercussions de la hauteur et du rythme d'exploitation sur la repousse et la composition morphologique du couvert. Un essai conduit pendant 2 ans met en évidence que, après des coupes moyennes à hautes, la repousse est rapide et la sénescence précoce des limbes impose une exploitation à un rythme rapide (2 semaines environ). Mais après des coupes rases, la prairie repousse lentement et son entrée en sénescence est retardée, ce qui permet d'allonger l'intervalle entre exploitations d'une semaine. Ce mode d'exploitation ras génère peu de tiges, de gaines et de sénescence, et préserve la qualité des repousses. Le taux de défoliation, intégrant les hauteurs du couvert à l'entrée et à la sortie des animaux, {{permet de}} situer la fin du pâturage en préservant les performances animales. Un rapport limbes/gaines élevé assure les meilleures productions animales. Good grazing management requires {{the knowledge of}} the effects of cutting height and cutting rate on the regrowth and the morphological make-up of the sward. A trial carried out for 2 years showed that the <b>harvested</b> <b>production</b> was significantly larger when the cutting frequence was low, especially with close (3 cm) cuts. The residual biomass of culms varied from 878 to 2280 kg DM/ha when the cutting height increased from 3 to 9 cm; delayed cuttings magnified these differences. Besides, Perennial Ryegrass, when cut frequently, gave few ears; with delayed cuts, the number of ears was linked directly to the cutting height. After medium-low or high cuts, regrowth was fast and early senescence of the blades dictated a frequent cutting rate : intervals of 2 weeks in spring, of 20 days at the end of summer. On the contrary, after close cuts, regrowth was slow, and the beginning of senescence delayed, so that the intervals between cuts could be lengthened by one week. This type of management with close cuts created few ears, few sheaths, and little senescence, and the quality of aftermaths was preserved. In successive grazings, the animals ate that part of the herbage which was above the residual height of the previous cycle; the herbage thus ingested had a good digestibility. A high blade/sheath ratio leads to the largest animal yields. The defoliation rate, which takes into account the residual height and the sward height at turnout to the pasture, indicates when the grazing should be ended if the animal performances are to be preserved...|$|E
