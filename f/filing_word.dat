As {{e-learning}} or {{blended learning}} {{is more and}} more popular these days, but with the lack of certain tools, most of the e-learning objects are just simple power point <b>files,</b> pdf <b>files,</b> <b>word</b> documents, HTML <b>files</b> or simple flash files uploaded to a Learning Management System. On many occasions, instructors cannot devote sufficient energy nor time to develop more interesting flash or animations for their subjects. In this paper, we proposed a scenario building and execution tool that supports the learning and application of knowledge harnessing and sharing techniques for knowledge management subjects. This system takes a Web 2. 0 approach which ultimately not only instructors but learners can also contribute to scenario building and executions...|$|R
