5|$|Violence {{against women}} may take many forms, {{including}} physical, sexual, emotional and psychological and may occur throughout the life-course. Structural violence may be embedded in legislation or policy, or be systematic misogyny by organisations against groups of women. Perpetrators of personal violence include state actors, strangers, acquaintances, relatives and intimate partners and manifests itself across a spectrum from discrimination, through harassment, sexual assault and rape, and physical harm to murder (<b>femicide).</b> It may also include cultural {{practices such as}} female genital cutting.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, Guatemala {{became the}} first country to officially {{recognize}} <b>femicide,</b> {{the murder of a}} female because of her gender, as a crime. Guatemala has the third highest <b>femicide</b> rate in the world, after El Salvador and Jamaica, with around 9.1 murders every 100,000 women from 2007 to 2012.|$|E
50|$|The {{causes of}} {{the high level of}} <b>femicides</b> in Honduras are varied, {{although}} one of the principal causes is the lack of legal repercussions. Ninety percent of murders go without investigation, consequently the number of <b>femicides</b> continues to grow.|$|R

25|$|In {{examining}} <b>femicide</b> in Ciudad Juárez, it {{is important}} to consider the impact of the drug trade. Juárez is the seat of the Mexican drug cartel which has resulted in high levels of violence that have been directed at the Mexican population. It is believed that the <b>femicide</b> in Ciudad Juárez may be related to the powerful drug cartels along the border. Further, gangs have become a permanent threat particularly to women on the border. Gang activity creates high risk for women especially due to very little institutional protection.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} also {{state that}} <b>femicide</b> rates in Ciudad Juárez {{are lower than}} in American cities such as Houston and Ensenada, and {{as a share of}} overall homicide rates they are typically lower than in other cities.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that the <b>femicide</b> in Ciudad Juárez {{may be related to}} organized crime (like prostitution rings) given the presence of the powerful drug cartels in the region. Further, criminal gangs have become a permanent threat particularly to women on the border. Gang activity creates high risk for women especially due to very little institutional protection.|$|E
25|$|This patriarchal {{backlash}} {{may indeed}} {{be the result of}} lack of employment opportunities for men and more women entering the workforce which has altered traditional gender dynamics and created a situation of conflict between the sexes. Other researchers attribute the murders to Mexico's structural crisis including increasing poverty, unemployment, the disintegration of the peasant economy, migration, and a dysfunctional justice system. Overall, in considering the potential motives for gendered violence against women, academic Mercedes Olivera has argued that <b>femicide</b> is a mechanism of domination, control, oppression, and power over women.|$|E
25|$|Domestic {{violence}} {{was not a}} part of the Brazilian criminal code until 2006, when the federal criminal domestic violence code was passed by President Lula. The Law of Domestic and Family Violence was the first official codification of domestic violence crimes, and tripled the previous punishments associated with domestic violence. Brazil's adoption of the domestic violence code was mainly influenced by its participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), the urging of the international legal community, and the tenacity of local grassroots movements. The formation of women's police units and a federally funded hotline to serve victims of gender violence have significantly advanced the protections offered to women in Brazil, though domestic violence in Brazil remains prevalent and thus a major obstacle in attaining equal rights for women. In 2015, Brazil enacted a law against <b>femicide.</b>|$|E

25|$|After 1997, when PRI {{lost control}} of the legislature, female activists and victims’ {{relatives}} in Chihuahua convinced the state government to create special law enforcement divisions to address disappearances and deaths of women in Ciudad Juarez. Success in the state legislature led to a similar law at the national level, which also aimed at investigating and prosecution of Dirty War and narco-trafficking disappearances. By 2004 the violence toward women had escalated to the point that María Marcela Lagarde y de los Ríos introduced the term <b>femicide,</b> originally coined in the United States, to Latin American audiences to refer to abductions, death and disappearances of women and girls which is allowed by the state and happens with impunity. In 2006, the Mexican Congress adopted the term accepting that it points to the State's responsibility and in 2009 the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued a verdict against Mexico condemning the failure to protect hundreds of murdered women in Ciudad Juarez.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Femicide</b> {{is usually}} {{defined as the}} gender-based killing of women by men, {{although}} the exact definitions vary. [...] Femicides often occur {{in the context of}} DV, such as honor killings or dowry killings. For statistical purposes, <b>femicide</b> is often defined as any killing of a woman. The top countries by rate of <b>femicide</b> are El Salvador, Jamaica, Guatemala, South Africa and Russia (data from 2004–09). However, in El Salvador and Colombia, which have a very high rate of <b>femicide,</b> only three percent of all femicides are committed by a current or former intimate partner, while in Cyprus, France, and Portugal former and current partners are responsible for more than 80% of all cases of <b>femicide.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Some {{scholarly}} publications on infanticide use {{the legal}} definition. Others, {{such as the}} collaboration of Renu Dube, Reena Dube and Rashmi Bhatnagar, who describe themselves as [...] "postcolonial feminists", adopt a broader scope for infanticide, applying it from foeticide through to <b>femicide</b> at an unspecified age. Barbara Miller, an anthropologist, has [...] "for convenience" [...] used the term to refer to all non-accidental deaths of children up {{to the age of}} around 15–16, which is culturally considered to be the age when childhood ends in rural India. She notes that the act of infanticide can be [...] "outright", such as a physical beating, or take a [...] "passive" [...] form through actions such as neglect and starvation. Neonaticide, being the killing of a child within 24 hours of birth, is sometimes considered as a separate study.|$|E
2500|$|Indigenous {{feminism}} developed {{out of a}} need {{to prioritize}} the issues indigenous women face due to race, ethnicity, and cultural differences, in addition to sex and gender. The ongoing attempted genocide of indigenous women, is of utmost priority in indigenous feminism, while in mainstream feminism this <b>femicide</b> is rarely prioritized, unless it is non-indigenous women being murdered. Indigenous feminism has grown from postcolonial feminism as it acknowledges the devastating consequences of colonization on Indigenous peoples and the lands they inhabit, {{and the importance of}} decolonization in dismantling oppressive systems that were introduced as a result of colonization. The central role of the ancestral landbase, and current land rights and environmental struggles, connects Indigenous feminism to some aspects of ecofeminism. Differentiating indigenous feminism from mainstream white feminism and its related forms of feminism (including liberal feminism and Orientalist feminism) is important because [...] "indigenous women will have different concrete experiences that shape our relation to core themes" [...] than those of non-indigenous women.|$|E
2500|$|In Mexico, where 6.34% of {{the female}} {{population}} has a child between the age of 15 and 19, {{there are some who}} make a conscious choice against motherhood. For some, becoming a nun offers a way out domesticity, machismo, and a lack of educational opportunity toward a more socially responsible path. Those in orders who see their work as allies of the poor and imbued with a mission for social justice, have increasingly been characterized as feminists and having [...] "a certain secularist mentality". Mexico's nuns who work along the US/Mexico border with migrants experience difficulties trying to balance strict Catholic doctrine against suffering that they see and some believe the church needs to take a more humanitarian approach. [...] Similarly, those, who are working to bring visibility to <b>femicide</b> and halting violence against women, seek [...] "to realize the humanity in all of us regardless of our religious beliefs". An organization called the Rede Latinoamericana de Católicas (Latin American Catholic Network) has {{gone so far as to}} send a letter to Pope Francis supporting feminism, women's rights to life and health, their quest for social justice and their rights to make their own choices regarding sexuality, reproduction and abortion.|$|E

40|$|Background: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of <b>femicides</b> in Italy {{over the last three}} years and the potential long lasting effects of these traumatic events for the children of a woman who dies a violent death. Methods: The data used in this study come from an internet search for the number of <b>femicides</b> occurring in Italy between 1 st January, 2012 and 31 st October, 2014. Results: The total number of <b>femicides</b> was 319; the average age of murdered women was 47. 50 ∈±∈ 19. 26. Cold arms in the form of sharp object -mostly knives- have caused the death of 102 / 319 women; firearms were used in 87 / 319 cases; asphyxiation was the chosen method in 52 / 319 cases. About the place where the <b>femicides</b> occurred, 209 / 319 were committed inside the victim's house. Children of women who died a violent death were 417 with a total of 180 minors in less than three years. A total of 52 / 417 children were witness to the killing and, among these 30 / 52 were minors; in 18 / 417 cases, children were murdered together with their mother and among these 9 / 18 were minors. Conclusions: Long-term studies are needed to ascertain what happens to these children, to understand what are the most appropriate psychological treatments, the best decisions about the contact with their father and the best placement for these children...|$|R
50|$|The {{manifestations of}} <b>femicide</b> vary greatly. Using Diana Russell's definition, <b>femicide</b> {{includes}} intimate partner <b>femicide,</b> lesbicide, racial <b>femicide,</b> serial <b>femicide,</b> mass <b>femicide,</b> honor killing related <b>femicide,</b> dowry and more. Any act of sexual terrorism {{that results in}} death is considered a <b>femicide.</b> This includes forms of covert <b>femicide</b> as well, such as criminalization of abortion that leads to death from unsafe abortions, or death {{as a result of}} female genital mutilation.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, authors Desmond Ellis and Walter Dekesedery take a {{different}} approach by viewing the definition for <b>femicide</b> as [...] "the intentional killing of females by males". These feminists require that <b>femicide</b> always be intentional unlike the inclusion of covert <b>femicide</b> in Diana Russell's definition.|$|E
5000|$|All {{of these}} {{definitions}} {{refer to the}} idea that <b>femicide</b> is unique from non-gendered descriptions of murder and homicide. Instead, defining <b>femicide</b> exemplifies the fact that women are killed for different reasons and motives from those associated with typical descriptions of murder. Globally, <b>femicide</b> has seldom been investigated separately from homicide, and the goals of many of these authors is to make <b>femicide</b> a separate category. In 2013, COST set up Action IS-1206 entitled [...] "Femicide across Europe".|$|E
