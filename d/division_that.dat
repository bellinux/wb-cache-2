5|$|A set {{procedure}} {{was used by}} a <b>division</b> <b>that</b> was moving into the front line. Once they had been informed that they were moving forward, the brigadiers and battalion commanders would {{be taken to the}} forward areas to reconnoitre the sections of the front that were to be occupied by their troops. Meanwhile, the battalion transport officers would be taken to the headquarters of the <b>division</b> <b>that</b> they were relieving to observe the methods used for drawing rations and ammunition, {{and the manner in which}} they were supplied to the troops at the front. Detachments from the divisional artillery group would move forward and were attached to the artillery batteries of the division they were relieving. Five days later, the infantry battalions that were destined for the front line sent forward their specialists from the Lewis gun teams, and the grenade officer, the machine gun officer, the four company commanders, and some of the signallers to take over the trench stores and settle into the trench routine before the battalions moved in. Overnight, the battalions would move into the line, and the artillery would take over the guns that were already in position, leaving theirs behind to be taken over by the batteries that had been relieved.|$|E
5|$|Although {{mechanisation}} of the British cavalry {{was well}} advanced by 1939, {{there was still}} a 1st Cavalry <b>Division</b> <b>that</b> served in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign during the Second World War. Eventually all the cavalry regiments were mechanised and became part of the Household Cavalry and the Royal Armoured Corps. There is still one regiment that retains their horses, the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, which together with the Household Cavalry Regiment was formed from the Life Guards and the Blues and Royals, which was itself an amalgamation of the Royal Horse Guards (Blues) and the 1st (Royal) Dragoons.|$|E

5|$|At the Milkhailovka bridgehead, {{just south}} of Belgorod, eight {{infantry}} battalions of the 6th Panzer Division crossed the river under heavy Soviet bombardment. Part of a company of Tigers from the 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion was able to cross before the bridge was destroyed. The rest of the 6th Panzer Division was unable to cross further south due to a traffic jam at the crossing, and remained on the western {{bank of the river}} throughout the day. Those units of the <b>division</b> <b>that</b> had crossed the river attacked Stary Gorod, but were unable to break through due to poorly cleared minefields and strong resistance.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, Braithwaite, a popular commander, was {{temporarily}} in charge of the division while Russell was on leave. The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was worn out and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the <b>division</b> <b>that</b> this was a punishment for his refusal to carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E

5|$|German {{reaction}} to the second airborne landings involved mortar barrages and small arms fire, but casualties were negligible. Generalmajor Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division watched the gliders descending and, believing the arriving force would threaten his lines of communication, ordered those elements of the <b>division</b> <b>that</b> had reached the beaches to withdraw {{to the north of}} Caen. The gliders' arrival had inadvertently stopped the only German armoured attack on D-Day.|$|E
5|$|Grant's Union Army of the Tennessee of the District of Cairo {{consisted}} of three divisions, commanded by Brig. Gens. McClernand, C.F. Smith, and Lew Wallace. (At {{the start of the}} attack on Fort Donelson, Wallace was a brigade commander in reserve at Fort Henry, but was summoned on February 14 and charged with assembling a new <b>division</b> <b>that</b> included reinforcements arriving by steamship, including Charles Cruft's brigade on loan from Buell.) Two regiments of cavalry and eight batteries of artillery supported the infantry divisions. Altogether, the Union forces numbered nearly 25,000 men, although {{at the start of the}} battle, only 15,000 were available.|$|E

5|$|In January 1940, Miles was {{promoted}} to brigadier and seconded to the newly raised 2nd New Zealand Division as its commander, Royal Artillery. His command consisted of three field regiments, one for each brigade of the division, {{as well as an}} anti-tank regiment. In March 1940, he was dispatched to Egypt, where the first elements of the division had arrived, but was then sent to England, where he would {{spend the rest of the}} year. Here he commanded a portion of the <b>division</b> <b>that</b> had been diverted there while in transit. An initial attempt to join the main part of the division in the Middle East in October 1940 was foiled when the ship he was travelling on was bombed and forced to return to England.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dartmouth College case (supra), there are other reports of certificates of <b>division</b> <b>that</b> were issued but never decided by the Supreme Court. After the indictment of Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, for treason, William Wirt Henry reports that a certificate of division was issued on Davis's motion to dismiss the indictment {{on the grounds that}} he owed no allegiance to the United States after the secession of his state. Reportedly, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase sided with Davis, while District Judge John Curtiss Underwood sided with the government. No response from the Supreme Court to that certificate is reported, but Davis's bail was eventually absolved, and he was released.|$|E
5|$|In {{the war for}} independence, the {{division}} of assimilados versus indigenas peoples masked the inter-ethnic conflict between the various native tribes, a <b>division</b> <b>that</b> emerged in the early 1970s. The Union of Peoples of Angola, the predecessor to the FNLA, only controlled 15% of Angola's territory during the independence war, excluding MPLA-controlled Cabinda. The People's Republic of China openly backed UNITA upon independence despite the mutual support from its adversary South Africa and UNITA's pro-Western tilt. The PRC's support for Savimbi came in 1965, a year {{after he left the}} FNLA. China saw Holden Roberto and the FNLA as the stooge of the West and the MPLA as the Soviet Union's proxy. With the Sino-Soviet split, South Africa presented the least odious of allies to the PRC.|$|E

5|$|On 14August1942, Herring {{was ordered}} to Esk, Queensland, to assume command of II Corps with the {{temporary}} rank of Lieutenant General.

At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th <b>Division</b> <b>that</b> no officer was to be commissioned unless they had at least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation reflected a suspicion that Herring was an elitist.|$|E
