5|$|The {{record is}} known for the {{difficulty}} Priestess encountered in trying to release it. The band's extensive touring schedule for their previous album Hello Master consumed {{much of the time}} they would <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> write new material, and after they began doing so, they had disputes with RCA Records, their international distributor at the time, as to whether the new songs were acceptable. After the completion of the recording sessions, which were themselves problematic, RCA ultimately refused to release the album, fearing it was not commercial enough, but allowed the group to release it on another label. Tee Pee Records signed the group thereafter and released the album internationally. Priestess were still signed to Indica Records, but only for Canadian distribution; the release on Indica was withheld until an international distributor was found.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} {{section of the}} fort, similar actions were taking place, as the airborne troops raced to destroy or otherwise disable the fortifications housing artillery pieces. Objective No. 13 was a casemate housing multiple machine-guns whose arcs of fire covered {{the western side of}} the Fort; to destroy the casemate, the airborne troops used a flamethrower to force the Belgian soldiers manning the weapons to retreat, and then detonated shaped charges against the fortification to disable it. Another observation cupola fitted with machine-guns, Objective No. 19, was destroyed, but two further objectives, Nos. 15 and 16 were found to be dummy installations. Unexpected complications came from Objective No. 23, a retractable cupola housing two 75mm artillery pieces. It had been assumed that the weapons in this fortification could not stop the airborne assault, but this assumption was found to be false when the weapons opened fire, forcing the airborne troops in the area to go to cover. The rapid fire of the weapons led to air support being summoned, and a Stuka squadron bombed the cupola. Although the bombs did not destroy the cupola, the explosions did force the Belgians to retract it {{throughout the rest of the}} fighting. Any exterior entrances and exits located by the airborne troops were destroyed with explosives to seal the garrison inside the Fort, giving the garrison few opportunities to attempt a counter-attack. The airborne troops had achieved their initial objective of destroying or disabling the artillery pieces that the fort could <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> bombard the captured bridges, but they still faced a number of small cupolas and emplacements that had to be disabled. A number of these included anti-aircraft weapons and machine-guns.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor lands the TARDIS in Cardiff, {{using the}} energy of the Cardiff Rift to {{recharge}} the engines. Rose has Mickey bring her passport to the TARDIS, and together with the Doctor and Jack Harkness, they go to lunch. At lunch, the Doctor spots a newspaper article showing Margaret Blaine, a Slitheen, has become Cardiff's new mayor. The four track down and capture Margaret to find out what she is doing there after their previous encounter (in Aliens of London). The Doctor observes Blaine's scale model plans for a new nuclear power plant, but identifies that it is purposely flawed to cause a meltdown that would open the Cardiff Rift and destroy the Earth. He also discovers the model contains a functioning tribophysical waveform macro-kinetic extrapolator that Margaret would <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> flee the Earth. The Doctor decides to take Margaret back to her home planet of Raxacoricofallapatorious, but she reveals that she has received a death sentence there and will be executed upon returning. The Doctor agrees to her final request to accompany her to a dinner meal. Margaret makes several half-hearted attempts to kill the Doctor but he easily avoids them. She then tries to play on the Doctor's sympathies, asking him to take her to another planet instead.|$|E

25|$|Prehistoric {{technology}} is technology that predates recorded history. History {{is the study}} of the past using written records. Anything prior to the first written accounts of history is prehistoric, including earlier technologies.

During a four-week period of silence, individuals undergo a series of directed meditations on the purpose of life and contemplations on the life of Christ. They meet regularly with a spiritual director who guides their choice of exercises and helps them to develop a more discerning love for Christ.|$|E

According to Thomas, all references that {{were made to the}} music of the peoples of Middle-earth in the books were used to extrapolate as much information as possible about the instruments and styles that each race would <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> create their music. This information was then used as the base for creating the score. Additionally, 61 songs from the game were made available for free in mp3 format using a download manager released by Turbine.|$|E
25|$|The {{body of the}} Wests' former {{friend and}} housemate, Terrence Crick, was found in his car in the Scarborough {{district}} of Hackness in January 1996. He was 48 years old. Crick had become acquainted with Fred while he had resided at the Lake House Caravan Park in 1969; he had reported Fred to the authorities on several occasions after having been shown both surgical instruments Fred claimed to <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> perform illegal abortions, and Polaroid images of the subjects' genitals {{he claimed to have}} taken immediately after the procedures, before suggesting Crick assist him in recruiting pregnant girls to perform upon. Crick had believed the information he had provided to police was ignored as Fred was a known police informant. The stress and guilt Crick had felt over the fact the information he had provided had not resulted in charges being brought apparently led him to take his own life; an inquest later recorded a verdict of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. His widow later submitted a formal complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.|$|E

25|$|Politeness is {{one measure}} that {{researchers}} <b>have</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> study human-computer interaction. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks {{a question about}} themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if {{it may be a}} dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise. The computer would provide them with a fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions – a pencil and paper evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that participants who were asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, & Carney, 1999.|$|E
