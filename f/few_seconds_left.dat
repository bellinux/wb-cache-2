25|$|Cleveland {{lost to the}} Giants for {{the second}} time in the sixth game of the season at the Polo Grounds in New York. The Giants again managed to stymie the Browns' passing game, but {{employed}} a different strategy from the one they used in three weeks before. Instead of dropping their defensive ends into coverage to handle Cleveland's receivers, New York allowed single coverage on the receivers and had its ends rush Graham, giving him less time to find his men open. Graham lost 71 yards being tackled while dropping back to pass. A fumble by Graham early in the game was recovered by the Giants, leading to New York's first score, a 22-yard field goal. The Browns scored a field goal midway through the second quarter after going for it on fourth down at midfield and getting help from an interference penalty. Tony Adamle recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff, and the Browns drove into New York territory as time ran out in the first half. Groza kicked a field goal, putting the Browns ahead 6–3. After Cleveland kicked off to New York with only a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> in the half, returner Jim Ostendarp let the ball roll to his own one-yard line and the Browns recovered the live ball. Graham then ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. The Giants dominated in the second half, scoring a touchdown on their second drive and adding another in the fourth quarter to win the game, 17–13. Graham was held to just 118 yards of passing on 10 completions. Cleveland defensive end Len Ford suffered a severe injury to his face during the game and had to be taken to the hospital. He sat out the remainder of the regular season and had to have his mouth wired shut so it could heal.|$|E
500|$|Oklahoma State's passing {{attack was}} more active, with both Zac Robinson and Bobby Reid {{completing}} 8passes (on 17attempts for 149yards for Robinson, 12 and 82 for Reid). However, {{they were still}} only able to connect for one touchdown (Reid to D'Jaun Woods in the fourth quarter) and Robinson missed high on a last-second [...] "Hail Mary" [...] that would have tied the game (the PAT would have put the Cowboys up by one with only a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> in the game). The Cowboys were also able to produce 119yards and two touchdowns on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|This game {{marked the}} 12th time the Gamecocks have {{traveled}} to Gainesville {{where they were}} winless on the road (0-11) coming into the game. [...] The last time the two teams met in Gainesville, the Gamecocks nearly earned their first victory against the Gators in the Swamp, but fell short with a field goal attempt blocked by Jarvis Moss with only a <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> in the game. [...] History was also made in this game with it being the first college football game where a Heisman-winning coach (Steve Spurrier) coached against a Heisman-winning player (Tim Tebow).

40|$|Looks at {{television}} that cross content boundaries (both between and within programming) {{provide an opportunity}} to examine the causes of attentional inertia—that looks at television become very much more stable after the first <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> Previous research <b>left</b> unresolved whether this inertia is due to expectations or biologic processes (strategic vs. nonstrategic processes), and this study allows direct comparisons. The strength of the inertial relationship varied considerably for different kinds of program boundaries, and also for within-program boundaries, with the latter varying as well by the genre in which they were contained. Taken together, the results provided no evidence for nonstrategic, biological processes causing attentional inertia. Instead, sev-eral genre-specific explanations based on expectations and cognitive demands are proposed. The study of visual attention to television has centered on what causes atten-tion and what attention signals about underlying cognitive processes. Debate over the first has been structured primarily around an active/reactive dichot-omy: whether the viewer or the stimulus primarily controls attention (se...|$|R

2500|$|In {{his debut}} with San Diego in the September 19 season opener (Week 2), Harbaugh threw {{two touchdowns in}} 15-for-27 passing over 159 yards in a 34–7 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. However, San Diego lost the next game to Harbaugh's former team Indianapolis Colts 27–19, as Harbaugh {{completed}} 15 of 37 passes for 188 yards. With very <b>few</b> <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> and on the Colts' 24, Harbaugh threw an interception to Tyrone Poole. [...] Harbaugh started the Week 4 (October 3) game against the Kansas City Chiefs completing 6 of 9 passes for 38 yards and an interception before leaving due to a bruised right elbow; [...] he missed the Week 5 (October 10) and Week 6 (October 17) games because of that injury and two broken ribs. Harbaugh returned in Week 7 (October 24) in a 31–3 loss to the Green Bay Packers as backup to starter Erik Kramer; both quarterbacks threw 3 interceptions each. Harbaugh next started a game on Week 9 (November 7) and completed 25 of 39 passes for 235 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 2 interceptions and rushed 14 yards in 2 carries in a 33–17 loss to defending champion Denver Broncos. The Chargers lost its sixth game in a row after a 4–1 start in Week 12 (November 28) to the Minnesota Vikings 35–27. Robert Griffith intercepted a Harbaugh pass at the Vikings' 1-yard line with 4:29 left, and Minnesota ran out the clock to seal the win.|$|E
6000|$|In a {{few minutes}} those Eskimos who were best paddlers crept ahead of the rest. Grabantak and his son took the lead, whether because of right or because of {{superior}} strength {{it was hard to}} say. Anders, who was a powerful fellow, and an expert canoeman, kept close alongside of them.

Exasperated by this, Gunrig put on what we in these times call a [...] "spurt," [...] and went ahead at a pace which, in a <b>few</b> <b>seconds,</b> <b>left</b> most of the runners a good way behind. This was received by the spectators with a cheer, in which surprise was fully as prominent as satisfaction, for although {{they knew that the}} chief was celebrated for his speed of foot, few of them had actually seen him run before that day, and it at once became evident that if his endurance was equal to his speed, it would go hard with his competitors.|$|E

50|$|The {{co-pilot}} later acknowledged this message. It was {{the last}} communication with the ATC. As the landing gear retracted, the pitch angle of the two propellers simultaneously reached a value that {{is lower than the}} minimum values for flight. This setting caused the aircraft's speed and altitude to decrease rapidly. <b>Few</b> <b>seconds</b> later, the <b>left</b> engine and the right engine stopped, and the flight data recorders ceased functioning. The first impact marks are found on the south edge of the road RN1. They represent the two main landing gears and the fuselage tail cone. The left wing tip scratched across the road before hitting an embankment at {{the north side of the}} road RN1. Both wheels and blades came off from the aircraft. The aircraft bounced. At this point, the empennage and part of the right wing broke away, the aft portion of the fuselage turned around to the right and the aircraft came to rest 25 meters further away. At 09:05:42 (local tine),the aircraft disappeared from the radar screen. It was immediately found that the aircraft had crashed in a field seven hundred meters to the north of runway centreline.|$|R

Since she dated Michael when she worked in Scranton before and A. J. when she moved to Nashua, she feels like {{she does not want}} to fall into her pattern of dating co-workers again. Michael and Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) then go out on a sales call. After landing the sale, an irritable Michael needs to stop to use the bathroom. While at a gas station, Jim gets a call from Pam Halpert's (Jenna Fischer) mother Helene (Linda Purl), who was taking a feverish CeCe to see the doctor when she accidentally locked the child in the car. Panicked, Jim attempts in vain to tell Michael through the door of the bathroom, then tells another gas station customer to tell Michael what happened and drives off, but the customer leaves after only waiting for a <b>few</b> <b>seconds.</b> Michael is <b>left</b> with no way of contacting the office, as his cell phone and wallet are with Jim and he does not remember the office's number, so he ends up wandering around Scranton and making stops at a pet store and a hot dog stand.|$|R

Arizona was able to cut the lead to 45-35 on a 63-yard touchdown pass from Scott to Austin Hill soon after the 4th quarter began. Nevada then took a 48-35 lead on a 25-yard field goal from Hardison, for a 13-point lead with only 1:44 left in regulation time. Arizona, with no timeouts and needing two scores to win the game, was able to cut the lead down to 48-42 with only 42 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> in regulation on a short touchdown pass from Scott to Hill. After Marquis Flowers successfully recovered the onside kick, Arizona quickly scored with another short Scott touchdown pass, this time to Tyler Slavin, to take tie the game at 48 with only 19 <b>seconds</b> <b>left</b> in regulation. Prior to the extra point attempt, Nevada coach Chris Ault called his final timeout to try to ice kicker John Bonano. The tactic was unsuccessful, as Bonano made the extra point to give Arizona a one-point lead. The final 19 seconds of the game were {{the only time that}} Arizona led.
