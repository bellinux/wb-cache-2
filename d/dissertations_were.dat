25|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 20th century, {{research}} began with Willibald Nagel's study of Graupner's sinfonias. In the 1920s, Friedrich Noack published his research on Graupner's cantatas. Baerenreiter published several sinfonias and an ouverture in the 1950s. In the early 1980s, Myron Rosenblum edited four sinfonias for the massive Barry Brook project The Symphony, 1720-1840: A Comprehensive Collection of Full Scores (New York: Garland, 1979–85), 60 vols. The year 1988 saw the publication of Oswald Bill's study of Graupner, with several articles by such Graupner experts as Peter Cahn (on the sinfonias), Joanna Cobb Biermann (musicians and salaries in Darmstadt), as well as source documents on court life in Darmstadt. Three <b>dissertations</b> <b>were</b> very important for Graupner research: H. Cutler Fall's study of the Passiontide cantatas, Rene Schmidt's study of the Christmas cantatas, and Vernon Wicker's study of solo bass cantatas. Christoph Grosspietsch published an extensive study of Graupner's ouvertures in 1994.|$|E

6000|$|Some {{time during}} the month of December, 1817, Byron wrote out a fair copy of the entire canto, {{numbering}} 184 stanzas (MS. D.); and on January 7, 1818, Hobhouse left Venice for England, with the [...] "whole of the MSS.," [...] viz. Beppo (begun October, 1817), and the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold, together with a work of his own, a volume of essays on Italian literature, the antiquities of Rome, etc., which he had put together during his residence in Venice (July--December, 1817), and proposed to publish as an appendix to Childe Harold. In his preface to Historical Illustrations, etc., 1818, Hobhouse explains that on his return to England he considered that this [...] "appendix to the Canto would be swelled to a disproportioned bulk," [...] and that, under this impression, he determined to divide his material into two parts. The result was that [...] "such only of the notes as were more immediately connected with the text" [...] were printed as [...] "Historical Notes to Canto the Fourth," [...] and that his longer <b>dissertations</b> <b>were</b> published in a separate volume, under his own name, as Historical Illustrations to the Fourth Canto of Childe Harold. To these [...] "Historical Notes" [...] an interest attaches apart from any consideration of their own worth and importance; but to understand the relation between the poem and the notes, it is necessary to retrace the movements of the poet and his annotator.|$|E
