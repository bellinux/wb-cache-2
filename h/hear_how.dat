5|$|Job Maarse, artistic {{director}} of Pentatone, said of the album's origins: From day one the co-operation between Pentatone and the Oregon Symphony and its Music Director Carlos Kalmar has been something magical. The quality of the orchestra and the program ideas of Carlos Kalmar {{attracted the attention of}} a large group of music lovers in and outside the U.S. During a pleasant meeting at the Chicago airport almost two years ago the idea for this new album was discussed. I believe all at the table liked it and now everybody can <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> these three pieces, although by composers with different styles, fit perfectly in one program. And of course the Copland symphony {{is one of the best}} pieces ever written by an American composer.|$|E

And I've spent the last 10 years with {{everyone}} expecting to <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> I spend the money, which I will not do.|$|E

25|$|At first, {{his return}} to Venice was a cordial one {{and he was a}} celebrity. Even the Inquisitors wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> he had escaped from their prison. Of his three {{bachelor}} patrons, however, only Dandolo was still alive and Casanova was invited back to live with him. He received a small stipend from Dandolo and hoped to live from his writings, but that was not enough. He reluctantly became a spy again for Venice, paid by piece work, reporting on religion, morals, and commerce, most of it based on gossip and rumor he picked up from social contacts. He was disappointed. No financial opportunities of interest came about and few doors opened for him in society as in the past.|$|E
500|$|McCartney {{summarised}} {{the importance}} of Epstein when he was interviewed in 1997 for a BBC documentary about Epstein, saying, [...] "If anyone was the Fifth Beatle, it was Brian". In his 1970 Rolling Stone interview, Lennon commented that Epstein's death {{marked the beginning of}} the end for the group: [...] "I knew that we were in trouble then... I thought, 'We've had it now'". Thirty years after Epstein's death, McCartney said, [...] "Brian would really be happy to <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> much we loved him". The first contract between the Beatles and Epstein was auctioned in London in 2008, fetching £240,000.|$|E
500|$|Branson also later thanked local {{residents}} {{for their help}} at the accident site, describing how he [...] "was very impressed to <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> those kind people rallied round, opening their hearts and opening their doors to strangers in distress". Local farmers assisted the emergency services by transporting equipment using quad bikes and four-wheel drive vehicles. Sergeant Jo Fawcett of the Cumbria Constabulary also offered thanks, saying that [...] "There {{are so many people}} who have given up their own time to contribute in some way to dealing with the aftermath of the derailment that it would be unfair to name them for fear of missing someone out." ...|$|E

500|$|A career-high 23 goals led Suter's 81-point {{campaign}} in 1992–93, but he again struggled {{with a pair}} of knee injuries that caused him to miss three months of the 1993–94 season and limited him to 25 games for the Flames. His tenure with Calgary ended on March 10, 1994, when the team included him in a six-player trade. [...] The Flames sent Suter, along with Paul Ranheim and Ted Drury, to the Hartford Whalers in exchange for James Patrick, Zarley Zalapski and Michael Nylander. The move surprised Suter: [...] "Calgary's meant a great deal to me. You always <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> trades are part of the game and that you don't have any control over them. When it happens, it's a shock. It just blows me away." ...|$|E
500|$|Darwin's book The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs on {{his theory}} of atoll {{formation}} was published in May 1842 after {{more than three years}} of work, and he then wrote his first [...] "pencil sketch" [...] of {{his theory of}} natural selection. To escape the pressures of London, the family moved to rural Down House in September. On 11 January 1844, Darwin mentioned his theorising to the botanist Joseph Dalton Hooker, writing with melodramatic humour [...] "it is like confessing a murder". Hooker replied [...] "There may in my opinion have been a series of productions on different spots, & also a gradual change of species. I shall be delighted to <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> you think that this change may have taken place, as no presently conceived opinions satisfy me on the subject." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Material Girl" [...] {{consists}} of synth arrangements, {{with a strong}} backbeat supporting it. A robotic male voice repeats the hook [...] "Living in a material world". According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, the song {{is set in the}} time signature of common time, with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It is set in the key of C major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the tonal nodes of C4 to C5. The song has a basic chord progression of F–G–Em–Am-F-G-C in the chorus, while the verses are based on the C mixolydian mode, giving a hip, swing-like mood. The bassline in the song with the post-disco origins is reminiscent of The Jacksons' [...] "Can You Feel It", which appeared on their 1980 album Triumph. Furthermore, the strophes remind of the refrain from Melissa Manchester's hit [...] "You Should <b>Hear</b> <b>How</b> She Talks About You" [...] (1982).|$|E

500|$|... "One More Chance" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 92 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of F major, with a basic sequence of Cmaj7–Bm7–Am7–Bm7 as its chord progression, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to B4. The verses start off with F major and then the chorus leans towards D minor, the bridge and the ending sections changes to D major. Louis Virtel from Idolator said on the song [...] " [...] begs for forgiveness, and her only accompaniment is stark acoustic strumming." [...] Madonna utilized her vocal lessons for Evita during the recording of [...] "You'll See" [...] and [...] "One More Chance". She said [...] "If you listen to those songs, you can <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> I was trying to absorb and utilize what I was learning for the recording of Evita." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian Alex von Tunzelmann {{gave the}} film a mixed review in The Guardian: [...] "The Girl {{is perhaps a}} more {{effective}} piece of film-making than Hitchcock, though it is also more questionable in its portrayal of the directorhe film depicts [...] accurately, though Jones's Hitchcock {{appears to be more}} gratified by the spectacle than the real Hitch was". Simon quotes Donald Spoto's book The Dark Side of Genius (1983), in which Hedren told Spoto [...] " [...] was terribly upset by all this"; screenwriter Evan Hunter said, [...] "e wanted to shoot it, but something in him didn't want to shoot it, and everybody could <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> nervous he was". Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film should not be viewed in terms of truths or untruths, but instead as [...] "an exquisitely lurid morality play in the Hitchcock style", calling The Girl [...] "an original masterpiece that pays tribute to Hitchcock's talent and vision".|$|E
500|$|Lucy Jones of The Daily Telegraph {{said that}} [...] "with catchy choruses, soulful key changes and cute hooks laid bare, these are undeniably {{brilliant}} pop songs." [...] Jones further commented that [...] "finger clicks, bongos and mellow guitars are {{a welcome change}} from the squealing synths and pounding beats favoured by Bieber and his peers," [...] and that the album {{had the ability to}} connect with audiences beyond his demographic. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "B-" [...] rating, stating [...] that the album doesn't change Bieber's beloved [...] "kiddie-soul vocals" [...] calling it [...] "perfunctory", but said that acoustic renditions such as [...] "Baby", [...] "One Time" [...] and new song [...] "Pray" [...] deliver their [...] "saccharine payload." [...] Thomas Conneron of Chicago Sun-Times said that [...] "calming down several of the pop tunes with slower tempos and patient singing" [...] was not bad and that slowing everything down made listeners <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> the singer's voice had matured.|$|E

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} recording, Gabriel became [...] "obsessed" [...] {{with the}} album's track listing and created an audio {{cassette}} of all the song's beginnings and ends in order to <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> the sounds blended together. His original intention was to have [...] "In Your Eyes" [...] {{at the end of}} the record, but because of its prominent bass line, it had to be placed earlier in the listing on the vinyl edition as there is more room for the stylus to vibrate. With later CD releases, this restriction was removed and the track was placed {{at the end of the}} album. So was completed in February 1986 and cost £200,000 to make. It was over-dubbed at Power Station Studios in New York, despite Gabriel considering sending it via a computer-telephone set up, reasoning, [...] "that's a lot of information to send via phone. Isn't it amazing though? You can send a song idea around the world to musicians then beam parts back by satellite". It was mastered by Ian Cooper in mid-February 1986 at London's Townhouse Studios.|$|E
500|$|Murphy and Mark Brydon {{ended their}} romantic {{relationship}} but were still contractually obligated to record another album, which became Moloko's 2003 album Statues. When she finished touring, {{she found herself}} alone and had to re-evaluate the friendships she had built. During this time, she got to know Matthew Herbert, whom she had met when he remixed several of Moloko's songs. Murphy had {{wanted to work with}} him again, commenting that [...] "it felt very natural…because Matthew makes things seem quicker and easier". During the first day of recording with Herbert, he had her bring an unspecified object so that they could hit it against a microphone and record the sound it made. Herbert's approach was that for Murphy to go solo, the album should revolve around her and the sounds that surround her. They wanted to carry out recording and audio mixing in one room, so Herbert invested in a studio. There, Herbert recorded Murphy's voice without accompaniment so that she could better <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> her voice naturally sounded. On occasion, the two added instruments to a track by having her hire an instrumentalist, sometimes to play an unusual instrument such as a hammered dulcimer.|$|E
500|$|By 1966, the Beatles {{had grown}} weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could [...] "send out four waxworks... {{and that would}} satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are {{nothing to do with}} music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites." [...] In June that year, two days after {{finishing}} the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: [...] "Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "You'll See" [...] is an {{acoustic}} pop ballad. It {{is set in}} the time signature of common time, having a tempo of 120 beats per minute. The song is played in the key of G Major, with a basic sequence of Em–D–Em as its chord progression during the first verse, while piano and guitar are used to play the background music. The sequence shifts to Em–C–D–G–C–F during the chorus. Madonna's voice spans from G3 to C5. Throughout the chord changes progression to give Madonna's vocals dominance in the song, and after a minute the percussion starts with a tremolo guitar added later. String synths and drums build the track further with the second verse seeing the singer harmonizing with herself. During the recording of the track, the singer used her vocal lessons for Evita; she said [...] "If you listen to those songs, you can <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> I was trying to absorb and utilize what I was learning for the recording [...]" [...] Lyrically the song talks of independence after the end of a love affair stating that Madonna will go onto greater things. When asked if the track was about revenge, the singer replied: [...] "No, it's about empowering yourself", but also adding that [...] "there's another side too which is—'Don't fuck with me, I don't need anybody. I can do what I want'".|$|E
500|$|Strong {{explained}} in Desperate Housewives: Behind Closed Doors {{that she believed}} {{there to be a}} [...] "conceptual shift" [...] after the filming of the original pilot with Lee, and [...] "they realized they needed something different", stating: [...] "There certainly wasn't something wrong with what [...] did. It was just that instead of vanilla they wanted chocolate, and I happened to be chocolate. When I walked in to audition, Marc Cherry was so sweet. He said, 'I hope you don't mind, but I'm going to close my eyes, because I really want to <b>hear</b> <b>how</b> you sound.' When I was done with the audition, {{he opened his eyes and}} this angelic smile crept across his face, and I thought, 'Oh, good. Something went right.'" [...] The actress also explained that she watched the pilot filmed with Lee and while that was helpful for her own portrayal, she saw that what she had to offer for the role was different, saying: [...] "It's a little strange when you watch someone else in a role you're auditioning for because his or her performance lives in your mind. It can be hard to distinguish yourself sometimes, but I had fun with it." [...] Scenes featuring Lee were refilmed with Strong as her replacement. Strong stated years later that her role and narration as Mary Alice led to her voice becoming significantly recognizable, explaining in a 2012 interview with Entertainment Weekly that fans of the series would recognize her in coffee shops solely by her voice. The actress served as the narrator of almost every episode of the series, with the exceptions of the third season episode [...] "My Husband, the Pig" [...] (in which Steven Culp narrates the episode as the deceased Rex Van de Kamp) and the fifth season episode [...] "Look Into Their Eyes and You See What They Know" [...] (in which Nicollette Sheridan narrates the episode as the deceased Edie Britt).|$|E
