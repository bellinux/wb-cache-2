40|$|Abstract. A {{shaft of}} {{electric}} motor <b>fin-fan</b> <b>cooler</b> failed {{after two years}} operation. The inspection revealed that the v-belt attached on the electric motor loosed before the failure occurred. Visual investigation results showed the brittle fracture with less plastic deformation. Multiple crack origins observed {{on the edge of}} the shaft indicates that the more than one stress concentration generated within the shaft. Microstructure observation revealed fine grain on the edge and become coarse into the center of the shaft. The hardness test results were in good agreement to the microstructure observation where the edge are is harder than the center. Fractography using SEM revealed inclusions located within the shaft and some inclusions are clustered on the area where the cracks initiate to propagate. The presence of intermetallic inclusions was identified by microanalysis using EDS. Inclusions that are brittle in nature become stress concentrations for the operating load since its properties is close to ceramic. The presence of fine grain and inclusions {{on the edge of the}} shaft become detrimental to the shaft properties and the presence of fine grain aggravate the failure for its effect according to Hall-Petch theory...|$|E
