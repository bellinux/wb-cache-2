40|$|The low thermal {{efficiency}} and low water production {{are among the}} major challenges that prevent membrane distillation (MD) process from being commercialized. In an effort to design an efficient multi-stage direct contact MD (DCMD) unit through mathematical simulation, a new phenomenon that we refer to as total water production capacity inversion (WPI) has been detected. It is represented by {{a decrease in the}} total water production beyond a number of stages or a certain module length. WPI phenomenon, which was confirmed by using two different mathematical models validated experimentally, was found to take place due to the decrease in water vapor flux across the membrane as well as the increase in heat loss by conduction as the membrane length increases. Therefore, WPI should be considered as a critical MD design-criterion, especially for large scale units. Investigations conducted for a simulated multi-stage DCMD process showed that <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> and permeate temperatures difference, feed and permeate flow rates, and feed salinity have different effects on WPI. The number of stages (or module length at constant width) that leads to a maximum water production has been determined for different operating parameters. Decreasing <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> and permeate temperatures difference, or <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> and permeate flow rates and increasing <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> temperature at constant temperature difference or <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> salinity cause the WPI to take place at lower number of stages. Even though the feed salinity affects negligibly the mean permeate flux, it was clearly shown that it can affect WPI.

Flow maldistribution in the microchannels was analyzed considering the combined effects of the two-phase flow characteristics (flow pattern, gas quality, mass fluxes and superficial velocities), microchannel-header arrangements (horizontal or vertical), and microchannel flow and header feeding orientations (horizontal, vertical upward or vertical downward). The header was loaded with two-phase mass fluxes of 72, 144 and 216 kg/m(2) s and the gas quality ranged from 0 to 0. 75. An increase in the flow rate homogeneity was noted for the arrangement horizontal header and horizontal microchannels, when the header was loaded parallel to the microchannels or perpendicularly from the header bottom. Highly heterogenous flow distributions occurred for the arrangement vertical header and horizontal microchannels. Preferential liquid feeding occurred in the microchannels far from the <b>inlet</b> <b>feeding</b> tube for <b>inlet</b> flows with high gas quality (over 10 %) and high gas superficial velocity (over 20 m/s) and with the inlet tube parallel to the microchannels.

The period seems to be connected to the geometry of the screw and independent on the feed screw velocity which was varied with the roll speed with a constant ratio.

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} in membrane distillation (MD) desalination is scaling, mainly CaSO 4 and CaCO 3. In this study, {{in order to achieve}} a better understanding and establish a strategy for controlling scaling, a detailed investigation on the MD scaling was performed by using various analytical methods, especially an in-situ monitoring technique using an optical coherence tomography (OCT) to observe the cross-sectional view on the membrane surface during operation. Different concentrations of CaSO 4, CaCO 3, as well as NaCl were tested separately and in different mixed feed solutions. Results showed that when CaSO 4 alone was employed in the feed solution, the mean permeate flux (MPF) has significantly dropped at lower volume concentration factor (VCF) compared to other feed solutions and this critical point was observed to be influenced by the solubility changes of CaSO 4 resulting from the various <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> temperatures. Although the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> and permeate flow rates could contribute to the initial MPF value, the VCF, which showed a sharp MPF decline, was not affected.

On the other hand, NaCl + CaSO 4 mixed feed solution resulted in a linear MPF decline as VCF increases and delayed the critical point to higher VCF values. In addition, CaCO 3 alone in feed solution did not affect the scaling, however, when CaSO 4 was added to CaCO 3, the initial MPF decline and VCF met the critical point earlier.

40|$|Abstract This Ph. D thesis {{focuses on}} the {{synthesis}} of menthol-loaded-Poly-ε-caprolactone nanoparticles (NP's) for transdermal application. Polymers are increasingly needed to produce nanoparticles ready to convey drugs to the tissues or cells of interest. Polymer nanoparticles are submicron-sized colloidal systems. Without doubt, the adequacy of these systems relies upon {{the structure of the}} vehicle and, specifically, on the mean size and on the particle size distribution (PSD). The poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) polymer is chosen to synthesize nanoparticles because of its adaptability and fine tunning of its physico-chemical properties (great biocompatibility and biodegradability) which can be changed to acquire the desired nanoparticle size. Nanospheres have a monolithic type of structure (network) in which drugs are dispersed or absorbed on the surfaces or in the particles. Nano-capsules are vesicular systems in which the drug is kept in a cavity comprising of an inner liquid encompassed by a polymeric layer, which gives a supporting structure to the encapsulated material. For this state the active principle is normally dissolved in the inner core, yet may likewise be absorbed to the capsule surface. Nanosphere or nanocapsule development basically relies upon the production process. Nanoparticles utilized as drug delivery systems ought to be made out of biodegradable, biocompatible and nontoxic polymers. A number of distinctive strategies can be used to integrate polymer nanoparticles. Each has their own particular points of interest and constraints, which normally include blending of two fluid streams, e. g. emulsification-evaporation, emulsification-diffusion and solvent displacement. The solvent displacement strategy is characterized by simplicity of reproducibility, the possibility to utilize solvents with low poisonous potential and above all controlled particle size distribution (PSD). The nano-precipitation system involves dissolving the drug and polymer in the same solvent and afterward blending them with an antisolvent (typically water) in which the drug is immiscible and the nanoparticles are spontaneously framed. In this study, the nanoparticles were produced by utilizing three intensive reactors: a confined impinging jet mixer (CIJM), a two-inlet vortex mixer (VM) and a four-inlet vortex mixer (MIVM), testing their performance in the same operating conditions. Dynamic light scattering was carried out to measure the mean nanoparticle size (dp), particle size distribution (PSD), zeta potential (Z-average) and Polydispersity index (PDI). Nanoparticle separation was carried out by a centrifugation process for Transmission Electron microscope (TEM) analysis and menthol loading evaluation. Menthol quantification was evaluated by Gas chromatography (GC). Differential scanning calorimetry and transmission and scanning electron microscopy techniques were considered for analysing the particle surface morphology and menthol and identification in the nanoparticles and melatonin suspension over textile fabrics. Exceptional micro scale reactors are extremely helpful to get an efficient blend of the considerable number of components present in the solvent solution. High super-saturation can be produced by distinctive micromixers, for example, the Confined Impinging Jets Mixer (CIJM) and the Multi Inlet Vortex Mixer (MIVM), in less time than the required time for nucleation and growth procedures of the precipitating solutes. Super saturation brings the unconstrained development of nanoparticles within the nano estimate limits. The nanoparticles were prepared using the aforementioned intensive mixers (CIJM and MIVM), PCL polymer and diverse internal cores (menthol, melatonin, miglyol etc). The main goal was to investigate the effect of these working parameters on the mean size of the nanoparticles, a reasonable design of Experiment (DoE) was utilized. Furthermore, the effect of the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> speed Vj (Flow rate FR), mass proportion and quench volumetric proportion QR (dilution) on the mean size dp, the zeta potential Zp and poly dispersity index (PDI) of the nanoparticles was also explored. At first poly-ε-caprolactone nanoparticles (nanospheres) were produced under different working conditions. The essential goal of this evaluation was to prepare the nanoparticle synthesis with a wide size range of menthol-loaded -PCL. A further aim to advance the synthesis parameters. After early promising results it was evident that further examinations were required keeping in mind the final goal to optimize the mean size of the nanoparticles. Likewise, quantification of nanoparticles was completed with the specific end goal of estimating drug loaded and encapsulation efficiency. Quantification procedure included various stages followed by centrifugation, extraction and gas chromatography analysis. All nanoparticles studied in this proposition were produced by the solvent displacement technique, utilizing three reactors CIJM, MIVM- 4 and VM- 2. All trials were performed with a PCL of monolithic-type molecular weight (Mw) 14000 g/mol. Two unique solvents were utilized for the production of the nanoparticles; acetone and acetonitrile. Since these solvents satisfy the following criteria: adequate dissolvability of PCL, water miscibility and low harmfulness. The impact of solvents on the delivered nanoparticles utilizing acetone and acetonitrile was seen: with higher estimations of the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> rate, the nanoparticles became distinctly smaller. In addition, preliminary trials using a third solvent tehtrahydroforan were also done for the sake of comparsion. The impact of the working conditions on the mean size of nanoparticles was explored the underlying polymer concentration, the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> rate and the impacts of the post preparing conditions, for example, the quench (dilution). It was found that the initial polymer concentration, and in addition the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> velocity, has {{a significant impact on the}} mean size of nanoparticles. With higher feeding concentrations of PCL polymer, nanoparticles became distinctly greater. When feed velocity was expanded the mean size of nanoparticles diminished. It was also observed that NP size was higher for acetonitrile in contrast with acetone solvent at comparable working conditions in all cases. Moreover, dilution of the solution containing nanoparticles (higher the quench) was found indispensible to obtain stable nanoparticles. In addition, by expanding the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> rate, smaller nanoparticles with lower zeta potential, were acquired. Smaller nanoparticles were created in the MIVM regarding the CIJM. Polydispersity index (PDI, 0. 05 ± 0. 3) and zeta potential (- 30 mV to - 40 mV) were observed in all investigated experiments. After nanoparticles were produced, they were quantified. An exact and appropriate measurement of menthol was acquired by a Gas chromatography (GC). Results showed that the incorporation efficiency of menthol in the nanoparticles with expanding menthol content was very nearly 60 % - 80 % in both the CIJM and VM mixers, and this indicates that menthol was adequately exemplified by PCL polymer upon precipitation. Loading was assessed at 35 % - 50 % around, with expanding mass proportion of menthol and PCL, when utilizing both reactors. These results were confirmed through morphologic perceptions of nanoparticles utilizing transmission electronic microscope (TEM) examination. From there on, the work was centered around the synthesis of PCL nanocapsules containing differing internal cores (miglyol, and melatonin). Melatonin nanocapsules were further utilized for the impregnation of cotton fabrics. Furthermore, the synthesis and characterization of the nanocapsules formed by PCL (surface layer) and by melatonin or miglyol (in the core) was investigated. To optimize the nanocapsules production process, the impact of different working conditions was explored i. e. the underlying polymer concentration, the underlying, melatonin or miglyol concentrations and the <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> rate, on their mean sizes. Comparative conclusions, were observed for menthol loaded nanoparticles, that is when expanding <b>inlet</b> <b>feed</b> rate the mean size of nanocapsules diminished. Finally, it was also found that when concentrations of all substances was increased larger nanocapsules were shaped...|$|E

All that remains {{are a number}} of {{foundations}} surrounded by scraps of lumber and metal, 3 cemeteries, including one where almost every person buried died on the same date in an avalanche on the gold rush trail, and the ruins of the wharf. Visitors can usually spot brown bears, black bears, caribou, and eagles. Brown bears tend to use the Dyea <b>inlets</b> to <b>feed</b> during salmon spawning season (July-August).|$|R
40|$|Most {{boosting}} {{systems in}} internal combustion engines utilize `pulse turbocharging' {{to maximize the}} energy extraction by the turbine. An internal combustion engine with more than four cylinders has a significant overlap between the exhaust pulses which, unless isolated, can decrease the overall pulse energy and increase the engine pumping loss. Thus, it is advantageous to isolate a set of cylinders and introduce the exhaust gases into two or more turbine entries separately. There are two main types of multiple entry turbines depending on the method of flow division: the twin-entry and the double-entry turbine. In the twin-entry design, each <b>inlet</b> <b>feeds</b> the entire circumference of the rotor leading edge regardless of inlet conditions. In contrast, the double-entry design introduces the flow from each gas inlet into the rotor leading edge through two distinct sectors of the nozzle. This paper compares {{the performance of a}} twin and double-entry mixed flow turbine. The turbines were tested at Imperial College for a range of steady-state flow conditions under equal and unequal admission conditions. The performance of the turbines was then evaluated and compared to one another. Based on experimental data, a method to calculate the mass flow under unequal admission from the full admission maps was also developed and validated against the test result...|$|R
