5|$|Despite this, many post-grunge bands {{adopted a}} <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> sound {{and in the}} 2000s there came a renewed {{interest}} in established bands, attempts at a revival, and new <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> bands that emerged from the garage rock and post-punk revival scenes. Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys. In the 2000s, only a few <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> bands from the 1970s and 1980s managed to sustain highly successful recording careers.|$|E

5|$|The opening {{years of}} the 1980s saw a number of changes in {{personnel}} and direction of established <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> acts, including the deaths of Bon Scott, the lead singer of AC/DC, and John Bonham, drummer with Led Zeppelin. Whereas Zeppelin broke up almost immediately afterwards, AC/DC pressed on, recording the album Back in Black (1980) with their new lead singer, Brian Johnson. It became the fifth-highest-selling album of all time in the US and the second-highest-selling album in the world. Black Sabbath had split with original singer Ozzy Osbourne in 1979 and replaced him with Ronnie James Dio, formerly of Rainbow, giving the band a new sound and a period of creativity and popularity beginning with Heaven and Hell (1980). Osbourne embarked on a solo career with Blizzard of Ozz (1980), featuring American guitarist Randy Rhoads. Some bands, such as Queen, moved away from their <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> roots and more towards pop rock, while others, including Rush with Moving Pictures (1981), began {{to return to a}} <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> sound. The creation of thrash metal, which mixed heavy metal with elements of hardcore punk from about 1982, particularly by Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth and Slayer, helped to create extreme metal and further remove the style from <b>hard</b> <b>rock,</b> although a number of these bands or their members would continue to record some songs closer to a <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> sound. Kiss moved away from their <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> roots toward pop metal: firstly removing their makeup in 1983 for their Lick It Up album, and then adopting the visual and sound of glam metal for their 1984 release, Animalize, both of which marked a return to commercial success.

5|$|Bon Jovi's third album, Slippery When Wet (1986), mixed <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> with a pop {{sensitivity}} {{and spent a}} total of 8 weeks {{at the top of}} the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 12 million copies in the US while becoming the first <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> album to spawn three top 10 singles — two of which reached number one. The album has been credited with widening the audiences for the genre, particularly by appealing to women as well as the traditional male dominated audience, and opening the door to MTV and commercial success for other bands at the end of the decade. The anthemic The Final Countdown (1986) by Swedish group Europe was an international hit, reaching number eight on the US charts while hitting the top 10 in nine other countries. This era also saw more glam-infused American <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> bands come to the forefront, with both Poison and Cinderella releasing their multi-platinum début albums in 1986. Van Halen released 5150 (1986), their first album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals, which was number one in the US for three weeks and sold over 6 million copies. By the second half of the decade, <b>hard</b> <b>rock</b> had become the most reliable form of commercial popular music in the United States.|$|E

It was during this time that Peart decided to revamp his playing style by incorporating jazz and swing components. Gruber was also responsible for introducing him to the products of Drum Workshop, the company whose products Peart currently endorses.|$|E

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{recently}} proposed Coiled Tube Turbodrilling technology for drilling deep <b>hard</b> <b>rocks</b> mineral exploration. Coiled Tube (CT) is a continuous length of ductile steel or composite tube that itself cannot rotate {{and therefore a}} down hole motor is needed to provide mechanical power to the bit. Amongst the down hole motors, turbodrills (turbine down hole motors) are an excellent fit with CT operations for <b>hard</b> <b>rocks,</b> providing a smooth borehole with little vibrational effects during drilling with high output rotational speed. The turbine motor section has multistage of rotors and stators which convert the hydraulic power to mechanical power. This paper presents a methodology for designing turbodrills with asymmetric rotor or stator blades configurations. Here, the turbodrill is designed specifically for small size CT system providing suitable output power and rotation speed with applicable input flow properties. Also, {{the results of a}} few numerical simulations carried out using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code are presented. The results help in choosing the best turbine motor configurations to obtain optimum rotational speed and torque during drilling <b>hard</b> <b>rocks</b> for small hole size exploration applications. Similar methodology can be used to design and choose the best turbodrill for other <b>hard</b> <b>rocks</b> drilling conditions...|$|R
