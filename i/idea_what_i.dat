Then, {{in front of the}} camera she was explosive, like a great model, but with her own unique style. She came over the next day to see some prints and the proofs, and there was shot after shot to choose from. We agreed on every choice and whittled it down to the album cover images. I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had just been a party to." ...|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{was seen}} by ABC executives, in her Broadway {{performance}} of Spamalot, which garnered their attention. Due to their admiration, the network offered Ramirez a role on any ABC television series, of her choice, and she chose Grey's Anatomy. Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", explaining that it is rare. Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "I {{was looking for a}} girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was looking for." [...] Rhimes built the character around Ramirez after she met her. Ramirez's character was initially given recurring status in the second season and received star billing in the third season, alongside fellow cast member Dane, who portrayed Mark Sloan. Ramirez discusses maintaining relationships with co-stars: ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Burton {{first saw}} Stephen Sondheim's 1979 stage musical, , as a CalArts student in London in 1980. Burton {{recalled}} his experience {{of seeing the}} show, saying, [...] "I was still a student, I didn't know if I would be making movies or working in a restaurant, I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> would be doing. I just wandered into the theatre and it just blew me away because I'd never really seen anything that had the mixture of all those elements. I actually went three {{nights in a row}} because I loved it so much." [...] Although not a fan of the musical genre, Burton was struck by how cinematic the musical was, and repeatedly attended subsequent performances. He described it as a silent film with music, and was [...] "dazzled both by the music and its sense of the macabre." [...] When his directing career took off in the late 1980s, Burton approached Sondheim with a view to making a cinematic adaptation, but nothing came of it. In Sondheim's words, [...] " [...] went off and did other things." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You," [...] said Dr. Yavitch, [...] "are a middle-road liberal, and you haven't the {{slightest}} <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> you want. <b>I,</b> being a revolutionist, know exactly <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want--and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want {{now is a}} drink." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{said the}} countess, piteously, [...] "you {{can have no}} <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> shall {{have to go through}} with your father. And, of course, you could get all these things afterwards." ...|$|R
500|$|In 2008, Blair {{expressed}} {{frustration that}} Carmella {{had become a}} [...] "very tortured, depressive character {{and there was no}} {{light at the end of}} the tunnel." [...] She described the role, which went through enormous transformations, as being one that had pushed her acting abilities. Blair's pleas to the show producers to let the down-on-luck Carmella be up-beat again were rejected. In June 2008, the actress confirmed her plans to leave the series when her contract expired. Speaking of her decision to leave, Blair said: [...] "I made the decision in December [...] I am eager to try new things and go to a place where people have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have done, I want to experiment with what works for me and what doesn't as a performer." [...] Producers confirmed they did not intend to kill her character off, as they hoped for her to return again in the future. A spokesperson for the programme's broadcaster, Network Ten, stated: [...] "Obviously, we've loved having Natalie on the show all these years and we're really sad to see her go [...] and hope to see her on Ramsay Street again one day in the future." [...] Blair later admitted she was surprised at her rise popularity whilst playing Carmella.|$|E
500|$|Following {{her success}} on Broadway, Ramirez joined {{the cast of}} Grey's Anatomy in a {{recurring}} role as Dr. Calliope 'Callie' Torres, a love interest for Dr. George O'Malley, in the show's second season. On a special Grey's Anatomy-themed episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show, she revealed that top executives from ABC, who were greatly impressed by her performance in Spamalot, offered her a role in any ABC show she wanted. She picked Grey's, as she was already {{a fan of the}} show. [...] Ramirez further explained that at her initial audition, the producers liked her, and had intentions to add her to the show, but did not know who to cast her as. She also said she was in awe of how the executives said, [...] "Pick a show, any show", explaining that it is rare. The series creator and executive producer, Shonda Rhimes explained: [...] "I was looking for a girlfriend for George, but it was in the infancy stages, so I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was looking for."

Ramirez, who was initially given a recurring status {{at the time of the}} character's inception, received a star billing in the show's third season, alongside fellow cast member Eric Dane, who portrayed Dr. Mark Sloan.|$|E
2500|$|On April 11, 1974, Coleman lost {{a bid for}} {{a no-hitter}} {{in the eighth inning}} when Gene Michael of the New York Yankees hit a one-out single. [...] By May 15, 1974, Coleman had a 6–1 record and {{appeared}} to be on track for the best season of his career. [...] However, he did not win another game for two months, and his performance dropped off markedly. [...] He finished the 1974 season with a 14–12 record and a 4.32 ERA in 41 starts. He walked an astounding 158 batters in 1974 (a Tigers single-season record) for a career high rate of 5.0/9 IP. [...] At the end of the 1974 season, Coleman said: [...] "It was really strange. [...] My arm felt better than it ever had before in my life. But I couldn't do it. [...] It {{was just one of those}} crazy things. At times I didn't have any <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was doing out there." ...|$|E
30|$|Rather than {{start with}} the divisions, I have {{preferred}} to begin with an account that foregrounds the unifying <b>ideas,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call <b>ideas</b> of Europe. This is also because these ideas are present and make possible progressive counter-trends that contain within them the seeds of future possibilities. Moreover, to speak of crisis requires a perspective on critique, since {{it makes no sense}} to speak of something being in crisis if it is not clear what it is that is in crisis. It is a well-stablished position in German social theory that crisis and critique are connected.|$|R

2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, and one day I decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
6000|$|And I have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have said, and I have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{ought to}} have said, and I am a total ass, but my heart is in the right place, and I am, my dear Henry James, yours, ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I shall {{look better}} tomorrow, Dick, when I get these outlandish things off. I {{have been trying}} on my new suit, and I think it will do, first rate.

6000|$|... "Well, Ruth, {{at present}} {{it is only}} known to Mr. Vickery, Mr. Volkes, and myself, and, {{whatever}} happens, I want you to say nothing about it until I give you leave.

6000|$|... "Oh! you've no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> {{awful things}} <b>I</b> have heard since I {{went to live}} with the Jew, who is very kind to me, Paulina. They {{said they were going to}} kill the Dey." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Horribly!" [...] he answered, {{gazing at}} her in amazement--"horribly! It was dreadful. Are you ill? You {{have no idea what}} it was. You have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> suffered." ...|$|E
6000|$|For a {{time she}} sat on a rail before leaving the road for the downland turf. [...] "But I wish," [...] she said, [...] "I had some <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was really up to." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot, I cannot," [...] cried Marianne; [...] "leave me, leave me, if I {{distress}} you; leave me, hate me, forget me! {{but do not}} torture me so.

6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been simple, my dear"--and he {{continued}} to smile--"if it had been, {{one way or the}} other, only a question of 'wanting.' It took, I admit it, the <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had best do, all sorts of difficult and portentous forms. It came up for me really--well, not at all for my happiness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why do {{you come}} around here trying to bully this boy? He had no <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{was going to do}} until he saw me work, while you {{understood}} the whole plan.

6000|$|... "Fay, don't be distressed," [...] he said. [...] "I won't do {{anything}} right away. You can trust me. I won't be rash. I'll consult you before I make a move.

6000|$|... "That {{sounds so}} like you," [...] he said. [...] "I came up last night, suddenly. I {{have no idea}} how long I am going to stay; I have no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am going to do. As for the spirit in which I have come--well, I should call it an inquiring one." ...|$|E
6000|$|Of course Howells {{promptly}} {{replied that}} he would read the story, [...] adding: [...] "You've no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> may {{ask you to do}} for me, some day.

60|$|Of my {{making a}} speech in the same dreamy fashion, without having an <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want to say, beyond such as may be comprehended in the full {{conviction}} that I haven't said it. Of our being very sociably and simply happy (always in a dream though); and of Jip's having wedding cake, and its not agreeing with him afterwards.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't {{talk about}} my innuendoes and my ideas--you might {{remember}} those in which I have heard you indulge! <b>Ideas?</b> <b>what</b> <b>ideas</b> did <b>I</b> ever have before I came here?' Laura Wing asked, with a trembling voice. 'Don't pretend to be shocked, Selina; that's too cheap a defence. You have said things to me--if you choose to talk of freedom! What is the talk of your house and what does one hear if one lives with you? <b>I</b> don't care <b>what</b> <b>I</b> hear now (it's all odious and there's little choice and my sweet sensibility has gone God knows where!) and I'm very glad if you understand that <b>I</b> don't care <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say. If one talks about your affairs, my dear, one mustn't be too particular!' the girl continued, with a flash of passion.|$|R
6000|$|... "True; but I {{have been}} tossed {{to and fro}} in doubt if I ought, after such strong provocation. To see me now, Thomasin, gives you no <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have been; of <b>what</b> depths <b>I</b> have descended to in these few last days. O, it was a bitter shame to shut out my mother like that! Can I ever forget it, or even agree to see her again?" ...|$|R
60|$|Naturally I {{was much}} {{handicapped}} {{by the presence}} of the girl. But I could not abandon her, though I had no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should do with her after rejoining my companions. That she would prove a burden and an embarrassment I was certain, but she had made it equally plain to me that she would never return to her people to mate with Buckingham.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{said that}} 'Rosie M. Banks' was your pen-name, and you didn't want it {{generally}} known, {{because you were}} a modest, retiring sort of chap. He'll listen to you now. Absolutely hang on your words. A brightish <b>idea,</b> <b>what?</b> <b>I</b> doubt if Jeeves in person could have thought up a better one than that. Well, pitch it strong, old lad, and keep steadily before you the fact that I must have my allowance raised. I can't possibly marry on what I've got now. If this film is to end with the slow fade-out on the embrace, at least double is indicated. Well, that's that. Cheerio!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then a fresh {{apprehension}} assailed me. Suppose Bellairs {{had given}} me the slip? Suppose he was now rolling {{on the road to}} Stallbridge-le-Carthew? or perhaps there already and laying before a very white-laced auditor his threats and propositions? A hasty person might have instantly pursued. Whatever I am, I am not hasty, and I was aware of three grave objections. In the first place, I could not be certain that Bellairs was gone. In the second, I had no taste whatever for a long drive at that hour of the night and in so merciless a rain. In the third, I had no idea how I was to get admitted if I went, and no <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should say if I got admitted. [...] "In short," [...] I concluded, [...] "the whole situation is the merest farce. You have thrust yourself in where you had no business and have no power. You would be quite as useful in San Francisco; far happier in Paris; and being (by the wrath of God) at Stallbridge-Minster, the wisest thing is to go quietly to bed." [...] On the way to my room I saw (in a flash) that which I ought to have done long ago, and which it was now too late to think of--written to Carthew, I mean, detailing the facts and describing Bellairs, letting him defend himself if he were able, and giving him time to flee if he were not. It was the last blow to my self-respect; and I flung myself into my bed with contumely.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are {{completely}} mistaken, and I have {{not the least}} <b>idea</b> <b>what</b> you mean. <b>I</b> don't know <b>what</b> {{you are trying to}} fasten on me, and I have never had less need of any one's explanations in my life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Neil Pennycook {{noted that}} [...] "song [...] "Flittin’ {{gave me an}} <b>idea</b> of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted the album to be about. While {{the other two are}} pretty heavily-themed, I just wanted this album to reflect what was {{happening}} {{over the course of a}} year. I don’t think the lyrics are quite as metaphorical as they’ve been in the past, they’re a bit more direct and that’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was after. That carried through the instruments as well." ...|$|R
5000|$|A Taste of Honey, first {{performed}} on 27 May 1958, {{is set in}} her native Salford. [...] "I had strong <b>ideas</b> about <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wanted {{to see in the}} theatre.
