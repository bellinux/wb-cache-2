5|$|M-64 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the highway. These traffic counts are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This number <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of the traffic that uses a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT's surveys showed that the highest AADT along M-64 was 3,333vehicles daily on the Ontonagon River Bridge; the lowest traffic was between US2 and the Gogebic–Ontonagon county line at 418vehicles per day. The only segments of the trunkline that have been included on the National Highway System (NHS) are the US2 and M-28 concurrencies. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E
5|$|The Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) {{measures}} the traffic volumes on its highways using a calculation called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This value <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> {{of the number}} of vehicles that use a section of roadway on any average day of the year. When the department surveyed M-247 in 2009, the southernmost section near M-13 carried 6,135vehicles; the remainder carried 6,224vehicles. As a subset of these figures, 190commercial vehicles used the trunkline on average. This was an overall increase from 2008 when the sections carried 5,031and 5,573vehicles respectively, but a decrease from the 214commercial vehicles.|$|E

Objectivism <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of capitalist idealism within a naturalistic framework. Most proponents of metaphysical naturalism in First World countries, however, are neither Marxists nor Objectivists, and instead embrace the more moderate political ideals of secular humanism or cultural moral relativism.|$|E

25|$|A {{polynomial}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> {{that is the}} sum of {{a finite}} number of non-zero terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of variables raised to whole number powers. For example, x2 + 2x − 3 is a polynomial in the single variable x. A polynomial expression <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> that may be rewritten as a polynomial, by using commutativity, associativity and distributivity of addition and multiplication. For example, (x − 1)(x + 3) is a polynomial expression, that, properly speaking, is not a polynomial. A polynomial function is a function that is defined by a polynomial, or, equivalently, by a polynomial expression. The two preceding examples define the same polynomial function.|$|E
