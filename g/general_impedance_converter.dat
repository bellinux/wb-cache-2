The fractional inductors {{used in this}} work have been realized {{with the help of}} <b>general</b> <b>impedance</b> <b>converter</b> circuit and fractional capacitors. Impedance characterization of fractional inductors with different exponents has been carried out experimentally. Also a generalized approach to design a fractional-order bandpass filter is discussed in this work. The fractional-order bandpass filter consists of a series combination of a resistor, a fractional inductor of order 1 << 2, and a fractional capacitor of order 0 << 1. The performance of fractional-order bandpass filters has been studied and compared with corresponding integer-order filters through both experimentation and simulation.

50|$|The {{negative}} <b>impedance</b> <b>converter</b> (NIC) is a one-port op-amp circuit {{acting as}} a negative load which injects energy into circuits in contrast to an ordinary load that consumes energy from them. This is achieved by adding or subtracting excessive varying voltage in series to the voltage drop across an equivalent positive impedance. This reverses the voltage polarity or the current direction of the port and introduces a phase shift of 180° (inversion) between the voltage and the current for any signal generator. The two versions obtained are accordingly a negative <b>impedance</b> <b>converter</b> with voltage inversion (VNIC) and a negative <b>impedance</b> <b>converter</b> with current inversion (INIC).
