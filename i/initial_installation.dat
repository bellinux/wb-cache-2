5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays. The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing. Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a few months before the <b>initial</b> <b>installation</b> at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.|$|E
25|$|A {{properly}} {{designed and}} installed extensive green-roof system can cost $108–248/m2 ($10–23/ft2) while an intensive green roof costs $355–2368/m2 ($33–220/ft2) however, {{since most of}} the materials used to build the green roof can be salvaged it is estimated that the cost of replacing a green roof is generally one third of the <b>initial</b> <b>installation</b> costs.|$|E

After 87 years {{at the end of}} the company's natural gas storage {{development}} project, the installation of any goods supplied to 84% is reached. Electric power supply operation by the end of the project has not improved in 86 years at the end of year 87 5/96% is reached. The gas injection project design, installation and commissioning of gas injection compressors 87 till about 3/9% has been developed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{first two}} lines, totaling [...] of track miles, got CBTC from 2000–2017. The two lines with the <b>initial</b> <b>installations</b> of CBTC were both chosen because their {{respective}} tracks are relatively {{isolated from the}} rest of the subway system, and they have fewer junctions along the route.|$|R
25|$|On {{the evening}} of July 31, 2001, despite some <b>initial</b> <b>installation</b> {{difficulties}} and concerns regarding structural support for the monument's weight, Moore had the completed monument transported to the state judicial building and installed in the central rotunda. The installation was filmed, and videotapes of the event were sold by Coral Ridge Ministries, an evangelical media outlet in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, which later used proceeds from the sales of the film to underwrite Moore's ensuing legal expenses. Coral Ridge was {{the operation of the}} late Reverend D. James Kennedy, a staunch Moore supporter.|$|E
25|$|Originally {{designed}} by Mardas, of Apple Electronics, the <b>initial</b> <b>installation</b> {{proved to be}} unworkable − with almost no standard studio features such as a patch bay, or a talkback system between the studio and the control room, let alone Alex's promised innovations − {{and had to be}} scrapped. Nevertheless, the Beatles recorded and filmed portions of their album Let It Be in the Apple Studio, with equipment borrowed from EMI; during takes they had to shut down the building's central heating, also located in the basement, because the lack of soundproofing allowed the heating system to be heard in the studio.|$|E
2500|$|Steel: Case hardened, {{stress-relieved}} steel preformed shapes {{are available}} {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations. [...] Balls, balls with flat spots, ovoids (footballs), diagonally cut wire similar to angle-cut cylinders, ball cones and cones (both of which are different from the general concept of cones) and pins are the most commonly used. [...] Steel media weigh approximately 300 pounds per cubic foot and are expensive for <b>initial</b> <b>installation,</b> but, because of their minimal attrition rate and extreme cleanliness, are being more widely used for light deburring applications and cleaning. [...] Compounds are available to keep steel burnishing media clean and bright for extended periods.|$|E
50|$|Electrification of the {{railways}} gained {{momentum in the}} early fifties. Although <b>initial</b> <b>installations</b> were with 3 kV DC traction, {{the railways}} subsequently adopted the 25 kV AC system. Electrification of the Bardhaman-Mughalsarai section was completed in 1957 and the Howrah-Gaya stretch was electrified by around 1960. The Tatanagar-Adra-Asansol section was electrified in the 1957-1962 period.|$|R

2500|$|As before-and-after studies become {{broader and}} more sophisticated, {{it appears the}} {{reduction}} estimates for both CSRS and CRS are less impressive. [...] This {{may be due to}} the <b>initial</b> <b>installations</b> were on highways that had been identified as having very high accident rates due to inattention. [...] Also, there may have been other accident reduction campaigns in concert with rumble strip programs." ...|$|R
2500|$|Although the <b>initial</b> <b>installation</b> {{would remain}} in operation, the {{additional}} antenna spokes and alternator installations would not be completed, due to a major discovery about radio signal propagation. While investigating transmitter [...] "harmonics" [...] – unwanted additional radio signals produced at higher frequencies than a station's normal transmission frequency – Westinghouse's Frank Conrad unexpectedly found {{that in some cases}} the harmonics could be heard farther than the primary signal, something previously thought impossible, as high-frequency shortwave signals, which had poor groundwave coverage, were thought to have a very limited transmission range. In 1924, Conrad demonstrated to Sarnoff that a low-powered shortwave station in East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania could be readily received in London by a simple receiver using a curtain rod as an antenna, matching, at {{a small fraction of the}} cost, the performance of the massive alternator transmitters. In 1926 Dr. Harold H. Beverage further reported that a shortwave signal, transmitted on a 15-meter wavelength (approximately 20MHz), was received in South America more readily during the daytime than the 200 kilowatt alternator transmissions.|$|E
2500|$|The new capitol {{building}} was first {{occupied by the}} Alabama Legislature on October 1, 1851. [...] The clock over the portico was installed in February 1852. The clock, along with a bell, was purchased by the City of Montgomery and presented to the state in 1852. [...] In proportion to the {{capitol building}}, the clock appears as a square white box with black dials and crowned with a gabled roof. The dials are [...] in diameter with [...] minute hands and a [...] hour hands. [...] It has been criticized as architecturally inappropriate on various occasions since its <b>initial</b> <b>installation.</b> [...] With the secession of Alabama and six other Deep South states and subsequent formation of the Confederacy in February 1861, the building served as its first capitol until May 22, 1861. A commemorative brass marker {{in the shape of}} a six-pointed star is set into the marble floor of the front portico at the precise location where Jefferson Davis stood on February 18, 1861, to take his oath of office as the only President of the Confederate States of America.|$|E
2500|$|Some street trams (streetcars) used conduit third-rail current collection. The {{third rail}} was below street level. The tram {{picked up the}} current through a plough (U.S. [...] "plow") {{accessed}} through a narrow slot in the road. In the United States, much (though not all) of the former streetcar system in Washington, D.C. (discontinued in 1962) was operated in this manner to avoid the unsightly wires and poles associated with electric traction. The same was true with Manhattan's former streetcar system. The evidence of this mode of running can still {{be seen on the}} track down the slope on the northern access to the abandoned Kingsway Tramway Subway in central London, United Kingdom, where the slot between the running rails is clearly visible, and on P and Q Streets west of Wisconsin Avenue in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington DC, where the abandoned tracks have not been paved over. The slot can easily be confused with the similar looking slot for cable trams/cars (in some cases, the conduit slot was originally a cable slot). The disadvantage of conduit collection included much higher <b>initial</b> <b>installation</b> costs, higher maintenance costs, and problems with leaves and snow getting in the slot. For this reason, in Washington, D.C. cars on some lines converted to overhead wire on leaving the city center, a worker in a [...] "plough pit" [...] disconnecting the plough while another raised the trolley pole (hitherto hooked down to the roof) to the overhead wire. In New York City for the same reasons of cost and operating efficiency outside of Manhattan overhead wire was used. A similar system of changeover from conduit to overhead wire was also used on the London tramways, notably on the southern side; a typical changeover point was at Norwood, where the conduit snaked sideways from between the running rails, to provide a park for detached shoes or ploughs.|$|E
50|$|The in-theater effects {{packages}} {{were sometimes}} produced by different manufacturers. Busch Entertainment Corporation (BEC) developed its own package for its <b>initial</b> <b>installations,</b> as did Thorpe Park. Later installations most likely utilized a more common package {{which was the}} early Iwerks 3D/4D FX Theatre System. Thorpe Park's package was developed by Technology Design Associates (TDA), and integrated by Advanced Entertainment Technology (AET).|$|R

25|$|One of {{the most}} notable actions of the Bf 110 {{occurred}} {{on the night of}} the 17/18 August 1943. Bf 110 units had been mass equipped with the Schräge Musik system, an emplacement of two upward-firing cannon, which for its <b>initial</b> <b>installations</b> placed the twin-cannon fitment almost midway down the cockpit canopy behind the pilot, which could attack the blind spot of RAF Bomber Command's Lancaster and Halifax bombers, which lacked a ventral turret. Using this, NJG 5's Leutnant Peter Erhardt destroyed four bombers in 30 minutes.|$|R

5000|$|From the {{technical}} standpoint [...] "Altai" [...] was fairly ordinary UHF/VHF trunked radio, {{but it was}} equipped with the automatic switching circuits on both mobile and static nodes that allowed the mobile end of the link to generate and transmit dialing signals and to connect the static end to the PSTN. Few <b>initial</b> <b>installations</b> used 150 MHz frequency, but as the network grew the later iterations switched to 330 MHz. Base stations have had up to 22 independent trunks of 8 channels each, and were commonly mounted together with the TV transmitters, sometimes even sharing the HF circuitry. This allowed for good coverage, as there were generally only one base station per city.|$|R
