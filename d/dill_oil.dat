40|$|The {{indiscriminate}} {{use of pesticides}} in the control of agricultural and public health pests {{has led to the}} development of insecticide resistance in many insect pest species, posing a large threat to the continued success of chemical control measures. Resistance towards pesticides can be due to a number of mechanisms, but enhanced detoxification of the insecticide by metabolic enzymes, such as esterases, glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) or monooxygenases, plays a large role in insecticide resistance. Synergists, such as piperonyl butoxide (PBO) can be used to overcome metabolic insecticide resistance. Synergists are capable of inhibiting enzymes involved in insecticide resistance, thus restoring a level of susceptibility. By virtue of its enzyme inhibitory qualities, PBO is often used to enhance the efficacy of pyrethrum (an organic insecticide). In some countries, however, PBO is no longer certified for organic use and this study explored the use of natural plant oils or extracts as potential organically-certifiable pyrethrum synergists. From a commercial viewpoint, an effective natural synergist could potentially allow development of new pyrethrum formulations into higher value niche markets, such as organic agriculture. Synergised pyrethrum could also offer a new control option against insects resistant to synthetic pesticides in mainstream agriculture. The efficacy of various natural plant oils and extracts as pyrethrum synergists were examined for synergistic potential towards pyrethrum with several agriculturally significant insect pest species, Helicoverpa armigera, Frankliniella occidentalis, Myzus persicae, Meligethes aeneus and Musca domestica, a serious public health pest, using discriminating dose bioassays. PBO proved to be the most effective pyrethrum synergist in all species tested, however, a number of natural plant oils also showed efficacy. The most promising compounds were <b>dill</b> apiole <b>oil</b> and parsley seed oil, synergising pyrethrum in all the species tested. <b>Dill</b> apiole <b>oil</b> and parsley seed oil contain the methylenedioxyphenol ring structure that is characteristic of PBO. Enzyme inhibition studies were used to examine the ability of the natural plant oils and extracts to inhibit the enzymes involved in metabolic insecticide resistance (esterases, GSTs and monooxygenases). In general, inhibition of esterases and GSTs was not correlated to synergism of pyrethrum in vivo. However, in H. armigera and M. persicae, with esterase mediated pyrethroid resistance, PBO, <b>dill</b> apiole <b>oil</b> and parsley seed oil inhibited non-specific esterases. In M. aeneus and M. domestica, where resistance to pyrethroids has been linked to monooxygenases, PBO, <b>dill</b> apiole <b>oil</b> and parsley seed oil showed significant inhibition of monooxygenases. However, not all compounds that inhibited esterases or monooxygenases synergised pyrethrum. The lack of correlation between enzyme inhibition and synergism could be due to a number of factors, including the ability of the synergist to penetrate the insect cuticle, speed of distribution of the synergist through the insect, metabolism of the compounds in the insect and affinity for the target site...|$|R
40|$|Sprout {{control is}} {{essential}} for successful management of stored potatoes. This study examined the effect of dill weed, spearmint and clove essential oils on sprouting of potatoes. Extracts of steam distilled dill weed whole plants containing 41. 5 - 42. 7 % of S-(+) -carvone and spearmint foliage extracts containing 97. 2 - 97. 6 % of R-(-) -carvone, were applied to tubers {{in a series of}} experiments using either 1 -L glass jars or 63 -L steel drums. The composition of the essential oils was consistent between years but evaporation rate varied among the <b>oils</b> as <b>dill</b> weed extract evaporated the fastest while clove oil evaporated the slowest under the same conditions. After exposure to essential oil treatments, tuber sprout number and weight were assessed and compared to untreated control and tubers treated with commercially marketed clove oil product (Biox-CTM, containing 78. 5 - 82. 3 % eugenol). Applications of 32. 5 and 47. 6 mg L- 1 headspace of <b>dill</b> weed <b>oil</b> and 21. 5 and 22. 3 mg L- 1 headspace of spearmint oil achieved 50 % reduction in 'Russet Burbank' sprout weight and sprout number respectively, 30 days after the initial treatment. Tubers stored in environments with 60 - 240 mg L- 1 headspace of dill weed or spearmint oils suppressed sprouting at least 5 weeks longer than that of the controls. In 63 -L steel drums, repeated <b>dill</b> and spearmint <b>oil</b> vapor treatments effectively and consistently suppressed sprouting of 'Russet Norkotah' and 'Piccolo' tubers for 7 - 8 months when doses were 25 mg L- 1 headspace or higher and when treatments were repeated at least every four weeks. Within this range, sprout suppression was not sensitive to treatment variations, and, therefore, an optimal treatment level could not be determined. Clove oil was less effective in suppressing sprouting, likely due to its slower vaporization compared to <b>dill</b> and spearmint <b>oils.</b> Essential oil treatment effects on seed tuber viability were evaluated on 'Piccolo'. Tubers were planted after exposure to <b>dill</b> or spearmint <b>oil</b> vapor environments ranging from 15 - 240 mg L- 1 headspace for seven days.

40|$|The {{essential}} oil {{extracted from the}} seeds of dill (Anethum graveolens L.) was demonstrated in this study as a potential source of an eco-friendly antifungal agent. To elucidate the mechanism of the antifungal action further, {{the effect of the}} {{essential oil}} on the plasma membrane and mitochondria of Aspergillus flavus was investigated. The lesion in the plasma membrane was detected through flow cytometry and further verified through the inhibition of ergosterol synthesis. The essential oil caused morphological changes in the cells of A. flavus and a reduction in the ergosterol quantity. Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), acidification of external medium, and mitochondrial ATPase and dehydrogenase activities were detected. The reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation was also examined through fluorometric assay. Exposure to <b>dill</b> <b>oil</b> resulted in an elevation of MMP, and in the suppression of the glucose-induced decrease in external pH at 4 µl/ml. Decreased ATPase and dehydrogenase activities in A. flavus cells were also observed in a dose-dependent manner. The above dysfunctions of the mitochondria caused ROS accumulation in A. flavus. A reduction in cell viability was prevented through the addition of L-cysteine, which indicates that ROS is an important mediator of the antifungal action of <b>dill</b> <b>oil.</b> In summary, the antifungal activity of <b>dill</b> <b>oil</b> results from its ability to disrupt the permeability barrier of the plasma membrane and from the mitochondrial dysfunction-induced ROS accumulation in A. flavus...|$|E
40|$|Essential oils (EOs) {{have been}} long {{recognized}} for their antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, insecticidal and antioxidant properties. The present research aimed {{to study the}} antimicrobial effects of some volatile oils from aromatic plants (sweet basil and dill) against several microorganisms, namely Bacillus subtilis, Alternaria alternata and Penicillium expansum.

40|$|Background & objectives: Pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{post-operative}} complications of cesarean section, which is very important for mother in nursing a baby and breastfeeding. Finding ways to overcome this pain has always been a concern for researchers. Considering the application of plants in traditional medicine as sedatives, this study evaluated the effect of <b>Dill</b> seed <b>oil</b> on post-operative pain in patients with spinal anesthesia. Methods: This double-blind, clinical trial was conducted on pregnant women who met the inclusion criteria and referred to Hajar hospital in Shahrekord, Iran during 2015 - 2016. By simple random sampling, the patients were divided into two groups. In the first group, 10 cc Dill (Anethum graveolens L.) seed oil was prescribed at intervals of half an hour and one hour before spinal anesthesia and half an hour, one hour and two hours after spinal anesthesia. In the second group, placebos (standard treatment) were prescribed at the same intervals. Pain and vital signs, including blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, heart rate, bleeding, use of narcotics and NSAID and any additional medications (such as atropine and ephedrine) were recorded and rechecked during surgery, thirty minutes after spinal anesthesia and one hour, four hours and twelve hours after cesarean section. Results: The findings showed a significant difference between the two groups in the third stage of the study (4 hours after cesarean section) only in respiratory rate and in the fourth stage of the study (12 hours after cesarean section) in all vital signs (p< 0. 05).
