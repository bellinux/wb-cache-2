Adsorption is greatest at a pH nearest the pKa of the carboxylic group of <b>imazaquin.</b> At higher pHs, the hydrogen bonds and charge-transfer complexes that form during adsorption interactions are much weaker at higher pHs.|$|E
50|$|A study {{conducted}} by Cornell University showed that <b>imazaquin</b> ingested by humans and animals was excreted within 48 hours, 94% through urine and 4% through feces. The LD50 for dogs, rats, rabbits, and female mice were each 1000 mg/kg, 5000 mg/kg, 2000 mg/kg, and 2363 mg/kg, respectively. Chronic toxicity studies were also conducted upon rabbits, rats, and beagle dogs. Chronic dermal exposure to <b>imazaquin</b> in rabbits during a 21 day time period yielded no effects upon the rabbits. A 90 day and one year study of ingestion of <b>imazaquin</b> in rats also yielded no effects as well. However, in the one year, dietary chronic <b>imazaquin</b> exposure to beagle dogs, the dogs exposed to the highest dose of <b>imazaquin</b> per day, 5000 ppm, experienced effects such as decreased body weight gain, skeletal myopathy, slight anemia, bone marrow hyperplasia, increased blood levels of SGOT, DSGPT and CPK, and increased liver weight. <b>Imazaquin</b> is also nontoxic to birds and fish when properly used. <b>Imazaquin</b> tested negative for mutagen effects, organ toxicity, and reproductive effects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Imazaquin</b> is a {{non-volatile}} chemical {{leading to}} limited movement into soil that eventually breaks down within 4-6 months. The chemical breaks down microbially and is slowly reduced to {{carbon dioxide and}} metabolites. When present in soil, <b>imazaquin</b> is absorbed through the roots of plants where the chemical is either metabolized quickly with no effects or slowly metabolized or not metabolized at all which eventually {{will lead to the}} death of the plant. As for its breakdown in surface water, <b>imazaquin</b> has a hydrolytic half-life of 5.5 months at pH 9. At pH 3 and 5, it is stable to hydrolysis.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Imazaquin</b> is {{primarily}} {{used as a}} herbicide to control weed growth on lawns and turf fields. Due {{to the fact that}} it is highly effective and selective, it is one of the most commonly used herbicides. [...] It is classified as an imidazolinone herbicide that controls weed growth through the inhibition of specific amino acids that prove to be vital for plant growth. <b>Imazaquin</b> inhibits the acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS) enzyme accountable for synthesis of the amino acids valine, leucine, and isoleucine. When applied, <b>imazaquin</b> halts weed growth which eventually kills the weed or causes the weed to die due to its incapability to compete with surrounding vegetation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Imazaquin</b> is a {{relatively}} nontoxic, non-carcinogenic chemical causing none to minimal eye and skin irritation if contacted upon the dermis, ingested orally, or inhaled. It has a toxicity classification of III, which corresponds to only a slight toxicity. It is {{a relatively}} low toxicity pesticide {{that has the potential}} to find its way into food, drinking water, and residential areas. Although exposure to residential areas affects infants and children, there is no concern over its presence due to its low estimated aggregated risk which meets the FQPA safety standards. Inhalation, dermal, and oral exposure to <b>imazaquin</b> yielded relatively low Margin of Exposure values issued by the EPA deeming <b>imazaquin</b> as a minimal risk concern.|$|E

50|$|<b>Imazaquin</b> has a water {{solubility}} of 60 mg/L and its half-life in soil is 60 days. It is therefore categorized as a moderately persistent pesticide.|$|E
50|$|Imidazolones (also called imidazolinones) are oxo {{derivatives}} of imidazoline (dihydroimidazoles). Examples include imidazol-4-one-5-propionic acid, {{a product}} of the catabolism of histidine, and <b>imazaquin,</b> a member of the imidazolinone class of herbicide.|$|E
50|$|The imidazolinone {{herbicides}} were first {{discovered in the}} 1970s. The first U.S. patent was awarded in 1980 for imazamethabenz-methyl. <b>Imazaquin,</b> imazapyr, imazapic, and imazethpyr followed suit and received patents in 1989.

50|$|The {{sorption}} coefficient is a {{means of}} specifying a pesticide's tendency to bind to soil particles. The greater the coefficient, the higher the sorption potential. A higher sorption coefficient means more hindrance of movement and possibly an increase in persistence as a result of protection from degradation. <b>Imazaquin</b> has a sorption coefficient of 20.|$|E
5000|$|Alachlor mixes {{well with}} other herbicides. It is marketed in mixed {{formulations}} with atrazine, glyphosate, trifluralin and <b>imazaquin.</b> It is a selective, systemic herbicide, absorbed by germinating shoots and by roots.

50|$|<b>Imazaquin</b> {{along with}} imazamethabenz-methyl, imazapyr, imazapic, imazethapyr, and {{imazamox}} all comprise the unique class of synthetic compounds termed the imidazolinone herbicides. The chemical structures of these chemicals all closely resemble one another, with the compounds containing an identical imidazolinone ring structure with a carboxylic acid group {{attached to the}} backbone. They vary only in the attached ring structure. These six herbicides kill plants by inhibiting acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS). AHAS is the first enzyme in the branched-chain amino acid pathway that eventually ends in the synthesis of amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine.|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{for the removal}} of agricultural pollutants, <b>imazaquin</b> and atrazine was conducted using montmorillonite (MMT) exchanged with organic cations through ion exchange. The study found that the adsorption of the herbicides was affected by the degree of organic cation saturations, the size of organic cations and the different natures of the herbicides. The modified clays intercalated with the larger surfactant molecules at the higher concentrations tended to enhance the adsorption of <b>imazaquin</b> and atrazine. In particular, the organoclays were highly efficient {{for the removal of}} <b>imazaquin</b> while the adsorption of atrazine was minimal due to the different hydrophobicities. Both <b>imazaquin</b> and atrazine were influenced by the changes of pH. The amphoteric <b>imazaquin</b> exists as an anion at the pH 5 – 7 and the anionic <b>imazaquin</b> was protonated to a neutral and further a cationic form when the pH is lower. The weak base, atrazine was also protonated at lower pH values. The anionic <b>imazaquin</b> had a strong affinity to the organoclays on the external surface {{as well as in the}} interlayer space of the MMT through electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. In this study, the electrostatic interaction can be the primary mechanism involved during the adsorption process. This study also investigated a comparative adsorption for the <b>imazaquin</b> and atrazine and the lower adsorption of atrazine was enhanced and this phenomenon was due to the synergetic effect.

40|$|<b>Imazaquin</b> is an {{herbicide}} {{widely used}} in Brazil to control weeds associated with the soybean crop. This work aimed to study the mobility and leaching of <b>imazaquin</b> in soils with different characteristics. In both experiments, a completely randomized block design was used; with tree replicates. We study the mobility of <b>imazaquin</b> in Red Eutrophic Latosol, clayey; Alfisol Haplic Eutrophic, medium texture; Alfissol Eutrophic, medium texture; and Orthic Psament, sandy texture. To obtain the mobility rate (Mr), a solution of 14 Cimazaquin with the activity of 304, 75 Bq/mL was applied to plates containing different soils. All Mr values range between 0. 803 and 1, indicating that <b>imazaquin</b> has a relevant mobility in our soils. In the leaching study, the soils were classified as Rhodic and differed chemically.

40|$|An {{analytical}} method for the determination <b>imazaquin</b> residues in soybeans was developed. The developed liquid/liquid partition and strong anion exchange solid-phase extraction procedures provide the effective cleanup, removing {{the greatest number}} of sample matrix interferences. By optimizing mobile-phase pH water/acetonitrile conditions with phosphoric acid, using a C- 18 reverse-phase chromatographic column and employing ultraviolet detection, excellent peak resolution was achieved. The combined cleanup and chromatographic method steps reported herein were sensitive and reliable for determining the <b>imazaquin</b> residues in soybean samples. This method is characterized by recovery > 88. 4 %, precision < 6. 7 % CV, and sensitivity of 0. 005 ppm, in agreement with directives for method validation in residue analysis. <b>Imazaquin</b> residues in soybeans were further confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).

40|$|Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) is {{the site}} of action of {{herbicides}} of different chemical classes, such as imidazolinones, sulfonylureas, and triazolopyrimidines. Inhibition of AHAS causes the accumulation of 2 -ketobutyrate (2 -KB) and 2 -aminobutyrate (2 -AB) (the transamination product of 2 -KB), and it has been proposed that the phytotoxicity of these inhibitors is due to this accumulation. Experiments were done to determine the relationship between accumulation of 2 -KB and 2 -AB and the phytotoxicity of <b>imazaquin</b> to maize (Zea mays). <b>Imazaquin</b> concentrations that inhibit growth of maize plants also cause the accumulation of 2 -KB and 2 -AB in the shoots. Supplementation of imazaquin-treated plants with isoleucine reduced the pools of 2 -KB and 2 -AB in the plant but did not protect plants from the growth inhibitory effects of <b>imazaquin.</b> Conversely, feeding 2 -AB to maize plants increased 2 -KB and 2 -AB pools to much higher levels than those observed in imazaquin-treated plants, yet such high pools of 2 -KB and 2 -AB in the plant had no significant effect on growth. These results conclusively demonstrate that growth inhibition following <b>imazaquin</b> treatment is not due to accumulation of 2 -KB and/or 2 -AB in plants. Changes in the amino acid profiles after treatment with <b>imazaquin</b> suggest that starvation for the branched-chain amino acids may be the primary cause of growth retardation of maize...|$|E

40|$|The abiotic {{degradation}} of the imidazolinone herbicides imazapyr, imazethapyr and <b>imazaquin</b> was investigated under controlled conditions. Hydrolysis, where it occurred, and photodegradation both followed first-order kinetics for all herbicides. There was no hydrolysis {{of any of the}} herbicides in buffer solutions at pH 3 or pH 7; however, slow hydrolysis occurred at pH 9. Estimated half-lives for the three herbicides in solution in the dark were 6. 5, 9. 2 and 9. 6 months for <b>imazaquin,</b> imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. Degradation of the herbicides in the light was considerably more rapid than in the dark with half lives for the three herbicides of 1. 8, 9. 8 and 9. 1 days for <b>imazaquin,</b> imazethapyr and imazapyr, respectively. The presence of humic acids in the solution reduced the rate of photodegradation for all three herbicides, with higher concentrations of humic acids generally having greater effect. Photodegradation of imazethapyr was the least sensitive to humic acids. The enantioselectivity of photodegradation was investigated using <b>imazaquin,</b> with photodegradation occurring at the same rate for both enantiomers. Abiotic degradation of imidazolinone herbicides on the soil surface only occurred in the presence of light.

40|$|Interactions of four {{aromatic}} nitrogen-heterocyclic herbicides (atrazine, <b>imazaquin,</b> metribuzin and paraquat) {{with the}} conductive polymer poly(o-ethoxyaniline) -POEA, were studied with {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), UV-visible spectrophotometry (UV-Vis) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. AFM profiles of self-assembled (SA) films of POEA revealed that the polymer surface became rougher (on the nanoscale) when exposed to atrazine, <b>imazaquin</b> and metribuzin, but slightly smoother in contact with paraquat. This suggested that specific chemical interactions, possibly electroscopic, have occurred between nitrogen atoms in the polymer chain and the dissimilar groups in the various herbicide molecules, during adsorption of the latter onto the film. The UV-Vis analyses indicated a stronger interaction of POEA in solution with <b>imazaquin,</b> that has a special importance for the intended application.

The presence of specific interactions increased the adhesion force (Fadh) between the AFM tip and the herbicides, which made the modified tip a powerful biosensor. Increases of approximately 132 % and 145 % in the Fadh values were observed when a tip functionalized with ALS was used to detect <b>imazaquin</b> and metsulfuron-methyl, respectively. The presence of specific interactions between the atrazine and the anti-atrazine antibody also caused {{an increase in the}} Fadh values (approximately 175 %) compared to those observed when using an unfunctionalized tip.

The three herbicides drastically inhibited all the rhizobium strains tested, showing a significant decrease of the CFU number {{as a function of}} herbicide rates. The rhizobium strains presented a differentiated tolerance to the herbicides. The herbicide rates that reduced 50 % (I 50) of the growth or survival of the rhizobium strains were below the recommended sprayed rates for weed control in the soybean crop, for all the three herbicides studied; however, sulfentrazone I 50 was smaller than <b>imazaquin</b> and clomazone I 50. As estirpes de Bradyrhizobium japonicum SEMIA 5073, SEMIA 5074, SEMIA 5079 e SEMIA 5080 foram cultivadas in vitro, utilizando meio de Vincent acrescido de diferentes doses dos herbicidas <b>imazaquin</b> (0; 0, 04; 0, 12; 0, 24; 0, 36 mg i. a. g- 1), clomazone (0; 0, 4; 0, 8; 1, 6; 3, 2 m i. a. g- 1) e sulfentrazone (0; 0, 2; 0, 4; 0, 8; 1, 6 mg i. a. g- 1), com o objetivo de avaliar a tolerância destas estirpes aos herbicidas. Os três herbicidas afetaram drasticamente as estirpes de rizóbio testadas, causando decréscimo significativo no crescimento ou na sobrevivência, em função do incremento nas doses. As estirpes de rizóbio apresentaram tolerância diferenciada aos herbicidas. As doses de herbicidas que reduziram em 50 % o crescimento ou a sobrevivência das estirpes (I 50) foram inferiores àquelas recomendadas para o controle de plantas daninhas na cultura de soja, para os três herbicidas estudados; no entanto, o I 50 do herbicida sulfentrazone foi significativamente menor que o I 50 dos herbicidas <b>imazaquin</b> e clomazone...|$|E

40|$|Extraction and {{quantification}} of {{herbicide residues}} from soil {{are important in}} understanding the behaviour of persistent herbicides. This research investigated extraction and clean-up methods for imidazolinone herbicides from soil and soil amended with organic material. A series of solvent mixes, pH conditions and sorbents was tested. Across three imidazolinone herbicides: imazapyr, imazethapyr and <b>imazaquin,</b> 0. 5 M NaOH extraction gave greater than 90 % recovery from soil samples; however, 0. 5 M NaOH:MeOH (80 : 20) resulted in higher recovery for <b>imazaquin,</b> {{but not for the}} other two herbicides. Of the sorbents tested, the use of chromatographic mode sequencing using C(18) and SCX sorbents provided consistent high (> 85 %) recovery of all three herbicides from soil and separation of the herbicides from other soil components by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). These two methods will allow high recovery of these imidazolinone herbicides from soil and have the ability to detect these herbicides without interference from other soil components.
