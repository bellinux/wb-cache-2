40|$|The structural/aerodynamic blade (SAB) {{analyzer}} {{provides an}} automated {{tool for the}} static-deflection analysis of turbomachinery blades with aerodynamic and rotational loads. A structural code calculates a <b>deflected</b> <b>blade</b> shape using aerodynamic loads input. An aerodynamic solver computes aerodynamic loads using <b>deflected</b> <b>blade</b> shape input. The two programs are iterated automatically until deflections converge. Currently, SAB version 1. 0 is interfaced with MSC/NASTRAN to perform the structural analysis and PROP 3 D to perform the aerodynamic analysis. This document serves {{as a guide for}} the operation of the SAB system with specific emphasis on its use at NASA Lewis Research Center (LeRC). This guide consists of six chapters: an introduction which gives a summary of SAB; SAB's methodology, component files, links, and interfaces; input/output file structure; setup and execution of the SAB files on the Cray computers; hints and tips to advise the user; and an example problem demonstrating the SAB process. In addition, four appendices are presented to define the different computer programs used within the SAB analyzer and describe the required input decks...|$|R

40|$|Free stream tidal {{turbines}} are rotating {{bodies in}} fast flowing tidal currents, {{and as such}} are exposed to fluctuating loads from the surrounding fluid.

He arranges a meeting with Manzi at a warehouse where he dispatches three more men and maims a fourth one, who leaves a blood trail that helps the police track down his location later on. Tom receives a shock when he finally finds Richie hanging in a harness after being horribly mutilated and tortured for twenty years. Manzi arrives and subdues Tom temporarily by hitting him with a baseball bat. He then hangs Tom by his wrists right next to Richie and prepares to torture him too. However, Tom thwarts Manzi by wrapping his legs tightly around his head, which causes Manzi to lose his balance and fall backward, bringing Tom down with him. Tom quickly grabs a gun and prepares to shoot Manzi but finds it is empty. Manzi gloats at this and then attacks Tom with a chainsaw, but Tom <b>deflects</b> the <b>blade</b> by holding tightly to his shackles before Manzi slips and falls onto the blade, which kills him. With Manzi now dead, Tom lowers Richie onto the floor and says he will get him to a hospital but Richie says he no longer wants to live in his helpless, undiginified state and begs Tom to help him die instead. Tom solemnly obliges by suffocating Richie in an act of euthanasia shortly before the police arrive. As Tom is being loaded onto an ambulance, he assures Edie that it is all over.|$|R
5000|$|On 1 July 1819 President Ibell {{received}} a visit {{at his home}} from a 28 year old pharmacist called Karl LÃ¶ning. [...] The visit was unusual both because the man arrived without any advance notice, and because he arrived before mid-day. LÃ¶ning's appearance was distracted and unconventional. Ibell nevertheless invited him in and they sat down to talk. Shortly after this LÃ¶ning produced a dagger and stabbed Ibell. Ibell was able to <b>deflect</b> the <b>blade,</b> so that while he ended up bleeding badly, he suffered no lasting physical damage. [...] A struggle ensued and after they {{ended up on the}} floor Ibell was able to hold LÃ¶ning still for long {{enough to be able to}} call for help.Eventually his wife heard his calls for help and attempted to disarm the attacker. After this failed she too called for help. Eventually more people arrived, including Ibell's fifteen-year-old son, and the men were able to remove LÃ¶ning. [...] It turned out that Karl LÃ¶ning was connected with the GieÃŸen Blacks, a radical republican student fraternity. The assassination attempt was one of a series of events which triggered the passing by the quasi-parliamentary Federal Assembly, in September 1819, of the Carlsbad Decrees, an essentially reactionary set of legislative measures which banned nationalist fraternities ("Burschenschaften"), removed liberal university professors, and extended press censorship. [...] The measures were a long way from the liberal principals espoused by Ibell himself. The incident left Ibell deeply shaken and in 1820 he retired into private life. [...] There are also indications that an end to Ibell's political career was triggered both by the reactionary currents that set in more generally and by increasingly stark differences with his prince on the interpretation of the constitution, notably as to whether the prince held his property on behalf of the state or on behalf of himself.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of modern aircraft engine compressors with increased pressure ratio and reduced weight {{has led to}} hightly loaded stages with transonic inflow. As a result, the design engineers of completed engines have often encountered severe aeroelastic problems, the solution {{of which could be}} difficult and costly. Therefore, tools are needed which already in the design process are able to correctly predict the aeroelastic behaviour of the blading. In the classical linearized approach the aeroelastic problem is divided into separate steps of aerodynamic and structural computations. Assuming a linear dependence of the structural and aerodynamic forces on the local deflections, the mode shapes of the structural dynamic model are used to generate harmonic motions for the calculation of airloads. In a second step the aeroelastic problem is handled by using these airloads in the governing structural equations, which are solved in the frequency domain. This requires, e. g., the solution of an eigenvalue problem, if the aeroelastic stability boundary has to be determined. However, nonlinear fluid-structure interaction caused by oscillating shocks or strong flow separation may significantly influence the aerodynamic damping and hence effect a shift of flutter boundaries. In order to investigate such aeroelastic phenomena, the governing equations of structural and fluid motion have to be simultaneaously integrated in time. The various techniques for integrating the structural together with the flow equations can be roughly divided into two methods: Time-staggered algorithms advance the structural and fluid system at subsequent time steps leading to a small time lag between the integration of structure and fluid. In contrast to this, fully coupled algorithms make use of iterative solvers to update both the structural and fluid system at the same time level. Although staggered algorithms are always leading to small errors in energy conservation, their greatest advantage is their ability to use well established discretizations and solution methods in each of the two disciplines. In this paper a technique is presented which analyzes the aeroelastic behaviour of an oscillating compressor cascade by a time-staggered method. The structural part of the governing aeroelastic equations is time-integrated according to the algorithm of Newmark, while the unsteady airloads are computed at every time step by an Euler code. The link between the two time integrations is an automatic grid generation in which the used mesh is dynamically deformed as such that it conforms with the <b>deflected</b> <b>blades</b> at every time step. The capability of this method to predict aeroelastic stability is demonstrated for subsonic and transonic flow. In order to concentrate the investigations on the principal physical effects which dominate the fluid-structure interaction in sub- and transonic flow, a very simple structural model was taken as a basis for the computations. This model consists of an assembly of twenty compressor blades performing torsional vibrations around midchord. The structural dynamic properties of each of the blades were simulated by a mass-spring-damper system performing a one-degree-of-freedom vibration under the influence of an aerodynamic moment which in general is a nonlinear function of the torsional deflection. Time series were computed for tuned and mistuned blade assemblies operating in subsonic and transonic flow. It was found that for subsonic flow the differences between time domain and frequency domain results are of negligible order. For transonic flow, however, where vibrating shocks and a temporarily choked flow in the blade channel dominate the unsteady flow, the energy transfer between fluid and structure is no longer comparable to that of a linear system. This is demonstrated by Fig. 1 showing the Iso-Machlines in adjacent blade channels 70 milliseconds after the start of the computation. The time series of the blade deflections resulting from the unsteady flow of Fig. 1 are depicted in Fig. 2 showing the pitching angles of four adjacent blades. A salient feature of this figure is the vibration of blades with odd and even numbers around different equilibrium positions and the lack of a clearly discernible traveling wave flutter mode. The results of the transonic flutter case depicted in Figures 1 and 2 clearly demonstrate that here the application of the time domain method leads to a significantly different aeroelastic behaviour of the blade assembly including a shift of the stability boundary...|$|R
40|$|Flexible blade cutting applied on thick {{layers of}} foam is very {{feasible}} for creating large sized physical models. The heated tool is set {{and moved in}} a circumferential tool motion along the front face of the layer. During these primary motions the cutting tool is positioned {{in order to ensure}} the best tool position and tool orientation for the cutting process. The adjustment of the tool position and tool orientation will introduce speed components, which will affect the cutting process. The principle of FF-TLOM cutting is to manufacture a foam layer under precise speed control. For a successful cutting process it is needed to check that no part of the cutting blade exceeds the maximum and/or minimum speed as defined for the FF-TLOM process. In this paper the secondary tool adjustments, like change in pitch, roll and yaw, are explored and the impact on the speed control is defined. The influence is first elaborated for the case of a straight cutting blade. Then the effects of a <b>deflected</b> or curved <b>blade</b> are estimated. A separation is made in a speed component along the depth of the blade and perpendicular to the blade. The speed control is influenced by an amount of parameters, making the cutting process very complex. The paper does not provide an applicable method of speed control, {{more research is needed to}} implement the adjustments into an optimized calculation method...|$|R
50|$|Rapiers are single-handed {{weapons and}} they were often {{employed}} with off-hand bucklers, daggers, cloaks and even second swords to assist with defense. A buckler is a small round shield that was used with other blades as well, such as the arming-sword. In Capo Ferro's Gran Simulacro, the treatise depicts {{how to use the}} weapon with the rotella, which is a significantly bigger shield compared with the buckler. Nevertheless, using rapier with its parrying dagger is the most common practice, and it has been arguably considered as the most suited and effective accompanying weapon for the rapier. Even though the slender blade of rapier enables the user to launch quick attack at a fairly long and advantaged distance between the user and the opponent and the protective hilt can <b>deflect</b> the opponent's <b>blade</b> when he or she uses rapier as well, the thrust-oriented weapon is weakened by its bated cutting power and relatively low maneuverability at a closer distance, where the opponent has safely passed the reach of the rapier's deadly point. Because of such insufficient cutting power and maneuverability at this situation when the opponent passes the deadly point, this scenario leaves opening for the opponent to attack the user. Therefore, some close-range protection for the user needs to be ensured if the user intends to use the rapier in an optimal way, especially when the opponent uses some slash-oriented sword like a sabre or a broadsword. A parrying dagger not only enables the users to defend in this scenario in which the rapier is not very good at protecting the user, but also enables them to attack in such close distance.|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{requirements}} related to successful utilization of plasma technology as an oil-free backup system for coal ignition and combustion stabilization in power plant boilers is provision of properly regulated pulverized coal distribution to the feed ducts leading the fuel mixture to a burner. Proper regulation of coal distribution is deemed essential for achieving an adequate pulverized coal concentration in the zone where thermal plasma is being introduced. The said can be efficiently achieved by installation of stationary louver in the coal-air mixing duct ahead of the feed ducts of a burner. The paper addresses numerical simulation of a two-phase flow of air-pulverized coal mixture in the mixing ducts, analyzing the effects of particle size distribution on pulverized coal distribution to the burner feed ducts. Numerical simulation was performed using the FLUENT 6. 3 commercial code and related poly-dispersed flow module, based on the PSI-CELL approach. Numerical experiments have been performed assuming a mono-dispersed solid phase with particle diameter ranging from 45 mm to 1200 mm. Distance between the louver blades and the resulting effect on the flow profile was analyzed as well. Results obtained indicate {{that the size of}} coal particles considerably influence the overall solid phase distribution. While fine particles, with diameters {{at the lower end of}} the above specified range, almost fully follow the streamlines of the continuous phase, coarser particles, which hit the louver <b>blades,</b> <b>deflect</b> towards the thermal plasma zone. In this manner, a desired phase concentration in the considered zone can be reached. For the said reason, installation of stationary louver have been deemed a very efficient way to induce phase separation, primarily due to more pronounced impact of the installed louver on discrete phase flow then the impact on the flow of the continuous phase...|$|R
40|$|Case-mounted fiber-optic sensors {{have been}} used by {{aircraft}} engine manufacturers mainly to monitor blade vibration in fans and compressors. The simplest probe arrangement is a spot probe where, typically, a center fiber transmits laser light, and the outer fibers collect the reflected light from the blade tips and transmit it to a photodetector. Because the spot of incident light is fixed in space, whereas the <b>blade</b> <b>deflects</b> dynamically, the reflected light will originate from slightly different portions of the blade tip under different operating conditions. Unless corrections are developed to compensate for this effect, some error in vibratory tangential amplitude will occur. For monitoring vibrations, this error is usually not critical. However, when steady-state blade deflections are being measured, {{it is very important to}} fix the spot on the blade tip at a particular location because the operating speed blade deflections are evaluated against a low-speed reference run. The change in speed usually implies a significant change in the blade orientation and possibly its shape brought about by the aerodynamic and centrifugal loading. It is most convenient to select the blade s leading and trailing edges as the fixed points for which deflections will be evaluated. To capture the blade edges at various speeds, the light probe must be movable. This was achieved by mounting the probe in an eccentric hole in a bushing that fit the fan case in the region that overlapped the path of the blade edge. The probe was actuated to search for a blade edge while all the blades were viewed on an oscilloscope. The blade edge was considered to be captured when a pulse associated with a particular blade was significantly reduced in magnitude but was clearly distinguishable from the background noise level. By tracing the axial position of either blade edge, one could extend the deflection measurement to two dimensions: axial and tangential. These blade deflection measurements were obtained during a wind tunnel test of a fan prototype...|$|R
