50|$|A further {{advantage}} of the free turbine design was {{the ease with which}} a counter-rotating engine could be designed and manufactured, simply by reversing the power turbine alone. This allowed handed engines to be made in pairs, when needed. It also allowed contra-rotating engines, where gas <b>generator</b> <b>core</b> and power turbine revolved in opposite directions, reducing the overall moment of inertia. For the helicopter engine replacement market, this ability allowed previous engines of either direction to be replaced simply. Some turboshaft engines' omni-angle freedom of their installation angle also allowed installation into existing helicopter designs, no matter how the previous engines had been arranged. In time though, the move towards axial LP compressors and so smaller diameter engines encouraged a move to the now standard layout of one or two engines set side-by-side, horizontally above the cabin.|$|E

In this way, the compression effect is achieved. The simulation {{results showed that the}} narrowest pulse generated by the delay line-based {{pulse generator}} circuit was 37 ps.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a versatile bit-error-rate (BER) testing scheme {{to characterize the}} quality of communication interfaces. Traditionally, the presilicon BER is evaluated using time-consuming software simulations. The stand-alone BER test products for postsilicon evaluation are expensive and do not include channel emulators, which are essential to testing the BER under the presence of noise. For both the design and evaluation phases, we present a scheme for BER testing in fieldprogrammable gate arrays (FPGAs) that consists of a BER tester (BERT) core and a novel additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) <b>generator</b> <b>core.</b> The maximum output value of our AWGN generator is 53, whereas that of the existing solutions is less than 7. Therefore, our generator can better emulate {{the tail of a}} Gaussian distribution, which is suitable for exploring applications at very low BERs. We also present a pipelined structure that exploits the central limit theorem for speedups of four or more. Combining a BERT and an AWGN in FPGAs is orders of magnitude more efficient in cost, volume, and energy over the existing similar-speed stand-alone solutions and has a huge speed advantage over software simulations. We demonstrate the applications of our solution through two case studies. Index Terms—Additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN), bit erro...|$|E
