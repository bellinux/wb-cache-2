5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. <b>Distilled</b> water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. Retouching and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with <b>distilled</b> water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E

5|$|Underground mine shafts, some {{reaching}} depths over , {{were created}} for the extraction of metal ores. Borehole drilling and derricks were used to lift brine to iron pans where it was <b>distilled</b> into salt.

Dangerous amounts of additional gas were siphoned off via carburetor chambers and exhaust pipes.|$|E
5|$|Arak is a Levantine {{alcoholic}} spirit (~40–63% Alc. Vol./~80–126 proof) {{from the}} anis drinks family, common in Israel {{and throughout the}} Middle East. It is a clear, colorless, unsweetened anise-flavored <b>distilled</b> alcoholic drink (also labeled as an Apéritif). It is often served neat or mixed with ice and water, which creates a reaction turning the liquor a milky-white colour. It is sometimes also mixed with grapefruit juice to create a cocktail known as 'Arak eshkoliyyot', literally 'Arak grapefruit'.|$|E
5|$|Balard found bromine {{chemicals}} in the ash of seaweed from the salt marshes of Montpellier. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard <b>distilled</b> the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried {{to prove that the}} substance was iodine monochloride (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the Latin word muria for brine.|$|E

5|$|Before the Revolution, New Englanders {{consumed}} {{large quantities}} of rum and beer as maritime trade provided relatively {{easy access to the}} goods needed to produce these items. Rum was the <b>distilled</b> spirit of choice as molasses, the main ingredient, was readily available from trade with the West Indies. In the continent's interior, colonists drank whiskey, as they had ready access to corn and rye but did not have good access to sugar cane. However, up until the Revolution, many colonists considered whiskey to be a coarse beverage unfit for human consumption, believing that it caused the poor to become raucous and disorderly.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{requirements}} {{vary greatly}} by species. In general, though, sundews require high environmental moisture content, {{usually in the}} form of a constantly moist or wet soil substrate. Most species also require this water to be pure, as nutrients, salts, or minerals in their soil can stunt their growth or even kill them. Commonly, plants are grown in a soil substrate containing some combination of dead or live sphagnum moss, sphagnum peat moss, sand, and/or perlite, and are watered with <b>distilled,</b> reverse osmosis, or rain water.|$|E

This reform was not popular with apothecaries, because it broke the {{uniformity}} of the apothecaries' pound in Germany at a time when a German national state was beginning to form.

5|$|Many farmers <b>distilled</b> their {{corn harvest}} into whiskey, {{increasing}} its value while lowering its transportation costs.

When the federal government imposed an excise tax on whiskey, Western Pennsylvania farmers felt victimized, leading to the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794. Farmers from the region rallied at Braddock's Field and marched on Pittsburgh. The short-lived rebellion was put down, however, when President George Washington sent in militias from several states.|$|E

Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or <b>distilled</b> spirit to form a tincture.|$|E
