40|$|The {{presence}} of a weak interlayer has usually an adverse effect on the slope stability. However, the rotational <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the conventional upper bound limit analysis cannot rationally describe the sliding of the failure mass along the weak interlayer. Therefore, a new <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> was proposed in this study to evaluate the stability of slopes with weak interlayers using the upper bound limit analysis and the associated factor of safety {{was determined by the}} shear strength reduction technique. The new <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> is comprised of rigid blocks undergoing rotational or translational movements, instead of the rotational movement in the conventional <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism.</b> It has also been extended to the stability analysis of slopes in {{presence of}} stabilizing piles and pore water pressures. Case studies were carried out on actual slopes with weak interlayers. The proposed rotational-translational <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> was verified by the shear strength reduction finite element method (SSRFEM). Comparisons demonstrate the reliability of limit analysis method with the proposed rotational-translational <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> for slopes with weak interlayers and therefore it {{can be used as a}} simple evaluation method for the engineering design...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} {{investigate the}} role of dark current on the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of high power photodiodes. A theoretical model built to fit the experimental data indicates that the effective barrier height and the dark current are the fundamental parameters in the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism.</b> High power, high speed photodetectors (PDs) can improve overall link performance of microwave and millimeter wave photonic systems including the link gain, noise figure, and spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). Several photodetection schemes were reported that aimed at achieving high power by optimizing physical dimension, structure type and illumination conditions [11. Although considerable power level has been achieved by several researchers, long-term reliability of high power PDs is still an unsolved issue. It is thus {{important to have a}} clear understanding of the factors that contribute to the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the PDs at high power operation. There have been several investigations on the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of high-power PDs. Paslaski et. al. suggested a <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of high power PDs relating it to the thermal origin [2]. Nespola et. a 2 investigations suggested that PDs fail along curves of constant power dissipation [3]. However, none of the previous investigations have put emphasis on the role that dark current (I d) plays in the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of the high power PDs. In this paper, we report on the experimental investigation of {{the role of}} Id on the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of high power photodiodes. A theoretical model built to fit the experimental data indicates that the Id and the effective bandgap (qh) are the fbndamental parameters in the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of high power PDs. Our investigation also shows that junction PDs (such as p-i-n) are expected to perform better than metal-semiconductor PDs for high power operations. In order to demonstrate a relation between the maximum photocurrent at failure and the Id, we teste...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA new {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) limit analysis <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{is presented}} for {{the determination of}} the critical collapse pressure of a pressurized tunnel face {{in the case of a}} soil exhibiting spatial variability in its shear strength parameters. The proposed <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> is a rotational rigid block mechanism. It is constructed in such a manner to respect the normality condition of the limit analysis theory at every point of the velocity discontinuity surfaces taking into account the spatial variation of the soil angle of internal friction. Thus, the slip surfaces of the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> are not described by standard curves such as log-spirals. Indeed, they are determined point by point using a spatial discretization technique. Though the proposed mechanism is able to deal with frictional and cohesive soils, the present paper only focuses on sands. The mathematical formulation used for the generation of the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> is first detailed. The proposed kinematical approach is then presented and validated by comparison with numerical simulations. The present <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> was shown to give results (in terms of critical collapse pressure and shape of the collapse mechanism) that compare reasonably well with the numerical simulations at a significantly cheaper computational cost...|$|R

Samples of both circular <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> and wedge <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> were considered to establish and calibrate the comprehensive models. The classification performances of different modeling approaches were analyzed and compared by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves systematically. Results show that the proposed random forest model has the highest accuracy for evaluating slope stability of circular <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism,</b> while the support vector Machine model has the highest accuracy for evaluating slope stability of wedge <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism.</b> It is demonstrated that the established random forest and the support vector machine models are effective and efficient approaches to evaluate the rockmass stability of slope...|$|R
40|$|In 1920 Prandtl {{published}} an analytical {{solution for the}} bearing capacity of a centric loaded strip footing on a weightless in-finite half-space, based on a so-called Prandtl-wedge <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Reissner extended this solution for a surrounding surcharge and Keverling Buisman and Terzaghi for the soil weight. Meyerhof and other researchers presented correction factors for {{the shape of the}} shallow foundation, which would suggest that, the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of circular shallow foundations, is related to the Prandtl-wedge <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Meyerhof and Koppejan adapted this Prandtl-wedge <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> also for pile foundations. The numerical calculations made in this article show that the Prandtl-wedge cannot be applied to circular shallow foundations and pile foundations in non-cohesive soils. The failure zone (plastic zone) below a loaded circular plate or pile tip, is far wider and deeper than the Prandtl-wedge. The calculations also show that there is, for these axisymmetric cases, failure {{both in and out of}} the standard x-y plane, but most of the failure is due to out-of-plane (tangential) failure. Therefore, this <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> is different from the Prandtl-wedge <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Also interesting are the circular and diagonal thin zones below the plate and around the pile tip, where there is no out-of-plane failure, although there is still in-plane failure. In these thin zones without out-of-plane failure, the tangential (out-of-plane) stresses are relatively high due to large shear strains, formed during previous shearing or sliding of the soil...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} better {{interpret}} failure features {{of the failure of}} soil in front of tunnel face, a new three-dimensional <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed to analyze the limit support pressure of the tunnel face in multilayered cohesive-frictional soils. The new <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> is composed of two truncated cones that represent the shear failure band and a distributed force acting on the truncated cones that represents the pressure arch effect. By introducing the concept of Terzaghi earth pressure theory, approximation of limit support pressures is calculated using the limit analysis methods.

In this paper, firstly, the similitude relation between the model pile and the prototype pile in the soil-pile interaction centrifugal modeling is derived by means of analytical equation method. Then, in order to investigate the <b>failure</b> <b>mechanism</b> of stabilizing pile, the physical properties of model materials and the difficulty of making of model pile are taken into consideration.
