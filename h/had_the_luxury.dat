5|$|With Misery we <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> {{of doing}} a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And {{we got to do}} what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in there. We were there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
25|$|By 1985 the CTC {{newsroom}} boasted 14 journalists, 3 sports {{journalists and}} a sports presenter. The nightly bulletin also <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> of three camera operators during transmission. On 10 January 1986 John Bok, {{who had become}} a high-profile personality for CTC in the Canberra community, read his last bulletin {{to take up a}} role with ABC in Adelaide. David Allen took over as the station's chief news anchor as the bulletin was scaled down to a half-hour composite, which at that time was using the Nine Network news theme and graphics.|$|E
25|$|LaMountain, {{from his}} {{position}} at Fort Monroe, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> of flying free. When he was enjoined with the Balloon Corps, he began insisting that his reconnaissance flights be made free. Lowe strictly instructed his men against free flight {{as a matter of}} policy and procedure. Eventually the two men agreed to a showdown in which LaMountain made one of his free flights. The flight was a success as a reconnaissance flight with LaMountain being able to go where he would. But on his return he was threatened by Union troops who could not identify him. His balloon was shot down, and LaMountain was treated harshly until he was clearly identified.|$|E

25|$|Hannibal, {{after his}} plundering mission was completed, {{decided to leave}} the plain, {{choosing}} not to winter there. While Fabius, with secure supply lines, <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> to sit and wait until his term as dictator expired or the Carthaginians finally attacked him, Hannibal, having stripped the area bare of all supplies, could not afford to stay put indefinitely and ultimately face a supply shortage. The Romans, guided by Fabius, still refused to attack him despite whatever provocation he came up with. Hannibal, on the other hand, did not wish to suffer severe casualties by a head-on assault on the Romans settled in fortified camps on the high ground. Since both commanders sought to fight on favorable conditions, the stalemate continued. The Carthaginian army finally moved east towards the pass beside Mount Callicula through which they had originally entered the plain. Fabius, anticipating the move, had blocked the pass with 4,000 troops, and encamped on a nearby hill with the main army. Minucius then joined this army with his contingent.|$|E
500|$|The {{challenge}} of coordinating these projects took an artistic toll on Pei. He found himself responsible for acquiring new building contracts and supervising {{the plans for}} them. As a result, he felt disconnected from the actual creative work. [...] "Design is {{something you have to}} put your hand to," [...] he said. [...] "While my people <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> of doing one job at a time, I had {{to keep track of the}} whole enterprise." [...] Pei's dissatisfaction reached its peak at a time when financial problems began plaguing Zeckendorf's firm. I.M. Pei and Associates officially broke from Webb and Knapp in 1960, which benefited Pei creatively but pained him personally. He had developed a close friendship with Zeckendorf, and both men were sad to part ways.|$|E
2500|$|In theory, {{anyone other}} than slaves and lowest class called chunmin (those who worked in despised occupations such as butchers) could take gwageo examinations, but in reality only yangban who <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> of {{spending}} much of their childhood and early adulthood [...] studying could hope to pass the exam. In the case of literary administration, children of remarried women, concubines, and officials who were dismissed for corruption were excluded from taking the exam. Gwageo examinations were very important not only for an individual but for his family because a yangban family that did not produce a government official for four generations lost their status as yangban.|$|E

2500|$|It gave up {{even more}} home runs before air {{conditioning}} was installed in 1983. Before 1983, the Dome had been nicknamed [...] "the Sweat Box." [...] The Metrodome is climate controlled, and has protected the baseball schedule during the entire time it was the venue for the Minnesota Twins. Major League Baseball schedulers <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> {{of being able to}} count on dates played at Metrodome. Doubleheader games only occurred when purposely scheduled. The last time that happened was when the Twins scheduled a day-night doubleheader against the Kansas City Royals on August 31, 2007. The doubleheader was necessitated after an August 2 game vs. Kansas City was postponed one day after the I-35W Bridge collapse in downtown Minneapolis.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{approach}} Pearl Jam took after its initial success, Vedder stated, [...] "We've <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> of writing our own job description...and that description has basically been cut {{down to just}} one line: make music." [...] The band subsequently released No Code in 1996 and Yield in 1998. In 1998, prior to Pearl Jam's U.S. Yield Tour, Irons left the band due to dissatisfaction with touring. Pearl Jam enlisted former Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron as Irons' replacement on an initially temporary basis, but he soon became a permanent replacement for Irons. [...] "Do the Evolution" [...] (from Yield) received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. In 1998, Pearl Jam recorded [...] "Last Kiss", a cover of a 1960s ballad made famous by J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers. It was released on the band's 1998 fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was {{released to the public}} as a single in 1999. [...] "Last Kiss" [...] peaked at number two on the Billboard charts and became the band's highest-charting single.|$|E
2500|$|The {{reasons for}} this big jump in the 1970s has been {{attributed}} by some scholars to widespread access to the birth control pill. While [...] "the pill" [...] was medically available in the 1960s, numerous laws restricted access to it. See, e.g., Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965) (overturning a Connecticut statute barring access to contraceptives) and Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438 (1972) (establishing the right of unmarried people to access contraception). By the 1970s, the age of majority had been lowered from 21 to 18 in the United States, largely {{as a consequence of}} the Vietnam War; this also affected women's right to effect their own medical decisions. Since it had now become socially acceptable to postpone pregnancy even while married, women <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> of thinking about other things, like education and work. Also, due to electrification women's work around the house became easier leaving them with more time to be able to dedicate to school or work. Due to the multiplier effect, even if some women were not blessed with access to the pill or electrification, many followed by the example of the other women entering the work force for those reasons. The Quiet Revolution is called such because it was not a [...] "big bang" [...] revolution; rather, it happened and is continuing to happen gradually.|$|E

60|$|The {{antecedent}} {{to these}} feminine pronouns {{had a pair}} of blue eyes, which at that moment were applied to a large round hole in the shutter of the upper window. The shutter was closed, not for any penal reasons, but because only the opposite window <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>luxury</b> of glass in it: the weather was not warm, and a round hole four inches in diameter served all the purposes of observation. The hole was, unfortunately, a little too high, and obliged the small observer to stand on a low stool of a rickety character; but Tessa would have stood a long while in a much more inconvenient position for the sake of seeing a little variety in her life. She had been drawn to the opening at the first loud tones of the strange voice speaking to Monna Lisa; and darting gently across her room every now and then to peep at something, she continued to stand there until the wood had been chopped, and she saw Baldassarre enter the outhouse, as the dusk was gathering, and seat himself on the straw.|$|E
