25|$|Both {{the main}} UK {{political}} parties had expressed {{concerns about the}} rising costs and value of a ten-yearly census, and on coming into office the UK coalition government had {{gone as far as}} suggesting that the 2011 census might be the last of its kind. In July 2010 the UK government asked ONS to explore other methods of measuring the population. In 2011 the three national statistics bodies, ONS, GROS and NISRA set up a co-ordinated research project known as Beyond 2011. The objectives of the programme were to assess the feasibility of improving UK population statistics using integrated <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> to replace or complement existing approaches, and whether alternative <b>data</b> <b>sources</b> could provide the priority statistics on the characteristics of small populations typically provided by a census. The project reported its findings in March 2014 and recommended that a UK-wide census in 2021 should take place, and that better use should be made of other demographic <b>data</b> <b>sources.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract. As {{the demand}} for {{empirical}} evidence for claims of improvements in software development and evolution has increased, the use of empirical methods such as case studies has grown. In case study methodology various types of triangulation is a commonly recommended technique for increasing validity. This study investigates a multiple <b>data</b> <b>source</b> case study {{with the objective of}} identifying whether more findings, trustworthier findings and other findings are made using multiple <b>data</b> <b>source</b> triangulation, than had a single <b>data</b> <b>source</b> been used. The case study investigated analyses key lead-time success factors for a software evolution project in a large organization developing eBusiness systems with high-availability high throughput transaction characteristics. By tracing each finding in that study to the individual evidences motivating the finding, it is suggested that a multiple <b>data</b> <b>source</b> explorative case study can have a higher validity than a single <b>data</b> <b>source</b> study. It is concluded that a careful case study design with multiple sources of evidence can result in not only better justified findings than a single <b>data</b> <b>source</b> study, but also other findings. Thus this study provides empirically derived evidence that a multiple <b>data</b> <b>source</b> case stud...|$|R

Multicast <b>data</b> <b>source</b> authentication {{must take}} into consideration the scalability and the efficiency of the underlying cryptographic schemes and mechanisms, because multicast groups can be very large and the exchanged data are likely to be important in volume (streaming). Besides, multicast <b>data</b> <b>source</b> authentication must be robust enough against packet loss because most of multicast multimedia applications do not use reliable packet delivery. In this paper, we propose a hybrid hash-chaining scheme in conjunction with an adaptive and efficient <b>data</b> <b>source</b> authentication protocol which tolerates packet loss and guarantees non-repudiation of media-streaming origin. We have simulated our protocol using NS- 2, and the simulation results show that the protocol has remarkable features and efficiency compared to other recent <b>data</b> <b>source</b> authentication protocols...|$|R
