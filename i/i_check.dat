500|$|Officer Lang {{observed}} that Drayton and Brown were wearing [...] "heavy jackets and baggy pants", despite warm weather that day. Lang suspected Brown and Drayton {{might have been}} using their baggy clothing to conceal weapons or drugs, so he asked Brown, [...] "o you mind if <b>I</b> <b>check</b> your person?" [...] Brown responded, [...] "ure", leaned up in his seat, removed a cellular phone from his pocket, and opened his jacket. Lang patted down the outside of his clothing and felt small packages [...] "similar to drug packages detected on other occasions". Officer Lang then arrested Brown, handcuffed him, and Officer Hoover walked him off the bus. Lang then asked Drayton, [...] "ind if <b>I</b> <b>check</b> you?", to which Drayton responded [...] "by lifting his hands about eight inches from his legs". Lang detected similar objects during a pat down of Drayton's legs, placed him under arrest, and escorted him off the bus. A further search determined that Brown had duct-taped three bundles containing 483 grams of cocaine between several layers of boxer shorts, and Drayton had duct-taped two bundles between several layers of boxer shorts containing 295 grams of cocaine.|$|E

When Officer Lang arrived at their row, he {{identified}} himself as a police investigator and showed his badge. In a voice [...] "just loud enough" [...] to hear, he said he was a police officer [...] "conducting bus interdiction , attempting to deter drugs and illegal weapons being transported on the bus". When Lang asked Drayton and Brown if they had any luggage on the bus, they both pointed to the same green bag on the overhead luggage rack. Lang asked, [...] "o you mind if <b>I</b> <b>check</b> it?", and Brown replied, [...] "o ahead". The officers inspected the bag and discovered no contraband inside.|$|E

500|$|Following the episode's broadcast, the show's {{producers}} and ABC were criticized for including an alleged racial slur in the episode. In {{the scene in}} which the Susan character is informed she may be entering menopause, she replies: [...] "OK, before we go any further, can <b>I</b> <b>check</b> these diplomas? Just {{to make sure they}} aren't, like, from some med school in the Philippines?" [...] Viewers called ABC to complain and an online petition had gathered 30,000 signatures by October 3, 2007, three days after the episode's original broadcast. Several politicians and medical professionals of Filipino descent, including Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Manila, condemned ABC for airing the line. On October 4, ABC announced that the episode had been removed from online platforms in order for the line to be removed; the line was also removed from future broadcasts and DVD productions of the episode. Nevertheless, network boycotts and other forms of protest continued.|$|E
500|$|ABC and the Desperate Housewives {{producers}} faced criticism {{following the}} September 30, 2007 fourth season premiere {{in which the}} character of Susan made a controversial remark about Filipino doctors. When her gynecologist suggests that she may be entering menopause, Susan responds [...] "OK, before we go any further, can <b>I</b> <b>check</b> these diplomas? Just {{to make sure they}} aren't, like, from some med school in the Philippines?" [...] Following its broadcast, viewers demanded an apology from the network. ABC issued an apology on October 3, but the controversy grew to an international concern and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III of Manila publicly sought an apology from the series' producers. Protests against the network and series were staged, prompting ABC to remove the episode from digital and online platforms in order to apply edits. As a result, the line of controversy was removed from all future broadcasts of the episode, as well as from DVD productions. However, protests continued even after this action was taken. The scene with the line in question is still viewable on YouTube.|$|E

These delicate adjustments of the balance, by which we strive to weigh to a grain the relative quantities of devotion which we may render in the service of Mammon and of God, are wholly of recent invention and application; nor have they the slightest bearing, either on the spiritual purport of the final commandment of the Decalogue, or on the distinctness of the subsequent prohibition of practical usury.|$|E

The breadth of it (deceptively enlarged in appearance by the mist) looks to my eyes beyond the reach of a leap by any pony that ever was foaled. I lose my presence of mind. At the critical moment before the jump is taken, I am foolish enough to seize the bridle, and suddenly check the pony. He starts, throws up his head, and falls instantly {{as if he had been}} shot.
