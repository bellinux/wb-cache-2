[...] Let him go where the officers lead him, and do his own duty. [...] "Will he get food enough, water enough, care enough, if he is wounded?" [...] I hope and trust in God he will; but that is not in his own power. Let him take that, too, as it comes, and do his duty. [...] "Will he be praised, rewarded, mentioned in the newspapers, if he fights well?" [...] That, too, is not in his own power. Let him take that, too, as it comes, and do his duty; and so of everything else. If the soldier on the march torments himself with these matters which are not in his own power, he is the man who will be troublesome and mutinous in time of peace, and in time of war {{will be the first to}} run away. He will tell you, [...] "A man must have justice done him; a man must see fair play for himself; a man must think of himself." [...] Poor fool! He is not thinking of himself all the while, but of a number of things which are outside him, circumstances which stand round him, and outside him, and are not himself at all. Because he thinks of them--the things outside him--he is a coward or a mutineer, while he fancies he <b>is</b> <b>taking</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> himself--as it is written, [...] "Whosoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it." ...|$|E
