5|$|Written by Phil Ford. Planned as an {{animated}} Halloween special for a 2011 broadcast. It would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> return of former series regular Maria Jackson {{and her father}} Alan who had since moved to the USA.|$|E
50|$|The song {{exists in}} many {{different}} versions - always with <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> wolf {{at the head of}} a list of other animals, and <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> wolf do things with human characteristics, such as <b>having</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> wolf, fox, and hare drink, sing and dance.|$|R
60|$|I did not argue. I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> {{mechanism}} of the primitive fighting beast, and I was as strongly impressed as if I <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> engines of a great battleship or Atlantic liner.|$|R

5|$|For much {{of recent}} history, Dhaka was {{characterized}} by roadside markets and small shops that sold {{a wide variety of}} goods. Recent years <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> widespread construction of shopping malls. Two of the largest shopping malls in Dhaka and perhaps in the Indian subcontinent are Jamuna Future Park and Bashundhara City shopping mall.|$|E
5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> fleeting view of the striped backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E

5|$|Modern mythographers <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> {{story of}} Orion {{as a way}} to access local folk tales and cultic {{practices}} directly without the interference of ancient high culture; several of them have explained Orion, each through his own interpretation of Greek prehistory and of how Greek mythology represents it. There are some points of general agreement between them: for example, that the attack on Opis is an attack on Artemis, for Opis is one of the names of Artemis.|$|E
5|$|Recent decades <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> {{growth of}} {{high-tech}} companies based around Northern England's major cities. There are eleven high-tech firms worth over $1 billion {{based in the}} region, and digital industries support around 300,000 jobs. Game development, online retail, health technology and analytics are among the major high-tech sectors in the North.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} {{suggested}} that the Games were alluded to in playwright William Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor, and used that as evidence to suggest that Shakespeare may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Games. But the allusion is not present in the quarto edition of 1602, making its first appearance in the posthumous First Folio of 1623, edited by Henry Condell and John Hemminges. It is therefore uncertain {{whether or not it was}} written by Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|The African river {{martin has}} a {{restricted}} distribution; {{it appears to}} be locally numerous, although its true status has not been fully investigated. The white-eyed river martin was discovered as recently as 1969 and is only known from specimens and anecdotal evidence â€“ no modern ornithologists <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> species in the wild, and its breeding grounds are unknown. It may be extinct, although a possible sighting was reported in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The Malla king of Nepal Srinivasa Malla {{built the}} Patan durbar (court) in 1667 AD and is {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> Matrikas dance in the durbar one night. The king ordered that the Ashta-matrika be worshipped during the Ashwin Navaratri and cost is defrayed by the durbar. The custom continues til this day. Another festival Ghorajatra is celebrated in Patan with animal sacrifices to the Matrikas.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} social {{scientific}} methods has also expanded. Social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques. The linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative, hermeneutic, and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society. Conversely, {{the end of the}} 1990s and the beginning of 2000s <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> rise of new analytically, mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques, such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis.|$|E

5|$|The resort's {{staff had}} left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool {{reception}} area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening {{for the last four}} evenings of the holiday. The message said the group's children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine's mother believes the abductor may <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> note.|$|E
5|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence, including Doppler on Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, {{akin to the}} eye of tropical cyclones. Lightning {{is said to be}} the source of illumination for those who claim to <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> interior of a tornado.|$|E
5|$|Today {{the former}} Victorian Railways {{locomotive}} fleet has {{been split into}} two, with the N, A and P classes utilised by V/Line on passenger services, with the remainder with Pacific National or other private operators in freight use. No new passenger locomotives have been built since the 1980s, with Diesel Multiple Units being acquired instead. Freight operations <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> re-powering of the G and X classes, {{as well as the}} restoration to service of stored locomotives, now up to 50 years old.|$|E

"My {{brother has}} had a long run on the hills, and a {{pleasant}} sail on the water," [...] returned Rivenoak more mildly, smiling, at the same time, in a way that his listener knew denoted pacific intentions.

Perhaps he <b>has</b> <b>seen</b> enough to change his mind, and make him hear reason." ...|$|R

5|$|Universities also placed highly on her {{education}} agenda. Legislation {{which would have}} been voted on in November 2010 would <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> introduction of a national universities regulator; however, this was delayed until 2011 following criticisms from the hig{{her education}} sector. It was also announced by her government that legislation to establish the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency would also be introduced early 2011.|$|E
5|$|Windy Nook Primary {{school is}} at Albion Street and caters for {{students}} aged between 3 and 11 years. It {{is a much}} larger than average-sized school though {{the number of students}} eligible for free school means is below average. The standard of provision is declining; in 2001 the school was named by OFSTED {{as one of the most}} successful schools in England but subsequent inspections <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> <b>the</b> school's rating decline so that in the most recent inspection the school was rated as satisfactory overall, with inconsistent levels of attainment and teaching noted.|$|E
