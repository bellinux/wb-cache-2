40|$|Controlling of Soil <b>Erosion</b> and <b>Run-off</b> <b>by</b> Vertical Mulch Technology on the Citrus Cultivation at Hill SlopeABSTRACT. The {{effects of}} {{vertical}} mulch applications on erosion control and run-off, also soil properties and fertility on citrus cultivations at hill slope {{had been done}} in July to November, 2007 in buffer zone of Gunung Leuser National Park, Rumah Galuh Village, Sei Bingei Sub-district, Langkat district, with 560 meters altitude, and 22, 5 % land slope. Two vertical mulch application are: vertical mulch having the same aim with contour line, and ring vertical mulch. The conservations methods were studied are pile having the same aim with contour line, pile ring, ring of mulch in gunny-sack. Two control experiments are: horizontal mulch application, and without mulch application. These result are: vertical mulch applications could control erosion and run-off and affected physical and chemical soil properties better than horizontal mulch application. The best of conservation methods application where controlling erosion and and run-off are contour pile and mulch in gunny-sack, and affected on soil physical and biological properties are ring vertical mulch, but for affecting soil chemical properties are mulch in gunny-sack...|$|R
40|$|Using {{industrial}} by-products (IBPs) {{in conjunction}} with vegetated buffer strips (VBSs) {{has the potential to}} be a cost-effective strategy for tackling phosphorus (P) export from agricultural land. Using an integrated mesocosm approach, we examined the effect of surface application of IBPs within VBSs on the removal of P fractions in surface and sub-surface flow. Artificial run-off was applied to VBSs (1. 2 m long × 0. 4 m wide, and 5 % slope) that were amended with either 20 t ha− 1 of Al-based water treatment residual (Al-WTR) or 20 t ha− 1 of ochre, or remained as unamended controls. To explore the persistence of the effects of amendment over multiple run-off events, two 30 -minute artificial run-off events (3 litre minute− 1) were applied to the mesocosms over a period of five days. When compared with inflow concentrations, the unamended VBSs reduced total P (37 – 54 %) and particulate P (61 – 64 %) concentrations in surface run-off, but increased soluble reactive P (SRP) (5 – 9 %) and total dissolved P concentrations (4 – 8 %). Enhancing VBSs with IBPs improved retention of soluble P fractions in surface run-off, for example, 61 – 62 and 15 – 19 % of the SRP in the inflow was retained in VBSs amended with Al-WTR and ochre, respectively. Surface application of either ochre or Al-WTR also reduced the concentrations of soluble P fractions in sub-surface flow. The magnitude of these effects depended on inflow P concentrations. Unlike Al-WTR, the effectiveness of ochre gradually declined over the duration of each run-off event because of <b>erosion</b> of ochre <b>by</b> <b>run-off...</b>|$|R
40|$|Phreatomagmatic fall, low-concentration PDC {{deposits}} and remobilized equivalents dominate {{the products of}} craters (tuff cones/rings) of Koko fissure, south-east Oahu. At Koko crater, Fisher (1977) described "U-shaped" channels, which he interpreted as due to <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> low-concentration PDCs (surges), with minor modification by stream and debris flows. Similar channels on tuff cones and rings {{elsewhere in the world}} have been interpreted as "surge-eroded" by subsequent authors. However, no evidence for <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> PDCs was observed during recent fieldwork, which suggested rather the following model. An important observation is that initial incision is always correlated with the emplacement of vesiculated ash layers (derived from Hanauma Bay), and is only very rarely associated with other facies. Incision of the vesiculated ash <b>by</b> <b>run-off</b> generated an initial and widespread network of sinuous, narrow (< 15 cm) and shallow (< 15 cm) rills. The strong correlation of rills with vesiculated ash and the lack of obvious water-escape structures in these ashes implies that run-off was mostly derived from associated steam-rich plumes. Initial steam and rain-fed incision was probably also enhanced in these very fine-grained cohesive deposits as a consequence of lowered infiltration rates. The rill network developed locally into deeper channels (i. e. gullies) during steam and rain-fed <b>run-off,</b> and <b>by</b> significant <b>erosion</b> during emplacement of vesiculated (hot) debris flows, derived from remobilized vesiculated ash. Pyroclastic density currents from Hanuama Bay traveling laterally across the flank of Koko Crater, perpendicular to the gully axes, provided the bulk of the gully fills, but gave rise to little or no modification of their margins. Rill and gully development by rainfall alone could explain similar examples of incision of low-concentration PDC deposits elsewhere in the world, but the possibility of steam-fed rills and <b>erosion</b> <b>by</b> hot debris flows should be considered. Low-concentration PDCs {{do not seem to be}} able to erode their substrate in all cases...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{physical}} degradation is a {{major environmental}} problem throughout the world due to its negative impact on biomass and economic production. This study presented new ways of combining rapid soil analysis using GIS and remote sensing imagery to provide a precision mapping of soil physical condition indicators {{in the study area}} and producing fertility status using Geostatistical approach. Study has been carried out to map the areas with physical degradation using remotely sensed data from Indian Remote Sensing LISS III sensor. It was observed that the data enabled better delineation of small units of eroded areas. Satellite data have been used for qualitative assessment of areas, being subject to soil erosion. Soil erosion was found to be none or slight to very sever using visual interpretation of IRS data along with field survey method where soil erosion was found to be moderate to high using the RUSLE method. The eroded areas of degraded lands will be used as an input for planning reclamation and conservation programs in Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka. Soil compaction is a form of physical degradation resulting in densification and distortion of the soil where biological activity, porosity and permeability are reduced, strength is increased and soil structure partly destroyed. Compaction can reduce water infiltration capacity and increase <b>erosion</b> risk <b>by</b> accelerating <b>run-off.</b> The compaction process can be initiated by wheels, tracks, rollers or by the passage of animals. Some soils are naturally compacted, strongly cemented or have a thin topsoil layer on rock subsoil. Soils can vary from being sufficiently strong to resist all likely applied loads to being so weak that they are compacted by even light loads...|$|R
