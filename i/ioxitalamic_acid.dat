40|$|For {{perioperative}} prophylaxis 200 mg ciprofloxacin {{were administered}} as a short intravenous infusion to 17 patients aged 57 - 84 years before transurethral resection (TUR-P) or transvesicular enucleation (TVP) of the prostate. 13 patients were injected simultaneously with 2. 5 g <b>ioxitalamic</b> <b>acid</b> i. v. {{to determine the}} kidney function. In 11 patients the plasma concentrations were assayed and the pharmacokinetic parameters calculated. At the end of infusion the concentrations of ciprofloxacin in plasma reached 4. 2 +/- 0. 8 microgram/ml and decreased after a fast distribution period (plasma half-life 0. 20 +/- 0. 09 h) with a terminal half-life of 4. 2 +/- 1. 3 h to 0. 2 +/- 0. 09 microgram/ml after 10 h. The apparent volume of distribution in steady state was 183 +/- 45 % of body weight, the plasma clearance 457 +/- 146 ml/min/ 70 kg. The average concentrations in prostatic adenoma tissue were at all sampling times higher (2 fold) than in plasma. The mean concentrations in prostatic secretion were {{about half of the}} respective plasma concentrations. High concentrations of the concomitantly administered <b>ioxitalamic</b> <b>acid</b> in prostatic secretion are considered as an indicator of urinary contamination. In those patients high ciprofloxacin concentrations in prostatic secretion are not reliable...|$|E
40|$|In plasma {{and urine}} of 10 healthy volunteers after {{intravenous}} administration of 4 g mezlocillin and piperacillin, respectively, the parent compounds {{as well as}} degradation products were assayed by high-performance liquid chromatography. <b>Ioxitalamic</b> <b>acid,</b> a renal contrast medium, was administered simultaneously, {{in order to measure}} the glomerular filtration rate, and to control the collection of 24 -h urine. As metabolite of mezlocillin the corresponding penicilloic acid only was found, whereas in the case of piperacillin a further degradation product was observed. Half of the doses given was recovered in the urine as unchanged drugs, and in addition 5 - 10 % as metabolites. No differences were found in the pharmacokinetic behaviour of both antibiotics...|$|E
40|$|Fleroxacin {{is a new}} {{fluoroquinolone}} with a broad antibacterial {{spectrum and}} a serum half-life of about 8 - 12 h. Eighty percent of 400 isolates from complicated or hospital-acquired urinary tract infections were inhibited by a concentration of 1 mg/l and 95 % by 4 mg/l. As with other quinolones, fleroxacin is less active in acid urine (pH 5. 4) than in Mueller-Hinton broth (pH 7. 4). In 12 healthy volunteers the concentrations of fleroxacin were measured in plasma and seminal and prostatic fluid 2, 4 and 12 h after an oral dose of 400 mg. The mean plasma concentrations {{of three or four}} volunteers at each time were 4. 2, 3. 6 and 1. 2 mg/l, respectively. The corresponding prostatic fluid/plasma ratios were 0. 30, 0. 27 and 1. 96, respectively. By concomittant administration of <b>ioxitalamic</b> <b>acid</b> it could be demonstrated that in samples obtained 12 h after administration urinary contamination must be considered. Fleroxacin is concentrated in seminal fluid by a median ratio of 1. 7. In 13 elderly patients the prostatic fluid and prostatic adenoma tissue concentrations were determined one to four hours following oral administration of 400 mg. The concentrations in prostatic fluid were similar to those of volunteers. The tissue concentrations exceeded plasma concentrations by only about 10 % (median). Fleroxacin is very active against isolates causing complicated UTI. Concentrations in seminal and prostatic fluid and prostatic adenoma tissue are sufficiently high to treat bacterial prostatitis or vesiculitis caused by susceptible bacterial strains...|$|E
