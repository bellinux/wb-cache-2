As a synthesis technique, electrodeposition is a simple and scalable process to produce non-wetting metal surfaces. There are three main categories of superhydrophobic surfaces made by electrodeposition: (i) <b>electrodeposits</b> that are inherently non-wetting due to hierarchical roughness generated from the process; (ii) <b>electrodeposits</b> with plated surface roughness that are further modified with low surface energy material; (iii) composite <b>electrodeposits</b> with co-deposited inert and hydrophobic particles.

XRD results showed that the dominant phases of the ZnNiAl 2 O 3 <b>electrodeposits</b> were mixtures of Zn 21 Ni 5 and Zn 22 Ni 3 phases together with as Al 2 O 3. The Ni content measured in the <b>electrodeposits</b> using EDS varied from 9. 73 to 13. 47 wt%. SEM results showed that finer and smoother surface <b>electrodeposits</b> were obtained by pulsed current electrodeposition at a low (33 %) duty cycle. In addition, the corrosion properties of the <b>electrodeposits</b> were characterized by Tafel plots and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), while the microhardness of the <b>electrodeposits</b> was measured by a Vickers hardness tester. In summary, this study revealed that pulsed current electrodeposition at a 33 % duty cycle led to a finer and smoother surface morphology, an enhanced strength, a greater corrosion resistance, and a higher Ni content in the ZnNiAl 2 O 3 composite coatings compared to plating at higher duty cycles or plating through DC electrodeposition...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Tin <b>electrodeposits</b> produced from aqueous electrolytes are frequently used within the electronics industry due to their high solderability and corrosion protection. One limitation to using these deposits is their spontaneous formation of long conductive filament whiskers. These whiskers grow post-electrodeposition and {{increase the risk of}} unwanted electrical shorts within electronic devices. In this thesis, tin <b>electrodeposits</b> produced from a proprietary bright acid Tinmac electrolyte, currently used in industry, were studied. <b>Electrodeposits</b> were produced using a range of current densities with and without agitation and were characterised with respect to crystallographic orientation, topography and surface finish. Moreover, the intermetallic compound (IMC) growth produced at the copper substrate-tin coating interface was assessed {{over a period of time}} as its growth is considered to be a significant driving force behind whisker formation. In addition, a technique for the electrochemical anodic oxidation of tin <b>electrodeposits</b> on copper substrates was developed. This technique was used throughout this project for the study of IMC growth from tin <b>electrodeposits</b> as it was able to effectively remove the tin whilst leaving the IMCs and substrate unaffected. Ionic liquids exhibit promising electrochemical characteristics for electrodeposition but are still not widely utilised in industry. Their ability to deposit tin coatings has been studied in the present investigation. Trials concentrated on process optimisation to produce uniform <b>electrodeposits</b> by varying current density, SnCl 2. 2 H 2 O concentration, and electrolyte composition. These deposits were then characterised and compared to tin coatings of similar thickness produced from Tinmac with respect to topography, surface finish, crystallographic orientation, IMC growth, and whisker propensity. <b>Electrodeposits</b> produced from the ionic liquid electrolyte exhibited a different crystallographic texture, topography, and IMC growth compared to those produced from Tinmac. Moreover, the deposit produced from the ionic liquid featured increased whisker growth compared to those produced from Tinmac, but in a wider context, far less growth than conventional tin <b>electrodeposits</b> in the literature. In addition, by exploiting other electrochemical characteristics of ionic liquids, such as their large potential window, future work may be able to produce novel tin or tin alloy <b>electrodeposits</b> which may further reduce the whisker propensity of deposits produced in this investigation...|$|R

40|$|As {{a result}} of their unique, but well-behaved structure-property relationships, {{porosity}} free nanostructured <b>electrodeposits</b> in the form of thin and thick coatings, free-standing sheet, foil or wire, and complex shapes, are rapidly finding applications in many different areas. Because of the large driving force for grain growth in these materials, however, their thermal stability may be a critical issue for some applications. This paper reviews previous grain growth studies of nanostructured <b>electrodeposits.</b> Thermal stability has been evaluated using several different experimental approaches. Calorimetric studies of nanocrystalline nickel based <b>electrodeposits</b> have shown a general trend of increasing thermal stability by alloying with either P or Fe. There is, however, little agreement between the various studies in terms of suggested growth mechanisms. Indeed, because of the large range of annealed structures obtained from different annealing treatments, several distinct growth mechanisms have been suggested. Recent grain growth studies of nanostructured Ni <b>electrodeposits,</b> covering a much broader range of annealing conditions than used before, have shown that the multiple types of previously reported annealed structures are in fact the product of a multi-staged growth process...|$|R

50|$|A {{metal foil}} is most {{commonly}} used as the conductive element of a flexible laminate. The metal foil is the material from which the circuit paths are normally etched. A wide variety of metal foils of varying thickness are available {{from which to choose}} and create a flex circuit, however copper foils, serve the vast majority of all flexible circuit applications. Copper’s excellent balance of cost and physical and electrical performance attributes make it an excellent choice. There are actually many different types of copper foil. The IPC identifies eight different types of copper foil for printed circuits divided into two much broader categories, <b>electrodeposited</b> and wrought, each having four sub-types.) As a result, {{there are a number of}} different types of copper foil available for flex circuit applications to serve the varied purposes of different end products. With most copper foil, a thin surface treatment is commonly applied to one side of the foil to improve its adhesion to the base film. Copper foils are of two basic types: wrought (rolled) and <b>electrodeposited</b> and their properties are quite different. Rolled and annealed foils are the most common choice, however thinner films which are electroplated are becoming increasingly popular.|$|E
