All GMOs, along with irradiated food, are considered [...] "new food" [...] and subject to extensive, case-by-case, science based food evaluation by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). The criteria for authorization fall in four broad categories: [...] "safety," [...] "freedom of choice," [...] "labelling," [...] and [...] "traceability." [...] The EFSA reports to the European Commission who then draft a proposal for granting or refusing the authorisation. This proposal is submitted to the Section on GM Food and Feed of the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health and if accepted it will be adopted by the EC or {{passed on to the}} Council of Agricultural Ministers. Once in the Council it has three months to reach a qualified majority for or against the proposal, if no majority is reached the proposal is passed back to the EC who will then adopt the proposal. However, even after authorization, individual EU member states can ban individual varieties under a 'safeguard clause' if there are [...] "justifiable reasons" [...] that the variety may cause harm to humans or the environment. The member state must then supply sufficient evidence that this is the case. [...] The Commission is obliged to investigate these cases and either overturn the original registrations or request the country to withdraw its temporary restriction. The laws of the EU also stipulated that member nations establish coexistence regulations.

In this paper, we analyzed the impacts of two different climate change scenarios on optimal field management practices in winterwheat and <b>grain</b> <b>maize</b> production with case studies from Switzerland. Management options included nitrogen fertilization (amount, timing and allocation) as well as irrigation. Optimal solutions that maximize the farmer’s utility were sought {{with the help of}} a bioeconomic modeling system that integrated the process-based crop growth model CropSyst into an economic decision model. The latter accounted not only for the crop specific average profit margins, but also for production risks, reflecting the utility (expressed as the certainty equivalent) of a risk-averse farmer’s management decisions at field scale. In view of the non-linearity and complexity of the problem, we used a genetic algorithm as optimization technique. For <b>grain</b> <b>maize,</b> our results showed that climate change will foster the use of irrigation, not only at sites prone to water limitation already under current climatic conditions, but more in general for climate change scenarios projecting a substantial decrease in summer precipitation.

40|$|Uncertainty in {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distribution of rainfall in regional crop yield simulations comprises a major fraction of the error on crop model simulation results. In this paper we used an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate coarse resolution satellite microwave sensor derived soil moisture estimates (SWI) for correcting errors in the water balance of the world food studies (WOFOST) crop model. Crop model simulations with the EnKF for winter wheat and <b>grain</b> <b>maize</b> were carried out for Spain, France, Italy and Germany for the period 1992 ¿ 2000. The results were evaluated {{on the basis of}} regression with known crop yield statistics at national and regional level. Moreover, the EnKF filter innovations were analysed to see if any systematic trends could be found that could indicate deficiencies in the WOFOST water balance. Our results demonstrate that the assimilation of SWI has clearly improved the relationship with crop yield statistics for winter wheat for the majority of regions (66 %) where a relationship could be established. For <b>grain</b> <b>maize</b> the improvement is less evident because improved relationships could only be found for 56 % of the regions. We suspect that partial crop irrigation could explain the relatively poor results for <b>grain</b> <b>maize,</b> because irrigation is not included in the model. Analyses of the filter innovations revealed {{spatial and temporal}} patterns, while the distribution of normalised innovations is not Gaussian and has a non-zero mean indicating that the EnKF performs suboptimal. The non-zero mean is caused by differences in the mean value of the forecasted and observed soil moisture climatology, while the excessive spread in the distribution of normalised innovations indicates that the error covariances of forecasts and observations have been underestimated.

40|$|Aflatoxin {{is a human}} carcinogen, {{produced}} by fungus Aspergillus flavus that frequently contaminates maize. Analysis of A. flavus by plate counting and aflatoxin by Thin Layer Chromatography were performed on 104 samples and 25 samples, respectively, of <b>maize</b> <b>grain</b> and <b>maize</b> based food products from different places in Bogor-West Java, Boyolali-Central Java and Bojonegoro-East Java. These regions support significant number of maize production in Java. Forty percent of the samples were contaminated by A. flavus, whereas aflatoxin level of higher than 20 ppb was found in 4 of 25 samples. The highest contamination level of A. flavus was found at the collector trader that often stored the <b>maize</b> <b>grain</b> in average of 15 days, at room temperature. There was a significant correlation between the length of storage as well as relative humidity with the contamination levels of A. flavus. Significant correlation was also found between the contamination levels of A. flavus {{with the level of}} aflatoxin in <b>maize</b> <b>grain.</b> However, no significant correlation was found between the aflatoxin level and the contamination levels of A. flavus in the processed maize based food products...|$|R
