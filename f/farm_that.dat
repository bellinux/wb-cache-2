The workstations were linked to a 54-processor render <b>farm</b> <b>that</b> could render 10 to 15 shots an hour. Beginning with season five, the animators began using Maya instead of PowerAnimator. The studio now runs a 120-processor render <b>farm</b> <b>that</b> can produce 30 or more shots an hour.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} link between farm {{investment}} and farm performance considering two types of <b>farms</b> <b>that</b> may have a different investment strategy: <b>farms</b> <b>that</b> are intensive in capital, and <b>farms</b> <b>that</b> have a low capital intensity. Panel data on specialized dairy farms of one sub-region of French Brittany (Ille-et-Vilaine) for the period 2005 - 2014 were used. Results from adjustment cost models indicate <b>that</b> <b>farms</b> tend to smooth their investments to limit adjustment cost and <b>that</b> <b>farm</b> performance has {{a negative impact on}} investment...|$|R
30|$|Linear {{programming}} (LP) {{has been}} widely used to solve company resource allocation problems. The ability of this method to predict how companies will adjust to changes {{in a variety of}} exogenous factors is well known, and when used at the company level it enables aggregation problems to be avoided. In this type of research, the goal is to maximize profit estimated as gross margin. In the present study, we applied the LP model to <b>farms</b> <b>that</b> utilize three different irrigation sources. To design the models, the farms in the study were divided into three groups based on resource of irrigation, <b>farms</b> <b>that</b> use canal water from Drodzan Dam for irrigation, <b>farms</b> <b>that</b> use well water and <b>farms</b> <b>that</b> use a combination of canal and well water for irrigation.|$|R

5|$|In Poland, notable {{imports from}} Arabia {{included}} those of Prince Hieronymous Sanguszko (1743–1812), {{who founded the}} Slawuta stud. Poland's first state-run Arabian stud farm, Janów Podlaski, was established by the decree of Alexander I of Russia in 1817, and by 1850, the great stud farms of Poland were well-established, including Antoniny, owned by the Polish Count Potocki (who had married into the Sanguszko family); later notable as the <b>farm</b> <b>that</b> produced the stallion Skowronek.|$|E
5|$|In her {{arguments}} for republican virtue, Wollstonecraft invokes an emerging middle-class ethos {{in opposition to}} what she views as the vice-ridden aristocratic code of manners. Influenced by Enlightenment thinkers, she believed in progress and derides Burke for relying on tradition and custom. She argues for rationality, pointing out that Burke's system {{would lead to the}} continuation of slavery, simply because it had been an ancestral tradition. She describes an idyllic country life in which each family can have a <b>farm</b> <b>that</b> will just suit its needs. Wollstonecraft contrasts her utopian picture of society, drawn with what she says is genuine feeling, to Burke's false feeling.|$|E
5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is named}} for J. Johnston Pettigrew a Confederate General who lies buried in the family {{cemetery}} in the park.

Taking his discharge in 1944, Murray returned to his farm and died in 1966 at the age of 85.|$|E
5|$|The Gilwell Farmhouse is {{believed}} to date from the early 18th century, making it the oldest original building at Gilwell Park. It is composed of two buildings that were joined together. There is a brick well head on the <b>farm</b> <b>that</b> {{is known as the}} Gil Well. A field adjoining the boundaries of Gilwell Park, known as Bill Oddie Field, affords dramatic views of the London skyline over Pole Hill, Chingford. The field was so-named after employees of The Scout Association spotted TV ornithologist Bill Oddie recording a programme about circling birds of prey on the field in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Whiteside {{was born}} on October 22, 1979, in New Albany, Mississippi. He was raised on an 80-acre <b>farm</b> <b>that</b> belonged to his grandfather. Whiteside {{attended}} W. P.

5|$|After sending Meg out on {{an errand}} {{to pick up her}} grandfather, Lois {{continues}} to seduce Anthony, having been interested in him since Peter had begun insulting her about her advancing age. Quickly returning after forgetting the car keys, Meg discovers her mother making out with her new boyfriend on the couch. The bass jingle used extensively in the long-running NBC sitcom Seinfeld is then heard, with the scene pausing, before transitioning to the Jolly Farm studio. In a surprise visit to the Griffin family home, Julie unexpectedly appears when Stewie opens the front door. Expecting Julie to recognize him, he forgets that he is not dressed as Karina, causing him to hurriedly change clothing, while pretending to have an argument with his fabricated persona. A similar scene is featured in the 1993 film Mrs. Doubtfire, starring actor Robin Williams. Stewie and Jolly Farm make a reference to Pan Am Flight 103, a Boeing 747–100 destroyed by a terrorist bomb over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 occupants. Large portions of the plane fell onto Lockerbie, which killed 11 people, escalating the death toll to 270. A song features on Jolly <b>Farm</b> <b>that</b> explicitly describes debris from the newly disintegrated plane falling into Lockerbie, sung in the fashion of that of a nursery rhyme.|$|E
