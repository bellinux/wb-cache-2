5|$|GE has {{installed}} a prototype wind turbine with onboard battery {{similar to that}} of an electric car, equivalent of 1 minute of production. Despite the small capacity, it is enough to guarantee that power output complies with forecast for 15 minutes, as the battery is used to eliminate the difference rather than provide full output. In certain cases the increased predictability can be used to take wind power penetration from 20 to 30 or 40 per cent. The battery cost can be retrieved by selling burst power on demand and reducing backup needs from <b>gas</b> <b>plants.</b>|$|E
5|$|While other {{refineries}} {{would keep}} the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to <b>gas</b> <b>plants.</b> Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost $2.50 each ended up only $.96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.|$|E

5|$|Wind farms {{consist of}} many {{individual}} wind turbines which {{are connected to}} the electric power transmission network. Onshore wind is an inexpensive source of electric power, competitive with or in many places cheaper than coal or <b>gas</b> <b>plants.</b> Offshore wind is steadier and stronger than on land, and offshore farms have less visual impact, but construction and maintenance costs are considerably higher. Small onshore wind farms can feed some energy into the grid or provide electric power to isolated off-grid locations.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong {{was born}} in what would soon become the {{province}} of Ontario in 1867. After briefly teaching school, he entered the business industry, as a druggist. After initially gaining experience in politics on the council of Eastnor Township, he relocated west {{to the city of}} Edmonton, Alberta. In Edmonton, he established his pharmaceutical business once again and worked briefly with his brother on real estate and construction projects. In 1907, he ran for election to the Edmonton City Council and was elected to a two-year term. In 1910, he decided to run for the mayoralty in the municipal election; uncontested as the only nominated candidate on election day, Armstrong was acclaimed to the mayor's chair for the upcoming year. During his term, several issues were brought up to attention, including the city's need of a new civic building and the possibility of two new <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> for the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{magnitude}} of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants; California, where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission benefits. The U.K. also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as natural <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> dominate the generation mix. On the other hand, emission benefits in Germany, China, India, and the central regions of the United States are limited or non-existent because most electricity is generated from coal. However these countries and regions might still obtain some air quality benefits by reducing local air pollution in urban areas. Cities with chronic air pollution problems, such as Los Angeles, México City, Santiago, Chile, São Paulo, Beijing, Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Nevertheless, {{the location of the}} plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global.|$|E

25|$|From its {{original}} development until the wide-scale adoption of natural gas, more than 50,000 manufactured <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> {{were in existence}} in the United States alone. The process of manufacturing gas usually produced a number of by-products that contaminated the soil and groundwater {{in and around the}} manufacturing plant, so many former town <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> are a serious environmental concern, and cleanup and remediation costs are often high. Manufactured <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> (MGPs) were typically sited near or adjacent to waterways that were used to transport in coal and for the discharge of wastewater contaminated with tar, ammonia and/or drip oils, as well as outright waste tars and tar-water emulsions.|$|E

25|$|In 1957, a new {{gas plant}} at Taylor, near Fort St. John, British Columbia, began {{supplying}} Westcoast Transmission Co. Ltd. This plant's practices differed from {{those used in}} Alberta {{in a number of}} ways. For example, although it generally required dehydration, sweetening and processing for liquid hydrocarbons, companies transported the natural gas from northeastern British Columbia long distances before processing it further. Consequently, while planning the Westcoast pipeline, the field operators agreed to process all the gas at a single facility, rather than have individual <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> in every major production area. At 10 million cubic metres per day, the Taylor plant had the capacity to process as much natural gas as all eleven of the other <b>gas</b> <b>plants</b> operating in Canada combined. The plant was also by far Canada's most northerly. Heavily insulated buildings protected the processing facilities and allowed them to function at temperatures typical of more southerly climes.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} sources point to the misuse of {{hydroelectric}} dams {{as a cause of}} the floods.
