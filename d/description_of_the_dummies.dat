I t is treated as a one degree of freedom linear oscillatory system, working predominantly in the vertical direction. A discussion of various AVCS models and respective linear control laws is followed by a short <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> full-scale <b>dummy</b> system aimed for <b>the</b> driver's seats <b>of</b> heavy earth-moving machines and trucks.

Savinio founded the musical movement Sincerismo (Sincerism) this same year. Sincerismo largely abandoned polyphony and harmony in favor of dissonance and rhythm as its primary musical characteristics. That year also saw <b>the</b> publication <b>of</b> [...] (<b>The</b> Songs <b>of</b> Half-Death), a dramatic poem including original illustrations and a piano suite accompaniment, both also created by Savinio. [...] was written primarily in French, but also included passages written in Italian. <b>The</b> poem consisted <b>of</b> a single act, containing four loosely linked scenes.
