50|$|The <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> {{trade is}} the {{buying and selling}} of {{stingray}} <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> for their use in Traditional Chinese medicine. The <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> are harvested from stingrays that are caught intentionally, or caught as bycatch. The plates are sold whole or in a powder form. It is believed that the stingrays <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> hold medicinal properties that cure everything from arthritis to cancers. A single kilogram of the <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> can be sold for up to $350 USD, however, the price varies by ray species.|$|R
40|$|The gill {{cleaning}} movements ofLimulus {{occur in}} definite periods (bouts). The sequence of movements in a bout, and the movements themselves, are highly stereotyped. In {{a bout of}} gill cleaning the paired <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> are adducted across the midline so that opposite <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> can interact. The interaction consists of rhythmic flicking of the inner lobe of a <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> between the book gill lamellae of the contralateral gill. Each bout of cleaning lasts for approximately one minute and {{can be divided into}} four basic phases: pairing, crossing over, lateral cleaning, and medial cleaning (Fig. 2). There are two distinct pairing arrangements of the <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> during cleaning. During left leading (LL) cleaning all the <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> are paired with an adjacent <b>gill</b> <b>plate,</b> except L 1 and R 5. During right leading (RL) cleaning, which is the mirror image of LL cleaning, all the gills are paired except for R 1 and L 5 (Fig. 3). Cleaning bouts are further organized into long-term patterns which last for hours (Fig. 4). There are four major muscle groups involved in gill cleaning. Muscles 48 / 115 adduct the <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> across the midline; muscles 113 / 114 flick the inner lobe, and muscles 20 (remotor) and 22 (promotor) control the anterior-posterior position of the <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> during cleaning. The patterns of activity of these muscles are reliably different during RL and LL cleaning (Fig. 5). Each abdominal ganglion controls the movements of a pair of <b>gill</b> <b>plates.</b> During a bout of cleaning one member of the pair is being cleaned (subprogram A) and the other is not being cleaned (subprogram B). It is suggested that there are higher-order interganglionic neurons which control the expression of either the RL or LL patterns of cleaning. This is accomplished by dictating which <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> of a pair uses subprogram A and which subprogram B, for all five ganglia. It is concluded that a gill cleaning bout constitutes a moderately complex fixed action pattern, meeting the criteria of stereotypy within and between animals, intricacy of appendage movements, involvement of more than one effector system, and tendency to occur in its entirety in the absence of apparent stimuli (vacuum activity) ...|$|R

40|$|Continuously {{increasing}} demand for {{plant and animal}} products causes unsustainable depletion of biological resources. It is estimated that one-quarter of sharks and rays are threatened worldwide and although the global fin trade is widely recognized as a major driver, demand for meat, liver oil, and <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> also represents a significant threat. This study used DNA barcoding and 16 [*]S rRNA sequencing as a method to identify shark and ray species from dried fins and <b>gill</b> <b>plates,</b> obtained in Canada, China, and Sri Lanka. 129 fins and <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> were analysed and searches on BOLD produced matches to 20 species of sharks and five species of rays or – in two cases – to a species pair. Twelve of the species found are listed or have been approved for listing in 2017 in the appendices of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora (CITES), including the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), which was surprisingly found among both shark fin and <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> samples. More than half of identified species fall under the IUCN Red List categories ‘Endangered’ and ‘Vulnerable’, raising further concerns about the impacts of this trade on the sustainability of these low productivity species...|$|R
5000|$|Stingrays {{are caught}} by fishing lines or nets.

The <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> are split in two and dried after they are taken from the dead rays. Once dried the plates are sold whole or ground into a powder.|$|R
50|$|The two pelvic fins are {{overlaid}} by {{skin for}} most of their length and fused to form a single spine, terminated by very short rays, their only external evidence. <b>Gill</b> <b>plates</b> opercula, although present, are also not visible, overlaid by the tough skin, covered with rough, rhomboid scales that form a stout armor on their bodies. The only gill opening is a vertical slit, directly above the pectoral fins. This peculiar covering of the <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> is shared {{with other members of the}} Tetradontae. Each jaw contains a row of four teeth on either side, while the upper jaw contains an additional set of six plate-like pharingeal teeth.|$|R
50|$|The {{brightly colored}} <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> of the pumpkinseed sunfish {{also serve as}} a method of {{protection}} and dominance. Also known as an eye spot, the dark patch at the posterior of the <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> provides the illusion that the eye of the fish is larger and positioned further back on the body, thus making the fish seem up to four times larger than it actually is. When a pumpkinseed feels threatened by a predator, it flares its gills to make it seem larger in size, and shows off the flashy red coloration. Males of the species also flare their gills in the spring spawning season in a show of dominance and territoriality.|$|R

40|$|Heart {{electrical}} activity (ECGs), gill closer muscle potentials (EMGs), and blood pressures {{in the heart}} and the branchiocardiac canals, were measured in adult horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus) during various activities. During ventilation, hyperventilation, and swimming, large transient increases in pressures (10 - 35 cm H 2 O) occur in the branchiocardiac canals, which carry blood from the gills to the heart. These pulses of positive pressure are related to, and apparently caused by, <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> closing. During quiescent periods, with no ventilatory activity, there are no pressure pulses in the canals, but the pressure is still greater than zero. We found covariation of heart and ventilation rates during intermittent ventilation, hyperventilation, gill cleaning, and swimming, as well as evidence of transient periods of phasic coordination. The heart appears to be weakly entrained to the gill rhythm by phasic cardioregulatory nerve input. The preferred phase of heartbeats, with respect to gill rhythm, was 0. 5, or 180 degrees out of phase. In some animals, intra-cardiac pressures were enhanced when the heart and gill rhythms were entrained. We suggest that rhythmic movements of the <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> enhance the flow of low pressure blood returning from the body to the heart. Thus, ventilatory appendage movements may constitute an accessory blood pumping mechanism in Limulus...|$|R
50|$|But the {{majority}} of T-64As were still modernised after 1981, by mounting a six smoke grenade-launcher 81&thinsp;mm 902A {{on each side of}} the gun, and by replacing the <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> by a rubber skirt for a longer life. Some of them seem to have been fitted after 1985 with reactive bricks (as the T-64AV), or even with laser TPD-K1 telemeters instead of the optical TPD-2-49 optical coincidence rangefinder (1981). Almost all T-64s were modernised into T-64R, between 1977 and 1981, by reorganising external storage and snorkels, similar to the T-64A.|$|R
5000|$|A few {{biological}} factors {{known as}} K-selected traits make the stingray {{more susceptible to}} population decline. These K-selected traits include {{but are not limited}} to: late sexual maturity, long gestation, low and number of offspring. Because the <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> trade will accept plates from immature and mature rays, the number of rays that are able to reproduce is decreased by the capture of these animals. The population is slow to recover from these losses due to the K-selected traits and as fishing continues the population of stingrays decreases at a faster rate than it increases.|$|R
50|$|Stevens innovated fly tying {{design by}} {{shortening}} streamers to extend only slightly beyond hooks, and by using longer hook shanks. She furthermore brought fly profiles closer {{to those of}} baitfish by tying materials parallel to the hook, and used fly shoulders to imitate bait fish <b>gill</b> <b>plates.</b> While patterns similar to the Grey Ghost existed prior to Stevens work, she pioneered the streamer by using new colors, structure, and less exotic materials, making it more effective and accessible. Her hooks were principally supplied by S. Allcock & Company Ltd. of Redditch, England, and her feathers supplied by George Fletcher of Rangeley, Maine.|$|R
50|$|Most {{members of}} this order, except for the family Balistidae, are ostraciiforms, meaning the body is rigid and {{incapable}} of lateral flexure. Because of this, they are slow-moving and rely on their pectoral, dorsal, anal, and caudal fins for propulsion rather than by body undulation. However, movement is usually quite precise; dorsal and anal fins aid in manoeuvring and stabilizing. In most species, all fins are simple, small, and rounded, except for the pelvic fins which, if present, are fused and buried. Again, in most members, the <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> are covered over with skin, the only gill opening a small slit above the pectoral fin.|$|R
50|$|P. managuensis is {{the most}} {{commonly}} traded species of its genus and is greatly valued among the aquarium trade.

40|$|A {{comparative}} {{study has been}} carried out of the oxidation of 5 -hydroxytryptamine and related compounds by the oxidase present in the <b>gill</b> <b>plates</b> of Mytilus edulis and of caeruloplasmin, the copper containing oxidase of mammalian plasma. Both preparations oxidized indole derivatives carrying a hydroxyl group in the 4 -, 5 -, 6 -, or 7 - position. The oxidation of bufoteni ne was compared with that of its 4 - and 6 -hydroxy analogues; the 4 -hydroxy analogue is psil ocine, a naturally occurring hallucinogenic compound. Bufotenine and the 6 -hydroxy analogue were oxidized by both preparations with the formation of brown pigments; psilocine was more rapidly oxidized with the appearance of a blue colour. 4 -Hydroxytryptamine and 7 -hydroxytryptamine were also oxidized, the former with the formation of a blue compound. The N- 1 -methyl derivatives of both bufotenine and psilocine were also oxidized. The Mytilus preparation acted also on 4 -, 5 -, and 7 -hydroxytryptophan and on 5 -hydroxyindole, none of which was oxidized by caeruloplasmin. The Mytilus enzyme also oxidized 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Paraphenylenediamine, a very good substrate of caeruloplasmin, was much more slowly oxidized by the <b>gill</b> <b>plate</b> enzyme. The evidence suggests that the two enzymes catalyse the same reactions, but that the substrate specificity of the mammalian oxidase is somewhat more restricted. Both enzymes are “hydroxyindole oxidases,” not specific for 5 -hydroxyindoles alone. Inhibitors of the Mytilus oxidase included inhibitors of copper enzymes but not edetate or carbon monoxide. The action of pig serum on 5 -hydroxytryptamine was due to caeruloplasmin and not to amine oxidase...|$|R
