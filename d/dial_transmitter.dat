5000|$|In 2001, {{the station}} would {{relocate}} from 980 AM to 620 AM, {{shortly after the}} original CKCK radio closed down. [...] The move gave CKRM access to the second-most powerful transmitting facility in Saskatchewan, {{and one of the}} largest coverage areas in North America. Due to its location on {{the lower end of the}} AM <b>dial,</b> <b>transmitter</b> power, and Saskatchewan's flat land (with near-perfect ground conductivity), CKRM now covered most of Saskatchewan's densely populated area, as well as parts of North Dakota and Montana. CJME, formerly at 1300 AM, took CKRM's former spot.|$|E
50|$|The station {{operates}} as a 50,000-watt clear-channel station. Due to its location {{near the bottom of}} the AM <b>dial,</b> <b>transmitter</b> power and Saskatchewan's flat land (with superb soil conductivity), CBK's daytime signal reaches most of the southern two-thirds of the province, including Regina, Saskatoon, Yorkton, Swift Current, Lloydminster, Moose Jaw and Prince Albert. It also provides grade B coverage as far west as Calgary and as far east as Winnipeg, and reaches across the border into North Dakota and Montana. At night, it can be heard across much of the western half of North America. However, it is strongest in western and central Canada, North Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho, and Minnesota.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a field-deployable diode-laser-based {{differential}} absorption lidar (DIAL) has been developed for lower-tropospheric water vapor observation in Tokyo, Japan. A photoacoustic cell is used for spectroscopy experiment around absorption peaks of 829. 022 nm and 829. 054 nm. The water vapor density extracted from the observational data agrees with the referenced radiosonde data. Furthermore, we applied modulated pulse technique for <b>DIAL</b> <b>transmitter.</b> It enables DIAL to measure water vapor profile for both low and high altitude regions...|$|E
50|$|Due to the station's low <b>dial</b> location, <b>transmitter</b> {{power and}} the {{surrounding}} area's flat land, it decently covers most of Kansas City and Topeka during the day.|$|R
50|$|A few {{peripherals}} {{that needed}} quicker response time, such as <b>Dial</b> Pulse <b>Transmitters,</b> were controlled via Central Pulse Distributors, which otherwise were mainly used for enabling (alerting) a peripheral circuit controller to accept {{orders from the}} Peripheral Unit Address Bus.|$|R
40|$|Differential {{absorption}} of laser radiation by various molecular species represents both a selective and a sensitive method of measuring specific atmospheric constituents. DIAL measurements {{can be carried}} out via two different means. Both involve using two laser pulses with slightly different wavelengths (lambda), (one lambda at a strong absorption line of the molecule of interest, the other detuned into the wing of the line), and comparing the attenuation of the pulses. One approach relies on scattering of the radiation from some conveniently located topographical target. In the other technique elastic scattering from atmospheric aerosols and particulates is used to return the radiation to the lidar receiver system. This case {{is referred to as the}} differential absorption and scattering technique, and is the technique we are interested in to measure water vapor at 940 nm. The 940 nm wavelength is extremely desirable to atmospheric scientist interested in accurate DIAL measurements of H 2 O in the upper and lower troposphere. Simulated measurements using approximately 940 nm and 815 nm lasers at a range of altitudes and experimental conditions are shown. By offering access to larger absorption cross-sections, injected seeded, 940 nm <b>DIAL</b> laser <b>transmitters</b> would allow for more accurate water profile measurements at altitudes from 6 to 16 km than is currently possible with 730 nm and 815 nm <b>DIAL</b> laser <b>transmitters.</b> We have demonstrated the operation of an injected seeded titanium-sapphire (TS) laser operating at approximately 940 nm with an energy of more than 90 mJ per pulse. The TS laser is pumped by a commercial, 600 mJ, 532 nm, 10 Hz Nd:YAG laser. The slope efficiency of the laser using a flat 50 percent R output coupler and a 10 m end-mirror is shown. The laser was injected seeded with a CW, AlGaAs, semiconductor diode laser which had an output of 83 mW. The CW diode seed beam was introduced into the TS laser cavity through a HR end-mirror. When the diode beam is aligned to the TS resonator, it controls the TS laser output wavelength and its spectral line width with the required resolution for DIAL applications. This work supports the need for the development of 940 nm, titanium-sapphire <b>DIAL</b> <b>transmitters...</b>|$|R
40|$|A tunable {{solid-state}} Raman shifted laser {{which was}} used in a water vapor Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) system at 9400 A is described. The <b>DIAL</b> <b>transmitter</b> {{is based on a}} tunable glass laser operating at 1. 06 microns, a hydrogen Raman cell to shift the radiation to 1. 88 microns, and a frequency doubling crystal. The results of measurements which characterize the output of the laser with respect to optimization of optical configuration and of Raman parameters were reported. The DIAL system was also described and preliminary atmospheric returns shown...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the investigation of}} a dual laser injection seeding and switching of an optical parametric oscillator. This option {{is part of a}} differential absorption lidar (<b>DIAL)</b> <b>transmitter</b> system for measuring environmental species at two wavelengths. For instance the realization was accomplished by using an injection seeded diode pumped Nd:YAG laser as pump for an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The purpose of these studies was an evaluation of different injection seeding techniques and their practical applicability. The suitable wavelengths were generated by injection seeding the OPO at the signal wavelength. Experiments with one and two external cavity diode lasers were performed to generate the required two idler wavelengths for the measurement. By this method line-narrowing occurs. A spectral width of the pulsed OPO of 200 MHz was achieved. Within the seeding and switching range at these two wavelengths inter-mode mixing was observed...|$|E
40|$|Wavelength {{accuracy}} and stability are key requirements for {{differential absorption lidar}} (DIAL). We present a control and timing design for the dual-stabilized cw master lasers in a pulsed master-oscillator power-amplifier configuration, which forms a robust low-cost water-vapor <b>DIAL</b> <b>transmitter</b> system. This design operates at 823 nm for water-vapor spectroscopy using Fabry–Perot-type laser diodes. However, the techniques described {{could be applied to}} other laser technologies at other wavelengths. The system can be extended with additional off-line or side-line wavelengths. The on-line master laser is locked to the center of a water absorption line, while the beat frequency between the on-line and the off-line is locked to 16 GHz using only a bandpass microwave filter and low-frequency electronics. Optical frequency stabilities of the order of 1 MHz are achieved. Alex Dinovitser, Murray W. Hamilton and Robert A. Vincen...|$|E
40|$|A new {{potential}} <b>DIAL</b> laser <b>transmitter</b> {{is described}} that uses solid-state dye laser materials {{to make a}} simpler, more compact, lower mass laser system. Two solid-state dye laser materials were tested to evaluate their performance in a laser oscillator cavity end pumped by a pulsed Nd:YAG laser at 532 nm. The polymer host polymethyl-methacrylate was injected with a pyrromethene laser dye, PM 580, or PM 597. A narrowband laser oscillator cavity was constructed to produce visible wavelengths of 578 and 600 nm which were frequency doubled into the UV region (299 or 300 nm) by using a BBO crystal, resulting in a maximum energy of 11 mJ at a wavelength of 578 nm when pumped by the Nd:YAG laser at an energy of 100 mJ (532 nm). A maximum output energy of 378 microJ was achieved in the UV region at a wavelength of 289 nm but lasted only 2000 laser shots at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The results are promising and show that a solid-state dye laser based ozone DIAL system is possible with improvements {{in the design of}} the laser transmitter...|$|R
50|$|The Gonset's {{receiver}} was manually tuned {{over the}} unit's frequency range with an analog <b>dial,</b> while the <b>transmitter</b> frequency {{was controlled by}} a crystal oscillator. The original model had a single jack on the front panel for an FT-243 style crystal. A chain of frequency multipliers allowed crystals in the 8 MHz range to be used. Many such crystals were available as military surplus in the 1950s. Later models had jacks for four crystals with a switch to select which one to use. Models were available for the 6 meter and 2 meter amateur bands, as well for as the VHF aircraft airband where they were often used as ground stations at smaller airfields. The civil defense model was painted yellow with CD insignia, and was available for the 6 and 2 meter bands. The 2 meter model was also used for the Civil Air Patrol, and could cover CAP frequencies which were adjacent to the 2 meter amateur band.|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{compact and}} rugged {{distributed}} feedback (DFB) laser {{system has been}} developed as online–offline injection seeder for the laser transmitter of a ground-based water vapor differential absorption lidar (WV DIAL) near 820 nm. The frequency stability of this injection seeder system shows {{a standard deviation of}} only 6. 3 MHz and a linewidth of less than 4. 6 MHz during continuous operation of more than 14 h. These values by far exceed the requirements for WV DIAL. By use of a novel technique based on an electro-optic deflector (EOD), alternating online–offline wavelength switching is achieved for each shot of the seeded laser with 250 Hz with a response time of less than 10 µs and very low crosstalk between the channels of only 33 dB. As a result, a spectral purity of 99. 95 % is reached by the WV <b>DIAL</b> <b>transmitter</b> which again fulfills the requirements for WV DIAL measurements with high accuracy. Because moveable parts are not present in the seeding system, this setup is significantly less sensitive to acoustic vibrations and ambient temperature drifts during field experiments than other seeding systems which use external cavity diode lasers (ECDL) and mechanical switches. By our new seeding system not only the requirements for ground-based water-vapor DIAL are met but also for space-borne WV DIAL applications that pose even higher demands to the frequency stability and spectral purity of the laser transmitters...|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} a double pulsed, {{injection}} seeded, 2 -micrometer compact coherent Differential absorption Lidar (<b>DIAL)</b> <b>transmitter</b> for CO 2 sensing is presented. This system is hardened for ground and airborne applications. The design architecture includes three continuous wave lasers which provide controlled on and off line seeding, injection seeded power oscillator and a single amplifier operating in double pass configuration. As the derivative a coherent Doppler wind lidar, this instrument has {{the added benefit of}} providing wind information. The active laser material used for this application is a Ho: Tm:YLF crystal operates at the eye-safe wavelength. The 3 -meter long folded ring resonator produces energy of 130 -mJ (90 / 40) with a temporal pulse length around 220 nanoseconds and 530 nanosecond pulses for on and off lines respectively. The separation between the two pulses is on the order of 200 microseconds. The line width is in the order of 2. 5 MHz and the beam quality has an M(sup 2) of 1. 1 times diffraction limited beam. A final output energy for a pair of both on and off pulses as high as 315 mJ (190 / 125) at a repetition rate of 10 Hz is achieved. The operating temperature is set around 20 C for the pump diode lasers and 10 C for the rod. Since the laser design has to meet high-energy as well as high beam quality requirements, close attention is paid to the laser head design to avoid thermal distortion in the rod. A side-pumped configuration is used and heat is removed uniformly by passing coolant through a tube slightly larger than the rod to reduce thermal gradient. This paper also discusses the advantage of using a long upper laser level life time laser crystal for DIAL application. In addition issues related to injection seeding with two different frequencies to achieve a transform limited line width will be presented...|$|E
