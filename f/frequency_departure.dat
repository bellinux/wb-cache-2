In the slave clock system, the PLL has been optimally de-signed so that the total phase-time variation in the whole network is significantly less than 10 ps. This phase-time variation is recommended by International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee (CCITT). The design method and PLL control algo-rithm enable both an optimum time constant of the PLL and a <b>frequency</b> <b>departure</b> of 10 - 12 in a holdover operation.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the National Airspace System Strategy Simulator is to provide the FAA with a {{decision}} support system to evaluate long-term infrastructure and regulatory strategies. The NAS strategy simulator consists of several modules representing the different entities within the NAS embedded in a system dynamics framework. The MIT Airline Scheduling Module is the module within the NAS Strategy Simulator that represents the decision making process of the airlines {{with respect to the}} schedules that they fly. The MIT Airline Scheduling Module is an incremental optimization tool to determine schedule changes from one time step to another that best meets demand using available resources. The optimization model combines an Integrated Schedule Design and Fleet Assignment model and a model, based on Passenger Decision Window model, that determines passenger preference for itineraries. We simultaneously establish <b>frequency,</b> <b>departure</b> times, fleet assignment, passenger loads and revenue within a competitive environment. Optimization methods often lead to extreme schedule decisions such as eliminating service to markets, often small markets, that are not financially profitable for the airlines. This is of grave concern to government policy makers as rural access to markets, goods and services is a politically charged subject. The issue is to understand what is likely to happen in small communities if the government doesn't respond in some way and how much subsidy, if any, would it be necessary to encourage airlines to maintain service in these markets. The approach we will use is based on economic policy and cost-benefit analysis. by Flora A. Garcia. Thesis (S.

40|$|The {{capability}} to predict two-phase flow behaviours in forced convective subcooled boiling flow is of considerable interest to {{boiling water reactor}} safety. Currently, the two-fluid model together with the interfacial area transport equation or population balance approach can potentially offer an advanced and accurate analysis of thermal-hydraulic characteristics for nuclear reactor systems. Furthermore, for applications to subcooled boiling conditions, several parameters such as nucleation number density, bubble departure size and bubble <b>departure</b> <b>frequency</b> are required as necessary boundary conditions to the models. The ebullition cycle, i. e., the reciprocal of the bubble <b>departure</b> <b>frequency,</b> consists of the bubble waiting and growth periods: bubble waiting period begins from {{the departure of the}} last bubble from the nucleation site and ends at the moment the current bubble radius reaches the wall cavity radius; and the bubble growth period lasts {{from the end of the}} bubble waiting period to the bubble departure. Data on bubble <b>departure</b> <b>frequency</b> are in abundance in literature for pool boiling. For forced convective subcooled boiling flow, bubble <b>departure</b> <b>frequency</b> data are, however, rather limited. Forced convective subcooled boiling experiments were conducted in a vertical-upward annular channel by using water as the testing fluid at atmosphere pressure. The test runs comprised of inlet temperatures, velocities and wall heat fluxes ranging from 80. 0 C to 98. 5 C, 0. 5 m/s to 1. 0 m/s and 62. 0 kW/m 2 to 205. 5 kW/m 2 respectively. A high-speed digital video camera was employed to capture the bubble <b>departure</b> <b>frequencies</b> for a total of 75 test conditions. Experimental observation showed that if the liquid subcooling was high, quenching occurred with the apparent bubble waiting period occupying a major part of the ebullition cycle. However, when the liquid subcooling was low, the waiting period was found to be negligible thereby yielding a high <b>departure</b> bubble <b>frequency.</b> Existing models/correlations on bubble waiting time, growth time, and <b>departure</b> <b>frequency</b> were reviewed and compared with the current experimental data and datasets available in literature.

For this study a new experimental setup was designed, constructed and commissioned to investigate bubble nucleation, growth, departure and interaction during nucleate pool boiling from a silicon device fully immersed in fluorinert FC- 72. The location of bubble nucleation is controlled by artificial cavities etched into the silicon substrate. Boiling is initiated with a heater integrated on the back and micro-sensors indicate the wall temperature at the bubble nucleation site. During this work three different silicon test section designs were fabricated and boiling experiments on these substrates successfully conducted. Bubble growth, bubble <b>departure</b> <b>frequencies</b> and bubble <b>departure</b> diameters for different dimensioned artificial cavities, varied pressure and increasing wall temperature were measured from high-speed imaging sequences. Bubble interactions like vertical and horizontal coalescence were visualised and their impact on the boiling heat transfer investigated.

In the paper it has been analysed the influence of: nozzle diameter and height of liquid over the nozzle on the chaotic character of bubble departures. The analysis has been conducted based on the numerical model of chaotic bubble departures proposed in the paper [3]. The following forces in the model of bubble growth have been considered: drag force, Boussinesq–Basset force, added-mass forces and {{the changes in the}} gas momentum. The influence of Boussinesq–Basset and added-mass forces on the <b>frequency</b> of bubble <b>departures</b> has been discussed. It has been shown that the intensity of appearance of the chaotic bubble departures is caused by increase in the nozzle diameter and height of liquid over the nozzle. The increase of the nozzle diameter causes the decrease of the bubble <b>departure</b> <b>frequency</b> and the depth of liquid penetration into the nozzle.

The A(− 6) promoter variant of AGT is associated with higher plasma angiotensinogen levels and increased risk of essential hypertension. The geographic distribution of the A(− 6) variant leads to the intriguing hypothesis that the G(− 6) promoter variant has been selectively advantageous outside Africa. To test these hypotheses, we investigated the roles of population history and natural selection in shaping patterns of genetic diversity in AGT, by sequencing the entire AGT gene (14, 400 bp) in 736 chromosomes from Africa, Asia, and Europe.
