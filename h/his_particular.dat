5|$|Popular {{demand for}} Greek New Testaments {{led to a}} flurry of further {{authorized}} and unauthorized editions in the early sixteenth century; almost {{all of which were}} based on Erasmus's work and incorporated <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> readings, although typically also making a number of minor changes of their own. Tregelles gives Acts 13:33 {{as an example of the}} places in which commonly received text did not follow Erasmian text (εν τω ψαλμω τω πρωτω → εν τω ψαλμω τω δευτερω).|$|E

In the past 20 or so years SGD have gained popularity amongst young children with speech deficiencies, such as autism, Down syndrome, and predicted brain damage due to surgery.|$|E
5|$|The French {{government}} installed Rainilaiarivony in the Geryville {{neighborhood of}} Algiers, {{one of the}} derelict parts of town. He was assigned a French attendant and guard named Joseph Vassé, who maintained detailed documentation on the personality and activities of Rainilaiarivony throughout his exile in French Algeria. Vassé described {{the former prime minister}} as a man of great spontaneity, sincere friendliness, and openness of heart, but also prone to mood swings, touchiness, and a tendency to be demanding, especially in regard to <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> tastes in clothing. His intelligence, tact and leadership qualities won him the admiration of many who knew him, including Le Myre des Vilers, who referred to him as both an enemy and a friend. Upon learning of Rainilaiarivony's living situation in Algiers, Le Myre de Vilers privately lobbied the French government for better accommodation. Consequently, Vassé found a new home for the former Prime Minister at the elegant estate called Villa des Fleurs ("Villa of the Flowers") in the upscale Mustapha Supérieur neighborhood, neighboring the residence of the exiled former king of Annam.|$|E

25|$|Most of Dolf’s {{scientific}} {{work has been}} devoted to land snails, especially those from subsaharan Africa and the islands surrounding this continent. Although there are few families on which he has not published, there are three families that may be considered <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> area of expertise and fascination: the pulmonate families Streptaxidae and Achatinidae and the operculate (caenogastropod) family Maizaniidae.|$|E
25|$|The general {{importance}} of Abelard lies in his having fixed more decisively than anyone before him the scholastic manner of philosophizing, with {{the object of}} giving a formal, rational expression to received ecclesiastical doctrine. Though <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> interpretations may have been condemned, they were conceived in essentially the same spirit as the general scheme of thought afterwards elaborated in the 13th century with approval from {{the heads of the}} Church.|$|E

25|$|Hoxton's public gardens were {{a popular}} resort from the overcrowded City streets, {{and it is}} reputed that the name of Pimlico came from the publican, Ben Pimlico, and <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> brew.

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Roman Republic, some leading Romans laid {{personal}} {{claims to}} Venus' favour. The general and dictator Sulla adopted Felix ("Lucky") as a surname, acknowledging his debt to heaven-sent good fortune and <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> debt to Venus Felix, for his extraordinarily fortunate political and military career. His protégé Pompey competed for Venus' support, dedicating (in 55 BC) a large temple to Venus Victrix as part of his lavishly appointed new theatre, and celebrating his triumph of 54 BC with coins that showed her crowned with triumphal laurels.|$|E
25|$|In medical theory, al-Razi relied {{mainly on}} Galen, but <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> {{attention}} to the individual case, stressing that each patient must be treated individually, and his emphasis on hygiene and diet reflect {{the ideas and concepts}} of the empirical hippocratic school. Rhazes considered the influence of the climate and the season on health and well-being, he took care that there was always clean air and an appropriate temperature in the patients' rooms, and recognized the value of prevention as well as the need for a careful diagnosis and prognosis.|$|E

25|$|The methodologies {{of liberal}} or {{progressive}} Islam {{rest on the}} interpretation and re-interpretation of traditional Islamic scripture (the Quran) and other texts (such as the Hadith), a process called ijtihad (see below). This can vary from the slight to the most liberal, where only {{the meaning of the}} Quran {{is considered to be a}} revelation, with its expression in words seen as the work of the prophet Muhammad in <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> time and context. As a consequence, liberal/progressive Muslims may then interpret verses from the Quran allegorically or even set them aside.|$|E
25|$|Forman soon {{established}} himself as a bright and enthusiastic MP. During his first three months in the House he asked 64 formal questions of Ministers in the Labour government. <b>His</b> <b>particular</b> areas of interest were nuclear power, incomes policy, education policy and ministerial patronage. After the Conservatives returned to government in 1979, it was widely expected that Forman would soon obtain ministerial office. He served as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) first to Lord Carrington in the Foreign Office and later to Douglas Hurd in the Home Office. However, promotion beyond that was slow in coming.|$|E
25|$|Wilson was {{primarily}} known for two lifelong projects.

Of those editions, the one of Hamlet was <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> focus, and he published a number of other books on the play, supporting the textual scholarship of his edition as well as offering an interpretation. His What Happens in Hamlet, first published in 1935, is among the more influential books ever written on the play, being reprinted several times including a revised second edition in 1959.|$|E

60|$|We {{remember}} the caveman. We remember {{him because he}} made his century imperishable. But, unhappily, we remember him dimly, in a collective sort of way, because he memorialized his century dimly, in a collective sort of way. He had no written speech, so he left us rude scratchings of beasts and things, cracked marrow-bones, and weapons of stone. It was the best expression {{of which he was}} capable. Had he scratched <b>his</b> own <b>particular</b> name with the scratchings of beasts and things, stamped his cracked marrowbones with <b>his</b> own <b>particular</b> seal, trade-marked <b>his</b> weapons of stone with <b>his</b> own <b>particular</b> device, that particular man would we remember. But he did the best he could, and we remember him as best we may.|$|R
25|$|Baird's {{numerous}} other developments demonstrated <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> talent at invention. He was a visionary {{and began to}} dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, {{but some of the}} original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.|$|E

Here he met with Joseph White, a former {{business}} associate and a Friend, who introduced him to Daniel French. Daniel French was an experienced mechanic who would design and construct steam engines to power a variety of equipment which he would also design and build. This equipment just happened to include a steamboat, named the Rebecca, which was currently operating as a ferry between Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey. Furthermore, French held a federal patent for <b>his</b> <b>particular</b> steamboat design which was propelled {{by one of his}} engines driving a stern paddlewheel.|$|E
