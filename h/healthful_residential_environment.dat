In this paper, an examination is made {{of the influence of}} childhood experiences and of <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> choices of family members outside the household. It is argued that socialisation, location-specific capital and the wish to maintain close family ties may result in living in a similar <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> later in life and in similar environments to siblings and parents. Results of multinomial logistic regression analyses of data from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study show that the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> during childhood is indeed strongly associated with the current <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> Moreover, individuals show a strong similarity to their parents and siblings in their <b>residential</b> <b>environment,</b> even after accounting for residential inertia and return migration. ...|$|R

How did the managers work in order to create and maintain a good physical <b>residential</b> <b>environment?</b> We had four themes, homelike environment on the accommodations, priorities on the accommodation, care/nursing in the physical <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> and the manager’s possibility to influence the physical <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> The study followed a qualitative method. Five managers were interviewed on four accommodations and the managers were said to work actively with the physical <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> The results of the study were analyzed on the basis of Antonovskys theoretical perspectives called ”the feeling of contexts”. The result showed that the managers considered that the living environment for people with dementia should be a homelike environment which is individual tailored from their previous life.

Demographic variables impacting QOL were also examined. The Wisconsin Quality of Life Index [...] -Canadian Version (CaW QLI, Diaz & Mercier, 1996) was administered to a total of 46 participants and was used to assess the QOL of individuals living in a supported <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> as compared to individuals living in other types of environments. The major findings were: (1) psychiatric consumers/survivors in the supported <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> reported higher QOL scores in 4 of the 9 domains examined; (2) residents living in a supported housing facility {{were more likely to be}} involved in a greater number of daily activities; (3) education was strongly correlated with 4 of the 9 QOL domains; (4) regression analyses however showed that <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> or demographic variables on their own did not have a significant effect on QOL.

40|$|This paper aims {{to clarify}} how the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> is {{associated}} with overall health-related quality of life (QOL) via active travel (walking and cycling), by reflecting the influence of different trip purposes in Japan. The health-related QOL includes physical, mental, and social dimensions. For this study we implemented a questionnaire survey in 20 cities in Japan in 2010 and obtained valid answers from 1202 respondents. The <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> is {{defined in terms of}} distances to and densities of different daily facilities extracted from both the survey and external GIS data. We found that the effects of <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> on active travel behavior are mixed and limited, depending on types of trip makers. Unexpectedly, travel behavior has no direct effects on the health-related QOL. The <b>residential</b> <b>environment,</b> which is only observed indirectly via lifestyle habits for commuters, has limited effects on health. As for noncommuters, neither their travel behavior nor the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> influences their health-related QOL...|$|R

This paper addresses {{the question about the}} extent to which these variations in house prices can be explained by differences in physical, social and functional characteristics of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> Data on the prices and characteristics of houses were linked with a variety of attributes of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> We used hedonic price modelling to derive different models of property prices from which the contribution of the characteristics of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> were estimated. It is demonstrated that regional house price variations can indeed largely be explained by characteristics of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> An important factor in these regional price differences is the accessibility to employment opportunities.

40|$|Workshop 2. Session 2. 3 : Mapping home Abstract Housing {{satisfaction}} {{is more and}} more being determined by the quality of the surrounding area, and its appreciation by the inhabitants. Housing is more than the care for just a roof for everybody: the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> matters. Otherwise, there are processes of individualization, globalization and information which make people more footloose, building their own networks independent from the location their home is coincidentally situated. The neighbourhood is a space and a place at the same time, with a meaning for the residents. Everyone lives somewhere, in a house, a surrounding <b>residential</b> <b>environment,</b> located in a neighbourhood {{as a part of the}} town. Scientists, planners and politicians all pay attention to the quality of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> However, in most studies and reports there is not much attention for the concept of both the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> and the neighbourhood. Some just consider the other side of the street or the surrounding block, a couple of houses. Others are analyzing data or making plans for areas of thousands of dwellings. Both are planning for or doing research on what they call the neighbourhood. This paper focuses on the concept itself of neighbourhood and <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> The paper goes into the next questions: - What do people consider as their own <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> and as their neighbourhood? What are differences? We have measured this in a pilot study in two Dutch cities, using a mental mapping method. - How are neighbourhoods analysed and classified by both administrations as scientists. We have combined all types of classifications and distinguished into six typologies, six ways of looking to neighbourhoods and <b>residential</b> <b>environments.</b> These typologies are dependent on the aim and the viewpoint of the classifier, so the researcher, the planner or the politician. - Do these top down classifications and bottom up considerations match. And what are consequences if they do not? We will show that the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> as perceived by the inhabitants, and as used by the administration often do not match. At last, we go into conclusions for scientists, planners and politicians when they are working with data or plans concerning neighbourhoods or <b>residential</b> <b>environments...</b>|$|R

40|$|Dutch {{rural areas}} have {{changed into a}} post-modern {{countryside}} and have become marketable commodities. The demand for rural space and rural amenities has increased, with concomitant tensions on the rural housing market, tensions which are enhanced by the restrictive spatial policy in Dutch rural areas. The demand for rural <b>residential</b> <b>environments</b> appears to be large. This paper reports {{the results of our}} research into the preferences of urban households for living in a rural <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> These preferences will be linked with images and representations of the countryside. It is assumed that individual images of the countryside (whether idyllic or not) affect residential preferences and these preferences have, in turn, their effect on migration behaviour. Empirical evidence suggests that perceptions, preferences and behaviour pertaining to rural <b>residential</b> <b>environments</b> are indeed interrelated. The Dutch countryside commands a very positive image and the demand for <b>residential</b> <b>environments</b> with rural characteristics is considerable. Consequently, a rural idyll can be identified in the Netherlands...|$|R

40|$|Lighting consumes between about 29 - 35 % of {{the energy}} used within {{commercial}} office space while lighting only consumes about 11 % {{of the energy}} used in a <b>residential</b> <b>environment.</b> Through conscientious design of the lighting systems, the lighting load can be reduced {{by more than half}} within both environments. These estimates can vary significantly as a consequence that buildings vary significantly in shape and size as well as functions. Additionally, the more inefficient a building is, the greater the potential to accrue savings. While the absolute energy required to light a space, whether in an office or <b>residential</b> <b>environment,</b> is the same, the percentile difference in energy loads occur as a result of different energy demands between office and <b>residential</b> <b>environments.</b> Office environments operate very differently to <b>residential</b> <b>environments.</b> Offices have a very high level of occupancy during office hours and are then largely unoccupied, while residential buildings have highly sporadic occupancy levels throughout the year.

This is a useful approach for identifying the most deprived areas, and summary indices are good predictors of mortality and morbidity, but it remains unclear which aspects of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> are most salient for health.

This paper focuses on whether associations with neighbourhood characteristics are different for men and women. The sociopolitical and physical environment, amenities, and indicators of economic deprivation and affluence were measured in neighbourhoods in the UK, and their relationship with self-rated health was investigated using multilevel regression models. Each of these contextual domains was associated with self-rated health over and above individual socioeconomic characteristics. The magnitude of the association was larger for women in each case. Statistically significant interactions between gender and <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> were found for trust, integration into wider society, left-wing political climate, physical quality of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment,</b> and unemployment rate.

40|$|Purpose:The inter-relationships between {{objective}} (census based) {{and subjective}} (resident reported) {{measures of the}} <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> is understudied in African American (AA) populations. Methods: Using data from the Life Influences on Fetal Environments Study (2009 – 2011; n = 1387) of AA women, we quantified the area-level variation in subjective reports of residential healthy food availability, walkability, safety, and disorder that can be accounted for with an objective neighborhood disadvantage index (NDI). Two-level generalized linear models estimated associations between objective and subjective measures of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment,</b> accounting for individual-level covariates. Results: In unconditional models, intraclass correlation coefficients for block-group variance in subjective reports ranged from 11 % (healthy food availability) to 30 % (safety). Models accounting for the NDI (vs. both NDI and individual-level covariates) accounted for more variance in healthy food availability (23 % vs. 8 %) and social disorder (40 % vs. 38 %). The NDI and individual-level variables accounted for 39 % and 51 % of the area-level variation in walkability and safety, respectively. Associations between subjective and objective measures of the <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> were significant and in the expected direction. Conclusions: Future studies on neighborhood effects on health, especially among AAs, should include {{a wide range of}} <b>residential</b> <b>environment</b> measures, including subjective, objective, and spatial contextual variables...|$|R
