5|$|In a flashback, {{after losing}} his mother, Gopal, in his sorrow had been {{wandering}} aimlessly at Singapore. In a nightclub, he meets a singer named Chitra. He gets {{attracted to her}} and they decide to marry, {{in the presence of}} Chitra's brother Raju. But he is disappointed— from the very first day of their marriage, she comes home inebriated, and despite his repeated requests, has little respect for tradition and family values. Eventually, Gopal's father dies of a heart attack after seeing Chitra's drunken behaviour on Gopal's birthday. Gopal tries to control Chitra, but she is always irritated by his acts. At one point, she tries to leave him. Gopal begs her to change her decision, but Chitra still leaves. The next day, he hears that Chitra had died on a railway track, and this hurts <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> Latha sympathises with Gopal and accepts his love.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} Reitz {{found it hard}} to make a living, as competition among lawyers in Cape Town was quite severe at this time. Nevertheless, he succeeded in making a name for himself, due to his sharp legal mind and his social intelligence. Being part of the western Circuit Court of the Cape Colony gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of experience in a very short time. At the same time, Reitz nurtured his political interests by writing lead articles for the Cape Argus newspaper, for which he also reported on the proceedings of the Cape Parliament and acted as deputy editor. In 1870 Reitz moved his legal practice to Bloemfontein in the Orange Free State. The discovery of diamonds {{on the banks of the}} Vaal River, Reitz thought, would lead to a growth of legal work and enable him to set up a thriving practice. This was not to be, however, and after a few months Reitz left Bloemfontein to set up as a diamond prospector in Griqualand West, where he bought a small claim near Pniel from the Berlin Missionary Society. This enterprise also proved unsuccessful, and again after only a few months Reitz returned to Cape Town. This time, his Cape Town law practice was successful, ironically because of the British annexation of the Orange Free State diamondfields (1871) and the economic prosperity this emanated for the Cape Colony.|$|E

25|$|The hard hitting {{ability and}} match winning {{performances}} in the Zimbabwe series gained <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of attraction to include him to the Twenty20 International series against Sri Lanka in July 2015. But he showed poor performance in the 2-match series, where he got out in both matches below 10 runs. However, Pakistan won the two matches and won the series.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 Bonatti was {{assigned}} to the Alpine regiment and for four days each week he trained men to climb; for the other three he was allowed to head off into the mountains on his own.

25|$|Tony's second {{marriage}} {{was not a}} happy one and Hannah soon lost all tolerance for her fun-loving husband. She began to look down upon his less than lucrative job as a carpenter and his inability to provide {{for her and her}} children. They separated in 1985, after which Tony bought a house in disuse at Number 3 Albert Square and set about making it habitable, leaving Hannah to move in with another man. Kelvin soon joined Tony on the square, although it took <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to persuade his wife to allow him custody of their son.|$|E
25|$|In Nanterre, Cohn-Bendit was {{a leader}} in claims for more sexual freedom, with actions such as {{participating}} in the occupation of the girls' premises, interrupting the speech of a minister who was inaugurating a swimming pool in order to demand free access to the girls' dormitory. This contributed to attracting to <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of student supporters later {{to be called the}} '22 March Movement', a group characterised by a mixture of Marxist, sexual and anarchist ideology. In the autumn of 1967 rumours of his upcoming expulsion from the university led to a local students' strike, and his expulsion was cancelled. On 22 March 1968 students occupied the administrative offices, and the closing of the university on 2 May helped move the protests to downtown Paris.|$|E

25|$|Daei {{became the}} first Asian player to feature in a UEFA Champions League match. Yet at Bayern he found himself low in the pecking order. This coupled with the Iranian {{national}} team's scheduling, Daei had found very little time for playing. Daei was unhappy with his position in the club and {{decided to make a}} move to Hertha BSC before the end of his three-year contract, when Bayern won the championship title in the 1999 Bundesliga. He scored his first and second goal in the UEFA Champions League on 22 September 1999 in group stage match against Chelsea won by Hertha with 2–1. His famous match against Chelsea gained <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of recognition. Yet even at Hertha he was not a hugely important player, since he was only amongst one of the squad's many successful players, who were to fulfill Hertha's Bundesliga and UEFA Champions League dreams.|$|E
25|$|It was Neil's {{last season}} {{and it was a}} shame that his amazing career should end in an uncharacteristic {{outburst}} of bad temper against Ted Dexter. I never did {{get to the bottom of}} the row but perhaps it was just because he and Ted were total opposites as people. All I know is that his press comments on Ted lost <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of friends. These attacks upset the MCC players more than anything else that happened on that tour, and for Neil to retire from the game on this sour note was disappointing for those who had played with an against him, and for the public who had enjoyed his performances. For all this, you couldn't help admiring some of Neil's knocks, including his sixth Test century against England. He was nearly always exciting to watch because he was the sort of batsman who was supremely capable of winning or saving a match. He was also good to bowl to because he gave you a chance; he played shots and he took risks. And his fielding was quite brilliant; in this series, it was easily the best on either side. He stopped some wonderful shots in the covers and took some terrific catches. It was just sad to see such a talented man consumed by such bitterness.|$|E

But in retrospect, it really amounted to nothing. It wasn't a big-time bidding war. Probably the most determining thing was Adidas wasn't going to offer <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money. It {{was the first time}} that the athlete was going to share in the royalties of the shoe. That was the gamble." ...|$|E

500|$|On Inflikted, Max was the group's {{songwriter}} and lyricist. At {{the time}} of the album recording, he was watching the same four movies almost every day: Apocalypse Now, City of God, A Clockwork Orange, and La Haine. Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted to do something different, and it gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of ideas. He said, [...] "What came out of this album was more than enough to fill the void of not working together for so long. It's pretty intense. From the first moment, it's war." ...|$|E
500|$|During Microsoft's early history, Gates was {{an active}} {{software}} developer, particularly in the company's programming language products, but his basic role {{in most of the}} company's history was primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100, but as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's products. He remained interested in technical details; in 1985, Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft Excel, [...] "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program, not because it's going to make <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of money (although I'm sure it will do that), but because it's a neat hack." ...|$|E
500|$|Renwick {{has stated}} that the {{production}} of any further Jonathan Creek specials will depend on reception to [...] "The Grinning Man", {{as well as his}} own schedule. Davies is amenable to reprising the lead role in future, stating: [...] "If David writes more, I'm happy to do them. Unless they turned up and they were awful - but it hasn't happened so far. And he wouldn't send me an awful one anyway. But I don't know if he will come up with another one. He always says that the writing is so difficult, I'm not sure it gives him any pleasure. But I think the shooting gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of pleasure this time. He was directing {{for the first time and}} I think he really enjoyed it. So, we'll see." ...|$|E
50|$|Knight was a {{far more}} successful, and {{certainly}} regular, one-day player for England.

500|$|Despite his defeat, American Pharoah {{was moved}} up to Grade I class for the Del Mar Futurity over seven furlongs on September 3. He was ridden by Victor Espinoza {{for the first time}} and started as the 3.2–1 second {{favorite}} behind Best Pal Stakes winner Skyway, with Calculator and Iron Fist also in the field. American Pharoah took the lead from the start and went clear in the straight to win by four and three quarter lengths from Calculator, with a gap of more than eight lengths back to Iron Fist in third. Commenting on the colt's improvement, Baffert said, [...] "We took the blinkers off, put cotton in his ears and schooled <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot.</b> He trained well, we decided he was ready and we put him in there. Today, he behaved himself and showed what he could do. He did what we thought he'd do the first time." ...|$|E
