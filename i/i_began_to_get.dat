2500|$|Jed's death deeply {{affected}} Kesey, {{who later}} called Jed {{a victim of}} policies that had starved the team of funding. [...] He wrote to Senator Mark Hatfield, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> mad, Senator. I had finally found where the blame must be laid: that the money we are spending for national defense is not defending us from the villains real and near, the awful villains of ignorance, and cancer, and heart disease and highway death. How many school buses could be outfitted with seatbelts with the money spent {{for one of those}} 16-inch shells?" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{three o'clock}} <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> tired. My hands hurt. And I {{concluded}} I had been rather unlucky {{to start on}} a broadbill at the very beginning.|$|E
60|$|Now it was <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{a glimmer}} of light through my head; my tired limbs ceased to tremble, and my heart beat less furiously as I set about aiding Pierre force Horry Sims up the rude ladder.|$|E
6000|$|... "'No,' he answered, 'I carn't. It's a rum thing, but {{whichever}} I am, sure as fate, 'bout {{the end of}} a month <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> sick o' myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tea---- Now we're so {{near your}} Gilsons, <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> scared. Wouldn't {{know what to}} do. Gee, I've heard you have to balance a tea-cup and a {{sandwich}} and a hunk o' cake {{and a lot of}} conversation all at once! I'd spill the tea, and drop crumbs, and probably have the butler set on me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't I know that?" [...] Dredlinton exclaimed angrily. [...] "Don't I get a dozen {{threatening}} letters a day? Men take me on {{one side}} and reason with me in the club. I had a Cabinet Minister at the office this afternoon. <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the cold shoulder wherever I turn, but, damn it all, don't you understand that we must have money?" ...|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile I {{had become}} {{sufficiently}} awake {{to take a}} mild interest in the matter. I rose and looked out. As I saw a long, black, lean creature muzzling at something on the ground, <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> excited myself.|$|E
60|$|Perhaps {{a menace}} of publicity, rather than risk, {{was the cause}} of the wearing strain on him. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a closer insight into Sampson, {{and in the absence of}} any {{conclusive}} evidence of his personal baseness I felt pity for him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{interested}} in the old dame who talked to me so freely. She was small and weak-looking, and appeared very thin in her limp, old, faded gown; she had a meek, patient expression on her face, and her voice, too, like her face, expressed weariness and resignation.|$|E
60|$|May 26.--I {{went the}} same dull and weary round {{out to the}} Parliament House, which bothers one's brains for the day. Nevertheless, I get on. Pages vanish from under my hand, and {{find their way to}} J. Ballantyne, who is {{grinding}} away with his presses. I think I may say, now <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the dust raised about me by so many puzzling little facts, that it is plain sailing to the end.|$|R
60|$|I {{was glad}} to see them finish, 'cause <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a bit nervous about the coin, but he paid up right enough, and giv me a ha'penny for myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "You doggone wild-hoss wrangler!" [...] he ejaculated, with {{starting}} {{eyes and}} healthy grin. [...] "Shore <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> your hunch. Honest, I never till this heah minnit thought so damn {{much of your}} idee. You shore gotta excuse me. A blind man could figger this deal heah.... Big corrals hid behind the gate under us--long fence out there to the wash--close up any holes {{on this side of}} valley--then make a humdinger of a drive.... Cowboy, shore's you're born I'm seein' my Arizona ranch right this minnit!" ...|$|R
60|$|When {{we were at}} the job a {{good many}} Kanakas used to put in the best of the day looking on, and once that nigger turned up. He stood back with the natives and laughed and did the big don and the funny dog till <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> riled.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{promised the}} both of you to give you an answer to-day. I've been {{thinking}} and thinking and thinking, till <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> angry with you both for plaguing me so; and even now I don't seem any nearer than ever I was to making up my mind.' Eric said suddenly: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I was thinking,' said Rose shyly; 'they made me {{put into}} the Post Office Savings Bank after <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a salary. I have five-and-twenty pounds there that I could get out {{in a couple of}} days, and I should be so glad to help to bring that dear little boy home.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Myra," [...] Nat said, [...] "we will {{investigate}} {{the contents of}} the basket. <b>I</b> am <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as hungry as a hunter, and I am sure that you must be so too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Two weeks afterward, when <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> around again, {{the doctor}} {{laughed and said}} he was sure that my friend's keeping me mad all the time did more than his drugs to cure me.|$|R
60|$|As {{time went}} on, <b>I</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> pretty {{fed up with}} young Andy. He was making a fortune as fast as any feller could out of the sudden boom in the supper-custom, and he knowing {{perfectly}} well that if it hadn't of been for Katie there wouldn't of been any supper-custom at all; and you'd of thought that anyone claiming {{to be a human}} being would have had the gratitood to forgive and forget and go over and say a civil word to Katie when she come in. But no, he just hung round looking black at all of them; and one night he goes and fairly does it.|$|R
60|$|We got out our {{basket and}} made tea. In all moments of doubt, your Englishwoman makes tea. As Hilda said, she will boil her Etna on Vesuvius. We waited and drank our tea; we drank our tea and waited. A full hour passed away. Ram Das never came back. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> frightened.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> irritated. Julia, I remembered, {{had been}} cashier {{in a city}} restaurant, and had, when I {{was little more than}} a boy, almost inveigled me into an engagement. I found myself getting hot at the {{recollection}} of the spooney rhapsodies I had hoarsely poured into her powder-streaked ear while holding her flabby hand across the counter.|$|E
6000|$|All {{that day}} and all {{the days of the}} week which {{followed}} they played with the same singular insect-like absorption and at last <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some notion of their horror. They refused to enter the yard. [...] "I don't want to see it," [...] Mary Isabel wailed. Then she asked, [...] "Will it ever be home for us again?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Flora smiled, {{a rather}} {{thoughtful}} smile. [...] "Not in a way. I've good grounds for being satisfied; but <b>I</b> had <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> disturbed about Harry. He works too hard. No doubt he's forced to bother about his business, {{but he looked}} thin and was sometimes moody." ...|$|R
60|$|Alas, <b>I</b> {{was just}} <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> eloquent, and {{there goes the}} lunch bell, and after lunch I must make up the mail.|$|R
60|$|But I've wandered {{a little}} off the track of my tale; I'll get back on my course again. Now you {{see what kind of}} speed I was making. So, as I said, when I had been tearing along this way about thirty years <b>I</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> uneasy. Oh, it was {{pleasant}} enough, with a good deal to find out, but then it was kind of lonesome, you know. Besides, I wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> somewhere. I hadn't shipped with the idea of cruising forever. First off, I liked the delay, because I judged I was going to fetch up in pretty warm quarters when I got through; but towards the last <b>I</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> feel that I'd rather go to--well, most any place, so as to finish up the uncertainty.|$|R
60|$|While {{tramping}} {{around in}} the neighborhood of Furnace Creek I happened upon an old almost obliterated trail. It led toward the ridges of clay, and when I had climbed it a little ways <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an impression that the slopes on the other side must run down into a basin or canyon. So I climbed to the top.|$|E
60|$|Fresh complications, then! Had the Duke {{come to see}} me off, or had {{his suspicions}} been aroused? Was he even now insisting upon an {{explanation}} with Lord Cheisford? The minutes passed, and <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> restless and anxious. Then the door opened, and Lord Chelsford entered alone. He came over at once to my side. He was looking perplexed and a little annoyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Most of what {{followed}} {{seems like a}} nightmare still. I see it in my dreams sometimes.... I'll hurry over that part. Mr. Danvers had told me to watch out. He might have been shadowed from New York, but he didn't think so. At first I had no suspicions, but on the boat to Holyhead <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> uneasy. There was one {{woman who had been}} very keen to look after me, and chum up with me generally--a Mrs. Vandemeyer. At first I'd been only grateful to her for being so kind to me; but all the time I felt there was something about her I didn't like, and on the Irish boat I saw her talking to some queer-looking men, and from the way they looked I saw that they were talking about me. I remembered that she'd been quite near me on the Lusitania when Mr. Danvers gave me the packet, and before that she'd tried to talk to him once or twice. <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> scared, but I didn't quite see what to do.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am worse, Pa. I make so many {{calculations}} {{how much}} a year I must have when I marry, {{and what is the}} least I can manage to do with, that <b>I</b> am <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> wrinkles over my nose. Did you notice any wrinkles over my nose this evening, Pa?' ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{surprised}} at Angela. Odd how you never realize that every girl is at heart a vicious specimen until something goes wrong with her love affair. This cousin and I had been meeting freely since the days when I wore sailor suits and she hadn't any front teeth, yet only now was <b>I</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on <b>to</b> her hidden depths. A simple, jolly, kindly young pimple she had always struck me as--the sort you could more or less rely on not to hurt a fly. But here she was now laughing heartlessly--at least, I seemed to remember hearing her laugh heartlessly--like something cold and callous out of a sophisticated talkie, and fairly spitting on {{her hands in her}} determination to bring Tuppy's grey hairs in sorrow to the grave.|$|R
60|$|When I {{struck the}} town I see there warn't nobody {{out in the}} storm, so I never hunted for no back streets, but humped it {{straight}} through the main one; and when <b>I</b> <b>begun</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> towards our house I aimed my eye and set it. No light there; the house all dark--which made me feel sorry and disappointed, I didn't know why. But at last, just as I was sailing by, FLASH comes the light in Mary Jane's window! and my heart swelled up sudden, like to bust; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark, and wasn't {{ever going to be}} before me no more in this world. She WAS the best girl I ever see, and had the most sand.|$|R
60|$|Fortunately, Spot kept to an easy {{swinging}} lope, {{which was}} the most comfortable motion for me. But <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> numb, and could hardly stick on the saddle. Almost before I had dared to hope, Spot stopped. Uncovering my face, I saw Jim {{in the doorway of}} the lee side of the cabin. The yellow, streaky, whistling clouds of sand split on the cabin and passed on, leaving a small, dusty space of light.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} and waited. I waited a long, long time, and then I {{got up and walked}} up and down. In about an hour <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> anxious. It was more than time for Rectus to return. The walk {{to the end of the}} island and back was not much over a mile--at least, I {{supposed}} it was not. Could anything have happened to the boy? It was not yet sunset, and I couldn't imagine what there was to happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "We now {{came upon}} the {{territory}} of the Amt Neustadt; and here the Amtsrath Klausius, who has the Amt in farm, was in waiting on the boundary, and let his Majesty drive past. But as <b>I</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> tired of the speaking, and his Majesty went on always asking about villages, which stand hereabouts in great quantity, and I had always to name the owner, and say what sons he had in the Army,--I brought up Herr Amtsrath Klausius to the carriage, and said:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{mean that}} I'm tired of boxing," [...] Sheen hastened to explain. [...] "After {{all the trouble}} you've taken with me, {{it would be a}} bit thick if I chucked it just as <b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on. It isn't that. But you know how keen I was on boxing for the house?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not saying}} what I'd do," [...] <b>I</b> {{answered}} stiffly, <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a little angry myself. [...] "I'm asking what you'd do, without weapons of any sort?" ...|$|R
60|$|In the fourth, Ursula Bart (<b>I</b> was <b>beginning</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{anxious about}} her) turns up again. She is {{staying at the}} useful Lady Mary's place in Yorkshire. She meets Basil by {{accident}} one morning while riding alone. That is the advantage of having an American girl for your heroine. Like the British army: it goes anywhere and does anything.|$|R
