5|$|In {{the poem}} Alvíssmál, Thor tricks a dwarf, Alvíss, to his doom upon finding that {{he seeks to}} wed his {{daughter}} (unnamed, possibly Þrúðr). As the poem starts, Thor meets a dwarf who talks about getting married. Thor finds the dwarf repulsive and, apparently, realizes that the bride is his daughter. Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone, and that the dwarf must seek his consent. To do so, Thor says, Alvíss must tell him what <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{about all of the}} worlds that the dwarf has visited. In a long question and answer session, Alvíss does exactly that; he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world, and gives an amount of cosmological lore.|$|E

25|$|The Candy Tangerine Man: The film {{opens with}} pageantry pimp Baron (John Daniels) driving his {{customised}} two-tone {{red and yellow}} Rolls Royce around downtown L.A at night. His ladies have been coming up short lately and <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why. It turns out that two L.A.P.D. cops - Dempsey and Gordon, who have been after Baron for some time now, have resorted to rousting his girls every chance they get. Indeed, in the next scene they have set Baron up with a cop in drag to entrap him with procurement of prostitutes.|$|E
60|$|As Johnny murmured {{something}} in his placid admiration, the ministering women at his bed's head {{asked him what he}} said. It seemed that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether all these were brothers and sisters of his? So they told him yes. It seemed then, that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether God had brought them all together there? So they told him yes again. They made out then, that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether they would all get out of pain? So they answered yes to that question likewise, and made him understand that the reply included himself.|$|R

500|$|Bob Bowman {{took over}} as head coach of Michigan for the 2004–05 season. [...] He put Tarwater on a new {{training}} program, with a greater focus on speed training and less on distance. [...] "We've also put him through weight training, and I think it's been improving his speed", Bowman said. [...] "He {{has a very strong}} work ethic and always wants to improve. Instead of just getting in the pool and doing what we tell him to do, he actually thinks about it and asks questions. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the theory behind what he's doing." [...] Tarwater won the 2005 NCAA championship in the 200-yard butterfly. [...] His time of 1:42.30 was a Michigan and Big Ten record, and the third fastest time in NCAA history. In the 100-meter butterfly, he placed fourth.|$|E
500|$|The poem centres on {{humanity}} and human nature. When the poet sees the figures, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> {{their names and}} laments his ignorance. Eventually, he realizes that they are representative of Love, Ambition, and Poetry. While he longs, he fears {{they are out of}} reach and therefore tries to reject them. He argues that love is what he needs least and dismisses it by questioning what [...] "love" [...] actually means ("What is Love? and where is it?"). He rejects ambition, but it requires more work ("And for that poor Ambition—it springs / From a man's little heart's short fever-fit;"). Unlike the personas of Love and Ambition, the narrator is unable to find a reason to banish Poesy (Poetry), which reflects the poets' inner conflict: should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living? Keats's sought to write great poetry but feared his pursuit of literary prominence was based on a delusional view of his own merit as a poet. Further, he was incapable of completing his epic, [...] "Hyperion". As Walter Jackson Bate explains, to Keats [...] "Neither a finished 'grand Poem' nor even the semblance of a modest financial return seemed nearer." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{obtained}} {{his degree}} at the University of Manchester in 1978 and his DPhil in chemical physics at the University of Oxford. He worked as a professor for the University of Reading and left academia to work for Shell International Petroleum. After several years he opened his own training and consultancy business. He calls himself a [...] "science communicator" [...] and publishes a science book approximately every 18 months. He selects the topics for his books by writing about things <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> more about. The advent of the Internet makes {{it much easier to}} do research than back when he first started writing books in the early 1990s.|$|E

2500|$|Orr has a {{bucktoothed}} {{smile and}} frequently puts crabapples or horse chestnuts in {{his cheeks and}} rubber balls in his hands. He constantly teases Yossarian asking him if <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> why, to which Yossarian invariably says [...] "yes". Orr never gives any straightforward explanation for this other than he wants big cheeks and to detract from the peculiarity of this he keeps rubber balls in his hands. As he explains the latter, [...] "Every time someone asked me why I was walking around with crab apples in my cheeks, I'd just open my hands and show them it was rubber balls I was walking around with, not crab apples, {{and that they were}} in my hands, not my cheeks. It was a good story. But I never knew if it got across or not, since it's pretty tough to make people understand you when you're talking to them with two crab apples in your cheeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} {{prevalent}} symbols in Our Mutual Friend {{is that of the}} River Thames, and the river is linked to major themes of the novel, rebirth and renewal. Water is seen as a sign of new life, and associated by the Christian Church with the sacrament of Baptism. Characters like John Harmon and Eugene Wrayburn end up in the waters of the river, and come out reborn as new men. Wrayburn emerges from the river on his deathbed, but is ready to marry Lizzie to save her reputation. [...] He surprises everyone, including himself, when he survives and goes on to have a loving marriage with Lizzie. John Harmon also appears to end up in the river through no fault of his own, and when Gaffer pulls his [...] "body" [...] out of the waters, he adopts the alias of John Rokesmith. This alias is for his own safety and peace of mind; <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that he can do things on his own, and does not need his father's name or money to make a good life for himself.|$|E
