5|$|Like {{the modern}} pygmy hippopotamus, the Malagasy pygmy hippo has <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of}} its head rather than high orbits and teeth {{similar to those of}} the pygmy hippopotamus. The Malagasy pygmy hippo is {{similarly}} less aquatic, with many of its fossils found in the forested highlands of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Most birds cannot {{move their}} eyes, {{although}} there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, {{but it is not}} spiral as in mammals.|$|E

5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna {{takes the form of}} the beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a transsexual deity.|$|E

5|$|Crickets {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies. The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind {{these are two}} large compound <b>eyes.</b> <b>On</b> the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes). The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotinized. It is smooth and has neither dorsal or lateral keels (ridges).|$|E
5|$|Many {{bivalves}} have no eyes, but a {{few members}} of the Arcoidea, Limopsoidea, Mytiloidea, Anomioidea, Ostreoidea, and Limoidea have simple <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the margin of the mantle. These consist of a pit of photosensory cells and a lens. Scallops have more complex eyes with a lens, a two-layered retina, and a concave mirror. All bivalves have light-sensitive cells that can detect a shadow falling over the animal.|$|E
5|$|Mecoptera {{are small}} to {{medium-sized}} insects with long beaklike rostra, membranous wings and slender, elongated bodies. They have relatively simple mouthparts, {{with a long}} labium, long mandibles and fleshy palps, which resemble those of the more primitive true flies. Like many other insects, they possess compound <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the sides of their heads, and three ocelli on the top. The antennae are filiform (thread-shaped) and contain multiple segments.|$|E

The sight projected crosshairs into space so they were in focused at infinity, allowing the user to focus their <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the target and not have to change focus to see the line.|$|E
5|$|A made-for-television movie, Farewell to Manzanar, {{directed}} by John Korty, aired on March 11, 1976, on NBC. It {{was based on}} the 1973 memoir of the same name, written by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, who was incarcerated at Manzanar as a child, and her husband James D. Houston. The book and the movie {{tell the story of the}} Wakatsuki family and their experiences behind the barbed wire through young Jeanne's <b>eyes.</b> <b>On</b> October 7, 2011, the Japanese American National Museum (JANM) announced that they had negotiated the rights to the movie, and that they would make it available for purchase on DVD.|$|E
5|$|A week later, Kratos {{arrives at}} the island of Delos and explores the ruined statue of Apollo. He is {{attacked}} by all three Furies and is eventually captured. Orkos appears and frees Kratos, transporting him to another location. Orkos gives Kratos his Oath Stone and reveals that he and Aletheia tried to warn Zeus of Ares' and the Furies' plan. In retaliation, they took the Oracle's eyes, the objects Kratos seeks. After a perilous journey, Kratos uses the Amulet of Uroborus to restore the statue and retrieve the <b>eyes.</b> <b>On</b> completing the Trials of Archimedes, Kratos is ambushed and captured by the Furies, who confiscate all of his items.|$|E

5|$|An ant's head {{contains}} many sensory organs. Like most insects, ants have compound eyes made from numerous tiny lenses attached together. Ant eyes {{are good for}} acute movement detection, but do not offer a high resolution image. They also have three small ocelli (simple <b>eyes)</b> <b>on</b> {{the top of the}} head that detect light levels and polarization. Compared to vertebrates, most ants have poor-to-mediocre eyesight and a few subterranean species are completely blind. However, some ants, such as Australia's bulldog ant, have excellent vision and are capable of discriminating the distance and size of objects moving nearly a metre away.|$|E
5|$|As the Tairona of the Colombian Caribbean coast, the Muisca {{made the}} zoomorphic figurines {{based on the}} fauna with their habitat of the area. Main animals used for their figures were the frog and serpents. The serpents were made in zig-zag shapes with <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> top of the head. Many serpentiform objects have the typical forked tongue of the snake {{represented}} {{as well as the}} fawns clearly added. Some of the snakes have beards, moustaches or even a human head. Researcher Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff theorised in his book Orfebrería y chamanismo in 1988 that the basis for the beards and moustaches may have been the abundant fish present on the Altiplano and essential part of the diet of the Muisca and their ancestors, as evidenced in Aguazuque; Eremophilus mutisii.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} was {{dissatisfied}} with this arrangement, it launched plans to establish its own venues. First it needed to secure a lot, and in the late 1920s lied its <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a parcel of land owned by Hamar Jernstøperi. However, the lot was sold to Oplandske Kreditbank in 1930 and the club had to negotiate purchasing the lot from the bank. The club established a new committee {{to look into the}} stadium issue. Hamar IL was invited to become part-owner of the venue, but they chose to remain at Hamar stadion. As Briskebyen was not able to secure a partner to share the costs with, opposition towards the project grew within the club. Yet, the decision to build the venue was taken by Briskebyen FL's annual meeting on 15 April 1934, with construction starting on 26 April.|$|E

5|$|Daspletosaurus had {{a massive}} skull that could reach more than 1meter (3.3ft) in length. The bones were heavily {{constructed}} and some, including the nasal bones {{on top of}} the snout, were fused for strength. Large fenestrae (openings) in the skull reduced its weight. An adult Daspletosaurus was armed with about six dozen teeth that were very long but oval in cross section rather than blade-like. Unlike its other teeth, those in the premaxilla {{at the end of the}} upper jaw had a D-shaped cross section, an example of heterodonty always seen in tyrannosaurids. Unique skull features included the rough outer surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the pronounced crests around the <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the lacrimal, postorbital, and jugal bones. The orbit (eye socket) was a tall oval, somewhere in between the circular shape seen in Gorgosaurus and the 'keyhole' shape of Tyrannosaurus. Split carinae have been found on Daspletosaurus teeth.|$|E
5|$|Ducks are {{medium-sized}} aquatic {{birds with}} broad bills, <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> {{the side of}} the head, fairly long necks, short legs set far back on the body, and webbed feet. Males, known as drakes, are often larger than females (simply known as ducks) and are differently coloured in some breeds. Domestic ducks are omnivores, eating a variety of animal and plant materials such as aquatic insects, molluscs, worms, small amphibians, waterweeds, and grasses. They feed in shallow water by dabbling, with their heads underwater and their tails upended. Most domestic ducks are too heavy to fly, and they are social birds, preferring to live and move around together in groups. They keep their plumage waterproof by preening, a process that spreads the secretions of the preen gland over their feathers.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the sides of the head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up the blood that flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E
