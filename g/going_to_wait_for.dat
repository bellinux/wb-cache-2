25|$|About 5:00a.m., Griffin's {{division}} {{was told to}} move to the left to J. Boisseau's house. Since Warren did not definitely know that Pickett had withdrawn his force, he still thought Griffin could intercept the Confederates. Griffin moved Chamberlain's brigade at the head of his column in line of battle with great care because Griffin thought they might strike the Confederate force if they emerged from White Oak Road while his division moved toward Crump Road. The Confederates did not attack and Griffin advanced on Crump Road. With a Confederate counterattack still thought to be possible as Crawford moved, Warren remained with Crawford until he reached Crump Road when Warren perceived that the Confederates from the White Oak Road Line were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> or follow the moving Union division.|$|E
500|$|When {{the open}} housing {{proposal}} became public, local reaction was often hostile. [...] Such {{was the reaction}} of many residents in Warren, Michigan, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, {{many of whom were}} ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of white flight. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. [...] HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. [...] Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. [...] Now the secretary said, [...] "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> 'nature to take its course.' What is really at issue here is responsibility– moral responsibility." ...|$|E
2500|$|As [...] the Carondelet {{closed in}} within firing range it {{opened fire on}} the fort, {{signaling}} Grant and the other generals to commence their attacks. After firing ten shells at the fort it withdrew down river. The next day Walke received orders from Grant to resume firing on the fort. Soon after the Carondelet took a hit, causing considerable damage and wounding a dozen men where it withdrew and transferred his men to the Alps and began repairs on his vessel. After repairs were made, the Carondelet resumed its attack on the fort until dusk. When news of the bombardment on the fort reached Foote he was angry that the siege had already begun, as it was his understanding that Grant was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> the arrival of his flotilla. {{in preparation for the}} battle Foote ordered Phelps to inspect the Pittsburg and the Carondelet, at which time he appointed him acting fleet captain for the day.|$|E

While there was no formal debate organised on the issue, Professor John William Draper of New York University was to talk on Darwin and social progress at a routine [...] "Botany and Zoology" [...] meeting. The new museum hall was crowded with clergy, undergraduates, Oxford dons and gentlewomen anticipating that Samuel Wilberforce, the Bishop of Oxford, would speak to repeat the savage trouncing he had given in 1847 to the Vestiges published anonymously by Robert Chambers. Owen lodged with Wilberforce the night before, but Wilberforce would have been well prepared as he had just reviewed the Origin for the Tory Quarterly for a fee of £60.
