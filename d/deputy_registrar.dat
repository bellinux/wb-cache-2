Battleground Texas spent its first year focusing on laying the foundation to reach Texan voters. Battleground Texas opposed legislation by State Representative Jim Murphy of Houston, which requires training every two years for <b>deputy</b> <b>registrars.</b> According to Battleground Texas, the new law creates an unnecessary barrier to adding new voters to the rolls.

25|$|To {{maintain}} {{public confidence}} in the judiciary, it is important to maximize judges' independence from personal interests, beliefs and prejudices, and ensure that they are not perceived to be affected by their personal beliefs and prejudices. The State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act ("SCJA") provide that judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, <b>Deputy</b> <b>Registrar</b> and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court, are not permitted to investigate or hear and decide any proceedings to or in which they are parties or personally interested, unless the parties to the proceedings have consented and the Chief Justice has given approval.|$|E
25|$|To {{safeguard}} judicial independence, Singapore law {{lays down}} special procedures {{to be followed}} before the conduct of Supreme Court judges may be discussed in Parliament and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, <b>Deputy</b> <b>Registrar</b> and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases {{in which they are}} personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges. Both the State Courts and Supreme Court have power to punish for contempt of court, though only the Supreme Court may convict persons of the offence of scandalizing the court.|$|E

25|$|Upon Sinnathuray's {{return to}} Singapore, he practised law {{with the firm}} Oehlers and Choa. He was a {{magistrate}} of the Subordinate Courts of Singapore between 1956 and 1959. He was then appointed <b>Deputy</b> <b>Registrar</b> and Sheriff of the Supreme Court of Singapore in 1959. Between 1960 and 1963 he was a Crown Counsel and deputy public prosecutor with the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC), {{before returning to the}} Supreme Court to become the Registrar from 1963 to 1966. He then became senior state counsel at the AGC (1966–1967), and First District Judge (1967–1970) and Senior District Judge– the most senior judge– of the Subordinate Courts (1971–1978). On 2 October 1978, he was appointed a Judge of the High Court of Singapore, and served until his retirement on 23 September 1997.

25|$|Administration of the Supreme Court {{is managed}} by its registry, which handles {{matters such as}} {{receiving}} and storing court documents filed in the court, and ensuring they are transmitted to judges for use during hearings. The Registry is headed by the Registrar who is assisted by the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Registrar,</b> Senior Assistant Registrars and Assistant Registrars. These officers are appointed by the President on the Chief Justice's recommendation, and {{are members of the}} Judicial Branch of the Singapore Legal Service. In addition to their administrative responsibilities, registrars deal with certain types of court proceedings in chambers, such as the assessment of damages, hearings of bankruptcy petitions and applications, interlocutory matters and pre-trial conferences. Registrars are also appointed as district judges or magistrates, which enables them to conduct preliminary inquiries to determine whether there are enough grounds for trying accused persons for criminal offences in the High Court. The Registry is also staffed by commissioners for oaths, interpreters, clerks and process servers. Justices' law clerks, who work directly under the Chief Justice's charge, assist Judges and Judicial Commissioners with legal research, particularly for Court of Appeal matters.|$|E
25|$|Immunity from {{suits for}} acts or {{omissions}} in {{the discharge of}} judicial duties can promote the independence of judges in their decision-making. The State Courts Act ("SCA") provides that a judicial officer of the State Courts – that is, a district judge, magistrate, coroner or registrar – may not be sued for any act done by him in the discharge of his judicial duty, {{whether or not the}} judge is acting within the limits of his jurisdiction, so long as at the time he in good faith believed himself to have jurisdiction to do or order the act complained of. There is no corresponding statutory provision applicable to Supreme Court judges, but at common law a superior court judge enjoys absolute immunity from personal civil liability in respect of any judicial act which he does in his capacity as a judge. The immunity extends to acts done outside the judge's jurisdiction, so long as he has acted reasonably and believing in good faith that the act was within his powers. Like judicial officers of the State Courts, the Registrar, <b>Deputy</b> <b>Registrar,</b> Assistant Registrars and other persons acting judicially in the Supreme Court are given statutory immunity from civil suit.|$|E

5000|$|In 2007-08, during then Senator Barack Obama’s {{campaign}} for president, Waller County {{made a number}} of voting changes without seeking preclearance.

The county also limited the number of new registrations any VDR could submit, thus limiting the success of voter registration drives. These practices were eventually prohibited by a consent decree.|$|R

25|$|Initially {{in private}} legal {{practice}} in Penang after being {{called to the}} Bar there, Tan joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1955 as a police court magistrate, and subsequently served as <b>Deputy</b> <b>Registrar</b> and Sheriff of the High Court (appointed November 1956), the Director of the Legal Aid Bureau (1959), and Senior Crown Counsel (1963). He also taught part-time at the Faculty of Law of the University of Singapore when it was started in 1956. In 1961, he represented Singapore at the Seminar on the Protection of Human Rights in the Administration of Criminal Justice organised by the United Nations in Wellington, New Zealand. With effect from 1 September 1963, he became the Solicitor-General, succeeding T. Kulasekaram who had been appointed a Supreme Court judge. He was then appointed Acting Attorney-General from 1 February 1967 to 31 December 1968, and as Attorney-General from 1 January 1969 to 30 April 1992. Tan was 39 {{years old when he}} became Attorney-General, and {{is believed to have been}} the youngest person to hold this post.

He became the Solicitor-General in 1963, Acting Attorney-General in 1967, and Attorney-General in 1969. During his tenure, he prepared many legal opinions on important constitutional and administrative law issues, and was also the Government's lead counsel {{in a number of}} notable cases. The Attorney-General's Chambers published the first reprint of the Constitution in 1980, and revised editions of Singapore statutes in 1970 and 1985. In 1990, it launched LawNet, a computer database then containing the full text of Singapore legislation.

25|$|The Opening of the Legal Year {{ceremony}} can {{be traced}} back to the ceremonial opening of the first assizes of the year which was held in the 19th century when Singapore was managed by the East India Company. The assizes were periodic criminal courts held in Singapore. The ceremony ceased for some years but was revived in 1923. In that year the ceremony involved the Chief Justice inspecting a Sikh guard of honour commanded by a subedar outside the Supreme Court, then being met by the Registrar, <b>Deputy</b> <b>Registrar</b> and Sheriff. The four gentlemen made their way to the Chief Justice's chambers in the courthouse, the route lined by police officers and members of the Bar. By 1926, the practice of attending a service at St. Andrew's Cathedral prior to the honour guard inspection had been revived, and in 1955 it was reported that a service was also held at the Cathedral of the Good Shepherd for Roman Catholic judges and lawyers. Church services ceased to be an official part of the ceremony when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, though members of the legal profession continued to attend special services in an unofficial capacity. Following Singapore's full independence in 1965, the ceremony became known as the Opening of the Legal Year. The ceremony was generally held on the first Monday in January following the end-of-year court vacation, but in 1971 for the first time it was held on the first Saturday in January to coincide with the inaugural Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Singapore. This set the trend for subsequent years. It appears that the parade by police officers during which Chief Justice inspected a guard of honour was abolished in the late 1960s or early 1970s.|$|E
