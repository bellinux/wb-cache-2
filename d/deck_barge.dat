50|$|Just Read the Instructions {{was built}} as a refit of the <b>deck</b> <b>barge</b> Marmac 303 in 2015 for service in the Pacific Ocean. It is home ported at the Port of Los Angeles in {{southern}} California.|$|E
50|$|An {{autonomous}} spaceport drone ship (ASDS) is an {{ocean-going vessel}} {{derived from a}} <b>deck</b> <b>barge,</b> outfitted with station-keeping engines and a large landing platform. Construction of such ships was commissioned by aerospace company SpaceX to allow for recovery of rocket first-stages at sea for high-velocity missions which do not carry enough fuel {{to return to the}} launch site after lofting spacecraft onto an orbital trajectory.|$|E
50|$|Parts of {{the middle}} section were {{converted}} into <b>deck</b> <b>barges</b> and named Venemac 5 and Venemac 6.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 2014, SpaceX {{commissioned}} {{the construction of}} autonomous spaceport drone ships (ASDS) from <b>deck</b> <b>barges,</b> outfitted with station-keeping engines and a large landing platform. The ships, which are stationed hundreds of kilometers downrange, allow for first stage recovery on high-velocity missions which cannot return to the launch site.|$|R
50|$|Under {{the name}} Gunderson Marine LLC, the Portland, Oregon, United States plant {{manufactures}} ocean-going conventional <b>deck</b> <b>barges,</b> double-hull tank barges, railcar/deck barges, barges for aggregates, and other heavy industrial products and ocean-going dump barges. In 2014, Gunderson Marine received two separate orders from Kirby Offshore Marine to build two articulated ocean-going and oil chemical tank barges, {{otherwise known as}} ATBs. Both ATBs should be completed in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|A powership is an {{existing}} ship {{that has been}} modified for power generation, a marine vessel, on which a power plant is installed {{to serve as a}} power generation resource. Converted from existing ships, powerships are self-propelled, ready to go infrastructure for developing countries that plug into national grids where required. Unmotorised powerships, known as power barges, are power plants installed on a <b>deck</b> <b>barge.</b> These are sometimes called [...] "floating power plants" [...] or [...] "barge mounted power plants". They were initially developed during World War II by General Electric for the War Production Board as a transportable large-scale power generation resource.|$|E
5000|$|The City of Midland 41 {{can be seen}} {{today as}} the <b>deck</b> <b>barge</b> Pere Marquette 41, that makes its home port in Ludington, Michigan. The barge {{is part of an}} {{integrated}} tug/barge pair with the historic tug Undaunted. The tug is almost as old as the ferry, built for the U.S. Navy as ATA 199 in 1944. The tug was renamed Undaunted when it worked for NOAA briefly in 1963 before serving at the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy until 1993. From 1993 until 1998, the tug worked on the Great Lakes as [...] Krystal K. before being renamed Undaunted and altered for integrated tug work. A man died in an accident on the barge in November 2013.|$|E
50|$|The Science Barge was {{conceived}} and designed by Ted Caplow and built by New York Sun Works, {{a non-profit organization}} that developed the project in order to educate students and teachers about {{the science of sustainability}} through hydroponic farming. The exhibits and ecological experiments that comprise the Science Barge float on a steel <b>deck</b> <b>barge,</b> approximately 115 feet long, constructed in the 1940s and used for cargo and utility work in New York Harbor until leased by New York Sun Works from Hughes Marine in 2006. The Science Barge urban farm systems were built on the barge in Red Hook, Brooklyn in the summer of 2006, and deployed briefly to pier 92 before opening to the public at pier 84 on May 4, 2007, adjacent to the Circle Line Sightseeing Cruises; and the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum. Over the next two years, the barge also made several visits to pier I in Riverside Park South as well as the Chelsea Piers complex in lower Manhattan.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, Weeks {{brought their}} first vessels to the fleet as two 120 ft by 38 ft <b>deck</b> <b>barges</b> were built by Richmond Steel for the company. In 1962, they added their first dump scow, the Weeks #250, a 171 ft by 43 ft vessel. Also in 1962, the Weeks Contracting Company {{was formed to}} remove {{limitations}} which might restrict the company in ventures they would choose to pursue.|$|R
5000|$|Hotel barges provide luxurious {{guest rooms}} (cabins), with en-suite bathrooms. They will {{normally}} {{also include a}} saloon (lounge) and dining room, and an open sun <b>deck.</b> Some <b>barges</b> also feature jacuzzis, hot tubs and small plunge pools on <b>deck)</b> [...] Many <b>barges,</b> especially those operating in southern France, are air-conditioned. Many hotel barges provide mobile internet access.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited I This report describes the conceptual {{design of a}} direct pump-out facility for Corps of Engineers 1 hopper dredges. Operational conditions were a significant wave height of 6. 0 ft, wind velocity of 30 knots, I and a current velocity of 2 knots. The mooring system was designed for operation in a minimum depth of 30 ft and a maximum depth of 45 ft. The following operational criteria were also required for the mooring design: (a) transportation by truck or rail, (b) rapid assembly {{with little or no}} diver support, and (c) installation with a minimum of lift support. The report examines five alternatives: (a) a guyed tower, tension leg platform (TLP), (b) a single anchor mooring (SALM), (c) a three-leg catenary anchor leg mooring (CALM), and (d) a four-leg CALM. The four-leg CALM was selected for further study because it best met the operational criteria. To accommodate truck transport, a 28 -ft-long, I 1 -ft 6 -in. -high, 7 -ft 6 -in. -deep capsule buoy was designed. The entire system (buoy, fluid swivel, mooring table, and buoy piping) is capable of being transported on six flatbed trucks or a single 40 - by 120 -ft <b>deck</b> <b>barge.</b> Hopper dredges Single-point mooring buo...|$|E

50|$|In the yard's second {{winter in}} business, it {{completed}} miscellaneous repairs on the steamer Philip R. Clarke, {{as well as}} beginning construction on a 245 ft dump scow for Donjon Marine, christened the Witte 4003. In addition, they constructed six 165 ft <b>deck</b> <b>barges</b> for Port Albany Ventures and Donjon Marine, the PAV 101, PAV 102, PAV 103, Sue B., Witte 1401, and Witte 1402. In 2008, the company began construction on a 740 ft barge to be named Erie Trader and 135 ft tug to be named Clyde VanEnkevort after the father of Dirk VanEnkevort. The tug and barge will mate together to create an 840 ft cargo ship.|$|R

50|$|<b>Barge</b> <b>decks</b> are {{maintained}} {{to minimize the}} formation of large rust scales, this is typically accomplished by painting the deck as needed.|$|R
50|$|If {{the current}} cargo {{is not the}} same as the residue {{remaining}} on the <b>barge</b> <b>deck,</b> the residue should be swept up against the barge coaming and in some cases may be shoveled and placed into a container or bag.|$|R
50|$|March 31, 2006: The 285-foot-long steel barge Apache, towed by the tug Crosby Skipper, swings wide on a {{turn and}} slams into a {{concrete}} support column. Chunks of reinforced concrete dropped onto the <b>barge's</b> <b>deck,</b> and cracks rippled through the 48-foot-long beam.|$|R
25|$|As {{the cargo}} {{is carried on}} the main <b>deck,</b> the <b>barges</b> have {{considerable}} tank capacity belowdecks. In addition to 12,413.75 m3 of ballast water in the side tanks and 12,304 m3 of void space {{in the middle of}} the barge there are tanks for 592.66 m3 of heavy fuel oil that can be used to replenish the fuel tanks of the pusher, 82.05 m3 of marine diesel oil for the pusher's auxiliary engines and the barge's own generator and 82.05 m3 of freshwater.|$|R
2500|$|The {{following}} year, {{the company}} introduced Kamakani, a 438ft (133.5m) <b>deck</b> cargo <b>barge</b> at SOMAR in Coos Bay. It was characterized as [...] "the result of 10years of evolution" [...] in the company's bay class barges, 8ft (2.4m) longer and 29ft (9m) {{wider than the}} previous four barges. New technology incorporated a streamlined hull, lateral slats like the wing of an airplane, new hydro-lift foil for steering, and thick, rubbery paint on the barge to weather-seal the Kamakani, doubling the life expectancy to 30years.|$|R
5000|$|On 15 June 1945, {{the cargo}} ship left San Diego with two 83' US Coast Guard cutters on <b>deck</b> and a <b>barge</b> in tow. The tow was dropped at Pearl Harbor, and the {{remainder}} of the cargo was offloaded at Saipan after arrival on 13 July.|$|R

25|$|While it {{was once}} a popular game played in pubs all over London (generally sited by the Thames river), it is now only played at the Freemasons Arms in Hampstead. The origins of this {{skittles}} game are vague, but it is thought by some to have been started by Dutch sailors, possibly playing on the <b>decks</b> of moored <b>barges.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{deportees}} {{were kept}} below <b>decks</b> on the <b>barges</b> and apparently fed a daily ration of 200 grams of bread per person. Twenty tons of flour - about four kilos per person - were also transported, but the barges contained no other food, cooking utensils, or tools. All supervisory personnel, two commanders and fifty guards, were newly recruited. The guards had no shoes or uniforms.|$|R
5000|$|Later, it was {{established}} that the LCM-6 {{was too small to}} serve effectively, and howitzers were positioned on Navy AMMI pontoon barges. When these proved to difficult to move and to have too deep of a draft, barges formed of Navy P-1 pontoons were the workable solution. [...] M101A1, and later M102 howitzers were mounted onto a baseplate welded to the <b>barge</b> <b>deck,</b> allowing the howitzer to be traversed 360 degrees.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hooroo! Haul up!" [...] shouted Rooney, {{following}} the order with a yell {{that sounded like}} the concentrated voice of infuriated Ireland. At {{the same time he}} seized the life-line and air-tube, and tugged at both, not four times, but nigh forty times four, and never ceased to tug until he found himself gasping on the <b>deck</b> of the <b>barge</b> with his helmet off and his comrades laughing round him.|$|R
5000|$|A table {{bridge is}} a {{moveable}} bridge {{in which the}} deck moves along the vertical axis. Hydraulic pillars under the bridge raise the bridge <b>deck</b> to allow <b>barge</b> traffic to pass beneath it. In contrast to a lift bridge, where the deck is pulled upwards along towers, {{the deck of a}} table bridge is pushed upwards by otherwise hidden pillars. The name originates from the fact that when open it resembles a table.|$|R
60|$|The {{girls and}} Walter watched the {{operation}} of getting up the anchor and of setting the foresail and jib. They remained on <b>deck</b> while the <b>barge</b> beat down the long reach past the dockyards, and then with slackened sheets rounded the wooded curve down into Gillingham Reach, then, accompanied by Roberts, they went below. Here they were soon hard at work. The great packages were opened, and mattresses and bedclothes brought out.|$|R
50|$|Supporters of {{this plan}} insist that {{the length of the}} {{construction}} would only be 40 km, linking the Han River with the Nakdong River. The canal would require sufficient width, depth and height of bridge <b>decks</b> to allow <b>barges</b> passage. Major portions of the Han and Nakdong are far narrower and shallower than is required, with most of the bridges on these rivers being unsuitable as their clearance is too low.The scale of construction would be enormous; a number of bridges would need to be rebuilt and both rivers would require extensive dredging along the 540-kilometer route.|$|R
60|$|The {{assembly}} {{seemed so}} noisy and furious that the nobles in attendance on the king {{were afraid to}} allow him to land. They advised him to remain in the barge, at a little distance from the shore, and to address the people from the deck. The king resolved to do so. So the barge lay floating on the river, the oarsmen taking a few strokes {{from time to time to}} recover the ground lost by the drift of the current. The king stood upon the <b>deck</b> of the <b>barge,</b> with his officers around him, and asked the men on the shore what they wished for.|$|R

5000|$|In October 2014, SpaceX {{clarified}} {{that the}} [...] "solid surface" [...] {{would be a}} floating platform constructed from a barge in Louisiana, and confirmed that they would attempt to land {{the first stage of}} the fourteenth Falcon 9 flight on the platform.For the landing to succeed, the 60 ft-wide span of the rocket landing legs must not only land within the 170 ft-wide <b>barge</b> <b>deck,</b> but would need to also deal with ocean swell and GPS errors.In late November, SpaceX revealed that the landing barge would be capable of autonomous operation and would not need to be anchored or moored; it was hence called an autonomous spaceport drone ship.

50|$|The {{greenhouse}} on {{the barge}} is approximately 1200 ft2, purchased new from Nexus, Inc and constructed {{in place on}} the barge. The structure is aluminum and secured to the <b>barge</b> <b>deck</b> via bolts and custom-made welded steel brackets. The walls of the greenhouse are glass and the roof is a rigid, doubled walled polycarbonate plastic. Ventilation is achieved via four mechanical fans, a padwall evaporative cooling system, and a large, automatically controlled atrium roof vent to maximize passive ventilation. Rainwater is harvested from the greenhouse roof and stored in tanks with a 1200-gallon aggregate capacity before being used to irrigate hydroponic crops in a broad and constantly evolving variety of different growing systems and media. The barge has also hosted a number of aquaponic and marine science experiments, including cultivation of tilapia, catfish, crayfish, clams, and oysters, among others.|$|R
5000|$|In {{that mental}} state, I {{had to take}} a long journey up the river [...] [...] [...] Lost in thought, I sat on <b>deck</b> of the <b>barge,</b> {{struggling}} to find the elementary and universal concept of the ethical that I had not discovered in any philosophy. I covered sheet after sheet with disconnected sentences merely to concentrate on the problem. Two days passed. Late on the third day, at the very moment when, at sunset, we were making our way through a herd of hippopotamuses, there flashed upon my mind, unforeseen and unsought, the phrase : “Reverence for Life”. Ehrfurcht vor dem Leben The iron door had yielded. The path in the thicket had become visible. Now I had found my way to the principle in which affirmation of the world and ethics are joined together!” ...|$|R
