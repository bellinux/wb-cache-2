5|$|Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts {{that had been}} agreed at {{the inception of the}} National Government. <b>Interest</b> <b>on</b> the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the war debt.|$|E

5|$|Given Armstrong's concerns, the {{administration}} employed general counsel J. Patrick Abell {{to file a}} friendly test case to determine {{the constitutionality of the}} incentive package. While the suit was pending, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported that {{the administration}} had failed to include the <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the bonds used to finance the expenditures in its estimation of the cost; this, plus the cost overruns reported by the Herald-Leader, had already pushed the total cost of the package to about $354million by late September 1986.

5|$|In March 2008, Pastafarians in Crossville, Tennessee, were {{permitted}} to place a Flying Spaghetti Monster statue in a free speech zone on the courthouse lawn, and proceeded to do so.

5|$|In general, {{those in}} Europe who own {{large amounts of}} euros are served by high {{stability}} and low inflation. Those who now need to earn euros including countries, which need to pay <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> large debts, are likely better served with a slightly weaker euro leading to more export because a lower euro would better see investors chances for (companies in) southern European countries to grow themselves out of the crisis. As a result, investing there would become less risky and push interest rates for southern countries {{more in line with}} the European average.|$|E
5|$|In {{the interim}} between the Import Duties Act and the Ottawa Conference, Chamberlain {{presented}} his first budget, in April 1932. The gold standard {{had been abandoned}} {{in the early days}} of the National Government; the Bank of England sought its restoration. Chamberlain, on advice from his officials, declined to restore the gold standard, realising that a devalued pound would improve the balance of trade. Otherwise, Chamberlain maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed to at the inception of the National Government: Chamberlain cut means-tested benefits and public sector wages, which proved to be an unpopular move. He also cut interest rates, which led to a house-building boom in the south of England and supported plans to clear slums. <b>Interest</b> <b>on</b> the war debt had been a major cost in each budget. Chamberlain was able to reduce the interest rate on most of Britain's war debt from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to payment of <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the war debt.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to measure the effects of TV {{advertisements}} on the Internet bulletin boards. It aims to clarify how the viewes 2 ̆ 7 <b>interests</b> <b>on</b> TV advertisements are reflected on their images on the promoted products. Two kinds of time series data are generated based on the proposed method. First one represents the time series fluctuation of the <b>interests</b> <b>on</b> the TV advertisements. Another one represents the time series fluctuation of the images on the products. By analysing the correlations between these two time series data, we try to clarify the implicit relationship between the viewer 2 ̆ 7 s <b>interests</b> <b>on</b> the TV advertisement and their images on the promoted products. By applying the proposed method to an Internet bulletin board that deals with certain cosmetic brand, we show that the images on the products {{vary depending on the}} difference of the <b>interests</b> <b>on</b> each TV advertisement...|$|R

A Mumbai Bar Association passed a resolution proclaiming that none of its members would represent Kasab. However, the Chief Justice of India stated that Kasab needed a lawyer for a fair trial. A lawyer for Kasab was eventually found, but was replaced due to a conflict of <b>interest.</b> <b>On</b> 25 February 2009, Indian investigators filed an 11,000-page chargesheet, formally charging Kasab with murder, conspiracy, and waging war against India among other charges.|$|E
5|$|Marguerite Louise's extravagances perturbed Ferdinando {{because the}} Tuscan {{exchequer}} was nearly bankrupt; {{it was so}} empty that when the Wars of Castro mercenaries were paid for, the state {{could no longer afford}} to pay <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> government bonds. Accordingly, the interest rate was lowered by 0.75%. The economy, too, was so decrepit that barter trade became prevalent in rural market places. In August 1663 Marguerite Louise delivered a boy: Ferdinando. Two more children followed: Anna Maria Luisa in 1667 and Gian Gastone in 1671.|$|E
5|$|Money was {{allegedly}} lent by the banks {{to their employees}} and associates so they could buy shares in those same banks while simply using those same shares as collateral for the loans. Borrowers were then allowed to defer paying <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> the loan {{until the end of}} the period, when the whole amount plus interest accrued was due. These same loans were then allegedly written off days before the banks collapsed.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{principal}} sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an excise tax on whiskey. In his first Tariff Bill in January 1790, Hamilton proposed to raise the three million dollars needed to pay for government operating expenses and <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> domestic and foreign debts {{by means of an}} increase on duties on imported wines, distilled spirits, tea, coffee, and domestic spirits. It failed, with Congress complying with most recommendations excluding the excise tax on Whiskey (Madison's tariff of the same year was a modification of Hamilton's that involved only imported duties and was passed in September).|$|E
5|$|Powell {{implemented}} {{the use of}} the state's sinking fund to pay <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> school bonds, a measure which had passed over Governor Helm's veto, but Helm refused to carry out. In 1855, Kentucky's voters passed by landslide a measure to raise the school tax from two cents per hundred dollars of taxable property to five cents per hundred dollars. The measure enjoyed the support of both Governor Powell and superintendent of public schools Robert Jefferson Breckinridge. Under the leadership of Powell and Breckinridge, Kentucky's school system became among the strongest in the antebellum South.|$|E
