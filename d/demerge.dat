25|$|In the 2003 election, Charest {{had promised}} to allow the cities that had been {{forcibly}} merged by the Parti Québécois government to hold referendums which would allow to <b>demerge</b> and return to their previous situation. This promise was seen as key to his victory in many ridings, {{such as those in}} the suburbs around Longueuil and Quebec City and the continued support of the Anglophone community in the West Island of Montreal. In office however, Charest retreated from his promise. Municipalitites were allowed to hold demerger referendums, if at least 10 per cent of the electorate signed a petition calling for them, and only if more than 35 per cent participated in the voting process. In some former municipalities, such as Saint Laurent on the Island of Montreal, the turnout of the vote was of 75.2 per cent in favour of a demerger, but it was invalidated because the voter turnout was just 28.6 per cent.|$|E
500|$|Sandvika Station is [...] from OsloS, at [...] elevation. The track layout {{has been}} criticised by among others Norsk Bane, for not {{permitting}} high through speeds. A sharp curve before the station will not permit trains to travel {{at more than}} , {{even if they are}} not scheduled to stop at the station. This will increase travel time, and hinder the efficiency of the line should it be used later for high-speed lines to Vestfold or Western Norway.

2500|$|Yorkshire and Tyne Tees applied {{separately}} for {{renewal of the}} franchises in 1980, and each won. [...] However, the two companies were required to <b>demerge</b> from January 1982 {{as a condition of}} the renewal of their ITV franchises. [...] The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the successor to the ITA, recognised the criticism, reported The Economist, [...] "that Trident was London-dominated, overly diversified, and {{out of touch with the}} grass roots. It instructed Trident to set up both companies as independents and to retain only a minority shareholding in each." [...] The IBA imposed the condition that for the 1980 franchise round a company could only own one franchise, although it could earn up to 30percent of another. [...] By November 1981, Trident had sold all but residual stakes in the two companies (15% and 20% respectively). When the new licences started in January 1982, Trident sold all but 30percent of Yorkshire, and 25percent of Tyne Tees.|$|E

5000|$|The {{process to}} <b>demerge</b> from the forced {{amalgamation}} was complicated.(see Quebec municipal referendums, 2004 and 2000-2006 municipal reorganization in Quebec) The first stage was {{to sign a}} register {{in order for a}} referendum to be held, then the population had to vote a second time. In several areas, the referendums failed because even though a majority of those voting supported demerging, it did not meet the required threshold of 35% of registered voters. This process was detailed in a documentary film called The Village Resists: The Forced Municipal Mergers of Quebec by Ryan Young that followed the municipality of Ste-Anne-de-Bellevue as it fought successfully to <b>demerge.</b>|$|E
