500|$|Scott Weinberg from FEARnet {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review by claiming it is, [...] "Arguably the most accomplished feature from the late Charles B. Pierce," [...] and [...] "while the movie offers a slightly stodgy 'voice-over' narration and some moments that seem plucked straight out of '1970s police procedural 101', including a few painful moments of cop-related comic relief, it also delivers some legitimately effective atmosphere, several cool character actors <b>doing</b> <b>fine</b> work, {{and a handful of}} sincerely creepy moments." ...|$|E

500|$|Chapman Flack, in {{reviewing}} a training video by Rosenberg, finds {{the presentation of}} key ideas [...] "spell-binding" [...] and the anecdotes [...] "humbling and inspiring", notes the [...] "beauty of his work", and his [...] "adroitly <b>doing</b> <b>fine</b> attentive thinking" [...] when interacting with his audience. Yet Flack wonders {{what to make of}} aspects of Rosenberg's presentation, such as his apparent [...] "dim view of the place for thinking" [...] and his building on Walter Wink's account of the origins of our way of thinking. To Flack, some elements of what Rosenberg says seem like pat answers at odds with the challenging and complex picture of human nature history, literature and art offer.|$|E
500|$|The second {{plan for}} White, {{unveiled}} by Spassky in 1990, aims at a kingside blitzkrieg with moves like Kg1–h1, f2–f4, Be2–d3 and Qd1–h5. In the original game Black did not fathom White's idea, so that after 10.Kh1 a5?! 11.f4 Nc6 12.Bd3 d6 13.Qh5! h6 14.Rf3 Black's pieces were ill-placed to counter White's attack. A more principled plan for Black is to react in the centre, specifically targeting the backward e3-pawn and e4-square. After 10.Kh1 d6 11.f4 Nd7! 12.Bd3 Nf6 13.Qf3 Ng4 14.Nd1 f5! and Black {{has succeeded in}} inhibiting White's e3–e4 expansion [...] As Black was <b>doing</b> <b>fine</b> with the 11.f4 move-order, White has been searching for a new path with 10.Kh1 d6 11.Na4!? b6! 12.Bd2 a5 13.Nxc5 bxc5 14.f4 Nd7 15.Bf3 when Jeremy Silman prefers White. White has even dared the immediate 10.f4 Nc6 11.Bd3 when it is extremely dangerous for Black to take the offered e3-pawn, as White gets a fierce kingside attack for free.|$|E
500|$|West Ham {{began the}} second half as the {{stronger}} team, and Vic Watson received the ball in a good goalscoring position but mis-hit his shot. Eight minutes into {{the second half}}, Bolton added a second goal in controversial circumstances. Outside-forward Ted Vizard played the ball into a central position and Jack Smith hit the ball past Hufton. West Ham's players claimed that the ball had not entered the goal but rebounded into play from the goalpost, but referee D. H. Asson overruled them, stating that in his view the ball had entered the goal but then rebounded off a spectator. West Ham also claimed that Bolton had received an unfair advantage, as a Bolton fan at pitchside had kicked the ball towards Vizard, but Asson disregarded these claims as well and confirmed Bolton's second goal. At this point the crowd began to sense that Bolton would emerge victorious and many began heading towards the exits. Neither team had any more serious chances to score, and {{the remainder of the}} match was largely a stalemate with little inspired play. Late in the game, West Ham captain George Kay attempted to persuade Asson to abandon the match, but Bolton captain Joe Smith reportedly replied [...] "We're <b>doing</b> <b>fine,</b> ref, we'll play until dark to finish the match if necessary". The score remained 2–0 to Bolton until the final whistle. [...] The King presented the FA Cup trophy to Joe Smith and then left the stadium to cheers from the crowd. West Ham trainer Charlie Paynter attributed his team's defeat to the damage the pitch had suffered before kick-off, saying [...] "It was that white horse thumping its big feet into the pitch that made it hopeless. Our wingers were tumbling all over the place, tripping up in great ruts and holes".|$|E

500|$|J.R. {{explains}} to Jock and Bobby that Ewing Oil is <b>doing</b> <b>fine,</b> leaving Bobby suspicious. J.R. had swindled {{most of the}} other oilmen that he knows to salvage Ewing Oil by convincing their cartel to buy worthless oil fields from him just prior to nationalization. Cartel member, Jordan Lee hounds the Ewings about their underhandedness and makes sure they know Seth Stone committed suicide {{as a result of the}} dealings. Soon thereafter, Sue Ellen nurses a hangover while watching the local news to see reports that Ewing oil sold off its holdings just before the nationalization. The report ends with the story of the widowed Marilee Stone, whose husband Seth had bought shares from Ewing Oil. Marilee's calls to J.R. are refused. Cartel member Vaughn Leland, who lost $20 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in the deal, reaches Ewing Oil offices to express his belief that J.R. duped him, but Jock refuses to offer any restitution. All of the cartel members have lost everything they had in the deal and J.R. increased his wealth in the dealings. [...] The Ewings question whether J.R. took advantage of inside information. J.R. assures his father and brother that such unethical behavior was beneath him. [...] Lucy Ewing spends time with her professor/boyfriend who is only interested in her for one reason. Attorney Alan Beam visits Kristin Shepard for ideas about how J.R. might have swindled everyone. Shepard suggests Hank Johnson may have information. [...] Shepard has been tape recording secrets of the cartel members from between the sheets and learned how J.R. got them all to buy his oil wells. Beam asks her to try to get information from Johnson by pretending to still be J.R.'s secretary. Bobby talks with Miss Ellie about Pam who has flown to Corpus Christi to find her mother, Rebecca. They both think it is because she is grieving from the recent death of her father Digger. Sue Ellen apologized for her drunken behavior the prior night and laments that it gave J.R. fodder for his plans to re-institutionalize her. Bobby says he will try to keep J.R. from taking that action. J.R. tells Johnson to ignore Shepard's request for records and to shred them. [...] Sue Ellen sees a psychiatrist, Dr. Elby. She gets a reminder about drinking until you are unconscious and promises to stop. J.R. confronts Kristin about her mischief. He tries to bribe her to leave, but she does not accept the offer. J.R. spends some time with Sue Ellen. She alerts him that Bobby is going to speak up for her. He is not worried. She then inquires about whether he is going to be unfaithful. When he leaves for another woman she gets upset, but finds a gun lying around, which gives her pause.|$|E

In fact, Leno's comment was in stark contrast with his own assessment of O'Brien's performance {{less than three months}} prior: [...] "Personally, I think Conan is <b>doing</b> <b>fine.</b> He's beating Dave in the demo, maybe not in the popular one right now because Dave has {{a lot of other things}} going that have people watching for whatever reason, so I think that's not really a fair thing.

Krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, Boukreev could not directly help his clients descend.

2500|$|In 1994, {{punk rock}} entered the {{mainstream}} {{with the success}} of The Offspring's Smash, Bad Religion's Stranger than Fiction, Rancid's Let's Go and Green Day's Dookie, and NOFX had a commercial breakthrough with the release of its fifth studio album Punk in Drublic, their best-selling album to date. The album was certified gold with support from Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ, which played the song [...] "Leave It Alone". A music video was made for the song but did not receive airplay on MTV. Fat Mike was quoted saying [...] "We made the ‘Leave It Alone' video, and we decided not to send it to MTV. We just didn't {{want to be a part}} of that machine, of that ‘punk wave.'" [...] Due to the success of Punk in Drublic, NOFX received many offers to sign with major record labels, but the band declined the offers. The following year, the band released its first live album I Heard They Suck Live!!. In the liner notes the band explicitly rejected the advances of major record labels and radio airplay, stating [...] "We've been <b>doing</b> <b>fine</b> all these years without you so leave us alone!"

2500|$|Midway through filming, Zamora's health {{suddenly}} declined. Producer Jon Murray states, [...] "He {{got sick}} {{much faster than}} he expected. That's when he made us promise {{to tell his story}} till the end." [...] Also complicating Zamora's time in the Real World house was his conflict with housemate Rainey, which began early on in their stay there. In addition to the various personality traits of Rainey's with which all the roommates took issue, Rainey mocked Zamora's Cuban accent, denigrated his career as an educator, and made aforementioned gay-related jokes that offended Zamora. Winick described Rainey as [...] "obnoxious" [...] and [...] "homophobic", and Zamora, feeling that the stress of his confrontations with Rainey was contributing to his deteriorating health, announced he would move out. The entire cast voted instead to evict Rainey from the house. Zamora's health continued to deteriorate, however, and he suffered night sweats, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, and weight loss, and slept more frequently. Although he was able to participate in activities like parasailing during the group’s trip to Hawaii, the cast grew more worried about him nonetheless, often covering up for him during their weekly [...] "confessional" [...] interviews with the producers by telling them that Zamora was <b>doing</b> <b>fine</b> when they knew otherwise.|$|E
