25|$|In 1980, the 2.25-litre petrol {{and diesel}} engines {{received}} five main bearing crankshafts to increase rigidity and the transmission, axles and wheel hubs were strengthened. This {{was the culmination of}} a series of updates to the transmission that had been made since the 1960s to combat the all-too-common problem of the rear axle half-shafts breaking in heavy usage. This problem was partly due to the design of the shafts themselves. Due to the <b>fully</b> <b>floating</b> design of the rear wheel hubs, the half shafts can be removed very quickly without even having to jack the vehicle off the ground. The tendency for commercial operators to overload their vehicles exacerbated this flaw which blighted the Series Land Rovers in many of their export markets and established a reputation that continues in many markets to the present day. This is despite the 1982 re-design (mainly the increase of driving-splines from 10 to 24 to reduce stress) that all but solved the problem.|$|E

500|$|The Storm was {{primarily}} meant to satisfy Israeli military needs, but capable {{long and short}} versions are produced for the local civilian market. Like the Jeep, it has a conventional front-engine design with a driver and passenger seated behind the engine, and room for cargo or passengers behind them. It is powered by an AMC 3.983 litre 6-cylinder in-line petrol with fuel injection developing [...] at 4,700rpm, fitted with Vortox 2-stage air cleaner or a Volkswagen 2.5 litre 4-cylinder turbocharged diesel developing 88kilowatts (118hp) at 4,200rpm. The front axle is <b>fully</b> <b>floating</b> and the rear axle is semi-floating, while a reinforced frame and body as well as good angles of approach and departure (40° and 37° for short frame, 40° and 26.5° for long frame) add to the Storm's off-roading capability.|$|E

30|$|McKinnon (2006) {{points out}} that even (and especially) Chinese holders of US public debt may {{experience}} deterioration of their assets. Perhaps even more importantly, McKinnon and Schnabl (2012) state that China cannot <b>fully</b> <b>float</b> its currency since {{it will not be}} able to lend an amount sufficient to balance the trade surplus; the RMB would continue to appreciate unless the central bank stepped in to purchase dollars. China is seeking to expand lending in RMB through its Silk Road projects and participation in global lending institutions. Over time, this will provide China with further room in which to liberalize its exchange rate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} analysis of a direct-drive linear slide used linear mortor. The alloy steel carriage is <b>fully</b> <b>floated</b> by twelve hydrostatic bearings, and it is force-closed. It has very high stiffnesses, 1700 N/µm in vertical direction and 690 N/µm in horizontal direction. The working stroke of slide is 200 mm. The slide is driven by a ironless linear motor. The optic linear encoder {{was used for the}} measurements and feedback. To analyze the static and dynamic performance of the slide, the modelling and simulation process, using the finite element analysis method, is presented...|$|R

40|$|Prolonged {{worldwide}} {{economic depression}} forces some economists {{and policy makers}} to demand for a tougher regulation to protect their domestic economy. If implemented, this {{may lead to a}} high tariff and non-tariff regime that ruled the pre-globalised world economy. This paper examines the consequences of a tariff protected trade regime. It takes up the case of trade misreporting phenomena under the framework of protected regime. It builds up a basic trade mis-invoicing model and then develops a collusion between underreporting traders of partner countries. I show that high tariff barrier gives incentives not only to the importers but also to the exporters to gain by underreporting the trade statistics. Interestingly, this paper shows that even if foreign exchange is <b>fully</b> <b>floated,</b> underground foreign exchange market can be created and exporters may rationally underreport without any gain through black market premium a departure from conventional theory.

5000|$|On November 10, 2014, the Central Bank of Russia {{decided to}} <b>fully</b> <b>float</b> the ruble in {{response}} to its biggest weekly drop in 11 years (roughly 6 percent drop in value against USD). [...] In doing so, the central bank abolished the dual-currency trading band within which the ruble had previously traded. The central bank also ended regular interventions that had previously limited sudden movements in the currency's value. Earlier steps {{to raise interest rates}} by 150 basis points to 9.5 percent failed to stop the ruble's decline. The central bank sharply adjusted its macroeconomic forecasts. It stated that Russia's foreign exchange reserves, then the fourth largest in the world at roughly $480 billion, were expected to decrease to $422 billion by the end of 2014, $415 billion in 2015, and under $400 billion in 2016, in an effort to prop up the ruble.|$|R

50|$|Since 2005, the Chinese {{government}} has overturned its previous policy of pegging the Renminbi to the US dollar. The renminbi now floats within a small margin {{compared to a}} basket of currencies selected by the Chinese government.

However, during the onset of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, the renminbi was unofficially repegged to the US dollar. It was again depegged from the dollar in June 2010.|$|R
50|$|The mP6 {{made use}} of the MMX {{instruction}} set and had three MMX pipelines which allowed the CPU to execute up to three MMX instructions in a single cycle.
