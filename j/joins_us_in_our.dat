In its final form, FWI is a 29 -item instrument with two parts. Part 1 consists of three 5 -item subscales designed to measure strength of belief in free will, determinism, and dualism. Part 2 consists of a series of fourteen statements designed to further explore the complex network of people’s associated beliefs and attitudes about free will, determinism, choice, the soul, predictability, responsibility, and punishment. Having presented the construction and validation of FWI, we discuss several ways that it could be used in future research, highlight some as yet unanswered questions that are ripe for interdisciplinary investigation, and encourage researchers to <b>join</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> efforts to answer these questions...|$|R

Since the JMIR community has successfully collaborated on the "CONSORT-eHealth" in the past, we would like to use the same strategy to explore the need for a new definition of eHealth {{and the creation of a}} taxonomy for this field. Therefore, we hereby submit a call to all JMIR-readers, to fill out a 4 -question survey on their ideas about a refined eHealth definition.

Europe will be born of this, a Europe which is solidly united and constructed around a strong framework, he said. The declarations immediate goal was for France, Italy, West Germany, and the Benelux countries to share strategic resources {{in order to make}} war not only unthinkable but materially impossible. The immediate outcome of this initiative was the 18 April 1951 creation of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), first of the three European Communities and a predecessor of the European Union. At the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 18 April 1951, the six signatory states affirmed in a separate document that this date represented Europes birth: [...] "By the signature of this Treaty, the participating Parties give proof of their determination to create the first supranational institution and that thus they are laying the true foundation of an organised Europe.
