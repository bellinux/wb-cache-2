5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E

He distinguishes his stance from Neo-Malthusianism which seeks to manage systems by controlling demand and from market fundamentalism which believe free markets can provide timely solutions to any problem. Several problems in advancing basic science are identified: human cognitive limits, intrinsic complexity of field, limits of scientific institutions, and social and cultural values regarding science.|$|E
5|$|In this, the milieu is {{interested}} in developing unified world views to discover {{the nature of the}} divine and establish a scientific basis for religious belief. Figures in the New Age movement—most notably Fritjof Capra in his The Tao of Physics (1975)—have drawn parallels between theories in the New Physics and traditional forms of mysticism, thus arguing that ancient religious <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> now being proven by contemporary science. Many New Agers have adopted James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis that the Earth acts akin to a single living organism, although have expanded this idea to include the idea that the Earth has consciousness and intelligence.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide range}} of {{theological}} and philosophical <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> presented through Krishna in Hindu texts. Ramanuja, a Hindu theologian whose works were influential in Bhakti movement, presented him in terms of qualified monism (Vishishtadvaita). Madhvacharya, a Hindu philosopher whose works led to the founding of Haridasa sect of Vaishnavism, presented Krishna {{in the framework of}} dualism (Dvaita). Jiva Goswami, a saint from Gaudiya Vaishnava school, described Krishna theology in terms of Bhakti yoga and Achintya Bheda Abheda. Krishna theology is presented in a pure monism (advaita, called shuddhadvaita) framework by Vallabha Acharya, who was the founder of Pushti sect of vaishnavism. Madhusudana Sarasvati, an India philospher, presented Krishna theology in nondualism-monism framework (Advaita Vedanta), while Adi Shankara, who is credited for unifying and establishing the main currents of thought in Hinduism, mentioned Krishna in his early eighth-century discussions on Panchayatana puja.|$|E

5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, and {{universal}} love. William Borman {{states that the}} key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the philosophical foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism and universal love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood {{in the context of the}} Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.|$|E

5|$|Intentionality is the {{capacity}} of mental states to be directed towards (about) or be in relation with something in the external world. This property of mental states entails that they have contents and semantic referents and can therefore be assigned truth values. When one tries to reduce these states to natural processes there arises a problem: natural processes are not true or false, they simply happen. It would not {{make any sense to}} say that a natural process is true or false. But mental ideas or judgments are true or false, so how then can mental states (ideas or judgments) be natural processes? The possibility of assigning semantic value to ideas must mean that such <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> about facts. Thus, for example, the idea that Herodotus was a historian refers to Herodotus and {{to the fact that he}} was a historian. If the fact is true, then the idea is true; otherwise, it is false. But where does this relation come from? In the brain, there are only electrochemical processes and these seem not to have anything to do with Herodotus.|$|E
5|$|Smith, {{a philosopher}} who forged the new {{discipline}} of economics, is, by contrast, depicted in contemporary attire, showing {{his concern for}} the practical matters of economic activity, a gown draped over his shoulder retains the connection to philosophy and academia. Smith's economic <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> also encoded into the statue: the plough behind him represents the agrarian economics he supplanted, the beehive before, {{is a symbol of}} the industry he predicted would come. His hand, resting on a globe, is obscured by the gown: a literal presentation of Smith's famous metaphor of the invisible hand. The life-and-a-half size statue of Smith, is cast in bronze from a plaster model by the sculptor and was unveiled in 2008. It was funded by private subscriptions organised by the Adam Smith Institute.|$|E
5|$|The major {{substantive}} {{criticisms of}} Satin's work have remained constant over time. His <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> sometimes {{said to be}} superficial; they were characterized as childish in the 1960s, naive in the 1970s, poorly reasoned in the 1980s and 1990s, and overly simple in the 2000s. His ideas have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political {{in the sense of}} not being capable of challenging existing power structures. His work is sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual, and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.|$|E
30|$|A rule is {{that each}} and every paradigm-shift idea passes through four phases in its lifetime. In the phase # 1, the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> radicalized (people laugh on it). In the phase # 2, the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> {{attacked}} (some people aggressively try to destroy it). In the phase # 3, the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> accepted (most {{of those who were}} attacking it, now keep telling around that it <b>was</b> their <b>idea,</b> or at least that they always were supportive of that idea). In the final phase # 4, the <b>idea</b> <b>is</b> considered as something that existed forever (those who played roles in initial phases are already dead, physically or professionally, by the time the fourth phase started).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: International Data Encryption Algorithm (<b>IDEA)</b> <b>is</b> a {{block cipher}} {{designed}} by James Massey of ETH Zurich and Xuejia Lai and was first described in 1991. As a block cipher, {{it is also}} symmetric. The algorithm {{was intended as a}} replacement for the Data Encryption Standard (DES). <b>IDEA</b> <b>is</b> a minor revision of an earlier cipher, Proposed Encryption Standard (PES); <b>IDEA</b> <b>was</b> originally called Improved PES (IPES). International Data Encryption Algorithm (<b>IDEA)</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most popular}} cryptography algorithms in date since the characteristic of <b>IDEA</b> <b>is</b> suitable for hardware implementation. This paper presents an efficient hardware structure for the modulo (2 n + 1) multiplier, which is the most time and space consuming operation in IDEA. The proposed modulo multiplier saves more time and area cost than previous designs. The proposed design enables <b>IDEA</b> to <b>be</b> implemented on hardware with high performance and low cost. Simulation results obtained from Vertex FPGA system developed by Xillinx indicate that the new design has 37. 57 MHz maximum speed for encryption and decryption with eight pipeline stages for each round...|$|R

5|$|The poem also {{contains}} many of Southey's {{views on the}} Catholic Church and how it influenced his political views. Part of this comes from Southey's trip to Lisbon and Madrid in 1795 where he was exposed to what he believed as Catholic superstition. He believed that {{the church and the}} Catholic leaders kept the people ignorant, and he believed that the Muslims that were cast out of Spain were more tolerant. Many of these <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> repeated in a speech within the work by Henry V, and the character attributes ignorance and vice to oppression. Southey believed {{that the only way to}} escape from these problems was for people to believe they were part of one universal family. His enemies later described Southey's as holding Jacobin belief and claimed he supported the extremism of Robbespierre, when his sympathies laid to a larger extent with the Girondins that were replaced by the Jacobins. However, the poem is still subversive since it described a French patriot fighting against the English that parallels the strife during Southey's time.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{interest}} on the biology of reef organisms was focussed on aspects related to his geological idea of subsidence; in particular, {{he was looking for}} confirmation that the reef building organisms could only live at shallow depths. FitzRoy's soundings at the Keeling Islands gave a depth limit for live coral of about 20fathoms (37m), and taking into account numerous observations by others, Darwin worked with a probable limit of 30fathoms (55m). Modern findings suggest a limit of around 100m, still {{a small fraction of the}} depth of the ocean floor at 3000–5000m. Darwin recognised the importance of red algae, and he reviewed other organisms that could have helped to build the reefs. He thought they lived at similarly shallow depths, but banks formed at greater depths were found in the 1880s. Darwin reviewed the distribution of different species of coral across a reef. He thought that the seaward reefs most exposed to wind and waves were formed by massive corals and red algae; this would be the most active area of reef growth and so would cause a tendency for reefs to grow outwards once they reach sea level. He believed that higher temperatures and the calmer water of the lagoons favoured the greatest coral diversity. These ecological <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> still current, and research on the details continues.|$|E
5|$|Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac {{attempts}} in Louis Lambert {{to construct a}} viable theory to unify spirit and matter. Young Lambert attempts this goal in his Traité de la Volonté, which – having been confiscated by a teacher – is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to connote... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life.... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance.... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he thought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression.... According to him, the Mind and <b>Ideas</b> <b>are</b> the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in Franz Mesmer, who postulated the theory of animal magnetism, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes {{a section of the}} Traité de la Volonté which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.|$|E

5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where <b>ideas</b> <b>are</b> translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
