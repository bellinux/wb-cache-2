50|$|The wrestler applies an {{inverted}} facelock to a seated opponent and places his <b>far</b> <b>leg</b> between the opponent's legs and pushes his near leg's knee against the opponent's back. The wrestler then pulls the opponent's head backwards {{with their arms}} and the opponent's <b>far</b> <b>leg</b> outwards with their leg.|$|E

50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1975 he was hired as bandleader, opening act and bass player in Bob Dylan's band. He played with Dylan during the Rolling Thunder Revue tour and on the <b>Far</b> East <b>leg</b> of Dylan's 1978 World Tour. His singing and playing is {{featured}} on many Bob Dylan recordings.|$|R

50|$|The small package—or inside cradle—is a pinning {{maneuver}} {{where the}} attacking wrestler hooks the opponent's <b>far</b> <b>leg</b> with their {{legs and the}} opponent's near leg with their free arm, ending {{up on top of}} the opponent, pinning their shoulders against the mat.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{calculation}} of a scalar pentagon integral with two consecutive massive external legs having an equal mass propagator embedded between them. We also deal with the two situations where the <b>farest</b> external <b>leg</b> is either massive or not. The relevance of the calculation comes from its application in many perturbative QCD calculations {{as well as in}} QCD corrections for weak precesses.

60|$|Her father, {{his thumbs}} in the armholes of his {{waistcoat}} and his <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> apart, {{looked at her}} in blank and speechless amazement; her mother, with more consideration but equal lack of sympathy, patted her gently {{on the back of her}} hand.|$|R
50|$|When the {{opponent}} {{has been turned}} over onto his back, the aggressor attempts to pin him by tightening the grip on the neck, putting the nelson in more deeply so that the aggressor's elbow is hooking {{the opponent}}'s neck. Often the aggressor remains perpendicular to the opponent, chest on chest. The aggressor's free hand is used to minimize struggling by hooking the opponent's near or <b>far</b> <b>leg</b> or crotch.|$|E
50|$|With the {{opponent}} on his back, the wrestler standing beside him, sits with his leg over and between {{the opponent}}'s legs (often using a legdrop to the knee). Then places the opponents <b>far</b> <b>leg</b> in the knee-pit of the near leg, finishing the submission by putting the opponents ankle {{on top of his}} own ankle and rolling both onto their bellies and pushing back with the wrestler's knees.|$|E
5000|$|A cradle is a move {{where the}} {{attacker}} performs the cradle by grabbing {{the neck of}} his opponent with one arm, and wrapping the elbow of the other arm behind the knee of the opponent. The wrestler then locks both hands together, forcing the opponent's knee toward his face, and rolls the opponent over onto his back. The hooked leg can be either the near leg (a [...] "near-side cradle") or the <b>far</b> <b>leg</b> (a [...] "far-side cradle").|$|E
50|$|In all of {{the eight}} Open Championships held so <b>far,</b> a third <b>leg</b> decider was never required. In October 1939 just before the new season began all {{competitions}} were cancelled due to the war. It would be 1947 before {{the return of the}} Championships.|$|R
50|$|A {{different}} style {{is to make}} use of a spreader bar. By keeping the <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> apart both the sense of imbalance {{as well as that of}} vulnerability is increased. Making the subject wear high-heeled shoes or stand on a small surface in this position helps still further.|$|R
60|$|The {{rock was}} one of those tremendously solid brown, or rather black, rocks which emerge from the sand like {{something}} primitive. Rough with crinkled limpet shells and sparsely strewn with locks of dry seaweed, a small boy has to stretch his <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> apart, and indeed to feel rather heroic, before he gets to the top.|$|R
50|$|The wrestler {{lifts up}} a {{leg of a}} face-up {{opponent}} and wraps one of their legs around the other leg before dropping to a kneeling position, thus locking the opponent's leg behind the wrestler's knee. The wrestler then reaches over and grabs the opponent's <b>far</b> <b>leg</b> and places {{it on top of}} the trapped foot of the opponent. The wrestler then performs a forward roll while maintaining the hold. This forces the opponent onto their chest while the wrestler ends in a sitting position facing the same direction as their opponent. From here the wrestler can reach forward and perform many upper body submissions as well.|$|E
50|$|The {{opponent}} lies {{face down}} on the mat. The wrestler lies face up and slightly {{to the side of the}} opponent. The wrestler then hooks their <b>far</b> <b>leg</b> across the neck of the opponent. The wrestler then hooks his hands behind the opponent's head, having one arm pass over their own leg and the other under. The wrestler then pulls backwards with his arms and pushes forward with his leg, causing pressure. The name comes from its innovator's name, Koji Kanemoto. This move is commonly transitioned from a reverse STO. another variation sees the attacker performing a reverse STO then locking the regular koji clutch in but crosses their legs in a modified figure four headscissors.|$|E
50|$|However, {{difficulty}} can {{be added}} by changing the leverage, which places more emphasis on specific limbs and muscles, e.g. a one legged squat works a <b>leg</b> <b>far</b> stronger than a two legged squat, which not only requires strength but progressing to a one legged squat builds strength along the way. The same can be seen with one arm pushups, pull ups, and many other exercises.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fire if {{he raises}} his hand," [...] said Holmes, quietly. We were within a boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I can see {{the two of them}} now as they stood, the white man with his <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern.|$|R
60|$|Jim Bricknell {{himself was}} a tall big fellow of thirty-eight. He {{sat in a chair}} in front of the fire, some {{distance}} back, and stretched his long <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> in front of him. His chin too was sunk on his breast, his young forehead was bald, and raised in odd wrinkles, he had a silent half-grin on his face, a little tipsy, a little satyr-like. His small moustache was reddish.|$|R
50|$|The spladle is {{a wrestling}} {{technique}} commonly {{used as a}} counter and pinning move to single leg take downs. When opponents shoot in and grab the leg the wrestler will drop their weight on the opponents head to prevent advancement of the take down, from there they may reach across the body with their arms to grab hold of the opponents <b>far</b> side <b>leg,</b> once completed they wrap the near side leg with the leg targeted for the take down and roll forward onto the mat. When on the floor {{it is important to}} control both legs of the opponent as the wrestler wants to bring the knees of his opponent as close to inline with the opponents head as possible.|$|R
50|$|Muskrats live in {{and around}} Weed Lake. They weigh {{approximately}} 2 kg. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair and, to aid them in swimming, are slightly flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. After they breed, the mother muskrat has 2-9 babies. The baby muskrats leave their family and nest when they are about 20 days old. They often travel and move homes. To find them you must go to wetlands like marshes and bogs. They like to eat insects, cattails, sedges, rushes, pondweeds, grass, frogs, snails, and fish. Muskrats’ predators include wolves, coyotes, and foxes. People usually don’t set traps or choose to hunt muskrats. What makes them interesting {{is that they have}} amazing eyes that can see <b>far.</b> Their <b>legs</b> are also very fast with very sharp nails.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{engineering}} and medical concerns, arm replacement is more difficult than leg replacement. Arm replacement technology was <b>far</b> behind <b>leg</b> replacement technology when DARPA began the Revolutionizing Prosthetics team in 2006. In May 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration approved {{the first of the}} two prosthetic arms developed under that program. Earlier in 2014, DARPA's Biological Technologies Office announced the launch of a new Hand Proprioception and Touch Interfaces (HAPTIX) program, which aims to deliver naturalistic sensations to amputees and, in the process, enable intuitive, dexterous control of advanced prosthetic devices; provide the psychological benefit of improving prosthesis [...] "embodiment"; and reduce phantom limb pain. Ling has described the problem of developing a high quality artificial arm as [...] "doggone hard". Ling's Revolutionizing Prosthetics team's work could lead to the restoration of sight and hearing. Using his artificial arms, amputees could precisely move their artificial arms with just thought.|$|R
60|$|At length the {{arrangements}} were fixed, {{and the party}} began to advance towards the aquatic hermit, who, by this time aware of their approach, drew himself up to his full height, erected his long lean neck, spread his broad fan-like wings, uttered his usual clanging cry, and, projecting his length of thin <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> behind him, rose upon the gentle breeze. It was then, with a loud whoop of encouragement, that the merchant threw off the noble hawk he bore, having first unhooded her {{to give her a}} view of her quarry.|$|R
6000|$|The {{other end}} of the rope Tarzan {{fastened}} to the stem of the tree, then he quickly cut the bonds securing Numa's legs and leaped aside as the beast sprang to his feet. For a moment the lion stood with <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> outspread, then he raised first one paw and then another, shaking them energetically in an effort to dislodge the strange footgear that Tarzan had fastened upon them. Finally he began to paw at the bag upon his head. The ape-man, standing with ready spear, watched Numa's efforts intently. Would the bags hold? He sincerely hoped so. Or would all his labor prove fruitless? ...|$|R

40|$|At {{first it}} is easy to accept the coming of the dry season, for the greenness of things takes a while to give way to the dust. But with time it is not so easy to shrug and simply say that the coming of the dry season after the rainy one is as normal as night coming after day. Such {{indifference}} is impossible when the dry season has truly arrived and has sunk its claws into people and things. The only good thing about the land then is the sudden, wild thought of leaving, to leave never to come back but go as <b>far</b> as your <b>legs</b> can carry you, to some place where the drought is merely a thing to be told about...|$|R
40|$|Background Lumbal spinal {{stenosis}} causes back pain spreading as <b>far</b> as the <b>legs</b> and thereby constrains {{the activities of}} daily living. By walking in a flexed position patients try to extend the foramina intervertebralia. Claudicatio intermittens / spinalis forces them to stop walking and sit down, because of pain, para-sthesias or paresis. 1 Loss of physical activity {{may lead to a}} decline of physical condition and slowly restrict independence. 2 The differential air pressure technology of AlterG treadmills reduces body weight in lower extremity up to 80 % and facili-tates normal postural control. 5 Methods After completing physiotherapy, a 70 -year-old left sided lower leg amputed man started extensive endurance train-ing. 250 m of walking were challenging. Therefore antigravity treadmill training was initiated in April. Results Early therapy, visual analog scale (VAS) was set at 5. 5...|$|R
6000|$|One party {{attracted}} {{our attention}} {{as soon as}} we went aboard. It was made up of a lady and two gentlemen-hunters. The lady wasn't a hunter, but she was dressed in a suitable costume to go about with fellows who had on hunting-clothes. The men wore long yellow boots that came ever so <b>far</b> up their <b>legs,</b> and they had on all the belts and hunting-fixings that the law allows. The lady wore yellow gloves, to match the men's boots. As we were going up the St. John's, the two men strode about, in an easy kind of a way, as if they wanted us to understand that this sort of thing was nothing to them. They were used to it, and could wear that style of boots every day if they wanted to. Rectus called them [...] "the yellow-legged party," [...] which wasn't a bad name.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, however, even Pollyanna's robust {{optimism}} is {{put to the}} test when she is struck by a car and loses the use of her legs. At first she doesn't realize the seriousness of her situation, but her spirits plummet when she is told what happened to her. After that, she lies in bed, unable to find anything to be glad about. Then the townspeople begin calling at Aunt Polly's house, eager to let Pollyanna know how much her encouragement has improved their lives; and Pollyanna decides she can still be glad that she at least has had her legs. The novel ends with Aunt Polly marrying her former lover Dr. Chilton and Pollyanna being sent to a hospital where she learns to walk again and is able to appreciate the use of her <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> more as a result of being temporarily disabled and unable to walk well.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw himself}} into the {{attitude}} of a lunging fencer, to reach after his oilskin coat; and afterwards he staggered all over the confined space while he jerked himself into it. Very grave, straddling his <b>legs</b> <b>far</b> apart, and stretching his neck, he started to tie deliberately the strings of his sou'-wester under his chin, with thick fingers that trembled slightly. He went through all the movements of a woman putting on her bonnet before a glass, with a strained, listening attention, {{as though he had}} expected every moment to hear the shout of his name in the confused clamour that had suddenly beset his ship. Its increase filled his ears while he was getting ready to go out and confront whatever it might mean. It was tumultuous and very loud--made up of the rush of the wind, the crashes of the sea, with that prolonged deep vibration of the air, like the roll of an immense and remote drum beating the charge of the gale.|$|R
50|$|The {{final weeks}} of the season saw Konta with the {{opportunity}} of breaking into the top ten and qualifying for the WTA Finals for the first time. Her first event on the <b>Far</b> Eastern <b>leg</b> of the WTA Tour was the Wuhan Open. A repeat of her Australian Open quarterfinal victory over Zhang Shuai took Konta to the third-round. There she defeated Carla Suárez Navarro to record her fifth top ten win of 2016 and set up a last-eight meeting with Petra Kvitová, where she was knocked out of the competition. The following week saw Konta in Beijing for the China Open. She was drawn to face Anastasija Sevastova in the opening round in a re-match of their US Open meeting of a few weeks prior, Konta gaining revenge for the defeat in New York. Victory over Tímea Babos at the next stage set up a third-round clash with Karolína Plíšková, which Konta won, reversing a previous 0-5 head-to-head record against the Czech. Konta progressed to the semifinal by beating Chinese number one Zhang Shuai for the second successive week. She defeated Madison Keys in the last-four to reach her first WTA Premier Mandatory final. Victory over Keys saw Konta enter the top ten {{for the first time in}} her career, making her the first British woman since Jo Durie in 1984 to be ranked amongst the elite of the WTA. It also lifted her into a qualifying place for the WTA Finals. Konta was beaten in the final by Agnieszka Radwańska.|$|R
5000|$|The Snowshoe {{is a rare}} breed, {{partly due}} to the {{difficulty}} of breeding cats with markings and patterns that conform well to breed standards. The Snowshoe's pattern relies on recessive genes and other factors to produce desired results. One gene, which causes the [...] "V" [...] facial pattern is an example of incomplete dominance. If the offspring produced has two dominant genes for the marking, then the feature will be larger than a cat with one dominant gene. However, other factors may influence the feature, which makes it difficult to predict the outcome. Another issue is the white boots, which can be caused by a piebalding gene or a gloving gene. The genes are difficult to control, and many cats' boots extend too <b>far</b> up the <b>leg,</b> do not reach far enough up the leg, or the cat completely lacks white. As such, pet-quality Snowshoes usually have too much white, too little white, or white features are mismarked. The cats' body type further complicates breeding, as the breeder must achieve the correct head shape and ear set, while still maintaining the American Shorthair's body structure and the length of the Siamese.|$|R
