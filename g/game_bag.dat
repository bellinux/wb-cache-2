6000|$|... "I've got {{a hatchet}} in my <b>game</b> <b>bag,</b> {{and you can}} cut some pine boughs with that. And you will find some cord in my <b>game</b> <b>bag,</b> too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I am sure. I've been {{up there}} hunting myself," [...] added Andy. He {{saw that the}} cutter {{contained}} a <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> and two gun cases.|$|E
60|$|Snap and Shep {{put some}} {{provisions}} in their <b>game</b> <b>bags,</b> readjusted their snowshoes, and soon set off.|$|R
60|$|They stopped {{long enough}} to pick several quarts of the berries, stowing the fruit away {{in one of the}} cleaned-out <b>game</b> <b>bags.</b> Then on they went as before.|$|R
5000|$|On the New Zealand {{game show}} It's in the Bag, {{three of the}} <b>game</b> <b>bags</b> have booby prizes in them, ranging from rubber ducks to boxes of washing powder.|$|R
60|$|The <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> {{was filled}} with eatables, and cups, plates, etc., and then they tied up the tent flaps and drew the boat still higher {{up out of the}} water.|$|E
60|$|Sunday passed quietly, and on Monday morning Jerry {{proposed}} {{they take}} along a <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> full of provisions and {{climb to the}} top of the rocky hill in the centre of the island.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what, Uncle Barney. And you're {{welcome to}} {{stay as long as}} you please," [...] {{announced}} the owner of the cabin. The boys had brought along the old lumberman's <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> and shotgun.|$|E
60|$|The {{boys had}} had an early breakfast, and now they filled one of their <b>game</b> <b>bags</b> with a well-cooked lunch, and also carried with them a thermos bottle filled with hot chocolate.|$|R
60|$|That day {{the boys}} tramped nearly two miles around the island. They took their guns {{with them and}} came back with their <b>game</b> <b>bags</b> full of birds. Returning, they were {{thoroughly}} tired out, but nevertheless resolved to set a watch.|$|R
60|$|Preparations were {{accordingly}} made, {{and half}} an hour later the party of three set off. It was agreed that Chet should first do the carrying of the hurt one, and Andy brought up the rear with the guns, <b>game</b> <b>bags,</b> and other things.|$|R
60|$|Andy {{leaped to}} one side, {{and the next}} instant the man's gun dropped down on the rocks and fell in the snow. The <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> followed. They now saw the man in his {{unconscious}} state turn partly over.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{recognize}} you as my guardian," [...] was Andy's reply. As he spoke he tiptoed {{his way to}} the window and opened it. Then he threw out a small bundle, and his gun and <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> followed.|$|E
60|$|At {{these words}} all made a hasty {{examination}} of their belongings. Some underwear was gone, also a storm coat, {{and a number}} of other things. The tramp had taken a <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> full of provisions, and the pair of skates belonging to Snap.|$|E
6000|$|... "We might combine {{business}} with pleasure," [...] remarked Jack. [...] "We can take our guns and <b>game</b> <b>bags,</b> {{and also a}} substantial lunch. Then if we see any signs of game going or coming, we can take our time about getting back here." ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} day, and the young oarsman and Harry had {{come over to the}} island to see what they could shoot. They left Jack in charge of the yacht and Blumpo with his father, and started off with guns and <b>game</b> <b>bags</b> for the interior.|$|R
6000|$|... "We could if we {{were sure}} {{we were going to}} return this way," [...] {{answered}} Jack. [...] "But we had better take them along, for we may return to the Hall by an entirely different route. We'll place our skates in our <b>game</b> <b>bags</b> for the present;" [...] and this advice was followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll have {{to climb}} up to get them," [...] he murmured, and threw down his gun and his <b>game</b> <b>bag.</b> A limb was handy and he swung himself up into the tree and worked {{his way toward the}} trunk, where the {{squirrels}} lay.|$|E
60|$|Meanwhile {{the author}} of all this misery had come upon the scene. He was a young man, whose rifle and well filled <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> showed {{that he had been}} hunting, and his face {{expressed}} the liveliest sorrow for what he had so unwittingly done.|$|E
60|$|Instead of answering, Andy {{pushed a}} chair to the window. In another instant he had mounted it, {{and then he}} crawled through the opening. He landed in a heap in the snow, and {{scrambled}} up immediately. With bundle, gun, the <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> in his possession, he ran back of the shed and then down the road leading to the village.|$|E
60|$|The strangers had not {{waited to}} be welcomed {{by the other}} members of the party. Without {{stopping}} to be invited they began preparations for cooking on rather an extensive scale, using the contents of their well filled <b>game</b> <b>bags,</b> and the savory odor which soon arose brought Jake to a full realization of the good fortune that had come to them.|$|R
60|$|Saturday morning dawned {{bright and}} clear, {{and the four}} Rovers {{obtained}} their breakfast {{as early as the}} rules of the school permitted. Then, with <b>game</b> <b>bags</b> and guns slung over their shoulders, they set out on their skates up the lake shore and then along the Rick Rack River, the wind of the day previous having cleared large portions of the ice of snow.|$|R
60|$|The noon hour {{found them}} {{still on the}} hunt. Fortunately they had brought some lunch along {{in one of the}} <b>game</b> <b>bags,</b> and they sat down in a sunny and {{sheltered}} nook to eat this, warming up a can of coffee over a tiny campfire Chet kindled. Then the hunt was renewed, and kept up in various places until the sun began to go down over the woods to the westward.|$|R
60|$|Halfway {{down the}} edge of the cliff was a narrow ledge, and on this rested the body of a man,--a hunter, as was shown by his gun and <b>game</b> <b>bag.</b> He had tumbled from the top of the cliff, and the fall had {{rendered}} him unconscious. He lay half over {{the edge of}} the ledge, and was in imminent danger of falling still further and killing himself.|$|E
6000|$|... "No sauce like hunger sauce," [...] laughed John Barrow, {{as he saw}} {{the lads}} stow the food away. [...] "Once I was trampin' the {{mountains}} all day without a mouthful when I chanced to look in a corner o' my <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> and found a slice o' bread, {{at least two weeks}} old. I ate that bread up, hard as it was, and nuthin' ever tasted sweeter." ...|$|E
60|$|The boy's {{eyes flashed}} {{for an instant}} {{and he was on}} the point of making a bitter reply to his relative. But then his mouth closed {{suddenly}} and he turned away. In silence he drew off his slippers, donned his big boots, and put on his overcoat and his winter cap. Then he pulled on his gloves, slung a <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> over his shoulder, and reached for a gun that stood behind a door.|$|E
50|$|O'Connor's {{best year}} was 1995. He became a centre half forward and strung {{together}} {{a number of}} impressive <b>games,</b> kicking <b>bags</b> of goals.|$|R
50|$|Warhawk Alley is also host {{to eight}} billiards tables, {{multiple}} video <b>game</b> consoles, <b>bag</b> toss <b>games,</b> a dart board, and an air hockey table.|$|R
50|$|Muldowney {{signed for}} Isthmian League Premier Division side Wealdstone in July 2007. He made his {{competitive}} debut {{for the club}} in a 4-1 win over Folkestone Invicta on 18 August 2007. Muldowney scored his first goal for the club in a 2-2 league draw with Heybridge Swifts on 25 September and scored again in the following <b>game,</b> <b>bagging</b> the winner in a FA Cup second qualifying round win over Carshalton Athletic. He made 23 appearances during the 2007-08 season, failing to establish himself in the side, with 10 of his appearances coming in cup competitions.|$|R
60|$|Den, the {{youngest}} of the Greens, was a boy about three years my senior, and a most attractive lad. I met him some years ago in California, a successful doctor, and we talked of the days when I was his slave and humbly carried his powder horn and <b>game</b> <b>bag.</b> Ellis Usher, who lived in Sand Lake and often hunted with Den, is an editor in Milwaukee and one of the political leaders of his state. In those days he had a small opinion of me. No doubt I was a nuisance.|$|E
60|$|When {{the hunter}} {{did not come}} home in the evening his wife grew very anxious, and when his <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> was found close to the mill-pond she guessed at once what had befallen him. She was nearly beside herself with grief, and roamed round and round the pond calling on her husband without ceasing. At last, worn out with sorrow and fatigue, she fell asleep and dreamt that she was {{wandering}} along a flowery meadow, {{when she came to}} a hut where she found an old witch, who promised to restore her husband to her.|$|E
60|$|The sight which {{met their}} gaze filled {{them with a}} pity and {{a strong desire to}} be of assistance. There, in the snow, lay an elderly man, clad in the garb of a hunter or lumberman, with a shotgun and a well-worn <b>game</b> <b>bag</b> beside him. Over the man's legs and one outstretched arm, rested the upper portion of a large pine tree, which had evidently crashed down because of the weight of snow upon it but a short time before. The man lay on his chest, and it was all he could do to raise his head to cry for aid.|$|E
50|$|This game came to {{be known}} as The Body <b>Bag</b> <b>Game.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2014 Incheon Asian <b>Games,</b> Low <b>bagged</b> {{the women}} singles silver medal {{after losing to}} her compatriot Nicol David. She also bagged the gold medal for women's team {{alongside}} David and her teammates.|$|R
25|$|In the 2013 Philippine National <b>Games,</b> Lacuna <b>bags</b> 9 {{gold medals}} that was {{includes}} 100-meter butterfly with 58.62 seconds, 200m individual medley in 2:13.39 minutes, 50m freestyle in 24.64 seconds and 100m breaststroke in 1:11.55 minutes.|$|R
