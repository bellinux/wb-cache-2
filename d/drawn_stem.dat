Ch. 3,) are perhaps hardly enough on which to found an exception in his favor.) He is the only painter who ever <b>drew</b> the <b>stem</b> of a tree, Titian having come the nearest before him, and excelling him in the muscular development of the larger trunks, (though sometimes losing the woody strength in a serpent-like flaccidity,) but missing the grace and character of the ramifications. He is the only painter who has ever represented the surface of calm, or the force of agitated water; who has represented the effects of space on distant objects, or who has rendered the abstract beauty of natural color. These assertions I make deliberately, after careful weighing and consideration, in no spirit of dispute, or momentary zeal; but from strong and convinced feeling, and with the consciousness of being able to prove them.|$|R

The thesis <b>draws</b> connections <b>stemming</b> from the ongoing existence and challenges of the Maya people of Yucatán in Mexico, not to the evident resistance of ongoing indigenous movements in the Americas, but to their endurance. Here, I examine the multiplicity of events occurring in the Maya solar of Yucatán, a house and garden plot that has historically supported an intricate indigenous system of land, livelihoods and identities. The solar is today under threat of extinction along with {{the way of life}} and the people it once fully sustained. This threat is itself a contested terrain as the current and historical endurance of the solar and of Maya peoples may be proof of their resilience. This thesis focuses on the unfolding transformations of the solar and the responses of Maya populations, gathered in Yucatán at different points between November 2013 and May 2015. Based on qualitative research that combines interviews and secondary documentary analysis, the research seeks to recognise and validate the human experience and situated knowledge of Maya populations. The data collected is interpreted through an overarching theoretical and methodological framework drawn from the Decoloniality perspective, which addresses the continuation of colonial powers within the modern world and highlights the historical denial of power, knowledge and being to native societies under the long-term effects of ‘coloniality’. Through the Decoloniality perspective, I contest and rework existing theoretical frameworks of ‘Primitive Accumulation’, ‘Latin American urban studies’, and ‘Indigenous Geographies’ in order to foreground indigenous and colonial questions from a political and epistemological Latin American perspective. Extensively, this research: 1) provides new evidence of the Maya’s plight, bringing to light their realities and their everyday life; 2) decolonises knowledge through further developing the Decoloniality perspective; and, 3) challenges the general understandings of Maya populations as a far more complex and contradictory than their usual dichotomous representation: as urban/rural, modern/traditional and indigenous/non-indigenous...|$|R

The first, classified generally as "L'Art Brut," was a vigorous confrontation of the materials of art and the artist's relationship to them. The second, known as the "Grand Hourloupe," is an obsessive exploration of a very artificial design that began as a black-and-white line <b>drawing.</b> Dubuffet's art <b>stems</b> from a rejection of Western culture, although he was trained in Paris between 1918 and 1922, in that very culture. In its place Dubuffet focused on the common man whom he took to be more fresh and spontaneous than art bred from culture. He sought out "raw art" or art made by those outside formal culture. While he emulated this art, to produce similar art, Dubuffet had to purge himself of years- of education. For him, this meant an intense investigation of the physical matter that concerned the artist. This took place between 1943 and 1960. At the commencement and conclusion of this period, he produced significant bodies of lithographs, the study of which enlightens understanding of the entire phase. Upon the exhaustion of the first phase, the artist was free to explore the very original "Hourloupe" design, the art for which he is most readily identified today. M. A. (Master of Arts...|$|R

Matching of words is not a trivial process since words have grammatical (inflectional and derivational) variations.

However, these approaches normalize the word variations in their rightmost side. We claim it will be beneficial to additionally concentrate on word normalization at the left side, by removing word prefixes. In this report, we present the architecture and functioning of a software tool that can be used as the first stage of a Statistical Prefix Processor, a system that could effectively remove prefixes from words and act as a preprocessing stage of text analysis applications.

40|$|Understanding {{signals in}} the niche that {{regulate}} stem cell behaviours {{is important for}} applications such as tissue engineering, and limitations in ex vivo/in vitro recapitulation of some stem cell niches, particularly the bone marrow, have led researchers to attempt to delineate signalling mechanisms present in vivo using a reductionist approach.

Physical stimuli such as mechanical stiffness and topography are known to significantly impact stem cell behaviours; being translated through adhesions, intracellular tension and mechanotransduction, which can alter gene expression and thus cell fate. In this review general properties of the stem cell niche are initially described, using intestinal and bone marrow niches as examples. The lesser-described physical stimuli of nanotopography and the mechanisms by which stem cells respond and interact with it are described, including biochemical and physical mechanotrasduction, chemical and physical signal integration and adhesion mechanisms in both anchorage-dependent and -independent cells. Specific examples of nanotopographical influence over stem cell differentiation are highlighted and parallels <b>drawn</b> between the <b>stem</b> cell niche and these ‘synthetic’ in vitro observations.

50|$|Another {{interpretation}} of this group of drawings {{is that they were}} didactic and created for the purposes of teaching Cavalieri how to <b>draw.</b> This interpretation <b>stems</b> from a comment from Vasari that Cavalieri was given these works “because he was learning to draw.” Also, {{on the back of the}} Tityus drawing, the figure of Tityus has been redrawn into a representation of the Risen Christ. It was originally thought that Michelangelo had done the tracing on the back but some scholars now think that the Risen Christ was completed by Cavalieri as a drawing exercise. Cavalieri’s hand has been more readily identifiable due to the discovery of several drawing by him including a copy of the Fall of Phaeton which was another presentation drawing given to him by Michelangelo.Another aspect of the drawings suggesting they were teaching tools is that all four of the presentation drawings given to Cavalieri (Tityus, Ganymede, The Fall of Phaeton, and The Dreamer) all have the main figure facing different directions. For example, Tityus has the figure with his head downward facing the left while the figure from the Dreamer has his head up and to the right. Also, the figure in Ganymede is ascending vertically while the figure from The Fall of Phaeton is falling upside down. These four drawings as a group show the body facing all four cardinal directions and could have served to show Cavalieri how to depict the nude male form in different basic positions.|$|R

Small ultimate branching systems, which dichotomize up to four times, are borne on the third- and fourth-order axes in helices and compressed helices. Elliptical sporangia are borne upon the recurved tips of ultimate branching systems otherwise similar to the sterile examples. The entire plant {{up to the second}} or third divisions of the ultimate branching systems is covered with fine spines. The nature of the whorled arrangement of branching in the first-order axes sets the plant apart from the Trimerophytina and other contemporary and earlier land plants. A close comparison can be <b>drawn</b> with permineralized <b>stems</b> from the Middle Devonian of North America belonging to Iridopteridales Stein, which show anatomical traits which may correspond to the branching patterns found in Anapaulia. There are morphological similarities to compression fossils of the iridopteridalean Ibyka Skog et Banks, for which both permineralizations and a limited amount of compression material was described. Anapaulia is thus tentatively assigned to the Iridopteridales...|$|R
