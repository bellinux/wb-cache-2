5|$|I am very honoured {{to unveil}} this blue plaque and thank English Heritage for honouring John in this way. This {{particular}} flat has many memories {{for me and}} {{is a very interesting}} part of our history. In what would have been John's 70th year, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> you all for commemorating John and this particular part of his London life, one which spawned so much of his great music and great art.|$|E
500|$|When the 2000 Republican National Convention {{began in}} Philadelphia {{at the end}} of July, McCain took his Straight Talk Express to meet with his delegates and {{supporters}} before formally releasing them to Bush. [...] There were tears from McCain, his wife Cindy, and some of the campaign staff and delegates. [...] Many of McCain's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush, and the Times wrote that, [...] "Politics as usual with its compromises, cruelties and emotional costs — caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend." [...] McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention, not his antagonist Governor Hull. [...] On August 1, the second night of the convention, McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush, in particular trying to solidify Bush's national security and foreign policy credentials. In it, McCain connected his family to Bush's, making reference to former President George H. W. Bush's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., McCain's grandfather. [...] He said directly of the nominee, [...] "I support him. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> him. And I am proud of him." [...] The Almanac of American Politics called it [...] "a moving, elegiac speech that ended as if in a minor key." ...|$|E
2500|$|MacCallum died in Wyoming, Delaware. He was a {{respected}} country doctor, described as “mainly just a kind, traditional doctor. He made house calls, {{which is something}} you don't see today. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> him -- he delivered my first baby.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{his final}} {{departure}} from Rideau Hall as governor general, Massey retired to Batterwood House, {{in the village}} of Canton, near Port Hope, Ontario. For his service to the Crown, he was awarded from the Queen the Royal Victorian Chain, making him the second non-royal or non-head of state, the first Canadian, and one of the only two Canadians to have ever received the honour. Just prior {{to the end of his}} time as governor general, the Queen wrote to Massey: [...] "I wish to send you my congratulations and my sincere thanks for the manner in which you have discharged [...] duties. I know that as my personal representative you have always sought to maintain the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> you for this because I regard it as the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction." [...] The Queen had wanted to appoint Massey as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, after consulting the rest of Cabinet, advised the Queen against conferring the honour.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2016, {{a planned}} concert in London was {{cancelled}} due to travel restrictions {{imposed on the}} artist, while other European dates suffered the same fate. On October 14, 2016, Yasiin Bey posted a video to Facebook where he announced that he's still planning to retire: [...] "I'm retiring for real this year, this week. With the 17th anniversary of Black on Both Sides being released, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> have had the career that I {{have been able to}} enjoy." [...] He also announced one last concert which he will be live streaming from Cape Town, South Africa. In November 2016, he was granted the ability to leave but not reenter South Africa and was put on [...] "South Africa's 'undesirable persons' list." [...] He said he would perform one show in Harlem and three in Washington D.C. after leaving South Africa. He announced Dec 99th, his final album would be released on December 9. He released three singles from it [...] “Local Time,” [...] “N.A.W.” and “Seaside Panic Room.” On December 5, 2016, he announced the title of two albums, Negus in Natural Person and As Promised, the latter of which is a collaboration with Southern hip hop producer Mannie Fresh, initially titled OMFGOD. His claims of retirement seem questionable as he has played a show as recently as Wednesday September 13, 2017, at the Fox Theater in Oakland as part of Black Star.|$|E
