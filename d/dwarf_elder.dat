On the land, near to the water, upon the hillsides, {{everything}} is so closely planted one to another, that you think they must choke one another,--vineyards, maize, mulberry-trees, apples, pears, quinces, and nuts. The <b>dwarf</b> <b>elder</b> throws itself vigorously over the walls. Ivy grows with strong stems up the rocks, and spreads itself wide over them, the lizard glides through the intervals, and everything that wanders to and fro reminds one of the loveliest pictures of art. The women's tufts of hair bound up, the men's bare breasts and light jackets, the excellent oxen which they drive home from market, the little asses with their loads,--everything forms a living, animated Heinrich Roos. And {{now that it is}} evening, in the mild air a few clouds rest upon the mountains, in the heavens more stand still than move, and immediately after sunset the chirping of crickets begins to grow more loud; then one feels for once at home in the world, and not as concealed or in exile. I am contented as though I had been born and brought up here, and were now returning from a Greenland or whaling voyage. Even the dust of my Fatherland, which is often whirled about the wagon, and which for so long a time I had not seen, is greeted. The clock-and-bell jingling of the crickets is altogether lovely, penetrating, and agreeable. It sounds bravely when roguish boys whistle in emulation of a field of such songstresses. One fancies that they really enhance one another. Also the evening is perfectly mild as the day." ...|$|E

40|$|Sambucus ebulus L. (<b>dwarf</b> <b>elder)</b> is a {{medicinal}} plant, {{the usefulness}} of which also as food is restricted due to its toxicity. In the last few years, both the chemistry and pharmacology of Sambucus ebulus L. have been investigated. Among the structural and functional proteins present in the plant, sugar-binding proteins (lectins) with or without anti-ribosomal activity and single chain ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) have been isolated. RIPs are enzymes (E. C. 3. 2. 2. 22) that display N-glycosidase activity on the 28 S rRNA subunit, leading to the inhibition of protein synthesis by arresting the step of polypeptide chain elongation. The biological role of all these proteins is as yet unknown. The evidence suggests {{that they could be}} involved in the defense of the plant against predators and viruses or/and a nitrogen store, with an impact on the nutritional characteristics and food safety. In this mini-review we describe all the isoforms of ebulin that have to date been isolated from <b>dwarf</b> <b>elder,</b> as well as their functional characteristics and potential uses, whilst highlighting concern regarding ebulin toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Sambucus species {{contain a}} number of lectins with and without antiribosomal activity. Here, we show that <b>dwarf</b> <b>elder</b> (Sambucus ebulus L.) {{blossoms}} express two D-galactose-binding lectins that were isolated and purified by affinity chromatography and gel filtration. These proteins, which we named ebulin blo (A-B toxin) and SELblo (B-B lectin) —blo from blossoms—were subjected to molecular characterization and analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and tryptic peptide fingerprinting. Both lectins share {{a high degree of}} amino acid sequence homology with Sambucus lectins related to the Sam n 1 allergen. Ebulin blo, but not SELblo, was highly toxic by nasal instillation to mice. Overall, our results suggested that both lectins would belong to an allergen family exemplified by Sam n 1 and could trigger allergy responses. Furthermore, they raise a concern about ebulin blo toxicity...|$|E

After dyeing procedure, the samples were treated with three different fixing agents. Finally, the effect of plasma pre-treatment and microwave energy, and type of fixing agent as a dyeing procedure on colour fastness to light, rubbing and washing and also the colour strength of the samples were investigated. According to the results, the increase on plasma treatment time and microwave energy increased the colour strength of samples. The fixing agent treatment did not affect much as the colour fastness properties of dyed samples...|$|E

40|$|All {{parts of}} <b>dwarf</b> <b>elder</b> (Sambucus ebulus L.) studied so far contain a ribosome-inactivating protein with lectin {{activity}} (ribosome-inactivating lectin; RIL), known as ebulin. Green fruits contain ebulin f, the toxicity {{of which has}} been studied in six-week-old mice, where {{it was found that the}} intestines were primary targets for it when administered intraperitoneally (i. p.). We performed experiments to assess whether ebulin f administration to six- and 12 -month-old mice would trigger higher toxicity than that displayed in six-week-old mice. In the present report, we present evidence indicating that the toxicological effects of ebulin f after its i. p. administration to elderly mice are exerted on the lungs and intestines by an increased rate of apoptosis. We hypothesize that the ebulin f apoptosis-promoting action together with the age-dependent high rate of apoptosis result in an increase in the lectin’s toxicity, leading to a higher lethality level...|$|E
40|$|The pollen grains have a {{definite}} shape, size, colour, structure for each species, genus {{and family and}} these characters are useful for systematical botany. The pollen has nutritive properties due to its content: proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, hormones and minerals. In the Romanian flora vegetate three species of Sambucus, but only S. nigra L. (elder or black elder) supplies a vegetal medical product, Sambuci flos or elder flowers, whereas the others species S. ebulus L. (<b>dwarf</b> <b>elder)</b> and S. racemosa L. (mountain elder or red elder) are considered adulterations. The pollen of Sambucus species were already studied using optical microscopy (Tarnavschi et al.), but the images are in one single layout, therefore the structure details cannot be easily notice. In this context the pollen grains of the three species already mentioned above were studied by SEM (Scanning Electron Microscopy). The results demonstrated that this pollen have a small-middle size, oblat-sphaeroidal-prolat shape, threecolpat and the exine adornments are of reticulate type, haemitectate with sticks in the meshs of polygonale net. The flavonoids content is lower than in others species (0. 146 - 0. 564 %). The SEM analyse of Sambucus pollen allow a reliable identification of the genus but less for the species...|$|E
40|$|Sambucus (Adoxaceae) {{species have}} been used for both food and {{medicine}} purposes. Among these, Sambucus nigra L. (black elder), Sambucus ebulus L. (<b>dwarf</b> <b>elder),</b> and Sambucus sieboldiana L. are the most relevant species studied. Their use has been somewhat restricted due to the presence of bioactive proteins or/and low molecular weight compounds whose ingestion could trigger deleterious effects. Over the last few years, the chemical and pharmacological characteristics of Sambucus {{species have been}} investigated. Among the proteins present in Sambucus species both type 1, and type 2 ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs), and hololectins have been reported. The biological role played by these proteins remains unknown, although they are conjectured to be involved in defending plants against insect predators and viruses. These proteins might have an important impact on the nutritional characteristics and food safety of elderberries. Type 2 RIPs are able to interact with gut cells of insects and mammals triggering a number of specific and mostly unknown cell signals in the gut mucosa that could significantly affect animal physiology. In this paper, we describe all known RIPs that have been isolated to date from Sambucus species, and comment on their antiviral and entomotoxic effects, as well as their potential uses...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAim of the studyThe {{performed}} investigations aimed on {{the identification}} of the anti-inflammatory principal of extracts of leaves of Sambucus ebulus L. (<b>dwarf</b> <b>elder)</b> in order to rationalize the traditional use of this plant for the treatment of chronically inflammatory diseases. Materials and methodsDwarf elder leaf extract was subjected to activity guided fractionation using inhibition of TNFα induced expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM- 1) on the surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) as monitoring tool (positive control: parthenolide 10 μM, VCAM- 1 expression (% of control) : 5. 35 ± 0. 38 %). ResultsBio-guided isolation resulted in identification of ursolic acid as anti-inflammatory principal. Besides its inhibitory effects against TNFα induced expression of VCAM- 1 (IC 50 6. 25 μM), ursolic acid inhibits also TNFα induced expression of ICAM- 1 (IC 50 value between 3. 13 and 6. 25 μM) (positive control: parthenolide 10 μM, ICAM- 1 expression (% of control) : 38. 89 ± 16. 6 %). Toxic effects of ursolic acid on HUVECs can be drastically reduced using an enriched extract instead of the pure compound. ConclusionsOur findings suggest an additional mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of ursolic acid by demonstrating its ability to inhibit TNFα-stimulated expression of VCAM- 1 and ICAM- 1 and support the traditional use of extracts and preparations of Sambucus ebulus L., rich in ursolic acid, for the treatment of chronically inflammatory processes...|$|E
40|$|Elderberries {{are quite}} edible. The blue or purple berries are {{gathered}} and made into elderberry wine, jam, syrup, and pies. The entire flower cluster can be dipped in batter and fried while petals can be eaten raw or {{made into a}} fragrant and tasty tea. The flowers add an aromatic flavor and lightness to pancakes or fritters. The elderberry is of well-known value to the Indians of North America and the many purposes it serves (Barrow 1967). Elderberry is highly prized by both Spaniards and Cahuillas. Throughout the months of July and August the small clusters of berries are gathered in large quantities. These clusters are dried carefully on the drying floor and preserved in considerable amounts. When wanted, they are cooked into a rich sauce that needs no sweetening. A Cahuilla family during this season of the year will subsist largely on these messes of "sauco. " Frequently, the elderberry was so greatly enjoyed that families would live for weeks on little else. Many were dried {{for use in the}} winter, and were either recooked or eaten raw. Elderberries are still highly prized for food by modern Indian people. Alternate Names Arizona elderberry, American elder, sweet elder, wild elder, flor sauco, tree of music, Danewort, Walewort, New Mexican elderberry, velvet-leaf elder, hairy blue elderberry, and <b>dwarf</b> <b>elder.</b> Taxonomically, there have been recent changes in this elderberry species. It was previously divided into Sambucus coriacea, Sambucus orbiculata, Sambucus velutina, and Sambucus caerulea (Munz 1968). This species is known in some floras as Sambucus mexicana...|$|E
