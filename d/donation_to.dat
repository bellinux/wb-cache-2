40|$|Using household-level data, {{we explore}} the {{relationship}} between <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> {{the victims of the}} 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and other charitable donations. The empirical evidence suggests that donations specifically for the victims of the tsunami are positively associated with the amount previously donated to other charitable causes, which accords with complementary rather than substitution effects. This relationship exists when we decompose overall charitable donations into different types of philanthropy, with charitable contributions to caring, needy and religious organizations having the largest positive association with <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> the victims of the tsunami. When we explore the impact of <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> the victims of the tsunami on future <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> charity, however, our findings suggest an inverse relationship with the largest inverse association with <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> needy and caring organizations. ...|$|R
40|$|We extend past {{research}} on the congruency between moral foundations and morally relevant outcomes to ingroup- and outgroup-focused charitable giving. We measured intentions to donate to outgroup members (begging EU-migrants) and self-reported <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> ingroup (medical research) and outgroup (international aid) charity organizations in a heterogeneous sample (N = 1008) and actual <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> ingroup (cancer treatment) and outgroup (hunger relief) organizations in two experimental studies (N = 126; N = 200). Individualizing intuitions predicted helping in general across self-report and behavioral data. Binding intuitions predicted higher <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> ingroup causes, lower <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> outgroup causes, and less intentions to donate to outgroup members in the self-report data, and they predicted lower donations overall in the behavioral data...|$|R

5|$|After the storm, local Red Cross volunteers {{provided}} {{meals and}} clothing {{to thousands of}} storm victims. The government allocated $5.1million (Trinidad and Tobago dollars) for relief work, to be coordinated by the National Emergency Relief Organization of Trinidad and Tobago, which was established following the damaging Hurricane Flora in 1963. This helped rebuild damage houses, clear roads, and assist affected farmers. The United States Agency for International Development sent about $5,000 (USD) in assistance, after the country's ambassador sent a formal request to Washington, D.C. The Amoco oil company also sent a $500 (USD) <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> the country's Red Cross.|$|E
5|$|After this feat {{that earned}} him fame and glory, in 1262 Alexios was {{appointed}} again to lead an army against Epirus. Here, however, he was defeated and captured by Nikephoros Doukas, who {{sent him to}} Manfred in Italy. He was ransomed in 1265 in exchange for Constance II of Hohenstaufen, widow of John Vatatzes. He is last mentioned in a document from December 1270 in which he made a <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> the Makrinitissa Monastery near Volos, and died sometime between 1271 and 1275, probably at Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, asserting that the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E
40|$|We {{develop a}} model where people {{differ in their}} altruistic {{preferences}} and can serve the public interest in two ways: by making <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> charity and by taking a public service job and exerting effort on the job. Our theory predicts {{that people who are}} more altruistic are more likely to take a public service job and, for a given job, make higher <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> charity. Comparing equally altruistic workers, those with a regular job make higher <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> charity than those with a public service job by a simple substitution argument. We subsequently test these predictions using the German Socio-Economic Panel Study, which contains data on self-reported altruism, sector of employment, and <b>donations</b> <b>to</b> charity for more than 7, 500 workers. We find support for most of our predictions...|$|R

5|$|Heskey {{was linked}} with a £12million move to Tottenham in December 2002, but Houllier insisted {{he was a}} part of his {{long-term}} plans and he remained at Liverpool.

The 2002–03 season saw him score 9 goals in 51 appearances for Liverpool and received criticism for his low goal to game ratio, with Houllier claiming that his future at the club was safe.|$|E

In the end, the removal was not proceeded with, and Mr Benham allowed the <b>donation</b> <b>to</b> remain with the Thelnetham Mill Preservation Trust.

5|$|The castle {{remained}} {{the property of}} the Clarendons until 1937, when Lord Clarendon found the maintenance of the castle too expensive and sold Kenilworth to the industrialist Sir John Siddeley.

In 1958 his son gave the castle itself to the town of Kenilworth and English Heritage has managed the property since 1984.
