500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} {{to a total}} of 944 theatres, with an extra 66 being added later. In its opening weekend, the film grossed $2.5million ($ in [...] dollars), becoming the tenth highest-grossing film of that week. The next week it had a 60% decline in sales. The film grossed a total of $7.3million ($ in [...] dollars) worldwide, and was a box office bomb. It was placed at 97 on the top 100 movies of 1987 list. Morton noted that although [...] "Madonna's comic talent was acknowledged, cinemagoers in the United States stayed away in droves." [...] The film was better accepted in the foreign released territories, prompting Madonna to defend herself, rather weakly, that her ideas were better accepted in Europe and Japan, rather than her home country. She added, [...] "I think the movie did badly in America because I upstaged it with my tour. People were confused about the connection between the record, the tour and the movie because they all had the same title. I also think there are people who don't want me to do well in both fields. I had to really fight to get any respect from the music business and now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>there</b> are some people who feel that I ought to be grateful for that respect and stick to music." [...] Nevertheless, Warner Bros. decided to release the film in home media in VHS on November 11, 1987, a decision not approved by Madonna.|$|E

I thought I had the only copy, but <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>there</b> might have been another one made." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often these {{comparisons}} carried {{hints of}} humor, competitiveness, or both. The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal, for example, termed Gage [...] "the patient whose cerebral organism had been comparatively so little disturbed by its abrupt and intrusive visitor"; and a Kentucky doctor, reporting a patient's survival of a gunshot through the nose, bragged, [...] "If you Yankees {{can send a}} tamping bar through a fellow's brain and not kill him, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>there</b> are not many can shoot a bullet between a man's mouth and his brains, stopping {{just short of the}} medulla oblongata, and not touch either." ...|$|E
