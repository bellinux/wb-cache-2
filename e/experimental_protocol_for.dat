30|$|It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that entrained and synchronized circadian rhythms better prepare the physiology {{of an individual}} to anticipate normal cycles of energy demand in order to optimize adaptive regulation [93]. This ‘self-adaptation’ behavior {{is transformed into a}} ‘self-defense’ response during stress [31], explaining results from different studies. Thus, pro-inflammatory cytokines shut down melatonin's nocturnal surge in the acute phase, whereas exacerbated or chronic inflammation upregulates pineal production through anti-inflammatory mediators, such as corticosteroids [36, 38]. However, {{there is a lot of}} heterogeneity in different studies due to interspecies differences or time and severity of inflammatory insult, prompting a standardization of <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols</b> <b>for</b> translating results in the ICU setting.|$|R
