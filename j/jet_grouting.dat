In the paper, it is argued that such an approach cannot be but probabilistic or semi-probabilistic. Based on published experimental data and statistical analysis of diameter and centroid position along the axis of <b>jet</b> <b>grouted</b> columns, in the paper a series of Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to find the influence of possible defects within the column in the umbrella static performance, with reference to two extreme subsoil conditions, that is clay and sand. Geometrical considerations on the minimum overlapping among columns necessary for continuity on the whole span of the umbrella are first drawn. It is shown that, due to defects, the real shape of <b>jet</b> <b>grouted</b> umbrellas is not that of a regular frustum of cone, and overlapping decreases along the span. There is a critical length after which structural continuity is difficult to obtain, depending on the statistical characteristics of the jet columns. Defects in axis orientation play the major role on this critical length. Static conditions are also analysed, assuming a simplified 2 D arch scheme, with reference to the part of umbrella in which continuity is guaranteed with the assumed level of confidence (95 %). The minimum average thickness of the <b>jet</b> <b>grouted</b> umbrella necessary for equilibrium is than found, which of course increases as the umbrella opens up along its axis.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effect}} of length of <b>jet</b> <b>grouted</b> columns and varying soil profile under shallow {{foundations}} of buildings constructed on the liquefiable ground was studied. The isolated shallow footing pad which supports a typical simple frame structure was constructed on the liquefiable ground. This ground was reinforced with <b>jet</b> <b>grouted</b> column rows under the shallow foundations of structure. The system was modeled as plane-strain using the FLAC 2 D (Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua) dynamic modelling and analysis code.

The results show that liquefaction-induced large settlements of shallow foundation of building decrease to tolerable limits with the increase in the length of columns. For soil profiles, with a relatively thinner liquefiable layer, a certain minimum length of columns (extended in base non liquefiable layer) is required to meet the settlement tolerable limits. For soil profiles, with a relatively thicker liquefiable layer, this length should be equal to the thickness of the liquefiable layer from the footing base plus some extension in the base non liquefiable dense layer. In the soil profile with the base liquefiable layer underlying the non liquefiable layer, settlements could not be reduced to the tolerable limits even with columns of relatively larger length which may be critical...|$|R

To quantify the mechanical effects of variability on the characteristic strength {{and the effects of}} the samples dimensions, the random and spatial variation are firstly explored interpreting field and laboratory tests with the Random Field theory. Then the variability is reproduced on a large volume of material together with the imaginary coring of samples of different sizes and with uniaxial compression testing. This calculation enables to relate the statistical parameters of strength to the size of samples, to the variability observed at small scale and to the correlation distance.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} design {{procedure for}} <b>jet</b> <b>grouted</b> bottom sealing barriers of open excavations under ground water level is {{shown on the}} basis of geometrical considerations on the true shape of the columns, which are far from being vertical perfect cylinders. By considering a square grid disposition of the columns axes, and taking into account the possible defects of the columns (verticality and diameter) assuming typical statistical parameters of their distributions taken from field trial measurements carried out by the authors, a Monte Carlo procedure is used to get some simple design charts for a given risk level. The analyses have been carried out for different values of column mean diameters Dm and length, as well as for different spacing between columns s. It is shown that columns overlapping decreases with depth because of defects, the deviation form verticality being the most critical one. The true minimum thickness of the barrier is smaller than the ideal one, resulting into lower uplift safety factors. For a given value of the ratio s/Dm, larger columns are more effective. In the paper, it is argued that a cost effective design may be obtained by associating safety and economical considerations via the proposed probabilistic charts...|$|R

The tests {{were performed to}} measure the ability of <b>jets</b> of <b>grout</b> slurry to mobilize and mix simulated tank sludge. The technique is intended for in situ immobilization of tank waste heels. The current approach uses a single, rotated, larger-diameter nozzle driven at lower pressure. Due to the larger diameter, the potential for plugging is reduced and the effective radius around an injection point over which the jet is effective in mobilizing sludge from the tank bottom can be made larger. A total of three grout injection tests were conducted in a 9 -ft diameter tank. In each case, a 2 -in. layer of kaolin clay paste was placed on a dry tank floor to simulate a sludge heel.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the effort was to develop and demonstrate an integrated methodology and field system to evaluate the integrity of in situ, impermeable barriers constructed in the vadose zone. An autonomous, remotely accessible, automatic monitoring and analysis system was designed and fabricated. It was thoroughly tested under field conditions, {{and was able to}} function as designed throughout the test period. Data inversion software was developed with enhanced capabilities over the previous prototype version, and integrated with the monitoring system for real time operation. Analytical simulations were performed to determine the inversion code's sensitivity to model parameters. Numerical simulations were performed to better understand how typical field conditions differ from the ideal model(s) which are used (or have been developed for use) in the inversion code and to further validate the flux limited forward model developed for use with the system. Results from the analytical and numerical assessment of the inversion code showed that the SEAtrace{trademark} approach could locate leaks within 0. 4 to 1. 2 m. Leak size determination was less accurate, but produced results within a factor of 3 to 8 for leaks in the 2. 5 to 10 cm diameter range. The smallest engineered leak in the test 1. 1 cm diameter, could be located but its size estimate was high by a factor of 30. Data analysis was performed automatically after each gas scan was completed, yielding results in less than thirty minutes, although the bulk of the results reported required post test data analysis to remove effects of high background concentrations. The field test of the integrated system was problematic, primarily due to unanticipated, unintentional leaks formed in the impermeable liner. The test facility constructed to proof the system was ambitious, initially having 11 engineered leaks of various dimensions that could be independently operated. While a great deal of care went into the construction of the facility to assure there would be no undesired leaks, the primary barrier to diffusion (a 30 -mil high density polyethylene membrane) failed. The unanticipated leaks were large enough that tracer gas diffusing from them masked the designed leaks. The test facility was re-excavated and a new membrane installed. Initial tests of this barrier showed that it also leaked {{near the bottom of the}} barrier. However, careful control of the subsequent tracer gas injections, coupled with extensive data analysis to minimize the effects of the high background tracer gas concentrations, allowed leak characterization to be completed successfully.

40|$|Deep {{excavations}} in soft clay with {{an underlying}} aquifer lead to major concerns of ground deformation, soil-structure interaction and base instability due to hydraulic uplift. Given {{vast amount of}} case histories reported in the literature, it is still difficult to differentiate and understand ground deformations induced by excavations in densely built urban areas and greenfield sites. Moreover, reliable measurements of earth pressure on walls in excavations in soft clay are rarely reported. In spite of frequently reported base instabilities due to hydraulic uplift, the initiation and failure mechanism of base instability are not systematically investigated and well understood. Existing calculation methods against base instability may be too conservative and deserved to be improved. This research aims at investigating ground deformation, soil-structure interaction and base instability of deep excavation in soft clay subjected to hydraulic uplift. Three methodologies, namely field monitoring, centrifuge modelling and finite element analysis, are adopted. To study ground deformation and soil-structure interaction, a diaphragm wall panel constructed at a greenfield site in Shanghai soft clay was comprehensively instrumented and monitored. Coupled-consolidation finite element analysis was conducted to back-analyse the case history. Moreover, a parametric study was carried out to investigate, understand and quantify key factors governing relatively small excavation-induced ground deformation in Shanghai. To study base instability due to hydraulic uplift, a new experimental setup was developed to simulate in-flight multi-propped excavation de-stabilised by hydraulic uplift in centrifuge. Centrifuge model tests and three-dimensional coupled-consolidation finite element analyses were carried out to investigate the initiation and failure mechanism of base instability due to hydraulic uplift in soft clay and effectiveness of using ‘anti-uplift piles’ for base stabilisation. Together with dimensional analysis and numerical parametric studies, key variables affecting the initiation and failure mechanism of base instability are indentified. In the instrumented greenfield site, both magnitude and influence zone of ground settlements are about 20 % larger than those in densely built areas in Shanghai. Numerical analyses reveal that a key factor affecting excavation-induced ground deformation in Shanghai is <b>jet</b> <b>grouted</b> prop, which reduces ground deformation by providing passive resistance and hence decreasing soil yielding {{in front of the}} wall. It is found that the initiation and failure mechanism of base instability due to hydraulic uplift is mainly governed by a ratio of excavation width over the thickness of soft clay inside excavation (B/D). As an excavation becomes narrower (i. e., B/D decreases), the hydraulic pressure (Pi) required to initiate uplift movement of clay inside excavation increases significantly, due to increased effect of downward shear stress acting along soil-wall interface on basal resistance. Compared to the effect of B/D, effect of undrained shear strength of clay (cu) on Pi is much less significant. At basal failure, the dominant failure mode changes from simple shear in relatively narrow excavations (i. e., B/D 3). A new calculation chart is developed for estimating Pi of excavations with varied B/D and cu accordingly. Installaton of ‘anti-uplift piles’ inside excavation does not alter Pi, but can reduce uplift movement by 80 %, by mobilising cu along soil-pile interface...|$|R

The scope testing explored the rheology of the proposed jetting slurries and the settling properties of the proposed grouts using sand-water mixes for the wet sludge. After establishing a <b>jetting</b> slurry and <b>grout</b> with an acceptable rheology and settling properties, the proposed in situ grout formulation was subjected to sensitivity testing for variations in the formulation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe “Terreiro do Trigo” dockyard, at the “Jardim do Tabaco”, {{was filled}} {{in order to}} allow the {{construction}} of the new “Santa Apolónia” Cruise Terminal in Lisbon, at the Tagus River right bank. A load transfer platform (LTP), founded over <b>jet</b> <b>grouting</b> columns, allowed the construction of a 4, 2 m height embankment, placed over a soft muddy alluvium layer (undrained shear stress lesser than 20 kPa) with about 20 m of average thickness. Vertical full scale load tests were performed in order to assess the possibility to incorporate the <b>jet</b> <b>grouting</b> columns, reinforced with steel micropiles, as foundation solution for the new Cruise Terminal building. The design criteria of the <b>jet</b> <b>grouting</b> columns, including the quality control and quality assurance, are presented, as well as the main results of the adopted monitoring and survey plan. The main results of the full scale load tests are pointed out. Finally, the technical and economic advantages of the adopted solutions, comparing with some more conventional ones, are presented...|$|E
