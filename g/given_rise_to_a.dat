5|$|Both sexes are {{territorial}} on {{the breeding}} grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas. Pairs {{stay in their}} territory throughout the year where the climate is sufficiently temperate.

5|$|In July 1943, a plane {{carrying}} Sikorski {{plunged into}} the sea immediately after takeoff from Gibraltar, killing all on board except the pilot. The exact circumstances of Sikorski's death have been disputed and have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of different theories surrounding the crash and his death. Sikorski {{had been the most}} prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause.|$|E

5|$|Carroll Baker {{was born}} and raised in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in a Roman Catholic family, the {{daughter}} of Edith Gertrude (née Duffy) and William Watson Baker, who was a traveling salesman. She is of Polish descent, which has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> rumor that her birth name was Karolina Piekarski. However, this currently cannot be substantiated by known records. Baker's parents separated when she was eight years old, and she moved with her mother and younger sister, Virginia, to Turtle Creek, Pennsylvania. According to Baker, her mother struggled as a single parent, and the family was poor for much of her upbringing.|$|E
5|$|The {{baseline}} A320 has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{family of}} aircraft which {{share a common}} design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318, to 220, on the A321. They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, {{all have the same}} pilot type rating. Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military version like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the world's largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.|$|E

We complement this invariant by another type of graph invariants, coming from viewing graphs as quadratic forms over the integers.

5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure {{to produce a}} formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses {{a specific type of}} strain to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E
5|$|The diverse ethno-linguistic {{groups of}} Tripura have <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{composite}} culture. The dominant ethnic groups are Bengali, Tripuri (Debbarma, Tripura, Jamatia, Reang, Noatia, Koloi, Murasing, Chakma, Halam, Garo, Kuki, Mizo, Uchoi, Dhamai, Roaza, Mogh, Manipuri, and other tribal {{groups such as}} Munda, Oraon and Santhal who migrated in Tripura as a tea labourers. Bengali people represent the largest ethno-linguist community of the state. Bengali culture, as a result, is the main indigenous, non-Tripura culture. Indeed, many elite tribal families which reside in towns have actively embraced Bengali culture and language in the past, but in today's generation more Tripuris are embracing their culture. The Tripuri kings were great patrons of Bengali culture, especially literature; Bengali language was {{the language of the}} court. Elements of Bengali culture, such as Bengali literature, Bengali music, and Bengali cuisine are widespread, particularly in the urban areas of the state.|$|E

25|$|Christer Pettersson, who {{previously}} {{had been convicted}} of manslaughter, was convicted of the murder in 1988 after having been identified as the killer by Palme's wife. However, on appeal to Svea Court of Appeal he was acquitted. A petition for a new trial, filed by the prosecutor, was denied by the Supreme Court of Sweden. Pettersson died in late-September 2004, legally declared not guilty of the Palme assassination. The case remains unsolved and has <b>given</b> <b>rise</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> number of conspiracy theories.|$|E
