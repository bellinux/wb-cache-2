25|$|With {{the end of}} the Peninsular War in 1814, {{the courts}} of Europe demanded that Queen Maria I and Prince Regent João return to Portugal, deeming it unfit for the head of an ancient European monarchy to reside in a colony. In 1815, in order to justify {{continuing}} to live in Brazil, where the royal court had thrived <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>years,</b> the Crown established the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, thus creating a pluricontinental transatlantic monarchic state. However, such a ploy didn't last long, since the leadership in Portugal, resentful of the new status of its larger colony, continued to require the return of court to Lisbon (as postulated by the Liberal Revolution of 1820), and also groups of Brazilians, impatient for practical and real changes, still demanded independence and a republic, as demonstrated by the 1817 Pernambucan Revolt.|$|E

500|$|Borah's legal {{practice}} {{had made him}} prominent in southern Idaho, and in 1902 he sought election to the Senate. By this time, a united Republican Party was deemed likely to defeat the Democratic/Populist combine that had ruled Idaho <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>years.</b> The 1902 Idaho state Republican convention showed that Borah had, likely, the most support among the people, but the choice of senator was generally dictated by the caucus of the majority party in the legislature. In the 1902 election, Republicans retook control, electing a governor of their party, {{as well as the}} state's only House member and a large majority in the legislature. [...] There were three other Republicans seeking the Senate seat, including Weldon B. Heyburn, a mining lawyer from {{the northern part of the}} state. When the legislature met in early 1903, Borah led on early caucus ballots, but then the other candidates withdrew and backed Heyburn, who was chosen by the caucus, and then by the legislature. There were many rumors of corruption in the choice of Heyburn, and Borah determined that the defeat would not end his political career, deciding to seek the seat of Senator Dubois (by then a Democrat) when it was filled by the legislature in early 1907.|$|E

2500|$|Spain in {{particular}} receives {{most of the}} immigrants coming illegally to Europe from Africa, probably due to its large coastal area and its proximity to and land borders with Morocco at Ceuta and Melilla; African immigrants try to enter the country by boat from Morocco or Senegal or by jumping the border fences. [...] For example, during just the first weekend of September 2006, more than 1,300 illegal immigrants arrived on beaches in the Canary Islands and estimates are that between 50,000 and 70,000 people enter the European Union illegally through Spanish borders or beaches. Border fences have been built at both the Ceuta and Melilla borders {{in an attempt to}} stop illegal entrance to the country. Illegal immigration is an issue in Spanish politics, and also a big human rights problem, since many people die during the journey. Spain has been Europe's largest absorber of migrants <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>years,</b> with its immigrant population increasing fourfold as 2.8million people have arrived, mostly from Latin America. Spectacular growth in Spain's immigrant population came as the country's economy created {{more than half of all}} the new jobs in the European Union between 2001 and 2006.|$|E
