5|$|The {{agreements}} with Spanish authorities allowed only airlines {{from the country}} of origin or from Spain to fly charter <b>flights.</b> But because of the SAS-cooperation, an agreement was made where any Scandinavian airline could fly to Spain {{from any of the}} three Scandinavian countries. Domestically, Braathens SAFE received strong competition from Sterling Airways, {{but on the other hand}} this allowed Braathens SAFE to fly charter <b>flights</b> from Sweden. In 1968, the large Swedish–Danish charter airline Internord went bankrupt, giving Braathens SAFE increased charter traffic. The company also started purchasing a larger share of Altas Resor, until it took over all the whole company in 1978. In Sweden, Braathens SAFE used its partners to sell charter <b>flights</b> to Norway, and then continue their <b>flights</b> using scheduled <b>flights.</b> Braathens SAFE was hindered by the charter regulations from making intercontinental <b>flights,</b> as well as <b>flights</b> between the Scandinavian capitals.

50|$|Steady <b>flight,</b> unaccelerated <b>flight,</b> or {{equilibrium}} <b>flight</b> is {{a special}} case in <b>flight</b> dynamics where the aircraft's linear and angular velocity are constant in a body-fixed reference frame. Basic aircraft maneuvers such as level <b>flight,</b> climbs and descents, and coordinated turns can be modeled as steady <b>flight</b> maneuvers. Typical aircraft <b>flight</b> consists {{of a series of}} steady <b>flight</b> maneuvers connected by brief, accelerated transitions. Because of this, primary applications of steady <b>flight</b> models include aircraft design, assessment of aircraft performance, <b>flight</b> planning, and using steady <b>flight</b> states as the equilibrium conditions around which <b>flight</b> dynamics equations are expanded.|$|R

5|$|As well as {{transport}} operations, the Hercules flew many evacuation <b>flights</b> out of Vietnam {{to transfer}} wounded or sick personnel to Australia, via Butterworth, for further treatment. These <b>flights</b> were initially conducted {{as part of}} the regular courier service, and the patients and RAAF nurses had to endure uncomfortable conditions as the aircraft had only rudimentary facilities for personnel on stretchers. Separate evacuation <b>flights</b> began on 1July 1966, and continued at fortnightly intervals until 1972; more <b>flights</b> were made during periods in which 1ATF suffered heavy casualties. Although the operation was generally successful, only C-130Es were assigned to this task from May 1967 after an article criticising the use of noisy C-130As to transport wounded personnel was published in The Medical Journal of Australia. The C-130Es provided much more comfortable conditions and were capable of flying directly between South Vietnam and Australia when required. A total of 3,164patients had been transported to Australia by the time the C-130 evacuation <b>flights</b> ended in early 1972. The Hercules also returned the bodies of servicemen killed in Vietnam to Australia.|$|E
