25|$|Like {{many others}} who devoted their life to {{commercial}} art {{in the first half}} of the 20th century, Denis McLoughlin was never paid a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> his work. Many pieces of his artwork, the Boardman book covers in particular, which Denis had been promised would be returned to him, were either lost or ended up in private collections. While he made a living, Denis never accumulated much money. Although he had a pension from the British government, he was forced to augment his income by working long past retirement age. He once commented that he never particularly liked illustrating military topics and yet that is what he found himself doing for the last 20 years of his life. Perhaps, had he been given cowboy stories to illustrate, he might have been happier.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{previous}} games, Duke can only hold two weapons {{at any one}} time, {{in a manner similar}} to the Halo series, although pipe bombs and laser tripwires are considered inventory items and as such are not limited by this restriction. The PC version allows Duke to hold four weapons in the single-player campaign. Items that have an effect on Duke can be picked up by the player; these items are steroids, beer, and the holoduke. Steroids increase the strength of Duke's melee attacks by a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> a limited time. Beer makes Duke much more resistant to damage, but blurs the screen. The holoduke creates a hologram of Duke Nukem that looks and acts in a very similar way to Duke, but often says slightly twisted versions of his one-liners. Whilst the holoduke is in effect, Duke becomes invisible and the AI characters do not recognize his presence. The jetpack also returns, but only in multiplayer.|$|E

500|$|After signing Jordan, Falk quickly {{made the}} first <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> him: the Nike shoe deal. At {{the start of the}} 80s, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had a six-figure shoe deal for $100,000 (with Adidas), and Nike was a small player next to {{companies}} like Converse, which had virtually owned the market on basketball shoes through the 1970s. [...] After James Worthy signed an 8-year, $1.2 million endorsement deal with New Balance in 1982, also negotiated by Falk, Falk decided to make large demands to shoe companies for Jordan's services, including his own shoe line and a royalty.|$|E
500|$|Before Brian Epstein {{took the}} Beatles on, Mona Best had been {{handling}} {{most of the}} management and promotional work. According to promoter and manager Joe Flannery, Mona had done a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> the band by arranging {{a number of important}} early gigs and lending them a badly needed helping hand when they returned from Hamburg the first time, but this came at the cost of having to contend with her overbearing nature. At this crucial {{time in the history of}} the Beatles, John Lennon confided to Flannery that he considered Mona [...] "bossy like [...] Mimi" [...] and believed that she was using the Beatles only for the sake of her son, though this should be weighed against the fact that the Beatles' cordial relations with Mona would soon resume. She often met them while visiting Neil Aspinall at his London home. On these occasions, the Beatles often had small gifts for her which they had acquired on their travels. For her part, Mona allowed them to use her father's military medals in the photo shoot for the Sgt. Pepper album cover.|$|E
500|$|Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix {{received}} [...] "generally favorable" [...] reviews, {{according to}} video game review aggregator Metacritic. Game Informer praised the collection, praising the upgrades to Kingdom Hearts II, {{the transition of}} Birth By Sleep from the PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3, and criticizing the Re:coded movie as just being [...] "there for completionists and easy to ignore for everyone else." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly called the collection a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> fans of the series, praising the combat system and series charming characters, but noting the questionable overall narrative quality. GameTrailers noted the improved selection of games over the 1.5 Remix, extolling the inclusion {{of two of the}} Kingdom Hearts series best games in the collection, as well as previously Japan-only content such as special boss battles. They also praised the new music arrangements and the cinematic retelling of Re:coded, though this was not a universally shared opinion. IGN propounded the same points, noting the improved music, graphics, and [...] "high-level challenges", but criticized the aging controls from Kingdom Hearts II and the camera system in Birth by Sleep. Hardcore Gamer had more mixed views of the collection, noting that the games were not cutting edge graphically, particularly Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep Final Mix, but was still a major improvement.|$|E

500|$|This episode {{addresses}} {{the death of}} Dale Horvath, who is attacked and ripped open by a walker. Since writer Robert Kirkman felt that Dale epitomized a character of morality and humanity, much of [...] "Judge, Jury, Executioner" [...] explores themes related to the declining morality of individuals during a catastrophic event. Kirkman proclaimed that Dale's death was a momentous occasion, ultimately marking {{a turning point for}} future development of The Walking Dead. [...] "Dale's character has been {{the heart and soul of}} the show," [...] he iterated. [...] "He's definitely the moral compass. He’s the guy that, more so than anyone, has been warning people to be careful how you let this world change you and monitoring what lengths people are going to survive. His loss is going to mean a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> all the characters in the show and is definitely going to represent a turn to a darker space. His death means a lot." [...] Kirkman added that it was difficult to release DeMunn from the cast. He stated: [...] "It’s heartbreaking to lose Jeffrey DeMunn. He's really given us a lot, these last two seasons on the show. It's been amazing to work with him and get to know him and he’s an awesome dude and we’re definitely going to miss him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eurogamer's Kristan Reed {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 5 out of 10, arguing of the trust/fear system [...] "it {{is nowhere near}} {{as much of a}} neat {{gameplay}} innovation as the hype had some people believe [...] As a squad based game it would work far better if you ever had to care a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> anyone's survival. As it is, most of the team seem to split off once a level's over (or turn into aliens at pre-determined moments during it), so you're left merely using each NPC as a means of progression." [...] He was also critical of the graphics, which he argued [...] "look old school, with bad texturing, uninteresting particle effects, and vanilla architecture." [...] He concluded [...] "if you can pick up The Thing cheap you won't be too disappointed; it's by no means a bad game, but it's all the more disappointing thanks {{to the fact that it}} could and should have been brilliant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tzigara's {{contribution}} as an {{art historian}} has received mixed evaluations. According to Lucian Nastasă, his 1911 course at the Bucharest University was the first professional approach to the subject, after the [...] "somewhat organized" [...] attempts on Odobescu's part. Writing in 1920, art historian Gheorghe Oprescu also suggested that, with Nicolae Iorga's reviews, Tzigara's [...] "intelligent articles" [...] {{were the only ones}} in the Romanian press to properly educate the public taste. Charles Upson Clark also rated [...] "Tzigara-Samurcash" [...] as one of Romania's [...] "best-known modern writers" [...] in the field of archeology or ancient art, with Alexandru Lapedatu, George Murnu and Abgar Baltazar. Contrarily, a later assessment made by ethnologist Romulus Vulcănescu rated both Tzigara, Iorga and Oprescu as authors of [...] "ethnological essayistics and cultural microhistory", who lacked a global approach to folk art research. Dumitru Hîncu, writing in 2007, noted that, once [...] "a first-rate cultural figure", Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș [...] "no longer says a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> your average present-day reader".|$|E
2500|$|Washington {{then gave}} a short but impassioned speech, {{now known as}} the , {{counseling}} patience. [...] His message was that they should oppose anyone [...] "who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood." [...] He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. [...] He gazed upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said: [...] "Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country." [...] This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a <b>great</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. [...] Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. [...] He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. [...] Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution. [...] Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed [...] "unshaken confidence" [...] in Congress, and [...] "disdain" [...] and [...] "abhorrence" [...] for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week. Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters. [...] The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel Timothy Pickering, who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.|$|E
