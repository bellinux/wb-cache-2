The Council of Trent declares that at the hour of death there is no [...] "reservatio" [...] and that all priests can absolve [...] "in articulo mortis".

His opinions on the [...] "materia" [...] for sacramental absolution, and on the [...] "Copia confessariorum" [...] seem opposed to the teaching of the council on these points.|$|R
