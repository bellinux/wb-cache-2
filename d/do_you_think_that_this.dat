6000|$|... 2. When God giveth his {{presence}} to his people, that {{his presence}} causeth them {{to appear to}} themselves more what they are, than at other times, by all other light, they can see. [...] "O my lord," [...] said Daniel, [...] "by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me"; and why was that, but because by the glory of that vision, he saw his own vileness more than at other times. So again: [...] "I was left alone," [...] says he, [...] "and saw this great vision"; and what follows? Why, [...] "and there remained no strength in me; for my comeliness was turned into corruption, and I retained no strength" [...] (Dan 10:8,16). By the presence of God, when we have it indeed, even our best things, our comeliness, our sanctity and righteousness, all do immediately turn to corruption and polluted rags. The brightness of his glory dims them as the clear light of the shining sun puts out {{the glory of the}} fire or candle, and covers them with the shadow of death. See also the truth of this in that vision of the prophet Isaiah. [...] "Wo is me," [...] said he, [...] "for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell {{in the midst of a}} people of unclean lips." [...] Why, what is the matter? how came the prophet by this sight? Why, says he, [...] "mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts" [...] (Isa 6:5). But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> outcry was caused by unbelief? No; nor yet begotten by slavish fear. This was to him the vision of his Saviour, with whom also he had communion before (vv 2-5). It was the glory of that God with whom he had now to do, that turned, as was noted before of Daniel, his comeliness in him into corruption, and that gave him yet greater sense of the disproportion that was betwixt his God and him, and so a greater sight of his defiled and polluted nature.|$|E

Friends, I know not whether this thing be the more ludicrous or the more melancholy. It is quite unspeakably both. Suppose, instead of being now sent for by you, I had been sent for by some private gentleman, living in a suburban house, with his garden separated only by a fruit-wall from his next door neighbour's; and he had called me to consult with him on the furnishing of his drawing room. I begin looking about me, and find the walls rather bare; I think such and such a paper might be desirable--perhaps a little fresco here and there on the ceiling--a damask curtain or so at the windows. 'Ah,' says my employer, 'damask curtains, indeed! That's all very fine, but you know I can't afford that kind of thing just now!' 'Yet the world credits you with a splendid income!' 'Ah, yes,' says my friend, 'but do you know, at present, I am obliged to spend it nearly all in steel-traps?' 'Steel-traps! for whom?' 'Why, for that fellow on the other side the wall, you know: we're very good friends, capital friends; but we are obliged to keep our traps set {{on both sides of the}} wall; we could not possibly keep on friendly terms without them, and our spring guns. The worst of it is, we are both clever fellows enough; and there's never a day passes that we don't find out a new trap, or a new gun-barrel, or something; we spend about fifteen millions a year each in our traps, take it all together; and I don't see how we're to do with less.' A highly comic state of life for two private gentlemen! but for two nations, it seems to me, not wholly comic? Bedlam would be comic, perhaps, if there were only one madman in it; and your Christmas pantomime is comic, when there is only one clown in it; but when the whole world turns clown, and paints itself red with its own heart's blood instead of vermilion, it is something else than comic, I think.|$|E

Decolonizing Architecture {{is a master}} plan that explores the problems and potentiality associated with the reuse of Israeli colonial architecture after the ending of Israeli occupation and settlers evacuations. The project {{in which we are}} currently involved could be seen as an attempt to subvert the way control and security devices work. It’s about the reutilization and re-inhabitation of Israeli colonial architecture from the moment its connection with the political-military regime that keeps it alive ceases to exist. The idea is to establish a counter-laboratory of decolonization. We still insist on the use of this old-fashion term decolonization, aware of its problematic history, in order to designate a form of action that is part of a process that operates on many scales and keeps distance from the existing “solution oriented politics” of the “peace industry”. Decolonization allows us to designate a process aimed at the deactivation of control and security devices. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> notion of decolonization, in the sense we have articulated it, could be thought as a form of ‘profanation’?” Excerpt from the Book of Profanation 2009 in the same series as the Book of Returns.

We do this by {{counting the number of}} basic operations needed; since multiplication takes much more time to perform on a computer, we will count only multiplications. This paper addresses the following: a) How many multiplications does it take to evaluate the one-variable polynomial, Σ= + + + + = n i i i n n a a x a x a x a x 0 2 0 1 2 [...] . when the operations are performed as indicated? (Remember that powers are repeated multiplications and must be counted as such.) Write this number of multiplications as a function of n. b) Use mathematical induction to prove that your answer is correct. c) Find another way to evaluate this polynomial by doing the operations in a different order so that fewer multiplications are needed. Hint: Think of ways to intermix addition and multiplication and experiment with polynomials of lower degree. Write the number of multiplications as a new function of n. The best algorithm will use only n multiplications. Explain the algorithm you will use. d) How many multiplications does it take to evaluate the two-variable polynomial, ΣΣ = = n i n j i j ij a x y 0 0 when the operations are performed as indicated?

40|$|Globalisation {{is making}} its mark on our food through more and more {{products}} which {{seem to be more}} and more the same. At the same time, the market for 'local foods' is growing apace in many countries to the great delight of consumers yearning for authenticity at their table. Where do things stand in the ACP countries? Paul Bom Kondé, Didier Chabrol and José Muchnik chew the fat together. How are ACP countries being affected by this convergence of food tastes? José Muchnik Tastes and products are converging, but the way people eat and identify with food are not. Take the example of Coca Cola, a highly symbolic example, which has sort of become part of local food culture. People drink it with yam stew in Côte d'Ivoire, or with millet couscous in Senegal. Paul Bom Kondé That's as may be, but in ACP countries this convergence is manifested better by products like tomato paste, canned sardines or mackerel, corned beef or lager beer. They are held in high esteem by many people, especially those who developed a taste for them when abroad, and they are even more highly valued than they in fact deserve. But their mass production means that they are available at low prices, and they do keep and travel well. So they are very competitive with local products. Didier Chabrol There's no denying that there is a major trend of tastes converging, {{but at the same time}} there is another trend: people are looking for products which evoke local values. In fact no-one eats only one product, and there is a tendency towards diversifying what we eat. At noon a person may eat canned sardines or pasta with tomato paste, and in the evening s/he will want to eat a dish of gari or foutou from back home. J. M. You see, food is more than a question of proteins, carbohydrates and so on. It has to do with a feeling, it's in the imagination, it binds people. Food is a point of reference which everyone can recognise and share. We grow up in a given place, but also in the context of a language, and a food. In Europe people are reacting to convergence by standing up for 'local foods', what the French call 'terroir', or 'of the land'. How do you define this concept? J. M. It's a complex notion, embracing the soil, climate, rain, sunshine - and it also has a cultural and social dimension. D. C. There's an objective element to it. Actually, it's a collection of biological factors : in any given place, a certain plant will grow a certain way. But the cultural and social dimension encompasses skills and knowledge which have developed over time. J. M. Right, this land thing, it's not just about a place, but about peoples' knowledge and their memories of that place. D. C. Those countries where the concept is less well known the Anglo-Saxon world for example have developed their industry at the cost of their agriculture, and in so doing they have cut their ties with the land. Since 1830 these countries have, broadly speaking, imported most of their food. Latin countries, on the other hand, like France, Spain or Italy, have maintained and nurtured the conditions which are the basis of the emotional, cultural and social role of the concept. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> concept could be used or promoted in ACP countries? D. C. There isn't enough historical basis for the concept to replicate the way it works in some European countries. Put simply, local consumption patterns do not go back far enough. P. B. K. Travel is an important factor in enhancing the position of local products. They do get exported of course to other regions, but they also sell locally to consumers who come looking for them. In this sense, the concept of local products from the land can also mean a land of welcomes. This is what drove the growth of traditional products like aklui (a gruel mix made from maize) in Benin, or sorghum beer. Do you foresee growth in food trade, technology transfer and exchange of recipes between ACP countries and regions? P. B. K. The example of atiéké (cassava couscous) in Côte d'Ivoire is a good one; it is the best known of all atiékés. It is produced by a community in Abidjan, and its popularity comes from the demand driven by migrants returning to their countries of origin after spending some time in the big city. A product gets promoted first by migration, and then by marketing. D. C. But you have to make sure that products are clearly identifiable not only by the packaging but also by their labelling. If you want your chocolate to come from SaoTomé, you want to be sure that it does. What changes are in store for farmers and consumers, given these exchanges of food and enhancement of local products? P. B. K. Let's be clear about one thing: most people in ACP countries eat what they produce. But about 35 % of the population it varies widely from country to country now have urbanised eating habits, and are in a position to choose. D. C. Our tastes are globalising, no doubt about that. The fascination of local products is just marginal for the consumer. Marginal yes, but it should not be neglected: in France, people eat oysters from the Atlantic and wine from the Champagne region over a short period of a few days at the end of the year. A great many producers have latched on to this very specific demand and live the whole year from selling 80 % of their production in just a few days. The point is that a model of consumption does not need to be widespread for a producer to make a living from it. Therein lies an opportunity for ACP countries to grasp. Globalisation {{is making its}} mark on our food through more and more products which seem to be more and more the same. At the same time, the market for 'local foods' is growing apace in many countries to the great delight of consumers yearning for [...] ...|$|E
