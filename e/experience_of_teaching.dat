500|$|In January 2014, Lamont and Scottish Labour faced {{criticism}} {{after the}} party voted against an SNP motion that included the introduction of free school meals for pupils in their {{first three years of}} primary education, and a commitment to childcare for pre-school children. The motion also contained measures that would only be implemented in the event of Scottish independence, something Labour said it could not support. Recalling her <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> underprivileged children, Lamont told the parliament that free school meals would not be her priority, and tabled an unsuccessful amendment calling for greater childcare provisions instead. The motion was later passed by a majority of 67–46. In The Daily Telegraph, Cochrane wrote that the strategy had allowed the SNP to claim Labour opposed the principle of free school meals because they [...] "fell for a bit of skulduggery that Ms Lamont and her business managers should have seen coming a mile off".|$|E
500|$|From April to July 1907 Walpole was in Germany, {{tutoring}} {{the children}} of the popular author Elizabeth von Arnim. In 1908 he taught French at Epsom College. His brief <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> is reflected in his third novel, Mr Perrin and Mr Traill. As well as the clerical forebears, Walpole had notable authors in his family tree: on his father's side, the novelist and letter writer Horace Walpole, and on his mother's Richard Harris Barham, author of The Ingoldsby Legends. It was as an author that Walpole felt impelled to make his career. He moved to London and found work as a book reviewer for The Standard, writing fiction in his spare time. He had by this time recognised unreservedly that he was homosexual. His encounters were necessarily discreet, as such activities were illegal in Britain, and remained so throughout his lifetime. He was constantly searching for [...] "the perfect friend"; an early candidate was the stage designer Percy Anderson, to whom he was intimately attached for some time from 1910 onwards.|$|E
500|$|Barbauld's Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for Children were a {{revolution}} in children's literature. For the first time, {{the needs of the}} child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them and, even more important, she developed a style of [...] "informal dialogue between parent and child" [...] that would dominate children's literature for a generation. In Lessons for Children, a four-volume, age-adapted reading primer, Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son. More than likely, many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld's <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> her own son, Charles. This series is far more than a way to acquire literacy—it also introduces the reader to [...] "elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility." [...] Moreover, it exposes the child to the principles of [...] "botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry ... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [...] astronomy." [...] The series was relatively popular and Maria Edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co-authored with her father, Practical Education (1798), that it is [...] "one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared." ...|$|E

60|$|Various {{forms of}} natural {{character}} and temperament {{would no doubt}} be found to occur in constant proportions among any large group of persons of the same race, but what those proportions may be has never yet been investigated. It {{is extremely difficult to}} estimate it by observations of adults, owing to their habit of restraining natural ill tendencies, and to their long-practised concealment of those they do not restrain but desire to hide. The necessary observations ought, however, to be easily made on young children in schools, whose manifestations of character are conspicuous, who are simultaneously for months and years under the eye of the same master or mistress, and who are daily classed according to their various merits. I have occasionally asked the opinion of persons well qualified to form them, and who have had <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching,</b> as to the most obvious divisions of character to be found among school children. The replies have differed, but those on which most stress was laid were connected with energy, sociability, desire to attract notice, truthfulness, thoroughness, and refinement.|$|E

As guided by use of a phenomenographic analysis framework three conceptions of awareness were identified that detail the collective meaning associated with participants’ <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> using a GBA, namely that of a Learner, a Collaborator, and/or a Catalyst.

40|$|This study explores three Korean American {{social studies}} teachers' <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> social studies, {{focusing}} on their curricular and pedagogical perceptions and practices. Framed by sociocultural theory, {{this study aims}} {{to shed light on}} the heterogeneous stories and socially and culturally contextualized <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> Korean American social studies teachers, which have been largely undocumented in the social studies scholarship. The major research question for this study is: How do three Korean American social studies teachers perceive social studies curriculum and implement pedagogy in the realities of their classrooms? Subsidiary questions are: (a) What are these Korean American social studies teachers' perceptions and <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> profession in American public schools?; (b) How do these Korean American social studies teachers perceive social studies curriculum and implement pedagogy in the realities of classrooms?; and (c) How do sociocultural <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> these teachers influence their curricular and pedagogical practices? This qualitative multicase study investigates three Korean American teachers who taught global history in urban public high schools in the Northeast. Data sources include a semester-long classroom observation, interviews, and artifacts. Findings indicate these three Korean American teachers exhibited diverse, complex, and contextualized <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> profession, and particularly teaching social studies. The racial minority teachers' <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> racism and academic struggles during K- 12 schooling, cross-cultural/international experiences, and familial immigration backgrounds served as a springboard for them to have better understandings of their culturally and linguistically diverse students and to teach for global/multicultural perspectives. Powerful teacher education infused with social justice perspectives and supportive, autonomous, and cooperative school atmosphere aided them to implement student-centered, inquiry-based pedagogies which improved academic engagement of their students. Meanwhile, misguided curricular beliefs and philosophical stance, rigid school culture, bureaucratic school personnel, pressure from high-stakes tests, test-driven contexts, and racism pervasive in school culture became barriers for the teachers to practice culturally relevant and meaningful pedagogy in their classrooms...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. The article {{argues for}} a closer {{association}} between information seeking research and the practices <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> information seeking. Findings are presented from a research project on information seeking, didactics and learning (IDOL) investigating librarians' and teachers' <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> information seeking. Method. Thirteen teachers and five librarians, teaching 12 - 19 year-old students in three schools, participated. Forty-five interviews were conducted {{over a period of}} three years. Analysis. The IDOL project adopted a phenomenographic approach with the purpose of describing patterns <b>of</b> variation in <b>experiences.</b> The findings were also analysed by way of relating them to four competing approaches to the mediation of information literacy. Results. A gap was identified between <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> content that focused on sources and order, and <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> assessment criteria applied to students' work that focused on the importance of correct facts and the analysis of information. These findings indicate a highly restricted range <b>of</b> <b>teaching</b> contents when compared with the four theoretical approaches to the mediation of information literacy. Conclusion. Teaching information seeking might be enhanced by a wider repertoire of contents reflecting more varied theoretical understanding developed in information seeking research, particularly as regards the importance of content and context related to user perspectives...|$|R
