5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric Flair defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent Flair head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, {{wrapped it around}} his fist and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, Flair countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in Flair sending him towards the steel cage. After that, Flair bit Triple H's head, bloodying him <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead,</b> this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when Flair reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing Flair to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E

500|$|The {{main event}} was the [...] "I Quit" [...] {{match for the}} WWE Championship, in which John Cena defended his title against JBL. Cena {{came out on the}} flatbed of a semi truck with a DJ on a {{turntable}} mixing his theme song. During the match, both Cena and JBL were able to get in offense. One part of the match saw Cena backdrop JBL through the announce table. Shortly after, JBL hit Cena with a steel chair which caused Cena to bleed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> Back in the ring, JBL hit Cena with a Clothesline from Hell thrice. Cena later hit JBL with a Five Knuckle Shuffle and a FU. Later in the match, up the ramp area, Cena threw JBL face first through a television monitor. The match ended when JBL said [...] "I quit", as Cena prepared to hit him with an exhaust pipe, which came from the semi truck that was at the ramp area. As a result, Cena retained the WWE Championship. Despite the match being over, Cena then hit JBL with the exhaust pipe. Because of the amount of blood Cena lost, the pay-per-view was rated TV-MA on WWE Network On Demand.|$|E

500|$|Sahih Bukhari narrates Muhammad {{describing}} his revelations as [...] "sometimes it is (revealed) like {{the ringing of}} a bell". Aisha reported, [...] "I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> (as the Inspiration was over)". According to Welch these descriptions may be considered genuine, since {{they are unlikely to}} have been forged by later Muslims. Muhammad was confident that he could distinguish his own thoughts from these messages. According to the Quran, one of the main roles of Muhammad is to warn the unbelievers of their eschatological punishment (Quran , Quran [...] ). Occasionally the Quran did not explicitly refer to Judgment day but provided examples from the history of extinct communities and warns Muhammad's contemporaries of similar calamities (Quran [...] ). Muhammad did not only warn those who rejected God's revelation, but also dispensed good news for those who abandoned evil, listening to the divine words and serving God. Muhammad's mission also involves preaching monotheism: The Quran commands Muhammad to proclaim and praise the name of his Lord and instructs him not to worship idols or associate other deities with God.|$|E
500|$|After scoring an unbeaten 257 {{in a minor}} {{match against}} Norfolk, Headley scored 89 in his team's victory over Glamorgan and 182 against Warwickshire. However, he failed {{in the third and}} final Test, scoring nine and 12 as West Indies were {{defeated}} by an innings. The tourists thus lost the series 2–0; in the three Tests Headley's aggregate was 277 runs at an average of 55.40, the best figures for the team. After the Test matches were over, Headley had an operation to remove a sebaceous cyst <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and missed several games, before returning for an end-of-season festival match in which he scored 167 against an England XI. When the tour concluded, Headley had scored 2,320 runs with seven hundreds, at an average of 66.28. This was over 1,000 runs more than any other tourist and placed him third in the English first-class batting averages for the season. Ivan Barrow believed Headley reached his batting peak during the tour. He recalled how many bowlers tried to hit his pads with the ball but Headley simply flicked the ball away. Headley's performances earned him selection as one of Wisden's Cricketers of the Year. The accompanying article called his tour [...] "almost a triumphant march" [...] and described him as [...] "the best batsman the West Indies have ever produced." [...] Wisden editor Sydney Southerton also described him as a giant in the team and wrote: [...] "From what we had been told by English players who had been to the West Indies, we were fully prepared for Headley's success, but even so, he astonished most of us." [...] Headley bowled more than he had previously: prior to the tour, he had taken three first class wickets, but took 21 wickets in England at an average of 34.33, bowling off spin.|$|E
2500|$|One famous {{mistranslation}} of a Biblical text is the {{rendering of}} the Hebrew word [...] (keren), which has several meanings, as [...] "horn" [...] in a context where it more plausibly means [...] "beam of light": [...] as a result, for centuries artists, including sculptor Michelangelo, have rendered Moses the Lawgiver with horns growing <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Lever, and his bowling partner Bob Willis, both found {{themselves}} suffering from sweat falling into their eyes. It was suggested, naively, {{by the team}} physiotherapist that they apply strips of gauze covered with Vaseline above their eyes to divert sweat from their forehead away. In play these were found to slip, and Willis removed his. Eventually Lever also removed his and lay the gauze on the ground near the stumps where it was noticed by the umpires and Indian team, but not before he had used sweat <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> to shine the ball.|$|E
2500|$|Although Athena appears before Zeus at Knossos—in Linear B, as , a-ta-na po-ti-ni-ja, [...] "Mistress Athena"—in the Classical Olympian pantheon, Athena was remade as the {{favourite}} {{daughter of}} Zeus, born fully armed <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead.</b> The {{story of her}} birth comes in several versions. In the version recounted by Hesiod in his Theogony, Zeus lay with Metis, the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom, but he immediately feared the consequences because Gaia and Ouranos had prophesized that Metis would bear children wiser than he himself. In order to prevent this, Zeus swallowed Metis, {{but it was too}} late because Metis had already conceived.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Static Age {{sessions}} the Misfits began a {{shift in}} songwriting and appearance, with Danzig writing more songs inspired by B horror and science fiction films.

2500|$|Like Ares {{who was the}} son of Zeus and Hera, Mars {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be the son of Jupiter and Juno. However, in a version of his birth given by Ovid, he {{was the son of}} Juno alone. Jupiter had usurped the mother's function when he gave birth to Minerva directly <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> (or mind); to restore the balance, Juno sought the advice of the goddess Flora on how to do the same. Flora obtained a magic flower (Latin flos, plural flores, a masculine word) and tested it on a [...] who became fecund at once. She then plucked a flower ritually using her thumb, touched Juno's belly, and impregnated her. Juno withdrew to Thrace and the shore of Marmara for the birth.|$|E
2500|$|Sahih al-Bukhari narrates Muhammad {{describing}} the revelations as, [...] "Sometimes it is (revealed) like {{the ringing of}} a bell" [...] and Aisha reported, [...] "I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> (as the Inspiration was over)." [...] Muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was accompanied with a vision. The agent of revelation is mentioned as the [...] "one mighty in power", the one who [...] "grew clear to view {{when he was on}} the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer." [...] The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the Encyclopaedia of Islam that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood.|$|E
2500|$|On the September 22 {{episode of}} Raw, Shane McMahon was hospitalized {{after the events}} in his match against Kane at Unforgiven. Shane sent a [...] "message" [...] to Kane, {{but before he could}} finish, Kane {{appeared}} in Shane's hospital room and attacked him. The attack led to Shane bleeding <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and Kane telling him to [...] "Get Well Soon!". Two weeks later, Shane interfered in a match between Kane and Rosey, which angered Kane. After the match, Kane ran around rampant backstage looking for Shane. Kane walked by a Semi-Truck and saw Shane, who taunted Kane and jumped into a limousine. Kane broke the limousine's window and got in through the sunroof. Shane proceeded to get out from the drivers seat and rigged the limousine to crash directly into another truck. After the crash, workers attend to the limousine with a bloody Kane inside. The following week on Raw, Shane challenged Kane, who was in the hospital recovering from the car crash from the week before, to a match at Survivor Series. As the challenge was made, Kane sprang up and attacked a doctor and a nurse who were attending to him. On the October 27 episode of Raw, Shane challenged Kane to an Ambulance match, which Kane accepted. At Survivor Series, Kane defeated Shane after Kane performed a Tombstone Piledriver on him and then throwing Shane into the ambulance.|$|E

2500|$|Since Mortal Kombat 3, Sub-Zero {{has had a}} scar {{running down}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>forehead</b> and across his right eye as a mark of death. The scar was {{originally}} red, and later changed to blue in Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance {{as a result of}} Sub-Zero's enhanced powers. In Mortal Kombat: Deception, his scar has faded {{to the point where it}} can no longer be seen. [...] He now wore an armored uniform heavily inspired by Dynastic era Chinese battle armor, though it was often criticized by fans as being too reminiscent of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles villain, the Shredder. [...] However, Sub-Zero's alternate uniform was very reminiscent of Chinese culture, even featuring Sub-Zero without a cowl and a Qing Dynasty-era hairstyle. In Mortal Kombat: Armageddon, Sub-Zero reverts to his masked costume from Deadly Alliance, retaining the scar, which is not part of his alternate costume (which is the primary one from Deception). Since Deadly Alliance, Sub-Zero is the only character who has shown considerable signs of aging. Concept art from Deadly Alliance depicted him with a graying, receding hairline, and a more pale and gaunt face, while his scar was now blue and his forearms frozen over. Although Sub-Zero originally had blue eyes, they turned white after he obtained the Dragon Medallion in the game. Sub-Zero's appearance in Shaolin Monks was one of the most revised ones from the title. Character lead Mark Lappin did almost ten passes on his design; producer Shaun Himmerick noted that [...] "we went through literally 5-6 heads and styles of head costume on him" [...] and commented that Sub-Zero's design in Mortal Kombat was difficult to make although most people called it [...] "simple". In the end, the staff was satisfied with his final look in the game as it reminisces them to his classic outfit.|$|E
