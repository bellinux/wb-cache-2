STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a cross-sectional evaluation assessing the diagnostic test characteristics of International Classification of Diseases- 9 External-Cause-of-Injury codes (<b>E-codes)</b> compared with a reference standard of medical record review. This study was nested within a prospective cohort of elders using warfarin, digoxin, or phenytoin as identified in the Pharmaceutical Assistance Contract for the Elderly benefit program. RESULTS: We identified 4, 803 subjects contributing 11, 409 person-years of exposure {{to at least one}} of three drug groups. Subjects experienced 8, 756 hospitalizations, of which 304 were deemed, by expert review, to be a result of an adverse event of warfarin, digoxin, or phenytoin. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPVs) and negative predictive values for drug-specific <b>E-codes</b> were warfarin [...] 25. 5 %, 98. 3 %, 46. 6 %, and 95. 7 %; digoxin [...] 84. 0 %, 99. 1 %, 56. 8 %, and 99. 8 %; and phenytoin [...] 86. 7 %, 98. 7 %, 59. 1 %, and 99. 7 %.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the accuracy of}} a computerized method for classifying injury narratives into external-cause-of-injury and poisoning (<b>E-code)</b> categories. Methods: This study used injury narratives and corresponding E-codes assigned by experts from the 1997 and 1998 US National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). A Fuzzy Bayesian model was used to assign injury descriptions to 13 <b>E-code</b> categories. Sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were measured by comparing the computer generated codes with <b>E-code</b> categories assigned by experts. Results: The computer program correctly classified 4695 (82. 7 %) of the 5677 injury narratives when multiple words were included as keywords in the model. The use of multiple-word predictors compared with using single words alone improved both the sensitivity and specificity of the computer generated codes. The program is capable of identifying and filtering out cases that would benefit most from manual coding. For example, the program {{could be used to}} code the narrative if the maximum probability of a category given the keywords in the narrative was at least 0. 9. If the maximum probability was lower than 0. 9 (which will be the case for approximately 33 % of the narratives) the case would be filtered out for manual review.

Infectious chimeric MuLVs, recovered from murine cells microinjected with these DNAs, were inoculated into newborn mice to test the leukemogenic potential of these viruses. We found that the U 3 long terminal repeat region from Gross A genomes was sufficient to confer an intermediate leukemogenic potential to chimeric MuLVs. Sequencing data indicated that the U 3 tandem direct repeat was responsible for this effect. Adding most of the Gross A p 15 <b>E-coding</b> sequences to the Gross A U 3 long terminal repeat enhanced the leukemogenic potential of chimeric viruses significantly. Adding a larger 3 '-end env region (all p 15 <b>E-coding</b> sequences and 345 base pairs of the carboxy terminus of gp 70) to the Gross A U 3 long terminal repeat restored the full leukemogenic potential of Gross A MuLV. Chimeric viruses harboring only the Gross A 3 '-end env region were, however, nonleukemogenic. Similar chimeric MuLVs, constructed with genomes from the parental weakly leukemogenic BALB/c B-tropic MuLVs and nonleukemogenic BALB/c N-tropic MuLVs, were also studied.

40|$|The field “external {{cause of}} injury code (<b>E-code)</b> ” in injury {{datasets}} indicates the specific reason {{of an injury}} such as fall, cut, burn and electric shock. E-coded injury data is important for identifying the factors causing most serious injuries and prioritizing prevention efforts. E-codes are typically assigned to injury records by trained human coders based on the injury narrative – {{a process that is}} expensive in terms of time and resources. Machine Learning (ML) models offer a promising alternative for quickly assigning E-codes (autocoding) based on the injury narrative but are not able to predict all categories with high accuracy. The primary reasons for low prediction accuracy include: large number of categories, poor quality of training data, heavily skewed distribution of data, and the sparse and noisy nature of injury narratives. Apart from data-related challenges, one of the fundamental reasons behind low autocoding accuracy of classical ML models is that these models use the bag-of-words approach that considers the statistical distribution of words in different categories but does not have knowledge of the syntax, semantics, and pragmatics of the narrative text. ^ Natural Language Processing (NLP) approaches can be used to extract deeper linguistic concepts from the narrative and supplement the ML models to improve autocoding performance. This study examined the use of “non-targeted” NLP approaches and proposed using “targeted” NLP approaches based on the causal model of E-codes for improving autocoding accuracy. Different methods of supplementing the ML model with causal concepts were examined: rule-based, narrative text transformation, and adding nodes in Bayes Network. ^ The non-targeted NLP approaches [...] “Syntactic Tagging” and “Syntactic Tagging with Hypernym Mapping” used with Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB) model resulted in lower prediction performance as compared to using plain narrative text. The targeted NLP approaches resulted in improved classification performance of the target category. For <b>E-code</b> “Electric Current”, co-occurrence rules based on causal elements were able to identify cases with extremely high (98 %) Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and improved the prediction performance of MNB, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression models. The causal concept “Person Fell” was identified using syntactic parsing and word-sequence rules with extremely high PPV (92 %), and embedding it to the narrative resulted in improved classification performance of FALL-related categories. Adding causal concepts as nodes in the Bayesian Network resulted in minor improvements in prediction performance. ...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{effectiveness}} of automobile safety belts in reducing risk of serious injury in traffic crashes is well documented, safety belt use in many U. S. jurisdictions remains low. Michigan's mandatory safety belt law for front-seat occupants, implemented in July 1985, is one of 34 similar laws in the United States intended to increase belt use and reduce crash-related injuries. Using time-series intervention analyses of data from 14 hospitals throughout the state, we found a 19 % reduction {{in the rate of}} admitted patients for all automobile occupant injuries and a 20 % reduction in the rate of admitted patients with extremity injuries following implementation of the safety belt law. The utility of hospital data for the evaluation of interventions like the safety belt law reinforce the importance of consistently recording <b>E-codes</b> for all injury patients...|$|R
40|$|Methods: Rates {{and causes}} of {{traumatic}} injury-related fetal deaths in Pennsylvania were determined from a manual review of all fetal death certificates filed from 1995 to 1997 (7131 cases). Results: Thirty one traumatic injury cases were identified (6. 5 / 100000 live births). Most cases (94 %) {{could be identified}} from the diagnosis code of 760. 5 (maternal injury) and 87 % contained narratives indicating specific injury mechanisms. Motor vehicles were {{the leading cause of}} injury (81 %). Placental separation was the leading diagnosis (42 %). Conclusions: The ICD- 9 -CM code 760. 5 appears to be a specific indicator of traumatic fetal death, though it is not known how sensitive an indicator it is. Though not usually <b>E-coded,</b> the death certificates contained enough information to allow ascertainment of injury mechanism. These are very conservative estimates of the burden of the problem. The major role that motor vehicle injuries have on reported traumatic fetal injury deaths was shown and a significan...|$|R
40|$|External {{cause of}} injury codes (<b>E-codes)</b> and the Occupational Injury and Illness Classification system codes (OIICS) {{are useful for}} the purpose of {{accident}} prevention analysis. However, the coding task has become burdensome as the trained coders need to code a huge amount of text narratives. This study presents the use of Naïve Bayes machine learning tool to classify large amounts of narrative texts, including the strategic assignment of the tasks between human and computer in order to reduce erroneous decisions. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify the optimal region for different categories to achieve optimal results by effectively minimizing resources necessary for manual coding. The results showed that by utilizing the ROC based reject rule to assign difficult tasks for manual coding, it was possible to obtain an final accuracy of the classification of 82 percent, 89 percent and 94 percent respectively for filtering strategies in which 20 percent, 35 percent and 49 percent of the narratives were manually coded. ...|$|R
