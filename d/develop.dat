After studying various software development methods, four basic <b>developing</b> strategies are found. The four basic <b>developing</b> strategies are linear <b>developing</b> strategy, iterative <b>developing</b> strategy, <b>developing</b> strategy of decomposition, <b>developing</b> strategy of assembling. For any a software development method, it may use a type basic <b>developing</b> strategy, it may use also two types or more than two types of basic <b>developing</b> strategies. The content of the basic <b>developing</b> strategies is discussed. People can use the basic <b>developing</b> strategies to build new software development methods, and to build development program of definite issues...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{positive}} outcomes of FDI inflows from <b>developed</b> or <b>developing</b> countries {{are well known}} from the literature. However, the recent declining trend from <b>developed</b> countries {{and the emergence of}} FDI from <b>developing</b> countries at a huge amount have triggered our interest on the issue whether (or not) FDI from <b>developed</b> countries are more risk averse than FDI from <b>developing</b> countries. This could imply that FDI from <b>developing</b> countries could be contributing more towards economic development in host <b>developing</b> countries. Focusing on Malaysian manufacturing sector, this study attempts to identify the risk averseness of FDI from <b>developed</b> countries against FDI from <b>developing</b> countries...|$|R

5|$|Development of an endometrial {{hyperplasia}} (overgrowth of endometrial cells) is {{a significant}} risk factor because hyperplasias can and often do <b>develop</b> into adenocarcinoma, though cancer can <b>develop</b> without {{the presence of a}} hyperplasia. Within ten years, 8–30% of atypical endometrial hyperplasias <b>develop</b> into cancer, whereas 1–3% of non-atypical hyperplasias do so. An atypical hyperplasia is one with visible abnormalities in the nuclei. Pre-cancerous endometrial hyperplasias are also referred to as endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia. Mutations in the KRAS gene can cause endometrial hyperplasia and therefore Type I endometrial cancer. Endometrial hyperplasia typically occurs after the age of 40. Endometrial glandular dysplasia occurs with an overexpression of p53, and develops into a serous carcinoma.|$|E

While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients <b>develop</b> chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease.

40|$|Host country {{government}} officials in <b>developing</b> and <b>developed</b> countries alike {{would like to know}} the impact of their public policies on foreign investment in their countries. Unfortunately, the literature does not provide a single view, and there are likely to be differences between <b>developing</b> and <b>developed</b> countries. This paper examines the impact of three host country government policies on the host’s FDI stock: taxation, good governance, and infrastructure. We focus on whether the impact of these factors on FDI differs depending on the level of development of the host country. The regression results indicate that FDI is sensitive to host country taxation in <b>developed</b> countries, but not in <b>developing</b> countries; FDI is sensitive to host country corruption in <b>developing</b> countries but not developed; and FDI shows sensitivity to host country infrastructure quality in both <b>developed</b> and <b>developing</b> host countries, though FDI appears to be more sensitive in <b>developing</b> host countries.
