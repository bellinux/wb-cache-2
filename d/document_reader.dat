The harsh truth however is that e-documents differ greatly from their physical paper counterparts, with many users opting to print them before reading.

Incorporating tools into digital <b>document</b> <b>readers</b> to aid users in day-to-day tasks will enhance their performance and hopefully increase user uptake of digital reading.

Examples include: razor (bait) and blades (hook); cell phones (bait) and air time (hook); computer printers (bait) and ink cartridge refills (hook); and cameras (bait) and prints (hook).

In the SSR filter, Between-the-Eyes is selected as a face representative because of its characteristic is common to most people and is easily seen {{for a wide range of}} face orientation.

40|$|For {{open-ended}} information tasks, users must {{sift through}} many potentially relevant documents, a practice {{we refer to}} as document triage.

To support document triage, we have developed an extensible multi-application architecture that initially includes an information workspace and a <b>document</b> <b>reader.</b> An Interest Profile Manager infers users ' interests from their interactions with the triage applications, coupled with {{the characteristics of the}} documents they are interacting with. The resulting interest profile is used to generate visualizations that direct users ' attention to documents or parts of documents that match their inferred interests. The novelty of our approach lies in the aggregation of activity records across applications to generate fine-grained models of user interest...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} is conducted into portable Braille devices {{which would allow}} visually impaired individuals to read electronic documents. Consumer research conducted on the existing Braille devices has identified {{the need for a}} portable and flexible E-books reader. This poster describes the design and development of an electronic device that will enable reading of any electronic text document through a single Braille cell. Braille books tend to be bulky in size due to the minimum size requirements for each Braille cell. Ebooks can be read in Braille using refreshable Braille displays connected to a computer. However, the refreshable Braille displays are expensive, bulky and are not portable. These factors restrict blind and visually impaired individuals from accessing much of the literature which isn’t available in Braille. Our design of a novel Electronic Braille <b>Document</b> <b>Reader</b> will overcome the problem of carrying bulky Braille books by allowing multiple e-books to be saved in a portable memory device. By convert text from ASCII into Braille patterns, it will give an access to books which were never published in Braille. The single Braille cell design reduces the bulk of the device allowing it to be portable. An additional benefit of the device is that it can be integrated into a glove and worn thus giving the user freedom to carry on with other tasks while reading. Our investigation has confirmed the feasibility of the Electronic Braille <b>document</b> <b>reader</b> built around a microcontroller system. Portable Electronic Braille <b>Document</b> <b>Reader</b> will provide substantial benefits to blind and visually impaired individuals, and overcome the limitations of Braille books...|$|E
