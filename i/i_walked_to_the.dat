60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{hearthrug}} {{and stood}} quite still there regarding this new situation.|$|E
60|$|So I sang as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kitchen door, {{and sent}} Jonas {{to the barn}} for the bottle.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door, {{waited a}} moment before I opened it, and turned round {{to look at her}} again.|$|E
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pool.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come here, Leo," [...] he said, {{after his}} orders had been obeyed. [...] "Hold this coil, and pay {{it out as}} <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> berg with the end in my hand." ...|$|R
60|$|Miller and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club together, pondering deeply on the {{implications}} of the night's performance.|$|R
60|$|The man {{dropped to}} one side, {{apparently}} astonished. As <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> clerk's desk I heard him {{call to a}} bell boy and say something about telegraph blanks.|$|E
6000|$|... "Agnes," [...] exclaimed, as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{house with}} my hands clasped and my eyes raised to the sky, [...] "the glacial period has given thee to me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "March 19, 1798. William and Basil and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hill tops. A [...] {{very cold}} bleak day. William wrote some lines {{describing}} a stunted [...] Thorn" [...] (Dorothy Wordsworth's Alfoxden Journal).--Ed.|$|E
60|$|For reply <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> slatted {{window and}} began to whistle. My action only {{increased}} the merchant's anger.|$|R
60|$|That night <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{cemetery}} with him. At {{the door}} of his vault he turned and pressed my hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fifth evening, after I had corralled my costly but uncongenial muttons, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ranch-house {{and stepped}} in the door.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{window to}} compose myself. The rain had given over; and, who should I {{see in the}} court-yard, but Mr. Begbie, the gardener, waiting outside to {{continue}} the dog-rose controversy with Sergeant Cuff.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's Cradell?" [...] said Eames, {{repeating the}} question. [...] "Upon my word, I don't know. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> office with him, but I haven't seen him since. We don't {{sit in the}} same room, you know." ...|$|E
60|$|If I {{would care}} {{to pay him}} a little visit! That officer had to hurry {{to keep up with}} the as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wharf. He led me aboard the River Queen, and stopped at the door of the after-cabin.|$|E
60|$|I did {{the only}} thing {{possible}} in that mental tumult; <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> straight <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kerbstone and held up my umbrella for a cab.|$|R
60|$|I {{understood}} that he was afraid. Answering him by an inclination of the head (I hate a coward!) <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> silently <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> box, and at {{the window}} learned that the next train would not start for two hours and a half.|$|R
6000|$|The young Duke of B. {{came in to}} bid us good-bye, as he {{is going}} off to England. God bless him! He is a hawk of a good nest. Afterwards <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Welsh pool, Skene declining to go, for I ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mighty fine certainly,' said Ralph, {{with great}} testiness. 'When I {{first went to}} business, ma'am, I took a penny loaf and a ha'porth of milk for my breakfast as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city every morning; {{what do you say}} to that, ma'am? Breakfast! Bah!' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{railway station}} accompanied, it is needless to say, by Gabriel Betteredge. I had {{the letter in}} my pocket, and the nightgown safely packed in a little bag--both to be submitted, before I slept that night, to the {{investigation}} of Mr. Bruff.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ellen, {{how long}} will it be before <b>I</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of those hills? I wonder what lies on the other side--is it the sea?' ...|$|R
6000|$|My {{heart beat}} rapidly as <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate. How would the good lady {{who had done}} so much for Kate and myself receive me? ...|$|R
6000|$|There {{was another}} long silence. [...] "So {{that is how}} we stand," [...] I said {{with an air of}} having things defined. <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> slowly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window. Across {{the park}} {{the outline of}} the trees and even the bracken stood out with {{extraordinary}} distinctness in the brilliant moonlight. There was not a breath of air, although every window in the house was open. We were having a few days of record heat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Go {{out of the}} room; {{return to}} the nursery," [...] was her mandate. My look or {{something}} else must have struck her as offensive, for she spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation. I got up, I went to the door; I came back again; <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> window, across the room, then close up to her.|$|E
60|$|Balanites was not uncommon, {{forming a}} low thorny bush, with Aegle marmelos and Feronia elephantum. Having rested the tired elephant, we pushed {{on in the}} evening to the next stage, Baghoda, {{arriving}} there at 3 a.m., {{and after a few}} hours' rest, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bungalow of Lieutenant Beadle, the surveyor of roads, sixteen miles further.|$|E
60|$|Feeling {{that this}} woman had the better of it, with her calm, polished, highbred sarcasms, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 'pike, full of hopes of a sweet revenge.|$|R
60|$|I {{became aware}} of some one moving about in the passage, and went {{and shut the door}} of the room, then <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{hearthrug}} and turned.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> rapidly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gate. When {{challenged}} by the sentinel, I turned to summon my instructor. He was nowhere visible: desolate and forbidding, as about the broken statue of Ozymandias, ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{break of}} the poop. On the overshadowed deck all hands {{stood by the}} forebraces waiting for my order. The stars ahead seemed to be gliding from right to left. And all was so still {{in the world that}} I heard the quiet remark [...] "She's round," [...] passed in a tone of intense relief between two seamen.|$|E
60|$|I {{tried to}} read, I tried to write, I paced about the lawn, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} lane, I put new flies upon my fishing-hooks, I began to index my father's library--in a dozen ways I endeavoured to relieve the {{suspense}} which was becoming intolerable. My sister, I could see, was suffering from the same feverish restlessness.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>walked</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{other end}} of the room, and stood facing the {{carefully}} drawn curtains of the windows; fantastically, they seemed to represent the impasse to which my mind had come. Did she intend, ultimately, to get a divorce? I dared not ask her. The word rang horribly in my ears, though unpronounced; and I knew then that I lacked her courage, and the knowledge was part of my agony.|$|E
60|$|I {{threw the}} {{pole and line}} away, and then Rectus and <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hotel. We forgot all about Celia, who was left to go home when she chose.|$|R
60|$|The {{fellow was}} overdoing it a little, I thought; then, when I {{had seen him}} safely locked up for <b>the</b> night, <b>I</b> <b>walked</b> back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> kitchen slowly and very thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you take}} a turn down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mill, then, Annot? Heaven knows when you and <b>I</b> may <b>walk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> old mill again; it may be long enough before I see Echanbroignes again." ...|$|R
