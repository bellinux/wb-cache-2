5|$|Max van Gelder (12 February 1916– 2 October 2004), professionally {{known as}} Max Geldray, was a jazz <b>harmonica</b> player. Best known for {{providing}} the musical interludes for The Goon Show, {{he was also}} credited as being the first <b>harmonica</b> player to embrace the jazz style.|$|E
5|$|Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, George Strait, and Willie Nelson are Black's biggest musical influences. His {{style is}} {{traditional}} country. His voice {{is described as}} a smooth baritone and was initially compared to Merle Haggard. Black was self-taught on <b>harmonica,</b> guitar and bass at an early age. On his studio albums he plays acoustic and electric guitars as well as <b>harmonica.</b> In concert he plays primarily guitar, but does play drums and <b>harmonica.</b> Today, Clint Black is still an inspiration to new, up and coming country artists, as expressed by performers such as Jon Pardi and Aaron Watson.|$|E

50|$|In April 2013, {{along with}} his {{business}} partner Zombor Kovacs, Power started X-reed <b>Harmonicas,</b> a project devoted to making custom <b>harmonicas.</b>|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, this tuning is {{used with}} {{chromatic}} <b>harmonicas,</b> {{as opposed to}} the more common and popular diatonic <b>harmonicas,</b> which use Richter tuning.|$|R
50|$|Certain {{modifications}} to factory-built <b>harmonicas</b> {{can increase the}} sensitivity of the instrument and make overblows far easier to achieve. Lowering the reed gap (over the reedplate) and slightly narrowing reed slots (a process called embossing) are probably the most common customization methods used to set up overblow-friendly <b>harmonicas.</b> Because it involves both reeds in the chamber, overblowing is not possible on fully valved <b>harmonicas</b> such as the button chromatic.|$|R
5|$|The {{song was}} one of 10 pop singles named in a January 1966 issue of Billboard which {{credited}} the use of <b>harmonica</b> in folk, pop, and rhythm and blues (R) music for sparking a <b>harmonica</b> sales boom at record retailers in 1964 and 1965.|$|E

5|$|Paul Vaughn Butterfield (December 17, 1942May 4, 1987) was an American blues <b>harmonica</b> {{player and}} singer. After early {{training}} as a classical flautist, he developed an interest in blues <b>harmonica.</b> He explored the blues scene in his native Chicago, where he met Muddy Waters and other blues greats, who provided encouragement and opportunities for him to join in jam sessions. He soon began performing with fellow blues enthusiasts Nick Gravenites and Elvin Bishop.|$|E
50|$|Hohner Musikinstrumente GmbH & Co. KG is a German company specialising in the {{manufacture}} of musical instruments. Founded in 1857 by Matthias Hohner (1833-1902), Hohner is identified especially with <b>harmonicas</b> and accordions. The Hohner company has invented and produced many different styles, and most of the <b>harmonicas</b> used by professionals. The company also makes kazoos, recorder flutes, melodicas, banjos, guitars, bass guitars, accordions ,and ukuleles (under the brand name Lanikai), along with its one million <b>harmonicas</b> a year.|$|R
50|$|An {{even more}} serious problem with wood combs, {{especially}} in chromatic <b>harmonicas</b> (with their thin dividers between chambers), is that, as the combs expand and shrink over time, cracks can form in the combs, because the comb is held immobile by nails, resulting in disabling leakage. Much effort is devoted by serious players to restoring wood combs and sealing leaks. Some players used to soak wooden-combed <b>harmonicas</b> (diatonics, without windsavers) in water to cause a slight expansion, which they intended to make the seal between the comb, reed plates and covers more airtight. Modern wooden-combed <b>harmonicas</b> are less prone to swelling and contracting. Players still dip <b>harmonicas</b> in water for the way it affects tone and ease of bending notes.|$|R
50|$|Aside from bending, Richter-tuned <b>harmonicas</b> are modal.|$|R
5|$|Cowan {{was later}} {{a member of}} Kevin Borich Express, Ian Moss Band and Renée Geyer Band before {{pursuing}} a solo music career. Georgie Fame's album No Worries (1988) included Ayers Rock alumni Loughnan, Doyle, and Dunlop. McGuire died in July 1989 of a brain tumour. During the late 1980s, Hogg formed The Rhythm Snakes with Clayton Black on drums, Howie Smallman on <b>harmonica,</b> and Bob Thorne on guitar. In 1989, Hogg assembled a studio band to record a solo album with Thorne, Mark Alderman on <b>harmonica,</b> Ian Ironside on drums, Bob Patient on piano, and Bernie Payne on saxophone. Steve Hogg died on 20 July 1990 and his album, Various Fools & Vices, was released in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Each {{member of}} the band specializes {{in one or more}} musical instruments. Dama (Rasolofondraosolo Zafimahaleo) plays {{acoustic}} guitar, <b>harmonica</b> and the indigenous kabosy; Bekoto (Honoré August Rabekoto) plays guitar, piano, <b>harmonica</b> and the traditional sodina flute; and Raoul (Razafindranoa Raosolosolofo) played guitar and violin. Members Fafa (Famantanantsoa Andriamihaingo Rajaonarison) and Dadah (Andrianabelina Rakotobe) also play guitar and sing; Nono (Andrianabela Rakotobe) played bass and acoustic guitar. Charle (Charle-Bert Andrianaivo), the only {{member of the}} group who does not play guitar, provides vocals and percussion. While all members of the band provide vocal harmonies and solos, Fafa is the member most often featured as a solo singer.|$|E
5|$|Home {{could easily}} have {{produced}} {{the sound of the}} accordion (concertina) by the use of a small <b>harmonica</b> concealed in his mouth. The up and down movement of the accordion {{could easily have}} been produced by catching the bottom of the accordion in a loop of black thread, or on a hook.|$|E

50|$|The Koch Chromatic and Slide Harp {{are both}} {{designed}} {{in the same fashion}} as chromatic <b>harmonicas,</b> but possess the Richter tuning found in typical 10-hole diatonic <b>harmonicas.</b> Like the Educator 10, both are also 10-hole and built on a pearwood comb. The Slide Harp has been discontinued.|$|R

5|$|Lennon {{played a}} mouth organ during a bus journey {{to visit his}} cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon of a <b>harmonica</b> he could have if he came to Edinburgh the {{following}} day, where one had been stored in the bus depot since a passenger left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play <b>harmonica,</b> often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, {{and it became a}} signature sound in the group's early recordings. His mother taught him how to play the banjo, later buying him an acoustic guitar. At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.|$|E
5|$|The five-minute, 40-second gospel {{song was}} written in the key of G major with a tempo of 103 beats per minute.

The cast's performances were mostly recorded using motion capture technology, with additional dialogue and sound effects recorded in a studio. Red Dead Redemption also features an original score, which was composed by Bill Elm and Woody Jackson, collaborating with each other over fifteen months. Rockstar also consulted musicians who played traditional Western instruments, such as <b>harmonica</b> player Tommy Morgan.|$|E

The Merrymen became the island's most prominent contribution to calypso by the 1970s and into the 80s. Their style, known as blue beat, incorporated Barbadian folk songs and ballads, as well as American blues, country music, and a distinctive sound created by <b>harmonica,</b> guitar and banjo.|$|E

5|$|Kou Yaginuma's initial {{inspiration}} for the story came from a statement he once read describing the Hohner Little Lady <b>harmonica</b> {{as one of the}} first musical instruments taken into space. However, as an aspiring manga artist, Yaginuma had neither resources to conduct research on nor knowledge pertaining to spaceflight. He also hesitated to write the series because his own life experiences did not reflect the dreams of his characters. Despite these challenges, Yaginuma found comfort in the determination of his characters, especially that of Asumi Kamogawa.|$|E
5|$|Music {{critics have}} {{acknowledged}} his {{development of an}} original approach that places him among the best-known blues harp players. In 2006, he {{was inducted into the}} Blues Hall of Fame. Butterfield and the early members of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Both panels noted his <b>harmonica</b> skills and his contributions to bringing blues music to a younger and broader audience.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{featured}} {{arrangements of}} acoustic guitar, accompanied by piano, played by his sister, Bobbie, as well complementary arrangements of drums, <b>harmonica</b> and mandolin. The sparsely instrumented acoustic arrangements caused Columbia directors {{to doubt the}} wisdom of releasing the album as presented, feeling it was under-produced {{and no more than}} a demo. However, Nelson had complete creative control, and it was released without any further modifications.|$|E
