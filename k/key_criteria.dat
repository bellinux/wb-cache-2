5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can {{be presented to the}} International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities asked to complete a questionnaire regarding several <b>key</b> <b>criteria</b> related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E

25|$|In April 1994, the C-17 program {{remained}} over budget, and did {{not meet}} weight, fuel burn, payload and range specifications. It failed several <b>key</b> <b>criteria</b> during airworthiness evaluation tests. Technical problems were found with the mission software, landing gear, and other areas. In May 1994, it was proposed to cut production to as few as 32 aircraft; these cuts were later rescinded. A July 1994 GAO document revealed that Air Force and DoD studies from 1986 and 1991 stated the C-17 could use 6,400 more runways outside the U.S. than the C-5; {{it was discovered that}} these studies only considered runway dimensions, but not runway strength or Load Classification Numbers (LCN). The C-5 has a lower LCN, but the USAF classifies both in the same broad Load Classification Group (LCG). When considering runway dimensions and load ratings, the C-17's worldwide runway advantage over the C-5 shrank from 6,400 to 911 airfields. The C-17's ability to use low quality, austere airfields was not considered.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the multi-perspective criteria affecting {{the adoption of}} energy storage technologies, specifically lead-acid and lithium-ion battery technologies, in Demand Response systems. These criteria are incorporated into a multi-perspective analysis using a Hierarchical Decision Model (HDM) to identify the <b>key</b> <b>criterion</b> influencing the adoption lead-acid vs. lithium-ion technology for the Demand-Response usage scenario. With cost-efficiency being identified by the HDM as the <b>key</b> <b>criterion,</b> the cost efficiency of lithium-ion battery technology is modeled, showing that lithium-ion technology may potentially achieve price-parity with lead-acid technology by 2025. Predicated on this improved price efficiency over the next 10 years, a Bass Diffusion Model is generated, which predicts significant adoption of lithium-ion battery technology for both Demand Response (DR) and Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) usage scenarios. The model forecasts cumulative sales of $ 100 million USD over the next 10 years, and achieving peak single-year sales of $ 75 million USD in 2031. We conclude with {{the implications of this}} shift in technologies, and recommendations for further research...|$|R

Evaluation criteria in public procurement are {{an essential part of the}} selection process and play thus a highly important role when selecting the winning bid, or rather the the winner awarded with the public contract to be implemented. The paper focuses on below-threshold procurement in building area. Below-threshold public contracts can be divided into two groups according to the pre-set evaluation criteria. Either is there a single criterion for evaluation of the bids accepted, i. e. the <b>key</b> <b>criterion</b> is the lowest bid placed or more sub-criteria are applied, i. e. the <b>key</b> <b>criterion</b> is economic advantage of the offer. In order to determine/identify, which way of public procurement is more efficient, different characteristics of the evaluation process in each of the groups are compared.
