500|$|In 2004, the African American Historical and Cultural Society Museum in San Francisco {{assembled}} a Queen Califia exhibit, curated by John William Templeton, featuring works by {{artists such as}} TheArthur Wright and James Gayles; artistic interpretations of Calafia. The show displayed a 1936 treatment of Lucille Lloyd's [...] "California Allegory" [...] triptych, with Queen Califia as the central figure. Templeton said that [...] "Califia {{is a part of}} California history, and she also reinforces the fact that when Cortes named this place California, he had 300 black people with him." [...] Templeton pointed out that Columbus had a black navigator and that Africans were seen by Europeans as being culturally advanced in the 15th century. William E. Hoskins, director of the museum, said that very few people <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Queen Califia. He said, [...] "One of the things we're trying to do is let people have the additional insight and appreciation for the contributions of African Americans to this wonderful country and more specifically to the state of California", adding that [...] "the Queen Califia exhibit is particularly poignant." ...|$|E
500|$|Anahid Nazarian, Coppola's librarian, {{spoke of}} the {{historical}} inaccuracies. [...] "Preston Tucker didn't really have an assembly line; there's one in the film. He actually had five kids; there are only four in the film. Our story takes place in one year; the real story took place over four years. People who <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> will {{find a lot of}} what they call errors. I'm sure I'll be deluged with letters." [...] Nazarian's research, collected over several years, consisted of books, some 350 articles, interviews with the Tucker family, hundreds of photographs, home movies and information from the Tucker Automobile Club of America who the production company considered important arbiters of the Tucker mystique. [...] "We knew the facts," [...] she continued, [...] "but to fit the spirit of the story in a film that is exciting and has characters you love and characters you hate - that made us change a lot of things. Things like the president of the Tucker Company was a good guy really, but we needed a villain, so we made him a villain." [...] Alex Tremulis, who served as one of the historical consultants during production, is depicted as the chief car designer of the Tucker Torpedo rather than as the stylist, and the film ignores the involvement of designer Philip Egan.|$|E

2500|$|Margeaux Watson of Entertainment Weekly took a major {{swipe at}} Scherzinger {{for her role}} as lead singer. Watson said, [...] "there are two kinds of girl groups: those {{anchored}} by a superstar (the Supremes, Destiny's Child), and those made up of charismatic personalities endowed with limited individual gifts (Spice Girls, TLC). The Pussycat Dolls are neither – they're a brand, not a band. [...] 2005's multi-platinum PCD finds lead Doll Nicole Scherzinger in the spotlight, and she's no Beyoncé." [...] Scherzinger has claimed that she was responsible for both lead and backing vocals on the group's songs, with hardly anything sung by the other members. She commented, [...] "...people don't even <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>story.</b> I was in the center because I was singing. I was the one singing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hollyoak's series {{producer}} Jo Hallows described Tony as a [...] "fantastic" [...] {{character and}} opined that Pickard {{had made the}} role his own. She {{went on to say}} that Tony is [...] "easy to write for, because you can throw any story at him, both serious and frivolous, and you know that Nick will make a good job of it. He'll make you laugh and he'll also make you cry". Hallows opined that Pickard is [...] "probably the person I've cried at the most, some of the more difficult stories he's done, even though you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> that's coming up, you can't help but have a lump in your throat". Another series producer Bryan Kirkwood praised Pickard's acting skills, stating that he felt Pickard is a [...] "brilliant" [...] actor. He said he was [...] "particularly pleased in moving Tony away from the buffoon he had become over the years into heartbreaking stories such Grace's death and his relationship with Jacqui. He's a touching and sensitive actor who's always over-looked". Series producer Paul Marquess praised Pickard, saying he felt that [...] "there's only so many daft Tony stories you can do. He's so key to the show and so able and adept". Pickard's colleague Gemma Merna praised Pickard saying Pickard has [...] "had some great storylines", adding that if she was [...] "half as successful as Nick is on the show and liked as much then I would love to stay".|$|E
2500|$|Kunle Afolayan {{wanted a}} story {{set in a}} small community; he had writers submit scripts before he got to meet Tunde Babalola who {{eventually}} wrote the script for the film. The script was initially submitted with the title Dust, mainly because the story {{is set in a}} very dusty town. Even though Afolayan didn't want to do big budget projects at the time, he knew he had no choice, as he wanted to interpret the writer's vision adequately because it is a [...] "national film with a universal appeal". He expressed that he liked the story of October 1 because it is a period piece, which he had never done before and [...] "it is also significant to the present state of Nigeria". As a result, he decided to explore the film by adding his own ideas to the subsequent drafts of the script. In an interview, Afolayan pointed out that October 1 is not just an entertainment film, but also informative: [...] "For the older generation, especially those who were part of independence, {{they will be able to}} see themselves in this film. For the younger generation it's a platform for many of them who don't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Nigeria". He also stated that: [...] "We want the younger generation to know where we are coming from and the older generation to see if we are moving in the right direction".|$|E
