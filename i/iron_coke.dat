5000|$|<b>Iron</b> and <b>Coke</b> - As {{a direct}} result of the Board of Trade convention, a {{committee}} organized a company in 1881 for the manufacture of <b>iron</b> and <b>coke.</b> They raised 1 million dollars in capital for the Utah Iron Manufacturing Company. Their energies were dissipated for three years during a court battle over alleged claim-jumping by a wealthy non-Mormon. Afterwards, they reorganized the company with a new influx of capital from the LDS Church and were able to hire 20 men to move needed railway equipment from Nevada to southern Utah.|$|R
50|$|The Bee-Hive Coke Ovens, born in 1865, was {{the main}} {{operation}} of the company. Leetonia Coal & Iron would mine the surrounding areas around Leetonia for coal and then cart coal by the tons into the coke ovens on rails above the ovens. The workers would then shovel the coal into the coke ovens to cook. This would purify the coal into a purer product of coal called coke which was then shipped off to the iron mills {{to be used in}} smelting <b>iron.</b> <b>Coke</b> has a much higher temperature point than regular coal so it was preferred for use in the mills.|$|E
50|$|Workers were housed on site in {{apartment}} blocks. The {{first of}} these, {{as well as}} an apprentices' school, appeared in 1949-1952. A new neighborhood of blocks for workers began to be built in 1959 on the sloping right bank of the Strei, {{in the vicinity of the}} Streisângeorgiu Church. In 1961, due to its economic importance, Călan commune was declared a town. In 1930, the population numbered 6801; this had risen to 14,738 by 1992. A prominent player in the Romanian steel industry, the works produced gray <b>iron,</b> <b>coke,</b> coal, tar and castings, including stoves and radiators. By the 1980s, the complex employed some 8000 individuals from the town and its surroundings. Rapid development under communism gave way after the 1989 Revolution to a slow disintegration.|$|E

40|$|The {{erosion of}} hearth {{refractories}} typically governs the asset {{life of a}} blast furnace. Since operating conditions within the hearth make it practically impossible for direct measurement and visualisation, physical and mathematical models {{play an important role}} in understanding and assessing the cause-effect phenomena between the liquid <b>iron,</b> <b>coke</b> bed and refractories. A numerical model has been developed to predict the iron flow and temperature distribution within the packed bed and refractories. A number of case studies have been investigated for Port Kembla’s No. 5 blast furnace, which is entering the 15 th year of its current campaign. These case studies considered the effects of coke free layers (floating/sitting deadman), hearth deposits, coke bed fouling and localised refractory erosion. The refractory temperature distributions predicted by the model compare well with the blast furnace thermocouple measurements and as a result, the model has become a valuable predictive tool for hearth design and control.

50|$|In 1709, Abraham Darby I {{established}} a coke-fired blast furnace to produce cast <b>iron.</b> <b>Coke's</b> superior crushing strength allowed blast furnaces to become taller and larger. The ensuing availability of inexpensive iron {{was one of}} the factors leading to the Industrial Revolution. Before this time, iron-making used large quantities of charcoal, produced by burning wood. As the coppicing of forests became unable to meet the demand, the substitution of coke for charcoal became common in Great Britain, and coke was manufactured by burning coal in heaps on the ground so that only the outer layer burned, leaving the interior of the pile in a carbonized state. In the late 18th century, brick beehive ovens were developed, which allowed more control over the burning process.|$|R

5000|$|Arthur {{established}} {{a new company}} town - [...] named [...] "Middlesboro" [...] after Middlesbrough, England - [...] in the Yellow Creek Valley, and built furnaces to convert the ore into pig <b>iron,</b> and <b>coke</b> ovens to convert the mined coal into coke. Arthur then formed the Knoxville, Cumberland Gap, and Louisville Railroad to build a spur line to Middlesboro which would transport the pig <b>iron</b> and <b>coke</b> out of the valley. To house the workers needed to build a railroad tunnel through a mountainside near the Gap, Arthur set up a work camp at Cumberland Gap, Tennessee in early 1888. [...] The railroad's inaugural train ran on August 23, 1889, with several prominent Knoxvillians on board, among them Knox County judge George Andrews, Sheriff Andrew Reeder, attorney William F. Yardley, and businessmen Peter Kern, W. W. Woodruff, and Frank Hockenjos. Just outside Knoxville, however, the train derailed, killing six, including Andrews, Reeder, and Hockenjos, and injuring several others, including Arthur, Kern, and Woodruff.|$|R

50|$|Abraham Darby I, a Quaker, {{succeeded in}} {{smelting}} <b>iron</b> with <b>coke</b> as a fuel suitable for forges in 1709.

In addition, Dawley (adjacent to the east) provided mines. The furnace at Horsehay came into blast successfully on 5 May 1755. For this venture, Darby II enlisted the financial help of Thomas Goldney III (the main shareholder of the Coalbrookdale Company).|$|R
50|$|In 1707, Abraham Darby I {{patented}} {{a method}} of making cast iron pots. His pots were thinner and hence cheaper than those of his rivals. Needing a larger supply of pig iron he leased the blast furnace at Coalbrookdale in 1709. There, he made <b>iron</b> using <b>coke,</b> thus establishing the first successful business in Europe to do so. His products were all of cast iron, though his immediate successors attempted (with little commercial success) to fine this to bar iron.|$|R
