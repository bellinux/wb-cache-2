5|$|In 1955, Hartmann's mother {{wrote to}} the new West <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor,</b> Konrad Adenauer, to whom she appealed to secure his freedom. A trade {{agreement}} between West Germany and the Soviet Union was reached, and Hartmann was released along with 16,000 German military personnel {{as one of the}} last Heimkehrer. After spending 10 {{and a half years in}} Soviet POW camps, he was among the last batch of prisoners to be turned over. Returning to West Germany, he was reunited with his wife Ursula, to whom he had written every day of the war.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, a {{state funeral}} was {{conducted}} in the Washington National Cathedral, and presided over by President George W. Bush. Eulogies were given by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and both former President George H. W. Bush and President George W. Bush. Also in attendance were Mikhail Gorbachev, and many world leaders, including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Prince Charles, representing his mother Queen Elizabeth II, <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Gerhard Schröder, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and interim presidents Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, and Ghazi al-Yawer of Iraq.|$|E
5|$|Strategic discussions also {{occurred}} on the German side, with Field Marshal Erich von Manstein arguing for a mobile defence that would give up terrain and allow the Soviet units to advance, while the German forces launched a series of sharp counterattacks against their flanks to inflict heavy attrition. But for political reasons, <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Adolf Hitler insisted that the German forces go on the offensive, choosing the Kursk salient for the attack. On 15 April 1943 he authorised preparations for Unternehmen Zitadelle (Operation Citadel).|$|E

5|$|After Leo Varadkar succeeded Kenny as Taoiseach in June 2017, McEntee was {{appointed}} as Minister of State for European Affairs, a role with some {{involvement in the}} United Kingdom's Brexit process. She was one of seven women appointed to Varadkar's cabinet. Shortly after taking up the position she travelled with Varadkar to Brussels for an EU leaders summit, which included talks with <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Angela Merkel and her team. In September 2017, she addressed a conference at Dublin City University to mark {{the foundation of the}} university's Brexit Institute. The event was also attended by UK Labour Party politician Hilary Armstrong.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte was a {{favourite}} of her paternal grandparents, {{whom she}} frequently saw. King Wilhelm and Queen Augusta spoiled their granddaughter and encouraged her {{rebellion against the}} Crown Prince and Princess, and Charlotte and her brother frequently took their side in disputes with her parents. This rebellion was encouraged by the <b>German</b> <b>chancellor</b> Otto von Bismarck, who held political disagreements with the liberal Crown Prince and Princess. Charlotte also enjoyed {{a close relationship with}} her eldest brother, though they grew apart after his marriage in 1881 to Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein ("Dona"), a princess described by Charlotte as plain, slow-witted, and shy. Charlotte's relationship with Wilhelm would remain troubled as a result.|$|E
5|$|<b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg {{encouraged}} this activity. The {{effort was}} led by prominent archaeologist and historian Max von Oppenheim, who headed the new Intelligence Bureau for the East and formed the Berlin Committee, which was later renamed the Indian Independence Committee. The Berlin Committee offered money, arms, and military advisors according to plans made by the German Foreign Office and Indian revolutionaries-in-exile such {{as members of the}} Ghadar Party in North America. The planners hoped to trigger a nationalist rebellion using clandestine shipments of men and arms sent to India from elsewhere in Asia and from the United States.|$|E

5|$|In late August 1917, {{the rotary}} engine F.I {{prototype}} {{was assigned to}} Voss as his personal aircraft. In his childhood, Voss had flown Japanese fighting kites with his cousins in Krefeld; the decorations on the kites gave him the inspiration to paint the nose cowling of his triplane with two eyes, eyebrows and a moustache. The arrival of the new fighter brought celebrities visiting. On 31 August, Anthony Fokker escorted <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Georg Michaelis and Major General Ernst von Lossberg to see and film the new triplane. On 9 September, Crown Prince Wilhelm would also visit Jasta 10.|$|E
5|$|The day before, the Ottoman {{government}} had proposed to Wangenheim that a fictitious {{purchase of the}} German ships be arranged, so their presence would not compromise Ottoman neutrality. The next day the <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> had cabled Wagenheim, rejecting the idea and demanding that the Ottomans immediately join the war. The Grand Vizier accosted Wagenheim on the premature arrival of the ships and repeated the demand for a fictitious sale. The Ottoman government subsequently declared that it had purchased both ships for 80 million German marks. On 14 August, Wagenheim advised the German government {{that it would be}} best to go along with the sale, lest they risk angering the Ottomans.|$|E
5|$|The first armored cruiser to be {{designed}} by the German navy, Fürst Bismarck was an enlarged version of the s, at nearly twice the displacement and with a significantly more powerful armament. The ship was intended for overseas use, particularly in support of German colonies in Asia and the Pacific. Despite heavy political opposition, the new ship {{was approved by the}} Reichstag, and was laid down as Ersatz Leipzig in April 1896 at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel. Fürst Bismarck, named after the famous <b>German</b> <b>chancellor</b> Otto von Bismarck, was completed on 1 April 1900, at a cost of 18,945,000 Marks.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1930s {{tensions}} built between Germany and the United Kingdom {{as well as}} its allies. During late 1937, {{and throughout}} 1938, German demands for the annexation of Czechoslovakia's Sudetenland led to an international crisis. In an attempt to avoid war, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met with <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Adolf Hitler in September and brokered the Munich Agreement. The agreement averted war and allowed Germany to annex the Sudetenland. While it had been intended as an agreement to reconcile differences, and for future issues to be resolved peacefully, relations between both countries soon deteriorated. On 15 March 1939, Germany breached the terms of the agreement by invading and occupying the remnants of the Czech state.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{globalization}} grew under free trade, {{starting in}} 1860 when the United Kingdom {{entered into a}} free trade agreement with France known as the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. However, the golden age of this wave of globalization endured a return to protectionism between 1880 and 1914. In 1879, <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Otto von Bismarck introduced protective tariffs on agricultural and manufacturing goods, making Germany the first nation to institute new protective trade policies. In 1892, France introduced the Méline tariff, greatly raising customs duties on both agricultural and manufacturing goods. The United States maintained strong protectionism during most of the nineteenth century, imposing customs duties between 40 and 50% on imported goods. Despite these measures, international trade continued to grow without slowing. Paradoxically, foreign trade grew at a much faster rate during the protectionist phase of the first wave of globalization than during the free trade phase sparked by the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|In December 1970 Gomułka {{scored a}} major {{political}} victory when Poland obtained a West German recognition of the post-World War II borders. The German side secured the right to emigrate to West Germany for the residents of Poland of German identity and to help financially those who stayed by granting pensions: hundreds of thousands eventually became affected. <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Willy Brandt, who signed the agreement, also asked on his knees for forgiveness for the crimes of the Nazis (Warschauer Kniefall). His gesture was understood in Poland as being addressed to all Poles, although it was actually made {{at the site of}} the Warsaw Ghetto and was thus directed primarily toward the Jews. The notable reconciliation process between the Polish and German nations was initiated five years earlier, when the Polish Church issued its famous Letter of Reconciliation of the Polish Bishops to the German Bishops, criticized then by the Polish government.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of West <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik ("Eastern Policy") {{at the end}} of the 1960s reduced tensions between the two German states. It led to a series of treaties and agreements in the early 1970s, most significantly a treaty in which East and West Germany recognised each other's sovereignty and supported each other's applications for UN membership, although East Germans leaving for the West retained the right to claim a West German passport. Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice that objective was put aside by the West and abandoned entirely by the East. New crossing points were established and East German crossing regulations were slightly relaxed, although the fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E
5|$|The <b>German</b> <b>Chancellor</b> Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg {{authorised}} German activity against British India as World War I {{broke out}} in September 1914. Germany decided to actively support the Ghadarite plans. Using the links established between Indian and Irish residents in Germany (including Irish nationalist and poet Roger Casement) and the German Foreign Office, Oppenheim tapped into the Indo-Irish network in the United States. Har Dayal had helped organise the Ghadar party before his arrest in the United States in 1914. He however jumped bail {{and made his way}} to Switzerland, leaving the party and publications in the charge of Ram Chandra Bharadwaj, who became the Ghadar president in 1914. The German consulate in San Francisco was tasked to make contact with Ghadar leaders in California. A naval lieutenant by the name of Wilhelm von Brincken {{with the help of the}} Indian nationalist journalist Tarak Nath Das and an intermediary by the name of Charles Lattendorf established links with Bharadwaj. Meanwhile, in Switzerland the Berlin committee was able to convince Har Dayal that organising a revolution in India was feasible.|$|E
