5|$|Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, but {{continued}} to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> Harper's Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by George Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the Gettysburg Campaign, which was {{a victory for the}} Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.|$|E

Policy {{also met with}} Butch Davis, the {{head coach of the}} University of Miami's football team. After rejecting an initial offer in December, Davis accepted the job the following month. Davis had turned around Miami's football program and put the team back in championship contention; Policy and Lerner hoped he could <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> Cleveland.|$|E

5|$|One of Snedden's first actions was to readdress the paper's {{stance on}} Alaska statehood. Lathrop and the News-Miner had been {{strongly}} opposed to statehood, but after Snedden took control, he analyzed {{the issue and}} came out strongly in favor of Alaska statehood. The News-Miner continually published editorials in favor of statehood, and encouraged other newspapers across the U.S. to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> <b>In</b> 1955 and 1956, when the Alaska Constitutional Convention {{took place at the}} University of Alaska Fairbanks, the News-Miner set up special telephone lines from the convention chambers to the newspaper's office.

5|$|The US, the UK, {{and most}} other NATO {{countries}} opposed efforts to require the U.N. Security Council to approve NATO military strikes, such as the action against Serbia in 1999, while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval. The US/UK side claimed that this would undermine {{the authority of the}} alliance, and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia, and could <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> future conflicts where NATO intervention was required, thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the post-Cold War military environment, NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management.|$|E
5|$|On Wednesday, Assad sent Tlass to Moscow {{to seek a}} {{comprehensive}} air umbrella. The Soviets refused but prepared large amounts of military equipment at airfields for dispatch to Syria and sent Marshall Pavel Stepanovich Kutakhov to Syria {{to find out what}} happened to the Syrian SAMs, fearing that NATO might <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> Eastern Europe. On June 9, Assad met with American envoy Habib in Damascus and rejected his terms, demanding that Israel withdraw its forces from Lebanon as a condition for a ceasefire. US President Ronald Reagan called on Begin and Assad to accept a ceasefire effective at 6:00 AM, on June 10. By noon on Friday, when the ceasefire took effect, the IAF had shot down 82 aircraft without losing any in air combat. A year after the battle, a US fact-finding mission headed by Lieutenant-General John Chain, then deputy chief of staff for plans and operations, arrived in Israel to learn lessons from the battle.|$|E

25|$|Mathematical realism, like realism in general, {{holds that}} {{mathematical}} entities exist {{independently of the}} human mind. Thus humans do not invent mathematics, but rather discover it, and any other intelligent beings in the universe would presumably <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> <b>In</b> this point of view, there is really one sort of mathematics that can be discovered; triangles, for example, are real entities, not the creations of the human mind.|$|E

25|$|Aspect {{is unusual}} in ASL in that {{transitive}} verbs derived for aspect lose their transitivity. That is, while you can sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or she stared at me. Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E

25|$|After Russia {{moved to}} {{formally}} incorporate Crimea, some worried whether it may <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> other regions. US deputy {{national security advisor}} Tony Blinken said that the Russian troops massed on the eastern Ukrainian border may be preparing to enter the country's eastern regions. Russian officials stated that Russian troops would not enter other areas. US Air Force Gen. Philip M. Breedlove, NATO's supreme allied commander in Europe, warned that the same troops were {{in a position to}} take over the separatist Russian-speaking Moldovan province of Transnistria.|$|E
25|$|The killing was {{followed}} by an intensification of state repression; Stalin issued a decree establishing NKVD troikas which could mete out rulings without involving the courts. Just as the de-kulakisation policy had sought to rid rural areas of anti-government forces, so Stalin sought to <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> the cities and towns. In 1935, the NKVD was ordered to expel suspected counter-revolutionaries, particularly {{those who had been}} aristocrats, landlords, or businesspeople before the October Revolution. In the early months of 1935, over 11,000 people were expelled from Leningrad, to live in isolated rural areas. In 1936, Nikolai Yezhov became head of the NKVD and oversaw this intensification.|$|E
25|$|Double-linked lists {{require more}} space per node (unless one uses XOR-linking), and their {{elementary}} operations are more expensive; {{but they are}} often easier to manipulate because they allow fast and easy sequential access to the list in both directions. In a doubly linked list, one can insert or delete a node in a constant number of operations given only that node's address. To <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> a singly linked list, one must have {{the address of the}} pointer to that node, which is either the handle for the whole list (in case of the first node) or the link field in the previous node. Some algorithms require access in both directions. On the other hand, doubly linked lists do not allow tail-sharing and cannot be used as persistent data structures.|$|E

25|$|However the {{economic}} situation at the time did not permit Qasim to nationalize the IPC – western nations had boycotted Iranian oil when Mossadeq nationalized its oil company and {{could be expected to}} <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> this case. (It is likely that nationalization would have been Qasim's favored route had he had the necessary capabilities). Further, Iraqis lacked the technical and managerial capabilities to run the IPC. Qasim needed the oil revenues to run his government and to keep the military satisfied. Therefore, Qasim resorted to many other tactics including increasing transit rates at Basra by 1,200%. In response, the IPC stopped producing oil that used Basra as a shipping point. The ensuing confrontation was the lowest point in relations between the two up to this point.|$|E
25|$|In 1988–89, Philadelphia {{returned}} to the playoffs after a one-year absence, but was swept {{in the first round}} by the New York Knicks. In 1989–90, Barkley finished second in the league's MVP voting, as the Sixers won the Atlantic Division title with a 53–29 record. After defeating Cleveland {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, Philadelphia faced Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls in the second round. The 76ers fell to the Chicago Bulls in five games, and would <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> 1991 after sweeping the Bucks in the first round. In the 1991–92 season, the 76ers went 35–47 and missed the playoffs for the just the second time during Barkley's eight seasons in Philadelphia. On June 17, 1992, Barkley was traded to the Phoenix Suns for Jeff Hornacek, Tim Perry, and Andrew Lang, a deal that was met with harsh criticism.|$|E
25|$|Water deficits, {{which are}} already spurring heavy grain imports in {{numerous}} smaller countries, may soon <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>in</b> larger countries, such as China and India. The water tables are falling in scores of countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps. Other countries affected include Pakistan, Iran, and Mexico. This will {{eventually lead to}} water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even with the overpumping of its aquifers, China is developing a grain deficit. When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages. Unless population growth can be slowed quickly, it is feared that {{there may not be}} a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage.|$|E
