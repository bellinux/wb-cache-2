5|$|Across Britain, many hill forts {{fell out}} of use in the 100years {{around the turn of}} the millennium. It has been {{suggested}} that this, and the contemporary change in material culture of the Britons (such as the introduction of coinage and cemeteries and an increase in craft industries), was caused by increased interaction with the Roman Empire. The developing industries may have resulted in a shift away from the hill fort elites, whose power was based on agriculture. Such change is not as obvious in Dorset as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rest of Britain, but there is a trend for abandonment of hill forts in the area and a proliferation of small undefended farmsteads, indicating a migration of the population.|$|E
5|$|Ambondro was {{described}} {{on the basis of}} a fragmentary right mandible (lower jaw) with three teeth in it (Figure 1), interpreted as the last premolar (p-last) and the first two molars (m1 and m2). <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> collection of the University of Antananarivo as specimen UA10602. Relative to other primitive mammals, it is small. Each of the teeth has a prominent cingulum (shelf) on the inner (lingual) side. The p-last has a strong central cusp. There is a cuspule (small cusp) on the back of the tooth and probably another on the inner front corner. This tooth resembles the molars of symmetrodonts, a group of primitive mammals, but the back cusp is smaller than the metaconid of symmetrodonts.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{established}} that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, the Coldrum Stones belong to a localised regional variant of barrows produced {{in the vicinity of}} the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> best surviving condition. It lies near to both Addington Long Barrow and Chestnuts Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Three further surviving long barrows, Kit's Coty House, the Little Kit's Coty House, and the Coffin Stone, are located on the Medway's eastern side.|$|E

5|$|Brettingham's {{additional}} work in London included two more houses in St. James's Square: No. 5 for the 2nd Earl of Strafford and No. 13 for the 1st Lord Ravensworth. Lord Egremont, for whom Brettingham {{was working in}} the country at Petworth, gave Brettingham another opportunity to design a grandiose London mansion—the Egremont family's town house. Begun in 1759, this Palladian palace, known at the time as Egremont House, or more modestly as 94 Piccadilly, {{is one of the few}} great London town houses still standing. It later came to be known as Cambridge House and was the home of Lord Palmerston, and then of the Naval & Military Club; as of October 2007, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> process of conversion into a luxury hotel.|$|E

5|$|Castell y Bere is a Welsh castle near Llanfihangel-y-pennant in Gwynedd, Wales. Constructed by Llywelyn the Great in the 1220s, {{the stone}} castle was {{intended}} to maintain his authority over the local people and to defend the south-west part of the princedom of Gwynedd. In 1282 war with Edward I of England resulted {{in the death of}} Llywelyn's grandson, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, and Castell y Bere fell to English forces. Edward I expanded the castle further and established a small town beside it. In 1294 the Welsh leader Madoc ap Llywelyn mounted a major revolt and the castle was besieged and apparently burnt. Edward did not repair it and it became ruined. Today <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hands of Cadw and operated as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Chyur tree in {{the high}} {{altitude}}s of the Himalayas growing at an altitude between 500 and 1000m, known as the Indian butter tree (Diploknema butyracea), is called a Kalpavriskha, or tree of paradise {{by the people of}} the mountainous region as it yields honey, jaggery and ghee. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of an umbrella.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest than <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E

5|$|Common {{starlings}} can eat {{and damage}} fruit in orchards such as grapes, peaches, olives, currants and tomatoes or dig up newly sown grain and sprouting crops. They may also eat animal feed and distribute seeds through their droppings. In eastern Australia, weeds like bridal creeper, blackberry and boneseed {{are thought to}} have been spread by common starlings. Agricultural damage in the US is estimated as costing about US$800 million annually. This bird is not considered to be as damaging to agriculture in South Africa as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} than <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
5|$|Hemming's Cartulary is a {{manuscript}} cartulary, or collection of charters and other land records, collected by a monk named Hemming {{around the time}} of the Norman Conquest of England. The manuscript comprises two separate cartularies that were made at different times and later bound together; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> British Library as MS Cotton Tiberius A xiii. The first was composed at the end of the 10th or beginning of the 11th century. The second section was compiled by Hemming and was written around the end of the 11th or the beginning of the 12th century. The first section, traditionally titled the Liber Wigorniensis, is a collection of Anglo-Saxon charters and other land records, most of which are organized geographically. The second section, Hemming's Cartulary proper, combines charters and other land records with a narrative of deprivation of property owned by the church of Worcester.|$|E

5|$|In {{many social}} insect communities, sex is {{determined}} through haplodiploidy. Haploid male drones develop from unfertilized eggs while diploid females develop from fertilized eggs. Queens of a colony may mate {{with one or}} several drones. On average, a queen shares half of her genes with her sons, but only shares a quarter of her genes with the sons of fertile female workers. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> queen's best interests to have her own sons raised, and not the sons of workers. Workers can reproduce in many ants, bees, and wasps because male offspring come from unfertilized eggs.|$|E
