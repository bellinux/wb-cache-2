Food {{in this category}} includes all items that grow from the ground (fruits, vegetables, grains, etc.), fish, eggs, and non-biological edible items (such as water and salt). Kashrut forbids consuming mixtures of milk and meat, consuming milk and meat at the same meal, consuming dairy foods within {{a period of time}} after consuming meat (the period varies by custom), and using the same dishes for both dairy and meat. Pareve foods, being neutral, can be consumed with either dairy or meat.|$|E
5000|$|In Arabic {{and other}} eastern societies, {{sometimes}} a traditional method to protect books and scrolls was a metaphysical appeal to [...] "Kabi:Kaj," [...] the [...] "King of the Cockroaches." [...] By {{appealing to the}} king to protect a manuscript, cockroaches of less nobility (or lesser insects) would refrain from intruding on documents which could be eaten by the king only. Since many manuscripts were made with fish-glue, starch-paste, leather and other <b>edible</b> <b>substances,</b> insect appetites were a constant problem to Arabic books and scrolls. A similar technique from Syria was to name {{the first and last}} page of a document or manuscript [...] "The Page of the King of the Cockroaches", {{in the hope that the}} Cockroach King will control all other insects. Translated appeals include [...] "O Kabi:kaj, save the paper!", [...] "O Kabi:kaj, save this book from the worms!" [...] and [...] "O Kabi:kaj, do not eat this paper!" [...] "In Maghribi manuscripts, the word appears in its evidently corrupt form, [...] "Kaykataj" [...] and is clearly used as a talisman... and mentions, after a certain Muhammad al-Samiri, that when one writes [...] "Kaytataj" [...] on the first and last folio of the book, one can be sure that worms will not attack it." ...|$|E

Stains, an editioned portfolio of 75 stained sheets of paper produced and published by Ruscha in 1969, bears the traces of a variety of materials and fluids. In the portfolio of screenprints News, Mews, Pews, Brews, Stews, Dues (1970), produced at Editions Alecto, London, rhyming words appear in Gothic typeface, printed in <b>edible</b> <b>substances</b> such as pie fillings, bolognese sauce, caviar, and chocolate syrup. Ruscha has also produced his word paintings with food products on moiré and silks, since they were more stain-absorbent; paintings like A Blvd. Called Sunset (1975) were executed in blackberry juice on moiré. However, these most vibrant and varied organic colourings usually dried to a range of muted greys, mustards and browns. His portfolio Insects (1972) consists of six screen prints - three on paper, three on paper-backed wood veneer, each showing a lifelike swarm of a different meticulously detailed species. For the April 1972 cover of ARTnews, he composed an Arcimboldo-like photograph that spelled out the magazine’s title in a salad of squashed foods.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{significance}} of pica and geophagia {{as a public}} health problem is well known. The objective radiographic diagnosis of geophagia depends on the abnormal opacification of the bowel as an immediate manifestation of the condition. The chance of detectability of geophagia is highest in the colon and can be improved by using low penetration films, particularly for smaller amounts of ingested clay. Other radiologic changes frequently associated with the prolonged practice of geophagia are an atonic pattern of the colon, secondary radiographic changes due to iron-deficiency anemia and bone-age retardation. The occurrence of intestinal obstruction due to pica in the presence of preexisting bowel stricture is demonstrated. Am. J. Clin. Nuir. 28 : 1095 - 1098, 1975.

40|$|Using a speeded {{classification}} task, Walker and Walker (2012) {{demonstrated a}} cross-sensory correspondence between haptic size and surface brightness. Specifically, adult participants classified bright (dark) visual stimuli {{more quickly and}} accurately when this required them to press the smaller (bigger) of two response keys which were always hidden from view. The nature of the correspondence (i. e., small being aligned with bright), along with {{various aspects of the}} task situation, indicated that the congruity effect originated at later stages of information processing concerned with the semantic classification of stimuli and response selection. The study reported here provides additional evidence for the involvement of semantic coding. When the names of bright (white) <b>edible</b> <b>substances</b> (e. g., flour) and dark (black) inedible substances (e. g., soot) were classified according to their surface brightness, the same size-brightness congruity effect was observed. However, when the basis for classification of the substances was switched to their edibility, the congruity effect disappeared. It is therefore proposed that congruity effects based on cross-sensory correspondences can reflect interactions between the connotative meanings of elementary stimulus features (cf. Karwoski et al., 1942) ...|$|E

2500|$|Controversy arises as {{to health}} {{concerns}} surrounding the questionable classification of gum as food, particularly {{in regard to}} some alternative uses for gum base ingredients.

40|$|Rats {{exposed to}} a {{simultaneous}} compound of a flavor and sucrose subsequently exhibited a preference for the flavor over water. This preference persisted across repeated testing even though the flavor was presented {{in the absence of}} sucrose. The preference did, however, extinguish if the rats were hungry when trained or tested, or if they had been reexposed to sucrose between training and test. Though failing to extinguish the preference, presentation of the flavor outside the compound protected it from the effects of sucrose devaluation, indicating that these presentations extinguished the within-compound association between the flavor and sucrose. The authors conclude that the hedonic reaction elicited by sucrose imbues the flavor with the same hedonic properties, and these properties maintain the preference independently of the flavor–sucrose association. Associative learning is one of the mechanisms used by rats and people {{to solve the problem of}} selecting from a vast range of potentially <b>edible</b> <b>substances</b> what to accept for ingestion and what to reject (Capaldi, 1996; Rozin & Zellner, 1985). Experimental evidence for the involvement of learning in food selection was provided by the classic studies on cue-to-consequence and long delay learning in rats (e. g., Garcia, Ervin, & Koelling, 1966; Garcia & Koelling, 1966). These studies demonstrated that adverse postingestive consequences selectively condition aversions to the flavors of recently consumed foods and do so even when there are considerable delays between ingestion of the flavor conditioned stimulus (CS) and the adverse effects produced by the gastric unconditioned stimulus (US). In addition to developing aversions to flavors that signal the presence of toxins in foods, rats learn about flavors that signal the presence of nutrients in foods. For example, rats acquire prefer-ences for the flavors of foods that are rich in calories (Capaldi &...|$|E

40|$|Context : Palm {{oil from}} Elaeis guineensis is an <b>edible</b> {{nutrient}} <b>substance</b> with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. We examined its protective effect against lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) accumulation in the liver. Materials and Methods : 12 % w/w of palm oil (PO) in rat chow concentrate was fed to rats exposed to Cd (200 ppm) and Pb (100 ppm) {{in drinking water}} at different feeding regimens. PO was administered either {{at the same time}} with the metals (group 2), post-treatment after exposure (group 3) or pre-treatment before exposure (group 4) for six weeks. The heavy metal accumulations in the liver were determined using AAS. Results : Weight losses induced by these metals were significantly (P< 0. 05) reversed by PO administration. Analysis among the groups showed that post-treatment group had a significant (P< 0. 05) higher percentage protection to Cd, but same time treatment for Pb (P< 0. 05) when compared with other groups. The protective ability to PO was only significantly (P< 0. 05) increased for Pb at week 2, but showed a time-dependent significant (P< 0. 05) increase for Cd across all treatment regimens. Conclusion : PO is beneficial in reducing metal accumulation in the liver and has a higher hepatoprotective effect to Cd compared to Pb at the selected doses by possibly affecting the processes of uptake, assimilation and elimination of these metals...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 63 - 64). Pulsed electric field (PEF) is a new, emerging and a non thermal method of processing of food preservation technique, which uses pulsating electric field for the inactivation of microorganisms. The process causes a minimal effect on food quality characteristics such as smell, taste, color and texture. PEF can be especially used for processing liquid and semi-liquid <b>edible</b> food <b>substances.</b> Studies conducted on the energy requirements have concluded that PEF is an energy efficient process compared to the traditional thermal methods such as pasteurization. In this study the PEF was applied to various edible food items: raw milk, fruit juice, sugarcane extract and tap water. High energy electric field, ranging from 400 V/cm up to 1600 V/cm of frequency 50 Hz was applied and the corresponding microbial colony growth was counted.

Smells influence and modify the hedonic qualities of eating experience, and in contrast to smells not associated with food, perception of food-associated odors may activate dopaminergic brain areas. In this study, we aimed to verify previous findings related to the rewarding value of food-associated odors by means of an fMRI design involving carefully preselected odors of <b>edible</b> and non-edible <b>substances.</b> We compared activations generated by three food and three non-food odorants matching in terms of intensity, pleasantness and trigeminal qualities.

40|$|Multisensory {{processes}} are vital {{in the perception}} of our environment. In the evaluation of foodstuff, redundant sensory inputs not only assist the identification of <b>edible</b> and nutritious <b>substances,</b> but also help avoiding the ingestion of possibly hazardous substances. While it is known that the non-chemical senses interact already at early processing levels, it remains unclear whether the visual and olfactory senses exhibit comparable interaction effects. To address this question, we tested whether the perception of congruent bimodal visual-olfactory objects is facilitated compared to unimodal stimulation. We measured response times (RT) and accuracy during speeded object identification. The onset of the visual and olfactory constituents in bimodal trials was physically aligned in the first and perceptually aligned in the second experiment. We tested whether the data favored coactivation or parallel processing consistent with race models. A redundant-signals effect was observed for perceptually aligned redundant stimuli only, i. e. bimodal stimuli were identified faster than either of the unimodal components. Analysis of the RT distributions and accuracy data revealed that these observations could be explained by a race model. More specifically, visual and olfactory channels appeared to be operating in a parallel, positively dependent manner. While these results suggest the absence of early sensory interactions, future studies are needed to substantiate this interpretation...|$|R
