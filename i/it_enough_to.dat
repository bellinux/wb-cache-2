5|$|Quentin Tarantino {{had been}} working at Video Archives, a video store in Manhattan Beach, California, and {{originally}} planned to shoot the film with his friends on a budget of $30,000 in a 16mm black-and-white format, with producer Lawrence Bender playing a police officer chasing Mr. Pink. Bender gave the script to his acting teacher, whose wife gave the script to Harvey Keitel. Keitel liked <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> sign as a co-producer so Tarantino and Bender would have an easier job finding funding; with his assistance, they raised $1.5 million. Keitel also paid for Tarantino and Bender to host casting sessions in New York, where the duo found Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, and Tim Roth.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} that unionized workers raise their own wages above their natural rate {{at the expense}} of their businesses or other workers assumes that unions never raise productivity to compensate for higher wages. Unions are capable of raising productivity by reducing turnover, by increasing coordination between workers and management, and by increasing workers' motivation. Many unions raise the productivity of their workers, and some even raise <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make up for wage increases.|$|E

25|$|Amritsar — At 17:45 hrs, four Mirages {{flying from}} Sargodha {{and led by}} Wing Commander Hakimullah {{attacked}} Amritsar AB.

However, the Amritsar runway was repaired within the same night to receive detachments of Mig 21s and Su-7 that flew against Rafiqui AB the next morning.

Two Sukhois then took off from the one remaining serviceable lane of the runway, moments before it was bombed by a passing B-57.|$|E

500|$|When {{the game}} was {{localized}} for distribution in America, Capcom changed {{the title of the}} game from Rockman to Mega Man.

Most of the plays now accepted as Shakespeare's, or at least partly by Shakespeare, were also accepted as his by Hazlitt. The two notable exceptions were Titus Andronicus and Pericles, Prince of Tyre. Of the former, Hazlitt nevertheless respected Schlegel's defence of <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> quote the latter at length.

Her first name was conceived as a result of Kubo hearing the Latin name for cosmos on television, and later decided that the name really suited her since the Latin word from which her name is derived means [...] "light" [...] and Kubo sees her as [...] "a ray of light for Ichigo." [...] Shonen Jump asked in an interview if Kubo had any plans to make Ichigo and Rukia a couple, but Kubo chose neither to confirm nor deny it. After designing Rukia's zanpakutō, Kubo noted he liked it a lot and made it to be the most beautiful one from the series.|$|E
500|$|RZA sent several beats to West, {{including}} some that he cited as being edgy, {{because he felt}} that West was the type who could work well on more forceful production, including the brooding [...] "So Appalled". The song was nearly featured on Last Train to Paris, a studio album by Diddy. According to another producer on the song, No I.D., it was offered to both Jay-Z and Diddy before it leaked. West freestyled over the track for fun and found that he actually liked <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> ultimately use it himself, stating {{that it would make}} a good group song. Cyhi the Prynce's verse only appeared on the song because he [...] "tricked" [...] West. Originally he was only supposed to deliver a quick hook, but at the time West was tired and let Cyhi record his verse alone. [...] When West awoke and played back the tape, he {{was surprised to find that}} Cyhi had recorded an entire verse. Impressed with it, West decided to include it on the track anyway. The song reportedly offended M.C. Hammer, who Jay-Z references on the line [...] "I spent another 30 / Cause unlike Hammer 30 million can't hurt me".|$|E
500|$|Several {{critics have}} {{positively}} reviewed the song [...] "Gitchee Gitchee Goo" [...] from the episode, stating that it [...] "could probably have gotten radio play 20 years ago." [...] Disney as well enjoyed <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> ask the creators to write songs every episode. The song has since then made brief appearances in later episodes, either in [...] "elevator music" [...] form {{or as the}} song itself. The song was featured as an extended version on the album Disney Channel Playlist, which featured multiple songs from different Disney Channel artists. The song also {{was one of the}} twenty-six songs appearing on the series official soundtrack, released on September 29, 2009. The episode was one of several that was featured on the first volume DVD of season one titled [...] "The Fast and the Phineas." [...] In the DVD, it is paired with its production partner [...] "Are You My Mummy?" [...] Lara Bergen adapted the episode, along with the fellow season one episode [...] "Lights, Candace, Action!"

500|$|Ultimately, Lee {{spent over}} {{two and a}} half years writing To Kill a Mockingbird. The book was {{published}} on July 11, 1960. After rejecting the [...] "Watchman" [...] title, it was initially re-titled Atticus, but Lee renamed it [...] "To Kill a Mockingbird" [...] to reflect that the story went beyond just a character portrait. The editorial team at Lippincott warned Lee that she would probably sell only several thousand copies. In 1964, Lee recalled her hopes for the book when she said, [...] "I never expected any sort of success with 'Mockingbird.'...I was hoping for a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers but, at the same time, I sort of hoped someone would like <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> give me encouragement. Public encouragement. I hoped for a little, as I said, but I got rather a whole lot, and in some ways this was just about as frightening as the quick, merciful death I'd expected." [...] Instead of a [...] "quick and merciful death", Reader's Digest Condensed Books chose the book for reprinting in part, which gave it a wide readership immediately.

500|$|The {{second season}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was particularly acclaimed; {{it was named}} one of the ten best episodes of the series by The Baltimore Sun, and the Star Tribune called Williams' performance one of the ten best guest star moments in television history. The performance of Andre Braugher was also particularly praised, especially for his scene in [...] "Black and Blue", in which Pembleton persuades a suspect to confess to a murder he did not commit. Gail Pennington of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the second season was an improvement over the first, which she said was excellent but [...] "tended to demand an awful lot from viewers". Pennington said the toned down visual style and stronger emphasis on single stories better focused the show, adding: [...] "Homicide is great TV, and NBC believes in <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> give it what may be the network's best time slot." [...] Bob Langford of The News & Observer called Homicide [...] "absolutely brilliant" [...] and praised it for focusing not on the crimes but on the effects of it, as well as the realistic themes regarding race, such as concerns in [...] "Bop Gun" [...] that the murder would deter white tourists from visiting Baltimore. Langford said it was occasionally preachy, but said, [...] "Sometimes, a good sermon is what we need. Amazing that one this powerful can come from a TV show." ...|$|E
500|$|The Projected Man {{was shot}} {{at the same time}} as Island of Terror, with which it was {{released}} on a double bill. The idea of the double bill came to Richard Gordon when he ran Island of Terror for Universal Studios' executive in charge, Hi Martin. As The Projected Mans special effects were not yet finished, Gordon showed Martin Island of Terror. Martin enjoyed the film and obtained the American rights for a [...] "very large sum of money." [...] As Gordon was not keen on the idea of Island of Terror being placed at the bottom of the bill with one of Universal's other features, which he described as [...] "no good for [...] financially," [...] he proposed adding a second film, noting that The Projected Man was nearing completion. He showed an unfinished workprint of the film to see if Martin was interested, and he enjoyed <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> accept the deal. When The Projected Man was shown in theatres in the United States, it was cut thirteen minutes shorter than the original British print, due to the fact that Universal felt the opening scene, which depicted a rehearsal for an experiment which came later in the film, was [...] "repetitive." [...] They also did not want a double bill with a duration of over three hours, and did not want to edit Island of Terror, so The Projected Man was trimmed to provide an exact 180-minute running time.|$|E

500|$|... "At Long Last Leave", {{which is}} the 500th episode of The Simpsons, was written by Michael Price. The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean has {{described}} it as [...] "a tribute to people who love the show." [...] Being a fan of musical theater, Price titled the episode {{in reference to the}} Cole Porter song [...] "At Long Last Love". Price did not write [...] "At Long Last Leave" [...] with the intention of it becoming the 500th episode; that decision was made afterwards when the staff members realized the story offered an opportunity for a look-back at the history of the Simpson family. He {{said in an interview with}} the magazine Channel Guide that he was [...] "deeply honored" [...] when his episode was selected for the milestone. As acknowledged by Price in that interview, the plot of the episode features similarities to the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie, in which the Simpsons are forced to flee to Alaska after Homer angers the townspeople in Springfield by polluting a lake. However, Price commented that [...] "I think it's different from the movie in that it sort of does reference back the entire history of the show, the collective experience of Springfield vis-a-vis the Simpsons, whereas the movie they were forced to run away due to that very specific thing". He further noted that despite the similarities [...] "we [...] liked <b>it</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> go with it anyway." [...] The plot was first announced to the press at the Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California on July 23, 2011, during a panel with the cast and crew of The Simpsons.|$|E
