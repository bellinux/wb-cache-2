40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access. Purpose: Assessing {{biological}} maturity {{in studies of}} children is challenging. Sex-specific regression equations developed using anthropometric measures are widely used to predict somatic maturity. However, prediction accuracy was not established in external samples. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the fit of these equations, assess for overfitting (adjusting as necessary), and calibrate using external samples. Methods: We evaluated potential overfitting using the original Pediatric Bone Mineral Accrual Study (PBMAS; 79 boys and 72 girls; 7. 5 – 17. 5 yr). We assessed change in R 2 and standard error of the estimate (SEE) {{with the addition of}} predictor variables. We determined the effect of within-subject correlation using cluster-robust variance and fivefold random splitting followed by forward-stepwise regression. We used dominant predictors from these splits to assess predictive abilities of various models. We calibrated using participants from the Healthy Bones Study III (HBS-III; 42 boys and 39 girls; 8. 9 – 18. 9 yr) and Harpenden Growth Study (HGS; 38 boys and 32 girls; 6. 5 – 19. 1 yr). Results: Change in R 2 and SEE was negligible when later predictors were added during step-by-step refitting of the original equations, suggesting overfitting. After redevelopment, new models included age × sitting height for boys (R 2, 0. 91; SEE, 0. 51) and age × height for girls (R 2, 0. 90; SEE, 0. 52). These models calibrated well in external samples; HBS boys: b 0, 0. 04 (0. 05); b 1, 0. 98 (0. 03); RMSE, 0. 89; HBS girls: b 0, 0. 35 (0. 04); b 1, 1. 01 (0. 02); RMSE, 0. 65; HGS boys: b 0, − 0. 20 (0. 02); b 1, 1. 02 (0. 01); RMSE, 0. 85; HGS girls: b 0, − 0. 02 (0. 03); b 1, 0. 97 (0. 02); RMSE, 0. 70; where b 0 equals calibration <b>intercept</b> (<b>standard</b> error (SE)) and b 1 equals calibration slope (SE), and RMSE equals root mean squared error (of prediction). We subsequently developed an age × height alternate for boys, allowing for predictions without sitting height. Conclusion: Our equations provided good fits in external samples and provide an alternative to commonly used models. Original prediction equations were simplified with no meaningful increase in estimation error...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare T {{results in}} normal and hirsute women, {{obtained}} by different laboratories employing {{the same or}} different methods, including an in-home RIA, and the gold standard method LC-MS/MS. In addition, T results were referred to a curve obtained by 6 different pools that had been prepared {{on the basis of}} LC-MS/MS results. Design: Prospective study Setting: Hormone Determination Laboratory, Hospital Italiano, La Plata, and private practice of each participant laboratory. Patient(s) : Blood samples were obtained from 78 individuals sorted into 3 groups, namely, normal men (n: 39), normal women (n: 24) and hirsute women (n: 15) Interventions(s) : None Main Outcome Measure(s) : To evaluate if the results obtained in each lab for each serum sample by the methods currently employed in our country are significantly different from those obtained by LC-MS/MS (Gold standard) Result(s) One out of the 24 NW showed high T values by LC - MS/MS. In each lab, except in 1 (Architect) T results of this serum sample were normal. Two out of the 15 hirsute patients showed normal T values (LC - MS/MS). Method and number of labs -shown between brackets- and percentages of normal T results (false negatives) are described for each method as follows: Chemiluminescence: Axsym - Abbott (Axn) - (3) 85, Architect - Abbott - (Arch); (2) 70; Immulite - Siemmens - (IMM); (2) 42; Electrochemiluminescence - Elecsys - Roche- ((EQL); (4) 52; Fluorescent enzymatic - Vidas - Bio-Merieux - (Vidas) (1) 69; Manual coated tube radioimmunoassay (RIA) : RIA - Siemmens Coat-a-Count (RIA S); (3) 64; RIA - DSL Inc (RIA DSL); (1) 31; RIA - DIASource - (DiaS); (1) 31; and in-Home RIA (in-H) (1) 12. Statistically significant differences were obtained between different methods and against LC MS/MS. In-H method is the one that comes closest to 1 on the Weighted Deming regression and closest to zero on the SD <b>intercept,</b> (<b>standard</b> deviation of the constant in the straight line equation) indicating that the values match those obtained by LC - MS/MS. The values recorded by the various methods employed showed no significant modifications when plotted against a secondary standard curve. Conclusion(s) This indicates that the techniques in current use in our area underestimate hyperandrogenemia in these patients. Discrepancies are not due to the various calibration curves proposed in the corresponding commercial kits. The fact that the In-H technique affords finer results while employing a larger serum volume suggests that the disparities among the various commercial methods result from their limited sensitivity to the sample volumes they process. No financial conflicts of interest exist. El diagnóstico de hiperandrogenemia requiere la demostración de niveles aumentados de Testosterona Total (TT) en suero. Los inmuno ensayos comerciales dan resultados divergentes a niveles bajos de TT como los obtenidos en mujeres. Valoramos los niveles de TT en 24 mujeres normales (MN) y 15 hirsutas (MH) en 18 laboratorios por métodos comúnmente empleados en nuestro medio, Quimioluminiscencia: Axsym - Abbott (Axn) - (3), Architect - Abbott - (Arch); (2); Immulite - Siemmens - (IMM); (2); Electroquimioluminiscencia - Elecsys - Roche- ((EQL); (4); Enzimático acoplado a fluorescencia Vidas - Bio-Merieux - (Vidas) (1), Radioinmunoiensayo en tubo recubierto (RIA) : RIA - Siemmens (RIA S); (3) 64; RIA - DSL Inc (RIA DSL); (1) 31; RIA - DIASource - (DiaS); (1) 31; y un metodo desarrollado en uno de los laboratorios (in-H) (1). El número entreparéntesis indica elnúmero de laboratorios que emplearon la misma técnica,y comparamos los resultados por LC MS/MS. Comparativamente a LC MS/MS los niveles fueron en todas las muestras significativamente más bajos por AXS y en 18 de las 24 MN por DiaS. En 7 casos; 3 por RIA S, 2 por IMM y 1 por EQL y Arch los valores de TT fueron superiores al límite superior de sus respectivos métodos. En todos los casos se obtuvo una gran variación entre los mismos y con diferentes métodos. Trece de las 15 MH tuvieron niveles altos de TT por LC MS/MS. De las MH con TT aumentada de acuerdo a la determinación por LC MS/MS entre el 12 y el 85 % de las mismas por los distintos métodos fueron normales, indicando que en la mayoría de los métodos habitualmente utilizados en nuestro medio subvaloran la hipernadrogenemia en estas pacientes. Estas diferencias se hacen más notorias a niveles más bajos de TT (Se obtuvieron valores normales en el 71 % de los casos con valores de TT entre 0. 47 y 0. 74 ng/ml y en el 38 % de los casos, con niveles de TT mayor a 0. 98 ng/ml). En 9 muestras se determinó la TT empleando una curva en el rango de 0. 21 a 6. 44 ng/ml preparada con de una mezcla de 78 sueros cuyos valores fueron obtenidos por LC MS/MS. No se obtuvo una modificación significativa de los valores indicando que la diferencia entre los distintos métodos no es debida a las diferentes curvas de calibración de los kit comerciales. En conclusión ninguno de los métodos mayormente empleados en nuestro medio son aceptables para la evaluación de niveles menores a 1. 5 ng/ml...|$|E

40|$|The <b>intercept</b> of <b>standard</b> Single Index and Conditional Single Index models, the {{so-called}} alpha, {{is often used}} to evaluate the long-run performance of managed portfolios. However, this measure is not always appropriate for detecting the presence and impact of active management strategies. Based on the conditional factor models literature, we introduce a Conditional Single Index model where the time-varying alpha and beta parameters depend only on the past history of the underlying portfolio returns and of the benchmark returns. The dynamics of the parameters have two components: the first describes the long-term behaviour of the alpha and beta, whereas the second is associated with the short-term performance of the underlying portfolio. The interpretation of parameters allows the identification of portfolio managers who implement active management strategies. An application on a set of 1300 U.

Beer’s law was obeyed over the concentration range 8. 0 – 180 μg/ml with the detection limit of 1. 67 μg/ml for nicardipine and 8. 0 – 110 μg/ml with the detection limit of 1. 748 μg/ml for isradipine.

40|$|Recent {{concerns}} about the very large next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) corrections to the BFKL equation are addressed {{by the introduction of}} a physical rapidity-separation parameter ∆. At the leading logarithm (LL) this parameter enforces the constraint that successive emitted gluons have a minimum separation in rapidity, yi+ 1 −yi> ∆. The most significant effect is to reduce the BFKL Pomeron <b>intercept</b> from the <b>standard</b> result as ∆ is increased from 0 (standard BFKL). At NLL this ∆-dependence is compensated by a modification of the BFKL kernel, such that the total dependence on ∆ is formally next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic.

40|$|Linear {{estimation}} of cold magnetic field quality based on warm multipole measurements is being {{considered as a}} quality control method for SSC production magnet acceptance. To investigate prediction uncertainties associated with such an approach, axial-scan (Z-scan) magnetic measurements from SSC Prototype Collider Dipole Magnets (CDM`s) have been studied. This paper presents a preliminary evaluation of the explanatory ability of warm measurement multipole variation on the prediction of cold magnet multipoles. Two linear estimation methods are presented: least-squares regression, which uses the assumption of fixed independent variable (xi) observations, and the measurement error model, which includes measurement error in the xi`s. The influence of warm multipole measurement errors on predicted cold magnet multipole averages is considered. MSD QA is studying warm/cold correlation to answer several magnet quality control questions. How well do warm measurements predict cold (2 kA) multipoles? Does sampling error significantly influence estimates of the linear coefficients (slope, <b>intercept</b> and residual <b>standard</b> error) ?

The method presented by Voppel at the IAGA Assembly of Grenoble (1975) and developed by Schulz and Voppel at the IAGA Assembly of Edinburgh (1981) is based on simultaneous measurements taken at 02 : 00 UT, which coincides with the period least disturbed by Sq associated currents on central European longitudes. A selected list of ten least disturbed days per month is provided by the Niemegk (initially Wingst) Geomagnetic Observatory which gathers the corresponding momentary values from the collaborating institutions. This method can be applied to detect fluctuations or jumps in geomagnetic standards. Independent techniques, like linear regression and axial <b>intercept</b> of the <b>standard</b> deviation of the mutual differences of monthly mean values, have been applied to the magnetic elements of Ebro Observatory (EBR) for the period 1997 – 2001.

40|$|Background: Vitamin D is {{important}} to health and disease. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSMS) is considered the most accurate technology for quantification of serum 25 -hydroxyvitamin D (25 OHD) {{which is the best}} biomarker for estimating vitamin D nutritional status. Methods: Serum was mixed with acetonitrile containing hexadeuterated 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 (d 6 - 25 OHD 3) and centrifuged 10  min at 15, 634 ×g. The supernatant was injected onto a turbulent flow preparatory column then transferred to a polar endcapped C 18 analytical column. The mass spectrometer was set for positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. Results: The analytical cycle time was 5. 5  min. Inter- and intra-assay CV for both analytes across three concentrations ranged from 3. 8 % to 14. 2 %. The method was linear from 3. 0 to 283. 6  nmol/L for 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 3 (25 OHD 3) and 4. 6 to 277. 9  nmol/L for 25 -hydroxyvitamin D 2 (25 OHD 2), with an accuracy of 88. 7 %– 118. 7 % and 90. 7 %– 100. 3 %, respectively. No carryover or ion suppression was observed.

40|$|Standardization of {{the body}} area for scale {{sampling}} for growth studies of fish becomes more essential if the a value in the Fraser-Lee equation is to be standardized as suggested by Carlander (1982). In a study on yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from West Okoboji Lake and Clear Lake in Iowa, the body area located {{at the tip of}} the pectoral fin below the lateral line was found to be the best area for scale sampling. This area exhibited the lowest variability in scale size and the lowest frequency of regenerated scales of the 10 areas sampled. The optimum number of scales to be sampled from the best area was three scales if at least one readable scale is sought. No significant difference in the body-scale relationship was found between sexes nor among the four seasons in which fish were sampled. There was a significant difference in the a value of the regression equation between West Okoboji and Clear Lake samples. The number of scales along the lateral line did not differ significantly among various fish lengths nor between sexes or the two sampled populations. The scale shape (scale radius/diameter ratio) changed in young fish as the fish grew in length until a total length of about 100 mm was reached, beyond which the scale shape remained constant. This feature of change in the scale shape contributes to curvilinearity in the body-scale relationship in young fish. Key scales sampled in two previous studies varied more in scale radius and in body-scale relationship than scales sampled from the best area;Reference;Carlander, K.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Sandstone reservoirs deeper then 3200 m (10, 500 ft) are potentially rich sources of hydrocarbon in the Texas Gulf Coast. This study focused on deep potential reservoirs in the Edna Field, located in Jackson Co, TX. Due to lack of well control, Amplitude Variation with Offset (AVO) analysis was used on 2 sands located between 10, 500 ft and 14, 000 ft to investigate potential hydrocarbon charge and to validate if the bright spots are hydrocarbon associated. Before AVO analysis began, a prestack time migration (PSTM) processing flow was applied to the dataset to assure proper reflector alignment in the prestack gathers. This is done to optimize the AVO analysis. Schlumberger's processing package Seismos? was used for the processing. In Seismos?, the f-k migration module was used to produce two data volumes: a Multi-Value Grid (MVG) and a Single Value Grid (SVG). A MVG allows for multiple values to exist at the same x-y-z point in space. This allows for each offset plane to be analyzed. A SVG has one value at each x-y-z point in space. This represents a conventionally stacked seismic volume. After PSTM, the dataset was repicked to update sand geometries. As with the seismic volume before reprocessing, both sands contained bright spots that conformed to structure. With the PSTM dataset and updated interpretation, both sands were analyzed for the AVO anomalies. On each sand, <b>standard</b> <b>intercept</b> (A) and gradient (B) techniques were performed (gradient analysis, product plots, change in Poisson's ratio). In addition to this, the Geostack technique of Smith and Gidlow (1987) was done. The A&B techniques and Geostack technique for the 10, 500 ft sand resulted in anomalies that agreed with all the bright spots in the conventionally processed data. The results for the 14, 000 ft sand were more ambiguous. This uncertainty was due to lack of offset for depth and low fold {{at the edge of the}} survey where the sand was positioned. Intercept and gradient techniques did not support the location of the bright spots in the conventionally processed data...|$|R
40|$|The use of hard {{structures}} to derive ecological information about fish populations {{is a fundamental}} tool in fisheries assessment, specifically the back-calculation of fish lengths. This study highlights the potential errors associated with correction factors (c) because of poor sampling and provides a validation of (c) values. In addition, classical fisheries assumptions {{about the relationship between}} scale radius and fish body length were tested. As a result, variability or error of correction factors can be reduced by having a minimum of 30 samples with at least 4 age classes represented. Alternatively the (c) provided {{can be used as a}} standard (c) factor for each species, eliminating the variance caused by poor sampling. Finally, the development of <b>standard</b> <b>intercept</b> values (based on observation of juvenile fish) should be promoted to replace or validate mathematically derived (c). The ability to accurately determine the age and growth of fish is an important tool in fishery biology and therefore it is fundamental to this work that all steps should be taken to increase the accuracy of back-calculated length-at-age data and account for size when fish lay down scales. To account for potential error associated with a correction factor, larval fish were routinely sampled to identify patterns of squamation, providing preliminary reference data for correction factors used in back-calculation of fish length-at-age. Determination of the length at squamation for more specimens will allow for the derivation of standard correction factors for each species that can be used across the species’ distribution. Geometric morphometric (GM) analysis of fish scales has been shown to be a good discriminator of genera using a fixed landmark approach. However, freshwater fish scales are often irregular in shape; therefore it is not possible to identify identical locations on all individuals. This study provides evidence that scale morphology can be used to discriminate riverine fish species. The analysis of fish scale morphology is inexpensive, quick, non-destructive, and informative and could easily be added to existing monitoring programmes. This study highlights the potentially important and opportunistic information that can be gained from the GM analysis of fish scales. It is therefore anticipated that this study will be fundamental in shaping future fish population assessments. It is recognised amongst scientists that fish growth rates vary across a catchment, with species typically achieving greater growth rates in their ‘preferred’ habitats. Similarly, previous authors have identified that growth variation exists for different species and populations. This study has found that the geographic location of a river/region influences the growth rates of freshwater fishes commonly found in England. The method of constructing regional growth curves and subsequent statistical analysis discussed in this study should be adopted by fisheries scientists, because current national growth rates may be unachievable in specific regions. Furthermore, current national curves are inappropriate for growth and population analysis because they may be biased by an individual river and/or region. This study is one of the few studies to examine the differences between regional recruitment success, and found similarities and differences at both the regional and national level. With recruitment success a key requirement of monitoring fish populations under the WFD, it is hoped the information provided here will aid fisheries scientists to understand the factors affecting regional and national recruitment success. Studies on the impact of climate change on fish populations have typically focused on suggesting, rather than predicting, the effects on lentic species rather than lotic species. Furthermore, these studies often deal with American rather than European ecosystems. To address this, predicted changes in the climate of the UK were used to model likely influences on fish populations, expressed as the length of young of year (YOY) fish achieved by the end of the first growth period (May-September), juvenile and adult growth (annual growth increment, AGI) and recruitment success (year class strength, YCS), for three cyprinid fish. This study found that climate change is likely to increase the propensity for cyprinid fish to thrive, although the exact mechanism will depend on inter-annual variability in temperature rises and the timing of flow events. Notwithstanding the limitations of this study, it provides ecologists with a greater understanding of climate change and its potential impact on European, lotic fish populations...|$|R
40|$|Until recently, data, technology, and {{practice}} have limited travel behavior research {{in its ability}} to uniquely capture individual-level details of urban environments. While previous studies have relied primarily on aggregate, zonal averages homogeneously attributed to unique individuals, this dissertation presents methods to more closely align measures of the urban environment with the individual as the unit of analysis. In short, disaggregated data for disaggregated analyses. Furthermore, previous studies have often focused on the immediate areas (1 / 4 - to 1 / 2 -mile radii) around trip origins and destinations, while little focus {{has been paid to the}} unique characteristics of the urban environment in between. In response, this research pioneers the use of a new spatial unit of analysis, the "individual access corridor" (IAC), to better understand how people may be influenced by certain urban design, land use, or transport characteristics experienced along their journey to a certain destination (e. g., stores, mixed use developments, schools, and transit stations). The primary goal of this research is to develop and test new methods to measure the urban environment. Three core principles (resolution, respondent, replicability) comprise the central evaluative framework guiding the exploration and development of these new methods. They are introduced in this dissertation as the " 3 R principles of methodological development. " They guide the use of the IAC to capture high-resolution information about the urban environment (land use activity, transport access, and traveler perceptions) that can be uniquely attributed to each individual survey respondent in a replicable manner. This information, in turn, can support reliable and valid analyses of the influence of the urban environment on consumer behavior that are meaningful, rigorous, and generalizable. The secondary goal of this research is to test these new measures as inputs for travel behavior analyses of a relatively <b>standard</b> <b>intercept</b> travel survey [...] the 2008 Station Profile Survey for the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system. Improving measures for these analyses is important because substantial effort and money is currently being spent on influencing traveler behavior in suburban/non-CBD areas, and for trips to transit. As most morning commuters across the U. S. drive to rapid transit stations, and over relatively short distances, substantial sustainability benefits could be realized by coaxing even a small fraction of these drivers to use "green" non-motorized travel (NMT) modes of bicycling and walking. As well as providing useful insights into designs and policies that support NMT, this study of rapid transit access behavior serves as a "proof of concept" for the development and application of the new methods to measure the urban environment explored in this research. In terms of its primary goal, this research shows that capturing high-resolution information of the urban environment can be uniquely attributed to each individual survey respondent in a replicable manner to support both reliable and valid analyses of consumer behavior. Reliability of these new methods and measures is determined by: 1) their ability to objectively and uniformly capture and calculate factors of interest; and 2) their provision of similar results through repeated experiments. Validity is established via: 1) a thorough in-depth review of empirical research, literature, and urban theory to identify particular aspects of the urban environment they represent; and 2) an examination of the findings emerging from numerous models, with respect to interpretability, sensibility and usefulness. Specific achievements include the following:*	This research supports the use of the IAC to examine the unique intermediate area of a trip between its origin and destination, especially when examining NMT behavior (bicycling and walking). *	This research enriches our understanding of how to measure and analyze land use activity, beyond the currently used measures of "diversity", where entropy indices have been widely used as a proxy for land use mixture. Specifically, this research tests the best methods for managing vast amounts of complicated land use information, classified at the parcel-level, to be meaningfully applied to analyses of consumer behavior. *	This research complements the current body of literature on travel behavior and the built environment by more formally recognizing and including measures of the functional/operational qualities of urban environments, as well as measures of physical infrastructure, urban form, and "perceptual qualities" (Ewing et al., 2006; Ewing & Handy, 2009). *	This research provides valuable insight on transportation policies and urban design practices that will help communities and regions move more deliberately toward sustainability objectives, such as reducing auto use, GHG emissions, and congestion, while simultaneously improving air quality, street livability, the building of social capital, and enhancing opportunities for physical activity. In terms of the second goal of this research [...] testing the relationship of these new measures of the urban environment to rapid transit access travel behavior [...] they are proven to support reliable and valid findings that provide useful, nuanced insight into the influence of the urban environment on rapid transit access mode choice. Specifically, the findings suggest that certain policies and design characteristics of the individual access corridors (IACs) to rapid transit could increase the likelihood that one will either walk or bicycle (thus supporting the achievement of sustainability benefits) if:*	Access corridors are composed of buildings that are at a human scale, are located close to the street (giving them a stronger sense of enclosure), and have distinct, "visually rich" urban form characteristics that express both complexity and imageabilty. o	This is supported by the finding of a strong negative relationship between the use of an NMT mode to access rapid transit, and the presence of larger ("big box") parcels, and auto-supporting land uses, such as parking lots, and road & freeway rights-of-way (ROW) along a commuter's IAC. *	Communities are designed with narrower, well connected streets and/or more direct walking and bicycling paths. o	This is supported by the finding of a strong positive association between the use of an NMT mode to access rapid transit with route directness. It is also supported by strong negative relationship between NMT rapid transit access and the amount of land in auto-supporting land uses such as parking lots, and road & freeway rights-of-way (ROW), along a commuter's IAC. *	Small, personal service retail opportunities are provided. o	This supported by the finding of a strong positive relationship between NMT access and small retail/mixed uses along a commuter's IAC. Finally, the methods and measurements explored and developed in this dissertation can be applied in a wide range of urban settings and toward a better understanding of the influence of important characteristics of the urban environment on consumer behavior as it relates to a broad array of sustainability objectives...|$|R
