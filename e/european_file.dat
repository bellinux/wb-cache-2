The day that Enron filed for bankruptcy, the employees were told to pack their belongings and were given 30 minutes to vacate the building.

First to significantly enhance the JEFF- 3 release by the addition of an activation file. Second to considerably increase its usage by using a recognised, official file format so allowing existing plug-in processes to be effective and third to move towards a universal nuclear data file in contrast to the current separate general and special purpose files. The format chosen for the JEFF- 3. 0 /A file uses reactions cross sections (MF- 3), cross sections (MF- 10) and multiplicities (MF- 9). The report is available online o...|$|R
50|$|Instructors {{from the}} United Kingdom and Ireland, {{countries}} within the European Union, {{do not need}} any visas {{to work within the}} EU, which reduces demand for non-EU teachers. Immigration laws require that non-EU job applicants submit documents from their home countries in person after the <b>European</b> employer <b>files</b> an officially documented job offer. If the worker has traveled to Europe to find the job, this means they must return home and wait for some time. Following the process correctly does not guarantee getting a visa. Many private-sector employers do not subsidise them at all, because they are able to hire the staff easily from the EU countries.|$|R
