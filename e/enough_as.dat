5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in 1817, {{the son of a}} London musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E

Karthik scored 183 and 150 in the Duleep Trophy final against West Zone, becoming the third player after Lalchand Rajput and Yuvraj Singh to score centuries in both innings of a Duleep Trophy final. However, it was not <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> Yusuf Pathan scored an unbeaten 210 from only 190 balls to set a new world record for a successful run-chase.|$|E
5|$|Wanting to {{participate}} in the Olympics again, Anderson did what he could to play at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. He negotiated a clause with his team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, to grant him the right to play for Team Canada. This was not <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> Anderson also had to obtain permission from the league. The league had instituted a policy that only players with less than one year of National Hockey League experience could join and therefore turned down his request. The league's decision caused an outrage in Canada. Canada won silver as they lost the gold medal game to Sweden.|$|E

5|$|After {{failing to}} qualify {{on the final}} day of the 2009 campaign, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment said {{anything}} short of a playoff spot in 2010 would be unacceptable. With that directive, former director of soccer Mo Johnston hired Preki and made wholesale changes to the roster to reflect the U.S. Hall of Famer's plan to play a tough, defensive style. Despite scoring troubles, TFC played well at the start, going undefeated in seven games at one time. The team struggled following the World Cup break. Sensing problems in the locker room and to try to salvage the season, MLSE dismissed both Johnston and Preki on September 14, naming Earl Cochrane interim director of soccer and Nick Dasovic interim coach. The players responded to Dasovic's more open flexible style, but it wasn't <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> the club was eliminated from playoff contention with three games left in the season. Off-field issues with season-seat holders over the 2011 season ticket package added to the fans' frustrations, forcing MLSE to hold a series of town hall meetings.|$|E
5|$|After his {{establishment}} in Aleppo, in winter 945–946, Sayf al-Dawla resumed the old Muslim custom of launching annual raids into Byzantine territory. This first operation was of limited scope and {{was followed by}} a prisoner exchange. Warfare on Byzantium's eastern frontiers then subsided for a couple of years, and recommenced only in 948. Initially, the Byzantines were led by the Domestic of the Schools (commander-in-chief) Bardas Phokas the Elder, but although he was capable <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> a subordinate commander, his tenure as commander-in-chief proved largely a failure. In 948–950 the Byzantines scored a few successes, sacking the border fortresses of Hadath and Marash. Bardas' second son, Leo, distinguished himself in these years, especially in November 950, when he ambushed Sayf al-Dawla, who had previously defeated his father in battle, in a mountain pass; Sayf al-Dawla lost 8,000 men and barely escaped himself.|$|E
5|$|As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in {{the first}} round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The series drew much media {{attention}} as Vince Carter, a former Raptor who left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances two seasons ago, was now back at the ACC as a Net. In the opening game, while Carter was constantly booed by the home crowd and was not an offensive threat, Toronto's inexperience was evident as they too struggled offensively and were down 65–78 going into the fourth quarter. A late rally by Toronto in the fourth quarter was not <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> they eventually lost 91–96. The Raptors won game 2 89–83 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. The Nets won games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced a game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5. In that game, the Raptors set two post-season franchise records: most number of points going into halftime and biggest lead for a half. The attendance for the game was also a franchise record for a playoff game. In game 6, however, New Jersey won 98–97, sealing the series 4–2 and sending Toronto out of the first round.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{prosperity}} the dock afforded the city, within 20 {{years of its}} construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle. Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000tonnes, {{by the start of}} the 20th century only 7% of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels. The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large <b>enough,</b> <b>as</b> its narrow entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it. Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally steamships could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than sailing ships, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development. Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained {{an integral part of the}} dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the pump house was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.|$|E
5|$|From 1979, Wark was {{selected}} to play for his country, usually as a defender, eventually winning 29 caps for Scotland and scoring seven goals. Jock Stein was the Scotland manager who gave him his debut, in a game held on 19 May 1979, a British Home Championship match against Wales at Ninian Park; Scotland lost 3–0. Wark scored his first international goal a week later on 26 May, again in a British Home Championship game, this time against England at Wembley. Wark's opening effort was not <b>enough,</b> <b>as</b> Scotland were defeated 3–1. A week later Wark played for Scotland in a friendly against Argentina at Hampden Park. However, the game is best remembered {{for the performance of}} Diego Maradona who scored his first international goal and whose performance led Argentina to a comfortable 3–1 win over the Scots.|$|E
5|$|George Frederic Watts {{was born}} in London in 1817, {{the son of a}} musical {{instrument}} manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823 and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Meanwhile, his father's strict evangelical Christianity led to both a deep knowledge of the Bible and a strong dislike of organised religion. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and six years later was proficient <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> an artist to earn a living as a portrait painter and cricket illustrator. Aged 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. In 1837 Watts was commissioned by Greek shipping magnate Alexander Constantine Ionides to copy a portrait of his father by Samuel Lane; Ionides preferred Watts's version to the original and immediately commissioned two more paintings from him, allowing Watts to devote himself full-time to painting.|$|E
40|$|In {{developing}} {{a theory of}} the first appropriation of natural resources {{from the state of}} nature John Locke tells us that persons must leave <b>enough</b> and <b>as</b> good for others. Detailing exactly what this restriction requires divides right and left libertarians. Briefly, right libertarians interpret <b>enough</b> and <b>as</b> good as requiring no or very minimal restrictions on the first appropriation of natural resources, whereas left libertarians interpret <b>enough</b> and <b>as</b> good as requiring everyone be entitled to an equal share of unappropriated resources, able to claim no more beyond this equal share. This paper approaches the right versus left libertarian debate by {{developing a}} formal model that examines the welfare properties of different interpretations of the Lockean proviso. The model shows that underlying philosophical justifications for left libertarianism, when plausible assumptions hold, will be better served by a right libertarian proviso rather than a left libertarian one. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong <b>enough.</b> <b>As</b> a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings of fear and survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, he {{returned}} to Ramsbottom as their professional for a second season, with more effect. He took 83 wickets at 9.19 and scored 519 runs at 37.07 in 20 matches. He scored five fifties including a best of 66, and took eight five-wicket innings hauls including a best of 9/47 against Church as well as 7/27 against Lowerhouse. These performances earned him notice, and in late 2005, he appeared as a late-season overseas player substitute for Lancashire, {{and became the first}} overseas Lancashire player to take ten wickets on their debut, with 10/168 against Essex. This 5/93 and 5/75 helped Lancashire to an eight-wicket win, and in his only other first-class match, he took 4/43 and 2/49 was not <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> the Roses went down to Leicestershire by four runs. His sixteen wickets at 16.25 placed him second on the season's bowling averages, and helped the team to be promoted from Second Division. In two one-day games, Kartik took five wickets at 13.40.|$|E
5|$|In January 1971, with Bobby Moore, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, Greaves was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool. On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves and his teammates had been informed {{by members of the}} press that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch and the likelihood of frost that night. Believing {{that there would be no}} game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match went ahead and West Ham lost 4–0. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the drinking or the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good <b>enough.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club.|$|E

5|$|On {{the next}} matchday, Juventus {{played host to}} Newcastle on 1 October and Del Piero hit a brace to help his club {{maintain}} the top spot in their group. Juventus advanced to the second group stage where the club managed to progress, along with Manchester United, on goal differential over FC Basel and Deportivo de La Coruña. Juventus then saw off Barcelona in the quarter-finals through an extra time goal by Marcelo Zalayeta, and faced Spanish opposition again in the likes of defending champions Real Madrid in the semi-finals. The triumvirate attacking partnership proved wonders for Juventus, as the team overturned a 2–1 first leg deficit to record a 4–3 aggregate win as all three attacking stars netted in a 3–1 home win in the second leg. Juventus faced Italian rivals Milan in the Final in Manchester on 28 May 2003. After a goalless 120 minutes, the tie went to a penalty shoot-out, where Del Piero finished his spot-kick, but it wasn't <b>enough,</b> <b>as</b> Juventus fell 3–2 in the shoot-out.|$|E
5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute <b>enough</b> <b>as</b> benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
5|$|Partnering Colombian {{international}} and fellow newcomer Luis Amaranto Perea in central defence, Pablo contributed to Atlético achieving the third best defensive {{record in the}} 2004–05 La Liga season; only Barcelona and Real Madrid conceded fewer goals.

His performances earned him selection for the senior national team, in a friendly against England in November, and reported interest from major clubs. Both he and Perea were given a pay rise and a contract extension until 2009. In 2005–06, Pablo was a fixture for both club and country.
