50|$|While Wallonia {{was famous}} for its steel industry, the Campine region became renowned for its non ferrous metallurgies. The Campine region was {{scarcely}} populated in the 19th century and with the availability of canals, the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> and cheap labor, several metallurgies were established in the region. In 1888-1889 the metallurgy La Vieille Montagne was founded in Balen-Nete, close the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> and the canal to Beverlo. The company had {{its roots in the}} exploitation of the zinc mines of Moresnet.|$|E

50|$|The Belgian {{request is}} based on the treaty of 1839, and the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> Treaty of 1873. Critics felt that Belgium could not invoke these treaties, as the 1873 treaty granted Belgium a {{concession}} of 99 years on the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> route, a period which ended in 1972. Furthermore, Belgium had sold the railroad to the Dutch Government. The argument that carries most weight in the Netherlands is that the railroad runs through the nature reserve of De Meinweg, and nature activists fear the destruction of the local habitat of several threatened species, whereas Belgian interests consider this to be a delaying tactic while the Netherlands completes the Betuwe line.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> or Steel Rhine (IJzeren Rijn, Eiserner Rhein) is a {{partially}} nonoperational freight railway connecting {{the port of}} Antwerp (Belgium) and Mönchengladbach (Germany) by way of Neerpelt and the Dutch towns of Weert and Roermond.|$|E
50|$|Weert is {{a railway}} station in Weert, Netherlands. The station {{is on the}} Eindhoven-Weert railway, Weert-Roermond railway and the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> (Antwerp - Mönchengladbach). It was opened in 1879, the current {{building}} was built in 1913. The train services are operated by Nederlandse Spoorwegen.|$|E
50|$|The railroads {{connect the}} major cites of the province, such as Antwerp, Mechelen, Herentals, Turnhout and Mol. The <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> connects Antwerp with Mönchengladbach in Germany. The new High Speed Train connects Antwerpen-Centraal railway station with Brussels (HSL 4) and Amsterdam (HSL-Zuid) at high speed. Antwerp International Airport, located in Deurne is a {{regional}} airport.|$|E
50|$|Currently Belgium {{uses the}} , {{south of the}} <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine,</b> from Antwerp to Aachen via Aarschot, Hasselt, Tongeren and Montzen, for {{transportation}} of goods to Germany. High passenger traffic on parts of this route causes a lack of capacity for goods, {{and a number of}} steep inclines over the route make it problematic for long and heavy trains.|$|E

50|$|In freight transport, {{the line}} is {{currently}} used {{as an alternative to}} the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine.</b> Trains running from Belgium via the Montzen Railway to the Ruhr run on the Aachen-Mönchengladbach line from Aachen West station at least as far as Rheydt freight yard. They continue either via the Mönchengladbach freight rail bypass or via Mönchengladbach Hbf to Duisburg.|$|E
50|$|The {{province}} has {{a network}} of roads, railroads, canals and rivers which provide a modern infrastructure. Historically, the traffic infrastructure was {{an important element of}} connecting the Port of Antwerp with the Ruhr Area in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. Both the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> railroad and the E313 (King Baudouin highway) and E34 highway connect Antwerp with the Ruhr Area.|$|E
50|$|The hamlet {{is named}} after the railway station of Vlodrop, which was located on the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> {{connection}} between Antwerp and Germany. The location was chosen because the Belgian owners of the railway line could get free land there, {{and because of the}} proximity to the border meant that customs officers had extra powers. The station was bombed in 1944, and never rebuilt.|$|E
50|$|Although the 160.3 km <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> are {{not fully}} operational, 134.8 km of its tracks are in regular use. 85 km of the route is double tracked and 55 km is electrified. However, the 16.5 {{kilometers}} (Roermond-Dalheim) are not operational and a further 9 km (Budel-Weert) are used only rarely. 200 m meters of track in Dalheim, on the German side is fully overgrown.|$|E
50|$|Kolleg St. Ludwig is {{a campus}} located in Vlodrop, The Netherlands.

50|$|The Treaty of London {{between the}} Netherlands and Belgium in 1839 {{recognised}} {{the independence of}} Belgium. As part of the treaty, Belgium {{had the right to}} build a road or canal from Sittard to the Prussian border over Dutch territory, with Belgium funding the construction. This right was further established in the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> Treaty of 1873. At first, Belgium planned to dig a canal, but in the end it opted for a railway.|$|E
50|$|The Union Minière du Haut Katanga {{founded the}} Société Générale Métallurgique de Hoboken in Olen, which was {{established}} along the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> and the Albert Canal. The factory produced radium, cobalt and copper from the mines of the Union Minière in Katanga, Belgian Congo and Rhodesia. Along the canal Turnhout-Schoten the Métallurgique de la Campine was established in 1910 {{for the production of}} lead and antimony. In 1919 La Metallo-Chimique was established which specialized in the production of copper.|$|E
50|$|In 1868, {{construction}} of the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> started, and in 1879, the first trains used the railway. Initially, traffic was dense and frequent, but it decreased over time. Currently the railroad is used by some trains between Antwerp and the zinc factory in Budel, and between Budel and Weert. The line Weert - Roermond {{is part of the}} Dutch InterCity network, and is used daily by many trains. Between Roermond and the German border, traffic has fully ceased since 1991.|$|E

50|$|A long-distance inter-regional line (IR e) connects Neerpelt with Antwerp every hour. The trains {{start in}} Neerpelt, combine in Mol with a train {{partition}} from (or to) Hasselt, (or {{on the way}} back splits) and travels via Herentals and Lier to Antwerpen Centraal. In Herentals a branch line connects to the city of Turnhout, which is served by two lines of the SNCB; the InterCity R and the Interregio g. The latter, hourly train, uses the same route Herentals-Lier-Antwerp as the Interregio e (Antwerp-Lier-Herentals-Mol-Hasselt/Neerpelt). The InterCity R, which also travels hourly, however, leaves the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> in Lier, and reaches Brussels-Midi via Mechelen. The section Antwerp-Lier is also used by the Interregio c(Antwerp-Lier-Aarschot-Liege) and by local trains on the route Antwerp-Lier-Aarschot-Leuven. The service offering is reinforced along the trunk route of the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine,</b> with hourly local trains on the route Antwerp-Lier-Herentals-Mol serving smaller intermediate stations. In addition, the only during peak travel time circulating P-Train (Piekuurtrein / Train d'heure de pointe come) will also use the route.On weekends and holidays, the traffic is modest and the route will be run only by the IR e, the IR cand IR g at hourly intervals, whereas the IC-, P-, and L-trains do not run. Smaller stations will be serviced either by the IR gor not at all.|$|E

50|$|Arbitration {{has been}} used for centuries, {{including}} in antiquity, for the resolution of disputes between states and state-like entities. After a period of relative disuse, Jay's Treaty between the United States and Great Britain revived international arbitration as a means of resolving interstate disputes. The 1899 and 1907 Hague Conferences addressed arbitration as a mechanism for resolving state-to-state disputes, leading to the adoption of the Hague Conventions for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes. The Conventions established the Permanent Court of Arbitration and a rudimentary institutional framework for international arbitration of interstate disputes. In recent years, international arbitration {{has been used}} to resolve a number of disputes between states or state-like entities, including Eritrea v. Yemen, the Abyei Arbitration, the OSPAR Arbitration, and the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> Arbitration.|$|E
50|$|The Port of Antwerp is the {{economic}} {{heart of the}} province. Until the agricultural crisis of 1880, {{the eastern part of}} the province was a largely agricultural region. The industrial development of {{the eastern part of the}} province, part of the Campine region, started at the end of the 19th century when industry established itself in the region. The availability of cheap labor, new roads, canals, tramways and railroads such as the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine,</b> stimulated the settlement of new industry. Brick making industry alongside the canals, paper and printing business in Turnhout. Non-ferrous metallurgy in Balen-Nete, dynamite factories in Arendonk and Balen. Tobacco and cigar factories in Arendonk and the first shoe factory in Herentals. During the 1920s, the industrial expansion of the region continued with the radium and copper factories in Olen, the glass factory in Mol-Gompel and the diamond industry in Grobbendonk and Nijlen.|$|E
5000|$|Antwerp's {{potential}} {{was recognized}} by Napoleon Bonaparte and he ordered the construction of Antwerp's first lock and dock in 1811. Called the Bonaparte Dock, it was joined by a second dock - called the Willem Dock after the Dutch King - in 1813. When the Belgian revolution broke out in 1830, there was a well-founded fear that the Dutch would blockade the Scheldt again but, in the event, they contented themselves with levying a stiff toll. Fortunately, the young Belgium had friends in Britain {{and particularly in the}} person of Lord Palmerston, who believed the existence of Belgium would be beneficial to Britain, and that, in consequence, it was important {{to make sure that the}} newly born state was economically viable. With his support, the Belgian government was able to redeem the Dutch Toll in 1863. By that time, the Kattendijk Dock had been completed in 1860 and the all important <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> Railway to the Ruhr had been finished in 1879. Antwerp then experienced a second golden age and by 1908 eight docks had been constructed. The opening of the Royers Lock, commenced in 1905, meant that ships drawing up to 31 ft of water were able to enter the existing docks and access the new Lefèbvre and America docks.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{specific}} characteristics of decision-making in cross-border spatial projects and draws some lessons for European territorial cooperation. This {{is done by}} examining three major infrastructure projects between the Netherlands and Flanders: {{the construction of a}} high-speed rail link between Antwerp and Rotterdam, the deepening and widening of the Scheldt River, and the reopening of the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> freight railway between Antwerp and the German Ruhrgebiet (which cuts across Dutch territory). The analysis is structured into four issues that are often considered problematic for large spatial projects. First, a sound analysis of the actual problem that spatial projects are supposed to solve and a comparison of alternative courses of action are often lacking. Second, projects usually take longer than planned. Third, projects often encounter strong opposition. Fourth, impact research can be easily discredited in the decision-making process. The paper shows that cross-border projects encounter specific problems in all four areas, some of which could be ameliorated by more involvement by the European Union...|$|E
40|$|Legislation on the {{protection}} of biodiversity (e. g., European Union Habitat and Bird Directives) increasingly requires ecological impact assessment of human activities. However, {{knowledge and understanding of}} relevant ecological processes and species responses to different types of impact are often incomplete. In this paper we demonstrate with a case study how impact assessment can be carried out for situations where data are scarce but some expert knowledge is available. The case study involves two amphibian species, the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) and the natterjack toad (Bufo calamita) in the nature reserve the Meinweg in the Netherlands, for which plans are being developed to reopen an old railway track called the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine.</b> We assess the effects of this railway track and its proposed alternatives (scenarios) on the metapopulation extinction time and the occupancy times of the patches for both species using a discrete-time stochastic metapopulation model. We quantify the model parameters using expert knowledge and extrapolated data. Because of our uncertainty about these parameter values, we perform a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis. This yields an estimate of the probability distribution of the model predictions and insight into the contribution of each distinguished source of uncertainty to this probability distribution. We show that with a simple metapopulation model and an extensive uncertainty analysis it is possible to detect the least harmful scenario. The ranking of the different scenarios is consistent. Thus, uncertainty analysis can enhance the role of ecological impact assessment in decision making by making explicit to what extent incomplete knowledge affects predictions...|$|E
40|$|The study takes a {{comparative}} approach by investigating {{the situation in}} the hinterlands of two different port areas in Europe: Antwerp (Belgium) and Gdansk-Sopot-Gdynia agglomeration (Poland). Both port centres have an important road hinterland connection that faces competition from other alternative modes of freight transport. However, the Port of Antwerp is already one of the leading ports of the continent while the ports of Gdansk and Gdynia are at the stage of building their competitive position. Also the importance of inland waterways in the transport systems in these countries is different - Belgium has a functioning network of waterways while Poland still has to develop it. The Belgian case is the E 313 motorway, which makes the connection between Antwerp and Li 8 ge and further on also Germany. The motorway has competition from both rail and inland waterways, especially in dealing with port-bound traffic. The Albert Canal, which runs mainly in parallel with the motorway, is currently being subject to capacity expansion through the extension and elevation of a number bridges that cross the canal. Rail could specifically benefit from the potential re-activation of the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> - an almost parallel connection to the motorway E 313 between Antwerp and the German Ruhr area. The Polish case is focused on possible scenarios of freight traffic between Baltic port centre of Gdansk and Gdynia with important international harbour and fast developing regional centre - Bydgoszcz-Torun. At present the main connections between those urban areas are the state road 1, section of motorway A 1 and railway CE- 65. Gdansk, Torun and Bydgoszcz are also linked with Vistula river (part of international inland waterways E- 40 and E- 70) but so far it is not used extensively. The cases are analyzed separately. The added value of the paper is the comparative analysis which allows making conclusions that are valid for both environments. The results are of high relevance to policy makers in charge of alleviating port hinterland problems, and also to ports in the current highly competitive environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} project ORDERin’F (which is {{an acronym for}} ‘Organizing Rhizomic Development along a Regional pilot network in Flanders’) draws upon two basic questions as research hypothesis: 1 ° Is it possible to design a public transport network within the strongly fragmented spatial structure of Flanders that enhances significant long term economic, social and environmental benefits for the society at large ? 2 ° Can this regional network of public transport act as a lever to restructure the suburbanized spatial structure of Flanders in the long term? These questions arise from two ascertainments: the first one being that Flanders has a very dense network of railways, with good intercity connections, and holds a densely developed network of busses for local transport as well. However for trips at medium range distance, which we will call ‘regional’, there is no adequate public transport. Because of the suburbanization though, these ‘regional’ trips increasingly gain importance. In other countries, effective public transport systems {{have been developed to}} cover medium range distances. The second ascertainment is a sectoral disconnection between public transport and spatial planning policies in the Flemish context. Apart from station area redevelopments, the spatial structuring potential of public transport is not being capitalized because of this. Furthermore, the scientific rationale that integrates the domains of mobility, urbanism, spatial planning, human ecology and social economics into the conception of a new regional public transport system is lacking today. ORDERin’F aims to fill this knowledge gap by bringing together a multidisciplinary research team in one consortium. Instead of using regional public transport technologies to construct a new network on a basis of demand (following travel needs and known short term developments), it could be set up in a proactive way as an instrument to remodel the diffuse land use and nebular spatial pattern of Flanders. Although part off the research will be devoted to literature study and reference project analysis, the main focus will be on research by design, through the design of a regional public transport network in relation to the transformation of urbanization patterns in three sub-regions in Flanders. Each of these have a distinct macro-structure: -	The agglomeration around Leuven {{is an example of a}} classical centripetal structure around a city, although the vicinity of the airport as an international hub and the capital of Brussels are taken into account as well. -	The trajectory of the <b>Iron</b> <b>Rhine</b> Railway, which is part of a bundle of parallel infrastructures, forms the backbone of a linear sequence of interdependent towns. Together they form a corridor of peripheral urbanization. -	The region of Klein-Brabant lacks the centripetal or linear structure of the previous two cases. Instead it is a network of towns and ribbons that don’t have a clear hierarchy between them, located in the central void between the 3 biggest Flemish cities. The PhD dissertation will elaborate on the main challenge of the ORDERin’F {{research project}}: Can a diffuse urbanity and a regional public transport work together proactively, and if so, what are crucial factors? In dealing with this question, the dissertation will be of a contemplative and theoretical nature, tying together different aspects of the ORDERin’F project. Incorporating the in- and output of the other research partners involved (regarding mobility, health and sustainability issues, socio-economical aspects, …) as part of the framework thus becomes crucial. This will be attained by incorporation of the overall coordination of the project. Another challenge is finding a match between the theoretical nature of the PhD and the design-oriented approach of the overall research. The three sub-regions of Flanders are considered ‘laboratory set-ups’, in which the main hypothesis is tested and evaluated (through feedback loops with evaluation models assessing mobility and sustainability issues). Since there are no predetermined outcomes for these test cases, the conditions for a successful public transport network will emerge during the design process, thus defining the exact scope of the PhD. However, a number of crucial subthemes have already come forward during the early stages of the research: -	The unknown and untapped potential mutual benefits of connecting spatial and public transport planning in the Flemish context. -	The dilemma of using public transport to connect existing developments or as a catalyst for new developments. -	The difference between current car-based peripheral mobility patterns and the nature of public transport. Solving this mismatch will certainly have spatial retributions: in order to be efficient, regional public transport requires a bundling of origins and destinations. Creating such points of concentration is not in contradiction with the idea of a dispersed city, and could even help Flemish spatial planning ambitions of creating a “deconcentrated bundling”. -	The importance of intermodality to crosslink public transport lines as a prerequisite for an efficient service coverage. As a direct effect, the nodes within the network become crucial places, with a potential for attracting functions and services, redefining the meaning of small-scale station areas. -	Public transport as a means by which the apparent incompatibility between the diffuse city and sustainability is being tackled. -	Different modes of transport have different spatial characteristics. Tailor-made systems can adapt themselves to changing spatial conditions. The three regional designs and their resulting insights into the research questions will not only become the framework for the PhD dissertation; apart from that, they will form the bases for a report that offers policy recommendations to public partners. This means that the goals of the research is twofold: on the one hand, it is a scientific research resulting in an academic output in the form of PhD dissertations, while on the other hand aims to inform transport and spatial planning policy and practice. This duality in finality is a challenge, but also a strength: the relevance of the outcome is a mutually reinforcing combination of academic/scientific and societal interests. status: publishe...|$|E
