5|$|The bookwheel, in {{its most}} {{commonly}} seen form, was invented by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic <b>gearing</b> arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the <b>gearing</b> system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E
5|$|The {{disadvantages}} of the turbine were eventually overcome. The solution which eventually was generally adopted was the geared turbine, where <b>gearing</b> reduced the rotation {{rate of the}} propellers and hence increased efficiency. This solution required technical precision in the gears and hence was difficult to implement.|$|E
5|$|Work {{later in}} the year {{included}} the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail <b>gearing.</b> The brake and brake lever were made and installed and shutter cranks for the sails were cast.|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} a carrier-less, anti-backlash planetary <b>gear</b> {{system that has}} an input sun <b>gear,</b> a force-balancing and planet-alignment 'speeder' <b>gear</b> above the sun <b>gear,</b> a split ring <b>gear</b> that has a fixed lower ring <b>gear</b> coaxial with the sun <b>gear</b> and a rotating upper ring <b>gear</b> also coaxial with the sun <b>gear.</b> A preload bolt is used for securing the split ring <b>gears</b> together. Within the split ring <b>gear</b> is an even number of planet <b>gears</b> between the split ring <b>gear</b> and the sun <b>gear.</b> Each planet <b>gear</b> consists of an upper planet <b>gear,</b> and lower planet <b>gear</b> with {{the upper and lower}} planet <b>gears</b> splined together and pushed apart by a spring which causes separation and relative twist between the upper and lower planet <b>gears.</b> The lower planet <b>gear</b> meshes with the input sun <b>gear</b> and the fixed ring <b>gear</b> while the upper planet <b>gear</b> is driven by the lower planet <b>gear</b> and meshes with the rotating ring <b>gear...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{planetary}} <b>gear</b> system {{includes a}} sun <b>gear</b> coupled to an annular ring <b>gear</b> through {{a plurality of}} twist-planet <b>gears,</b> a speeder <b>gear,</b> and a ground structure having an internal ring <b>gear.</b> Each planet <b>gear</b> includes a solid <b>gear</b> having a first half portion {{in the form of}} a spur <b>gear</b> which includes vertical <b>gear</b> teeth and a second half portion {{in the form of a}} spur <b>gear</b> which includes helical <b>gear</b> teeth that are offset from the vertical <b>gear</b> teeth and which contact helical <b>gear</b> teeth on the speeder <b>gear</b> and helical <b>gear</b> teeth on the outer ring <b>gear.</b> One half of the twist planet <b>gears</b> are preloaded downward, while the other half are preloaded upwards, each one alternating with the other so that each one twists in a motion opposite to its neighbor when rotated until each planet <b>gear</b> seats against the sun <b>gear,</b> the outer ring <b>gear,</b> the speeder <b>gear,</b> and the inner ring <b>gear.</b> The resulting configuration is an improved stiff anti-backlash <b>gear</b> system...|$|R
30|$|Referring to Tables  7 and 8 for 50 and 150  hp engine, respectively, {{controllable}} {{factors can}} be ranked as <b>gear</b> 5, <b>gear</b> diff, <b>gear</b> 3, <b>gear</b> 2, <b>gear</b> 4, and <b>gear</b> 1 for 50 hp engine and <b>gear</b> 5, <b>gear</b> diff, <b>gear</b> 3, <b>gear</b> 1, <b>gear</b> 4, and <b>gear</b> 2 for 150  hp engine. The most significant factors affecting the fuel consumption are <b>gear</b> 5, the second ranking factor is differential <b>gear</b> {{and a third}} ranking factor is <b>gear</b> 3. According to the F value, the remaining factors, <b>gear</b> 1, 2 and 4 are not significant. They are sensitive a little for an engine with a low engine power.|$|R
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1973, Sihanouk loyalists {{had been}} purged from all of GRUNK's {{ministries}} {{and all of the}} prince's supporters within the insurgent ranks were also eliminated. Shortly after Christmas, as the insurgents were <b>gearing</b> up for their final offensive, Sihanouk spoke with the French diplomat Etienne Manac'h. He said that his hopes for a moderate socialism akin to Yugoslavia's must now be totally dismissed. Stalinist Albania, he said, would be the model.|$|E
5|$|The {{caissons}} {{are required}} to turn with the wheel {{in order to remain}} level. Whilst the weight of the caissons on the bearings is generally sufficient to rotate them, a <b>gearing</b> mechanism using three large identically sized gears connected by two smaller ones ensures that they turn at precisely the correct speed and remain correctly balanced.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Comet's {{avionics}} {{systems were}} new to civil aviation. One such feature was irreversible powered flight controls, which increased the pilot's ease {{of control and}} the safety of the aircraft by preventing aerodynamic forces from changing the directed positions and placement of the aircraft's control surfaces. Additionally, a large number of the control surfaces, such as the elevators, were equipped with a complex <b>gearing</b> system as a safeguard against accidentally over-stressing the surfaces or airframe at higher speed ranges.|$|E
50|$|The input <b>gear</b> in this <b>gear</b> train has 13 {{teeth and}} the idler <b>gear</b> has 21 teeth. Considering only these <b>gears,</b> the <b>gear</b> ratio between the idler and the input <b>gear</b> can be {{calculated}} as if the idler <b>gear</b> was the output <b>gear.</b> Therefore, the <b>gear</b> ratio is driven/drive = 21/13 ≈1.62 or 1.62:1.|$|R
50|$|An {{epicyclic}} <b>gear</b> train {{consists of}} two <b>gears</b> mounted so that the center of one <b>gear</b> revolves around {{the center of the}} other. A carrier connects the centers of the two <b>gears</b> and rotates to carry one <b>gear,</b> called the planet <b>gear,</b> around the other, called the sun <b>gear.</b> The planet and sun <b>gears</b> mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. A point on the pitch circle of the planet <b>gear</b> traces an epicycloid curve. In this simplified case, the sun <b>gear</b> is fixed and the planetary <b>gear(s)</b> roll around the sun <b>gear.</b>|$|R
50|$|If {{a simple}} <b>gear</b> train has three <b>gears,</b> {{such that the}} input <b>gear</b> GA meshes with an {{intermediate}} <b>gear</b> GI which in turn meshes with the output <b>gear</b> GB, then the pitch circle of the intermediate <b>gear</b> rolls without slipping on both the pitch circles of the input and output <b>gears.</b> This yields the two relationsThe speed ratio of this <b>gear</b> train is obtained by multiplying these two equations to obtainNotice that this <b>gear</b> ratio {{is exactly the same}} as for the case when the <b>gears</b> GA and GB engage directly. The intermediate <b>gear</b> provides spacing but does not affect the <b>gear</b> ratio. For this reason it is called an idler <b>gear.</b> The same <b>gear</b> ratio is obtained for a sequence of idler <b>gears</b> and hence an idler <b>gear</b> is used to provide the same direction to rotate the driver and driven <b>gear.</b> If the driver <b>gear</b> moves in the clockwise direction, then the driven <b>gear</b> also moves in the clockwise direction {{with the help of the}} idler <b>gear.</b>|$|R
5|$|The first geared {{clock was}} invented in the 11th century by the Arab {{engineer}} Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic <b>gearing,</b> capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex <b>gearing,</b> until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism {{may have played a}} role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism, which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.|$|E
5|$|The {{turbines}} {{were designed}} to operate at 12,500 rpm and were paired with a generator set with a 10:1 reduction <b>gearing.</b> A twin-armature DC generator was used to power the traction motors, while a three-phase, 220-volt AC generator provided auxiliary functions such as powering the traction motor blowers and providing head-end power; the latter, which was used to provide lighting, heating, and air conditioning to passenger cars, was incredibly unusual in 1939 and would not become standard until the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|To avoid violating Edison's patents, Biograph cameras from 1895 to 1902 used a large-format film {{measuring}} 2-23/32 inches (68mm) wide, with {{an image}} area of 2 × 2½ inches, four times that of Edison's 35mm format. Biograph film was not ready-perforated; the camera itself punched a sprocket hole {{on each side of}} the frame as the film was exposed at 30 frames per second. Sherlock Holmes Baffled ran to 86.56 metres in length, giving the film a running time of 30 seconds (although in practice, due to the hand-cranked <b>gearing</b> of the Mutoscope this would have varied).|$|E
25|$|Epicyclic <b>gears</b> {{are also}} called {{planetary}} <b>gears</b> because the axes {{of the planet}} <b>gears</b> revolve around the common axis {{of the sun and}} ring <b>gears</b> that they mesh with and roll between. In the image, the yellow shaft carries the sun <b>gear</b> which is almost hidden. The blue <b>gears</b> are called planet <b>gears</b> and the pink <b>gear</b> is the ring <b>gear</b> or annulus.|$|R
2500|$|In {{discussing}} the spur <b>gear</b> differential, {{the use of}} the term annular <b>gear</b> is a convenient way to distinguish the sun <b>gears</b> of the two epicyclic <b>gear</b> trains.

5|$|In {{a series}} of campaigns he {{recovered}} the provinces of Jazira, Thughur and Jibal, and effected a rapprochement with the Saffarids {{in the east and}} the Tulunids in the west that secured their—albeit largely nominal—recognition of caliphal suzerainty. These successes came at the cost of <b>gearing</b> the economy almost exclusively towards maintenance of the army, which resulted in the expansion and rise to power of the central fiscal bureaucracy and contributed to the Caliph's lasting reputation for avarice. Al-Mu'tadid was also renowned for his cruelty when punishing criminals, and subsequent chroniclers record his extensive and ingenious use of torture. His reign also saw the permanent move of the capital back to Baghdad, where he engaged in major building activities. A firm supporter of Sunni traditionalist orthodoxy, he nevertheless maintained good relations with the Alids, and was interested in natural sciences, renewing caliphal sponsorship of scholars and scientists.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Aguilera <b>gearing</b> up and riding a {{motorcycle}} into a nightclub. Wearing a bikini and buttocks-bearing chaps, she is lowered from a cage into a boxing ring and dances, accompanied by several back-up dancers. A masked woman is {{lowered into the}} ring, and the two engage in foxy boxing. The scene is intercut with sequences of Aguilera dancing in a crop top, which she later removes to reveal a bra, and a microskirt. Redman then proceeds down a hallway, passing people such as mud wrestlers, a contortionist, and furries. The video proceeds to a scene of Aguilera and back-up dancers splashing and dancing while being sprayed with water in a room containing several urinals, as a possible reference to urolagnia. It features several sexual fetishes, from mud wrestling to muscle worshipping.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and <b>gearing.</b>|$|E

40|$|A <b>gear</b> bearing {{having a}} first <b>gear</b> {{and a second}} <b>gear,</b> each having a {{plurality}} of teeth.

5|$|In February 1975, {{during the}} midst of Tet New Year celebrations, a North Vietnamese deserter {{surrendered}} himself to the ARVN 2nd Brigade Headquarters. Through extensive interrogations, the North Vietnamese soldier revealed the whereabouts of North Vietnamese units; the 10th Infantry Division had encircled Duc Lap, while the 320A Infantry Division had arrived in Ea H’leo and were <b>gearing</b> up for an assault on Thuan Man, and an unknown unit was heading towards Ban Me Thuot. In late February, North Vietnamese artillery shells began to rain down on Pleiku, which convinced General Phu that the North Vietnamese would attack Pleiku instead of Ban Me Thuot. South Vietnamese military intelligence and information received from the American Embassy in Saigon showed the presence of {{about two or three}} North Vietnamese combat divisions positioned about 20kilometres away from Kontum and Pleiku. Indeed, the movements around Pleiku and Kontum during the month of February were designed by the North Vietnamese Tay Nguyen Front to fool South Vietnamese military commanders in the Central Highlands.|$|E
5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} Winston Cup Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson felt comfortable, located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against {{it because of the}} rules regarding restrictor plate racing. Robinson failed to qualify for the first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end <b>gearing</b> became detached causing her to collide with the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that she used the season as motivation; she hoped to be driving consistently in five years, and wanted to be a spokesperson for women.|$|E
5|$|The event's tenth stage {{featured}} a summit finish to Monte Terminillo. The general classification contenders {{were all in}} a group together {{as they reached the}} final climb of the day. Piotr Ugrumov {{was the first of the}} group to attack and was joined by Roberto Conti shortly after. Behind, Indurain led a chase group that contained Andrew Hampsten, Chiappucci, Giovannetti, and Luis Herrera, while general classification hopefuls Chioccioli and Fignon dropped off the back since they could not keep pace. The group caught Conti, who was alone after Ugrumov slowed, and from there, Herrera attacked to win the stage. The next day's route was an undulating one. Chioccioli, Roberto Pagnin, and Marco Lietti formed a breakaway group and gained an advantage of three and a half minutes over the main field which was led by Indurain's team, Banesto. The group remained in front, Pagnin took the stage victory, and Indurain finished over two minutes later. With around nine kilometers remaining in the twelfth stage, there was an accident that saw Chiappicci and Giovannetti amongst others go down. The peloton continued on, <b>gearing</b> up for a sprint finish that Leoni won.|$|E
5000|$|A crown <b>gear</b> (or a contrate <b>gear)</b> is a <b>gear</b> {{which has}} teeth that project {{at right angles}} to the face of the wheel. In particular, a crown <b>gear</b> isa type of bevel <b>gear</b> where the pitch cone angle is 90 degrees.

40|$|Epicyclic <b>gear</b> {{transmissions}} which transmit output at a <b>gear</b> ratio dependent only {{upon the}} input's direction are considered. A transmission housing envelops two epicyclic <b>gear</b> assemblies, and has shafts extending from it. One shaft {{is attached to}} a sun <b>gear</b> within the first epicyclic <b>gear</b> assembly. Planet <b>gears</b> are held symmetrically about the sun <b>gear</b> by a planet <b>gear</b> carrier and are in mesh with both the sun <b>gear</b> and a ring <b>gear.</b> Two unidirectional clutches restrict rotation of the first planet <b>gear</b> carrier and ring <b>gear</b> to one direction. A connecting shaft drives a second sun <b>gear</b> at the same speed and direction as the first planet <b>gear</b> carrier while a connecting portion drives a second planet <b>gear</b> carrier at the same speed and direction as the first ring <b>gear.</b> The transmission's output is then transmitted by the second ring <b>gear</b> to the second shaft. Input is transmitted at a higher <b>gear</b> ratio and lower speed for all inputs in the first direction than in the opposite direction...|$|R
30|$|<b>Gear</b> mesh {{stiffness}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} internal excitations of <b>gear</b> dynamics. With the growth of <b>gear</b> tooth pitting, <b>gear</b> mesh stiffness shape changes and consequently dynamic properties of <b>gear</b> systems change. Therefore, accurate <b>gear</b> mesh stiffness evaluation is a prerequisite of <b>gear</b> dynamics analysis.|$|R
5|$|The fantail and {{associated}} <b>gearing</b> was fitted to the mill. At {{the end of}} the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by ½ inch (13mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at {{the end of the}} second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in.|$|E
25|$|Compact <b>gearing</b> is not {{necessarily}} lower than standard <b>gearing</b> if cassettes with smaller sprockets (such as 11–23) are used. A high gear of 50×11 on a compact drivechain is actually slightly higher than the 53×12 of a standard set.|$|E
25|$|The <b>gearing</b> {{provided}} some additional technical problems. Smith geared the engines to the propeller via spur-wheels and pinions, {{the largest of}} which was toothed with hornbeam (a white timber traditionally used for <b>gearing</b> in windmills). The <b>gearing</b> arrangement proved to be very noisy, and the ship's stern was subject to considerable vibration in operation. Smith planned to reduce the noise {{by the use of}} spiral gears, but it is unclear whether this modification was ever carried out.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Gear</b> Master was an {{accessory}} for the Sega Game <b>Gear</b> handheld game console.

50|$|The third <b>gear</b> in {{the picture}} has 42 teeth. The <b>gear</b> ratio between the idler and third <b>gear</b> is thus 42/21, or 2:1, and hence the final <b>gear</b> ratio is 1.62x2≈3.23. For every 3.23 {{revolutions}} of the smallest <b>gear,</b> the largest <b>gear</b> turns one revolution, or for every one revolution of the smallest <b>gear,</b> the largest <b>gear</b> turns 0.31 (1/3.23) revolution, a total reduction of about 1:3.23 (<b>Gear</b> Reduction Ratio (GRR) = 1/Gear Ratio (GR)).|$|R
2500|$|A <b>gear</b> {{train is}} formed by {{mounting}} <b>gears</b> on a frame {{so that the}} teeth of the <b>gears</b> engage.
