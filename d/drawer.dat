After a misunderstanding between Craig and the thickly accented Anya, Malcolm takes the bill, {{but he and}} Archie both wish to pay. Craig insists that he will pay, as he is leaving, and wealthier than the others. The three argue, with Archie unable to pay as the card machine lacks paper. Malcolm suggests that the bill should be split three ways, with the northerners treating Craig, but Kevin {{claims to be the}} poorest. Archie, Malcolm and Craig thrust cards at Anya until Kevin offers to pay. He counts cash as Anya fetches drinks. Craig thanks the others for making his trip bearable, and offers to pay, restarting the argument. This becomes about Malcolm's position as badminton-club secretary, with Malcolm revealing that Archie has spent time in prison. Anya arrives with drinks, and Craig, paying the bill, speaks of craving excitement, only to have his card declined. He phones his au pair for a card, keen she not look in the wrong <b>drawer,</b> but Malcolm snatches the phone. He is about to pay, but Archie stops him.

5|$|On 24 January 2000, {{the part}} of the {{radiation}} therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source <b>drawer.</b> Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in Phra Pradaeng District, Samut Prakan Province. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an oxyacetylene torch. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.|$|E
50|$|Open <b>Drawers.</b> -- Girls {{generally}} {{begin to}} wear open <b>drawers</b> {{when they are}} about nine or ten years old. Open <b>drawers</b> are not cut down at the hips, and the band is made all in one piece of the material.

The fronts, in children's sizes, are seamed together for about 2 inches, in women's sizes a little more. A button and buttonhole are placed {{at the ends of}} the bands, or two tape strings. The legs may be constructed as for closed <b>drawers,</b> i.e. as knickerbockers with bands, or they may be made up with a deep hem, and narrow tucks above. The <b>drawers</b> are gathered or pleated into the bands at the waist and legs. Women's <b>drawers</b> are very seldom made up as closed, but nearly always as open.|$|R
50|$|Early {{versions}} of Mac OS X's Aqua UI supported a sidebar concept called, <b>drawers,</b> which draw {{out of the}} application window rather than expand from the inside like most application sidebars, are used. Despite criticism, third-party applications like Transmit, OmniWeb, Shiira and BBEdit quickly adopted <b>drawers.</b> The standard email client, Mail, used <b>drawers</b> for listing mailboxes prior to 10.4 ("Tiger"), when they were replaced by a traditional sidebar. A number of other Apple-created applications and third-party applications have replaced <b>drawers</b> with a sidebar, or re-designed the interface to make a sidebar/drawer unnecessary. Apple's Human Interface Guidelines now recommend against their use. Formerly drawer-heavy apps, like iCal and Adium, now contain no <b>drawers</b> at all, and instead display an optional sidebar within the main window.|$|R

5|$|At Marsh's urging, Powell {{pushed for}} Cope to return {{specimens}} he had unearthed during his employment under the government surveys. This was an outrage to Cope, {{who had used}} his own money {{while working as a}} volunteer. In response, Cope went to the editor of the New York Herald and promised a scandalous headline. Since 1885, Cope had kept an elaborate journal of mistakes and misdeeds that both Marsh and Powell had committed over the years. From scientific errors to publishing mistakes, he had them written down in a journal he kept in the bottom <b>drawer</b> of his Pine Street desk. Cope sought out Marsh's assistants, who complained of being denied access and credit by their employer and of being chronically underpaid. Reporter William Hosea Ballou ran the first article on January 12, 1890, in what would become a series of newspaper debates between Marsh, Powell, and Cope. Cope attacked Marsh for plagiarism and financial mismanagement, and attacked Powell for his geological classification errors and misspending of government-allocated funds. Marsh and Powell published their own side of the story and, in the end, little changed. No congressional hearing was created to investigate Powell's alleged misallocation of funds, while Cope and Marsh were not held responsible for any mistakes. Indirectly, however, the attacks may have been influential in Marsh's fall from power in the survey. Due to pressure from Powell over bad press, Marsh was removed from his position for the government surveys. Cope's relations {{with the president of the}} University of Pennsylvania soured, and the entire funding for paleontology in the government surveys was pulled.|$|E
