50|$|In the {{earliest}} applications power was transmitted between pulleys using loops of rope on grooved pulleys. This method is extremely rare today, dating {{mostly from the}} 18th century. Flat belts on flat pulleys or drums were the most common method during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The belts were generally tanned leather or cotton duck <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> <b>rubber.</b> Leather belts were fastened in loops with rawhide or wire lacing, lap joints and glue, or one of several types of steel fasteners. Cotton duck belts usually used metal fasteners or were melted together with heat. The leather belts were run with the hair side against the pulleys for best traction. The belts needed periodic cleaning and conditioning {{to keep them in}} good condition. Belts were often twisted 180 degrees per leg and reversed on the receiving pulley to cause the second shaft to rotate in the opposite direction.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sepaktakraw is a {{traditional}} game played at international level in Asia. The game is played by using {{various parts of the}} body except the hands. Most notably the head is very often used. But unlike soccer, no study has been done on injuries caused by contact between the ball and the head. The balls are typically made of plastic. Recently new balls made of plastic <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> <b>rubber</b> was introduced. In this study a method has been developed to measure the Head Impact Power of Sepaktakraw balls. Using this method it was found that two different balls results in entirely two different outcomes. It was found that the balls made of plastic <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> <b>rubber</b> has 4 times more probability of causing mild brain traumatic injury when dropped from a height of 3. 5 m. The significance of this study is the importance of taking into consideration the safety of an athlete when designing sports equipment even as simple as a plastic ball...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{the game}} of sepaktakraw the players often use the head to control the ball at high speeds. Recently {{a new type of}} ball was {{introduced}} which is still made of plastic but <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> <b>rubber.</b> The reason for this is to reduce the impact of the ball on the head. However {{it was found that the}} new ball was actually causing more headaches to players. Preliminary study found that the new ball travels at higher speeds than the older plain plastic balls. From CFD studies, it was found that the new ball travels at a higher speed because of its smaller diameter. In addition the new ball generates negative lift which will cause the ball to descent at a steeper angle. The effect of the rubber is only to slightly increase the drag forces and slightly reduce the lift...|$|E

We compared the rates of catheter colonization and catheter-related bloodstream infection associated with these two kinds of antiinfective catheters. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, randomized clinical trial in 12 university-affiliated hospitals. High-risk adult patients in whom central venous catheters were expected to remain in place for three or more days were randomly assigned to undergo insertion of polyurethane, triple-lumen catheters <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> either minocycline and rifampin (on both the luminal and external surfaces) or chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (on only the external surface). After their removal, the tips and subcutaneous segments of the catheters were cultured by both the roll-plate and the sonication methods. Peripheral-blood cultures were obtained if clinically indicated. RESULTS: Of 865 catheters inserted, 738 (85 percent) produced culture results that could be evaluated. The clinical characteristics of the patients and the risk factors for infection were similar in the two groups.

The CGSs <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> NSS became infected and degraded, whereas the CGSs <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> 7 or 14 µg/cm(2) bFGF displayed accelerated dermis-like tissue formation and the CGSs <b>impregnated</b> <b>with</b> 14 µg/cm(2) bFGF produced significant improvements in the remaining wound area, neoepithelium length and numbers and total area of newly formed capillaries compared with the NSS group.
