5|$|This metric {{contains}} a scale factor, which {{describes how the}} size of the universe changes with time. This enables a convenient choice of a coordinate system to be made, called comoving coordinates. In this coordinate system, the grid <b>expands</b> along with the universe, and objects that are moving only because of the expansion of the universe, remain at fixed points on the grid. While their coordinate distance (comoving distance) remains constant, the physical distance between two such co-moving points <b>expands</b> proportionally with the scale factor of the universe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influence}} of the types and addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> agent and the age of cement on expansion value and expansion performance of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> agent was systematically studied. The expansion characteristics of cement based material added with MgO <b>expanding</b> agent or calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> agent were compared. The expansion of such material increases with the addition dose of MgO <b>expanding</b> agent and cement mortar age. During the test period, the expansion of cement based material increases continuously. The light-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent modified by CaO <b>expanding</b> agent is able to increase the 28 d expansion of such material effectively. The temperature of calcination for the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent is higher than that of light-burned one, thus the heavy-burned MgO <b>expanding</b> agent has a rather dense structure with slow hydration rate and gives a small expansion of the cement based material at early age, showing an obvious expansion delay. The calcium sulphoaluminate <b>expanding</b> agent gives most expansion of the material in the early 28 d and there is small expansion at middle and later age of the material...|$|R

Leaf sheaths contained significantly more nonstructural carbohydrate than did the <b>expanded</b> blade.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A mixture of powdered or liquid metal and powdered or liquid metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is treated with a liquid or gaseous non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material. The non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is added to the metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material to form the <b>expanding</b> agent. Preferred Features: The non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is a hydrating agent and the <b>expanding</b> agent is a metal hydride. The hydrating agent is hydrogen gas or a gas mixture containing hydrogen. The reaction of the non metal-containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material with the metal -containing <b>expanding</b> agent intermediate material is carried out at 300 - 700, preferably 400 - 600 deg.
