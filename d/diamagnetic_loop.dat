Since it is this parameter which is required for the reconstruction, it is evident that the DML is the ideal diagnostic for this technique. The simplest application of this technique requires at least three shots for a reconstruction but in reality requires averaging over many more shots because of shot to shot variation.

40|$|A {{deliberate}} stochastization of {{the magnetic}} field in tokamaks with Ergodic Divertors (ED) modifies essentially the transport properties at the plasma edge by permitting a radial transfer of particles and heat along stochastic field lines and affecting anomalous transport perpendicular to them. A model for the effective transport coefficients in a stochastic magnetic field, taking into account both parallel flows and perpendicular transfer of anomalous nature, has been incorporated into the 1. 5 D transport code RITM for self-consistent calculations of the radial profiles of plasma parameters. Computations have been performed for the tokamak TEXTOR to simulate phases in an ohmic shot without and with the Dynamic Ergodic Divertor (DED). Results show that the increase of the outward convective transport in the stochastic boundary layer leads to a drop of the line average density.

40|$|High-density {{operation}} is {{beneficial to the}} plasma confinement and fusion reaction rate. However, in high-density plasmas, standard microwave heating is hampered by the cutoff layer that prevents propagation to the resonance. The electrostatic Electron Bernstein Wave (EBW) undergoes no cutoff and hence allows extension of the operation domain to higher densities [1]. On the other hand, EBW cannot propagate in vacuum and thus must be excited by mode conversion of an externally launched electromagnetic wave. Experiments on TCV demonstrated EBW Heating (EBWH) via a double mode-conversion process from ordinary (O) mode, to extraordinary (X) mode and finally to B-mode in a standard aspect-ratio tokamak {{for the first time}} [2].

A lowered recycling rate is expected to flatten core Te profiles, raise edge Te, strongly affect ne profiles, and enhance confinement. To study these unique plasmas, a Thomson scattering diagnostic uses a ≤ 20 J, 30 ns FWHM pulsed ruby laser to measure Te and ne at 11 radial points on the horizontal midplane, spaced from the magnetic axis to the outer edge at a single temporal point for each discharge. Scattered light is imaged through a spectrometer onto an intensified CCD. The diagnostic is absolutely calibrated using a precision light source and Raman scattering. Measurements of ne are compared with line integrated density measurements from a microwave interferometer. Adequate signal to noise is obtained with ne ≥ 2 × 1018 m− 3.

40|$|Some {{features}} of neutron emission from dense plasma focus {{suggest that the}} participating deuterons have energy {{in the range of}} 105 eV and have a directionality of toroidal motion. Theoretical models of these devices assume that the plasma evolves through a purely irrotational flow and thus fail to predict such solenoidal flow on the scale of the plasma dimensions. Predictions of a relaxation theory are consistent with experimental data [S K H Auluck, Physics of Plasmas, 18, 032508 (2011) ], but the assumptions upon which it is based are not compatible with known {{features of}} these devices. There is thus no satisfactory theoretical construct which provides the necessity for solenoidal flow in these devices. This paper proposes such theoretical construct, namely, the principle of constrained dynamics, and describes an experiment which provides support for this idea. The experiment consisted of low inductance, self-breaking spark discharge in helium at a pressure ~ 100 hPa between two pointed electrodes separated by 30 - 50 mm distance kept inside a vacuum chamber mounted on a low inductance high voltage capacitor. The current derivative signal showed reproducible sharp dips at all the extrema of the damped sinusoidal discharge.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} was to gain {{an understanding}} on {{the relative importance of}} microwave power, neutral pressure, and magnetic field configuration on the behavior of the hot electrons within an Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Source (ECRIS) plasma. This was carried out through measurement of plasma bremsstrahlung with both NaI(Tl) (hv > 30 keV) and CdTe (2 keV 150 W on a 6. 4 GHz ECRIS) was accompanied by a large increase in total x-ray power. We suggest that the saturation of x-ray power and plasma energy density was due to rf-induced pitch-angle scattering of the electrons. X-ray power and plasma energy density were also shown to saturate with neutral pressure, and to increase nearly linearly as the gradient of the magnetic field in the resonance zone was decreased. All of these findings were in agreement with the theoretical models describing ECRIS plasmas. We have discussed the use of a <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>loop</b> as a means of exploring various plasma time scales on a relative basis. Specifically, we focused much of our attention on studying how changing ion source parameters, such as microwave power and neutral pressure, would effect the rise and decay of the integrated diamagnetic signal, which can be related to plasma energy density. We showed that increasing microwave power lowers the e-fold times at both the leading edge and the trailing edge of the microwave pulse. Microwave power, however, had almost no impact on the ignition times of the plasma. The plasma energy density e-fold times were insensitive to both neutral pressure and magnetic field setting. Neutral pressure, however, had a dramatic effect on the time of first appearance of the diamagnetic signal ("plasma ignition time"). In addition to neutral pressure, ignition times were also a function the relative abundance of electrons in the plasma chamber {{at the beginning of a}} microwave pulse. In all instances, the rise time of the integrated diamagnetic signal was seen to be faster than the decay time. By comparing the unintegrated diamagnetic signal to the ratio of reflected to forward microwave power we theorized that the initial, exponential rise in the diamagnetic signal at the leading edge of a microwave pulse was due to rapid changes in both the average electron energy and density. During the slowly decaying portion of the <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>loop</b> signal, only the hot tail of the electron population was increasing. This theory was supported by time resolved, low energy x-ray measurements that showed that the period of rapid change of the ratio of reflected to forward microwave power coincided with a rapid change in average photon energy. We have also showed that x-rays production in an ECRIS plasma was highly anisotropic, with radial x-ray counts being much greater than axial x-ray counts. This was shown to be true for both the "ECR" (operating at 6. 4 GHz) and the higher performance "AECR-U" (operating at 14 GHz). Based on this, we can make the qualitative statement that the electron energy was also highly anisotropic, with a much larger perpendicular energy than parallel energy. The degree of anisotropy was shown to increase with the operating frequency of the ion source. This increase was most likely attributable to the higher power density and greater confinement associated with higher performance machines, and implies that superconducting ECRIS operating at very high frequencies will have extremely anisotropic x-ray power deposition. The radial spectral temperature on the "AECR-U" was over twice as large as the axial spectral temperature. However, in the "ECR" the radial and axial spectral temperatures were similar. Hence, the anisotropy in spectral temperature also showed dependence on the magnetic field strength and operating frequency of the ECRIS. The combination of higher energies, and intensity of high energy x-rays in the radial direction has important implications in the x-ray heat load estimates for superconducting ECR ion source cryostats...|$|E

Pin diode array has been widely used to reconstruct plasma image with tomography technique for MHD study in most tokamaks. Direct measurement of x-ray image from tangential view by using the micro-channel plate(MCP) detector coupled to video camera has been done in tokamaks in order to measure internal shape of the magnetic flux surfaces and to estimate a current density profile. Two-dimensional hard x-ray image was also measured with a hard x-ray camera to study the distribution of suprathermal electrons during lower hybrid heating in PBX-M tokamak. However, there is no energy resolution in these diagnostics. The energy range measured can be selected only by arranging the Be or AI filter in front of the detector. As a conventional measurement of x-ray with good energy resolution, the pulse height analysis (PHA) has been well developed to measure electron temperature and the concentration of high-Z impurity from the x-ray energy spectra. However, PHA system has {{a relatively small number of}} spatial channel and accordingly poor spatial resolution. 　　The soft x-ray CCD camera has been widely used in astronomy as an instrument of x-ray imaging because of its good energy and spatial resolution. Recently, the photon counting x-ray CCD camera was applied to inertial confinement fusion (ICF) plasma. However, there is no application of this CCD camera to magnetically confined fusion plasma, because the frame rate has been considered to be too slow to measure x-ray from the short pulse discharge. Recent experiments in the Large Helical Device (LHD) demonstrate the discharge can be sustained for more than a minute, which encourages us to apply the soft x-ray CCD to the measurement of two-dimensional profile of electron velocity distribution as well as a shape of the magnetic flux surface. 　　In general, there are two different operation modes in the soft x-ray CCD camera, imaging mode and photon counting mode, depending on the magnitude of photon flux. When the flux of soft x-ray is low enough to the level of one photon per pixel per frame (photon counting mode), an amount of charge in each pixel of CCD created by the individual x-ray photon is proportional to the energy of x-ray. Therefore, the x-ray energy spectra can be obtained by counting the number of photons at given intensity (photon counting mode). When the soft x-ray flux is much higher than the level of photon counting mode, the intensity of each pixel is proportional to the total emission of x-ray (imaging mode). Since the total emission of x-ray is considered to be constant on magnetic flux surface, the shape of magnetic flux can be reconstructed from the soft x-ray image. The magnetic axis moves outward due to the vertical field created by the asymmetric toroidal current (Pfirsch-Schluter current) produced by the plasma pressure gradient in a finite-beta toroidal plasma, which is well known as a Shafranov shift. 　　The measurement of Shafranov shift due to the Pfirsch-Schluter currents is important to study equilibrium beta-limit on plasma confinement. The tangential soft x-ray image has been measured by using the soft x-ray CCD camera in the imaging mode with good spatial resolution in the Compact Helical System (CHS). The Shafranov shift of the plasma magnetic axis is derived from the best fit of the intensity contour of soft x-ray emission calculated by using equilibrium code with various pressure profiles to that measured with soft x-ray CCD camera. It is found that the measured Shafranov shifts are larger than those expected from diamagnetic measurements at low-density plasma with tangential NBI, because of a significant fraction of beam pressure parallel to magnetic field. The Shafranov shift (ΔCCD) measured with CCD camera corresponds to the total pressure p including thermal pressure, and parallel (pb//) and perpendicular (pb⊥) beam pressures. The Shafranov shift can be derived from the stored energy measured with <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>loop.</b> However, isotropic pressure profile (i. e. pb// = pb⊥) should be assumed to calculate the Shafranov shift from the stored energy, because the <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>loop</b> detects only the perpendicular pressure. Therefore, anisotropy of plasma pressure can be evaluated from the difference in Shafranov shift measured with CCD camera and that estimated from <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>loop.</b> The pressure anisotropy is found to increase as the electron density is decreased from 4 × 1019 m- 3 to 0. 5 × 1019 m- 3 in the NBI heated plasma. The large anisotropy is consistent with the fact that energy confinement time (〜 1 ms) is much shorter than the slowing down time (〜 0. 1 s) of neutral beam at low electron density plasma in CHS. Therefore, the pressure anisotropy disappears in ECH plasma even at the low electron density (ne 〜 0. 5 × 1019 m- 3) or high density NBI plasma (ne 〜 4. 0 × 1019 m- 3). On the other hand, there is no anisotropy observed in LHD plasma, where the energy confinement time is comparable to the beam slowing down time of neutral beam. 　　When the soft x-ray CCD camera is operated with photon counting mode, the full image area of CCD detector is divided to 512 zones (32 x 16), which gives two-dimensional spatial channels. One energy spectrum corresponding to one spatial channel is derived by counting the number of photons in one zone (32 x 32 pixels). The energy calibration of soft x-ray CCD detector has been done with Fe K-alpha and K-beta lines from iron target soft x-ray source. The energy resolution of each pixel is calibrated to be 16 eV/ADC count, and the instrumental width, full width of half maximum (FWHM), is 0. 21 keV at 6. 4 keV. It is very important to optimize the level of x-ray flux good for photon counting mode, since the number of pixels in one zone (32 x 32 pixels) is only 1024 and the number of photons acceptable is limited. The number of x-ray photon should be adjusted just below the critical photon number for "pile-up". The ratio of photon number to pixel number (η≡Nphoton/Npixel) should be below 1 / √N pixel to avoid "pile-up". Since the one zone consists to 1024 pixels in our measurements, the critical η for the pile-up is 0. 03. In our experiment, the energy spectra measured with CCD camera agree with those estimated from electron temperature and density profiles measured with YAG Thomson scattering, when the ratio η is below the critical value (0. 03). Two-dimensional energy spectra of x-ray emission have been measured by using x-ray CCD camera with photon counting mode in CHS. The energy spectrum measured with CCD camera agrees with that estimated from electron temperature and density profiles measured with YAG Thomson scattering in the energy region of 2 〜 8 keV. The two-dimensional electron temperature profiles (32 x 16 channels) are derived from the slopes of x-ray continuum with 512 spatial channels (32 x 16). 　　The two-dimensional intensity profiles of titanium (Ti), chromium (Cr) and iron (Fe) K-alpha lines have been measured with x-ray CCD camera as well as the two-dimensional electron temperature when the electron temperature is high enough (〜 3 keV) with additional ECH to NBI plasma. The source of Ti impurity is Ti gettering, while the source of Cr and Fe impurities is stainless steel of vacuum vessel. The radial profiles of impurity line intensity can be reconstructed from the best fit of the contour of impurity line intensity calculated using equilibrium code to that measured with CCD camera. The reconstructed radial profiles of Ti, Cr and Fe K-alpha line intensity are localized at ρ< 0. 4, where the electron temperature exceeds 1. 0 keV as predicted by the temperature dependence of emission cross section of Ti, Cr and Fe, The concentrations of Ti, Cr and Fe measured with CCD camera are 0. 2 %, 0. 07 % and 0. 06 %, respectively. The radial intensity profiles of Ti K-alpha and Fe K-alpha lines agree with those calculated with the assumption of constant impurity concentration(nFe/ne= 0. 06 %, nCr/ne= 0. 07 %; nTi/ne= 0. 2 %) ...|$|E

The process of Electron-Cyclotron-Resonance (ECR) plasma acceleration has several potential applications including {{use as a}} new type of electric space propulsion device designated the ECR plasma engine. The ECR plasma engine is interesting due to its theoretical promise to deliver a combination of improved efficiency, specific impulse, power-handling capability, length of life, or operational flexibility relative to other electric propulsion devices now being developed. Besides its possible application in electric propulsion, the ECR plasma engine might be useful for beamed-energy propulsion or fusion propulsion. Related devices are used in the semiconductors field for plasma etching. This study includes theoretical modeling and a series of experimental measurements. The theoretical work was focused in two areas. The first area involved the development of a collisionless, steady-state, axisymmetric model of a cold flowing plasma separating from a diverging magnetic field. This model suggests that beam divergence can be an important loss mechanism for plasma propulsion devices that use magnetic nozzles, but that the use of optimized field geometries can reduce divergence losses to acceptable levels. We suggest that future research be directed at confirming theoretical predictions made using the axisymmetric model of beam separation. The second area of theoretical investigation involved the development of a steady-state, quasi-one-dimensional model that provides theoretical predictions of plasma density, electron temperature, plasma potential, ion energy, engine specific impulse, efficiency, and thrust. The quasi-one-dimensional model consists of a system of five first-order, nonlinear, ordinary differential equations. The boundary conditions required to solve the system of equations are relationships between the ambient neutral gas density, the plasma density, the two components of the electron temperature, and the position at which the plasma passes through the ion-acoustic Mach number 1. The model was used to solve two classes of problems that are thought to bound the conditions under which the ECR plasma accelerator operates. The first class of problem {{is based on the assumption}} of negligible conductive heat flow within the plasma. The second class of problem is based on the assumption that electron thermal transport along magnetic field lines is so large that the component of the electron temperature along magnetic field lines is isothermal. The model can be used to simulate accelerator operation in space or in the presence of a vacuum system with finite tank pressure. Measurements of plasma conditions in a working research device confirm the general features of the quasi-one-dimensional theory. The experimental apparatus constructed to study ECR plasma acceleration consists of a vacuum facility, a 20 -kW microwave power supply, and an ECR plasma accelerator. In tests of the facility we have measured microwave input power, reflected power, propellant flow rate, and vacuum-tank static pressure. The working ECR plasma research device uses argon propellant gas with 2. 12 -GHz microwave radiation at power levels of up to a few kilowatts. Among the plasma diagnostics employed in this research are a gridded energy analyzer, a Faraday cup beam-density analyzer, Langmuir probes, emissive probes, and a <b>diamagnetic</b> <b>loop.</b> With these diagnostics, we have measured plasma potentials of up to 70 eV and electron temperatures of up to 35 eV. Measurements of accelerated-ion kinetic energy show a direct relationship between ion energy and peak plasma potential, as predicted by theory. Indirect measurements indicate that the plasma density in the existing accelerator is on the order of [ [...] . ]. We now understand previously unexplained losses in converting microwave power to jet power by ECR plasma acceleration as the result of diffusion of energized plasma to the metallic walls of the accelerator. Our theory suggests that future researchers should attempt to reduce the influence of these diffusion losses by increasing the cross-sectional area of the accelerator. It may be possible to reduce line radiation losses due to electron-ion and electron-atom inelastic collisions below levels estimated by past researchers through careful accelerator design. Minimizing inelastic collision losses will place a limit on the maximum thrust density that can be achieved using argon and other non-hydrogenic propellant materials. High thrust density may be achievable using propellants that are isotopes of hydrogen because once ionized, these species exhibit negligible inelastic collision effects. Deuterium is arguably the best candidate for achieving both high efficiency and high thrust, but will only be effective at specific impulses of over about 10, 000 lbf s/lbm. We expect that efficient ECR plasma engines can be designed for use in high specific impulse spacecraft propulsion at power levels ranging from a few kilowatts to tens of megawatts. The maximum theoretical efficiency of converting applied microwave power to directed jet power in this device can be more than 60 percent. The achievable total efficiency of converting direct-current electric power to jet power in a propulsion system based on the ECR plasma engine will probably be considerably less...|$|E
