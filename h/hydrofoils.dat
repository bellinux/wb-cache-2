25|$|Boeing also {{developed}} <b>hydrofoils</b> in the 1960s. The screw-driven USS High Point (PCH-1) was an experimental submarine hunter. The patrol hydrofoil USS Tucumcari (PGH-2) was more successful. Only one was built, but it saw service in Vietnam and Europe before running aground in 1972. Its waterjet and fully submersed flying foils were the {{example for the}} later Pegasus-class patrol <b>hydrofoils</b> and the Model 929 Jetfoil ferries in the 1980s. The Tucumcari and later boats were produced in Renton. While the Navy <b>hydrofoils</b> were withdrawn from service in the late 1980s, the Boeing Jetfoils are still in service in Asia.|$|E

40|$|Classical super-cavitating <b>hydrofoil</b> {{performance}} predictions {{have been}} based on linearised potential theory for zero cavitation number. More rationalised predictions of super-cavitating <b>hydrofoil</b> performance have been evaluated using a non-linear boundary element formulation. Comparisons are made between flat-plate, circular-arc, and NACA 4 -digit camber line wetted surface profiles. Limitations of super-cavitating foil performance are defined in terms of minimum cavity length to avoid instability and the minimum cavity clearance from the <b>hydrofoil</b> wetted surface. The dependence of these limitations on <b>hydrofoil</b> wetted surface profile, incidence and cavitation number are derived...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} implementation of a turtle <b>hydrofoil</b> for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV). The final design of the AUV must have navigation performance like a turtle, which has also been the biomimetic inspiration {{for the design of}} the <b>hydrofoil</b> and propulsion system. The <b>hydrofoil</b> design is based on a National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) 0014 hydrodynamic profile. During the design stage, four different propulsion systems were compared in terms of propulsion path, compactness, sealing and required power. The final implementation is based on a ball-andsocket mechanism because it is very compact and provides three degrees of freedom (DoF) to the <b>hydrofoil</b> with very few restrictions on the propulsion path. The propulsion obtained with the final implementation of the <b>hydrofoil</b> has been empirically evaluated in a water channel comparing different motion strategies. The results obtained have confirmed that the proposed turtle <b>hydrofoil</b> controlled with a mechanism with three DoF generates can be used in the future implementation of the planned AUV...|$|R
25|$|<b>Hydrofoils</b> were {{introduced}} in 1965 to provide a high-speed service to Manly {{in an attempt to}} boost revenue. While they proved popular, their lack of mechanical reliability lead to their demise (they were ultimately replaced by the JetCats in the early 1990s).|$|E
25|$|The main {{transportation}} {{to the island}} is by boat or aircraft. <b>Hydrofoils</b> (kometas) and motorized catamarans will make the trip in between two and three hours, from Batabano to Nueva Gerona. A much slower and larger cargo ferry takes around six hours to make the crossing, but is cheaper.|$|E
25|$|Another use of foils is {{to provide}} lift, turning the boat into a hydrofoil. <b>Hydrofoils</b> require {{significant}} speeds to work, but once the hull is lifted out of the water, the drag is significantly reduced. Many speed sailing designs {{have been based on}} a proa type configuration equipped with lifting foils.|$|E
5000|$|A foilboard or <b>hydrofoil</b> {{board is}} a {{surfboard}} with a <b>hydrofoil</b> that extends below the board into the water. This design causes {{the board to}} leave {{the surface of the}} water at various speeds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hydrofoil</b> usually {{consists}} of a wing like structure mounted on struts below the hull, or across the keels of a catamaran {{in a variety of}} boats (see illustration). As a <b>hydrofoil</b> equipped watercraft increases in speed, the <b>hydrofoil</b> elements below the hull(s) develop enough lift to raise the hull out of the water, which greatly reduces hull drag. This provides a corresponding increase in speed and fuel efficiency.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, we analyze {{some aspects}} {{related to the}} {{propulsion}} of <b>hydrofoil</b> ships. They are {{very important for the}} success of the mission if they are military ships and for cargo security, if they are civilian transport ships, especially when navigating at high speed on their <b>hydrofoil</b> wings in rough sea conditions. This paper presents an original procedure for estimating the propulsion of <b>hydrofoil</b> ships. This procedure has enabled the development of a computer program that can predict both those types of ship propulsion regime imposed at a quasi-stationary speed and the march regime on wings. The calculation software obtained may serve to design any type of <b>hydrofoil</b> ship...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} the experimental setup and the results of the CFD analysis for the investigation of the unsteady cavitating flow around a prismatic NACA 2412 <b>hydrofoil</b> at different flow conditions. The experimental research is carried out in the cavitation water tunnel located in the Centre of Hydraulic Research in Lutín. The tunnel is integrated into the closed horizontal loop of the hydraulic test rig. The transparent test section provides a full view of the flow around the <b>hydrofoil.</b> The <b>hydrofoil</b> incidence angle is fully adjustable. Two variants of <b>hydrofoil</b> of the same geometry have been designed. One variant is equipped with pressure tap holes for the measurement of the static pressure, and the other variant is covered with a grid of five PVDF films, fully integrated in the <b>hydrofoil.</b> The PVDF films enable to measure the impact forces exerted on the <b>hydrofoil</b> surface by the collapsing cavitation structures. The high-frequency pressure oscillations downstream of the <b>hydrofoil</b> trailing edge are measured using the PVDF hydrophone. The cavitating flow is visualized using two simultaneously operating high-speed cameras providing the top and side views of the flow. A preliminary CFD analysis using the ANSYS CFX package helped to determine the flow regimes for the experimental study. The obtained CFD results agree well with the preliminary measurements. ...|$|R

50|$|The sit-down <b>hydrofoil,</b> first {{developed}} in the late 1980s, is a variation on water skiing, a popular water sport.
