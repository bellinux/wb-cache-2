5|$|He {{spent the}} 1964–65 season {{playing for the}} reserve side. On 1 January 1965 he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for {{services}} to football) whilst still an active professional player; though he never thought himself worthy of such an honour. His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League game of his career; <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated by injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3–1. Though {{he felt he had}} retired too early, and could have carried on playing for another two years, this brought an end to his 35-year professional career.|$|E
5|$|On December 14, 1998 the Yugoslav Army (VJ) ambushed a {{group of}} 140 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) militants {{attempting}} to smuggle weapons and supplies from their base in Albania into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. A five-hour battle ensued, ending with the deaths of 36 militants and the capture of a further nine. Dozens more fled back to Albania, abandoning large quantities of weapons and supplies, which were subsequently seized by the Yugoslav authorities. The ambush was the most serious war-related incident in Kosovo since a U.S.-negotiated truce took effect two months before. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> the heels of increasing tensions in the province, where inter-ethnic violence had been escalating steadily since early 1996.|$|E
5|$|On {{the second}} {{play of the}} third quarter, Alabama scored their first {{touchdown}} of the game. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> a 68-yard T. J. Yeldon run and gave the Crimson Tide a 16–0 lead. Each team again traded punts before the Alabama defense stopped an Ole Miss scoring opportunity on a fourth-and-two play from their own seven-yard line that kept the score 16–0. In the fourth, Cody Mandell had a punt downed at the Rebels' one-yard line and on the next play, C. J. Mosley sacked Ole Miss quarterback Bo Wallace for a safety and an 18–0 lead. On the next offensive play for Alabama after they received the safety kick, Kenyan Drake scored on a 50-yard touchdown run that made the final score 25–0. The shutout was the first for the Rebels since their loss against Arkansas in 1998. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Rebels to 47–9–2 (51–8–2 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E

However, if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> within the word, the letter is repeated; if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>on</b> a ‘shaviyani’ or ‘alif’ {{at the end of a}} word, it signifies the sound ‘h’; if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>on</b> a ‘thaa’, the sound is replaced by ‘iy’.|$|R

25|$|In 1996, after {{appearing}} on advanced placement and {{local high school}} reading lists in Round Rock Independent school district, the novel came to parents attention, which according to Foerstel led to “seven hours of boisterous debate over a proposal to remove a dozen books”, {{one of which was}} Bless Me, Ultima. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> January 19, 1996 from Round Rock Independent School District Board member Nelda Click. One of the worries of the parents was excessive violence. However, a local paper, The Austin American Statesman, claimed “ Refusing to allow credit for those celebrated literary works would have been an unnecessary intrusion by the school board.” After multiple hearing and proposals, the board came to a 4-2 vote against the banning of the book.|$|E
25|$|The final German {{attack was}} {{launched}} towards Amiens. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> 4 April, when fifteen divisions attacked seven Allied divisions {{on a line}} east of Amiens and north of Albert (towards the Avre River). Ludendorff decided to attack the outermost eastern defences of Amiens centred on the town of Villers-Bretonneux. His aim was to secure that town and the surrounding high ground from which artillery bombardments could systematically destroy Amiens and render it useless to the Allies. The fighting was remarkable on two counts: the first use of tanks simultaneously by {{both sides in the}} war and a night counter-attack hastily organised by the Australian and British units (including the exhausted 54th Brigade) which re-captured Villers-Bretonneux and halted the German advance. From north to south, the line was held by the 14th Division, 35th Australian Battalion and 18th Division. By 4 April the 14th Division fell back under attack from the German 228th Division. The Australians repulsed the 9th Bavarian Reserve Division and the British 18th Division held off the German Guards Ersatz Division and 19th divisions in the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux.|$|E

500|$|Hurricane Ione [...] was a strong, Category4 {{hurricane}} {{that affected}} North Carolina in September 1955, bringing high winds and significant rainfall. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> {{the heels of}} Hurricanes Connie and Diane, and compounded problems already caused by the two earlier hurricanes. [...] Spawned by a tropical wave which left the African coast on September 6, the system became a tropical depression in the tropical North Atlantic, before turning northwest and developing into a hurricane. [...] After {{turning back to the}} west east of the Bahamas, Ione turned northwest and northward, moving across eastern North Carolina before moving east-northeastward out to sea. [...] Ione caused $600million (2005USD) in damage, much of it to crops across North Carolina. As a result of Ione's impacts seven people lost their lives.|$|E
500|$|Beneath a Steel Sky was {{published}} in March 1994 by Virgin Interactive on floppy disks and CD-ROM. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> 15 floppy disks, as opposed to Lure of The Temptress, which came on four. Because of the Amiga restrictions, a few animations had to be left out, as not all Amiga owners had a hard drive.

Sporting a 3–2 record, Hansen earned his first career save against the Phillies on August 6, pitching two scoreless innings in relief of Harry Feldman and striking out two. It was his only save of the season. He lost his third decision of the year on August 19, allowing five runs and walking six batters in the Giants' 12th consecutive loss out of a season-long 13-game streak. For his rookie season, Hansen finished with a 3–3 record and a 6.49 ERA in [...] innings pitched; he appeared in 23 games (4 starts) and struck out 15 batters while walking 32 at age 19.|$|E

[...] According to Broderick, Ferris's singing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] in the shower was his idea. [...] "Although it's only because of the brilliance of John's deciding that I should sing [...] "Danke Schoen" [...] on the float in the parade. I had never heard the song before. I was learning it for the parade scene. So we're doing the shower scene and I thought, 'Well, I can do a little rehearsal.' And I did something with my hair to make that Mohawk.

500|$|... "Pilot" [...] {{was filmed}} {{over the course}} of a month, which was an unheard-of length of time for a single {{television}} episode. The episode was shot in Vancouver, British Columbia in early spring to give it a [...] "gray" [...] and [...] "bleak" [...] look. The decision to film in Vancouver was to give the show the same dark feel as its sister show The X-Files, which had also been created by Carter. The strip club, Ruby Tip, was inspired by a club in Seattle named the Lusty Lady, which is located on that city's main street. Director David Nutter had been a long-time staff member of The X-Files crew. Carter said the episode was [...] "directed beautifully by David Nutter who added to the project in so many ways, even as <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>on,</b> things that he saw visually that were able to actually change and make the script more concise". Although [...] "Pilot" [...] did not open with a literary quote as the series would do from the next episode onwards, its plot heavily features the 1919 poem [...] "The Second Coming" [...] by Irish poet William Butler Yeats.|$|E
500|$|The group's {{voices are}} {{presented}} individually on the record. Savan Kotecha {{noted that the}} Backstreet Boys' late-’90s hits inspired the way he formulated One Direction's voices for the album. Composer Julian Bunetta, who worked on three of Take Me Home tracks, also tried to place emphasis on the sound of each member: [...] "The fans can tell the difference, {{but we wanted to}} make sure that when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>on</b> the radio, the average person knew that it must be One Direction, because it’s five guys." [...] Likewise, Caramanica noted that the album's songs produced by Bunetta [...] "tend to start out with more breathing room, giving the guys a chance to show off vocally". The album's lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what make a person unique, and commitment, in songs such as [...] "Little Things," [...] "Last First Kiss," [...] "Back For You," [...] and [...] "They Don't Know About Us." [...] Other tracks, like [...] "Heart Attack," [...] "Rock Me," [...] "I Would," [...] and [...] "Over Again," [...] have a more solemn tone, addressing jealousy and longing for past significant others.|$|E
