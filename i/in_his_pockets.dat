5|$|The first Guardian video shows {{one officer}} lunge at Tomlinson from behind, strike {{him across the}} legs with a baton and push his back, causing him to fall. On 8 April Channel4 News {{released}} their own footage, which showed the officer's arm swing back to head height before bringing it down to hit Tomlinson on the legs with the baton. Another video obtained by The Guardian on 21 April shows Tomlinson standing by a bicycle rack, hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> when the police approach him. After he is hit, he can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side}} of his forehead; eyewitnesses spoke of hearing a noise as his head hit the ground.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{was ready}} {{to carry out the}} {{assassination}} on July21. He wore a new suit and a black derby hat, and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> he had a gun and a dagger fashioned from a steel file. He went to Frick's office and asked to see him, saying he was the representative of a New York hiring agency, but he was told Frick was too busy to meet him. The following night, Berkman checked into a hotel under the name Rakhmetov, his role model from What Is to Be Done? On July23, he returned to Frick's office. While the attendant told Frick that the New York employment agent had returned to see him, Berkman burst into the office and took aim at Frick's head. After two shots, Berkman was tackled to the ground. Still, he managed to pull out the dagger and stab Frick three times.|$|E
5|$|The Guardian {{obtained}} a four-minute video on 21 April from an anonymous bystander {{who had been}} filming on Cornhill between 7:10 and 7:30pm. The footage shows Tomlinson standing behind a bicycle rack in Royal Exchange Passage with his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> {{and a group of}} advancing police officers. When a police dog approaches him, he turns his back. At that point, he is hit on the legs and pushed by the TSG constable, and can be seen scraping along the ground {{on the right side of}} his forehead. Eyewitnesses said they heard a noise as his head hit the ground. The IPCC sought an injunction against the broadcast of the video by Channel4 News, but a judge rejected the application. An image obtained by Sky News on 24 April appears to show bruising on the right side of Tomlinson's forehead. A head injury was recorded by the second and third pathologists.|$|E
50|$|Amour de poche (Girl <b>in</b> <b>His</b> <b>Pocket)</b> is a French comedy fantasy {{film from}} 1957, {{directed}} by Pierre Kast, written by France Roche, starring Jean Marais. The scenario {{was based on}} a novel Diminishing Draft of Waldemar Kamempfert. The film was known under the title Girl <b>in</b> <b>His</b> <b>Pocket</b> (US), Alchimie der Liebe (West Germany), Nude <b>in</b> <b>His</b> <b>Pocket.</b>|$|R

25|$|In {{addition}} to using his home-made guitar {{he prefers to}} use coins (especially a sixpence from the farewell proof set of 1970), instead of a more traditional plastic plectrum, {{on the basis that}} their rigidity gives him more control in playing. He is known to carry coins <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> specifically for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eight}} Harry Potter films {{screened}} from 2001 to 2011, Harry Potter has been portrayed by British actor Daniel Radcliffe. Radcliffe {{was asked to}} audition {{for the role of}} Harry in 2000 by producer David Heyman, while in attendance at a play titled Stones <b>in</b> <b>His</b> <b>Pockets</b> in London. The role has been highly lucrative for Radcliffe; as of 2015, he had an estimated wealth of $110 million and was paid a collective $53 million for the last two films.|$|E
25|$|During the First and Second World Wars {{there were}} large {{military}} {{camps in the}} town. In the First World War the camps were built to house 22nd Division, Kitchener's Third New Army. The south camp nearly encircled Seaford ladies college. In December 1914 there was a strike by a mainly Welsh regiment over the remoteness of the accommodation and mud. In 1919 two thousand Canadians rioted after {{one of them was}} beaten by a camp picket for walking with his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b>|$|E

25|$|Between {{midnight and}} 8:00a.m. on June 3, 1961, a {{burglary}} {{occurred at the}} Bay Harbor Pool Room in Panama City, Florida. An unknown person broke a door, smashed a cigarette machine and a record player, and stole money from a cash register. Later that day, a witness {{reported that he had}} seen Clarence Earl Gideon in the poolroom at around 5:30 that morning, leaving with a wine bottle and money <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> Based on this accusation alone, the police arrested Gideon and charged him with breaking and entering with intent to commit petty larceny.|$|E
25|$|He {{developed}} a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught catechism to them. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him {{and talk to them}} about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons in the courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to reclaim children from religious ignorance.|$|E
25|$|In 1894, he bowled 422 overs {{for his new}} county, conceding just 516 {{runs and}} {{capturing}} 41 wickets. The following year, at Trent Bridge (when {{it was so cold}} that KS Ranjitsinhji kept his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> and fielded the ball with his feet), Shaw bowled 100.1 five-ball overs as his former team accrued a gargantuan 726. He finally retired again two matches later, when Sussex drew against Middlesex, and only ever returned to the first-class scene in 1897 to play the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. He subsequently became a publican and died aged 64.|$|E

25|$|An {{investigator}} later {{testified that}} 146 spent shell casings were recovered inside the building. Another 68 casings were collected outside, {{for a total}} of 214 rounds fired by the attacker and responding police officers. A medic who treated Hasan said his pockets were full of pistol magazines. When the shooting ended, he was still carrying 177 rounds of unfired ammunition <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets,</b> contained in both 20- and 30-round magazines. The incident, which lasted about 10 minutes, resulted in 13 killed12 soldiers and one civilian; 11 died at the scene, and two died later in a hospital; and 30 people wounded.|$|E
25|$|The bridge became internationally notorious in June 1982, {{when the}} body of Roberto Calvi, a former {{chairman}} of Italy's largest private bank, was found hanging from one of its arches with five bricks and around $14,000 in three different currencies <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> Calvi's death was initially treated as suicide, but he was on the run from Italy accused of embezzlement and in 2002 forensic experts concluded that he had been murdered by the Mafia, to whom he was indebted. In 2005, five suspected members of the Mafia were tried in a Rome court for Calvi's murder, but all were acquitted in June 2007 for lack of evidence.|$|E
25|$|One {{night while}} working the late shift, he killed a man. Authorities briefly arrested him, but Quantrill {{claimed that he}} had acted in self-defense. Since there were no eyewitnesses and the victim was a {{stranger}} who knew no one in town, William was set free. Nevertheless, the police strongly urged him to leave Mendota. Quantrill continued {{his career as a}} teacher, moving to Fort Wayne, Indiana in February 1856. The district was impressed with Quantrill's teaching abilities, but unfortunately the wages remained meager. Quantrill journeyed back home to Canal Dover that fall, with no more money <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> than when he had left.|$|E

25|$|Much {{controversy}} surrounded Selig and {{his involvement}} in Bonds' all-time home run record chase. For months, speculation surrounded Selig {{and the possibility that}} he and Henry Aaron would not attend Bonds' games as he closed in on the record. Selig announced in July 2007 when Bonds was near 755 home runs that he would attend the games. Selig was in attendance for Bonds' record-tying home run against the San Diego Padres, sitting in Padres owner John Moores' private suite. When Bonds hit his 755th home run, Selig refused to applaud Bonds' accomplishment, instead choosing to keep his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> and have a look of disdain on his face. Bud Selig also did not attend the San Francisco Giants' game on August 7 when Barry Bonds hit his record-breaking 756th home run against the Washington Nationals; after the event, Selig released a statement congratulating Bonds.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{exhumation}} of Calvi's body in December 1998, an Italian court {{commissioned a}} German forensic scientist {{to repeat the}} work produced by Katz and his forensic team. That report was published in October 2002, {{ten years after the}} original, and confirmed the first report. In addition, it said that the injuries to Calvi's neck were inconsistent with hanging and that he had not touched the bricks found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> When Calvi's body was found, the level of the River Thames had receded with the tide, giving the scene the appearance of a suicide by hanging, but at the exact time of his death, the place on the scaffolding where the rope had been tied could have been reached by a person standing in a boat. That had also been the conclusion of a separate report by Katz in 1992, which also detailed a reconstruction based on Calvi's last known movements in London and theorized that Calvi had been taken by boat from a point of access to the Thames in West London.|$|E
25|$|After {{arriving}} in Bannack, Idaho Territory, Edgerton reported to Territorial Governor William Wallace. Edgerton requested {{the designation of}} courts and districts, but no court was designated for his district. Wallace appointed Edgerton {{to one of the}} farthest and most remote places away from the capitol. When he arrived there was no administrator to administer the oath of office. He never took the oath of office and therefore he never legally took his position as Chief Justice. The Edgerton's then bought a home at a Sheriff's sale for $400. The one room home became the first Montana Governor's Residence. After {{arriving in}} his district, he began taking tours of the territory gold fields and gold camps. Edgerton realized the value of the gold fields, to the Union. He was then chosen, by the local population, to go to Washington D.C.. His mission was to lobby for the split of the Territory of Idaho. Edgerton and Sanders then left in a stagecoach for Washington. Edgerton arrived with $2,500 in gold nuggets <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> (about $34,000 in 2009). He presented this to President Abraham Lincoln and numerous members of Congress. His lobbying paid off in 1864. That year the Territory of Idaho split into three parts. The three parts included the Territory of Idaho, the Territory of Montana, and the Territory of Dakota.|$|E

25|$|As Kevin {{is leaving}} for the library {{to find out how}} to forge free papers for Dana, she feels the {{dizziness}} coming back. This time, Kevin holds on to her and also travels to the past. They find Rufus writhing in pain from a broken leg. Next to him is a black boy named Nigel, whom they send to the main house for help. Rufus reacts with violent disbelief when he finds out that Kevin and Dana are married: whites and blacks are not allowed to marry in his time. Dana and Kevin then explain to Rufus that they are from the future and prove it by showing the dates stamped on the coins Kevin carries <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets.</b> Rufus promises to keep their identity a secret, and Dana tells Kevin to pretend that he is her owner. When Tom Weylin arrives with his slave Luke to retrieve Rufus, Kevin introduces himself. Weylin grudgingly invites him to dinner. Once back in the Weylin plantation, Margaret, Rufusâ€™s mother, fusses about her son's well-being and, jealous of the attention Rufus shows Dana, sends Dana to the cookhouse. There, Dana meets two house slaves: Sarah, the cook; and Carrie, her mute daughter. Unsure as to what their next move should be, Kevin accepts Weylin's offer to become Rufus's tutor. Kevin and Dana stay on the plantation for several weeks. They observe the relentless cruelty and torture that is rained down upon the slaves by the cold and practical Weylin, the petty and hysterical Margaret, and the capricious and spoiled Rufus. While none are sadistic or evil, they all feel entitled to treat the slaves as property. Weylin catches Dana reading and whips her mercilessly. The dizziness overcomes her before Kevin can reach her and she travels back to 1976 alone.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} {{attempted}} arrest of the graffiti man, Harwood swung a coat at a protester, pulled a BBC camera{{man to the}} ground, used a palm strike against one man, and at 7:19 pm pushed another man to the ground for allegedly threatening a police dog handler. It was seconds after this that he saw Tomlinson standing with his hands <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> beside a bicycle rack, being told by police to move away. Harwood told the inquest he made a [...] "split-second decision" [...] that there was justification for engagement, then struck Tomlinson on the thigh with his baton and pushed him to the ground. He {{said it was a}} [...] "very poor push" [...] and he had been shocked when Tomlinson fell. Harwood made no mention of the incident in his notebook; he told the inquest he had forgotten about it.|$|E
500|$|On 19 August, {{an arrest}} warrant was issued {{in the name of}} George Veck, an {{acquaintance}} of Hammond's who pretended to be a clergyman. Veck had actually worked at the Telegraph Office, but had been sacked for [...] "improper conduct" [...] with the messenger boys. A seventeen-year-old youth found in Veck's London lodgings revealed to the police that Veck had gone to Portsmouth and was returning shortly by train. The police arrested Veck at London Waterloo railway station. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>pockets</b> they discovered letters from Algernon Allies. Abberline sent Constable Hanks to interview Allies at his parents' home in Sudbury, Suffolk. Allies admitted to receiving money from Somerset, having a sexual relationship with him, and working at Cleveland Street for Hammond. On 22 August, police interviewed Somerset for a second time, after which Somerset left for Bad Homburg, where the Prince of Wales was taking his summer holiday.|$|E
