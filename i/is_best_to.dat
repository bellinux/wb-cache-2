5|$|Maine Coons require ample {{protein and}} {{nutrients}} in their diets. Since {{they are a}} large cat breed {{with high levels of}} energy, it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> feed them quality food. Food that lists meat as the first ingredient is best for the Maine Coon.|$|E

5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them that when you have done something really stupid, it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> admit it.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a council}} of war held to {{consider}} what it <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do. It <b>was</b> a council of perplexity and despair. Nobody could tell what it <b>was</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> do. To go back was disgrace. To go forward was destruction; and {{it was impossible for}} them to remain where they were.|$|R

5|$|Carménère wine has a {{deep red}} color and aromas found in red fruits, spices and berries. The tannins are gentler and softer than those in Cabernet Sauvignon {{and it is a}} medium body wine. As a result many find it can be drunk easily with fish. Although mostly used as a {{blending}} grape, wineries do bottle a pure varietal Carménère which, when produced from grapes at optimal ripeness, imparts a cherry-like, fruity flavor with smoky, spicy and earthy notes and a deep crimson color. Its taste might also be reminiscent of dark chocolate, tobacco, and leather. The wine <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> drink while it is young.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{thought that}} in a Victorian setting, {{long-haired}} girls tended to become the central character. After considering this, she believed a short-haired girl would stand out more and be much cuter. However, her editor wanted the character to have long hair, believing this would be better received by readers. As a result, Lenalee has long hair in the early chapters of the manga. Nevertheless, Hoshino took advantage of Lenalee's fight against the Level 3 Akuma to generate an impact strong enough to cause her to lose some of her hair in the process. Hoshino paid the most attention to Lenalee's uniform wanting to design clothing that would be sexually appealing. As a result, her uniform included a mini-skirt. However, Hoshino notes that the design does not fit with the manga's setting and states that it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> treat Lenalee's uniform as fan service.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{confusion in the}} literature over the naming of Russula brevipes. Some early 20th-century American mycologists {{referred to it as}} Russula delica, although that fungus was described from Europe by Elias Fries with a description not accurately matching the North American counterparts. Fries's concept of R.delica included: a white fruit body that did not change color; a smooth, shiny cap; and thin, widely spaced gills. To add to the confusion, Rolf Singer and later Robert Kühner and Henri Romagnesi described other species they named Russula delica. Robert Shaffer summarized the taxonomic conundrum in 1964: Russula delica is a species that everybody knows, so to speak, but the evidence indicates that R.delica sensu Fries (1838) is not R.delica sensu Singer (1938), which in turn is not R.delica sensu Kühner and Romagnesi (1953)…It <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> use R.brevipes for the North American collections which most authors but not Kühner and Romagnesi (1953), call R.delica. The name, R.brevipes, is attached to a type collection, has a reasonably explicit original description, and provides a stable point about which a species concept can be formed.|$|E

25|$|If {{a person}} has {{difficulty}} removing a tick, or has {{reason to be concerned}} about allergic reactions, it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> seek professional medical attention. The process of removing ticks in humans has been associated with anaphylactic reactions and so it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> have appropriate medical supplies (oxygen, adrenaline) ready.|$|E

25|$|As {{with any}} {{supplements}} and drugs, it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> confer with a veterinarian {{as to the}} recommended dosages. Some drugs are not allowed in competition and {{may need to be}} withheld a few days before.|$|E

25|$|If {{signs of}} ER are seen, the horse {{should not be}} moved. Movement can cause further muscle damage. If the animal {{is far from the}} barn, it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> trailer him back rather than move him.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{receiving}} palliative radiation {{to treat}} uncomplicated painful bone metastasis should not receive {{more than a}} single fraction of radiation. A single treatment gives comparable pain relief and morbidity outcomes to multiple-fraction treatments, and for patients with limited life expectancy, a single treatment <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> improve patient comfort.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in lightly used {{wilderness}} areas, it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> replace {{anything that}} was moved while preparing the fire site, and scatter {{anything that was}} gathered, so that it looks as natural as possible.

25|$|Work {{in small}} circles is {{stressful}} on a horse's legs, so it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> limit a longeing session to about 20 minutes.

25|$|No single {{treatment}} {{works for}} all cases, probably {{because there is}} no single cause for all cases. The degenerative changes are usually quite advanced by the time the horse is consistently lame, and these changes are believed to be non-reversible. At this time, it <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> manage the condition and focus on alleviating pain and slowing the degeneration.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> go early, preferably {{arriving}} before 08.00 am, {{and proceed}} {{directly to the}} lift to the observation tower. The lift has a capacity of perhaps 160 people per hour so long queues build up quickly. The {{other parts of the}} monument, including the dioramas in the hall below the Monas, can be viewed later.|$|E
