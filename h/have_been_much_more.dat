5|$|However, pay would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{attractive}} in higher-grade units. The {{top of the}} pay pyramid were the scholae elite cavalry regiments. Next came palatini units, then comitatenses, and finally limitanei. There is little evidence about the pay differentials between grades. But that they were substantial is shown by the example that an actuarius (quartermaster) of a comitatus regiment was paid 50% more than his counterpart in a pseudocomitatensis regiment.|$|E
5|$|The species {{occurs in}} coastal regions of Southwest Australia, from Gingin and Muchea north of Perth south to Augusta and east {{along the south}} coast to Green Range, east of Albany. It also occurs in the Stirling Range, a {{possible}} disjunction; and at Narrogin, a certain and substantial disjunction. Nelson tentatively explains these disjunct populations in terms of natural climate fluctuations: during times of higher rainfall, the distribution of A.obovatus would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> extensive. Reductions in rainfall would cause the distribution to contract, but isolated populations could survive in favourable refugia.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, his 1980s musical {{repertoire}} {{presented an}} increased development of dance trends, such as disco and soul, {{as well as}} the previous incorporation of rock and punk. However, Gil says that his 1994 album Acoustic was not such a new direction, as he had previously performed unplugged with Caetano Veloso. He describes the method of playing as easier than other types of performance, as the energy of acoustic playing is simple and influenced by its roots. Gil has been criticized for a conflicting involvement in both authentic Brazilian music and the worldwide musical arena. He has had to walk a fine line, simultaneously remaining true to traditional Bahian styles and engaging with commercial markets. Listeners in Bahia <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> accepting of his blend of music styles, while those in southeast Brazil felt at odds with it.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the heavy}} Polish casualties—or {{according}} to one historian, possibly because of them—the battle has been largely neglected in Polish historiography. During {{the period of the}} People's Republic of Poland it was portrayed merely as a difficult but victorious battle. However, since the fall of communism modern Polish historians <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> critical of Świerczewski's command, blaming his drive on Dresden for the near destruction of the Polish force. Świerczewski's lack of competence, according to some sources, included commanding the battle while drunk. He was briefly relieved of command by Marshal Konev, but due to the backing of the Soviet high command (most likely the NKVD) he not only retained his position but all controversies were hushed up, and after the war was hailed as a hero. The actions of other Polish officers have also been questioned, such as the 9th Infantry Division commander's decision to advance without sufficient reconnaissance and escort.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have varied}} interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall {{as one of}} the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 Time {{magazine}} article. Samuel Eliot Morison wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidency, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of Adolf Hitler, which began in the following year. Morison {{and a number of other}} historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of the presidency would have made World War II much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from office, even temporarily.|$|E

5|$|Debate {{has been}} going on about whether the tail spikes were used for display only, as posited by Gilmore in 1914 or used as a weapon. Robert Bakker noted the tail was likely to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{flexible}} than that of other dinosaurs, as it lacked ossified tendons, thus lending credence to the idea of the tail as a weapon. However, as Carpenter has noted, the plates overlap so many tail vertebrae, movement would be limited. Bakker also observed that Stegosaurus could have maneuvered its rear easily, by keeping its large hind limbs stationary and pushing off with its very powerfully muscled but short fore limbs, allowing it to swivel deftly to deal with attack. More recently, a study of tail spikes by McWhinney et al., which showed a high incidence of trauma-related damage, lends more weight to the position that the spikes were indeed used in combat. This study showed that 9.8% of Stegosaurus specimens examined had injuries to their tail spikes. Additional support for this idea was a punctured tail vertebra of an Allosaurus into which a tail spike fits perfectly.|$|E
5|$|The {{interiors}} of most Norfolk churches contain much pre-Reformation graffiti, {{unless they have}} been heavily limewashed or resurfaced. The churches of the Glaven ports in general, and Blakeney in particular, conform to this pattern. St Nicholas has an extensive array of prayers, merchant's marks and other symbols, but is notable for {{the large number of}} depictions of ships, at least 30, heavily concentrated in the nave towards the eastern end of the south aisle. There is a side altar there of unknown dedication, and an empty niche that would have once held the image of a saint. The pillars were painted red in the Middle Ages, and ship images scratched into the soft, chalky stone would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> conspicuous than they are now. It is likely that the images, mostly of smaller ships, were created as votive offerings by the seafaring inhabitants of the port. The carving of ship graffiti in religious buildings is a tradition in ports going back to the Bronze Age, and has been found across Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> simple and not designed for viewing, {{with most of the}} other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} and {{most important of all}} Indo-European mythologies is Vedic mythology, especially the mythology of the Rigveda, the oldest of the Vedas.

Modern researchers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> cautious, recognizing that, although Vedic mythology is still central, other mythologies must also be taken into account.|$|E
25|$|The {{ties between}} {{forestry}} and farming were mutually beneficial. Farmers supplemented their incomes with earnings from selling their wood, caring for forests, or logging; forestry made many otherwise marginal farms viable. At the same time, farming communities maintained roads and other infrastructure in rural areas, and they provided workers for forest operations. Indeed, without the farming communities in sparsely populated areas, it would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult to continue intensive logging operations and reforestation in many prime forest areas.|$|E

The incremental benefits of maglev technology have often been hard to justify against cost and risk, especially where there is an existing or proposed conventional high speed train line with spare passenger carrying capacity, as in continental Europe, the UK and Japan.|$|E

25|$|The Rimé {{movement}} was a 19th-century movement involving the Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma schools of Tibetan Buddhism, {{along with some}} Bon scholars. Having seen how the Gelug institutions pushed the other traditions into the corners of Tibet's cultural life, Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo (1820-1892) and Jamgön Kongtrül (1813-1899) compiled together {{the teachings of the}} Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma, including many near-extinct teachings. Without Khyentse and Kongtrul's collecting and printing of rare works, the suppression of Buddhism by the Communists would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> final. The Rimé movement is responsible for a number of scriptural compilations, such as the Rinchen Terdzod and the Sheja Dzö.|$|E
25|$|Isabella {{played an}} {{important}} role in Mantua during the city's troubled times. When her husband was captured in 1509 and held hostage in Venice, she took control of Mantua's military forces and held off their invaders until his release in 1512. In the same year, 1512, she was the hostess at the Congress of Mantua, which was held to settle questions concerning Florence and Milan. As a ruler, she appeared to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> assertive and competent than her husband. When apprised of this fact upon his return, Francesco was furious and humiliated at being upstaged by his wife's superior political ability. This caused their marriage to break down irrevocably. As a result, Isabella began to travel freely and live independently from her husband until his death on 19 March 1519.|$|E
25|$|Lambroch bridge {{could be}} a bridge over the Annick, however {{it seems to be}} located by Pont where the Brackenburn has its {{confluence}} with the Garrier (Previously Gawreer) burn.

The Garrier burn is now seasonal as its headwaters are the drained loch at Lochside near Buiston, pronounced 'Biston', (previously Buston).
