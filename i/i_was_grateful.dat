[...] In July 1946, Braven Dyer wrote that USC had found [...] "a new backfield star." [...] Dyer continued, [...] "Fresh out of the Marines, the lad's name is Doll, Don Doll, that is." [...] Doll had changed his surname from [...] "Burnside" [...] to [...] "Doll" [...] after being {{discharged from}} the military.

40|$|United States, a {{great friend}} warned me against making the vain mistake of believing that what <b>I</b> would {{accomplish}} <b>is</b> entirely due to my efforts. He said that without God’s providence and protection and without the generous support of great mentors; nothing gets accomplished. In my journey towards the PhD, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> blessed with both. First, I {{would like to acknowledge}} the unconditional support of my advisor; Dr. David Chapman. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> thankful to Dr. Chapman for accepting me among his advisees. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> for his foresight in steering me to research parental involvement. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> for his financial support for my trip to collect the dissertation data. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> for all the professional gates that he has opened for me since I joined the PhD program.

60|$|I was a {{very lonely}} child, with no playmates or companions of any sort, and my girlhood was lonelier still. The only passion in my life was my love for my father.

60|$|Somehow, {{her stories}} began to affect me {{in spite of}} myself. There were times when I felt very dreary. Perhaps Aunt Philippa was right. Perhaps men possessed neither truth nor constancy.
