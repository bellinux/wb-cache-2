5|$|At {{the same}} time, in 1980, {{geologist}} Walter Alvarez and his father, Nobel Prize-winning scientist Luis Walter Alvarez, put forth his hypothesis {{that a large}} extraterrestrial body had struck Earth. In 1981, unaware of Penfield's discovery, University of Arizona graduate student Alan R. Hildebrand and faculty adviser William V. Boynton published a draft Earth-impact theory and sought a candidate crater. Their evidence included greenish-brown clay with surplus iridium containing shocked quartz grains and small weathered glass beads that looked to be tektites. Thick, jumbled deposits of coarse rock fragments were also present, {{thought to have been}} scoured from one place and deposited elsewhere by a megatsunami resulting from an Earth impact. Such deposits occur in many locations but seem concentrated in the Caribbean basin at the K–Pg boundary. So when Haitian professor Florentine Morás discovered what he thought to be evidence of an ancient volcano on Haiti, Hildebrand suggested it could be a telltale feature of a nearby <b>impact.</b> <b>Tests</b> on samples retrieved from the K–Pg boundary revealed more tektite glass, formed only in the heat of asteroid impacts and high-yield nuclear detonations.|$|E

25|$|Driving to Champion Stadium for {{the first}} day of {{workouts}} for pitchers and catchers, Braves starter Tommy Hanson was involved in a one-car accident that caused him to bump his head around seven in the morning on February 20, 2012. After arriving at the stadium, Hanson informed the medical staff of the incident, stating that he was feeling abnormal. Seeking medical attention, Hanson was diagnosed with a Grade 1 concussion, providing a delay in his Spring workouts. The Braves medical staff performed several concussion <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> on Hanson to gauge when a return to normal workouts would be appropriate. Hanson did not expect to miss his first start of the regular season. After a full recovery and ample time for preparation during Spring training, Hanson was assigned as the Opening Day starter, making his first start against the New York Mets on April 5.|$|E
40|$|The <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> {{represents}} one of the main tools used by clinicians to assess the presence and severity of a student athlete's concussion (ImPACT Applications, Inc., 2011). Although past research has verified the utility of the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> for assessing cognitive status after concussion, no research has examined the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test's</b> potential for predicting athletic performance in non-concussed athletes (ImPACT Applications, Inc., 2011). This study investigated whether particular composite scores on the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> can predict athletic performance. The composite scores on the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> include Verbal Memory, Visual Memory, Visual Motor Speed, Reaction Time, and Impulse Control. Previous literature showed that broad cognitive domains such as impulse control correlated with athletic performance (Kida & Matsumura, 2005). University of Arizona baseball players' freshman <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> scores were correlated with their freshman year batting statistics, including batting average, slugging percentage, on-base percentage, strikeouts, and walks. The results showed no significant association between measures from the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> and the batting statistics. Therefore, the study suggests that the <b>ImPACT</b> <b>test</b> may possess no predictive ability for athletic performance in a non-concussed population...|$|R

25|$|For 1974, a new {{rear bumper}} system {{replaced}} the squared tail and chrome rear bumper blades introduced in 1968 with a trim, tapering urethane cover carrying an integral license plate holder and recesses for the trademark round taillights.
