50|$|The Limpopo girdled lizard is {{sometimes}} {{classified as a}} subspecies of the tropical girdled lizard (Cordylus tropidosternum). When both species are held together, the Limpopo girdled lizard has a noticeably shorter snout. The nostril pierces {{the center of the}} nasal scale (the lower posterior corner of the nasal in C. tropidosternum). Scales on the throat and belly of Limpopo girdled lizards are smooth instead of <b>keeled.</b> Limpopo girdled <b>lizards</b> are exported from Mozambique for the pet trade, where they are often mislabeled as Cordylus vittifer. They make hardy captives, feeding on insects and other small arthropods.|$|R
