40|$|The {{relation}} between the American Psychiatric Association&# 039;s (APA) <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manuals</b> (DSMs) <b>and</b> asexuality is likely to constitute a prolific direction in research, especially because of the diagnostic category &# 039;hypoactive sexual desire disorder&# 039; (HSDD). This article investigates the concept of sexual desire as outlined by psychiatry and explores {{the ways in which}} asexuality disrupts that knowledge. By extension, I consider the model of sexuality that the DSM vehiculates. The manuals themselves provide no measures, no scales, and no defined norms, yet, simultaneously, assume a normative sexuality against which all others can be measured and classified. This article discusses the conceptualisation of &# 039;sexual dysfunctions&# 039; in the DSM, of which HSDD is a part, and questions how it operates in clinical research into asexuality. I also pay attention to the clause of &# 039;personal distress&# 039; in HSDD, since it appears {{to be one of the}} main differences between HSDD and asexuality. HSDD, asexuality, and the role played by the DSM poses questions such as what discourses, forms of knowledge, and institutions, have shaped, silenced, and eventually erased, asexuality...|$|R
5|$|In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association listed {{homosexuality}} in the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> (DSM) as {{a mental}} disorder.

This view was widely influential in the medical profession. In 1956, however, the psychologist Evelyn Hooker performed a study that compared the happiness and well-adjusted nature of self-identified homosexual men with heterosexual men and found no difference. Her study stunned the medical community and made her a hero to many gay men and lesbians, but homosexuality remained in the DSM until 1973.|$|E

Sets of diagnostic criteria were outlined by Gillberg and Gillberg in 1989 and by Szatmari et al. in the same year. AS became a standard diagnosis in 1992, when it was included in the tenth edition of the World Health Organization's diagnostic manual, International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10); in 1994, it was added to the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic reference, <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV).|$|E

In the fifth edition of the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), published in May 2013, AS, as a separate diagnosis, was eliminated and folded into autism spectrum disorder.

50|$|There {{has been}} debate {{as to whether}} gender {{transition}} {{should be included in}} psychology.  “Gender transition processes are classified as mental disorders in diagnostic manuals” Suess also explains how stigmatizes trans people as mentally unwell, and incapable.

Sonny Nordmarken states that, “The idea that trans people are mentally ill is institutionalized in psychiatric texts such as the <b>Diagnostics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders and thus also in medical and legal transition routes” Sonny believes that when transgender people are placed in a psychology text, they are stigmatized as mentally ill, and thus increasing microaggressions and discrimination.  A study by Schilt and Wiswall showed that in a workplace environment transitioning trans men were supported in incorporating them more into society; whereas transitions trans women were demoted or fired. In the study microaggressions were noted by employers to transitioning trans women.|$|R

5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases of homosexual attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E
5|$|The National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS) and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA, {{now known}} as the Alzheimer's Association) {{established}} the most commonly used NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria for diagnosis in 1984, extensively updated in 2007. These criteria require that the presence of cognitive impairment, and a suspected dementia syndrome, be confirmed by neuropsychological testing for a clinical diagnosis of possible or probable AD. A histopathologic confirmation including a microscopic examination of brain tissue is required for a definitive diagnosis. Good statistical reliability and validity have been shown between the diagnostic criteria and definitive histopathological confirmation. Eight cognitive domains are most commonly impaired in AD—memory, language, perceptual skills, attention, constructive abilities, orientation, problem solving and functional abilities. These domains are equivalent to the NINCDS-ADRDA Alzheimer's Criteria as listed in the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) published by the American Psychiatric Association.|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim. Art {{therapy and}} {{drawings}} {{may serve as}} alternative means of expression and release from trauma among veterans diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Methods. The retrospective clinical study of drawings of war veterans was performed. A total of 89 war veterans met the <b>Diagnostics</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) PTSD criteria and were consecutively admitted to the Day Hospital during 5 years. Art group therapy as part of integrative treatment was performed once a week. The group was open and heterogeneous. Qualitative analysis of drawings content and group protocols were obtained. The drawings were made by free associations. War related themes were explored and descriptive statistics were applied. Results. The most frequent type of common themes of combat stress presented battle and witnessing wounded and killed combatants. Less frequent were themes of graves, destroyed cities and broken trees. The veterans preferred black and red colors with association to death, blood, wounds and destroyed objects. Conclusion. Drawing could provide a unique, complex, visual illustration of war traumatic experiences and memories of posttraumatic stress disorder veterans. Art group discussion might enhance war veterans’ verbal expression due to group support in safe setting.

40|$|The continual {{process of}} mental disease {{classification}} in U. S. psychiatry {{is assumed to}} reflect advancing professional knowledge of these disorders. To date, the American Psychiatric Association has developed four standard classifications, or nosologies, called <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manuals</b> ('DSMs'). DSM-I, the earliest, appeared in 1952 while the most recent, DSM-III-R, appeared in 1987. This paper employs a cultural constructivist perspective to deconstruct these nosologies and the classificatory process itself. Constructivism's premises, which emphasize culture, history, meaning and the constructed nature of medical phenomena, serve as the framework for the analysis. The paper shows that professional psychiatric classification expresses an underlying cultural psychology which encompasses four phenomenological domains and one of three Western person conceptions. Classifications {{are found to be}} explorations of culturally meaningful etiologies that explain the absence of 'self control', a central ethnopsychological aspect of the idealized self. Consideration of the vantage point of the voice of classification indicates that the ideal self is gender- (male), ethnic- (German Protestant) and age-specific (adult). The ethnic self's essence, and that of the Other, is believed to be biological, itself assumed to be natural and beyond culture or bias. Consequently, the ethnopsychology constructs as biologically caused the real and imagined differences in the gender, age or culturally Other. This invidious ethnobiological essentialism acts to create and maintain self-worth through a radical differentiation of self from those represented as Other. ethnopsychology psychiatric classification ethnopsychiatry United States medical anthropology...|$|R
40|$|M. A. There is a {{critical}} lack of local, clinical research into this growing problem which threatens to affect all of our lives, either directly or indirectly. The last government-sanctioned study on substance abuse in South Africa was conducted in 1970, and very limited research reports have been published that have reflected on the etiology, maintenance and treatment of the problem, either from a social or therapeutic perspective. This dissertation sets out to address the clinical, therapeutic issues of Substance Abuse disorder, including alcohol, within a South African context. The assumption of the author is that pathological personality styles and disorders underlie the problem of substance abuse in South Africa, as {{has been established in}} countries with similar substance abuse issues around the world. As will be seen in the following chapter, a distinct relationship has been established between the disorder of substance abuse, on Axis I and the personality disorders of Axis II, according to the DSM III-R. 4 A review of the literature will demonstrate the different findings surrounding this relationship, and describe the role that pathological personality patterns play in the development and maintenance of Substance Abuse disorder. These pathological personality styles and disorders are then discussed in detail, from the perspective of Millon's theory of personality. It is felt by this author that Millon's theory of personality provides a comprehensive framework for the discussion of the underlying personality issues associated with addiction. The extensive description of Millon's personality styles and disorders, their close association to the personality disorders described in the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manuals,</b> <b>and</b> their easy quantification through the MCMI II make Millon's theory, coupled with his test of personality the most well suited theory to form a foundation for the discussion and integration of an understanding of the problems associated with substance abuse in South Africa.

This evidence points toward diagnostic based frameworks for understanding and intervening in mental health difficulties being unable to either improve our scientific knowledge or improve outcomes in clinical practice and suggests that we need to move away from reliance on diagnostic based approaches for organising research and service delivery.

40|$|Animal cruelty is {{not only}} often a {{precursor}} to disruptive and delinquent behavior, it often co-occurs with the commission of family violence and other criminal behavior. The American Psychological Association, the National Crime Prevention Council, and the National School Safety Council cite animal cruelty {{as one of the}} warning signs for identifying at-risk youth. In 1987, the <b>Diagnostic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Statistical</b> Style <b>Manual</b> added animal cruelty as an indicator of the presence of conduct disorder in children. In recognition of this important link between animal cruelty and juvenile delinquency, 27 states have added statutory requirements for juveniles adjudicated for animal cruelty, or possibility of animal cruelty, to submit to psychological counseling. Despite this clear link between animal cruelty and youth violence, and the importance of accurately identifying risk factors that increase the likelihood of delinquent behavior, researchers and policy makers do not always grasp the utility of looking at animal cruelty as an important variable to consider. The development of disruptive and delinquent behavior takes place in a progressive fashion. Could the detection of animal cruelty generate earlier and more effective interventions and allow the research community to better understand the development of deviant behavior? This paper will assess the feasibility and usefulness of including animal cruelty as a variable in future research and practices, as well as make recommendations of how this can be accomplished. In addition, recommended policy changes will be discussed, including the practices of maintaining statistics on juvenile animal cruelty and the current proposal before the Federal Bureau of Investigation to add animal cruelty as a separate category in the agency’s crime data collection system...|$|R

We take a first step toward this goal by extending an existing autism ontology to allow automatic inference of ASD phenotypes <b>and</b> <b>Diagnostic</b> & <b>Statistical</b> <b>Manual</b> of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria based on subjects’ Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessment data. Materials <b>and</b> methodsKnowledge regarding <b>diagnostic</b> instruments, ASD phenotypes and risk factors was added to augment an existing autism ontology via Ontology Web Language class definitions and semantic web rules. We developed a custom Protégé plugin for enumerating combinatorial OWL axioms to support the many-to-many relations of ADI-R items to diagnostic categories in the DSM. We utilized a reasoner to infer whether 2642 subjects, whose data was obtained from the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, meet DSM-IV-TR (DSM-IV) <b>and</b> DSM- 5 <b>diagnostic</b> criteria based on their ADI-R data. ResultsWe extended the ontology by adding 443 classes and 632 rules that represent phenotypes, along with their synonyms, environmental risk factors, and frequency of comorbidities. Applying the rules on the data set showed that the method produced accurate results: the true positive and true negative rates for inferring autistic disorder diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria were 1 and 0. 065, respectively; the true positive rate for inferring ASD based on DSM- 5 criteria was 0. 94. DiscussionThe ontology allows automatic inference of subjects’ disease phenotypes and diagnosis with high accuracy. ConclusionThe ontology may benefit future studies by serving as a knowledge base for ASD. In addition, by adding knowledge of related NDDs, commonalities and differences in manifestations and risk factors could be automatically inferred, contributing to the understanding of ASD pathophysiology...|$|R
