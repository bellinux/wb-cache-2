Although he normally plays in a central role as a main striker, he is a versatile forward, who is capable of playing anywhere along the front line, and has also been deployed as a winger or as a second striker. Despite his talent, however, he has been criticized by managers, teammates, and the media for a perceived poor and immature attitude at times, as well as his for his poor movement and work-rate, inconsistency, mentality, and volatile temperament and arrogant behaviour on the pitch, which has often led him to pick up unnecessary bookings throughout his career. Balotelli has also been accused of diving, and is thus regarded by teammates and the media as a promising but undisciplined player. Due to his powerful shot, Balotelli is also a set-piece specialist, and is {{regarded as one of the}} best penalty kick takers in world football, a view backed by his former Manchester City goalkeeping teammate Joe Hart. Balotelli missed his first competitive penalty against Napoli on 22 September 2013 when it was saved by Pepe Reina; the first time in 22 attempts as a professional.|$|E

The image map was constructed from a mosaic of 69 Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) images and NOAA AVHRR data. The standard deviation in position in {{the central part of}} the mosaic is ± 125 m. Topographic-glaciologic features were taken from Landsat scenes and represent the best coastline of this region. Surface elevations have been calculated from airborne and ground measurements of either ice thickness (by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium) or barometric pressure. Accuracies vary from ± 2 to ± 7 m, Oversnow trigonometric levelling in the northeastern part of the ice shelf, tied to sea level at the ice front, has given accuracies of ± 1 m. Accuracies reduce to about ± 20 m in the grounded ice areas, ERS-I radar-altimeter data over the ice shelf have been processed to give ellipsoidal <b>heights</b> <b>elevation</b> above the ellipsoid), Geoidal reductions have been used to convert these to orthometric <b>heights</b> (<b>elevation</b> above sea level). No tidal corrections have been applied. The overall accuracy of the radar-altimeter-derived elevations is estimated to be better than ± 5 m.

50|$|A {{physically}} strong, tenacious, energetic, and hardworking box-to-box, central, or defensive midfielder, with a {{wide range}} of skills, Ambrosini was well regarded for his ability in the air, and was capable of being a goal-threat, in particular from set-pieces, due to his <b>height,</b> <b>elevation,</b> ability to make attacking runs into the area, and his heading accuracy, as well as his powerful striking ability from distance, which even led manager Carlo Ancelotti to deploy him as a centre forward on occasion. Throughout his career, he stood out for his leadership, as well as his stamina, versatility, tactical intelligence, and aggressive tackling. Although Ambrosini primarily served as a ball winner, he was also known for his ability to start attacking plays after winning back possession, courtesy of his vision and passing range, despite his lack of notable technical skills.

Box 800, Riyadh 11421, Saudi ArabiaThe Global Positioning System (GPS) {{relative}} {{carrier phase}} observations {{would provide a}} powerful and fast tool for obtaining an accurate relative three dimensional positioning of a point on the earth. However, the orthometric <b>heights</b> (<b>elevations</b> above geoid), which are the required values for most of surveying and engineering applications, are not directly provided by GPS observations. Instead, the ellipsoidal <b>heights</b> (<b>elevations</b> above ellipsoid) are derived from the processing of GPS observations. It follows that the separation between the ellipsoid and geoid (geoidal height) is an essential quantity in determining orthometric heights using GPS observations. This paper presents an accurate, relatively simple, and reliable technique to precisely model geoidal heights by combining both geopotential and regression surface fitting approaches utilizing least squaresmethodforeachone.. For {{the purpose of this}} proposed approach, a dense and small test network was designed. Both precise leveling and GPS observations were carried out and adjusted for common stations to establish precise vertical control network.

StratiWed random sampling {{was used to}} collect data on butterXy species richness from seventy-six 20 £ 50 m plots. The plant species richness and average vegetation height data were collected from 76 modiWed-Whittaker plots overlaid on 76 butterXy plots. Spatial heterogeneity around sample plots was quantiWed by measur-ing topographic variables and landscape metrics at eight spatial extents (radii of 300, 600 to 2, 400 m). The number of butterXy species recorded was strongly positively correlated with plant species richness, proportion of shrubland and mean patch size of shrubland. Patterns in butterXy species richness were negatively correlated with other variables including mean patch size, average vegetation <b>height,</b> <b>elevation,</b> and range in NDVI. The best predictive model selected using Akaike’s Information Criterion corrected for small sample size (AICc), explained 62 % of the variation in butterXy species richness at the 2, 100 m spatial extent.

40|$|As an {{intermediate}} step between raw remote sensing data and digital urban maps, remote sensing data classification {{has been a}} challenging and long-standing research problem {{in the community of}} remote sensing. In this work, an effective classification method is proposed for classifying high-resolution remote sensing data over urban areas. Starting from high resolution multi-spectral images and 3 D geometry data, our method proceeds in three main stages: feature extraction, classification, and classified result refinement. First, we extract color, vegetation index and texture features from the multi-spectral image and compute the <b>height,</b> <b>elevation</b> texture and differential morphological profile (DMP) features from the 3 D geometry data. Then in the classification stage, multiple random forest (RF) classifiers are trained separately, then combined to form a RF ensemble to estimate each sample’s category probabilities. Finally the probabilities along with the feature importance indicator outputted by RF ensemble are used to construct a fully connected conditional random field (FCCRF) graph model, by which the classification results are refined through mean-field based statistical inference. Experiments on the ISPRS Semantic Labeling Contest dataset show that our proposed 3 -stage method achieves 86. 9 % overall accuracy on the test data...|$|E
