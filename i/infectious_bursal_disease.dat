In recent years, very virulent strains of IBDV (vvIBDV), causing severe mortality in chicken, have emerged in Europe, Latin America, South-East Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Infection is via the oro-fecal route, with affected bird excreting high levels of the virus for approximately 2 weeks after infection.|$|E

The results indicated that rchIL- 12 alone or rchIL- 12 plus mineral oil (MO) co-administered with rVP 2 antigen significantly enhanced the production of serum neutralization (SN) antibody against IBDV, compared to those with MO alone. The SN titers in groups receiving rVP 2 antigen with MO alone were more inconsistent after vaccination. On the other hand, rchIL- 12 significantly stimulated IFN-gamma production in serum and in splenocyte cultured supernatant, suggesting that rchIL- 12 alone or plus MO significantly induced a cell-mediated immune response. Finally, bursal lesion protection from very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) challenge in chickens receiving rVP 2 antigen with rchIL- 12 alone or plus MO was much more effective than that with MO alone at two weeks after boosting. Taken together, rchIL- 12 alone augmented in vivo the induction of a primary and also a secondary SN antibody production and a cell-mediated immunity against IBDV rVP 2 antigen, which conferred the enhancement of bursal lesion protective efficacy from vvIBDV challenge. These data indicated that a potential for chIL- 12 as immunoadjuvant for chicken vaccine development such as IBDV rVP 2 antigen. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

One hundred and forty four day-old Ross male broiler chicks {{were randomly assigned to}} three dietary treatments: a basal diet (control), a basal diet with 0. 15 % Fermacto and basal diet with 0. 30 % Fermacto. The production parameters, including Feed Intake (FI), Body Weight Gain (BWG) and Feed to Gain Ratio (FCR) were monitored weekly serum lipids, antibody productions and antibody titer against <b>Infectious</b> <b>Bursal</b> Virus <b>Disease</b> (IBVD) were measured {{at the end of a}} 6 week trial. At 28 days of age, four birds from each replicate of treatments were injected intrabreast with 0. 2 mL of 5 % Sheep Red Blood Cell (SRBC). The supplementation of 0. 30 % Fermacto in broiler diets improved the body weight gain from 21 - 28 and 35 - 42 days of age (p< 0. 05). The BWG was also significantly higher (p< 0. 01) in Fermacto-fed broilers than that of control treatment at 28 - 35 days of age, overall growing (21 - 42 day) and rearing (0 - 42 day) periods. FI was significantly (p< 0. 05) higher for 0. 15 % Fermacto-fed broilers than that of control broilers at 14 - 21 and 0 - 21 days of age.

40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundThe {{majority}} of chickens in sub-Saharan Africa are indigenous ecotypes, well {{adapted to the}} local environment and raised in scavenging production systems. Although they are generally resilient to disease challenge, routine vaccination and biosecurity measures are rarely applied and infectious diseases remain {{a major cause of}} mortality and reduced productivity. Management and genetic improvement programmes are hampered by lack of routine data recording. Selective breeding based on genomic technologies may provide the means to enhance sustainability. In this study, we investigated the genetic architecture of antibody response to four major <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> [infectious <b>bursal</b> <b>disease</b> (IBDV), Marek’s disease (MDV), fowl typhoid (SG), fowl cholera (PM) ] and resistance to Eimeria and cestode parasitism, along with two production traits [body weight and body condition score (BCS) ] in two distinct indigenous Ethiopian chicken ecotypes. We conducted variance component analyses, genome-wide association studies, and pathway and selective sweep analyses. ResultsThe large {{majority of}} birds was found to have antibody titres for all pathogens and were infected with both parasites, suggesting almost universal exposure. We derived significant moderate to high heritabilities for IBDV, MDV and PM antibody titres, cestodes infestation, body weight and BCS. We identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with genome-wide significance for each trait. Based on these associations, we identified for each trait, pathways, networks and functional gene clusters that include plausible candidate genes. Selective sweep analyses revealed a locus on chromosome 18 associated with viral antibody titres and resistance to Eimeria parasitism that is within a positive selection signal. We found no significant genetic correlations between production, immune and disease traits, implying that selection for altered antibody response and/or disease resistance will not affect production. ConclusionsWe confirmed the presence of genetic variability and identified SNPs significantly associated with immune, disease and production traits in indigenous village chickens.

IBDV is a bi-segmented double stranded RNA virus. The smaller ORF of larger RNA segment encodes VP 5, a 17 -kDa non-structural protein. Although {{it is an}} important protein for viral replication cycle, the definition of its specific role and subcellular localization remains unclear. In the present work we demonstrate, using imaging techniques, that VP 5 is not a type II transmembrane protein but an intracellular membrane-associated protein.

5000|$|In an {{attenuated}} vaccine, live virus or bacteria {{with very}} low virulence are administered. They will replicate, but locally or very slowly. Since they do reproduce {{and continue to}} present antigen to the immune system beyond the initial vaccination, boosters may be required less often. These vaccines may be produced by passaging, for example, adapting a virus into different host cell cultures, such as in animals, or at suboptimal temperatures, allowing selection of less virulent strains, or by mutagenesis or targeted deletions in genes required for virulence. There is a small risk of reversion to virulence, which is smaller in vaccines with deletions. Attenuated vaccines also cannot be used by immunocompromised individuals. Reversions of virulence were described for a few attenuated viruses of chickens (<b>infectious</b> <b>bursal</b> <b>disease</b> virus, avian infectious bronchitis virus, avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.03_AVIAN_INF_LARYNGO.pdf, avian metapneumovirus http://www.oie.int/fileadmin/Home/eng/Health_standards/tahm/2.03.15_TURKEY_RHINO.pdf) ...|$|E
5000|$|Risk {{factors that}} have been {{identified}} as increasing vent pecking include dim lights placed in nest boxes to encourage hens to use the boxes, the diet being changed more than three times during the egg laying period, the use of bell drinkers, and the hens beginning to lay earlier than 20 weeks of age. [...] Vent pecking is associated with indicators of stress, e.g. fluctuating asymmetry, heterophil to lymphocyte ratio, and tonic immobility duration. [...] Vent pecking can be related to disease or immune challenge as it sometimes becomes prevalent in cases of Gumboro disease (<b>Infectious</b> <b>Bursal</b> <b>Disease)</b> and is increased by challenges with the protein antigen, human serum albumin (HuSA). [...] Housing design can influence vent pecking. Mortality caused by cannibalism was reduced when hens had sufficient room to perch all facing the feed trough, thus giving their perch-mates little opportunity to peck at the vent region [...] and increased pecking activity and cannibalistic behaviour can occur due to inadequate height of the perches. [...] Larger group sizes lead to increases in vent pecking suggesting that social learning plays a role.|$|E
50|$|<b>Infectious</b> <b>bursal</b> <b>disease</b> virus (IBDV) is the best-characterized {{member of}} the family Birnaviridae. These viruses have bipartite dsRNA genomes {{enclosed}} in single layered icosahedral capsids with T = 13l geometry. IBDV shares functional strategies and structural features with many other icosahedral dsRNA viruses, except that it lacks the T = 1 (or pseudo T = 2) core common to the Reoviridae, Cystoviridae, and Totiviridae. The IBDV capsid protein exhibits structural domains that show homology to those of the capsid proteins of some positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, such as the nodaviruses and tetraviruses, as well as the T = 13 capsid shell protein of the Reoviridae. The T = 13 shell of the IBDV capsid is formed by trimers of VP2, a protein generated by removal of the C-terminal domain from its precursor, pVP2. The trimming of pVP2 is performed on immature particles as part of the maturation process. The other major structural protein, VP3, is a multifunctional component lying under the T = 13 shell that influences the inherent structural polymorphism of pVP2. The virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, VP1, is incorporated into the capsid through its association with VP3. VP3 also interacts extensively with the viral dsRNA genome.|$|E

In this trial we investigated the effects of the vaccine against infective <b>bursal</b> <b>disease</b> (IBD) on occurrence and clinical manifestation of campylobacteriosis in conditions of controlled experimental infection with the strain Campylobacter jejuni. The immunosuppressive effects of a live attenuated vaccine against IBD on development of clinically manifest campylobacteriosis in perorally challenged chickens were assessed. The investigation was performed on 90 chickens in experimental conditions. The presence of Campylobacter jejuni was confirmed by reisolation, while identification of the organism was performed on the basis of its morphological, cultural and biochemical characteristics. Specific antibody titer and humoral immune response to C. jejuni specific antibodies were monitored using the complement fixation reaction method.
