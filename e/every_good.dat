25|$|The most {{dramatic}} festivals can be witnessed during the Mal ay Aldo, {{which is the}} Kapampangan expression of the Holy Week. These include the erection of a temporary shrine known as the puni where the pasion or the story of Christ's suffering is chanted in archaic Kapampangan. The melody of the Kapampangan pasion {{was said to have}} been taken from their traditional epic, whose original words were lost and replaced by the story of Christ. The highlight of the Mal ay Aldo celebration is the procession of the magdarame or sasalibatbat penitents covered in blood from self-flagellation.

Rolando del Campo, a carpenter in Pampanga, vowed to be crucified <b>every</b> <b>Good</b> Friday for 15 years if God would carry his wife through a difficult childbirth, while in San Pedro Cutud, Ruben Enaje has been crucified 27 times. The Church in the Philippines has repeatedly voiced disapproval of crucifixions and self-flagellation, while the government has noted that it cannot deter devotees. The Department of Health insists that participants in the rites should have tetanus shots and that the nails used should be sterilized.|$|E

She was formally greeted by Jimmy Walker, the serving Mayor of New York City. Constance Lily Morris, author of On Tour with Queen Marie, {{wrote that the}} people were excited for Marie's arrival mainly because of her almost mythical allure, which had been created by papers and rumour throughout her life; she observed that [...] "the modest Queen of the Belgians [...] had once come with her king for a brief visit and years ago the dusky Hawaiian ruler had honored us, {{but there had been}} no others. The time could not have been better set." [...] Marie was also fairly popular within suffragette circles, where she was viewed as [...] "a woman whose wits had devised many a coup d'état, whose brains had thought out many a difficult problem for her people, who had used the gifts given her to further <b>every</b> <b>good</b> purpose".|$|E
500|$|Aside from politics, Kaʻauwai was a {{successful}} entrepreneur and {{was regarded as a}} [...] "man of wealth". He acquired and accumulated extensive property in Honolulu and Maui, and according to Reverend Armstrong, who was pastor at Kawaiahaʻo Church and knew him in later life, stated [...] "He did accumulate property; he had lands, houses, cattle, and money. But he did not hoard these fruits of his industry—he gave freely to aid in <b>every</b> <b>good</b> work; gave for the support of the Gospel; aided in building meeting houses and school houses; in sending the Gospel to the heathen, and in assisting the needy.” On March 1849, he attempted to purchase the island of Kahoʻolawe from the King and the Land Commission. Kaʻauwai offered $400 for the entire island, which had been previously used unsuccessfully as a male penal colony. The offer was refused by the King and his Privy Council of State, and a subsequent application dated to August 18, 1854 for a fifty-year lease at $200 per year was also declined. He also worked as a farmer and acquired property on Maui for growing taro and banana, which he won prizes for at the Hawaiian Agricultural Society in 1851.|$|E
500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a jug of wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs.

[...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me <b>every</b> <b>good</b> thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
