25|$|In the 19th century, {{mathematics}} became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract.</b> Concerns about logical {{gaps and}} inconsistencies in different fields {{led to the}} development of axiomatic systems.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{influenced}} by realists such as James Ensor, she later adopted a geometric style of landscape painting, which became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract,</b> inviting comparisons with Paul Klee.|$|R
5000|$|His plastic production, <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> {{from the}} 60's, is {{characterized}} by a concern with [...] "rhythm, color and shape", as Barros himself developed in many of his artistic essays.|$|R
50|$|Characteristic of his era, George Aarons {{was among}} the {{foreign-born}} American sculptors of the early 20th century who started their careers as academicians and evolved into modernists and <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> artists.|$|R
50|$|After {{studying}} at the Slade School of Fine Art, Potter began her career, exhibiting in London {{by the early}} 1920s. From the 1950s, her work became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract,</b> and she gained wider notice.|$|R
50|$|After this period, Dahm's work took an {{inspired}} religious turn, becoming occupied with imagery including expressionistic interpretations of paradise, the Pietà, the crucifixion of Christ and angels. After this period her work became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract.</b>|$|R
5000|$|With mythic form as a catalyst, they merged the two European {{styles of}} Surrealism and abstraction. As a result, Rothko’s work became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract.</b> Perhaps ironically, Rothko himself {{described}} {{the process as}} being one toward [...] "clarity".|$|R
50|$|In 1950 {{the family}} moved to Auckland and she {{attended}} the Elam School of Art but was frustrated by its conservatism. She continued to work in John Weeks studio, however and her work of this period becomes <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> and intellectual.|$|R
40|$|Security {{is among}} the most {{successful}} applications of aspectoriented concepts. In particular, in role-based access control, aspects capture access conditions in a quite modular way. The question we address in this paper is how can aspects be generated from access control policies under a validated process? We present a metamodel-based transformation from SecureUML, a rolebased access control language, to an <b>abstract</b> <b>aspect</b> language. Within this model-driven engineering context, a security policy is represented as an instance of SecureUML’s metamodel and the generated aspect is represented as an instance of the <b>abstract</b> <b>aspect</b> language metamodel. Invariants specified on the merged metamodel of SecureUML and the <b>abstract</b> <b>aspect</b> language are checked to validate the generated aspect with respect to the given security policy. We have prototyped our approach as a Java application on top of IT-P/OCL, a rewriting-based OCL evaluator. It outputs validated AspectJ code from a SecureUML policy...|$|R

25|$|While Callahan {{enjoyed his}} status as a {{respected}} artist, the <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> style of his painting did not lend itself to ready sales. He supplemented his income with occasional teaching jobs at various colleges, and in 1954 applied for and received a Guggenheim Fellowship.|$|R
5000|$|Burns {{usually takes}} {{photographs}} {{of his subjects}} before working on their portraits. The painter notes, however, that [...] "each of the various pictorial elements also contains a deeper symbolic meaning... My goal is realism, but it’s by <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> means that realism is attained.".|$|R
50|$|When {{he retired}} from Consular duties in 1958, he was then free to give all of his time to his art, which flourished both in quality and success. At about the same time, his work became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> and {{remained}} so during his lifetime.|$|R

50|$|In 1950, he met Joe Morgan, {{architect}} for the Marriott Corporation, {{based in}} Washington. The Marriott hotel chain was planning free-standing restaurants called the Hot Shoppes. Morgan commissioned Bookatz to create murals for all eight restaurants. The figurative expressionist scenes involved modern flower gardens with figures entwined. He also worked on <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> architectural details for temples, office buildings, and later frescoes for eight elder housing buildings by D.C. developer Joseph Della Ratta. In 1962 he developed, via {{a grant from}} the Ford Foundation, set designs for the D.C. Arena Stage. The <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> styles of painting can be seen in his works acquired by such friends as military man Jack Gross, whose art estate was bequeathed to the Harrisburg Art Association, and Pearl S. Buck.|$|R

5000|$|After World War II, {{his work}} was <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract.</b> In 1950 he became {{associated}} with Lucio Fontana and the Spazialismo movement. From the 1950s onward he produced thematic cycles of paintings, such as Tumulti ("Riots"), Prigioniera ("Prisoner"), Grandi Occhi ("Big Eyes"), Cielo ("Sky"), and Figure agitate ("Agitated Figures").|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s to early 1950s, the {{influence}} of Diego Rivera {{is evident in the}} earthy textures and colors, {{as well as in the}} heavy, sculpted, quasi-cubist forms of her <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> paintings (see right). Meanwhile, the scale of her work increased, also as a result of her study with Rivera.|$|R
50|$|Kiesler’s Endless House was {{intended}} to communicate his personal views of metaphysics. In terms of architecture, he included <b>abstract</b> <b>aspects</b> of ‘connectivity’, ‘corealation’, and ‘biotechnique’. These terms describe abstract ideas, rather than being specific architectural terms.|$|R

25|$|Léger's paintings, {{from then}} until 1914, became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract.</b> Their tubular, conical, and cubed forms are laconically {{rendered}} in rough patches of primary colors plus green, black and white, {{as seen in}} the series of paintings with the title Contrasting Forms. Léger made no use of the collage technique pioneered by Braque and Picasso.|$|R
50|$|Another primary {{exploration}} of Zittel’s {{is around the}} concept of panels, or planes—the basic elements of our surrounding reality. With <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> and large-scale works--Personal Panel Uniforms (1995-1998), Carpet Furniture, Parallel Planar Panels, Planar Pavilions, Planar Configurations, and Linear Sequences--Zittel questions preconceptions regarding the functional, psychological, and even spiritual meanings of horizontality and verticality.|$|R

5000|$|He {{had begun}} by {{painting}} {{works with a}} mythological or literary basis, but later came to favor street scenes and views of Copenhagen harbor. He would often paint several {{versions of the same}} concept. Due to his intense self-criticism, many of these would end up in the fire. Over the years, his works became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract.</b>|$|R
5000|$|William Townsend {{told the}} Tate Gallery that 'the style {{originated}} with Geoffrey Tibble {{in the latter}} half of 1933. It was immediately taken up by Rodrigo Moynihan ... and at the same time or shortly after by Edgar Hubert'. According to Townsend, early paintings by the group were derived from external objects but they became <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract.</b>|$|R
50|$|Option spreads {{are formed}} with {{different}} option contracts {{on the same}} underlying stock or commodity. There are {{many different types of}} named option spreads, each pricing a different <b>abstract</b> <b>aspect</b> of the price of the underlying, leading to complex arbitrage attempts.|$|R
50|$|The {{powerful}} {{nature of}} the Faroes, which makes an immediate visual impact on any painter, is the all-embracing theme in Reyni's art. But he experiences nature from the inside, as structures, tones, and fragments of a universe offering opportunities for graphical treatment of form and movement, light colours and rhythms. The expressions of nature become {{the basis of an}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> idiom.|$|R
5000|$|Ginastera grouped {{his music}} into three periods: [...] "Objective Nationalism" [...] (1934-1948), [...] "Subjective Nationalism" [...] (1948-1958), and [...] "Neo-Expressionism" [...] (1958-1983). Among other {{distinguishing}} features, these periods {{vary in their}} use of traditional Argentine musical elements. His Objective Nationalistic works often integrate Argentine folk themes in a straightforward fashion, while works in the later periods incorporate traditional elements in <b>increasingly</b> <b>abstracted</b> forms.|$|R

50|$|The human {{condition}} {{is the main}} concern of the painter manifested in his early works by the alienated individual within the city. Later the city, specifically Varanasi with its dilapidated, crammed houses, conveys a sense of hopelessness. <b>Increasingly</b> <b>abstract</b> works done in sweeping strokes of paint evoke both exultation of natural spaces and more recently an incipient violence within human habitation.|$|R
