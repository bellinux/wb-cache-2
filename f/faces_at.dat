5|$|Sable briefly {{became a}} face again when she {{appeared}} {{on the cover of}} Playboy magazine (March 2004 issue) {{for the third time in}} her career. On the cover, she appeared with fellow diva Torrie Wilson, making them the first WWE Divas to pose in Playboy together. Surrounding the release of the cover, the duo feuded with Raw divas Stacy Keibler and Miss Jackie, even though all four women were <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> the time. The two teams squared off at WrestleMania XX in an Interpromotional Tag Team Evening Gown match, but the divas started the match in their underwear, making it more of a lingerie match. Sable and Wilson were victorious. The change was rumored to have occurred because Sable had suffered damage to her Breast Implants while Weightlifting.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} is triggered when Detective Jimmy McNulty meets privately with Judge Daniel Phelan following the acquittal of D'Angelo Barksdale for murder after a key witness changes her story. McNulty tells Phelan that the witness {{has probably been}} intimidated by members of a drug trafficking empire run by D'Angelo's uncle, Avon Barksdale, having recognized several <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> the trial, most notably Avon's second-in-command, Stringer Bell. He also tells Phelan {{that no one is}} investigating Barksdale's criminal activity, which includes {{a significant portion of the}} city's drug trade and several unsolved homicides.|$|E

25|$|Square faces: Each vertex of {{a square}} is 90°, {{so there is}} only one {{arrangement}} possible with three <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> a vertex, the cube.|$|E
25|$|These dual tilings {{are listed}} by their face configuration, {{the number of}} <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> each vertex of a face. For example V4.8.8 means {{isosceles}} triangle tiles with one corner with four triangles, and two corners containing eight triangles.|$|E
25|$|Some regular polyhedra and tilings (those with an {{even number}} of <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> each vertex) can also be {{considered}} quasiregular by differentiating between faces of the same number of sides, but representing them differently, like having different colors, but no surface features defining their orientation. A regular figure with Schläfli symbol {p,q} can be quasiregular, with vertex configuration (p.p)q/2, if q is even.|$|E

25|$|Of the Johnson solids, the {{elongated}} square gyrobicupola (J37), {{also called}} the pseudorhombicuboctahedron, is unique in being locally vertex-uniform: there are 4 <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> each vertex, and their arrangement is always the same: 3 squares and 1 triangle. However, it is not vertex-transitive, as it has different isometry at different vertices, making it a Johnson solid rather than an Archimedean solid.|$|E
25|$|The VCU men's {{track team}} won the 2006 CAA Conference Championship after placing second in the CAA's in the {{previous}} 2 years. The team was led by Davion Lambert and James Frerson who were named the Field MVP and Track MVP respectively. The team is looking to be led to another CAA victory with some old and new <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> the CAA Championships this year.|$|E
25|$|Johannes Kepler in Harmonices Mundi (1618) named this {{polyhedron}} a rhombicuboctahedron, being {{short for}} truncated cuboctahedral rhombus, with cuboctahedral rhombus being his {{name for a}} rhombic dodecahedron. This truncation creates new vertices mid-edge to the rhombic dodecahedron, creating rectangular faces inside the original rhombic faces, and new square and triangle <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> the original vertices. The semiregular form here requires the geometry be adjusted so the rectangles become squares.|$|E

25|$|Suladân, the Serpent Lord – In truth, Suladan's name {{passed out}} of use long ago {{when he took the}} name of a revered hero at the time he claimed {{leadership}} of his tribe. Since then the name of the Serpent Lord has once more become a famous one throughout Harad, and his own legend grows with each victory. A Haradrim chief analogous to one whom Théoden <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. Tolkien left him unnamed; his name and title are invented by Games Workshop although his name is likely an altered form of Saladin; the Muslim leader during the Third Crusade.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} built in red {{sandstone}} with a slate roof. Its plan {{consists of a}} west tower, a five-bay nave with a clerestory, north and south aisles, a south transept, north and south porches, and a chancel which is narrower and less lofty than the nave. The north aisle is almost fully occupied by the Bold chapel. To {{the north of the}} chancel are two vestries. The tower has corner buttresses, a curvilinear west window and smaller louvred windows on all <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> the bell-stage. A clock face is on the south side. The clerestory windows are pitched dormers. The tower, chancel and transept are crenellated and the chancel has crocketted finials.|$|E
25|$|Paxton set the {{dimensions}} of this prism by using the length of {{single pane of glass}} (49 inches) as the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, thereby creating a triangle with a length-to-height ratio of 2.5:1, whose base (adjacent side) was 4 feet long. By mirroring this triangle he obtained the 8-foot-wide gables that formed the vertical <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> either end of the prism, each of which was 24' long. With this arrangement, Paxton could glaze the entire roof surface with identical panes that {{did not need to be}} trimmed. Paxton placed three of these 8' x 24' roof units side-by-side, horizontally supported by a grid of cast iron beams, which was held up on slim cast iron pillars. The resulting cube, with a floor area of 24'x 24', formed the basic structural module of the building.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{provides}} legal representation, legal advice, {{and help}} in covering court costs in civil cases {{to those who}} cannot raise the necessary funds to hire an attorney, but only {{when there is a}} reasonable chance of success. In criminal cases where the defendant <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> least one year of imprisonment, the defendant has the right to legal counsel. Although there is a right to legal defense, there is no organized public defender system. Instead, any lawyer can be appointed to provide counsel to a specific defendant, and the defendant can select a specific lawyer. Questions of payment are deferred until the end of a trial, and the court will decide the cost of the case to the losing party. The defendant will not be charged for legal services if acquitted. If convicted, the defendant will be required to pay the lawyer's expenses unless the court finds that the defendant is indigent.|$|E
25|$|A {{poll by the}} London Evening Standard in December 2007, which {{surveyed}} a {{range of}} the capital's communities, including Muslims, found that 49% of those surveyed considered Islam as generally intolerant, while 44% saw it as generally tolerant. A total of 51% felt that Muslims were isolated from other communities to a degree, with 12% believing {{that the majority of}} them were. A large majority (81% to 7%), believed that the most holy day in Islam, Eid, should not be celebrated by the British state, and 88% opposed Muslim teachers covering their <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> work. A majority (55%) wanted immigration of Muslims to be cut, with 33% wanting it cut greatly. Islam was seen as the cause of the 7 July attacks on the city in 2005 by 52% of the population, with 35% seeing it as a major factor. Views from the survey which were not in line with the largely negative views included that 71% would vote for a Muslim Mayor of London if they were the best candidate (with 16% against such a vote).|$|E
25|$|Nicholson {{approached}} {{the problem by}} constructing a development of the intrados of the arch from the plan and elevation drawings, effectively unrolling and flattening the surface, then drawing the courses perpendicular to the faces, adding the header joints perpendicular to the courses, then finally rolling up the development diagram by projecting the detail of the intrados back onto the plan and elevation drawings, a technique also used by others who would later offer alternative solutions to the problem. This method resulted in the courses of stone voussoirs making up {{the barrel of the}} skew arch following parallel helical paths between the abutments, giving the view along the barrel an attractive rifled appearance. Although these courses meet the arch <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> right angles at the crown of the arch, the nearer they are to the springing line the greater their deviation from perpendicularity. Thus Nicholson's method is not the perfect solution, but it is a workable one that has one great advantage over more purist alternatives, namely that since the helical courses run parallel to each other, all the voussoir stones can be cut to the same pattern, the only exceptions being the ring stones, or quoins, where the barrel meets the faces of the arch, each of which is unique but has an identical copy in the other face.|$|E

500|$|The revolutionary <b>faces</b> <b>at</b> {{least two}} special problems. First, the {{transformation}} back into naked power occurs when revolutionary {{power has been}} around for a long period without achieving a resolution to its key conflict. At some point, the original goal of the creed tends to be forgotten, and consequently, the fanatics of the movement change their goals and aspire toward mere domination (Russell 1938:92). Second, the revolutionary must always deal with the threat of counter-revolutionaries, and is hence faced with a dilemma: because revolutionary power must by definition think that the original revolution was justified, it [...] "cannot, logically, contend that all subsequent revolutions must be wicked" [...] (Russell 1938:87).|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} her A-levels, Ripley sought {{entry to}} the Guildhall School of Music and Drama.
