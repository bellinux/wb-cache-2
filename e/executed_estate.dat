Kenilworth became the primary castle of the Lancaster estates, {{replacing}} Bolingbroke, and acted as both a social and a financial centre for Thomas. Thomas built the first great hall at the castle from 1314 to 1317 and constructed the Water Tower along the outer bailey, as well as increasing {{the size of the}} chase. Lancaster, with support from many of the other English barons, found himself in increasing opposition to Edward II. War broke out in 1322, and Lancaster was captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge and <b>executed.</b> His <b>estates,</b> including Kenilworth, were confiscated by the crown.

On 5 November 1785, the Estate of Dunardry was advertised for sale by public auction in December after Lachlan had fallen into {{financial}} trouble, partly due to judgement debts against him. At least two decisions by the Court of Session in Edinburgh arose from his father’s lead role in failing to account for, and to properly <b>execute,</b> the <b>estate</b> of Duncan Campbell of Kilduskland {{who had died in}} 1766. A [...] "considerable sum" [...] (£400 Sterling plus interest) was due to Elizabeth MacDonald of Largie, [...] Kilduskland’s niece, and £2,000 including interest to Ronald Campbell, Kilduskland’s nephew, by 1780. [...] Lachlan’s portion of these two debts alone amounted to four times the annual income from the Dunardry lands (£392) as stated in the advertisement of 1785.

50|$|The first {{historical}} {{details of}} the manor were recorded in the Domesday book which stated that before the Norman conquest the manor was owned by a Saxon lord known as Alward. There were 3 hides of land but Alward had paid tax only for 2 hides. There was land for 16 ploughs of which 5 were owned by the lord who had 7 serfs. 15 villeins and 25 smallholders held {{the rest of the}} land and had 8 ploughs. There was 60 acre of woodland and 300 acre of pasture. The livestock was 4 wild mares, 10 cattle and 180 sheep. The annual value was £20 but it had formerly paid £8. Following the conquest lordship of the manor passed to Robert, Count of Mortain, the half brother of William the Conqueror. In 1230 the manor was granted by Richard, 1st Earl of Cornwall (younger brother of King Henry III) to Henry le Tyes. The manor remained the property of the Le Tyes family until 1322 when Henry Lord Tyes took part in the revolt against King Edward II and was <b>executed,</b> his <b>estate</b> passing to his sister Alice Lisle.|$|R

King Charles wrote to Sir John informing him of his intentions to join his son James, Duke of York who was residing in Hull. After holding a meeting in Ye Olde White Hart Inn on 23 April 1642 it was decided by majority vote that {{the gates of the}} city would be closed to the king. The king was furious and Sir John was dubbed a traitor. A siege of Hull by the king lasted for three weeks and although Sir John escaped to his manor at Scorborough he was arrested and taken to the Tower of London. The House of Commons ordered that money, plots of land and the goods belonging to Sir John be seized. In December 1644 he was tried and condemned to execution. Sir John's son, Captain Hotham, was also deemed guilty and <b>executed.</b> The <b>estate</b> was left to Captain Hotham's only son, also called John, aged 13. Like his grandfather, John became an MP for the local town of Beverley and went into exile in 1684 after the exclusion crisis. He returned with William of Orange in 1688 and was appointed the Governor of Hull in 1689. He died that year after becoming ill with a [...] "chill" [...] while travelling from Hull to Beverley.

50|$|The Middleton Baronetcy, of Belsay Castle in the County of Northumberland, {{was created}} in the Baronetage of England on 24 October 1662 for William Middleton, of Belsay Castle, Belsay, Northumberland. The Middletons were descended from Richard Middleton who was Chancellor to Henry III. His {{grandson}} Sir Gilbert Middleton took part in a rebellion against Edward II. He was captured and <b>executed.</b> The Middleton <b>estates</b> including Belsay were forfeited to the Crown but were restored to the family by marriage in the reign of Edward III. Sir John Middleton was a fervent Yorkist in the 15th century and fought at the Battles of St Albans in 1455 and Bosworth in 1485. The third, fifth and sixth Baronets all sat as Member of Parliament for Northumberland. The sixth Baronet assumed in 1799 by Royal sign-manual the surname of Monck in lieu of his patronymic, according to the will of his maternal grandfather Lawrence Monck. The seventh Baronet, who represented Durham in Parliament, resumed the use of the surname of Middleton. The title became extinct on the death of the tenth Baronet in 1999. The Middleton family and estate records are held in the archives of the Northumberland Record Office.|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{real estate}} is an {{important}} asset class {{but it does not}} yet have a well-developed derivatives market in the United States. A derivative is a contract that derives its value from an underlying index or asset. Examples of the most well-known derivatives that have been widely used and traded for years are stock options, commodity futures and interest rate swaps. The advent of direct real estate equity derivative products has created the opportunity for similar applications in both the US and international commercial real estate markets. The United States is currently experiencing a convergence between real estate and finance and it appears that the real estate derivatives market might be ready to take off. The use of derivatives could improve the functioning of the real estate industry by allowing investors to gain or reduce exposure to the commercial real estate asset class without directly buying or selling properties. The increased liquidity and reduced up front capital requirements provide added flexibility in <b>executing</b> real <b>estate</b> investment strategies (i. e. speculating) and managing risk (i. e. hedging). This has resulted in significant interest in the development of commercial property derivatives by key players in all sectors. A number of barriers (e. g., indices, pricing, education, fund mandates, tax and accounting treatment) still exist that hinder the successful implementation and growth of real estate derivatives in the US commercial real estate market. It is crucial for the market to overcome these barriers in order to revolutionize the institutional world and allow investors to gain exposure to the real estate asset class and to hedge private real estate risk. This thesis analyzes these barriers {{to the development of a}} synthetic market that is on the brink of expanding. (cont.) The US real estate sector is an eight trillion dollar market composed of real estate assets which has been managed until recently without pointed focus on the property specific risk. The size of this market presents a vast opportunity for risk hedging, asset allocation and portfolio rebalancing in a more efficient manner through the use of derivatives. by Jani Venter. Thesis (S.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the materials in this collection consist of original and some published documents pertaining to the Berlin physician Curt Bejach and his family. Also included are original correspondence and published articles about the physicist Samuel Goudsmit. Curt Dietrich Bejach (1890 - 1944) earned his medical degree at the University in Königsberg and worked in Berlin, where he held a teaching position at Soziale Frauenschule der Inneren Mission, a college that prepared women for jobs in social services. He was dismissed from his job in 1933 and was eventually deported to the concentration camp Theresienstadt and ultimately to Auschwitz, where he perished in 1944. The physicist Samuel Goudsmit was born 1902 in The Hague. In 1925, {{when he was a}} graduate student at the University of Leyden, he discovered the electron’s spin together with George E. Uhlenbeck. He immigrated to the United States in 1927, working as scientific director of the Alsos mission, investigating the German nuclear energy project.

40|$|Intestacy {{statutes}} seek {{to further}} donative freedom by effectuating the attributed intent {{of those who}} fail to <b>execute</b> a valid <b>estate</b> plan during life. One might reasonably hypothesize that gay men and lesbians, on the whole, differ from the non-gay majority {{with respect to their}} donative intent. The fundamental difference in romantic and affectional preferences between gay people and non-gay people is likely to produce such a disparate donative intent. Much anecdotal evidence and recent empirical evidence strongly support this hypothesis. Article II of the Uniform Probate Code presently ignores the existence of gay men and lesbians, despite the drafters 2 ̆ 7 expressed effort to recognize the changing nature of the American family. Article II would better implement its principal goal of promoting donative freedom, however, if its intestacy provisions were redrafted to implement the attributed intent of gay men and lesbians. Such inclusion could be implemented consistent with the 1990 Code 2 ̆ 7 s desire for simplicity and certainty in succession law by utilizing a registration system for qualification of committed partners, a multi-factor approach that limits judicial discretion through objective requirements and clearly delineated factors for qualification or a combination of these two systems. Succession reform to include same-sex committed partners also would remove the badge of inferiority that Article II presently places on gay men and lesbians and their relationships. By failing to recognize the fundamental difference between gay people and non-gay people with respect to donative preferences, Article II implies that gay and lesbian relationships are insignificant or unsuitable for recognition. This implicit expression is made all the more pronounced in light of the lack of any justification for same-sex exclusion deriving from the principles of succession law on which the drafters grounded the 1990 Code...|$|R
60|$|Observe what monstrous {{consequences}} {{would result}} from a contrary position. A foreign enemy has entered, or a strong domestic one has arisen in the nation. In such events the circumstances may be, and often have been, such that a Parliament cannot sit. This was precisely the case in that rebellion in Ireland. It will be admitted also, that their power may be so great as {{to make it very}} prudent to treat with them, in order to save effusion of blood, perhaps to save the nation. Now could such a treaty be at all made, if your enemies, or rebels, were fully persuaded, that, in these times of confusion, there was no authority in the state which could hold out to them an inviolable pledge for their future security, but that there lurked in the Constitution a dormant, but irresistible power, who would not think itself bound by the ordinary subsisting and contracting authority, but might rescind its acts and obligations at pleasure? This would be a doctrine made to perpetuate and exasperate war; and on that principle it directly impugns the law of nations, which is built upon this principle, that war should be softened as much as possible, and that it should cease as soon as possible, between contending parties and communities. The king has a power to pardon individuals. If the king holds out his faith to a robber, to come in on a promise of pardon, of life and estate, and, in all respects, of a full indemnity, shall the Parliament say that he must nevertheless be <b>executed,</b> that his <b>estate</b> must be forfeited, or that he shall be abridged of any of the privileges which he before held as a subject? Nobody will affirm it. In such a case, the breach of faith would not only be {{on the part of the}} king who assented to such an act, but on the part of the Parliament who made it. As the king represents the whole contracting capacity of the nation, so far as his prerogative (unlimited, as I said before, by any precedent law) can extend, he acts as the national procurator on all such occasions. What is true of a robber is true of a rebel; and what is true of one robber or rebel is as true, and it is a much more important truth, of one hundred thousand.|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho tem como objetivo discorrer sobre as formas de manutenção e retirada dos contratos administrativos inválidos. Ao se partir da premissa de que um contrato administrativo, tal como qualquer outro ato jurídico, introduz normas jurídicas no sistema jurídico-positivo, será preciso antes de tudo saber quando uma norma existe para o ordenamento jurídico, bem como quando ela será considerada válida ou inválida. Além disso, será importante apontar o sentido do termo eficácia. Em seguida, indicar-se-á o conceito de contrato administrativo a ser adotado neste trabalho, procurando analisá-lo a partir dos elementos e pressupostos do ato administrativo, o que se revelará bastante útil ao se estudar a convalidação dos contratos administrativos inválidos. Depois de se apresentar o conceito de invalidade e suas espécies no direito brasileiro, abordar-se-á as hipóteses de manutenção, no direito positivo, dos contratos administrativos inválidos, quais sejam, a convalidação, a conversão e o saneamento. Ao final deste trabalho, a invalidação e a sustação dos contratos administrativos inválidos pelo Poder Legislativo e pelos Tribunais de Contas que são formas de retirada de contratos administrativos inválidos serão objeto de estudoThe {{main purpose}} of this work is to argue about the ways to {{continue}} or terminate with the agreements <b>executed</b> by the <b>Estate</b> (or its companies) that were declared invalid (Administrative Contracts). Starting from the premise that Administrative Contracts, as any other legal actions, insert normative rulings on the statutory law system, {{it is necessary to}} know whenever they will be considerer valid or not valid.

Afterwards, it will be stated the concept of Administrative Contract that is adopted herein, which is based on the principles and prerequisites of the public actions. This shall be useful for the discussion of the revalidation of the invalid Administrative Contract. Once we present, according to the Brazilian law, the concept of the invalidity and its varieties, it will broach the hypotheses for the maintenance of an invalid Administrative Contract on the statutory law, which are the revalidation, the conversion and the remedy.

40|$|The term "mass-customization" in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) {{industry}} {{refers to}} architectural elements that have similar purpose but are {{completely different from}} each other. Architects use mass-customized elements to give diverse design to different parts of a building. Mass-customization derives from three developments in computational technology: Building Information Modeling (BIM), the implications of programing in graphical representation, and the progress of computer-controlled manufacturing machines. However, the promise held by these technologies has not been fulfilled. While mass-customization is implemented in projects with large budgets, they are rarely employed in mainstream real estate. This thesis examines two multi-family projects: The Project on 8 Spruce Street and the Porter House, both located in Manhattan, to outline the challenges of <b>executing</b> commercial real <b>estate</b> projects that employ mass-customized envelope systems and makes suggestions {{as to how to}} overcome them. The thesis then examines the aircraft manufacturing industry, which is proficient in the use of Building Information Modeling and has advanced logistical expertise in transporting large-scale elements. The thesis examines its use of design and assembly processes such as Concurrent Engineering and Lean Manufacturing, and suggests that these techniques can be incorporated into the project delivery methods of the AEC industry. The thesis focuses on the production of fuselage and metallic wing skin panels, distinguishing between fabrication technologies that are used for the manufacturing of single-curved and double-curved panels. The thesis proposes ways in which these processes can be adapted to the standards of the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry, and suggests that such adaptation could reduce fabrication costs. The thesis concludes by outlining the incentives for the aircraft industry to transition part of its operation into the fabrication of mass-customized envelopes for commercial real estate, pointing to the potential markets for such systems in the growing economies of China, Latin America and India. This thesis attempts to demonstrate the potential of utilizing features of the aircraft manufacturing industry so as to improve cooperation between all parties involved in the process of commercial real estate development and to create more beautiful and valuable buildings. by Shaul Goldklang.

40|$|A {{consensus}} {{has begun}} to develop in the case law, the academic commentary, and the statutory reform movement that a testator’s provision in her will mandating arbitration of any challenge to the will should not be enforceable against a beneficiary who has not agreed to the arbitration provision, at least where the will contestant, by her contest, seeks to increase her inheritance outside the will. Grounding this consensus is the widespread understanding that a will is not a contract. This Article seeks to challenge both the understanding that the will is not a contract and the opposition to enforcement of testator-compelled arbitration provisions that arises from that understanding. This Article argues that the will {{is part of an}} implied unilateral contract between the testator and the state in which the state offers to honor the testator’s donative intent and the testator accepts and provides consideration for the offer by creating and preserving wealth. Importantly, the greater contract respecting donative freedom of which the will is a part also includes a provision providing for the distribution of an individual’s intestate property in line with that individual’s imputed intent should the individual fail to <b>execute</b> an effective <b>estate</b> plan. Similar to the testator, the property owner who has failed to make an effective estate plan accepts this offer of intestate distribution through her industry and thrift. This Article’s theory borrows from the law respecting implied unilateral contracts arising from employee handbooks in concluding that it should be of no moment that the property owner is unfamiliar with the specifics of the state probate code. Rather, the critical factor should be that the state has, through its offer to respect donative intent, created an atmosphere that is “instinct with an obligation” and that encourages diligence and the prudent management of wealth. The conclusion that the will is a contract between the testator and the state grounds this Article’s additional argument that the Federal Arbitration Act and state arbitration statutes require enforcement of a testator-compelled arbitration provision contained in a will even against a beneficiary who has not agreed to the arbitration provision. Settled arbitration law in conjunction with third-party beneficiary theory or direct benefits estoppel theory supports binding the beneficiary to the will’s arbitration contract. A virtue of this Article’s theory that the will and the intestacy statute are both clauses in a greater donative freedom contract is that the analysis escapes the limitations inherent in the dominant understanding that a will’s arbitration clause, if enforceable at all, can be enforced only against a beneficiary who seeks by her will contest to increase her inheritance under the will as opposed to circumstances in which the donee seeks to increase her intestate inheritance. According to the conventional wisdom, even if arbitration clauses are enforceable in some testamentary instruments, they govern only a narrow range of claims. This Article’s implied unilateral contract theory goes further and expands the universe of arbitrable contests. Specifically, this Article’s theory is the first theory that encompasses even a will contest that seeks to render the will a complete nullity...|$|R
