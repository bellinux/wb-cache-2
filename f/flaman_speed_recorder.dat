50|$|The <b>Flaman</b> <b>Speed</b> Indicator and <b>Recorder</b> was {{a device}} {{patented}} in 1901 by Nicolas Charles Eugène Flaman of France for indicating the current {{speed of a}} vehicle (for example a railway locomotive) and recording it on a paper tape that could be unrolled and examined {{at the end of}} a run to provide evidence of the speeds attained on the journey.|$|R
50|$|France {{developed}} the <b>Flaman</b> <b>Speed</b> Indicator and <b>Recorder.</b> In Germany, the Indusi train protection system had included recording equipment from early on using a ticker tape on paper. For I60R a generalized recorder system was installed (Datenspeicherkassette DSK / data storage cassette) that {{allowed to enter}} the train number, driver info, train weight along with the driving events. The standardized DSK black box allows for approximately 30,000 km of general recording data and 90 km of detailed recording data. Later models of the DSK are electronic especially since {{the introduction of the}} computerized PZ80/PZB90 train protection generations.Modern Train Event Recorders follow International or National Standards like IEEE Std. 1482.1-1999, FRA 49 CFR Part 229, IEC 62625-1 etc. specifying the digital and analogue data to be acquired, recorded and transmitted for further analysis. The need for event recorders to sustain an accident has led to companies like Faiveley (France), Hasler Rail (Switzerland), Bach-Simpson (USA), Saira Electronics (Italy) FAR Systems, MIOS Elettronica (Italy) to develop crash protected memory modules as a part of their event recorders. These new generation event recorders have growing demand both for rapid transit systems and mainline trains, in Europe, United States,India, etc.|$|R
50|$|The Flaman {{recorder}} {{was used}} {{in a number of}} countries, and in particular France on the Nord, Est, PLM and Etat railways. By 1914 about 80% of French locomotives were equipped with a <b>speed</b> <b>recorder.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to an inquest {{into the}} accident, the fireman of the Southern Aurora, M. Coulthard, had been {{recorded}} on the Hasler <b>speed</b> <b>recorder</b> as pressing the vigilance control button {{when the train}} passed through the danger signals at the crossing loop.|$|R
50|$|Following this accident, lineside speed {{restriction}} signs were universally adopted; previously {{there had been}} no visual reminder to the driver of {{speed restriction}}s on many routes. The Inspector also suggested the use of <b>speed</b> <b>recorders,</b> as in France, but this was not adopted.|$|R

5000|$|No. 999 entered {{service in}} 1893, making {{the trip from}} Syracuse, New York. The Express was {{recorded}} traveling at 102.8 mph on May 9 and at 112.5 mph on May 10, between Batavia and Buffalo. If true {{it would have made}} No. 999 the first object on wheels to exceed 100 mph, but no documentation (i.e. passing times at a sequence of identified points) has been given. The railway enthusiast and experienced timer of trains J P Pearson travelled behind 999 on May 10, he later described the trip in detail in his book [...] "Railways & Scenery". The highest speed he recorded between New York and Buffalo was 81 mph sustained for several miles whilst descending from Batavia to Buffalo, a high speed for a regular passenger train of that era, though one that had been exceeded by other locomotives in special trials. Although 999 was fitted with a <b>speed</b> <b>recorder</b> the 100 mile an hour claims were based on milepost timings by newspaper reporters. The highest speed seen on the <b>speed</b> <b>recorder</b> appears to be 86 miles an hour in April 1893.|$|R

50|$|It {{remains unknown}} whether {{the train was}} {{exceeding}} the speed limit {{at the time of}} the wreck. Locomotive No. 1104 did not have a <b>speed</b> <b>recorder.</b> The ICC report of July 11, 1925, incorrectly lists the speed limit at Rockport as 70 mph; the 1925 employee timetable lists the speed limit on the entire 40-mile DLW Old Road as 50 mph. When the ICC interviewed the train's flagman in the days following the accident, he said the train was traveling 70 mph at Rockport. Several porters told the ICC that they thought the train was traveling about 45 mph; the flagman subsequently revised his account to 50 mph.|$|R

5000|$|A {{suggestion}} in The Times of 10 October 1853, {{commenting on}} a rail collision near Portarlington station, Great Southern and Western Railway, on 5 October that year, {{called for a}} paper-roll recorder to be carried in a locked box on trains, recording wheel revolutions against time, the record to be removed and stored by station masters at the destination station. A similar proposal came from Charles Babbage, arising from his work for the Great Western Railway on dynamometer cars, in 1864. No action {{seems to have been}} taken in either case.

This system is capable of collecting approximately one hundred megabytes per second of filtered packetized data.

Approximately of 10 % fatalities is caused by tank truck accident, it recorded by PT.

Therefore, over speed has become main factor the occurrence of tank truck accident. Main objective of this research is to install speed limiter on the tank truck in order to improve safety engineering system, decrease accident and to maintain engine performance. This research is conducted in Indonesia especially in Java-Bali route travel. Speed limiter is installed to the tank truck engine which completed by fuel cut-off solenoid to reduce the speed automatically when it exceeding the maximum speed that has been determined. From the result shows that top speed which performed by driver up to 133 km/h when tank truck uninstalled by speed limiter. Meanwhile, when speed limiter is installed to the tank truck, top speed locked at 70 km/h even though the driver want to speed up. It means that fuel cut-off system is very effective to lock the speed at 70 km/h and it shown the improvement up to 65 %.
