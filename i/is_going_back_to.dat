25|$|Michelle (now {{played by}} Jenna Russell) returns to Walford on Christmas Eve and reunites with Sharon, staying with Martin (now played by James Bye) {{and his second}} wife Stacey Fowler (Lacey Turner). Sharon {{suspects}} something is wrong as Michelle has left Mark and Tim behind, but Michelle refuses to talk about it. Michelle and Martin reminisce about their family but Stacey is annoyed by Michelle's presence. Michelle announces she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Florida but Stacey overhears her breaking down {{on the phone to}} Tim. Michelle confides in Sharon that Mark has left home with his girlfriend and that she and Tim have not had sex for almost two years. She then tells Sharon that back in Florida she had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old student, Preston Cooper (Martin Anzor). Sharon allows Michelle to stay with her and Michelle starts drinking alcohol on her own. Sharon and Phil go on holiday, leaving Michelle to look after the home and their children Louise Mitchell (Tilly Keeper) and Dennis Rickman Jnr (Bleu Landau). On Valentine's Day, Preston turns up and he and Michelle kiss passionately. Michelle goes for a job interview at a teaching agency, but fails to get the job as they find out from her references about her relationship with Preston. Michelle insists that he should go home but he tries to win her back, though she is adamant their relationship is over. Michelle then sees Preston with her niece, Bex Fowler (Jasmine Armfield), and Preston manipulates Michelle into catching him in bed with Bex, and she realises he is using Bex to make her jealous. The plan apparently works as Michelle and Preston have sex again. Dennis then discovers Michelle and Preston's relationship and starts blackmailing Michelle into buying him trainers and allowing him time off school.|$|E
2500|$|During an October 2008 {{interview}} for Spin.com, Lee noted {{that she was}} writing new songs, possibly for a solo album project. Citing influences in folk and Celtic music, she says her current writings feel like she <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> her [...] "really old" [...] roots. She gave no potential release date, but said of her reason for this new direction, [...] "I need to show that I'm more than a one trick pony." ...|$|E
2500|$|The group started 2000 {{by playing}} its second Big Day Out tour. It {{continued}} touring internationally playing the US, Canada and New Zealand. Daymon recalled [...] "There have been times, especially after Someday Shambles, when our popularity in Australia had really surprised {{us and we}} were playing to huge crowds at the Big Day Out and we'd had two really successful records. We were a little dismayed as to why we couldn't push it further into the overseas area. Unfortunately {{it seemed to be}} the politics of working with a record on a major label that held us back. It's not much of an incentive for a label overseas to make you a priority if a lot of the profit <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the company where the band is from". In August, the group issued a six-track split EP with Jimmy Eat World, Jebediah / Jimmy Eat World in the US through independent label, Big Wheel Recreation.|$|E

It would have needed something more than sea-sickness and quap fever to prevent my spirits rising.|$|R

60|$|We {{talked about}} the land. The war has {{practically}} gutted Sardinia of her cattle: so they said. And now the land is being deserted, the arable land <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> fallow. Why? Why, says the driver, because {{the owners of the}} land won't spend any capital. They have got the capital locked up, and the land is dead. They find it cheaper to let all the arable go back to fallow, and raise a few head of cattle, rather than to pay high wages, grow corn, and get small returns.|$|E

60|$|Let us {{reason a}} little {{together}} on these things, {{and let us}} inquire a little, why, and for what reason Britain, so lately the glory of Europe; so lately the terror of France, the bulwark of religion, and the destroyer of popery, should be brought to be the gazing-stock of the world?
