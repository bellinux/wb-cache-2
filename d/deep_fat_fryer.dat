Pickup of batter and breading and yields for the separate parts at each step were determined. Evaluation of frozen, reheated parts included taste paneling and determination of shear values. Moisture and fat analyses were performed on samples after the first cooking. Final average yield (final weight/raw weight) for combined parts was highest for pieces cooked by FSF, followed by FOC in both experiments. Sensory scores for texture, tenderness, juiciness, flavor, and overall acceptability of meat were generally optimum for parts cooked by all methods.

Tortilla chips were prepared from commercial nixtamilized dry masa flour. They were baked and then fried in fresh and used partially hydrogenated soybean oil for 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 45 and 60 seconds at 1500 C and 1900 C. A commercial batch fryer was used. Heat and mass transfer during <b>deep</b> <b>fat</b> <b>fryer</b> of tortilla chips were analyzed in this study. The effects of oil degradation and frying oil temperature on the rate of moisture loss and oil absorption, and on the physical and thermal properties of tortilla chips during frying were investigated. Viscosity, effective thermal conductivity, and specific heat of the frying oil were also measured. Density, effective thermal conductivity, and specific heat of tortilla chips decreased during frying. After 60 seconds of frying the oil tended to concentrate around the puffed areas of the tortilla chips. The formation of the sponge-like network and the crust of the tortilla chip started around the first IO seconds of frying. Thermal and physical properties of the tortilla chips such as density, effective thermal conductivity, and texture should be analyzed before and after 10 seconds of flying. At this time most of the tortilla chip is fully gelatinized and the crust starts to develop at the surface. Results after IO seconds were in better agreement with the models investigated. An increase in oil deterioration and in the flying temperature seem to cause an increase in the water evaporation rate from the tortilla chip and an increase in the total amount of oil absorbed by the tortilla chip during frying. The convective heat transfer coefficient decreased with oil degradation and increased with temperature. Viscosity of the frying oil increased with oil degradation and decreased with temperature. Effects of oil degradation and oil temperature on tortilla chips' properties such as density, effective thermal conductivity, and specific heat were not clearly established, and need further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Deep-fat frying is an important, {{common and}} highly {{versatile}} process, {{which has been}} used from antiquity to cook {{a wide variety of}} products. During deep-fat frying, hydrolysis, oxidation and polymerization reactions cause a spectrum of physical and chemical changes, leading to the formation of decomposition products posing a direct impact damaging both the oil quality and the fried food nutritional value. The amount and type of degradation products formed in frying oils is primarily dependent on the fatty acid composition of the frying oil, so {{it is important to keep}} this in mind in selecting frying oils. Therefore, the choice of medium frying remains of great interest and of crucial importance, not only for its potential nutritional value but also for its ability to withstand the drastic conditions of this cooking technique. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of discontinuous and prolonged heat treatment on five oils, characterized by different ratios of unsaturated/saturated fatty acids. In addition, we attempted to identify possible markers of heat treatment correlated with total polar compounds (TPC) in assessing the quality of used frying oils. The determination of TPC has been adopted as a unique official method to test for excessive use of fats for frying. But because there are many variables that affect oil degradation, a specific marker may be ideal for one oil but completely useless in another. In fact, the work wanted to show that it is not correct to use the same indicator for all fatty matrices but, on the basis of the fatty acid composition of the oil or fat used in frying, the indicator that best suits it. The experimentation was carried out by a prolonged and discontinuous deep-fat frying process with frozen pre-fried potatoes (McCain) and by a simple thermo-oxidation process of oil without food matrix. Both thermal treatments were conducted over a period of 8 h per day for 6 days. Every hour, 200 g of frozen pre-fried potatoes were deep fried for 4 min (based on preliminary trials). The batch volume of <b>deep</b> <b>fat</b> <b>fryer</b> was 3 L. Fresh oil was added every 8 h after oil samples were collected, to maintain a constant level in the fryer. The oils used were: bi-fractionated palm oil, olive oil, sunflower oil, lard, and a mix oil. After frying process, the French fries were subjected to fat extraction. Three sets of samples were collected: •	thermo-oxidized oil samples •	frying oil samples •	fat samples extracted from French fries So, the samples analyzed correspond to following treatment hours: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48 and the oil and French fries samples of time “ 0 ”. All samples were subjected to the following determinations: •	free fatty acids (FFA) determination by alkaline titration; •	peroxide value (PV) determination by iodometric titration; •	TPC determination; •	fatty acids (FA) composition determination by gas-chromatographic (GC) analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME); •	volatile organic compounds (VOC) analysis by dynamic head-space system (DHS) coupled with GC and mass spectrometer (MS). •	Statistical analysis. About performances of three sets of samples (thermo-oxidized, frying and extracted from potatoes), about FFA values, the best fat frying has proved to be the sunflower oil. About PV, during thermo-oxidation process the mix oil, followed by bi-fractionated palm oil, olive oil and sunflower oil, showed the best results while the lard showed the highest values. During frying process the worst oil appeared to be the mix oil and about fats extracted from French fries the worst oil appeared to be the sunflower oil. The sunflower oil appeared to be the best during frying, while about extraction from potatoes, lard was showed to have the lowest values. Considering the performance recorded in three sets of samples, about TPC determination, the best fat turned out to be the frying lard. About changes of fatty acids occurred during the heat treatment possible markers of oil degradation were: • For the bi-fractionated palm oil C 8 : 0 and Σtrans • For the olive oil UFA/SFA • For the sunflower oil C 18 : 2 n 6 cis, C 18 : 2 n 6 cis/C 16 : 0 and UFA/SFA • For lard UFA/SFA • For the mix oil C 8 : 0 Among VOCs, possible markers could be the Σalkanes for bi-fractionated palm oil, the Σalkadienals for olive oil samples, the octanal and butyl pyrrole for sunflower oil and 2 -E-nonenal, 2 -heptanone and Σketones for mix oil. The highly variable pattern of VOCs in lard is not allowed to get any good correlation. In conclusion a specific marker may be ideal for one oil but completely useless in another...|$|E
