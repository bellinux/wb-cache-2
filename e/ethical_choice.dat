[...] He {{also pointed out that}} the Supreme Court in the Gian Kaur case explicitly recognises the right to live with human dignity within the ambit of right to life. He further cited that the Supreme Court wrote in the said case, [...] " [...] may include the right of a dying man to also die with dignity when his life is ebbing out. But the right to die with dignity {{at the end of life}} is not to be confused or equated with the right to die an unnatural death curtailing the natural span of life." ...|$|E
500|$|Around 1990, the {{brothers}} {{decided to create}} a game that would appeal to adults. Among their goals were believable characters, a non-linear story, and for the player as protagonist to make ethical choices. The Millers pitched the game to Activision under the title The Gray Summons; Robyn recalled that Activision told them to stick to children's games. At {{the time of the}} rejection, Robyn recalled they were not doing well financially—"we were eating rice and beans and government cheese and that [...] our diet." [...] Facing the end of their game-producing career, Sunsoft approached the Millers to create an adult-oriented game. Like with The Gray Summons, the Millers wanted their game to have a non-linear story with believable characters and an <b>ethical</b> <b>choice.</b> They also wanted to produce a game with far more impressive graphics than their previous efforts—at one point they considered making the game entirely hand-drawn. Finally, they knew their story would be a mystery.|$|E

[...] Sarah's storyline also explores her moral culpability following Andrew's suicide. Personal accountability is a central theme of the novel, with Elkins of The New York Times opining that by not focusing on [...] "postcolonial guilt or African angst", Cleave is able to use the novel to challenge readers' conceptions of civility and <b>ethical</b> <b>choice.</b> Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle similarly feels that the book delivered a message of anti-complacency, however believes that is does so by [...] "bemoaning the normality of the First World in the face of the horrors of the Third." [...] She deemed The Other Hand essentially a novel about [...] "the borders we draw, and the real damage they inflict".|$|E

The paper first discusses globalization, its theorized sources and consequences, exposing connections between globalization and local developments in diverse milieux. It is pointed out that the ways in which global and local developments interact are related to specific socio-historical and cultural configurations of every locality. Paradoxes which attend the conceptualization of <b>ethical</b> <b>choices</b> under these conditions are highlighted. Finally, conclusions are drawn about how multimethod research, including research designed to elicit emic theory, can contribute to an understanding of what is implied by the management of <b>ethical</b> <b>choices,</b> and of how ethical problems in the health arena can be approached. globalization <b>ethical</b> <b>choices</b> health arena...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Stewart took leading roles in three John Ford films, his first {{work with the}} director. The first, Two Rode Together, paired him with Richard Widmark in a Western with {{thematic}} echoes of Ford's The Searchers. The next, 1962's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, Stewart's first picture with John Wayne, is a classic [...] "psychological" [...] western, shot {{in black and white}} film noir style featuring powerful use of shadows in the climactic sequence, with Stewart as an Eastern attorney who goes against his non-violent principles when he is forced to confront a psychopathic outlaw (played by Lee Marvin) in a small frontier town. At story's end, Stewart's character — now a rising political figure — faces a difficult <b>ethical</b> <b>choice</b> as he attempts to reconcile his actions with his personal integrity. The film's billing is unusual in that Stewart was given top billing over Wayne in the trailers and on the posters but Wayne was listed above Stewart in the film itself. The complex picture garnered mixed reviews but was an instant hit at the box office and became a critical favorite over the ensuing decades.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops the}} thesis that the formulation, development, and application of hermeneutical principles or procedures {{are influenced by the}} way in which an interpreter choses to perceive [...] implicitly or explicitly [...] the ethical relationships that obtain among author, interpreter, and audience. The dissertation argues that interpreters choose their ethical stances actively or passively, and regard the influence of ethics on interpretation as either positive or negative. Those who seek actively an ethical standard, motivation, and justification and actively relate these ethical elements to the principles used to arrive at an interpretation consider the influence positive. Those who argue that an ethical standard, motivation, or justification should be removed or prevented from interfering with the hermeneutical process regard the possibility of such influence as a negative. ^ This thesis examines four significant individuals in the history of language use and interpretation who exemplify a wide range of attitudes toward the ethical standards of interpretation. The Apostle Paul argues for active <b>ethical</b> <b>choices</b> and the responsibility of an author; Augustine argues for submissive <b>ethical</b> <b>choices</b> and the responsibility of the interpreter; Ludwig Wittgenstein argues for the interpreter 2 ̆ 7 s resisting <b>ethical</b> <b>choices</b> out of concern for himself or herself; and Jacques Derrida argues for refusing <b>ethical</b> <b>choices</b> and the issue of alternatives. The concluding chapter examines various hermeneutical consequences of each of these four avenues of choice. ^ The purpose of this dissertation is to alert the reader to the fact that hermeneutics and literary interpretation are not ethically neutral. No attempt is made to examine all possible combinations and permutations of this ethical influence. Nevertheless, the dissertation demonstrates by means of Paul, Augustine, Wittgenstein, and Derrida, that ethics-positively or negatively [...] is a fundamental factor in the formulation, development, and application of hermeneutical principles and procedures. ...|$|R

50|$|Domestication and foreignization are {{strategies}} in translation, regarding {{the degree to}} which translators make a text conform to the target culture. Domestication is the strategy of making text closely conform to the culture of the language being translated to, which may involve the loss of information from the source text. Foreignization is the strategy of retaining information from the source text, and involves deliberately breaking the conventions of the target language to preserve its meaning. These strategies have been debated for hundreds of years, but the first person to formulate them in their modern sense was Lawrence Venuti, who introduced them to the field of translation studies in 1995 with his book The Translator's Invisibility: A History of Translation. Venuti's innovation to the field was his view that the dichotomy between domestication and foreignization was an ideological one; he views foreignization as the <b>ethical</b> <b>choice</b> for translators to make.|$|E
