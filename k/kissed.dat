5|$|Victoria settled an annuity on Louise {{shortly before}} her marriage. The {{ceremony}} {{was conducted at}} St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle on 21 March 1871, and the crowd outside was so large that, for the first time, policemen had to form chain barriers to keep control. Louise wore a wedding veil of Honiton lace that she designed herself, and was escorted into the Chapel by her mother, and her two eldest brothers, the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. On this occasion, the usually severe black of the Queen's mourning dress was relieved by the crimson rubies and blues of the Garter star. Following the ceremony, the Queen <b>kissed</b> Louise, and Lorne – {{now a member of}} the royal family, but still a subject – <b>kissed</b> the Queen's hand.|$|E

40|$|Kisspeptin was {{originally}} found as a peptide product of <b>Kiss</b> 1 gene {{and is now}} {{supposed to be an}} essential central regulator of reproduction in mammals. However, there is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that <b>kiss</b> 2, the paralogous gene for <b>kiss</b> 1, evolved in parallel during vertebrate lineage, and the <b>kiss</b> 2 product also activates the GPR 54 (kisspeptin receptor) signaling pathways. Therefore, it is now widely accepted that both <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 are the kisspeptin genes. Interestingly, either <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 or both have been lost during evolution in many vertebrate species, and the functional significance of <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 for the central regulation of reproduction is suggested to vary according to the species. Here, we argue that the steroid sensitivity of the <b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2 neurons has been well conserved during evolution among tetrapods and teleosts, and thus it may be the key to understanding the functional homologies of certain populations of kisspeptin (<b>kiss</b> 1 or <b>kiss</b> 2) neurons among different species of vertebrates. In the present review, we will first introduce recent advances in the study of steroid sensitive <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 systems in vertebrates and effects of peptide administrations in vivo. By comparing the similarities and differences between <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2 of neuronal localization and sensitivity to gonadal steroids in various tetrapods and teleosts, we discuss the evolution of kisspeptin neuronal systems after gene duplication of ancestral kisspeptin genes to give rise to <b>kiss</b> 1 and <b>kiss</b> 2...|$|R

In the TARDIS, Amy appears unable to remember seeing her picture in the orphanage and says that she told the Doctor, rather than Rory, when she believed she was pregnant, through fears that travelling in the TARDIS might have affected her child's development. As the trio sets off, the Doctor discreetly uses the TARDIS scanner to attempt to determine if Amy is pregnant.|$|E
5|$|According to medieval scholar Richard Zeikowitz, the Green Knight {{represents}} {{a threat to}} homosocial friendship in his medieval world. Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and {{poses a threat to}} their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and <b>kissed</b> and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.|$|E

Koṇḍañña <b>kissed</b> the Buddha's feet and stroked them with his hands. He advised his disciples not to mourn him before returning to the forest to pass away the following morning. He was cremated on a large sandalwood pyre which was constructed {{with the help of the}} elephants, and the ceremony was presided over by Anuruddha, one of the ten chief disciples and five hundred other monks. The ashes were later taken to Veluvana, where they were enshrined in a silver stupa.|$|E

Her film Java Head (1934), though generally considered a minor effort, was the only film in which Wong <b>kissed</b> the lead male character, her white husband in the film. Wong's biographer, Graham Russell Hodges, commented that this may be why the film remained one of Wong's personal favorites. While in London, Wong met Mei Lanfang, {{one of the most famous}} stars of the Beijing Opera. She had long been interested in Chinese opera and Mei offered to instruct Wong if she ever visited China.|$|E
5|$|Alpha Flights Northstar, {{a member}} of the {{original}} Alpha Flight superhero team, was the first major gay character created by Marvel Comics. Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979. The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992's Alpha Flight issue 106, the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame. Storylines involving Northstar in Alpha Flight and his limited series have generally ignored his sexuality: Criticism has been levelled at the fact that in 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man, though he finally <b>kissed</b> his boyfriend Kyle in the first issue of the 2011 relaunch of the series. Northstar eventually became {{a member of}} the X-Men. During his time in this team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole, who later became a Young X-Men member along with another gay teen, Graymalkin.|$|E
