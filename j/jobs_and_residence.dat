40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} relationship between earnings and commuting disparities by gender. Applying a revealed preference framework, this study derives simultaneous <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> location decision model. I use a consumption good index, which is the 2 ̆ 2 full 2 ̆ 2 annual income earned by husband and wife minus commuting time evaluated at the hourly wage rate and minus housing rent. I derive the first order conditions for maximizing the composite good level with respect to three location choice variables, namely husband 2 ̆ 7 s job location, wife 2 ̆ 7 s <b>job</b> location, <b>and</b> household <b>residence</b> location. I develop five alternative location decision sequences and a spatial immobility index to investigate empirically welfare differences by gender arising from the <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> location decisions within two-earner households. ^ Two metropolitan areas are used to empirically investigate how urban form (macro <b>job</b> <b>and</b> housing markets) influences the economic welfare for workers in two-earner households. The Philadelphia SMSA has more concentrated <b>and</b> inward clustered <b>job</b> <b>and</b> housing markets. The Detroit SMSA has more even <b>and</b> outward scattered <b>job</b> <b>and</b> housing markets. ^ Regardless of the sequence of <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> location decisions, wives are unable to decrease the earnings gaps with husbands by changing residence or job locations or by commuting longer. Women earn less and their wage variation is less everywhere so that neither commuting nor residence adjustment can narrow significantly the gender earnings disparity. All sequences of location decisions show that wives (regardless of race and SMSA) have less incentive to commute longer than they actually do. The two-earner households select residential locations closer to wives 2 ̆ 7 job sites, resulting in wives 2 ̆ 7 shorter commutes. ^ This study finds no significant wage loss from any spatial immobility imposed by employed spouses for both husbands and wives in two SMSAs. But {{there is evidence that}} husbands and wives in the Philadelphia SMSA encounter greater costs when the immobility index is measured by commuting time. However, the different commuting time needed with and without locational constraints from spouse 2 ̆ 7 s job location is much lower and insignificant in the Detroit SMSA. I conclude that two-earner households are one source of urban overcommuting. However, an employment decentralized or dispersed urban form (case of Detroit) can decrease the commuting of two-earner households. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{reform of}} work unit (Danwei) system since 1980 s has {{substantially}} influenced spatial structure {{as well as}} people's life style in urban China. How to understand the great transformation of work unit system {{is very important to}} disentangle the socio-economic restructuring processes of Chinese cities. In this paper, we explained the origin, function and transformation of work unit system through literature study and enterprise interview, then we analyze the implication of work unit system reform, as one aspect of institutional changes in China, to people's daily life and urban spatial structure. There has been increasing interests in work unit system and its transformation. The earliest work came from sociological perspective, which has focused on such topics as the origin of work unit and its political-economic background, its organizational structures and power balance, multiple functions of a typical work unit, as well as the dependence of individuals to the work unit. In other words, sociologists pay more attention on the mechanism of work unit system, especially the control and dependence among the state, work unit and individual. Geographers, however, first noticed the role of work unit system through their studies on the urban spatial restructuring. Work unit system and its reform are regarded as the main constraints as well as impetus of the transformation of urban land use and social space. However, up to the present, many studies still remained rather descriptive. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework of work unit studies, while arguing that geographers should and are able to combine the two approaches. Work unit system is a series of institutions and systems of production organization and social control based on work units, which includes two main systems: personnel administration system and welfare system. The former includes authorized staff administration system, employment system, wage system, and employee evaluation and training system. The latter includes housing welfare system, collective consumption system, entertainment welfare system, subsidy system, and social security welfare system. Thus, work unit becomes the "cell" of urban society in China, which not only controls resource allocation and production organization, but is responsible to the social control and social welfare. A work unit is more of a "whole community" than merely a factory or a administrative organization. Work unit system has experienced great transformation since the adoption of the reform and open policy. One fundamental change was the breakdown of the "whole community" of Danwei. Market mechanism was introduced into social production sphere. The organization of work units has gradually been marketized to meet the requirement of market competition. Therefore, social welfare system was gradually separated from work units, i. e. it has been socialized and marketized too. Work units are no longer responsible to the provision of housing, health insurance or other items of social welfare. The reform aimed at work unit system has been one main impetus of the transformation of people's life style and daily life space. Within work unit system, people not only work in Danwei, live in the dwellings allocated as a type of welfare within the Danwei compound (Dayuan). Thus, not only the social relationship, but also the daily life is constrained within Danwei compound. Since the reform, however, individual's dependence to Danwei and work unit system has been weakened. With the breakdown of work unit system, urban residents now have more freedom in choosing <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence.</b> Consequently, job mobility and residential mobility both have been increasing. Home-work relationship has also been greatly shifted, due to the relocation of job opportunities and residences, from home-work proximity to increasingly long-distance commuting. Besides, people's activity space {{is becoming more and more}} extended from work unit compound (Dayuan). For example, our empirical studies on individual shopping space and leisure space have reveal the expansion and differentiation of residents'daily activity spaces of urban China. Urban morphology also experienced substantial restructuring process accompany with the breakdown of work unit system. Urban expansion is now more generated and influenced by urban redevelopment, the construction of industrial parks and residential communities, contrary to the significance of the Danwei construction before the reform. Consequently to the expansion and diversification of people's commuting space, housing search space, and activity space (such as shopping space and leisure space), major cities in China has been facing substantial restructuring. In addition, there has been a more and more apparent trend of urban socio-spatial stratification based on residential location. In the end, we argue that work unit system, although weaken, is still an important factor, to some extent, in urban China, which we call "the concealment of Danwei system". In some cities, residents still expect a "whole community" of Danwei, and Danwei is still the main source of welfare of them. Therefore, work unit system, as well as its transformation continues to be one main perspective of understanding urban China, which requires further studies...|$|E

This paper centres on the {{development}} of a geometrical representation of movement and spatial interaction in urban areas, as distinct from the network representation commonly used in modern studies. All quantities are treated as distributions over geographic space, rather than concentrations at nodes of a network. We present a continuous model of spatial interaction and calibrate it for Greater Manchester. The model is a trip distribution model which produces an allocation of trips from any area to all other areas in accordance with a derived trip density function. The inputs to the model are density functions for <b>residences</b> <b>and</b> workplaces of car commuters, and a velocity field. The velocity field defines a measure of the travel time between different locations. The outputs of the model are spatial distributions of accessibility of locations to <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> <b>residences,</b> <b>and</b> a spatial distribution of traffic flow. We find that the location most accessible to jobs in Manchester is not in the centre of the city, but in a ring more than half a mile away from the centre.

Un-priced traffic congestion causes an excess urban sprawl reflected in an average personal daily travel time 13 % or 8 minutes too long. Efficiency gains that curb this excess sprawl come from congestion tolls on traffic. To get the same travel improvement, a Portland-style urban boundary would directly limit urban size by a huge greenbelt. This entails a deadweight loss almost 70 times the efficiency gains from tolls. Urban boundaries can be efficient if urban workers greatly value the greenbelt or the urban compactness it creates as a pure public good. Nevertheless, such efficient boundaries increase congestion and tolls are still needed to reduce travel times. Urban sprawl, general equilibrium, traffic congestion, urban boundaries...|$|R

My analysis is substantially aided by the availability of new data on workers’ talents (or skills). The first chapter of the thesis exploits the fact that workers choose occupations according to their talents in order to study the effects on wages of the declining demand for manufacturing and clerical occupations. This is done by relating the occupational choices and the wages associated with particular talents over two representative cohorts of young workers in the United States between the late 1980 s and the late 2000 s. The second chapter, which is conjoint work, analyses the effect of an inflow of talent on productivity and output in the academic sector. We exploit the countercyclical relative attractiveness of academia as an employer over the business cycle to study periods of high (recessions) and low (booms) inflow of talent into that sector. Finally, the third chapter shows that government policy in the form of commuting tax breaks has substantial effects on the allocation of workers into <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> <b>residences.</b> In particular, I exploit two reductions of tax breaks for commuting in 2003 / 4 and 2006 / 7 in Germany to estimate commuting costs’ effects on workers’ decisions to change the location of their job and/or their house...|$|R

The trend of cancer incidence was calculated according to age, year of occurrence, family history, income, <b>and</b> <b>job</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> place. Data was analyzed using student T-test and chi-square test.  Findings: There were seen higher percentages of cancer amongst age above 50 years, married women and householders. Majority of those had education level of primary (% 40. 5) and moderate income level (% 49. 6). The highest incidence rate was related to year 2010 (% 30) and uterus cancers including body & endometrial was more common than others (% 42. 7). The association between cancer incidence and age (p<. 001) also disease occurrence and marital status (p=. 03) were seen statistically significant.

S. housing market reported in the 2000 census, most African Americans still reside in communities that are geographically separate from those of white Amer-icans. 1 Continued racial disparities in income, education, and employment mean that housing segregation is accompanied by the concentration of poverty and high rates of joblessness in predominantly black neighborhoods. The concentration of black households in older, predominantly inner-city neighborhoods, coupled with the continuing decentralization of employment within metropolitan areas, reduces the access to jobs of low-skilled inner-city residents. Lack of access is compounded by public transit systems that do not facilitate reverse commuting and by low rates of automobile ownership among poor minority households. This “spatial mismatch ” between the locations of low-skilled <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> the <b>residences</b> of low-skilled workers has been a focus of labor economists since the late 1960 s. 2 During the 1980 s, concern with the employment effects of residential seg-regation was subordinated to a more general concern with the external effect...|$|R
40|$|In the United States {{and other}} countries, many retirees face great {{difficulties}} in tracing their former employers {{in order to}} apply for a pension to which they are entitled. At the same time, pension plans have trouble tracking down pensioners with whom they have lost contact. The problem of lost pensions and lost pensioners was also prevalent in the United Kingdom and Australia, but these countries have established national pension registries. These registries have helped thousands of people receive their pension entitlements. In a dynamic economy where workers are changing <b>jobs</b> <b>and</b> changing <b>residences,</b> <b>and</b> employers are going out of business, moving, or being taken over, it is sometimes difficult for a worker with a claim to a pension benefit to locate the pension plan of a former employer. This article discusses what employees in the United States can do to try to locate a pension sponsored by a former employer. It then compares that with the situation for a worker in the United Kingdom and Australia. To briefly preview the findings, in the United States workers may need to contact a number of sources of information {{to try to find a}} lost pension. By comparison, a worker in the United Kingdom or Australia need only contact a single source. Both the Unite...|$|R
40|$|Why do {{factors of}} production, {{especially}} the labour, migrate from one region or sector to another? This question, which remains fundamental to economic and human resource development, {{has been a}} major topic among researchers. While considerable {{progress has been made in}} developing a theoretical model of migration, the empirical verification of this model using individual level data has remained unresolved. With the availability of Population, Labour Force, and Migration (PLM) Survey data, this paper attempts to develop a model of internal migration in Pakistan, to serve as a guiding paradigm to write down a model for meaningful estimation. Keeping in line with the literature, three types of variables have been identified as the possible determinants of migration. These variables relate to the possession of human capital, commitment to <b>job</b> <b>and</b> place of <b>residence,</b> <b>and</b> cost-related factors. After controlling for other variables, it was observed that, in general, migrants were selective especially in terms of age, education, and choice of occupation. These findings are consistent with the evidence from other developing countries. ...|$|R

The rewards of being considered normal’ in the context of high-HIV-prevalence Sub-Saharan Africa are varied and great… such rewards for which there is empirical support in this context include perceived sexual freedom, avoidance of discrimination, avoidance of community or family rejection, avoidance of losing one's <b>job</b> or <b>residence,</b> <b>and</b> avoidance of losing one’s sexual partners. Other potential rewards of being considered normal include avoidance of being associated with promiscuity or prostitution, avoidance of emotional, social and physical isolation and avoidance of being blamed for others’ illness” (150).|$|R
