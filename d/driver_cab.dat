25|$|Two demonstrator/prototype INNOVIA ART 100 {{cars were}} built {{and used for}} testing at the UTDC urban transit {{facility}} Millhaven, Ontario. Unlike the production cars, the demo cars lacked doors {{at either end of}} the vehicle. Test Vehicle 1 had windows in the centre and on the <b>driver</b> <b>cab,</b> while Test Vehicle 2 is a trailer car only had a centre window and no driver's cab. The paint scheme on the lead car was orange and white, while the trailer was grey and orange. The interior of the vehicle was unfinished (no seats, incomplete floor/ceiling and plywood panelling covering wiring). Only Test Vehicle 2 remained at the facility and in 2011 it was donated to the Canada Science and Technology Museum in Ottawa.|$|E
2500|$|... 1969: First cab {{regulation}} for mandatory partition requirement. Cost: approx. $100.00. This requirement, initially, {{was implemented}} specifically to stop an assailant's bullet from hurting the cab <b>driver.</b> <b>Cab</b> regulators instituted the partition requirement over the strenuous objections of cab drivers and cab owners. Their objections {{were regarded as}} {{less important than the}} speculations of an alleged majority of cab drivers. A slim majority of the cab drivers that were polled stated that they were in favor of a mandatory partition requirement according to the cab regulators. The drivers responded to the mail-in poll conducted by the BPDHD. The material used was 1/4" [...] Plexiglas and was not at all bullet resistant. [...] It was not bulletproof either. Nothing is bulletproof yet that is the term used consistently by cab regulators and the media when describing the protective nature of the partitions.|$|E
50|$|The {{front of}} the <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> are made from 4 mm thick steel plate. The front window panes can be {{utilised}} {{on either side of}} the locomotive, and are simply glued into the body without window frame. The roof of the <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> is part of the body, not the roof. The four doors on the sides lead directly into the <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> and are made of light alloy.|$|R
50|$|The cars {{featured}} {{two small}} <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> at both ends, which housed the vertical engines and transmission groups. The two platforms behind the <b>driver's</b> <b>cabs</b> were not identical; the first one, giving {{access to a}} small lavatory, was bigger and fitted with some folding seats; {{the one on the}} opposite side had a small luggage compartment. Both could be accessed by one door {{on each side of the}} car, giving access in turn to the <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> and the main passenger compartment.|$|R
50|$|The C20F has air {{conditioning}} {{in both the}} <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> and the passenger compartments, whereas the C20 has {{air conditioning}} in the <b>driver's</b> <b>cab</b> only. The exterior of the C20F differs by having smooth trolley sub-frames instead of the corrugated trolley sub-frames present in the C20.|$|R

50|$|Bodies {{of these}} {{locomotives}} differed from QR's diesel-electric locomotives which {{have only one}} driving cab whereas the electric had <b>driver</b> <b>cab</b> at each end. Each locomotive had an internal walkway connecting each cab. Bodies were the full width with no external walkway. The colour scheme was orange on either end, predominately white sides and green trim.|$|E
50|$|The {{new design}} {{incorporated}} an engine mounted longitudinally beneath a short hood and with rear-wheel drive. The LT adopted {{what had become}} the standard style of construction for bigger transporters. It also included economical direct-injection diesel engines, {{easy access to the}} <b>driver</b> <b>cab</b> behind the front axle, and a wide space between the driver and passenger seat.|$|E
50|$|Units 01-04 and 60-88 have a {{black band}} around the glass on the <b>driver</b> <b>cab</b> ends. These units are affectionately {{referred}} to as bandicoots. Units 60 and 67 for unknown reasons also have the black band on the guard cab end. The rest of the fleet have reverted to the original flat yellow ends in their recent refurbishment.|$|E

50|$|Toronto Fire Department {{began using}} {{motorized}} vehicles after 1910. Before that, the TFD and previous fire companies used horse drawn engines and ladders. Prior to the 1970s, the TFD had open air vehicles (<b>driver</b> <b>cab</b> not covered and mostly aerial trucks), {{but since then}} both the TFD and TFS use full covered vehicles. Prior to the 1950s, TFD used tiller-ladder trucks and since have reverted to smaller aerial units that can operate in narrow streets in Toronto.|$|E

5000|$|Since 2014 the Berlin S-Bahn {{introduces}} {{a system where}} an electronic monitor is in the <b>driver</b> <b>cab.</b> There is a camera on the platform that transmits the images via Wireless LAN to the train and the train has a connection back to the (existing) loudspeakers on the platform. The system was tested since 2007 but due to safety concerns its introduction was held off for several years. With its introducation a platform may be served in one-man operation either by ZAT-oU or the ZAT-FM, being the old [...] "" [...] ZAT-oU (train dispatching by train driver without technical support) or the new [...] "" [...] ZAT-FM (train dispatching by train driver with <b>driver</b> <b>cab</b> monitor). Officials {{pointed out that the}} one-man operation does even lower the time a train halts on a station - on the busy central lines the train {{on one side of the}} platform did often have to wait for the train in the opposite direction on the other side of the platform to be dispatched. Although most of the central lines will be converted to ZAT-FM there will be about 20 stations left in the network that will continue to have platform dispatchers.|$|E
50|$|In the museum, {{which is}} housed in the 1888-built and 1890-opened railway terminal, around 300 {{historical}} items are on display. The exhibits of the museum covering an area of 145 m2 include parts of the trains and the railway stations, photographs, and related documents. A few of these are furniture and silver services used in dining cars, station office equipment, the <b>driver</b> <b>cab</b> of an electric suburban train, manufacturer plates of some historic TCDD rolling stock, warning plates, and a station's clock and bell.|$|E
50|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{was first}} described and named by C.

50|$|The Unimog {{was quite}} successful, except as {{originally}} intended as an agricultural platform. Daimler-Benz produced a new vehicle in 1972, the MB Trac {{to be more}} oriented to larger scale mechanical farming. The new tractor crossed the Unimog technology of all-wheel drive and a power transmission to four large equal-sized wheels, {{with the appearance of}} a tractor: slim hood, behind it an angular, highly rising <b>driver</b> <b>cab.</b> In contrast to conventional tractors the cab is situated between the axles, similar to large four-wheel-drive tractors. There is no articulation between the front and rear sections as with larger tractors.|$|E
50|$|In this configuration, the {{pantograph}} {{will be on}} the cab cars (A car), {{while all}} three cars will have a motor each (no trailer cars). This train will be of a driverless operation (<b>driver</b> <b>cab</b> replaced by passenger space with a view out the front windows similar to that of an airport people mover). However, it is still possible to operate the train manually if needed. The train will feature a different interior compared to the Kwun Tong Line configuration as well as a different paint scheme and headlight styling. Designed in 16 months, 10 3-car trains are now in-service.|$|E
50|$|The minibuses in the A8V series {{were built}} on the chassis of the Mercedes-Benz Vario O818D. The body {{structure}} is made of steel tubes with square and rectangular cross-sections, which are joined together by welding. The outer structure, is welded to the frame, and is made of corrosion-resistant materials such as stainless steel and plastic. When compared to the previous model {{the seat next to}} the driver has been removed, which makes the <b>driver</b> <b>cab</b> very big. With larger dimensions and better built interior layout the minibus can carry more passengers when compared to the Autosan Solina.|$|E
