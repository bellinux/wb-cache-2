He would issue video game challenges and answered questions on cheats and tips. The show's host, Dominik Diamond, claimed that Moore did not understand anything that he said on the show, yet managed to record his contributions in single takes.|$|E
5|$|The {{goal of this}} {{executive}} order is to help address questions about favoritism in city contracting by preventing conflicts of interest, or even the appearance of such conflicts.... There should be a level playing field, where no one has an advantage—or a disadvantage—in obtaining city contracts, simply because they know me or anyone else in government.... Under the steps I'm taking today and recommending to the City Council, the public can easily learn <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know about a city contract: who is involved, who will benefit and whether the city is paying a fair price. I and every other city official {{must be prepared to}} defend every contract on its merits.|$|E

25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature of colours. Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge of the experience of colours (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, {{what it was like to}} see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects of colour.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{garnered}} {{a largely}} positive reception from critics. Entertainment Weekly {{wrote that the}} episode [...] "Powerfully depicts both Mulder's gnawing sense of defeat and his bond with Scully, strangely growing stronger with separation" [...] before concluding that the episode was [...] "fairly standard." [...] The site ultimately gave the episode a B. Reviewer Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club positively compared and contrasted the episode to the cartoon Scooby Doo, Where Are You? writing that, [...] "I {{used to be a}} huge [...] "Scooby Doo" [...] fan. [...] Of course, none of [...] were really monsters. [...] The X-Files exploited a simple truth: we all want to believe. We might be afraid of what's lurking in the dark, but isn't there always a bit of wishing inside that fear? A hope that what we think we know isn't <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know. That just once it might be nice to reach for a zipper and instead find nothing but cool scales." [...] Handlen ultimately called the episode [...] "Essential." [...] Reviewer Dan Barrett from the 400 Club wrote that [...] "The X-Files is off to a stonking good start with this season 2 opening." [...] Bob Curtright, writing for the Los Angeles Daily News, called the episode [...] "an engrossing chiller about potential contact from outer space." [...] He compared the episode positively to Close Encounters of the Third Kind and noted that the episode was [...] "both scary and wondrous" [...] and [...] "offer no pat answers that might tend to blow the credibility." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, writing that the episode was not [...] "what the fans were expecting, and its reputation isn't great. But I think this clever and claustrophobic little take, which does so much not only to refresh the show but to analyze what it's actually about, is one of the very best." ...|$|E

When out golfing, Bob claims to be [...] "conducting undercover research" [...] for the Ministry, claiming that he is taking soil and air samples (He once claimed that his golf ball was a [...] "dimpled ergonometer", and that his putter was a [...] "wind speed calibration wrench").|$|E
2500|$|If qualia of {{this sort}} exist, then a {{normally}} sighted person who sees red {{would be unable to}} describe the experience of this perception {{in such a way that}} a listener who has never experienced color will be able to know <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> know about that experience. Though it is possible to make an analogy, such as [...] "red looks hot", or to provide a description of the conditions under which the experience occurs, such as [...] "it's the color you see when light of 700-nm wavelength is directed at you", supporters of this kind of qualia contend that such a description is incapable of providing a complete description of the experience.|$|E

60|$|Later on, {{the journey}} became very agreeable. Godfrey was {{interested}} in everything, being of a quick and receptive mind, and Miss Ogilvy proved a fund of information.

5000|$|According to notable {{art critic}} and author Helen Khal, {{the years that}} al-Hariri spent in Italy {{training}} were: [...] "(...) intense and productive.

60|$|We were in {{a narrow}} river, where the tall trees met overhead, while the lower {{branches}} and the smaller trees brushed against the little boat as it steamed along.

We stood on the bow of the boat, which wasn't two feet above the water, and took in <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> see.|$|R

[...] "And who knows, perhaps {{all this is}} an opportunity given by Providence to open your eyes, which, I must say, are singularly blind. You think you know <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> learn, {{but the fact is that}} like the rest of us, you know nothing at all, and good man though you are, obstinately refuse to admit the truth and to seek support elsewhere.

[...] "Besides, I think we like primroses {{all the better}} because they must soon be over; but these are perennial blossoms, like the everlasting flowers and dried grass of a lodging house. They may still be beautiful, but by this time, Bagshot, they are awfully dry and dusty. Who looks at them? I notice our eyes avoid them even while we talk about them. We have all noticed <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be noticed, and said all the possible things {{that are to be}} said about them long ago. Surely a picture must be a little fresh to please. Else we shall come at last to the perfect picture, and art will have an end.

The largest things we saw were the braces which are especially strong—they were about one and a half or two meters long and 50–60 centimeters wide. As for the rest—broken into tiny pieces..." ...|$|R
60|$|Westover {{said that}} he did not blame her for not knowing her mind; he had been fifteen years {{learning}} his own fully. He asked her to take all the time she wished. If she could not make sure after all, he should always be sure that she was wise and good. She told him <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> tell of her breaking with Jeff, and he thought the last episode a supreme proof of her wisdom and goodness.|$|R

2500|$|Thomas Nagel first {{characterized}} {{the problem of}} qualia for physicalistic monism in his article, [...] "What <b>is</b> it like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bat?". Nagel argued that even if we knew <b>everything</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> know from a third-person, scientific perspective about a bat's sonar system, we still wouldn't know what it <b>is</b> like <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a bat. However, others argue that qualia are consequent of the same neurological processes that engender the bat's mind, and will be fully understood as the science develops.|$|R
