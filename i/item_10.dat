30|$|The {{five items}} loaded onto {{the second factor}} related to students’ worries about class. In other words, the items seemed to concern students’ {{perceived}} difficulty in understanding EFL class content. This latent construct is close to “General English performance anxiety” identified by Cheng et al. (1999), in that they shared most items exceeding 0.5 factor loadings (4, 15, 25, and 30). The term “performance anxiety” {{has to do with}} excessive perceived stress caused by the attention from an audience and the fear of failure, and the four <b>items</b> (4, <b>10,</b> 15, and 25) of the second factor seemed to concern such fear. Our second factor was also similar to Aida’s (1994) latent factor named “Fear of failing,” in that they both had <b>items</b> (<b>10</b> and 25) related to the fear of failing EFL courses. Moreover, the factor was analogous to Liu and Jackson’s (2008) second factor of test anxiety with three constituent <b>items</b> (<b>10,</b> 25, and 30). Based on these observations, the second factor in our analysis can be labeled “fear of failing.” The five items explained 10.86 % of the total variance. The correlation between the two components was significant (r[*]=[*] 0.62, p[*]<[*] 0.01); thus, oblique rotation methods seemed to be appropriate.|$|R

3000|$|The {{factor to}} which each item was {{assigned}} for the calculation of factor scores is indicated in gray shadow in Table  4. If an item loaded high {{on more than one}} factor, we assigned the item to one of the factors based on the magnitude of the factor loadings and interpretability. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient and the average interitem correlation, also presented in Table  4, were calculated for each factor as measures of internal consistency reliability. Although the Cronbach’s alpha coefficients of the Effortful Engagement and Engagement in Rewarding Activities factors were below the [...]. 70 guideline, the average interitem correlations lay within the proposed [...]. 15 – [...]. 50 range for all factors. All corrected item-total correlations were larger than [...]. 20, except for <b>Item</b> <b>10,</b> which had a corrected item-total correlation of [...]. 18 in the Purposeful Personal Expressiveness factor in the three-factor solution and of [...]. 19 in the Engagement in Rewarding Activities subfactor in the four-factor solution. With the removal of <b>Item</b> <b>10,</b> these factors’ Cronbach’s alpha coefficients increased to [...]. 77 and [...]. 60, respectively. Considering the fact that all average interitem correlations were above [...]. 15, we decided to retain all items, including <b>Item</b> <b>10,</b> for the calculation of factor scores. The performance of <b>Item</b> <b>10</b> should be scrutinised in further studies. Factor scores were calculated as the average score of the items assigned to the factor after reversal of reversed phrased questions’ scores.|$|E

30|$|The {{internal}} consistency of the four questions from the chronotype score (items 7 – 10) was acceptable (Cronbach’s alpha[*]=[*] 0.73; 95 % CI 0.67 to 0.79). The average correlation with the total score was r[*]=[*] 0.77 for the four items with the lowest correlation for preferred time to bed (r[*]=[*] 0.64; <b>item</b> <b>10)</b> and the highest correlation for self-reported chronotype (r[*]=[*] 0.86, item 9). The factor loadings for the chronotype four items based on the EFA (one factor, varimax rotation) were item 7 = 0.66, item 8 = 0.52, item 9 = 0.88, and <b>item</b> <b>10</b> = 0.51, with 44 % of the variance explained. The PCA of the chronotype items revealed a strong first component (2.23) with all other components having eigenvalues of less than 1.0 which indicated the scale is unidimensional and can be summed for a score.|$|E

We further developed a bare-bones scale with only 25 <b>items</b> (<b>10</b> <b>items</b> for job features, 12 items for total job, and 3 items for powerlessness).
