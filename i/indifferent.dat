5|$|Double-dipping {{involves}} {{taking a}} bite of a chip and then re-dipping it into a dip, which some people disapprove, while others are <b>indifferent.</b> Double-dipping transfers bacteria from a person's mouth into a dip, which can then be transferred to other consumer's mouths.|$|E
5|$|In another {{effort to}} impress Deangelo, Jim and Pam bring in CeCe, to which Deangelo reacts positively. While they {{celebrate}} {{getting back on}} his good side, Deangelo reveals to the camera {{that he is in}} fact <b>indifferent</b> to CeCe and was just being polite.|$|E
5|$|Advances in {{bacteriology}} in the 20th century increased {{the sophistication of}} possible bio-agents in war. Biological sabotage—in the form of anthrax and glanders—was undertaken {{on behalf of the}} Imperial German government during World War I, with <b>indifferent</b> results. In World War II, Britain weaponised tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins, but never used them.|$|E
5|$|After the premiere, most reviews were critical, and the French {{public was}} {{generally}} <b>indifferent.</b> Carmen initially gained its reputation {{through a series}} of productions outside France, and was not revived in Paris until 1883; thereafter it rapidly acquired popularity at home and abroad. Later commentators have asserted that Carmen forms the bridge between the tradition of opéra comique and the realism or verismo that characterised late 19th-century Italian opera.|$|E
5|$|An {{alliance}} between Przemysł II and Henry IV placed Bolesław the Pious {{in a very}} uncomfortable situation, because he {{being a member of}} Pro-Hungarian coalition of Polish princes (in addition to him, it included Bolesław V the Chaste, Leszek II the Black and Konrad II of Masovia) could not remain <b>indifferent</b> to this close cooperation with the Duke of Wrocław, which was the leader of the Pro-bohemian coalition (where other Silesian princes also belonged).|$|E
5|$|As the {{pregnancy}} progresses, Juno {{struggles with the}} emotions she feels for the baby's father, Paulie, who is clearly in love with Juno. Juno maintains an outwardly <b>indifferent</b> attitude toward Paulie, but when she learns he has asked another girl to the upcoming prom, she angrily confronts him. Paulie reminds Juno that it is at her request they remain distant and tells her that she broke his heart.|$|E
5|$|Dundas {{subsequently}} {{became a}} journalist for the Yorkshire Post and its editorial staff. Another {{who worked on}} the paper at the time, Richard Pape, recalled him as a man <b>indifferent</b> to his personal appearance, who wore frayed trousers, frequently had ink-stained hands and would spill beer over himself when drinking, yet who was also popular with the newspaper's younger, female staff members.|$|E
5|$|In February 1926, {{he signed}} the pacy winger Joe Hulme, {{followed}} that summer by forward Jack Lambert and full-back Tom Parker, who would later succeed Buchan as captain. Although Arsenal's league form was <b>indifferent,</b> in 1927 they reached the FA Cup Final, their first, but lost 1–0 to Cardiff City after an error by goalkeeper Dan Lewis.|$|E
5|$|Normally shy or <b>indifferent</b> to the {{presence}} of divers, the Caribbean reef shark has been known to become aggressive in {{the presence}} of food and grows sufficiently large to be considered potentially dangerous. As of 2008, the International Shark Attack File lists 27 attacks attributable to this species, 4 of them unprovoked, and none fatal.|$|E
5|$|Olaf died in 1006, and Olaf's widow Thorgerd {{subsequently}} {{directed a}} number of revenge-killings herself, including that of Thorkel, {{a man who had}} witnessed Kjartan's death but been <b>indifferent</b> to it and had not intervened. Bolli was killed by Olaf's sons and their allies in a raid led by Thorgerd. Some twelve years later, Gudrun, {{with the help of her}} friend Snorri Goði, had {{a number of}} Bolli's murderers killed in revenge.|$|E
5|$|Our World premiered to <b>indifferent</b> {{critical}} response but as {{the series}} progressed critics became effusive with their praise. Despite being critically well received and profitable for the network, Our World performed poorly in the Nielsen ratings, as its first half-hour was programmed against the extremely popular The Cosby Show. ABC canceled the show after one season. Ellerbee tried to move the series to PBS but was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Team USA named Hull an {{alternate}} captain of its veteran-laden {{team for the}} 2004 World Cup of Hockey. However, he was benched by head coach Ron Wilson following two <b>indifferent</b> games in {{which he did not}} register a point and never returned to the active lineup.|$|E
5|$|The Kombo Moyana series {{refers to}} a series of {{banknotes}} which carried Kombo Moyana's signature after being appointed governor of the Reserve Bank from 1983 to August 1993. The series bears the new name of Zimbabwe's capital (Harare) and is <b>indifferent</b> to the last two series except for the date and signature.|$|E
5|$|The New Testament {{gives no}} {{description}} of the physical appearance of Jesus before his death—it is generally <b>indifferent</b> to racial appearances and does not refer to {{the features of the}} people it mentions. Jesus probably looked like a typical Jew of his time and according to some scholars was likely to have had a sinewy appearance due to his ascetic and itinerant lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The bill's {{appearance}} {{is important in}} the interactions of the common blackbird. The territory-holding male responds more aggressively towards models with orange bills than to those with yellow bills, and reacts least to the brown bill colour typical of the first-year male. The female is, however, relatively <b>indifferent</b> to bill colour, but responds instead to shinier bills.|$|E
5|$|The film {{received}} positive {{attention from}} film critics. The Morning Telegraph praised {{it as the}} best work from the new Thanhouser Company. The The New York Dramatic Mirror found it to have good acting which could still be more expressive, but was more <b>indifferent</b> {{to the use of}} unnecessary connecting scenes. The Moving Picture World stated, in a brief review, that the acting and photography was good.|$|E
5|$|The {{liberation of}} Belgium begun in September 1944 as Allied forces moved eastwards. Brussels was liberated on 3 September. On 8 September, Pierlot and the {{government}} in exile arrived in the city by aeroplane. The return of the government was met with general indifference by the population, which felt the government had been <b>indifferent</b> {{to the plight of}} the population during the occupation.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully encounter {{a man and his}} physically disabled brother who lead the agents to an <b>indifferent</b> genie whose willingness to grant wishes belies a deeper motive.|$|E
5|$|Although largely <b>indifferent</b> to awards, Gielgud had {{the rare}} {{distinction}} of winning an Oscar, an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony. He was famous {{from the start}} of his career for his voice and his mastery of Shakespearean verse. He broadcast more than a hundred radio and television dramas between 1929 and 1994, and made commercial recordings of many plays, including ten of Shakespeare's. Among his honours, he was knighted in 1953 and the Gielgud Theatre was named after him. From 1977 to 1989, he was president of the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.|$|E
5|$|Ball {{struggled}} {{in his first}} season in charge, 1989–90, and his Stoke side were relegated to the third tier of English football after finishing bottom of the Second Division. The start of the 1990–91 season in the Third Division marked the first time Stoke had played at this level in 63 years. Ball kept his job for the start of this campaign but departed in February 1991 {{in the midst of an}} <b>indifferent</b> season that saw Stoke finish in their lowest league position of 14th.|$|E
5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly <b>indifferent</b> to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{military}} background, Andronikos failed {{to deal with}} Isaac Komnenos, Béla III of Hungary (r. 1172–1196) who reincorporated Croatian territories into Hungary, and Stephen Nemanja of Serbia (r. 1166–1196) who declared his independence from the Byzantine Empire. Yet, none of these troubles would compare to William II of Sicily's (r. 1166–1189) invasion force of 300 ships and 80,000 men, arriving in 1185. Andronikos mobilised a small fleet of 100 ships to defend the capital, {{but other than that}} he was <b>indifferent</b> to the populace. He was finally overthrown when Isaac Angelos, surviving an imperial assassination attempt, seized power with the aid of the people and had Andronikos killed.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>indifferent</b> form on {{the part}} of both Forster and Southampton as a whole, Southampton became the first team in history to reach the League Cup final without conceding a single goal. However, Southampton lost 3–2 to Manchester United in the final on 26 February 2017. Forster had a good match in Southampton's {{scoreless}} draw with Liverpool at Anfield on 7 May 2017; saving James Milner's 65th minute penalty kick, and then pushing Marko Grujic's header over the crossbar in injury time.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} palace, three {{servants}} and guards were killed, and about thirty more staff were injured. Outside the palace grounds, an American contractor died after falling from a rooftop {{where he had}} been watching the bombing. Despite the confusion, most of the city's inhabitants went about their usual business, <b>indifferent</b> to the chaos. The attack lasted 30 minutes and though they carried enough bombs to level the palace, the pilots did not expend all their munitions.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>indifferent</b> form in 2004 {{and poor}} form in 2005, he was {{dropped from the}} team in October 2005. Having been {{nominated}} and rejected in 2000, when the game suffered a tarnished reputation due to match fixing scandals, the captaincy was passed to Dravid, his former deputy. Ganguly decided against retiring and attempted to make a comeback to the team. Ganguly was awarded the Padma Shri in 2004, India's fourth highest civilian award, in recognition of his distinguished contribution {{in the field of}} sports. He was presented with the award on 30 June 2004, by then President of India, Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam.|$|E
5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came <b>indifferent</b> were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as he was here you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E
5|$|In August 1989, Cranor {{proposed}} {{amendments to}} the existing 1976 contract for US franchisees: PepsiCo could take over weak franchises, existing restaurants would not be safeguarded against competition from new outlets, and PepsiCo would {{have the right to}} increase royalty fees. The contract proved controversial amongst franchisees, who countered with a lawsuit, and the issue was not resolved until 1996. PepsiCo was accused of behaving in an imperious manner towards franchisees, who it believed were holding back the firm's growth, while the franchisees believed they had been the backbone of the company during a succession of <b>indifferent</b> corporate owners.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Kohli {{was bought}} on a youth {{contract}} by the Indian Premier League franchise Royal Challengers Bangalore for $30,000. He had an <b>indifferent</b> 2008 season, {{with a total}} of 165 runs in 12 innings at an average of 15.00 and a strike rate of 105.09. He fared slightly better in the second season in which he made a total of 246 runs at 22.36, striking at over 112, while his team made it as far as the final. In the 2010 season, Kohli was the third highest run-getter for his team with 307 runs, averaging 27.90 and improving his strike rate to 144.81.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as <b>indifferent</b> or even {{favourable}} to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals. Cardinal de Bernis, the nominal leader of the court faction, probably did not play any role in the appointment of Ganganelli and only followed the instructions of Marquis d'Aubeterre when all had been already known.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1929, the Mufti Haj Amin Al Husseinni ordered an opening be made at the {{southern}} end of the alleyway which straddled the Wall. The former cul-de-sac became a thoroughfare which led from the Temple Mount into the prayer area at the Wall. Mules were herded through the narrow alley, often dropping excrement. This, together with other construction projects in the vicinity, and restricted access to the Wall, resulted in Jewish protests to the British, who remained <b>indifferent.</b>|$|E
5|$|Inclined {{to form an}} {{alliance}} with the Habsburgs (and even give up the Polish crown to pursue his ambitions in Sweden), Sigismund conducted secret negotiations with them and married Archduchess Anna. Accused by Zamoyski of breaking his covenants, Sigismund III was humiliated during the sejm of 1592, which deepened his resentment of szlachta. Sigismund was bent on strengthening {{the power of the}} monarchy and Counter-Reformational promotion of the Catholic Church (Piotr Skarga was among his supporters). <b>Indifferent</b> to the increasingly common breaches of the Warsaw Confederation religious protections and instances of violence against the Protestants, the King was opposed by religious minorities.|$|E
5|$|Lewis MacKenzie, in 1992, {{served in}} the Sarajevo {{division}} of United Nations Protection Force which was mandated {{to keep the peace}} in Croatia. Off describes MacKenzie as being <b>indifferent</b> as hostilities began in Sarajevo because his mandate did not include intervention in Bosnian affairs. MacKenzie's distrust of all participants in the hostilities grew following a botched prisoner exchange, the Breadline Massacre, and broken ceasefire arrangements. MacKenzie helped negotiate UN control of the Sarajevo International Airport which allowed humanitarian shipments. MacKenzie gave many media interviews but Off criticizes him for portraying both the Serbs and the Bosnians as aggressors and recommending against intervention.|$|E
5|$|Link and {{his three}} transformations receive {{different}} reactions from non-player characters. For instance, the Goron and Zora are allowed to exit Clock Town at will, whereas the Deku Scrub is not permitted to leave by reason of his childlike appearance. Animals also interact differently with the four forms of Link. For example, Link's normal form receives an <b>indifferent</b> response from dogs, Deku Link is attacked by them, Goron Link frightens them, and Zora Link makes them chase him happily.|$|E
5|$|Lydia wanted Richardson {{to become}} a priest. In Brighton he served as an altar boy, which he enjoyed, but when sent at about fifteen to the nearby Xaverian College, a seminary for trainee priests, he ran away. As a pupil at a series of schools he was uninterested in most {{subjects}} and was an <b>indifferent</b> scholar. His Latin was poor, and during church services he would improvise parts of the Latin responses, developing a talent for invention when memory failed that proved useful in his later career.|$|E
5|$|Princess Charlotte was a {{difficult}} child and <b>indifferent</b> student, with a nervous disposition. Her relationship with her demanding mother was strained. As she grew older, Charlotte developed a penchant for spreading gossip and causing trouble. Eager to escape from parental control, at age sixteen, she married Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Meiningen in 1878. Her husband's weak-willed personality {{had little effect on}} her. Known for spreading gossip and her eccentric personality, Princess Charlotte enjoyed Berlin society while frequently leaving her only child, Princess Feodora, in the care of family members. Charlotte and Feodora, in turn, also had {{a difficult}} relationship.|$|E
5|$|Puccini saw Sardou's {{play when}} it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, {{obtained}} the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered {{at a time of}} unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite <b>indifferent</b> reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public.|$|E
