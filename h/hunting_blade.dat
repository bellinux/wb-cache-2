60|$|He {{snatched}} the <b>hunting</b> <b>blade</b> from his gee-string and thrusting upward drove it once, twice, thrice into the breast above him. The mighty wings fluttered {{a few more}} times, spasmodically, the talons relaxed their hold, and Tarzan of the Apes fell hurtling downward toward the distant jungle.|$|E
60|$|In sudden fury Numa hurled himself {{toward the}} ape-man, but the wiry {{creature}} eluded the blundering charge, side-stepping quickly only to rush in upon his foe. Twice the <b>hunting</b> <b>blade</b> {{flashed in the}} air. Twice it fell upon the back of Numa, already weakening from the spear point so near his heart. The second stroke of the blade pierced far into the beast's spine, and with a last convulsive sweep of the fore-paws, in a vain attempt to reach his tormentor, Numa sprawled upon the ground, paralyzed and dying.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blade's</b> <b>hunt</b> for his mother's killer {{led him to}} Boston, Massachusetts, {{where he}} allied with Dracula against Doctor Sun. Following this battle, Dracula withdrew, and Blade again set out on his own.|$|R
50|$|He {{eventually}} encountered Hannibal King, {{a private}} detective whom Deacon Frost {{had turned into a}} vampire. While initially distrusting King, Blade teamed up with him to <b>hunt</b> Frost. <b>Blade</b> and King fought together against Blade's evil doppelgänger, who absorbed the real Blade. King enlisted the help of Daimon Hellstrom, the so-called Son of Satan, who exorcised Blade from the doppelgänger and killed it with King's help. Blade and King eventually caught up with Frost, who had created an army of vampiric doppelgängers, one for each of his victims. Together, they shut down Frost for good, destroying Frost, and forging a lasting friendship.|$|R
50|$|From {{the oldest}} {{inhabitants}} of the Brazilian territory (horticulturists and hunter-gatherer groups), the museum preserves several artifacts made of stone (flint, quartz and other minerals) and bones, such as projectile points used for <b>hunting,</b> axe <b>blades</b> of polished stone and other tools used for carving, scraping, cleaving, triturating, and piercing, in addition to artifacts of ceremonial use and adornments. Although objects made of wood, fiber, and resin were also produced, {{the majority of them}} didn't {{stand the test of time}} and are almost absent in the collection, except for some individual pieces — namely a woven straw basket covered by resin, only partially preserved, found in the southern coast of Brazil.|$|R
50|$|All weapon classes from {{previous}} games (Great Sword, Long Sword, Sword and Shield, Dual <b>Blades,</b> Hammer, <b>Hunting</b> Horn, Lance, Gunlance, Switch Axe, Light Bowgun, Heavy Bowgun and Bow) {{are present in}} the game. The four classes which were not present in Tri (Dual <b>blades,</b> <b>Hunting</b> Horn, Gunlance and Bow) have been revised. The equipment creation and fortification systems received a variety of changes. Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto claimed that this area of the game will keep what was good from Monster Hunter Freedom Unite and Monster Hunter Tri and add new elements.|$|R
50|$|Abraham Whistler's {{background}} in the animated series {{is the same as}} that in the films, although he appears younger and with a much more kempt appearance than the cinematic interpretation of the character. Whistler was a vampire hunter who took on a young Blade and trained him in martial arts and as a vampire hunter. Blade, who was half-vampire himself, was given a serum developed by Whistler that would stop him from craving human plasma. When <b>Blade</b> <b>hunted</b> Morbius the Living Vampire, a young human student who was accidentally mutated into a vampire-like creature, Blade discovered the Neogenic Recombinator, which could transform humans into vampires. Whistler told him not to destroy it, as it could also be used to cure Blade of his vampirism. Morbius was eventually driven into hibernation.|$|R
50|$|After Elexis Sinclaire {{disappeared}} {{at the end}} of Sin, Wages of Sin {{continues the}} storyline by introducing the new villain Gianni Manero, a mob boss who seeks to gain power from the leftovers of Elexis' former company SinTEK. Manero produces new genetically engineered creatures (mutants) under secret supervision, but when some of these mutants break out and run into the city, the elite security force group HARDCORPS becomes aware of them and it's up to HARDCORPS leader John Blade, who starred as the hero and the player's character in Sin, to set things right. <b>Blade's</b> <b>hunt</b> for Manero leads him to new locations of Freeport City that {{were not included in the}} original game, features new enemies and weapons, and has such interesting story/gameplay elements as the kidnapping of a scientist's daughter and day/night scenarios of the same levels, depending on the player's choice.|$|R
50|$|The {{property}} is well {{over one hundred}} years old, since three generations have lived in this house. Saezima Estate (Saejima-tei)'s actual location is not mentioned, but known {{to be in a}} country area close to the city and up in a hill or mountain. The mansion is destroyed in the final episode of Makai Senki, during Sigma Fudō's attempt to enact revenge on Kouga for thwarting his plans. The new Saezima Estate in Makai no Hana is called the Raimeikan (雷瞑館). Both mansions have a training room armed with gigantic swinging axes for honing fighting skills when not out <b>hunting</b> Horrors. The <b>blades</b> of the axes are made of the fangs from the Grou Dragon meant for hunting Horrors, as such, the Knight would run the risk of being mistaken as a Horror and being attacked ferociously during training, should he forget to go for periodic purification and has too much Horror essence latched onto him.|$|R
5000|$|Noah van Helsing {{appears in}} Marvel Anime: Blade voiced by Osamu Saka in the Japanese version and by Troy Baker in the English dub. In a flashback, {{it was shown}} that Noah van Helsing had his first {{encounter}} with Blade after he helped him save a girl from Baron Howard and his fellow vampires. The next day, Noah van Helsing discovered that Blade wasn't harmed by sunlight. Noah mentioned to Blade {{that he is a}} vampire hunter as Blade revealed that he has been having blood cravings. Blade mentioned that he has been looking for a vampire with four fangs. Noah van Helsing revealed a prototype of the Retro Virus made from the ashes of vampires which causes anyone in his experiments to turn to ashes. Noah decided to test the Retro Virus on Blade since his human DNA had found a way to co-exist with his vampire DNA. Noah stated that if it worked on Blade, he will have to decide what he would do with his second chance at life. The next day, it is shown that Blade had survived the Retro Virus with no blood cravings. Blade then asked for Noah van Helsing to train him how to fight vampires. In the present, Blade runs into Noah van Helsing and his dog Razor as Noah tells him that Deacon Frost is in the Philippines. They take a boat operated by Captain MacRae {{in order to get to}} the Philippines. When Makoto tries to attack Blade, Noah manages to knock down Makoto as Razor licks Makoto. Noah passes Makoto off as a boy. While on the ride to the Philippines, Noah gives Blade a medicine that would help with his condition. Later that night, Makoto tries to slay Blade in his sleep only for Blade to awaken and Noah to remove Makoto from the room. Noah explains to Makoto that Blade is a daywalker vampire and recaps his history with Blade. After Makoto learned of Blade's history, the boat is then attacked by a flock of Mandurugos led by Matthes. Although Blade fends of Matthes causing the Mandurugos to retreat, one of the Mandurugos snatches Noah at the last minute as Blade tells Captain MacRae to continue the course to the Philippines. Noah is then seen tied up in Matthes' mansion when Matthes gets word that Blade is at the slave ship docks. While Matthes leads the Mandurugos to go attack Blade, Makoto and Razor raid Matthes' mansion and rescues Noah. The next morning, Noah van Helsing thanks Blade for saving him and states that he is getting too old for vampire <b>hunting.</b> Noah tells <b>Blade</b> that he heard Matthes stating in a conversation that Deacon Frost has an underground hideout on a remote island. Noah tells Makoto to take Razor and help Blade fight Deacon Frost. In [...] "Eternal Apocalypse," [...] it was revealed that Noah van Helsing was friends with a swordmaster named Tanba Yagyu who trained Blade and the mutant Kikyo Mikage in sword combat. In [...] "Partner," [...] Noah van Helsing arrived in Cambodia to rescue Blade from the Existence facility that Blade is held in. When he finds that Makoto has been bitten by Deacon Frost, Noah stated that he didn't make it in time. After Makoto dies, Noah van Helsing accompanies Blade to the vampire city of Armarot (which is hidden deep within the Golden Triangle) in order to defeat Deacon Frost once and for all. During the battle, Noah van Helsing surveys the battlefield as he detonates the Existence's arsenal. Noah van Helsing and Razor then fight their way towards the blood source as he is targeted by the Mandurugos and the Manananggals until Razor saves him. Noah van Helsing then drops the water used by Agus into Armarot's blood supplies. Following the death of Deacon Frost and the destruction of Armarot, Noah van Helsing tells a truck driver that there is no sign of Blade. Razor barks at Blade's arrival as Noah van Helsing tells Blade that he knew Blade would come through. When Noah van Helsing asks Blade what he'll be doing now that Deacon Frost is gone, Blade vows to continue his quest of exterminating every vampire in the world.|$|R
