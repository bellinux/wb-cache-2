5|$|Human {{activity}} in the lands of modern Bulgaria {{can be traced back}} to the Paleolithic. Animal bones incised with man-made markings from Kozarnika cave are assumed to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans. Organised prehistoric societies in Bulgarian lands include the Neolithic Hamangia culture, Vinča culture and the eneolithic Varna culture (fifth millennium BC). The latter is credited with inventing gold working and exploitation. Some of these first gold smelters produced the coins, weapons and jewellery of the Varna Necropolis treasure, the oldest in the world with an approximate age of over 6,000 years. This site also offers insights for understanding the social <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest European societies.|$|E

Disregarding the Provost's authority, Oriel's Fellows fought bloody battles with other scholars, killed one of the Chancellor's servants when they attacked his house, and were prominent among the group that obstructed the Archbishop and ridiculed his censures.|$|E

The division was not chosen to be part of the Occupation of the Rhineland after the war, and was demobilised over several months. It ceased to exist by March 1919.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{collision}} Prime Minister Menzies ordered a Royal Commission {{to investigate the}} event. The Commissioner concluded that {{the collision}} was primarily the fault of Voyagers bridge crew not maintaining an effective lookout, but also placed blame on Melbournes Captain John Robertson (who resigned shortly after) and two other officers for failing to alert Voyager or take effective measures to avoid collision. The handing of the Royal Commission was seen as poor, and after a combination of public pressure and claims that Stevens had a drinking problem, a second Royal Commission was announced: the only time two Commissions have been held for the same incident. The second Royal Commission found that Stevens was likely medically unfit for command, {{that some of the}} first Commission's conclusions were therefore incorrect, and the Melbourne officers were not at fault. The two commissions caused great anguish in the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> RAN, which was not accustomed to such tight scrutiny, and led to the eventual dismantling of the Naval Board's isolation from the civilian world.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Cold War {{tensions}} between the United States and Soviet Union had escalated to a level {{not seen since the}} Cuban Missile Crisis because of several factors. These included the United States' Strategic Defense Initiative, its planned deployment of the Pershing II weapon system in Europe in March and April, and FleetEx '83, the largest naval exercise held to date in the North Pacific. The military <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union (particularly the old guard led by Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov and Minister of Defence Dmitry Ustinov) viewed these actions as bellicose and destabilizing; they were deeply suspicious of U.S. President Ronald Reagan's intentions and openly fearful he was planning a pre-emptive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. These fears culminated in RYAN, the code name for a secret intelligence-gathering program initiated by Andropov to detect a potential nuclear sneak attack which he believed Reagan was plotting.|$|E
5|$|In the Late Classic period Motul de San José {{was located}} between two {{mutually}} hostile powers, the great city of Tikal {{to the north}} and the breakaway kingdom of Petexbatún to the southwest, which had become a vassal of Tikal's implacable enemy Calakmul. In Mesoamerica, such border states as Motul de San José became centres of political activity as they tried to manipulate the shifting political fortunes of their neighbours to their own advantage. This {{seems to be the case}} at Motul de San José with its rich ceramic tradition being a testament to the politically motivated banqueting that took place in the city. In the 8th century, although Motul de San José was the capital of the Ik polity, the aristocracy of its satellite sites wielded great power and were able to challenge their own position within the political <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> state while remaining subordinate to the ruling lord of the capital city.|$|E

5|$|The Castellania was {{the supreme}} court of justice of the islands, hence called Gran Corte or the {{variants}} in legal documents. The Grand Master had the absolute power to preside over the institution. The Papacy quarreled for a superior decision, such as when there was conflict with the court of the Bishop, but citing sovereignty of the princely Grand Master it was never conceded. With the presence of the Inquisition, the Holy See considered Malta similar to a colony, but through the Castellania the Order kept rigid control and sovereignty over Malta. Though the Inquisition had the power to issue a death penalty in cases related to religion, such as heresy, fornication and sodomy, it generally left it at the discretion of the Castellania. In its time, the Castellania was considered to be a secular court, and the law was amended with the issue of a Bando by the Grand Master. In military context the knights were not subject to the Castellania, and were instead prosecuted at the Military Tribunal (Tribunale Militare), however it received assistance from the higher <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Castellania such as from the judge of the criminal court.|$|E
5|$|In March 1814, {{following}} {{with the}} collapse of the First French Empire, Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes—had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Spanish Catholic Church; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain.|$|E
5|$|There {{were growing}} {{divisions}} between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party. While Evangelicals emphasised {{the authority of}} the Bible and the traditions and historical documents of the kirk, the Moderates tended to stress intellectualism in theology, the established <b>hierarchy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kirk and attempted to raise the social status of the clergy. From the 1760s the Moderates gained an ascendancy in the General Assembly of the Church. They were led by the historian William Robertson (1721–93), who became principal of the University of Edinburgh and then by his successor George Hill (1750–1819), who was professor at the University of Aberdeen. Evangelical leaders included John Willison (1680–1750), John McLaurin (1693–1754) and Alexander Webster (1707–84). The most important figure was John Erskine (1721–1803), who was minister of Old Greyfriars Church in Edinburgh from 1768 and for 26 years a friend and colleague to Robertson. He was orthodox in doctrine, but sympathised with the Enlightenment and supported reforms in religious practice. A popular preacher, he corresponded with religious leaders in other countries, including New England theologian Johnathan Edwards (1703–58), whose ideas were a major influence on the movement in Scotland. Judged by the number of books printed in Scotland, Boston was the most popular theological writer in the movement.|$|E
