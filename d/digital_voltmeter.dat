5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a <b>Digital</b> <b>Voltmeter</b> so he attempted to appeal to kit builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E
25|$|A {{voltmeter}} is {{an instrument}} used for measuring {{electrical potential difference}} between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale {{in proportion to the}} voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by use of an analog to digital converter.

In 1972, Texas Instruments developed its own calculator chip and started selling complete calculators at less than half the price of other commercial models. MITS and many other companies were devastated by this, and Roberts struggled to reduce his quarter-million-dollar debt.|$|E

25|$|For a decade, colleges had {{required}} {{science and}} engineering majors to take a course in computer programming, typically using the FORTRAN or BASIC languages. This meant there was a sizable customer base who knew about computers. In 1970, electronic calculators were not seen outside of a laboratory, but by 1974 they were a common household item. Calculators and video games like Pong introduced computer power to the general public. Electronics hobbyists were moving on to digital projects such as <b>digital</b> <b>voltmeters</b> and frequency counters.

These hands-on teaching workshops had a variety of test equipment used to repair televisions and radios, including oscilloscopes, voltmeters and signal generators. Several electronics labs were used to teach analog and digital electronics; these labs were equipped with electronic test equipment such as multiple-trace oscilloscopes, <b>digital</b> <b>voltmeters</b> and microcomputers.

The typical uncertainty in measurements of 10 V Zener standards is limited by noise in the Zener to about 0.01 ppm. The ability to set the Josephson array to a wide range of discrete voltages also makes it the most accurate tool for measuring the linearity of high-accuracy <b>digital</b> <b>voltmeters.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} focused on the use of data {{acquisition}} boards (DAQs) for the development of high accuracy PC-based instruments for the measurements of electrical power. The proposed systems are simple, portable and low cost because they are based on commercial data acquisition boards (DAQs) connected to a common personal computer. Data processing is carried out by a commercial software based on an interpolating windowed FFT. In the paper it is shown how the voltage can be sensed directly, thanks to the DAQ input range, thus avoiding expensive voltage dividers. The set up of the DAQs-based solutions is described and the evaluation of their metrological features is made by means of a comparison with the Italian power primary standard, which was built at INRIM with a complex solution and expensive with two high precision <b>digital</b> <b>voltmeters...</b>|$|R
50|$|Digital ammeter designs use a shunt {{resistor}} {{to produce a}} calibrated voltage proportional to the current flowing. This voltage is then measured by a <b>digital</b> <b>voltmeter,</b> through use of an {{analog to digital converter}} (ADC); the digital display is calibrated to display the current through the shunt. Such instruments are often calibrated to indicate the RMS value for a sine wave only, but many designs will indicate true RMS within limitations of the wave crest factor.|$|E
50|$|The {{four-wire}} resistance configuration {{increases the}} accuracy of measurement of resistance. Four-terminal sensing eliminates voltage drop in the measuring leads as a contribution to error. To increase accuracy further, any residual thermoelectric voltages generated by different wire types or screwed connections are eliminated by reversal of {{the direction of the}} 1 mA current and the leads to the DVM (<b>digital</b> <b>voltmeter).</b> The thermoelectric voltages will be produced in one direction only. By averaging the reversed measurements, the thermoelectric error voltages are cancelled out.|$|E

50|$|An {{integrating}} ADC (also dual-slope or multi-slope ADC) {{applies the}} unknown input voltage to {{the input of}} an integrator and allows the voltage to ramp for a fixed time period (the run-up period). Then a known reference voltage of opposite polarity {{is applied to the}} integrator and is allowed to ramp until the integrator output returns to zero (the run-down period). The input voltage is computed {{as a function of the}} reference voltage, the constant run-up time period, and the measured run-down time period. The run-down time measurement is usually made in units of the converter's clock, so longer integration times allow for higher resolutions. Likewise, the speed of the converter can be improved by sacrificing resolution. Converters of this type (or variations on the concept) are used in most <b>digital</b> <b>voltmeters</b> for their linearity and flexibility.|$|R
50|$|The {{peak-to-peak}} value is used, for example, when choosing rectifiers for power supplies, or when estimating the maximum voltage that insulation must withstand. Some common voltmeters are calibrated for RMS amplitude, but {{respond to the}} average value of a rectified waveform. Many <b>digital</b> <b>voltmeters</b> and all moving coil meters are in this category. The RMS calibration is only correct for a sine wave input since the ratio between peak, average and RMS values is dependent on waveform. If the wave shape being measured is greatly different from a sine wave, the relationship between RMS and average value changes. True RMS-responding meters were used in radio frequency measurements, where instruments measured the heating effect in a resistor to measure current. The advent of microprocessor controlled meters capable of calculating RMS by sampling the waveform has made true RMS measurement commonplace.|$|R
40|$|The NCP 431 /NCP 432 {{integrated}} circuits are three−terminal programmable shunt regulator diodes.

These devices exhibit a wide operating current range of 40 �A to 100 mA with a typical dynamic impedance of 0. 22 �. The characteristics of these references make them excellent replacements for zener diodes in many applications such as <b>digital</b> <b>voltmeters,</b> power supplies, and op amp circuitry. The 2. 5 V reference makes it convenient to obtain a stable reference from 5. 0 V logic supplies, and since the NCP 431 / NCP 432 operates as a shunt regulator, {{it can be used}} as either a positive or negative voltage reference. Low minimum operating current makes this device an ideal choice for secondary regulators in SMPS adapters with extremely low no−load consumption...|$|R
