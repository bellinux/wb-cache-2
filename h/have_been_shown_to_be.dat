5|$|Neurostimulation may {{be another}} option in {{those who are not}} {{candidates}} for surgery. Three types <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> effective in those who do not respond to medications: vagus nerve stimulation, anterior thalamic stimulation, and closed-loop responsive stimulation.|$|E
5|$|Tasmanian forms <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> frost {{tolerant}} at {{any time}} of year, which might explain some of their success in spreading and growing in different habitats around the island. This attribute might have allowed them to survive cold periods in Tasmania in the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|These sharp limits {{from the}} non-observation {{of the effects}} caused by the galactic vector {{potential}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> model dependent. If the photon mass is generated via the Higgs mechanism then the upper limit of m≲10−14eV/c2 from the test of Coulomb's law is valid.|$|E
5000|$|PDE inhibition: Other bitter {{compounds}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> inhibit PDE. Bacitracin and hydrochloride <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> inhibit PDE in bovine taste tissue ...|$|R

50|$|NFIX <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with SKI protein {{and it is}} also known to {{interact with}} AP-1. NFI-X3 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> interact with STAT3.|$|R
5|$|Although {{there are}} at least three staging systems for cholangiocarcinoma (e.g. those of Bismuth, Blumgart, and the American Joint Committee on Cancer), none <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful in {{predicting}} survival. The most important staging issue is whether the tumor can be surgically removed, or whether it is too advanced for surgical treatment to be successful. Often, this determination can only be made at the time of surgery.|$|E
5|$|Plumes from Enceladus, {{which are}} similar in {{composition}} to comets, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the source of the}} material in Saturn's E ring. The E ring is the widest and outermost ring of Saturn (except for the tenuous Phoebe ring). It is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan.|$|E
5|$|Some probiotics <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{beneficial}} in reducing both {{the duration of}} illness {{and the frequency of}} stools. They may also be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly beneficial. Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.|$|E
40|$|Cycloheximide {{accumulation}} in a fermentation medium <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the product}} of the balance between synthesis and degradation of this antibiotic. Glucose <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> prevent cycloheximide degradation. Cycloheximide <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> interfere with its own synthesis probably due to feedback inhibition. Approaches for increasing cycloheximide titers in the light of these findings are discussed...|$|R
50|$|GLUT4 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with death-associated protein 6, {{also known as}} Daxx. Daxx, which is used <b>to</b> regulate apoptosis, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> associate with GLUT4 in the cytoplasm. UBX-domains, {{such as the one}} found in GLUT4, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> associate with apoptotic signaling. So this interaction aids in the translocation of Daxx within the cell.|$|R
50|$|The {{olfactory}} tubercle <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> play a {{large role}} in behavior. Unilateral lesions in the olfactory tubercle <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> alter attention, social and sensory responsiveness, and even locomotor behavior. Bilateral lesions <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> reduce copulatory behavior in male rats. The olfactory tubercle <b>has</b> also <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> especially involved in reward and addictive behaviors. Rats <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle more than the nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, other reward centers in the brain. In fact, they will administer cocaine into the olfactory tubercle at about 200 times per hour and even till death.|$|R
5|$|TgPVR21 mice have {{incorporated}} the human PVR at chromosome 13. These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because they express decreased levels of hPVR. TgPVR21 mice <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> susceptible to poliovirus infection through intranasal inoculation, and may be useful as a mucosal infection model.|$|E
5|$|Tree sparrows {{are also}} subject to {{bacterial}} and viral infections. Bacteria <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{an important factor}} in the failure of eggs to hatch and in nestling mortality, and mass deaths due to Salmonella infection have been noted in Japan. Avian malaria parasites have been found in the blood of many populations, and birds in China were found to harbour a strain of H5N1 that was highly virulent to chickens.|$|E
5|$|Vector control {{refers to}} {{methods used to}} {{decrease}} malaria by reducing the levels of transmission by mosquitoes. For individual protection, the most effective insect repellents are based on DEET or picaridin. Insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly effective in preventing malaria among children in areas where malaria is common. Prompt treatment of confirmed cases with artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) may also reduce transmission.|$|E
5000|$|Beta-actin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{activate}} eNOS, {{thereby increasing}} NO production. An eight-amino acid residue (326-333) in actin <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> mediate {{the interaction between}} actin and eNOS ...|$|R
50|$|Cells with CCS mutants <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> display ALS like symptoms. Moreover, SOD1 mutants {{that have}} altered {{interactions}} with CCS <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> display misfolding and aggregation.|$|R
50|$|Bub3 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> form {{complexes}} with Mad1-Bub1 {{and with}} Cdc20 (the interaction of {{which does not}} require intact kinetochores). Additionally, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> bind Mad2 and Mad3. Bub3 directs the localization of Bub1 at the kinetochore in order to activate the SAC. In both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and metazoans, Bub3 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>show</b> <b>to</b> bind BubR1 and Bub1.|$|R
5|$|Another early {{application}} of functional graphs {{is in the}} trains used to study Steiner triple systems. The train of a triple system is a functional graph having a vertex for each possible triple of symbols; each triple pqr is mapped by ƒ to stu, where pqs, prt, and qru are the triples that belong to the triple system and contain the pairs pq, pr, and qr respectively. Trains <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a powerful invariant of triple systems although somewhat cumbersome to compute.|$|E
5|$|Baculoviruses are {{specific}} to individual insect host species and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful in biological pest control. For example, the Lymantria dispar multicapsid nuclear polyhedrosis virus {{has been used to}} spray large areas of forest in North America where larvae of the gypsy moth are causing serious defoliation. The moth larvae are killed by the virus they have eaten and die, the disintegrating cadavers leaving virus particles on the foliage to infect other larvae.|$|E
5|$|Hot Jupiters, due {{to their}} extreme proximities to their host stars, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> losing their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets. These planets may have vast {{differences}} in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds, although {{the day and night}} sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.|$|E
50|$|TNIK <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with KIAA0090, although the significance <b>is</b> unclear. TNIK <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> phosphorylate Gelsolin, a protein involved in F-actin depolymerisation thus inducing cytoskeletal changes.|$|R

50|$|Bacteria proteins, {{also known}} as effectors, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> use AMPylation. Effectors such as VopS, IbpA, and DrrA, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> AMPylate host GTPases and cause actin {{cytoskeleton}} changes.|$|R
5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> continuously collinear, meaning {{that they have been}} shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
5|$|Monomethylhydrazine, {{as well as}} its {{precursors}} methylformylhydrazine and gyromitrin and raw Gyromitra esculenta, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carcinogenic {{in experimental}} animals. Although Gyromitra esculenta has not been observed to cause cancer in humans, it is possible there is a carcinogenic risk for people who ingest these types of mushrooms. The toxins may be cumulative and even small amounts may have a carcinogenic effect. At least 11 different hydrazines have been isolated from Gyromitra esculenta, and it is not known if the potential carcinogens can be completely removed by parboiling.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species are}} generalist predators, eating microalgae, sponges, bivalves, snails {{and other small}} animals. The crown-of-thorns starfish consumes coral polyps, while other species are detritivores, feeding on decomposing organic {{material}} and faecal matter. A few are suspension feeders, gathering in phytoplankton; Henricia and Echinaster often occur in association with sponges, benefiting from the water current they produce. Various species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form {{a significant portion of}} their diet.|$|E
50|$|TNRC6B <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with EIF2C2. It {{is also known}} to associate with argonaute proteins and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> required for miRNA-guided gene silencing in HeLa cells.|$|R
5|$|Strontium <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> inhibit sensory {{irritation}} {{when applied}} topically to the skin. Topically applied, strontium <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> accelerate the recovery {{rate of the}} epidermal permeability barrier (skin barrier).|$|R
50|$|In one study, symhedonia (experiencing empathic joy) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{more closely}} {{associated}} with allophilia, while sympathy (experiencing empathic sorrow) <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more strongly associated with prejudice.|$|R
5|$|Some Hydnellum species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{in decline}} in Europe, {{including}} the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Norway, and Scotland. In the United Kingdom, several {{are listed in}} the biodiversity action plan for stiped hydnoid fungi: H. aurantiacum is classified as critically endangered; H. caeruleum, H. ferrugineum are listed as endangered, while H. concrescens, H. spongiosipes, H. peckii, and H. scrobiculatum are considered vulnerable. H. ferrugineum and H. peckii are sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear-cutting, a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} Stegosaurus is uncertain, as few remains of basal stegosaurs and their {{ancestors}} are known. Recently, stegosaurids <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{present in the}} lower Morrison Formation, existing several million years before the occurrence of Stegosaurus itself, {{with the discovery of}} the related Hesperosaurus from the early Kimmeridgian. The earliest stegosaurid (the genus Lexovisaurus) is known from the Oxford Clay Formation of England and France, giving it an age of early to middle Callovian.|$|E
5|$|The two {{ecotypes}} of {{the common}} bottlenose dolphin within the western North Atlantic are represented by the shallower water or coastal ecotype and the more offshore ecotype. Their ranges overlap, but they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> genetically distinct. They are not currently described, however, as separate species or subspecies. In general, genetic variation between populations is significant, even among nearby populations. As {{a result of this}} genetic variation, other distinct species currently considered to be populations of common bottlenose dolphin are possible.|$|E
50|$|Many angiostatic factors <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> {{counteract}} {{the effect of}} increasing local VEGF. The naturally occurring form of soluble Flt-1 <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>shown</b> <b>to</b> reverse neovascularization in rats, mice, and monkeys.|$|R
