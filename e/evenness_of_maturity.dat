40|$|Using donor-controlled, {{bottom-up}} equations {{to describe}} network collapse we systematically investigate the impact each species {{has on the}} survival or extinction of other species. Short of extinction, one can determine the integrated losses experienced by the ecosystem. These losses are aggregated into system level indicators, such as entropy, average gain/loss, average time to extinction, etc. The methodology is applied to 18 ecological flow networks available in the literature. We calculate the correlations between various indicators and determine high positive correlation between: number of nodes & maximal trophic level; connectedness & average entropy losses; number of nodes & average number of extinct nodes; and, maximum trophic level & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> links. A high negative correlation was found between: number of nodes & connectedness; connectedness & maximal trophic level; maximum tropic level & average entropy loss; and, connectedness & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> flows. Lastly, a low correlation was found between: average number of extinct compartments & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> flows; number <b>of</b> nodes & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> stocks; and, <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> flows & <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> stocks...|$|R

40|$|Merapi volcano {{as one of}} {{national}} park is an ecotourism site which is very potential to visit. Information about species diversity for a national park is very important especially if its area fluctuated susceptibly. Two years after 2010 Merapi eruption, there are no research about species diversity and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> Anuran in that place. The research is carried out during June-November 2012 which is dry season. The objective {{of this research is}} to study the species diversity and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> Anuran in southern slope of Mount Merapi. The research is carried out in 6 locations; those are Kali Kuning, Telogo Muncar, Telogo Nirmolo, Petak Pitu, Bukit Turgo, and Bukit Plawangan. We used Visual Encounter Survey (VES) method combined with transect in Kali Kuning, Telogo Muncar, and Petak Pitu. VES method combined with time search in Telogo Nirmolo and Bukit Turgo. VES method combined with track exploration in Bukit Plawangan. Species diversity is analyzed with Shanon-Wiener diversity index. Species evenness is analyzed with Pielou evenness index. Total individuals each species is counted to know species abundance. Species diversity of anuran in southern slope of Mount Merapi is consisted of 12 species’ which is distributed in 6 locations. The highest diversity and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> anuran is at Bukit Turgo (H’= 1. 31; E= 0. 94). The lowest diversity and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> anuran is at Petak Pitu (H’= 0. 49; E= 0. 3). Species diversity of anuran in southern slope of Mount Merapi is low (Bukit Turgo and Kali Kuning) and very low (Bukit Plawangan, Telogo Muncar, Telogo Nirmolo, and Petak Pitu).

40|$|The Juvenile Hormone {{analogue}} s-methoprene is used {{to protect}} stored grain from pests such as the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.). The possibility that uneven application influences s-methoprene efficacy against this species was investigated in the laboratory. Adults of methoprene-susceptible strains were exposed for 14 days to wheat treated at doses of up to 0. 6 mg kg- 1, or to mixtures of treated and untreated wheat giving equivalent average doses. Adult mortality after exposure to treated wheat was negligible in all cases (3. 3 %) {{and there was no}} significant effect of either average dose or <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application. In contrast, the number of adult progeny depended on both the average dose and <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application. Average doses of 0. 3 and 0. 6 mg kg- 1 reduced the number of live F 1 adults by 99 - 100 % relative to the untreated wheat and no effect <b>of</b> <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application was detected. At lower doses, however, efficacy tended to decrease with increasing unevenness of application. When adults from the parental generation were transferred to untreated wheat for another 14 days neither the average dose nor <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> application in the wheat from which they came had any significant effect on reproduction of these adults. This study demonstrates that uneven application can reduce the efficacy of s-methoprene against R. dominica, but that this is unlikely to influence the performance of s-methoprene against susceptible populations at target doses likely to be used in practice (e. g. 0. 6 mg kg- 1 in Australia). However, the possibility that uneven application leads to underdosing and selects for resistance should be investigated...|$|R

Analyzing the couch potato audience of all matches during the FIFA World Cup 2006 in Switzerland, we find strong evidence that the TV ratings are highly affected by the size of the groups of foreign residents affiliated to the teams playing on the field.

40|$|Despite the {{importance}} of Arctic soils in the global carbon cycle, we know {{very little of the}} impacts of warming on the soil microbial communities that drive carbon and nutrient cycling in these ecosystems. Over a 2 -year period, we monitored the structure of soil fungal and bacterial communities in organic and mineral soil horizons in plots warmed by greenhouses for 18 years and in control plots. We found that microbial communities were stable over time but strongly structured by warming. Warming led to significant reductions in the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> bacterial communities, while the <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> fungal communities increased significantly. These patterns were strongest in the organic horizon, where temperature change was greatest and were associated with {{a significant increase in the}} dominance of the Actinobacteria and significant reductions in the Gemmatimonadaceae and the Proteobacteria. Greater <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> the fungal community with warming was associated with significant increases in the ectomycorrhizal fungi, Russula spp., Cortinarius spp., and members of the Helotiales suggesting that increased growth of the shrub Betula nana was an important mechanism driving this change.

40|$|Deep litter manure {{contains}} considerable {{amounts of}} plant nutrients {{and is therefore}} used as a fertiliser in crop production. However, the manurial value of deep litter manure is reduced by ammonia volatilisation and uneven land spreading. Although storage before spreading may improve the spreading <b>evenness</b> <b>of</b> deep litter manure, it may also influence the potential for ammonia losses. A study was therefore designed to investigate how storage of deep litter ma-nure influences spreading evenness and ammonia volatilisation following land spreading.
