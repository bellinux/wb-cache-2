5|$|By {{the late}} 1970s, however, Sinclair Radionics was {{experiencing}} serious difficulties. It lost {{its ability to}} compete <b>effectively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> calculator market following the launch {{of a new generation}} of Japanese-produced calculators with liquid crystal displays, which were much more capable and power-efficient than Sinclair's LED calculators. Projects to develop a pocket television and digital watch turned out to be expensive failures. The company made losses of more than £350,000 in 1975–76, bringing it to the edge of bankruptcy. In July 1977 Radionics was rescued by a state agency, the National Enterprise Board (NEB), which recapitalised it, provided a loan facility and took effective control of the company by acquiring a 73% stake.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality at {{the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too <b>effectively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. The threat from these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Doria, {{named for}} the 16th century Genoese admiral of the same name, was laid down at the La Spezia {{shipyard}} in Naples on 24 March 1912. She was launched on 30 March 1913 and completed by 13 March 1916. The Austro-Hungarian Navy, which had been Italy's primary rival for decades, was the primary opponent in the conflict. The Austro-Hungarian battle fleet lay in its harbors directly across the narrow Adriatic Sea and did not emerge {{for the duration of}} the conflict. In addition, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too <b>effectively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.|$|E

5|$|As at Northampton, Chapman's tactics {{were based}} upon the {{principles}} of a strong defence and a fast, counter-attacking response, with the focus on quick, short passing and mazy runs from his wingers, who would pass low inside the defence instead of crossing from the byline. He had been granted control of all footballing affairs at the club and made this responsibility work to his advantage, encouraging the club's reserve and third teams to play the same style of football so that their players would function <b>effectively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first team if selected. He employed a wide-ranging scouting network {{to find the right}} players for his tactical system. Bolstered by the money from the cup run, Chapman was able to make further signings such as goalkeeper Ted Taylor and forward Charlie Wilson (later to be joined by George Cook).|$|E
5|$|Both battleships were {{completed}} after Italy entered World War I {{on the side}} of the Triple Entente, though neither saw action, since Italy's principal naval opponent, the Austro-Hungarian Navy, largely remained in port for the duration of the war. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate <b>effectively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS torpedo boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.

5|$|By then, MacLaren was in {{financial}} difficulties. As an amateur, his expenses {{were covered by}} the tour organisers but he received no money for playing. To support him financially, the Lancashire committee had given him £100 before the tour. By the latter stages of the tour, his money was running out; {{most of it was}} probably spent betting on horse races, and he sent Lancashire a request for further money. Just before the final Test, he received a £60 advance on his expenses for the upcoming English season. For the fifth Test, he dropped down from opening the batting, which he had done throughout the series, to batting at number five, and responded with his first Test century. Batting with greater caution than usual, he scored 120 before accidentally standing on his own wicket. England won the match to take the series 3–2, amid great public interest in England and Australia. MacLaren scored 240 runs at 26.67 in the Test series, finishing fourth in the English averages. He performed more <b>effectively</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lesser matches, and following some final tour fixtures, he totalled 803 runs at 47.23 in all first-class games. On the six-week outward journey MacLaren met (Kathleen) Maud Power, an Australian socialite and the daughter of a horse racing official. They were married in 1898.|$|E

5|$|Caio Duilio {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Regio Cantieri di Castellammare di Stabia on 24 February 1912. She was {{launched}} on 24 April 1913, and completed on 10 May 1916.

5|$|Conte di Cavour, {{named after}} the statesman Count Camillo Benso di Cavour, was laid down at La Spezia Arsenale, La Spezia, on 10 August 1910, and {{launched}} on 10 August 1911.

5|$|Marsalas keel {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Castellammare {{shipyard}} on 15 February 1911, {{the same day as}} Nino Bixio. Work on Marsala proceeded slower than on her sister, and she was launched on 24 March 1912, where she was named for the city where Giuseppe Garibaldi launched the Expedition of the Thousand in 1860. After completing fitting-out work, the ship was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 4 August 1914. Italy declared neutrality at the start of World War I in August 1914, but by May 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers.
