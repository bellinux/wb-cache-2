40|$|This paper {{presents}} a freehand, sketch-based interface for Computed Aided Design (CAD) engineering design and finite element analysis. After a user sketches a two <b>dimensional</b> <b>sketch</b> consisting of connected straight and curved strokes, the sketch is processed by two optimization-based reconstruction algorithms that can reconstruct sketches of 3 D objects {{made up of}} straight lines and planar curves. The proposed implementation allows certain types of objects with over 50 strokes to be reconstructed in interactive time. Following reconstruction, the structural properties of the 3 D shape can be examined using finite element analysis. The object can quickly be modified using the pen-based interface according {{to the results of}} the analysis. The combination of a rapid, sketch-based design interface and finite element analysis allows users to iteratively design, analyze and modify 3 D objects in an intuitive and flexible way.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an innovative participatory method to visualize, discuss {{and analyze the}} power of different actors in a given governance field. The Power Mapping Tool was first {{used to analyze the}} governance effects of Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) in Namibia. This example is presented as a case study to show how the method works: The actors involved are represented by board game figures that are characterized through “range-of-action-cards” and put on wooden “power towers” to show their power in the governance field. The result is a three <b>dimensional</b> <b>sketch</b> that provides quantitative data and guides the qualitative discussion about reasons for and effects of the power of different actors. In the case of Namibian CBNRM Power Mapping helped to understand how power indeed had been devolved from the national to the local level. However, on the community level elite-capture was seen as a serious problem. In this research the Power Mapping Tool proved to be easy to use with a very diverse mix of interview partners and provided not only a wealth of data but also increased the interviewees' understanding of their own situation.

40|$|Recently, Marr and Poggio (1979) {{presented}} {{a theory of}} human stereo vision. An implementation of that theory is {{presented a}}nd consists of five steps: (1) The left and right images are each filtered with masks of four sizes that increase with eccentricity; the shape of these masks is given by $ abla^{ 2 }G$, the laplacian of a gaussian function. (2) Zero-crossing in the filtered images are found along horizontal scan lines. (3) For each mask size, matching takes place between zero-crossings of the same sign and roughly the same orientation in the two images, {{for a range of}} disparities up to about the width of the mask's central region. Within this disparity range, Marr and Poggio showed that false targets pose only a simple problem. (4) The output of the wide masks can control vergence movements, thus causing small masks to come into low resolution to dealing with small disparities at a high resolution. (5) When a correspondence is achieved, it is stored in a dynamic buffer, called the 2 1 / 2 <b>dimensional</b> <b>sketch.</b> To support the sufficiency of the Marr-Poggio model of human stereo vision, the implementation was tested {{on a wide range of}} stereograms from the human stereopsis literature. The performance of the implementation is illustrated and compared with human perception. As well, statistical assumptions made by Marr and Poggio are supported by comparison with statistics found in practice. Finally, the process of implementing the theory has led to the clarification and refinement of a number of details within the theory; these are discussed in detail...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an intuitive, freehand sketching application for Computed Aided Design (CAD) that can reconstruct a 3 D object from a single, flat, freehand sketch. A pen {{is used to}} draw two <b>dimensional</b> <b>sketches</b> consisting of straight and curved strokes connected at vertices. The sketches are processed by a reconstruction algorithm that uses the angular distribution of the strokes, and their connectivity, to determine an orthogonal 3 D axis system whose projection correlates with the observed stroke orientations. The axis system is used to determine a plausible depth for each vertex. This approach works well for drawings of objects whose edges predominantly conform to some overall orthogonal axis system. A second, independent optimization procedure is then used to reconstruct each curved stroke in the original sketch, assuming that the curve is planar. New strokes can {{be attached to the}} 3 D object, or drawn directly onto the object’s faces. An implementation of the reconstruction algorithm based on Levenberg-Marquardt optimization allows objects with over 50 strokes to be reconstructed in interactive time.

40|$|This {{engineering}} note contains {{information about}} the measured clearances along the chimney route from the solenoid to the control dewar. This type of information is best conveyed by sketches and a few photos. Twelve photos taken on 2 / 17 / 94 are included which gIVe perspective views along the path. The detector was parked in the collision hall on this date. The CF iron was split open {{to the east and}} the South EF iron was rolled back. Also the South EndCap Calorimeter was rolled to the south on this day. This allowed personnel access and the photographic opportunity. A full set of raw <b>dimensional</b> <b>sketches</b> are included. These sketches were generated by me using a 25 foot tape measure and a note pad. The sketches are in chronological order with the most recent on top. The first sketch, 5 / 18 / 94, describes the 'tightest' location for the upward incline portion of the chimney. The sketches on 2 / 14 / 94 thru 2 / 16 / 94 are refinements of the early 1992 and 1993 sketches. They pick out quite a bit more detail of specific detector components along the path. The <b>dimensional</b> <b>sketches</b> of 1992 and 1993 gave information in not as much detail and therefore gave a more constrained clearance description. Most of the information of the early sketches was jotted down on the plan view dated 10 - 29 - 92. This sketch also had some information lifted from prints which later was superseded by the 1994 sketches. I tried to label components and give views either titled 'Elevation' or 'Plan' which refers to a top view looking down. Also where I could I jotted down direction, ie. South, East etc. Hopefully with a little effort one can decifer it. The curvature of the CC was determined from a three dimensional topographical survey. This survey information is stored in an electronic drawing file 3823. 111 -ME- 317165, 'Solenoid-CC south face 3 D shape survey'. The 'z' dimensions for the radial chimney path were picked off this drawing. A curvature was then generated knowing many points by radial and z coordinates. This curve is stored in drawing file 3823. 111 -ME 317164, 'Solenoid-CC south face-chimney contour layout'. All drawings mentioned above are kept in hard copy form in the D-Zero drawing files. The electronic 'master' copy is kept in the XDCS drawing control system, dOms vault. The information contained in this engineering note could be very useful for those who are interested in the clearances and shape of the solenoid chimney path. It could even be of use to future designers and engineers involved with the VLPC project which is planned...|$|R

40|$|Dealing with {{narratives}} {{relating to}} corporeal vulnerabilities, sinew II {{is in part}} initially a response to bone-like ceramic fragments and edges. My intention was to redefine and rearrange broken ceramic ware, using cast glass to extend and exaggerate anatomical references and to unite these forms in a new configuration. My process of making is a pursuit of a personal material language and purposeful ‘rough workmanship’. In order to realise the glass cast I employed digital technologies whilst maintaining a low-tech response to composition and an awkwardness of form. 3 D scans of ceramic edges and CAD software were utilised to generate the investment mould for glass casting. This was printed using a 3 D digital printer; this process is known as Rapid Tooling and removes {{the need for a}} physical pattern. Digital processes were employed alongside conventional exploratory means; for example, clay and plaster props were used to roughly mock up 3 <b>dimensional</b> <b>sketches</b> of potential compositions of the broken ceramics. The orientation of physical objects was then recorded using a microscribe, a gestural piece of kit that integrates the engagement between the physical and CAD software. By aligning cross- reference positions recorded using the microscribe with the scanned ceramic data I could sweep between these points to create 3 D pathways that would eventually form the surface of the glass cast. This is an intuitive way of employing digital tools, with unpredictable results. I have deliberately used basic construction methods and sheet glass to maintain immediacy with the materials, and hewn edges to suggest danger and vulnerability. Sinew II, supported by a critical commentary relevant to the conference theme of Materiality, was peer reviewed and included in the exhibition All Makers Now? at Trelissick House, Cornwall. Selected for the International Glass Prize 2015 at Glazenhuis, Lommel, Belgium.

As such, it sheds light on the extent to which the pictorial imaginary of Pedro unavoidably distinguishes itself from the New State context...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} the industrialization {{of a newly}} developed household machine on behalf of Technogarden Engineering Resources in Karlstad, Sweden. The report {{is a part of}} the final course in the Bachelor Program in Mechanical Engineering at Karlstad University and takes place in spring 2014. An innovator, an investor and a engineering consultant firm have through collaboration developed a new type of gruel machine. The product is in its final stage of construction and is planned to be manufactured in a production located in Sweden, autumn of 2014. To compete against today’s trend in outsourcing manufacturing to low cost countries for better profitability, the industrialization of the gruel machine must be done with a minimum amount of resources in order to become successful, which also describes the problem of this study. Using pre-study material in form of Lean production literature, visiting a successful production site and gathering data from involved engineers a specification was developed which describes what this industrialization must achieve and which requests can be accomplished. The specification involves the main questions such as capacity in number of gruel machines produced in a certain amount of time, ergonomics and how to achieve equal product quality. A comprehensive product study has been done to identify how the machine is meant to be assembled where the focus was to analyze timing, identifying item groups and assembly sequence. Six concepts on different factory layouts were created using two <b>dimensional</b> <b>sketches</b> of the actual plant chosen for the machine. The sketches show visual layouts of how the production equipment can be physically arranged in order to assemble the machine. The concepts are then assessed according to a valuation schedule in which the main factors are arranged and an engineering assessment is made of how well the different concepts satisfy these factors. From the valuation schedule the concepts obtain a score and the concept with the highest score wins. The winning concept was worked further on by developing a detailed layout using software Google Sketchup. Using the detailed layout a cost-estimation was made on the manufacturing equipment needed. The results of the study show that the gruel machine best is assembled together in a continuous production in form of a line layout. The assembly process is done by operators manually distributed among four stations equipped with materials via rack of items. Two of these layouts are required to meet the market demand at 20 000 gruel machines a year. An exact sizing of commodity and finished inventories could not be determined because of underdetermined suppliers and deliveries...|$|R

40|$|Product {{development}} is seeing {{a paradigm shift}} {{in the form of}} a simulation-driven approach. Recently, companies and designers have started to realize that simulation has the biggest impact when used as a concept verification tool in early stages of design. Early stage simulation tools like ANSYSTMDesign Space and SIMULIATMDesignSight Structure help to overcome the limitations in traditional product development processes where analyses are carried out by a separate group and not the designers. Most of these commercial tools still require well defined solid models as input and do not support freehand sketches, an integral part of the early design stage of product development. To this extent, we present APIX (acronym for Analysis from Pixellated Inputs), a tool for quick analysis of two <b>dimensional</b> mechanical <b>sketches</b> and parts from their static images using a pen-based interface. The input to the system can be offline (paper) sketches and diagrams, which include scanned legacy drawings and freehand sketches. In addition, images of twodimensional projections of three dimensional mechanical parts can also be input. We have developed an approach to extract a set of boundary contours to represent a pixellated image using known image processing algorithms. The idea is to convert the input images to online sketches and use existing stroke-based recognition techniques for further processing. The converted sketch can now be edited, segmented, recognized, merged, solved ∗ Address all correspondence to this author. for geometric constraints, beautified and used as input for finite element analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the early design process with examples. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} the major result on categoricity in Lω 1,ω, {{placing it in}} the context of more general work in abstract elementary classes. In particular, we illustrate the role of higher <b>dimensional</b> amalgamations and <b>sketch</b> the role of a weak extension of ZFC in the proof. We expound the translation of the problem to studying atomic models of first order theories. We provide a simple example of the failure of amalgamation for a complete sentence of Lω 1,ω. We prove some basic results on the absoluteness of various concepts in the model theory of Lω 1,ω and publicize the problem of absoluteness of ℵ 1 -categoricity in this context.

40|$|This thesis paper articulates the ideas, {{creative}} approach, {{and methodology}} {{with regard to}} the visual component of my thesis project. As a painter, I explore the concept of the ‘public realm’ by appropriating and disrupting environmental designers’ two <b>dimensional</b> perspective <b>sketches.</b> These stylized sketches, typically used for marketing purposes within the design profession, are distorted and warped into unsettling places. Idyllic visions of parks, waterfront plazas, playgrounds, and other nostalgic public places are transformed into doomsday scenarios through the injection of fragmented media images and individual memory of catastrophic events. By making the familiar feel unfamiliar, I hope to generate a series of enigmatic and uneasy associations for the viewer. The designer's intention to convert virgin space into a democratic, civic place becomes compromised and circumspect during these moments of danger. These places deny the viewer the comfort of representing any specific location, and yet seem uncannily familiar. Built form transgresses from a designer's optimistic sketch for the future into glimpses of destruction and uncertainty. The structure of the thesis begins with an introduction to the main themes of my research. Firstly, I explore a variety of approaches to the visualization of idealized public places. By discussion of the forms and intentions of Deconstructivist architecture and the notion of the architectural uncanny, I provide a theoretical backdrop toward the investigation of contemporary approaches to placemaking. I describe my background in environmental design and the impact of my Modernist training on my painting practice. Secondly, I describe how the preceding ideas are addressed in my painting practice. By situating my work with regard to contemporary painters such as Peter Doig, Daniel Richter, Neo Rauch, and Matthias Weischer, I investigate common themes or points of departure with respect to the representation of place and space, mark making, colour and composition in their work. Lastly, I focus on six paintings from my thesis project work. I describe the creative process for generating images, discuss source material, painting techniques, the use of the figure, specific influences and the intentions of each piece.

40|$|While {{there has}} been a lot of work on {{freehand}} drawing programs, robust programs which are easy to learn are still not available. We feel our program DrawCAD takes signif-icant steps in this direction. Two <b>dimensional</b> drawings are <b>sketched</b> by the user using the mouse; DrawCAD analyzes the sketches and infers the intent of the user and produces beautified drawings. DrawCAD also infers and maintains constraints between various elements of the drawing. Sup-ported constraints include horizontality or verticality of lines, tangency between arcs and lines, parallelism/perpendicularity between lines, equality of angles or line segment lengths. Some of these constraints are inferred as the user draws, and some can be explicitly added using well known conventions of Euclidean Geometry (e. g. putting a wedge to indicate per-pendicularity). The key idea in this is to treat the strokes drawn by the user on one hand as actual drawing elements, but at the same time as gestures. We feel that this makes it easy for the user to declare his/her intent, and also easy for DrawCAD to recognize the intent. User studies are presented in which some benchmark draw-ings are created using DrawCAD as well as standard pro-grams. Some of our benchmarks are simple informal draw-ings, and others are detailed engineering drawings with di-mensions etc. Our general conclusion is that DrawCAD is very robust, easy to learn, and fast to use.

40|$|What is {{sketching}} for {{a landscape}} architect? Does it involve anything else than the sketching process, the tool {{with which we}} work and carry a project through? The answer is yes, {{it is a process}} but one that includes many functions like making notes in drawings or words for remembrance, a way to convey your ideas to others and to clearify ideas for yourself or together in a group. This thesis aim to give a broader picture of what sketches and sketching is through many voices, and images made by architects, a psychiatrist, a teacher, and landscape architect students. The focus is on the hand made sketch and show many examples of what a sketch can look like. What is a sketch? A sketch can be many things, but the general consensus is that it is made fast and as a draft. It can be made in any material, two or three <b>dimensional.</b> The <b>sketching</b> technique you use while sketching does not defi ne whether it is a sketch or not but only which technique you used. The function of a sketch changes and it will look differently depending on the reason why it was made. Why is it important for a landscape architect to sketch? If the tool is the sketches that I make {{in order to make the}} sketching process run smoothly, how do I go about to improve my sketching process? Well, four older well known architects tell stories about how important it is to sketch, all the time, in order to start saving images in your head that you can access at any time, in any sketching project. Then the reason for sketching becomes unimportant, only the fact that we do it, will make a difference. One way to help us sketch more is to think about how we can improve our ways of registering the outside world. For instance the use of the digital camera. By making a conscious choice to use the sketch book rather than taking pictures, you learn to interpret what you see into a sketch. As the landscape architect school around the world differ, they can be scientifi c or artistically dominated. Does this mean anything in the way we communicate amongst each other? 19 students from Sweden, Slovakia, Estonia, England, Czech Republic, Canada, Germany, Austria and China answered questions on how they defi ne, use, learned to sketch, fi nd joy in and are inspired by sketches within the landscape architect profession. The sketching process is a method of working that can be learned by any person. The landscape architect have taken this method and learned to excel in it. But this process takes many years to master. That is a reason why constant refl ection on the process of sketching is so important...|$|R
40|$|This study {{set out to}} {{investigate}} the learning and change that emerged in and through participatory mapping {{in the context of}} biocultural diversity and resilience in rural Ethiopia. It did this through examining the learning and agency emerging from three participatory mapping practices (Participatory 3 <b>Dimensional</b> Modelling, <b>sketch</b> mapping and eco-cultural calendars) using two case study sites, located in the Bale Mountains and the Foata Mountains in Ethiopia, and honing in on in-depth reflective processes in two community contexts located within the broader case study sites, namely Horo Soba, Dinsho wereda in Bale; and Telecho, in Wolmera wereda, in the Foata Mountain complex. This study tried to answer three research questions related to participatory mapping: its role in mobilizing knowledge related to biocultural landscape, its role in learning and change, and its value in building resilience. The study used qualitative case study research methodology underpinned by critical realist philosophy, and used photographic ‘cues’ to structure the reporting on the cases. It used four categories of analysis: biocultural diversity, educational processes, learning and agency, in the first instance to report on the interactions associated with the participatory mapping practices as they emerged in the two case study sites. This was followed by in-depth analysis and interpretation of participatory mapping and biocultural diversity, as well as participatory mapping and learning, with an emphasis on acquisition, meaning making and identity formation processes. The in-depth analysis drew on social and learning theory, and theory of biocultural diversity and social-ecological resilience. The study also included analysis of broader change processes that were related to and emerged from the social interactions in the mapping activities, and the resultant morphogenesis (change), showing that morphogenesis, while broadly temporal, is not linear, and involves ‘little iterative morphogenic cycles’. These insights were then used to interpret how participatory mapping may contribute to resilience building in a context where social-ecological resilience is increasingly required, such as the two case study sites, where socialecological degradation is highly visible and is occurring rapidly. The study’s contribution to new knowledge lies in relation to the role of participatory mapping in facilitating learning, agency and change which, to date, appears to be under-theorised and under-developed in the participatory mapping and environmental education literature. As such, the study findings provide in-depth insight into how participatory mapping methodologies may ‘work in the world’, in contexts such as those presented in the two cases under study. It has tried to demonstrate how participatory mapping has managed to mobilize knowledge related to biocultural diversity, facilitated the acquisition of knowledge and helped members of the community to engage in meaning making activities relevant to their biocultural landscape and renegotiate their identity within the wider community context. It has also shown that dissonance is an important dynamic in the learning process; and that morphogenesis (or change) occurs over time, but also in smaller cycles that interact at different levels; and that participatory mapping cannot, by itself mobilise significant structural change, {{at least in the short}} term. It has also shown, however, that learning and the desire for change can emerge from participatory mapping processes, and that this can be utilized to adapt to the changing socio-ecological environments, potentially contributing to longer term resilience of social-ecological systems. ...|$|R
