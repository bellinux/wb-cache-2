5000|$|HFI {{successfully}} appealed {{under section}} 67 of the Customs Act from three {{decisions of the}} Deputy Minister of National Revenue made under subsection 63(3) of the Customs Act on Monday, July 17, 1995. [...] This successful appeal changed the way duties were charged on wood flooring products, thereby reducing the cost of wood flooring, making it more affordable for the consumer. This was {{an important factor in}} wood <b>flooring's</b> significant increase in popularity and market share with the North American consumer over the last generation.|$|R
50|$|The United Kingdom {{has since}} 1971 had {{well-established}} slip resistance standards {{based on the}} pendulum. This test was developed for pedestrian traction by the U.S. National Bureau of Standards in the 1940s and further refined in the UK. It was validated for pedestrian traction in 1971, together with its safety standards, in the UK {{over a period of}} 25 years by 3500 real-world public walking area tests and site accident records. The test is an ASTM standard (E 303), slightly modified for pedestrian traction. The usual safety standard for a level floor is a minimum Pendulum Test Value (PTV) of 36. The pendulum is also the instrument used in the Sustainable Slip Resistance test method, which measures the possible impact of years of use on a potential <b>flooring's</b> slip resistance. The pendulum is also used in the U.S. and elsewhere for determining the slipperiness of roads and airport runways.|$|R
40|$|HOUSING for pigs reared {{for meat}} has been revolutionised {{over the past}} 50 years, and {{modifications}} in flooring have been {{a key component of}} this change. While the introduction of slatted floors that do not require manual removal of soiled bedding and dung has reduced labour requirements and production costs, solid floors are still in use on some commercial farms in Britain, particularly in older or converted buildings, and are more common in Britain than in other European pig-producing countries. Floors in pig housing can impact on the health and welfare of pigs by affecting an animal’s opportunity to engage in normal behaviour and increasing the risk of infectious disease and physical damage due to contact with the floor. This article highlights the impact of floor types on the prevalence of foot, limb and body lesions, and lameness in pigs, and provides typical examples of the pathology of some lesions. Indoor pigs are in constant contact with the floor of their pen, which can {{have a major impact on}} their welfare <b>FLOORING</b> IN PIG HOUSING O...|$|R

50|$|Some sub-floors are inset {{below the}} top surface level of {{surrounding}} <b>flooring's</b> joists and such subfloors and a normal height joist are joined {{to make a}} plywood box both molding and containing at least 2 in of concrete (A 'Mud Floor' in builders parlance). Alternatively, only a slightly inset floor topped by a fibrous mesh and concrete building composite floor cladding is used for smaller high quality tile floors - these 'concrete' subfloors have a good thermal match with ceramic tiles and so are popular with builders constructing kitchen, laundry and especially both common and high end bathrooms and any other room where large expanses of well supported ceramic tile will be used as a finished floor. Floors using small (4.5 in and smaller) ceramic tiles generally use only an additional 1/4 in layer of plywood (if that) and substitute adhesive and substrate materials making do with both a flexible joints and semi-flexible mounting compounds and so are designed to withstand the greater flexing which large tiles cannot tolerate without breaking.|$|R
40|$|Due to its {{extraordinary}} hardness, decorative {{appearance and}} possible small di-mensions, black locust wood {{is assumed to}} be an excellent material for strip parquet flooring. The favourable colour changes achieved by controlled steam treatment further increased the utilization potential of this material. Flooring was installed on a student dormitory stair landing in heavy use. Due to the <b>flooring’s</b> very high exposure, 5 years was considered a long enough period to compare the different face layer materials during in-service test. Oil was used as a coating to avoid the remarkable protecting effect of hard film-forming varnishes (acrylic, etc.) against abrasion. Besides the flooring turning grey (all face layers no matter what treat-ment), only some delamination occurred at certain places after five years in service. The laboratory test results for abrasion resistance, dimensional changes and de-formation were analysed. Additionally, the Brinell-Mörath hardness after indoor service and the abrasion due to indoor service were analysed. In terms of abrasion resistance, dimensional changes and deformation, no essential {{differences were found between the}} oil-treated and untreated black locust wood on the one hand, and the control oak specimen on the other. Long-term tests showed that, after 5 years in service, the Brinell-Mörath-hardness decreased considerably for all the tested materials. The type of section and the presence of wide rays influenced the rough-ness and the waviness of the surface after indoor service...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{environmental}} impacts {{come from the}} construction and operation of buildings. As of 2006, the US Geological Survey {{found that more than}} 75 % of the raw materials (by weight) consumed in the United States were used for construction. Additionally, home and commercial buildings consume 70 % of electricity and emit 40 % of the greenhouse gases in the US, according to the US Department of Energy. Improvements to buildings through more efficient materials could dramatically change the world's energy consumption. The goal of this research is to conduct a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and a Life Cycle Costing (LCC) analysis on various components in homes to determine which materials selections are best in terms of the environment, cost, and overall sustainability performance for the lifetime of a home. All phases of the life of a product are considered; including resources, manufacturing, installation, end-of-life, and most notably, use. Housing components chosen for the study can be retrofitted in an existing home and can make {{a significant impact on the}} energy or material use of a home. The housing components studied include flooring, windows, roofing systems, and wall insulation. Energy use was modeled for the windows, roofing systems, and wall insulation studies for a standard single-family home in 17 different US cities, representing all of the climate zones in the US. The energy consumption information was used to determine how using different materials as well as efficiency increases for a material, such as increasing R-value, could affect the {{environmental impacts}} and economic impacts over the lifetime of a product and a home. Retrofitting windows, roofing systems, and wall insulation can greatly impact the energy demand of a home for heating, ventilation, and cooling, leading to lower environmental and economic impacts. While flooring does not directly impact the home's energy demand for heating and cooling, <b>flooring's</b> environmental impacts over a lifetime can be attributed primarily to flooring maintenance, particularly when the maintenance involves vacuuming. This study asserts the crucial link between the use phase of housing components on the environmental, economic, and sustainability performance of a home. It establishes a sustainability metric which can be utilized by developers, homeowners, or manufacturers to understand the performance of a product employed in a home over the time frame the home is in operation. The developed framework can be employed to look at any components within a home. Additionally, the study investigates the importance of location and climate zone on these results. Ph. D...|$|R

60|$|Mr. Oliver assented, and an {{hour later}} they paddled off to the sloop.

When they came to the jib Mr. Oliver stood up on the deck looking about him.|$|E
60|$|Whitney dished the ham {{and made}} some coffee, cut a loaf that was not very wet, {{and took out a}} sticky jar of marmalade. Leaning forward from the lockers, they began to eat; but care was needed in taking things from the table, which swiveled above the centerboard-trunk, for a rash {{movement}} would precipitate all it held upon the sloppy <b>floorings.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "We've about stores {{enough to}} last two weeks--that is, if you don't expect too much," [...] Lewson pointed out. [...] "There's an American stove in the deck-house, {{and while we}} can't find {{anything}} meant to burn in it there's an ax down forward, and we could cut out cabin <b>floorings,</b> or a beam or two, without taking too much stiffening out of her." ...|$|E
60|$|Tilting {{the case}} in savage anger, Jimmy shook {{out a number of}} small gray lumps. They {{scattered}} about the <b>floorings,</b> and when he gashed one with his knife the metal cut soft and showed a silvery luster. He dropped the knife and his face grew hard and white. There was tense silence for a moment, and then Jimmy, rousing himself with an effort, flung the scuttle back.|$|E
60|$|They ate hungrily {{while the}} water splashed beneath the <b>floorings</b> and the lamp swung at erratic angles as the Cetacea rolled; and Bethune made no {{objection}} when Jimmy afterward lighted his pipe. The case lay against the centerboard trunk, {{but they did}} not feel impatient to open it. This was a pleasure that would lose nothing by being deferred; they were satisfied to sit still in the warm cabin and gloat over their success.|$|E
60|$|So it {{came about}} at length they could keep only one fire, in the kitchen, and that but small, which {{in the end they}} were obliged to feed with the doors of the outhouses, and even with the <b>floorings</b> torn out of the attics, in order that they might cook their food. Nor was there much of this; only a store of salt meat and some pickled pork and smoked bacon, {{together}} {{with a certain amount of}} oatmeal and flour, that they made into cakes and bread.|$|E
60|$|Appleby {{lay down}} on the wet <b>floorings</b> with an old sail over him, and for a time felt the swift swing of the little craft, and heard the gurgling swirl of brine, for the breeze she sped before was now {{breaking}} the heave into splashing seas. Then he became oblivious to everything save when a little shower of spray blew into his face. At last he fancied that Harper was trying to stir him with his foot, and blinked at him vacantly, until Harper kicked him harder.|$|E
60|$|The night {{got very}} dark, for the land-breeze brought off a haze, but the engine lamp and {{glow from the}} furnace door threw an elusive glimmer about the craft. White sea-crests chased and caught her up, and rolling forward broke between the funnel and the bows. Water splashed on board, the engine hissed as the spray fell on it, and the <b>floorings</b> got wet. One could see the foam on deck wash about the headledge forward as the bows went up with a {{sluggishness}} that was the consequence of carrying an extra load of coal.|$|E
60|$|He dropped unceremoniously {{into the}} saloon, where Miss Austerly {{lay on the}} settee, and tore up the <b>floorings,</b> beneath which, as space is {{valuable}} on board a craft of the Sorata's size, the smaller anchor is sometimes kept. He could not, however, find it anywhere, and when he swung himself, hot and breathless, out on deck, the yacht was driving seaward stern foremost, taking her anchor with her, while the whole Inlet was ridged with lines of white. Anthea Merril {{looked at him with}} suppressed apprehension in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|One {{hand was}} all I needed. There was now nothing any unassisted man could do except keep the craft {{straight}} before wind and sea, {{but it was}} quite sufficient for one who had lost much of his dexterity with the tiller, and at times the boat twisted on a white crest in imminent peril of rolling over. Worse than all, the waves that smote the flat stern commenced to splash on board, and the water inside the boat rose rapidly. Already the <b>floorings</b> were floating, and I dare not for a second loose the tiller. It was Lucille Haldane who solved the difficulty.|$|E
60|$|Giving Jake the helm, Dick crawled {{under the}} foredeck, where the <b>floorings</b> were drier than {{anywhere}} else, and lay smoking and thinking until day broke. The light, which grew brighter rapidly, showed a glistening line of surf to seaward and mangrove forest {{on a point}} ahead. Beyond this {{there seemed to be}} an inlet, and then the shore curved out again. As they passed the point Dick stood up on deck and presently saw two tall spars rise above the mist. A few minutes later, the top of a funnel appeared, and then a sharp metallic rattle rang through the haze.|$|E
60|$|Clay bumped {{his head}} before {{he found a}} place on a locker, where he sat silent for a moment, looking about. The light of the {{bulkhead}} lamp revealed the rough discomfort of the narrow cabin. Condensed moisture glistened on the low roof-beams; the <b>floorings</b> were damp and littered with coils of rope. The end of a torn sail projected from the forecastle door, and damp blankets were loosely spread on the lockers to dry {{in the warmth of}} the rusty stove. All this indicated stern, utilitarian economy, and the men’s ragged, work-stained clothes were in keeping with it; but Clay noticed that their expression was resolute.|$|E
60|$|Walthew {{scrambled}} to his feet, and stood swaying awkwardly with the violent motion, {{in danger of}} going overboard. The sea had got worse, and the savage wind lashed his wet face. It was blowing very hard, and {{the turn of the}} tide had brought broken water nearer inshore; he could hear the roar of the surf upon the beach. It would now be dangerous to land; but he must try to rescue his comrade. He seized the oar the man nearest to him pulled. The fellow pushed him back and, losing his balance as the boat plunged over a comber, he fell heavily upon the <b>floorings.</b>|$|E
60|$|Jake put {{a kettle}} on the cylinder-top and took some {{provisions}} from a locker. He was hungry {{and thought he}} might need all the strength he had, while {{he did not want}} to look at the sea. The pump was clanking hard, but he could hear the water wash about under the <b>floorings,</b> and the launch was very wet. Darkness fell as he prepared a meal with the fireman's help, and they ate by the dim light of the engine-lamp, while Dick, to whom they handed portions, crouched at the helm, gazing close into the illuminated compass. Sometimes he missed the food they held out and it dropped and was washed into the pump-well, but he ate what he could without moving his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Presently he {{went out}} to look at the weather. The rain had stopped and low mist hung about, but a {{half-moon}} was rising in a patch of clear sky. The swell heaved, long and smooth, about the sloop, which swung up and down with a regular motion. Jimmy could see the yacht’s anchor light not far away and the yellow blink from her saloon windows, but he could hear nothing that suggested preparations for sending off a boat. As it was cold in the cockpit, he returned to the cabin, where the others had lighted the lamp, and none of them said much for the next hour. They could hear the loose halyards slap the mast and the water splash about beneath the <b>floorings,</b> and the soft lapping of the tide along the planking.|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the slant of sail and deck increased. One {{side of the}} sloop was hove high out of the sea. It was all the girl could do to hold herself upright, and Mrs. Nairn had fallen against and was only supported by the coaming to leeward. Then the wind was suddenly cut off and the sloop rose with a bewildering lurch, as the tall iron hull to weather forged by, hurling off the sea. She passed, and while Vane called out something and Carroll scrambled forward, the sloop swayed violently down again. Everything in her creaked; the <b>floorings</b> sloped away beneath Evelyn's feet, and now the madly-whirling froth poured in across the coaming. The veins stood out on the helmsman's forehead, his pose betrayed the tension on his arms; but the sloop was swinging round, and she fell off before the wind when {{the upper half of}} the great sail collapsed.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{staggered}} aft a pace or two, {{and sitting}} down breathless and dripping gazed about him. The boat looked {{a good deal}} bigger than she had appeared from the steamer, and, {{as a matter of}} fact, she was a half-decked sloop of about twenty-four feet in length. Just then she was slanted well down on one side, with the water foaming along her depressed deck and showers of spray beating into her over her weather bow, while the jib above her bowsprit every now and then plunged into the short, white-topped seas. There seemed to be some water inside her, for it washed up above the <b>floorings</b> at every heave. In a few moments Frank had recovered his breath sufficiently to look around at his companions. One was a boy of about his own age who smiled at him. He had a bronzed skin and a kindly expression, and looked lean and wiry.|$|E
6000|$|The reader {{may have}} {{discovered}} {{by this time}} that the Captain was no ordinary man. Whatever he did in connection with himself was done with almost superhuman energy and noise. Since the commencement of his residence in the garret he had unwittingly subjected the nerves of poor Mrs Roby to such a variety of shocks, that the mere fact of her reason remaining on its throne was an unquestionable proof of a more than usually powerful constitution. It could not well be otherwise. The Captain's limbs resembled the limbs of oaks in regard to size and toughness. His spirits were far above [...] "proof." [...] His organs were cathedral organs compared with the mere barrel-organs of ordinary men. On the other hand, the [...] "cabin" [...] in Grubb's Court was but a flimsy tenement; its plank <b>floorings</b> were thin, and its beams and rafters slim and somewhat loose owing to age, {{so that when the}} captain snored, which he did regularly and continuously, {{it was as if a}} mastiff had got inside a double-bass and were growling hideously.|$|E
6000|$|On the {{crumbling}} {{black and white}} marble <b>floorings</b> the water indeed was trickling into pools. And down in the halls there came to us wandering--strangest thing that ever strayed through deserted grandeur--a brown, broken horse, lean, with a sore flank and a head of tremendous age. It stopped and gazed at us, as though we might be {{going to give it}} things to eat, then passed on, stumbling over the ruined marbles. For a moment we had thought him ghost--one of the many. But he was not, since his hoofs sounded. The scrambling clatter of them had died out into silence before we came to that dark, crypt-like chamber whose marble columns were ringed in iron, veritable pillars of foundation. And then we saw that our old guide's hands were full of newspapers. She struck a match; they caught fire and blazed. Holding high that torch, she said: [...] "See! Up there's his name, above where he stood. The auctioneer. Oh yes, indeed! Here's where they sold them!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. It {{meant she}} was leaking hard, and I'll admit that rather {{staggered}} me, because she'd always been a remarkably tight craft. Well, I hove her to again, lighted the cabin lamp, and pulled up the <b>floorings.</b> This wasn't easy; they were closely fitted and the carpenter had nailed {{one or two of}} them down. I can't tell you why he did it, but I tore my hand before I got them loose. You can understand that I had to be quick. She wouldn't lie to well with nobody at the helm, and kept forging up head to wind and falling off again. The way she lurched about threw me against the lockers and once or twice I heard a sea come on board. There was too much water for me to find where it was coming in, and when I crawled out and tried the pump it wouldn't draw, so I went back and felt for the bottom of its pipe. There was a suction-box at the end, and it seemed to be stuffed up with shavings. The carpenter must have thrown them under the floor." ...|$|E
60|$|After some {{discussion}} Redmond reluctantly agreed to remain behind {{in charge of}} the gold Dane brought down; and it was nearly dark when, without shipping overmuch water, the surf-boat cleared the beach, and with tall lugsail straining, lurched away eastward over the moonlit swell. It was then that, lying in the stern to rest and gather strength for what might yet be required of him, Dane told Gilby his detailed story. He could afterward recall the intent face fixed upon him, the crash of breakers throbbing through the haze that hid the shore, and the listing craft's swift rise and fall. At the time, however, he was conscious of nothing except that they were speeding east, and that the trader assured him the slender native canoe dare carry very little sail in such a strength of breeze. Gilby held the tiller, a big Krooboy sat on the weather gunwale slacking off the lugsail sheet each time the boat dipped her side to a stronger puff of breeze, and Amadu lay on the weather <b>floorings,</b> deadly sick and groaning horribly, to the amusement of the amphibious heathen.|$|E
60|$|The {{heat was}} pitiless in the afternoon, but Walthew pulled his oar {{and carried the}} hundred-pound coal bags across a stretch of mire that grew broader as the tide ebbed. He could {{scarcely}} pull his feet out and keep the load upon his aching back, and he sometimes sank knee-deep in the softer spots. The air was heavy with exhalations from the swamps; he had thrown off his jacket and the coal wore holes in his shirt and rubbed raw places on his skin. He was wet from the waist downward and black above, while the gritty dust filled his eyes and nostrils. Still he held out until the work was finished, when the Enchantress's cargo-light began to twinkle through the dusk; and then, losing his balance, he fell forward into the boat with his last heavy load. Miguel pushed her off, and with oars splashing slackly she moved downstream. When she ran alongside the steamer, Grahame saw a limp, black figure lying huddled on the <b>floorings.</b> The others lifted it gently, but Walthew did not speak when he was laid on deck, and Macallister, bending over him, looked up at Grahame.|$|E
60|$|Whitney lighted {{his pipe}} {{while he waited}} to allow the birds to recover from their alarm, {{but he had to}} strike several matches because his hands were wet, and he was annoyed to find that he had not many left. It was very dark, and a cold wind was blowing. Whitney lay down on the <b>floorings,</b> for shelter and to hide the glow of his pipe. The birds were quiet, but a dull, {{throbbing}} roar came out of the distance, and he supposed it was the splash of the surf on the seaward edge of the shoals. When his pipe was empty, he got up, intending to step overboard and drag the dinghy down to the receding water; but he found that this was not needful, as the ebb had nearly run out. Paddling up the channel he heard the whistle of curlew, and for a time followed the invisible birds. He could not get a shot, and, deciding that he had had enough, he laid down the paddles. Hitherto, he had been looking ahead, but when he put the oars in the crutches he was facing aft.|$|E
