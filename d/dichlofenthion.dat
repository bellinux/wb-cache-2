50|$|<b>Dichlofenthion</b> (IUPAC name: O-2,4-Dichlorophenyl O,O-diethyl {{phosphorothioate}}) is a phosphorothioate {{which is}} primarily {{used as a}} pesticide and nematicide.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichlofenthion</b> has a {{relatively}} short half-life {{of only a few}} minutes in both water and soils. While little research has been conducted over the environmental fate this compound, much is known about the compound class in which it resides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dichlofenthion</b> is {{generally}} considered to be an organophosphate pesticide, although in a strict chemical sense, it is a phosphorothioate. Because most organophosphate pesticides biodegrade relatively quickly, they are generally regarded as safe for use. While this may be true for most compounds, bacteria still require time to adapt to break down new compounds introduced to the soil. It has been shown that degradation rates increase as the same compounds are introduced repeatedly into the soil.|$|E
50|$|To {{remove and}} manage the {{infestation}} of larvae in the host, the larvae may be removed with forceps. This removal process should take place daily or as often as needed until the infestation is clear. These larvae can also be killed by applying proper insecticides to the infected areas and making sure the wounds are properly dressed. Organophosphorus insecticides like coumaphos, <b>dichlofenthion,</b> and fenchlorphos {{can be applied to}} wounds with fly larvae. These cause the larvae to leave the wound and fall to the ground, and the larvae will die without a host to feed on. Castration wounds in cattle that have insect growth regulators, such as dicyclanil, have high success rates of preventing the establishment of C. bezziana.|$|E
40|$|A treated surface {{bioassay}} {{was used}} to detect insecticide resistance to five organophosphorus insecticides (diazinon, chlorfevinphos, chlorpyrifos, <b>dichlofenthion</b> and propetamphos), the synthetic pyrethroid, deltamethrin, and the insect growth regulator, diflubenzuron, in larvae of field strains of Lucilia cuprina, and diazinon in Lucilia sericata from 1990 to 1997. Organophosphate resistance was widespread in both species of blowfly and L. cuprina exhibited side-resistance between diazinon, chlorpyrifos, <b>dichlofenthion</b> and propetamphos but no cross-resistance could be demonstrated with diazinon and deltamethrin, or between diazinon and diflubenzuron. Phenotypic expression of resistance appeared {{to be influenced by}} environmental factors such as season, region, sheep density and year. The relative efficacies of four of the above OPs {{and the extent to which}} the OP resistance status of L. cuprina affected this, was assessed by comparing a susceptible strain of L. cuprina, and a strain known to exhibit OP side-resistance, in a series of in vivo trials. All four treatments provided 19 - 21 weeks protection against susceptible larvae but chlorfenvinphos provided the longest protection (16 - 17 weeks), followed by propetamphos (15 - 16 weeks), <b>dichlofenthion</b> (10 - 13 weeks) and diazinon (9 - 13 weeks), against the resistant strain. Penetration of insect cuticle, non-oxidative and oxidative mechanisms that might contribute to resistance to organophosphate insecticides were examined in larvae and adults from field isolates of L. cuprina. Only non-oxidative mechanisms were considered with respect to L. sericata. The basal mechanism of resistance appeared to be an altered esterase (the E 3 esterase) in L. cuprina and was also suspected to contribute to OP-resistance in L. sericata. Adult and larval strains of L. sericata showed no relationship between level of GST conjugating activity and resistance to diazinon, suggesting that these enzymes do not constitute a mechanism of OP-resistance in this species. Contrasting this was the observation of a strong relationship between the level of GST conjugating activity, with respect to model substrate DCNB, and resistance to diazinon in both adult and larval strains of L. cuprina. This relationship was supported by a study of the OP-conjugating properties of partially purified glutathione S-transferases from resistant L. cuprina larvae. Neither an increase in acetylcholinesterase content nor an insensitive AChE in the central nervous system of larvae of L. cuprina and larvae or adult L. sericata appear to have been selected for in the resistant field strains examined. There did however appear to be a positive correlation between resistance to diazinon and susceptibility of AChE inactivation by tetrachlorvinphos in L. cuprina adults. The significance of this factor was investigated further by multiple regression and it was concluded that this did not have a main effect on resistance in adults. Samples of L. cuprina were further characterised by RAPD-PCR to determine intra-and inter-strain variation. Key features of this analysis were the calculation of phylogenetic similarities in an attempt to better define a 'field strain', the mode of dispersal of the species throughout New Zealand as well as to identify genetic markers of high level insecticide resistance. No markers of resistance were identified but this study emphasised the need to treat each sample as a separate strain as sampling from the same area at different times showed that samples were not identical suggesting there is variable gene flow in and out of areas and populations. Based on biochemical identification of resistance mechanisms, consideration was given to the use of potentiating pairs of insecticides as a method of prolonging the life of some existing OP insecticides. It was shown that prospects for using such pairs is limited due to the widespread OP-resistance observed in L. cuprina. Finally, rather than reiterate discussion of resistance mechanisms, the conclusion of this thesis looks towards applying knowledge of resistance mechanisms effectively within the framework of integrated pest management system (IPM). It discusses areas of weakness in knowledge that need to be addressed and emphasises the need for a susceptibility reservoir if IPM is to succeed at a national level...|$|E
30|$|TiO 2 {{was used}} as an {{efficient}} and selective sorbent to recognize the phosphorylation moiety based on a strong chelation with phospho-moieties. The affinity of TiO 2 towards the phosphoric group is favorable for fast enrichment and detection of free organophosphate pesticides [19]. However, the wide band gap of TiO 2 (∼ 3.2 eV, anatase) allows it to absorb only the ultraviolet light (< 387 nm). To extend its photo response to the visible region and to promote the photoelectric conversion efficiency, many modification methods have been applied (e.g., dye sensitization, metal ion/nonmetal atom doping, semiconductor coupling, and noble metal deposition) [19, 66]. Of the abovementioned methods, by considering the high electron mobility of nanocrystals and the possibility of shifting the optical band gap to the visible light region using organic materials, the organic–inorganic heterojunction can produce a robust photoelectrochemical sensor. Zhou reported that graphene-modified TiO 2 nanotube arrays exhibit an excellent enrichment efficiency for carbamate pesticides including metolcarb, carbaryl, isoprocarb, and diethofencarb. The detection limits of these carbamate pesticides range from 2.27 to 3.26  μg L− 1. The method {{could be used as a}} faster and easier alternative procedure for routine analysis of carbamate pesticides [67]. Li et al. developed two photoelectrochemical sensors to detect <b>dichlofenthion</b> and chlorpyrifos pesticides. The sensors were based on a TiO 2 photocatalyst coupled with electrochemical detection, which is a derivative of an electrochemical sensor and sensitized TiO 2 [68, 69].|$|E
40|$|The use of {{chemicals}} is continuously growing both in total amount {{as well as in}} a number of different substances, among which organic chemicals play a major role. Owing to the growing public awareness on the need of protecting both ecosystems and human health from the risks related to chemical pollution, an increasing attention has been drowned to risk assessment and prioritization of organic pollutants. In this context, the aims of this study were (a) to perform an environmental risk assessment for 200 organic micropollutants including both regulated and emerging contaminants (pesticides, alkylphenols, pharmaceuticals, hormones, personal care products, perflourinated compounds and various industrial organic chemicals) monitored in four rivers located in the Mediterranean side of the Iberian Peninsula, namely, the Ebro, Llobregat, Júcar and Guadalquivir rivers; and (b) to prioritize them for each of the four river basins studied, taking into account their observed concentration levels together with their ecotoxicological potential. For this purpose, a prioritization approach has been developed and a resulting ranking index (RI) associated with each compound. Ranking index is based on the measured concentrations of the chemical in each river and its ecotoxicological potential (EC 50 values for algae, Daphnia sp. and fish). Ten compounds were identified as most important for the studied rivers: pesticides chlorpyriphos, chlorfenvinphos, diazinon, <b>dichlofenthion,</b> prochloraz, ethion carbofuran and diuron and the industrial organic chemicals nonylphenol and octylphenol that result from the biodegration of polyethoxylated alkyphenol surfactants.

40|$|Electrochemical methods {{coupled with}} {{biological}} elements {{are used in}} industrial, medical and environmental applications. In this thesis we will discuss two such applications: an electrochemical biosensor for detection of pesticides and biofuel generation using electrochemical methods coupled with microorganisms. Electrochemical biosensors are commonly used {{as a result of}} their selectivity, sensitivity, rapid response and portability. A common application for electrochemical biosensors is detection of pesticides and toxins in water samples. In this thesis, we will focus on detection of organosphosphates (OPs), a group of compounds that are commonly used as pesticides and nerve agents. Rapid and sensitive detection of these compounds has been an area of active research due to their high toxicity. Amperometric and potentiometric electrochemical biosensors that use organophosphorus hydrolase (OPH), an enzyme that can hydrolyze a broad class of OPs, have been reported for field detection of OPs. Amperometry is used for detection of electroactive leaving groups and potentiometry is used for detection of pH changes that take place during the hydrolysis reaction. Both these methods have limitations: using amperometric biosensors, very low limits of detection are achieved but this method is limited to the few OPs with electroactive leaving groups, on the other hand potentiometric biosensor can be used for detection of all OPs but they don't have low enough limits of detection. We have developed a novel dual enzyme biosensor biosensor with OPH and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for detection of OPs with phenolic leaving groups which are much more common than electroactive leaving groups. This biosensor was used for detection of <b>dichlofenthion,</b> an OP which does not have an electroactive leaving group. Electrochemical biosensors with enzymatic layers such as the one described above are commonly used, however there are no clear guidelines on how to design these sensors. Based on the application, the biosensor might be designed for a target limit of detection, sensitivity and/or linear range. Simulation tools can be used to provide general guidelines that can be applied to a wide range of biosensors and reduce extensive development time. In chapter 3, reaction-diffusion equations for an enzymatic biosensor with saturation kinetics are solved. Dimensionless numbers that can guide the researchers on designing and optimizing biosensors are presented. Additionally results from a formaldehyde biosensor are presented to demonstrate the use of some of the guidelines introduced. Recently biofuel production using electricity has become an attractive area of research in the interface between electrochemistry and biology. Biofuel production from renewable resources is the challenge of our century. Bioproduction using natural photosynthesis routes suffers from low efficiencies. An alternative to photosynthesis is the use of chemolithoautotrophic organisms that are genetically engineered to produce biofuels. These organisms use inorganic redox mediators as their energy source instead of photosynthesis. A sustainable biofuel production process is feasible, if the chemolithoautotrophic organisms are coupled with an electrochemical reactor to recycle the redox mediator. We will describe the development of an electrochemical reactor that reduces nitrite to ammonia which is the natural mediator couple for the chemolithoautotrophic organism Nitrosomonas europaea. Using nickel and glassy carbon electrodes nearly 100 % current efficiencies were obtained in batch electrolysis experiments in media optimal for N. europaea growth. Additionally effect of production of the potential biofuel isobutanol on cathode performance was studied. A flow-by electrochemical reactor with a porous electrode was designed to supply sufficient ammonia to a 5 L chemostat containing wild type N. europaea. Biomass production using electrochemically regenerated mediator was demonstrated by coupling this electrochemical reactor with N. europaea chemostat. Ammonia removal and biomass yield for the bacteria were unaffected by the coupled operation which suggests the electrochemically reduced media did not alter aerobic metabolism of the bacteria. Reduction of nitrite to ammonia was further investigated using linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. A limiting current plateau was identified in linear sweep experiments. In the pH range between 6. 0 and 8. 0, the flux of protons to the electrode were determined to cause mass transfer limitations. The same electrochemical methods were also used to assess the changes in performance of cathodes with time. Formation of a film was observed on glassy carbon and nickel electrodes. The film did not seem to cause any changes to the nickel electrode. On the other hand overpotential for the glassy carbon electrode was significantly reduced which would decrease power requirements for the electrochemical reactor and the overall process...|$|E
