5000|$|T43E2 - Two {{vehicles}} {{produced from}} 1955-56. Turret basket and gunner moved to front of turret. New targeting system (T52 rangefinder, T33 computer, T44 gunners periscopic sight) and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turret</b> traverse replaced with electric ...|$|R
50|$|M41A2: Incorporated a new <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turret</b> {{traverse}} system system, {{with direct}} mechanically linked {{control of the}} oil gear pump. Also featured a new AOS-895-5 fuel injection engine, dual power traverse for the tank commander, and a pinion-type gun elevation gear.|$|R
50|$|HMS Thunderer {{represented}} {{the culmination of}} this pioneering work. An ironclad turret ship designed by Edward James Reed, it was equipped with revolving turrets that used pioneering <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turret</b> machinery to maneouvre the guns. It was also the worlds first mastless battleship, built with a central superstructure layout, and became the prototype for all subsequent warships. HMS Devastation of 1871 was another pivotal design, and led directly to the modern battleship.|$|R
50|$|HMS Thunderer (1872) {{represented}} {{the culmination of}} this pioneering work.

It was also the world's first mastless battleship, built with a central superstructure layout, and became the prototype for all subsequent warships.

5000|$|Nash & Thompson {{developed}} the <b>hydraulic</b> gun <b>turrets</b> that Frazer-Nash invented and his designs were consequently numbered {{in a series}} prefixed with [...] "FN".|$|R
5000|$|... 1893-4 Streatham Pumping House. In {{the style}} of the day, built with domed and <b>turreted</b> neo-Byzantine <b>pumping</b> house and tall brick chimney stack {{in the form of a}} campanile.|$|R
50|$|The turret is also {{fitted with}} an {{internally}} controlled <b>hydraulic</b> charger, <b>turret</b> ventilating blower, emergency firing triggers and a rate controller for the 20 mm weapon which allows firing of 1, 2, 4 rds/s or full automatic mode.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of servo direct drive turret punch press is presented. A {{servomotor}} to drive the eccentric-toggle mechanism is used in our design, which combines the advantages of mechanical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turret</b> punch press. The displacement, velocity, and acceleration of the punch are calculated, through the kinematics analysis. So, {{the motion of the}} punch is controllable through the rotation of the servomotor. Then, the inverse kinematics analysis is studied in detail, and the corresponding motion of the servomotor can be gotten, for different punch motion curves, according to the production requirement. For example, when we design a motion of the punch for a particular stamping process, the motion of servomotor can be obtained through the inverse kinematics analysis. Finally, Output force is acquired by static force analysis, which decides the working capability of the mechanism...|$|R
50|$|In the {{standard}} interception, the fighter approached the target {{from the rear}} {{to get into a}} firing position, presenting the night fighter crew with a much smaller target, a problem compounded by the Royal Air Force bombers (such as the Whitley and Wellington medium bombers) first being fitted with twin-gun <b>hydraulic</b> tail <b>turrets,</b> later uprated to four guns to fend off just such attacks.|$|R
50|$|In 1929 Ron {{joined a}} new {{partnership}} with Archie Nash in Kingston-upon-Thames, Nash & Thomson. It {{was described as}} contractors and armament engineers for the Admiralty and the Air Ministry. Archie designed the <b>hydraulic</b> gun <b>turret</b> {{that was to be}} widely used in World War II. In 1935 Archie Nash took this business into Parnall Aircraft and Ron Godfrey moved to a new enterprise.|$|R
500|$|Four muzzle-loading smoothbore [...] guns, {{based on}} the American Rodman design, were {{originally}} intended as Petr Velikys main armament, but the Russians were impressed by a demonstration of a new Krupp [...] rifled gun. They bought a few guns directly {{as well as a}} production license and an enlarged 12-inch, 20-caliber, gun was selected to replace the 20-inch guns. In order to keep the gun ports as small as possible the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>turret</b> machinery raised and lowered the guns' trunnions rather than their muzzles. They had a maximum elevation of +12.5° and a maximum depression of −2.5°. This gave the guns a range of about [...] at maximum elevation. The gun turrets were of the Coles type and weighed [...] each. Powered by steam engines they could make a complete 360° rotation in one minute, although they had a firing arc of only 310°. The guns recoiled into the turrets after firing, which meant that a great deal of powder smoke was released into the turret. To counter this problem, ventilation fans were mounted in the turret roofs. The ship's machinery filled almost the entire breastwork, which forced the main gun magazines away from the turrets towards the ends of the ship, and that complicated the ammunition resupply arrangements for those guns. While some shells were stored in the breastwork, most were not, and likely would have slowed the ship's sustained rate of fire in a lengthy engagement.|$|R
50|$|Each fort had 2-4 batteries, {{equipped}} with <b>hydraulic</b> rotating steel <b>turrets</b> (100-150 mm). In {{the summer of}} 1944, only 10% of the batteries were fully operational. Most of those were in Fort Driant (Feste Kronprinz) and Fort Jeanne d'Arc (Feste Kaiserin). By November, {{during the battle of}} Metz, the German troops had managed to get about 50% of the guns operational in most of the forts listed below. These batteries were lacking range tables, missing sights and other equipment to make the guns fully operational.|$|R
50|$|Boulton Paul {{was one of}} the {{two main}} innovators of gun turret designs for British aircraft, along with Nash & Thomson; they {{supplied}} large numbers of installations for British aircraft. Boulton Paul's designs were largely based on originals licensed from the French company SAMM (Societe d'Application des Machines Motrices), while Nash & Thomson concentrated on the FN designs originated by the firm's co-founder, Archibald Frazer-Nash.Boulton Paul's turrets were electro-hydraulic in operation; electric motors located in the <b>turret</b> drove <b>hydraulic</b> <b>pumps</b> that powered hydraulic motors and rams. This was more effective than electric motors alone, and did not require power developed by the aircraft's engines as did the hydraulic system utilized by the Nash & Thomson design. Production was transferred to Joseph Lucas Ltd.|$|R
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 {{in an attempt to}} cure the electrical problems with her turrets, but they were still unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her <b>turrets</b> to <b>hydraulic</b> power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled the fault of the submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her <b>turrets</b> <b>hydraulic</b> power and make her battle-worthy.|$|R
500|$|At 09:27 a shell hitting Bismarck {{penetrated}} the <b>hydraulic</b> machinery in <b>turret</b> 'Anton' and disabled it, causing the guns {{to run down}} to maximum depression. Her topsides were wrecked, and a large fire burned amidships. After firing steadily for over 30 minutes, without any problems, King George V , by 09:27, began having trouble with her main battery, and from that point onward every salvo missed at least one gun due to failures in the safety interlocks for antiflash protection and from ammunition feed jams. At [...] 10:21, with Bismarck silenced and obviously sinking, Admiral Tovey detailed the cruiser [...] to finish her off with torpedoes. King George V fired 339 14 in (354 mm) and over 700 5.25 in (133 mm) shells during the action. As both Rodney and [...] King George V were low on fuel they returned to port at , escorted by eleven destroyers to guard against German air or submarine attack. The next day, after the escort was reduced to three destroyers, four German aircraft did attack but scored no hits. Both King George V and Rodney returned to port safely, but the destroyer , sent ahead to refuel, was bombed and sunk.|$|R
