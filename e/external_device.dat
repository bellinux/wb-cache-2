25|$|In 1950, Canadian {{electrical}} engineer John Hopps {{designed and built}} the first external pacemaker based upon observations by cardio-thoracic surgeon's Wilfred Gordon Bigelow and John Callaghan at Toronto General Hospital, although the device was first tested at the University of Toronto's Banting Institute on a dog. A substantial <b>external</b> <b>device</b> using vacuum tube technology to provide transcutaneous pacing, it was somewhat crude and painful to the patient in use and, being powered from an AC wall socket, carried a potential hazard of electrocution of the patient and inducing ventricular fibrillation.|$|E
25|$|The {{functions}} of neural oscillations are wide-ranging and vary for {{different types of}} oscillatory activity. Examples are the generation of rhythmic activity such as a heartbeat and the neural binding of sensory features in perception, such as the shape and color of an object. Neural oscillations also {{play an important role}} in many neurological disorders, such as excessive synchronization during seizure activity in epilepsy or tremor in patients with Parkinson's disease. Oscillatory activity can also be used to control external devices in brain–computer interfaces, in which subjects can control an <b>external</b> <b>device</b> by changing the amplitude of particular brain rhythmics.|$|E

Power-ups are scattered throughout the game and can be obtained by destroying certain objects. The player is able to pick up certain objects and manipulate them {{in a manner similar to}} the effects of the Gravity Gun from Half-Life 2, though without the necessity of an <b>external</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{determined}} {{the validity of}} using <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> for urine specimen collection from 24 elderly incontinent men residing {{in a nursing home}} by collecting three sequential specimens, two with <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> and then one by catheterization. The positive predictive value of organisms isolated in quantitative counts of {{greater than or equal to}} 10 (5) CFU/ml in <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> for bladder bacteriuria was 86 % for either sterile or clean collecting devices and 93 % for the same organism in two consecutive specimens. The negative predictive value for organisms present in quantitative counts of less than 10 (5) CFU/ml was 90 % for both sterile and clean devices and 86 % when the organism was present in both specimens. Contamination in <b>external</b> collection <b>devices</b> was not influenced by whether the device was clean or sterile, circumcision of the resident, or duration of time between device application and specimen collection. These data suggest that urine specimens collected by ward nursing staff with <b>external</b> <b>devices</b> are reliable for the diagnosis of bacteriuria in this patient population...|$|R
25|$|As well as medication, {{rehabilitation}} programmes {{and surgical}} interventions, {{the application of}} biomechanical loading on tremor movement {{has been shown to}} be a technique that is able to suppress the effects of tremor on the human body. It has been established in the literature that most of the different types of tremor respond to biomechanical loading. In particular, it has been clinically tested that the increase of damping and/or inertia in the upper limb leads to a reduction of the tremorous motion. Biomechanical loading relies on an <b>external</b> <b>device</b> that either passively or actively acts mechanically in parallel to the upper limb to counteract tremor movement. This phenomenon gives rise to the possibility of an orthotic management of tremor.|$|E
2500|$|An {{electric}} battery is a device consisting {{of one or}} more electrochemical cells with external connections provided to power electrical devices [...] such as flashlights, smartphones, and electric cars. When a battery is supplying electric power, its positive terminal is the cathode and its negative terminal is the anode. The terminal marked negative is the source of electrons that when connected to an external circuit will flow and deliver energy to an <b>external</b> <b>device.</b> When a battery is connected to an external circuit, electrolytes are able to move as ions within, allowing the chemical reactions to be completed at the separate terminals and so deliver energy to the external circuit. It is the movement of those ions within the battery which allows current to flow out of the battery to perform work. Historically the term [...] "battery" [...] specifically referred to a device composed of multiple cells, however the usage has evolved additionally to include devices composed of a single cell.|$|E
