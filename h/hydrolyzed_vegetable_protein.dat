40|$|<b>Hydrolyzed</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>proteins</b> (HVPs) {{are used}} {{throughout}} the world as savoury ingredients, seasoning and flavour enhancers in soups, sauces and ready -to - eat meals. Acid HVPs are commonly produced by hydrochloric acid hydrolysis of proteinaceous, predominantly vegetable materials (such as oil seed meals, wheat or maize gluten) obtained as by-products from edible oil and starch production. Protein peptide bonds are split during the hydrolysis process. Simultaneously, lipids, saccharides and other chemical constituents of the raw material are broken down yielding numerous flavour-active reaction products. The resultant complex chemical mixture includes {{the products of the}} Maillard reactions, Amadori rearrangements and Strecker degradations. The work was terminated by application of the above mentioned results and conclusions on two working trials, when 2 tons of soybean meal hydrolysate and 2 tons of "soup savour" were successfully decontaminated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Feruloylated {{vegetable}} oil {{is a valuable}} green bioproduct that has several cosmeceutical applications associated with its inherent anti-oxidant and ultraviolet-absorption properties. <b>Hydrolyzed</b> <b>vegetable</b> oil by-products can influence product quality and consistency. RESULTS: The formation of by-products by residual water in the enzymatic synthesis of feruloylated {{vegetable oil}} was investigated using chemical theory and experimental studies by monitoring the reaction over a 22 -day period. The hydrolysis of vegetable oil is thermodynamically favored over the hydrolysis of the ethyl ferulate starting material. These results suggest that <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>vegetable</b> oil products will be experimentally observed in greater concentrations compared to hydrolyzed ethyl ferulate products. CONCLUSION: Quantum chemical studies identified several reaction mechanisms that explain the formation of side products by water, suggesting that residual water influences product quality.

Attainment of sexual maturity (age at first egg laid) was 60, 61 and 62 days for SBM, CSC and GNC based diets, respectively while weight of first egg laid was 9. 95, 9. 25 and 9. 40 g, respectively.

The objective of this work was to study an effect of pressure and kind of red bean broth extract on content of total protein, soluble protein and dry solid in the retentate and permeate as <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein</b> used for fortified agent of red bean sauces. Preparation process of <b>hydrolyzed</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>protein</b> was done using fixed rotary speed of 400 rpm, pressure of 20, 25 and 30 psi at room temperature. To investigate the effect of pressure on this separation, the feed were red bean broth extract fermented for 6, 8, 10 and 12 weeks, respectively. Fermentation process were conducted using salt fermentation with inoculum of Rhizopus-C 1, salt and red bean ratios of 30 : 10 : 60 %.
