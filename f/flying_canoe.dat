30|$|The {{cultural}} {{characteristics of}} the Tao tribe, such as the <b>flying</b> fish festival, <b>canoes,</b> and underground houses, are unique to the Tao tribe in Taiwan; other indigenous tribes in Taiwan do not have such cultural features. The flying fish season represents {{the core of the}} life and culture of the Tao tribe; the annual rituals and lifestyles are operated according to the flying fish season. The flying fish season spans from February to August each year, with several important ceremonies taking place during this period, such as mivanwa (flying fish attracting festival) and manoigoyin (end of eating flying fish festival). During the flying fish season, the people are not allowed to catch other than the flying fish and the common dolphinfish; they also have specific regulations for fishing gear and the number of people allowed to fish. During this period, all tribe members must follow traditional norms and avoid violating the related taboos, i.e., must not interfere with the tribe peoples’ lifestyle or affect their personal social status.|$|R
50|$|When French {{settlers}} {{arrived in}} Canada, they swapped stories with the natives and {{the tale of}} Gallery was combined with a First Nations legend about a <b>flying</b> <b>canoe.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Montreal folk metal band Blackguard use {{an image}} of the <b>flying</b> <b>canoe</b> on the cover of their 2009 album Profugus Mortis. Included on the album is a song called [...] "The Last We Wage", whose lyrics are based on this legend.|$|E
60|$|We {{realized}} our danger now and rowed, {{or rather}} paddled, furiously in our {{attempt to get}} out of the vortex. In vain; in another second we were flying straight for the arch like an arrow, and I thought that we were lost. Luckily I retained sufficient presence of mind to shout out, instantly setting the example by throwing myself into the bottom of the canoe, 'Down on your faces -- down!' and the others had the sense to take the hint. In another instant there was a grinding noise, and the boat was pushed down till the water began to trickle over the sides, and I thought that we were gone. But no, suddenly the grinding ceased, and we could again feel the <b>canoe</b> <b>flying</b> along. I turned my head a little -- I dared not lift it -- and looked up. By the feeble light that yet reached the canoe, I could make out that a dense arch of rock hung just over our heads, and that was all. In another minute I could not even see as much as that, for the faint light had merged into shadow, and the shadows had been swallowed up in darkness, utter and complete.|$|R
50|$|Many {{words are}} simply formed by joining {{together}} other words, for example vakalele aeroplane from vaka canoe and lele fly (i.e. literally, <b>flying</b> <b>canoe).</b> Diane Massam has extensively studied a special type of compounding {{which she has}} termed pseudo noun incorporation, a type of noun incorporation.|$|E
5000|$|An earlier {{volume in}} English, {{entitled}} The <b>Flying</b> <b>Canoe</b> (La Chasse-Galerie) {{was written by}} J.E. LeRossignol, by McLelland and Steward Publishers in 1929.

5000|$|One of {{the oldest}} rides at Montreal's La Ronde {{amusement}} park, La Pitoune, uses this legend as inspiration. It is a basic sawmill log ride, but overhead is {{a representation of the}} <b>flying</b> <b>canoe,</b> with the devil perched behind the terrified men. The high bench {{at the back of the}} log-cars is therefore referred to as [...] "the devil-seat." ...|$|E
5000|$|This {{tribute to}} the {{fiddling}} traditions of Canada paying homage to the Anglo-Celtic roots of European Canadian settler culture began {{with the appearance of}} the horned fiddler in a <b>flying</b> <b>canoe,</b> a reference to the story of the Chasse-galerie, where the Devil rode a magical canoe. As the canoe descended from the ceiling, the opening of the song [...] "The Old Ways" [...] was performed by Loreena McKennitt.|$|E
50|$|On New Year's Eve, 1863, Theodore Gilbert meets Jack Murphy, a suave man, while Theodore fears his {{pregnant}} wife may die during delivery. Murphy offers a solution, and Theodore dies. In 1888 in L'Ascension, Quebec, lumberjack Jos Lebel is in a romantic relationship with Theodore's grown daughter Liza Gilbert. Jos {{and a group of}} lumberjacks then set out to work in the Quebec wilderness. The group is eager to spend the holiday with their loved ones, when they meet Murphy, who is really the Devil. The men make a Faustian deal with Murphy to return home, employing a <b>flying</b> <b>canoe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Folktales {{were told}} by Raconteurs, who could tell tales lasting several hours, or even tell a story {{over the course of}} several evenings. Christian beliefs and superstitions are present in most Quebec folklore. La {{chasse-galerie}} (the <b>flying</b> <b>canoe)</b> is a well-known folktale about a group of lumberjacks who make a pact with the devil. Demons, witches, and werewolves were common folk motifs. The tales themselves were referred to by the name contes. The traditional conte form of story-telling has been adapted to the modern novel by writers such as Roch Carrier and Joseph Jean Jacques Ferron. Some folktales are classified under the traditional genre Märchen (fairy tales).|$|E
50|$|After a {{night of}} heavy {{drinking}} on New Year's Eve, a group of voyageurs working at a remote timber camp want to visit their sweethearts some 100 leagues away (300 miles). The {{only way to make}} such a long journey and be back in time for work the next morning is to run the chasse-galerie. Running the chasse-galerie means making a pact with the devil so their canoe can fly through the air to their destination quickly. However, the travellers must not mention God's name or touch the cross of any church steeple as they whisk by in the <b>flying</b> <b>canoe.</b> If either of these rules is broken during the voyage, then the devil will take their souls. To be safe, the men promise not to touch another drop of rum to keep their heads clear. The crew took their places in the canoe which then rises off the ground, and they start to paddle. Far below they see the frozen Gatineau River, many villages, shiny church steeples and then the lights of Montreal. The bewitched canoe eventually touches down near a house where New Year's Eve festivities are in full swing. No one wonders at the trappers'/loggers' sudden arrival. They are embraced with open arms and soon are dancing and celebrating as merrily as everyone else. Soon it is late and the men must leave if they are to get back to camp in time for work. As they fly through the moonless night, it becomes apparent that their navigator had been drinking as he steers the canoe on a dangerously unsteady course. While passing over Montreal they just miss running into a church steeple, and soon after the canoe ends up stuck in a deep snowdrift. At this point the drunken navigator begins swearing and taking the Lord's name in vain. Terrified the devil will take their souls, the men bind and gag their friend and elect another to steer. The navigator soon breaks his bonds and begins swearing again. The crew become more and more shaken at the possibility of losing their souls, and they eventually steer the bewitched canoe right into a tall pine. The men spill out and are knocked unconscious. The ending of the story changes from version to version. Sometimes the men are condemned to fly the canoe through hell and appear in the sky every New Year's Eve, but in all but one version all escape the terms the devil made.|$|E
