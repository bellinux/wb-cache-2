5|$|From {{as early}} as the Preclassic period, the ruler of a Maya polity was {{expected}} to be a distinguished war leader, and was depicted with trophy heads <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> belt. In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives. Right up {{to the end of the}} Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains. Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed. The Spanish recorded that Maya leaders kept track of troop movements in painted books.|$|E
5|$|One night, {{a pair of}} LAPD {{officers}} come in {{to speak}} to Sweetback's boss, Beetle (Simon Chuckster). A black man has been murdered, and there is pressure from the black community {{to bring in a}} suspect. The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback, blame him for the crime, and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence, in order to appease the black community. Beetle agrees, and the officers arrest Sweetback. On the way to the police station, the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu-Mu (Hubert Scales). They handcuff him to Sweetback, but when Mu-Mu insults the officers, they take both men out of the car, undo the handcuff from Mu-Mu's wrist, and beat him. In response, Sweetback uses the handcuffs, still <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wrist, to beat the officers into unconsciousness.|$|E
5|$|Barry is {{described}} as the most famous St. Bernard by the Natural History Museum of Bern. Following his death, his skin was preserved by a taxidermist for the museum, {{while the rest of}} his body was buried. He was originally given a humble and meek pose, as the taxidermist felt that this would serve as a reminder of servitude to future generations. In 1923, his body was refurbished by Georg Ruprecht, as his coat had become brittle and had broken into more than 20 pieces. During the restoration, his body was re-posed and his skull shape was modified to match the shape of the St. Bernard of that time, in a compromise between Ruprecht and the Museum's director. His original head shape was rather flat with a moderate stop, with the modification resulting in a larger head with a more pronounced stop. A barrel was added <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> collar, following the popularization of the myth of the monastery's dogs using these during the rescues, which was originally introduced by Edwin Landseer's work Alpine Mastiffs Reanimating a Distressed Traveller. The barrel was removed in 1978 by Professor Walter Huber, the director of the museum, although it has since been replaced. A monument to Barry is located opposite the entrance to the Cimetière des Chiens in Paris.|$|E

60|$|Her {{companion}} {{was a fine}} Western type of self-made man. He {{was tall}} and broad-shouldered, but walked a little stooping, like a man of fifty. He wore a long Prince Albert frock-coat, <b>hanging</b> loosely <b>from</b> <b>his</b> rather square shoulders. His white vest was noticeably soiled by his watch chain, and his tie was disarranged.|$|R

25|$|While Mel Gibson {{financed the}} film through his Icon Productions, Disney {{signed on to}} {{distribute}} Apocalypto for a fee in certain markets under the Touchstone Pictures label. The publicity for the film started with a December 2005 teaser trailer that was filmed {{before the start of}} principal photography and before Rudy Youngblood was cast as Jaguar Paw. As a joke, Gibson inserted a subliminal cameo of the bearded director in a plaid shirt with a cigarette <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> mouth posing next to a group of dust-covered Maya. A clean-shaven Gibson also filmed a Mayan-language segment for the introduction of the 2006 Academy Awards in which he declined to host the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of 26 August, while the BEF II Corps was engaged at the Battle of Le Cateau, Sir John French had a hostile meeting with Joffre and Lanrezac at Saint-Quentin. Lanrezac was only reluctantly persuaded by {{his chief of staff}} to attend, and before Joffre’s arrival he was {{observed}} loudly criticising both GQG and the BEF, making a poor impression on the junior officer who witnessed it. Lanrezac had his pince nez <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> ear “like a pair of cherries” and gave the impression of being bored whilst Joffre was speaking. However, he assured Joffre that Fifth Army would be ready to counterattack {{as soon as he was}} out into open country where he could use his artillery. French complained of Lanrezac’s behaviour, to which Lanrezac shrugged and gave a vague and academic reply. Joffre stayed for lunch (Lanrezac declined to do so), at which the atmosphere improved, as Joffre confessed that he too was dissatisfied with Lanrezac.|$|E

25|$|Much {{international}} attention was attracted especially {{by the discovery}} of an extremely rare find, a life-sized sandstone statue or stele, dating from the 5th century BC, which was found just outside the larger tumulus. The stele, fully preserved except for its feet, depicts an armed male warrior. It measures 186cm in height and weighs 230kg. It is made from a type of sandstone available within a few kilometres of Glauberg. Much detail is clearly visible: his trousers, composite armour tunic, wooden shield and a typical La Tène sword <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> right side. The moustachioed man wears a torc with three pendants, remarkably {{similar to the one}} from the chamber in mound 1, several rings on both arms and one on the right hand. On his head, he wears a hood-like headdress crowned by two protrusions, resembling the shape of a mistletoe leaf. Such headdresses are also known from a handful of contemporary sculptures. As mistletoe is believed to have held a magical or religious significance to the Celts, it could indicate that the warrior depicted also played the role of a priest. Fragments of three similar statues were also discovered in the area. It is suggested that all four statues once stood in the rectangular enclosure. Perhaps they were associated with an ancestor cult.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Allen pulling up to a junkyard {{in a white}} pickup truck at night, with a watch <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> key chain. [...] Then, Allen takes a power cord {{out of the back}} of the truck and carries it through the junkyard until he plugs it in and flips a switch to turn on a large {{countdown}} clock. [...] As the clock reaches zero, Allen leaves and begins walking away from the camera as the sun rises. [...] Throughout the video, Allen is shown playing both an acoustic guitar and a piano, as well as singing without any instruments.|$|E
500|$|Bligh {{was brought}} to the quarterdeck, his hands bound by a cord held by Christian, who was brandishing a bayonet; some reports {{maintained}} that Christian had a sounding plummet <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> neck so that he could jump overboard and drown himself if the mutiny failed. Others who had been awakened by the noise left their berths and joined in the general pandemonium. It was unclear at this stage who were and who were not active mutineers. Hough describes the scene: [...] "Everyone was, more or less, making a noise, either cursing, jeering or just shouting for the reassurance it gave them to do so". Bligh shouted continually, demanding to be set free, sometimes addressing individuals by name, and otherwise exhorting the company generally to [...] "knock Christian down!" [...] Fryer was briefly permitted on deck to speak to Christian, but was then forced below at bayonet-point; according to Fryer, Christian told him: [...] "I have been in hell for weeks past. Captain Bligh has brought this on himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|The guide paused, {{and looked}} round upon his auditors. Alas! for the sympathy of man--the {{half of them}} had gone to sleep; and Baptiste, for whose benefit the story had been related, lay, or rather sprawled, upon the turf behind the fire, his shaggy head resting on the decayed stump of an old tree, and his empty pipe <b>hanging</b> {{gracefully}} <b>from</b> <b>his</b> half-open mouth. A slight [...] "humph" [...] escaped the worthy guide as he shook the ashes <b>from</b> <b>his</b> pipe, and rolling his blanket round him, laid his head upon the ground.|$|R
50|$|Blech {{warned the}} other pilots {{not to follow}} him into the same cloud and took an aero-tow from Walter Horten in their Focke-Wulf Fw 56 glider tug. After {{entering}} the cloud, several other pilots ignored Blechs warning, including Scheidhauer, and {{followed him into the}} large thundercloud. Several less adventurous pilots left the cloud almost immediately, but Scheidhauer's H.IIIa was severely damaged by hail and was seen fluttering to the ground closely followed by Scheidhauer <b>hanging</b> unconscious <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parachute, suffering <b>from</b> severe frostbite.|$|R
60|$|Rollo saw {{him through}} the kitchen window, and {{he opened the door}} and ran out a moment to see him. Jonas was cutting away very {{carefully}} all around the sides of the tub, so as to get the whole mass of ice out together. Rollo stood looking on, shivering. He had no hat on, and only slippers upon his feet. He stood leaning a little forward, <b>his</b> arms <b>hanging</b> off <b>from</b> <b>his</b> sides as if they were driven off by electric repulsion.|$|R
500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling his fly fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, {{he walks to the}} river with a net <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E
500|$|In {{south-east}} Essex, Murrell {{was known}} as [...] "The Devil's Master", a title that he himself used as a self-description. He cultivated an air of mystery about himself by keeping himself largely apart from wider community life, speaking seldom, and traveling largely at night. His house was locally known as a [...] "place to avoid" [...] and those visiting him reportedly often waited for some time outside, plucking {{up the courage to}} enter. Within the cottage, Murrell had drying herbs <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> ceiling, and his devices were reported to include a crystal, a mirror, and a bowl of water. Other items that Murrell used in his magical practices were [...] a copper charm with which he would allegedly distinguish whether an individual was lying or not, and a [...] "trick" [...] telescope that supposedly enabled him [...] "to see through brick walls". The latter device was examined by an acquaintance of Murrell's, who deemed it to be [...] "a clumsily home-made arrangement of bits of looking-glass, such as might once have been bought at a toy-shop". Murrell possessed a library of books, including works on astrology and astronomy, conjuration, and medical texts. He also wrote a number of personal notebooks containing information on such topics, the last of which survived into at least the 1950s.|$|E
2500|$|The 1° Gruppo C.T. of the ANR, {{based at}} the Campoformido airfield, was {{equipped}} with C.205. Its first operation, on 3 January, began with a surprise blow right away: the Italian fighter pilots shot down [...] four P-38 Lightnings. By 25 February, 1° Gruppo C.T. had reported 26 victories for nine losses. An extremely bitter aerial combat took place on 11 March. The Italians claimed 12 victories for themselves, but lost three of their own pilots, including 1st Lt Boscutti, who was killed by an American P-38 Lightning pilot after he had bailed out from his stricken fighter and was <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parachute. On 18 March, 30 C.205s from 1° Gruppo C.T. and 60 Bf 109 from JG.77 joined combat with about 450 Allied bombers and their escorts, shooting down at least four enemy aircraft, but Corp. Zaccaria was killed while <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parachute again by a P-38 pilot who fired at him from close range.|$|E
6000|$|... 'There's Julius!' and he half {{rose to his}} feet, motioning to the newcomer. The girl, with a curious, almost evil motion, looked round {{over her}} {{shoulder}} without moving her body. Gerald watched her dark, soft hair swing over her ears. He felt her watching intensely {{the man who was}} approaching, so he looked too. He saw a pale, full-built young man with rather long, solid fair hair <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> under <b>his</b> black hat, moving cumbrously down the room, his face lit up with a smile at once naive and warm, and vapid. He approached towards Birkin, with a haste of welcome.|$|R

5000|$|Idler {{dreamed of}} flying, and {{constructed}} {{a set of}} wings that he would ride while <b>hanging</b> suspended <b>from</b> <b>his</b> arms. [...] He made one attempt at flying, originally planning on launching himself from the Perlachturm, a 70-meter tower {{in the center of}} Augsburg, but the clergyman was able to convince him to start at a lower level. In the attempt he was unable to control his descent, and fell onto a bridge. He survived, but four chickens under the bridge were killed when it collapsed.|$|R
2500|$|The antlered {{figure in}} plate A has been {{commonly}} identified as Cernunnos, who is named (the only {{source for the}} name) on the 1st-century Gallo-Roman Pillar of the Boatmen, where he is shown as an antlered figure with torcs <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> antlers. [...] Possibly the lost portion below his bust showed him seated cross-legged as the figure on the cauldron is. [...] Otherwise {{there is evidence of}} a horned god from several cultures.|$|E
2500|$|Steven Tyler (born Steven Victor Tallarico; March 26, 1948) is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, {{and former}} {{television}} music competition judge, {{best known as}} the lead singer of the Boston-based rock band Aerosmith, in which he also plays the harmonica, and occasional piano and percussion. He is known as the [...] "Demon of Screamin'" [...] due to his high screams and his wide vocal range. He is also known for his on-stage acrobatics. During his high-energy performances, Tyler usually dresses in bright, colorful outfits with his trademark scarves <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> microphone stand.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Static Age {{sessions}} the Misfits began a {{shift in}} songwriting and appearance, with Danzig writing more songs inspired by B horror and science fiction films. He painted skeletal patterns on his performance clothing, while Only began applying dark makeup around his eyes and styling his hair in a long point <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> forehead between his eyes and down to his chin, a style that became known as a [...] "devilock" [...] and which both Danzig and Only's brother Doyle would eventually adopt. This new style and musical direction would later {{be described as the}} subgenre [...] "horror punk".|$|E
60|$|Every {{member of}} that party seemed to be quite {{contented}} and amiable, but no one showed much inclination to talk, and ere many minutes had passed, half their number were under their blankets, their heads pillowed on their bundles and their eyes sealed in sleep.

50|$|An {{addition}} to the Rocket Man back-pack and helmet, used {{for the first time}} in this serial, is a two-way radio about the size of a lunchbox; Larry Martin wears it <b>hanging</b> heavily <b>from</b> <b>his</b> belt when dressed for flying. This radio is also seen in some stills of Cody in Commando Cody: Sky Marshal of the Universe. As most flying sequences are reused stock footage from earlier Rocket Man serials, the radio usually disappears when Commando Cody is in flight. Martin also uses an ordinary police revolver instead of the ray gun favored by Cody in earlier and later serials.|$|R
5000|$|Hypnos {{appears in}} {{numerous}} works of art, {{most of which}} are vases. An example of one vase that Hypnos is featured on is called [...] "Ariadne Abandoned by Theseus," [...] {{which is part of the}} Museum of Fine Arts in Boston’s collection. In this vase, Hypnos is shown as a winged god dripping Lethean water upon the head of Ariadne as she sleeps. One of the most famous works of art featuring Hypnos is a bronze head of Hypnos himself, now kept in the British Museum in London. This bronze head has wings sprouting <b>from</b> <b>his</b> temples and the hair is elaborately arranged, some tying in knots and some <b>hanging</b> freely <b>from</b> <b>his</b> head.|$|R
2500|$|Joe Clark's {{rapid rise}} from a {{relatively}} unknown Alberta MP to the Leader of the Opposition took much of Canada by surprise. The Toronto Star announced Clark's victory with a headline that read [...] "Joe Who?", giving Clark a nickname that stuck for years. Much joking {{was made of}} Clark's clumsiness and awkward mannerisms. Skinny and tall, he became a frequent target for editorial cartoonists, who delighted in portraying him {{as a sort of}} walking candy apple, with an enormous head and floppy dog-like ears; cartoonist Andy Donato typically drew Clark with mittens on strings <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> suit sleeves. Initially, it seemed unlikely that a man who was the source of so much mockery could ever hope to compete against the confident and intellectual Pierre Trudeau. It also did not help that the Progressive Conservatives lost a string of by-elections on May 24, 1977.|$|E
2500|$|The Prado {{version is}} set at dawn and shows the young Adonis pulling himself away from Venus, his lover. [...] He carries a {{feathered}} spear or [...] "dart", a weapon often used in hunting in the 16th century. The leads of his three hounds are wound around his arm at right. Under the trees behind them at left Cupid lies asleep, with his bow and quiver of arrows hanging from a tree; {{this is not a}} time for love. [...] High in the sky, a figure rides a chariot; this is either Venus from later in the story, or Apollo or Sol, representing the dawn. [...] Venus sits on a rock covered with a rich tablecloth with gold braid edges and buttons (not a military jacket, as sometimes thought). [...] Adonis has a horn <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> belt; his dress is classical, taken from Roman sculptures.|$|E
2500|$|In contrast, Andrew Graham-Dixon {{finds the}} {{painting}} [...] "in its quiet, understated way, {{one of the}} masterpieces of erotic painting"; Robert's [...] "clothes are almost falling off him, they are so loose and floppy" [...] while Frances [...] "has a melted, langourous look about her". [...] For Erica Langmuir it is [...] "the most tartly lyrical picture {{in the history of}} art. Mr Andrew's satisfaction in his well-kept farmlands is as nothing to the intensity of the painter's feeling for the gold and green of fields and copses, the supple curves of fertile land meeting the stately clouds". [...] She notes the visual [...] "rhymes and assonances" [...] that link elements of the composition: the skirt with the bench back, Mrs Andrews' shoes with its feet and Mr Andrews' with the tree roots, and [...] "the lines of gun, thighs, dog, calf, coat". His hanging coat tail relates to the ribbon <b>hanging</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wife's hat.|$|E
60|$|On {{the other}} side of the fireplace, in the horse-hair arm-chair where Mrs Verloc’s mother was {{generally}} privileged to sit, Karl Yundt giggled grimly, with a faint black grimace of a toothless mouth. The terrorist, as he called himself, was old and bald, with a narrow, snow-white wisp of a goatee <b>hanging</b> limply <b>from</b> <b>his</b> chin. An extraordinary expression of underhand malevolence survived in his extinguished eyes. When he rose painfully the thrusting forward of a skinny groping hand deformed by gouty swellings suggested the effort of a moribund murderer summoning all his remaining strength for a last stab. He leaned on a thick stick, which trembled under his other hand.|$|R
5000|$|The relief {{depicts a}} male figure, about 1.75 m high, whose {{clothing}} and weapons identify {{him as a}} warrior. In his outstretched right hand he holds a (badly weathered) spear. His left hand holds his bow which is borne over his shoulder. On {{the left side of}} his body there is a sword - the halfmoon grip and a loop for <b>hanging</b> it <b>from</b> <b>his</b> belt are clearly visible. He is dressed in a semi-circular cap with decorative bands, a short kilt and the ubiquitous Hittite pointed shoes. A large ring hangs <b>from</b> <b>his</b> ear. To the right of the image are two groups of Luwian hieroglyphs, one above the other. According to John David Hawkins' translation, they name the figure as: ...|$|R
6000|$|Raying {{and gleaming}} in the {{sunlight}} the hired landau {{drove up to the}} gate. Lawford, peeping between the blinds, looked down on the coachman, with reins <b>hanging</b> loosely <b>from</b> <b>his</b> red squat-thumbed hand, seated in his tight livery and indescribable hat on the faded cushions. One thing only was in his mind; and it was almost with an audible cry that he turned towards the figure that edged, white and trembling, into the chill room, to fling herself into his arms. 'Don't look at me,' he begged her, 'only remember, dearest, I would rather have died down there and been never seen again than have given you pain. Run--run, your mother's calling. Write to me, think of me; good-bye!' ...|$|R
