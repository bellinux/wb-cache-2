He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to head back to his seat as the stillness held.|$|E
5|$|The Vishnu sculptures {{found among}} the Elephanta ruins express {{different}} styles. One wears a dhoti and has a looped girdle, while holding a conch at an angle near his thigh. The remnants of <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> suggest that this was likely a four arm iconography. Another statue has elements of Shiva and Vishnu. It was identified to be Shiva by Pramod Chandra, as Kartikeya by Moti Chandra, and as Vishnu by others. It shows a chain link near the thigh, has a gada (mace) on side, and someone {{standing next to him}} of a damaged upper portion but with small waist and full breasts suggestive of a devi. This statue too is wearing a dhoti.|$|E

He does, in fact, say the Pledge and sometimes led the Senate in doing so.|$|E
25|$|Prince {{made his}} Test debut in February 2002, against Australia at the Wanderers. His {{inclusion}} in the side was {{partly due to the}} quota system in South Africa. He however justified his spot in the side by making 49 and top scoring. In the third Test at Durban he narrowly missed out on a half century again but his 48 was influential in <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> victory.|$|E

25|$|With the UK {{success of}} Family's first two albums, the band {{undertook}} {{a tour of}} the United States in April 1969, but it was beset by problems. Halfway through the tour, Grech unexpectedly left the band to join the new supergroup Blind Faith; on the recommendation of tour manager Peter Grant, Grech was replaced by John Weider, previously of Eric Burdon and The Animals. A further setback occurred during their first concert at Bill Graham's Fillmore East, whilst sharing the bill with Ten Years After and The Nice – during his stage routine, Chapman lost control of his microphone stand, which flew in Graham's direction, an act Graham took to be deliberate; Chapman performed the following shows with his hands by <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> {{and by the end of}} the tour he had lost his voice; Family's reputation in the US never recovered and they ultimately never achieved great recognition there.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have looked}} less favourably on MacLaren as a captain. When he assumed the {{leadership}} of England, the press were reporting on the tactical performance of captains for the first time. MacLaren {{was among the first}} captains to study tactics. However, judgements on his effectiveness have varied greatly. For most of his career, he was regarded as an excellent captain. Contemporaries praised his tactical awareness; he planned minutely, and organised his fields extremely carefully to prevent batsmen scoring through blocking their favourite shots, a technique practically unheard of at the time. He liked to alter the batting order, a tactic which often divides critics, although it frequently succeeded for MacLaren. He was less successful in managing his team. Regarded as a pessimist, he openly showed disappointment at the composition of <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> and became downcast when the course of the match was running against him. Some of those who played under him thought that <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> were unhappy ones which operated without joy and solely concentrated on winning. He encountered many difficulties over selection; he often promoted cricketers whom he considered to show potential and consequently railed against committees which did not provide him with the players he wanted. Down suggests that MacLaren was usually correct, being more experienced and a better judge than most of those who chose the teams. Peter Wynne-Thomas describes MacLaren's approach to selection as [...] "unorthodox", and writes that while his ideas were sometimes successful, they failed badly at other times. Apart from his own failings, MacLaren had a reputation as an unlucky captain, both in terms of losing important players to injury and illness before vital games, and in the frequency with which he lost the toss before a match. Nor was MacLaren particularly popular; in later years, several people for whom he had been a hero changed their opinion once they met him.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the middle}} of {{political}} disorders of the late 18th century, Norwich intellectual life flourished. It contained one, so far unmentioned characteristic: Harriet Martineau wrote of the city's literati of the period, which included such people as William Taylor, {{one of the first}} German scholars in England. The city [...] "boasted of her intellectual supper-parties, where, amidst a pedantry which would now make laughter hold both <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> there was much that was pleasant and salutary: and finally she called herself The Athens of England." ...|$|E

2500|$|After an {{incident}} in Washington in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential swimming pool with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a [...] "suicide dive" [...] (his hands at <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> – so his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and became a tetraplegic. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute over the inappropriate depth of the pool.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the proof}} of a winning {{strategy}} for the first player, {{it is known that}} the hex board must have a complex type of connectivity which has never been solved. Play consists of creating small patterns which have a simpler type of connectivity called [...] "safely connected", and joining them into sequences that form a [...] "path". Eventually, one of the players will succeed in forming a safely connected path of stones and spaces between <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> of the board and win. [...] The final stage of the game, if necessary, consists of filling in the empty spaces in the path.|$|E

Over this, he wears a simple grey [...] jacket whose only decoration is a flower motif [...] family crest, which may be a plum blossom variant. His arms have been removed from the sleeves of his haori which hang down at <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> and he has a sageo string holding back the long sleeves of his kimono. Both of these are intended to increase his mobility, particularly in combat.|$|E

He dreams of [...] "living off the fatta' the lan'" [...] {{and being able}} to tend to rabbits. His love for soft things conspires against him, mostly because he does not know his own strength, and eventually becomes his undoing. Steinbeck defines his appearance as George's [...] "opposite," [...] writing that he is a [...] "huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes" [...] and [...] "wide, sloping shoulders." [...] Lennie walks heavily, dragging his feet a little, [...] "the way a bear drags his paws," [...] adding that his arms do not swing at <b>his</b> <b>sides,</b> but hang loosely.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the third}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), the man Adam named all the animals, but found no fitting helper. So God cast {{a deep sleep}} upon the man and took one of <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> and {{fashioned}} it into a woman and {{brought her to the}} man. The man declared her bone of his bones and flesh of his flesh, and called her woman. Thus a man leaves his parents and clings to his wife, so that they become one flesh. The man and the woman were naked, but felt no shame. The serpent ( [...] , nachash), the shrewdest of the beasts, asked the woman whether God had really forbidden her to eat any of the fruit in the garden. The woman replied that they could eat any fruit other than that of the tree {{in the middle of the}} garden, which God had warned them neither to eat nor to touch, on pain of death.|$|E
2500|$|After having {{appeared}} for {{the club}} as a player, Cruyff returned to Barcelona for the 1988–89 season, this time to take up his new role {{as coach of the}} first team. Before returning to Barcelona, however, Cruyff had already built up plenty of experience as a coach/manager. In the Netherlands, he was strongly praised for the attacking flair he imposed on <b>his</b> <b>sides</b> and also for his commendable work as talent spotter, discovering, for example Marco van Basten and Dennis Bergkamp. With Barça, Cruyff started work with a completely remodelled side after the previous season's scandal, known as the [...] "Hespereria Mutiny". His second in command was Carles Rexach, who had already been at the club for a year. Cruyff immediately had his Barça charges playing his attractive brand of football and the results did not take long in coming. But, this did not just happen with the first team, the youth teams also displayed that same attacking style, something that made it easier for reserve players to make the switch to first team football. As Sid Lowe noted, when Cruyff took over as manager, Barcelona of the late 1980s [...] "were a club in debt and in crisis. Results were bad, performances were worse, the atmosphere terrible and attendances down, while even the relationship between the president of the club Josep Lluís Núñez {{and the president of the}} Spanish autonomous community they represented, Jordi Pujol, had deteriorated. It did not work immediately but he [...] recovered the identity he had embodied as a player. He took risks, and rewards followed." ...|$|E
50|$|In the 2009-10 season, he led Northwich to the Second Round of the FA Cup, a {{considerable}} achievement, and saw <b>his</b> <b>side</b> defeat former Premier League side Charlton Athletic in the process.

In spite of relegation and financial uncertainty, he stayed at the club along with his assistant Andy Morrison.|$|R
