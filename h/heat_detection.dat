5000|$|Schistosoma intercalatum's {{life cycle}} {{is very similar}} to that of S. haematobium, except for some key differences. To start the life cycle, the human host {{releases}} eggs with its feces. In water, the eggs hatch to become miracidia, which penetrate the freshwater snail intermediate host. S. intercalatum has two major strains, each with its own preferred bulinid host. The Zaire strain will use Bulinus africanus, while the Lower Guinea strain will use the extremely common B. forskalii as its intermediate host. The miracidia penetrate the snail tissue, and inside they become sporocysts and multiply. The sporocysts then mature into cercariae inside the snail host and are ready to leave. The cercariae are free-swimming in the surrounding water until they find their definitive host: a human. If there is a small temperature change, the cercariae of S. intercalatum will form concentrated aggregates near the surface of the water. This mechanism for body <b>heat</b> <b>detection</b> of a potential host restricts the formation of viable cercariae to small streams and slow moving bodies of water because of their high sensitivity.|$|E

We hypothesized, that clonidine used as an adjuvant to ropivacaine extends the duration of an adductor canal block (ACB) by a peripheral mechanism, compared to ropivacaine alone when controlling for systemic effects. We conducted a paired, blinded, randomized trial in healthy volunteers. Participants received bilateral ACBs containing 20 ml ropivacaine 0. 5 % + 1 ml clonidine 150 μg/ml in one leg and 20 ml ropivacaine 0. 5 % + 1 ml saline in the other leg. The primary outcome measure was duration of sensory block assessed by temperature sensation (alcohol swab). Secondary outcome measures were duration of sensory block assessed by: pinprick, maximum pain during tonic <b>heat</b> stimulation, warmth <b>detection</b> threshold and <b>heat</b> pain <b>detection</b> threshold. We enrolled 21 volunteers and all completed the trial. There was no difference in duration of sensory block assessed with an alcohol swab: Mean duration in the leg receiving ropivacaine + clonidine was 19. 4 h (SD 2. 7) compared to 19. 3 h (SD 2. 4) in the leg receiving ropivacaine + placebo with a mean difference of 0. 1 h (95 % CI: - 1. 0 to 1. 3), P = 0. 83.

50|$|Vampire bats are {{sensitive}} to power densities (a measure of emitted energy) greater than 50 µW/cm2 at distances between 13 and 16 cm (a power density of 1.8x10−4W/cm2 corresponds to 50 °C). This was first determined by quantifying the temperature at which vampire bats could not behaviorally distinguish between heat emitting and room temperature SUs. A positive linear relationship exists between the energy-threshold of <b>heat</b> <b>detection</b> and distance from stimuli. Through mathematical calculations, {{at a distance of}} 8 cm, vampire bats should be able to detect humans who emit radiation of 80 µW/cm2. Temperature threshold measurements were directly measured by stimulating nerve fibers of thermoreceptors in the nose-leaf and upper lip with a water-circulated brass thermode and recording the impulses/second at every 5 °C shift in temperature from 10 to 40 °C. These receptors have a threshold of 28 °C and a maximum temperature response to 40 °C, beyond which there was either no firing or an irregular firing pattern. This threshold is 8 °C lower compared to those of warm receptor in other species of mammals, which implies extreme sensitivity to heat. After stimulation of these receptors, there is a transient increase in impulse activity which quickly decays due to adaptation and thus strengthens temporal acuity.|$|E

50|$|The Chenani-Nashri tunnel {{comprises}} two tubes {{that run}} parallel {{to each other}} — the main traffic tunnel of diameter 13 m and a separate safety or escape tunnel of diameter 6 m alongside. The two tubes — each approximately 9 km long — are connected by 29 cross passages at regular intervals of every 300 meters along {{the entire length of the}} tunnel. These passages add up to about 1 km of tunnel length, and the main and escape tubes, plus the cross passages make up about 19 km of tunnel length. Since such a long tunnel could present the problem of a lack of oxygen, to ensure that there is no excessive carbon-dioxide build-up inside, there are several exhaust meters that will check the air all through the length of the tunnel. With inlets, every 8 meters, bringing fresh air into the main tube, and exhaust outlets every 100 m opening into the escape tube, the tunnel is the country’s first — and the world’s sixth — road tunnel with a transverse ventilation system. Transverse ventilation will keep tailpipe smoke inside the tunnel at a minimum level in order to prevent suffocation and keep visibility at acceptable levels, especially since the tunnel is so long. The 29 cross passages between the two tunnels will be used to evacuate, through the escape tunnel, a user who might be in distress or to tow away any vehicle that might have broken down in the main tunnel. A total of 124 cameras and a linear <b>heat</b> <b>detection</b> system inside the tunnel will alert the Integrated Tunnel Control Room (ITCR) located outside the tunnel to the need for intervention.

The clinical study consisted of 2 parts: part 1 assessed pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, including <b>heat</b> pain <b>detection</b> threshold and <b>heat</b> pain tolerance, of JNJ- 39439335, and part 2 assessed pharmacodynamic effect of JNJ- 39439335 on capsaicin-induced flare and sensory testing on naïve and UVB-sensitized skin in humans. Plasma concentrations of JNJ- 39439335 peaked at approximately 2 to 4 hours postdose, then declined multiexponentially, with a prolonged terminal phase (half-life: 30 – 86 hours). Renal clearance of JNJ- 39439335 was negligible. JNJ- 39439335 treatment resulted in clear, consistent dose-related increases in <b>heat</b> pain <b>detection</b> threshold, <b>heat</b> pain tolerance, and heat pain latency. JNJ- 39439335 reduced the capsaicin-induced flare area and flare intensity, with complete blocking observed in the 50 -mg dose group at 144 hours postdose. This was consistent with the capsaicin flare results observed with JNJ- 39439335 in rats. The most common adverse events observed in the clinical study were related to increases in body temperature after JNJ- 39439335 treatment; these were predominately mild to moderate in severity with no evidence of exposure dependence up to 225 mg.
