40|$|ABSTRACT. We studied seven {{hydropower}} license consultations {{to examine}} {{the role of a}} sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to reach agreement. Hydropower licensing consultations were studied because the statutory requirement for consultation encourages negotiation, all such consultations are similar, and a negotiated settlement is not a foregone result. Cases selected for analysis met screening criteria. Structured interviews were conducted with participants after the negotiations had been concluded. Respondent recollections were checked against the documentary record. A sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to reach agreement was a significant factor in the completion of these negotiations; where there was no shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> purposeful delay adversely affected the negotiations. Although a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> was experienced by at least one party in each case, only a shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> {{at the end of the}} process proved significant. Delay did not prevent ultimate agreement but a shared sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> brought speedier agreement and greater satisfaction with the negotiation...|$|R

This exploratory study examined the relationship between superintendents' perceived sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and student academic performance. More specifically, the study examined the leadership of Missouri superintendents based upon a district's Annual Performance Report. The Missouri Annual Performance Report ranks districts from highest to lowest with the following designations: performance with distinction; full waiver; limited waiver; provisionally accredited; and, unaccredited. This study focused only on the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in the districts performing with distinction, performing with a full waiver, and performing with a limited waiver due to limited sample size in the lower levels of provisionally accredited and unaccredited. A total of 98 superintendents in Missouri were included in this study. Quantitative data were collected using survey responses. Superintendents responded to items about their perceptions of their own sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance, the source <b>of</b> their <b>urgency,</b> their purposeful communication <b>of</b> <b>urgency,</b> their perceptions <b>of</b> change <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> in district stakeholders, and the strategies used to communicate the urgency. Data from the surveys were analyzed using analysis of variance, analysis of covariance, and step-wise linear regression. Superintendents in districts performing with a limited waiver reported a significantly stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance than did superintendents in districts performing with distinction {{at the end of the}} first year in their position as superintendent. Superintendents in districts with a limited waiver also reported a significantly stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance than did superintendents in districts performing with distinction at the time of the survey. Superintendents in districts with a limited waiver purposefully communicated significantly more often than superintendents in districts performing with distinction with boards of education. In addition, superintendents in districts with a limited waiver purposefully communicated significantly more frequently with all district teachers than superintendents in districts performing with distinction. Superintendents leading districts performing with a limited waiver and superintendents leading districts with a full waiver identified an impending crisis to communicate a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance significantly more often than superintendents leading districts performing with distinction. Through regression analysis, Providing Opportunities for Success, Identifying an Impending Crisis, Setting Goals and Targets, and Utilizing Data were communication strategies significantly associated with the degree to which the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student academic performance increased throughout the district. Regression findings also implied that utilizing the communication strategy "providing opportunities for success" could increase the sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> for boards <b>of</b> education, district administrators, building principals, teacher leaders, all district teachers and the media. Throughout this study it was evident that superintendents leading districts with a limited waiver, which indicates lower student academic performance, reported a stronger sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student achievement than did their counterparts in higher performing districts. These superintendents purposefully communicated a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> more often and they used the communication strategy of "identifying an impending crisis" more frequently to increase a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> across their districts than did superintendents in districts with higher student performance. In addition, when superintendents utilize the communication strategy of "providing opportunities for success," which includes actions such as articulating a vision and implementing a purposeful school improvement process, an increase in a sense <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> to improve student achievement is more likely to occur...|$|R

40|$|The {{variation}} in the acoustic structure of alarm calls appears to convey information about the level <b>of</b> response <b>urgency</b> in some species, while in others it seems to denote the type of predator. While theoretical models and studies on species with functionally referential calls have emphasized that any animal signal considered to have an external referent also includes motivational content, to our knowledge, no empirical study {{has been able to}} show this. In this paper, I present an example of a graded alarm call system that combines referential information and also information on the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> Acoustically different alarm calls in the social mongoose Suricata suricatta are given in response to different predator types, but their call structure also varies depending on the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> Low urgency calls tend to be harmonic across all predator types, while high urgency calls are noisier. There was less evidence for consistency in the acoustic parameters assigned to particular predator types across different levels <b>of</b> <b>urgency.</b> This suggests that, while suricates convey information about the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> along a general rule, the referential information about each category of predator type is not encoded in an obvious way...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In recent years, {{there has}} been a growth in the use of triage nurses to {{decrease}} general practitioner (GP) workloads and increase the efficiency of telephone triage. The actual safety of decisions made by triage nurses has not yet been assessed. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether triage nurses accurately estimate the <b>urgency</b> level <b>of</b> health complaints when using the national telephone guidelines, and {{to examine the relationship between}} the performance of triage nurses and their education and training. Method: A cross-sectional, multicentre, observational study employing five mystery (simulated) patients who telephoned triage nurses in four GP cooperatives. The mystery patients played standardised roles. Each role had one <b>of</b> four <b>urgency</b> levels as determined by experts. The triage nurses called were asked to estimate the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> after the contact. This level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> was compared with a gold standard. RESULTS: Triage nurses estimated the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> 69 % of the 352 contacts correctly and underestimated the level <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> <b>of</b> 19 % of the contacts. The sensitivity and specificity <b>of</b> the <b>urgency</b> estimates provided by the triage nurses were found to be 0. 76 and 0. 95, respectively. The positive and negative predictive values <b>of</b> the <b>urgency</b> estimates were 0. 83 and 0. 93, respectively. A significant correlation was found between correct estimation <b>of</b> <b>urgency</b> and specific training on the use of the guidelines. The educational background (primary or secondary care) of the nurses had no significant relationship with the rate of underestimation. CONCLUSION: Telephone triage by triage nurses is efficient but possibly not safe, with potentially severe consequences for the patient. An educational programme for triage nurses is recommended. Also, a direct second safety check of all cases by a specially trained GP telephone doctor is advisable...|$|R
