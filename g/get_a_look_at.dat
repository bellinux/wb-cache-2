25|$|In 1990, Griffin had {{an ambitious}} but {{unsuccessful}} attempt at adapting the venerable board game Monopoly {{into a game}} show of the same name. His last game show was a wild game show called Ruckus, which emanated from the Resorts International Hotel & Casino in Atlantic City, which he owned at the time. Involving slapstick stunts and a somewhat truncated version of his old Reach for the Stars, the show initially aired locally in New York, {{with the intent of}} national syndication early the following year. The Amazing Johnathan left the show after 65 episodes because of a contract dispute and the show was scrapped before it was to be nationally syndicated. A national audience did <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, via reruns that aired for a time on GSN.|$|E

500|$|Dark Horse Comics {{approached}} {{creative director}} Neil Druckmann, {{who was working}} on The Last of Us, to produce a tie-in comic book series for the game. Druckmann was initially wary of the idea, but eventually agreed when he realized Dark Horse [...] "didn't {{want to do something}} tangential" [...] with the opportunity of expanding their characters and universe beyond the game. Work on the comic began during the game's development, which allowed the stories of the two projects to integrate, and influence each other. Druckmann requested webcomic artist Faith Erin Hicks as a collaborator on the project, after reading her comic Friends with Boys (2012) and appreciating [...] "how personal it felt". He also felt that Hicks could capture the [...] "gritty" [...] feel of the game. Hicks then sent some concept art to Dark Horse as a pitch for the job; they accepted, and she became officially involved with the project. Hicks was drawn to the project after reading about the character of Ellie in the game's script; she considered Ellie an unusual character to include in a survival horror game, calling her a [...] "tough teenage girl who wasn't sexualized, and who seemed very much the equal of her male counterpart". Hicks was given access to various gameplay sequences and the game's script during development, to allow her to better understand the story. She was also given videos of the actors performing on set, which was helpful when illustrating the characters. [...] "I <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> these characters and I see them interacting as human beings, not just as concept art," [...] said Hicks.|$|E

2500|$|Gotti and Gravano {{arrived at}} the {{restaurant}} shortly before 5 o'clock and, after circling the block, parked their car across the intersection and within view of the entrance. Around 5:30, Gravano spotted Castellano's Lincoln Town Car stopped at a nearby intersection and, via walkie talkie, alerted the team of hitmen stationed outside the restaurant of Castellano's approach. Castellano's driver, Thomas Bilotti, pulled the car up {{directly in front of}} the entrance. As Castellano and Bilotti exited the Lincoln, the roughly half dozen shooters moved in and opened fire, killing both men in a barrage of bullets. As the hat-and-trench-coat-adorned men slipped away into the night, Gotti calmly drove the car past the front of the restaurant to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the scene. Looking down at Bilotti's body from the passenger window, Gravano remarked, [...] "He's gone." ...|$|E

5000|$|Much of Willoughby's {{popularity}} {{stemmed from}} {{his ability to}} capture film stars in unguarded moments of repose and vulnerability.
