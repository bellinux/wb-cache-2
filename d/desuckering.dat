40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} was to study the influence of three selective levels of sucker pruning namely: (mother + 2 followers, mother + 3 followers and mother + 4 followers) on growth and yield of the banana compared to the traditional farmer practice (without pruning management). The results revealed {{a significant reduction in}} growth and yield parameters of banana plant with increase in number of suckers left with the mother plant. The treatments did not display significant variation in the time to shooting and pseudostem girth in the first cycle but significant effect was shown in the second cycle. The effect was clearly observed when no <b>desuckering</b> was practiced. Generally the high productivity associated with <b>desuckering</b> was mostly due to the high number of hands per bunch and the large fruit size...|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} is conducted {{at a private}} banana farm in Lata Janggut. Five treatments with different water sucker densities (ranged from 0 to 4), were examined to study their effect on the growth and development of banana plant, Musa acuminata cv (Berangan', established from the water sucker. The {{results indicated that the}} vegetative growth parameter of pseudostem's height and pseudostem's upper girth were significantly influenced, whereas the parameter of psudostem's centre girth, pseudostem's bottom girth and number of green leaves were not significantly influenced by the water sucker density. The treatment 4 consisting of 3 water sucker density had shown numerical influence on growth and development such as the emergence of flower and fruit, of `Berangan' banana as compared to other treatments. Hence, the water sucker density applied in treatment 4 can be recommended during <b>desuckering</b> for banana planting...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{pineapple}} (Ananas sativus syn. Ananas Comosus Merr) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important commercial tropical fruits of the world. Among the 6 agro-climatic zones of West Bengal, Darjeeling District comes under Terai and Hill zone. Some Block of Darjeeling district has a huge potential for pineapple cultivation owing to the fertile soil and conducive agro-climatic conditions (average Rain fall and average Temperature). To increase the production per unit area different agency including State and Central department of Agriculture, has disseminated different technology in the region where the study has been made. The present study was conducted during March ’ 2012 to June’ 2012 at Phansidewa Block of Darjeeling District in West Bengal where the pineapple cultivation is prevalent. The objective of the study was to identify technological gap in pineapple cultivation, and to measure relationship of different socio-economic, socio-psychological and extension-communication variables with technological gap of respondents. The District, Block, Gram Panchayats, Villages and respondents were selected purposively. Data have been collected through well structured schedule followed by interview method and result have been analyzed by descriptive statistics, co-efficient of correlation and multiple regression analysis by taking technological gap as dependent variable and other fifteen variables as independent variables. After analyzing the data, it was found the highest technological gaps were in treatment of planting material, <b>desuckering,</b> fertilizer application and micro nutrient application and no gap was found in case of regulation of flowering, protection against su...|$|E
40|$|East African {{highland}} cooking banana (Musa spp., ‘Matooke’, AAA-EA genome) {{prices are}} sensitive to supply dynamics given their perishable nature. Despite large temporal fluctuations in farm-gate prices and food security, no efforts {{have been made to}} shift banana production towards periods of high banana prices and low food security. This study evaluated the influence of sucker emergence period on harvest period and yield, with the aim of proposing alternative <b>desucker</b> management that could shift production towards low supply periods. 150 AAA-EA (‘Enyeru’) mats were selected on ten farms in Ntungamo district (southwestern Uganda). Under farmer management, the mats were researcher-monitored weekly from 2005 to 2007 to record dates of sucker emergence, flowering and harvest and bunch weight. Date records were respectively grouped into quarters that corresponded to dry (Q 1 : December–February; Q 3 : June–August) and wet seasons (Q 2 : March–May; Q 4 : September–November). Harvest peaks occurred in Q 3 and Q 4 due to the significantly (P< 0. 05) larger numbers of suckers that emerged in Q 4 and early Q 1 compared {{to the rest of the}} year. Few bunches were harvested in Q 1 due to low sucker emergence in late Q 1 of the preceding year. By the time farmers <b>desuckered</b> after the wet season, suckers that emerged late Q 1 were likely to be removed because they appeared smaller than those that emerged in Q 4 and early Q 1. Bunches harvested in Q 1 were fewer and significantly lighter (25 %) than those harvested in Q 3. The weight loss was offset by the fact that farm-gate bunch prices/kg were up to 50 % higher in Q 1 than in Q 3. Preference selection of suckers emerging in late Q 1 will be more profitable, improve food security and reduce farm nutrient exports. Recommendations will need to be tailored to cultivar and altitude. Peer Revie...|$|R
40|$|Two {{concentrations}} {{of each of}} Naphthaleneacetic Acid (NAA) at 10, 000 and 20, 000 ppm, Paclobutrazol (PPm) at 500 and i,ooo ppm and Mefluidide (MP) at 1, 000 and 2, 000 ppm were applied to mature fig cv. Al-madina and pomegranate trees cv. Al-madina. Hand cutting of suckers and control treatments were also included. All treatments were carried out after <b>desuckering.</b> The effective control suckers regrowth was achieved on individual cuts in all treatments. Weight, number and mean length of suckers were reduced for the two fruit tree species under application of all concentrations as compared with hand cut and control treatments. The percentages of reduction in regrowth of suckers number and length were high in 20, 000 ppm NAA and 1, 000 ppm PPm for fig and with 10, 000 and 20, 000 ppm NAA in pomegranate. No {{significant differences were found}} in the mean weight, length and number of suckers between the NAA and aclobutrazol. NAA at 20, 000 ppm increased the mean number of fruits as well as yield per tree in fig, while MF at 2, 000 ppm decreased them as compared with control and hand cut treatments in pomegranate. Although, application of NAA, PPm and MF were less effective on fruit physical properties in the two species, PPm at 500 or 1, 000 ppm increased both TSS % and vitamin C in fig and pomegranate fmits, respectively. NAA increased total sugar percentages in fig fruits and reduced TSS % slightly in pomegranate...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} to examine the economics of plantain production in Iwo and Osogbo zones in the derived savannah zone of Osun State, in Nigeria. The objectives were to identify the characteristics of plantain farms, forecast the trend in farm size and analyze the costs and returns to production of plantains in order to determine its performance and how it can be improved. A multistage sampling technique involving purposive and random sampling was used in the study. Primary data collected {{with the aid of a}} structured questionnaire in 2009 on production inputs and output were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Markov chain process and budgetary technique. Descriptive analysis showed that all farms in the study area grew more than one variety of plantain, a majority (72 %) of the farms adopted the recommended spacing of 3 m 2, all the farms were small scale and more than half of them followed the recommended <b>desuckering</b> policy of 4 - 5 plantain suckers per stool. Markov chain analysis showed an upward trend in the sizes of plantain farms in the area of study until the year 2027 when equilibrium would be attained with mean farm size of about 1960. 5 plantain stands. Budgetary analysis results revealed that plantain production was profitable in the zone. The results further showed that the net return accruing to an average plantain farmer was N 65, 781. 67 per ha per annum.

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Grapevine trunk {{diseases}} {{are responsible for}} reduced wine and table grape production world-wide. Trunk disease infections are caused by xylem-inhabiting pathogens which include species of Botryosphaeriaceae, Diatrypaceae, Hymenochaetales and Diaporthales, as well as Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp. Winter pruning wounds are regarded as the main infection-sites for trunk disease pathogens. However, the role of sucker wounds as portals of trunk disease infections has been minimally investigated. Knowledge of the potential role of grapevine trunk pathogen infections that occur through sucker wounds is important for better wound protection strategies. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the role of grapevine sucker wounds as portals of entry for trunk disease pathogens and to assess the use of Trichoderma spp. for sucker wound protection. The susceptibility of sucker wounds to different trunk disease pathogens was assessed from natural as well as artificial infections. In addition the duration of sucker wound susceptibility in the field was also ascertained. Sucker wounds were sampled from three wine and two table grape vineyards during 2011 and 2012 in the Western Cape province of South Africa. Thereafter, fungal isolations were made from 161 sucker wounds and the cultures were identified based on cultural and morphological characteristics as well as the internal transcribed spacer regions and 5. 8 S ribosomal RNA gene. Sixty-two percent of the wounds were naturally infected by at least one of the trunk pathogens. Phomopsis (Po.) viticola (46 %; 18 %), Diplodia (D.) seriata (30 %; 9 %) and Phaeomoniella (Ph.) chlamydospora (27 %; 5 %) were the most predominant trunk disease pathogens isolated from sucker wounds of field wine and table grape cultivars, respectively. Lower incidences of Phaeoacremonium aleophilum (18 %), Eutypella sp. (3 %), Cryptovalsa ampelina (2 %), Diplodia sp. (1 %) and Neofusicoccum australe (1 %) were obtained, however, only from wine grapes. Sucker wounds on 1 -year-old potted grapevine plants of Chardonnay cultivar were inoculated with spore suspensions of Eutypa lata, N. parvum, Pa. aleophilum, Ph. chlamydospora and Po. viticola in the glasshouse. After 4 months all the inoculated pathogens could be re-isolated at the following incidences: N. parvum (85 %), Ph. chlamydospora (75 %), Po. viticola (65 %), Pa. aleophilum (55 %) and E. lata (45 %). Sucker wound susceptibility was further ascertained under field conditions on 12 -year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines by artificial inoculation of the same pathogen species. After 5 months three pathogens could be re-isolated at the following incidences: Po. viticola (65 %), N. parvum (32. 5 %) and Ph. chlamydospora (7. 5 %). The duration of susceptibility of field sucker wounds to Ph. chlamydospora was assessed for a period of 4 weeks. The wounds remained susceptible for 4 weeks with a decline in susceptibility after one week. This study showed that sucker wounds are susceptible to the major trunk disease pathogens and thus could play an important role in grapevine trunk disease epidemiology. In the second part of this thesis a possible management strategy to prevent infections of sucker wounds was investigated. The use of Trichoderma (T.) harzianum against two trunk pathogens on sucker wounds was tested in the field. Additionally the sensitivity of T. harzianum and T. atroviride was tested in vitro against 16 fungicides that are used to control powdery mildew, downy mildew, Botrytis rot and Phomopsis cane and leaf spot. In October 2012, sucker wounds were made on 1 -year-old wood of Cabernet Sauvignon and spray-treated with Eco- 77 ® immediately after <b>desuckering,</b> and then inoculated with spore suspensions of either Ph. chlamydospora or Po. viticola after 24 hours. After 5 months, isolations were made from the sucker wounds to evaluate the efficacy of the Trichoderma treatment. Trichoderma harzianum reduced the incidence of Ph. chlamydospora by 66. 65 %. Although the incidence of Po. viticola was reduced by 15. 37 %, it was not significantly different from the control treatment. The inhibition of mycelial growth and conidial germination of T. harzianum and T. atroviride were screened against 16 fungicides. The fungicides were applied at 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1 and 2 times the recommended dosages. Systemic fungicides boscalid, metrafenone and trifloxystrobin, as well as contact fungicides quinoxyfen and meptyldinocap were least toxic to Trichoderma spp. isolates. For the conidial germination assay, boscalid, trifloxystrobin, penconazole and metrafenone (systemic) plus quinoxyfen and folpet (contact) were compatible with Trichoderma spp. These fungicides were regarded as being compatible with Trichoderma spp. isolates because they gave mean percentage inhibitions of less than 50 % at all the tested dosages. Spiroxamine and pyrimethanil gave the highest mean percentage inhibitions for both mycelial inhibition and conidial germination. The findings of this study showed that T. harzianum can protect sucker wounds against Ph. chlamydospora in the field. Furthermore, some fungicides applied for the control of powdery mildew and Phomopsis cane and leaf spot can be alternatively or simultaneously applied with T. harzianum and T. atroviride, however, this will have to be verified with field trials. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Wingerd stamsiektes is wêreldwyd verantwoordelik vir verminderde wyn- en tafeldruif produksie. Stamsiektes word veroorsaak deur patogene wat in die xileem voorkom, insluitend verskeie spesies in die Botryosphaeriaceae, Diatrypaceae, Hymenochaetales en Diaporthales, asook Phaeomoniella chlamydospora en Phaeoacremonium spp. Winter snoeiwonde word beskou as die hoof bron van infeksies vir stamsiekte patogene. Die rol van suierwonde as poorte van infeksie vir stamsiektes is nog nie goed bestudeer nie. Kennis van die potensiële rol van wingerd stamsiekte patogeen infeksies wat deur suierwonde plaasvind is belangrik vir die formulasie van beter wondbeskerming strategieë. Die mikpunt van hierdie studie was om die rol van suierwonde as ingangsportale vir wingerd stamsiekte patogene te bepaal en om die gebruik van Trichoderma spp. vir suierwond beskerming te evalueer. Die vatbaarheid van suierwonde vir verskillende stamsiekte patogene is geëvalueer vanuit natuurlike, sowel as kunsmatige infeksies. Die duur van suierwond vatbaarheid in die veld is ook bepaal. Suierwonde is versamel vanuit drie wyn- en twee tafeldruif wingerde gedurende 2011 en 2012 in die Wes Kaap provinsie van Suid Afrika. Hierna is swam isolasies gemaak vanuit 161 suierwonde en die kulture is geïdentifiseer volgens kultuur en morfologiese kenmerke, sowel as die interne transkribeerde spasieerders en 5. 8 S ribosomale RNA geen. Twee-en-sestig persent van die wonde was geïnfekteer deur ten minste een van die stamsiekte patogene. Phomopsis (Po.) viticola (46 %; 18 %), Diplodia (D.) seriata (30 %; 9 %) en Phaeomoniella (Ph.) chlamydospora (27 %; 5 %) was die mees algemene stamsiekte patogene wat, respektiewelik, vanuit die wyn- en tafeldruif kultivars verky is. Laer hoeveelhede Phaeoacremonium aleophilum (18 %), Eutypella sp. (3 %), Cryptovalsa ampelina (2 %), Diplodia sp. (1 %) en Neofusicoccum australe (1 %) is verkry, en slegs vanaf wyndruiwe. Suierwonde op 1 -jaar oue Chardonnay wingerdplante in potte is in die glashuis geïnokuleer met spoorsuspensies van Eutypa lata, N. parvum, Pa. aleophilum, Ph. chlamydospora en Po. viticola. Na 4 maande kon al die geïnokuleerde patogene her-isoleer word teen die volgende hoeveelhede: N. parvum (85 %), Ph. chlamydospora (75 %), Po. viticola (65 %), Pa. aleophilum (55 %) en E. lata (45 %). Suierwond vatbaarheid is verder geëvalueer onder veld kondisies op 12 -jaar oue Cabernet Sauvignon plante deur kunsmatige inokulasie van die selfde patogeen spesies. Na 5 maande kon drie patogene her-isoleer word teen die volgende hoeveelhede: Po. viticola (65 %), N. parvum (32. 5 %) en Ph. chlamydospora (7. 5 %). Die duur van vatbaarheid van suierwonde teen Ph. chlamydospora in die veld is geevalueer oor ‘n periode van 4 weke. Die wonde het vatbaar gebly vir 4 weke met ‘n afname in vatbaarheid na ‘n week. Hierdie studie demonstreer dat suierwonde vatbaar is vir die hoof wingerd stamsiektes en dus ‘n belangrike rol in die epidemiologie van wingerd stamsiektes kan speel. In die tweede deel van hierdie tesis is ‘n moontlike bestuurs-strategie ondersoek om infeksie van suierwonde te verhoed. Die gebruik van Trichoderma (T.) harzianum teen twee stampatogene op suierwonde is getoets in die veld. Verder is die in vitro sensitiwiteit van T. harzianum en T. atroviride getoets teen 16 fungisiedes wat gebruik word in die beheer van poeieragtige meeldou, donsskimmel, Botrytis vrot en Phomopsis streepvlek. Gedurende Oktober 2012 is suierwonde gemaak op 1 -jaar oue hout van Cabernet Sauvignon en onmiddelik behandel met Eco- 77 ® na suiering. Wonde is dan geïnokuleer met spoorsuspensies van óf Ph. chlamydospora óf Po. viticola na 24 uur. Na 5 maande is isolasies gemaak vanaf suierwonde om die doeltreffendheid van van die Trichoderma behandeling te evalueer. Trichoderma harzianum het die voorkoms van Ph. chlamydospora met 66. 65 % verminder. Alhoewel die voorkoms van Po. viticola verminder is met 15. 37 %, was dit nie ‘n beduidende verskil in vergelyking met die kontrole behandeling nie. Die inhibisie van miselium groei en konidia ontkieming van T. harzianum en T. atroviride is getoets teen 16 fungisiedes. Die fungisiedes is aangewend teen 0, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1 en 2 keer die aanbevole dosisse. Sistemiese fungisiedes boscalid, metrafenone en trifloxystrobin, sowel as kontak fungisiedes quinoxyfen en meptyldinocap was die minste toksies teen Trichoderma spp. Gedurende die konidia ontkiemingstoets was boscalid, trifloxystrobin, penconazole en metrafenone (sistemies) en quinoxyfen en folpet (kontak) versoenbaar met Trichoderma spp. Die fungisiedes is beskou as bruikbaar met Trichoderma spp. isolate omdat hulle gemiddelde persentasie inhibisies van minder as 50 % teen al die getoetste dosisse gelewer het. Spiroxamine en pyrimethanil het die hoogste gemiddelde persentasie inhibisie gelewer vir beide die miselium inhibisie en konidia ontkieming. Die bevindings van hierdie studie het gewys dat T. harzianum suierwonde kan beskerm teen Ph. chlamydospora in die veld. Verder sou sommige fungisiedes wat aangewend word vir die bestuur van poeieragtige meeldou en streepvlek moontlik alternatiewelik of gelyktydig met T. harzianum en T. atroviride aangewend word, alhowel dit met veldproewe bevestig moet word...|$|E
