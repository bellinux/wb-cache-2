This {{is a source of}} annoyance to Naomi, whose privacy is invaded when she wakes up one morning, naked, to discover that a male hippy is sleeping in her bed. At college, she avoids Emily to meet with her politics teacher Kieran instead. In the students' common room, they are informed of the upcoming elections for Student President. Emily encourages Naomi to run for president, but Naomi refuses. She later comes across Cook, who tries to persuade her to have sex with him. She jokingly tells him that he <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> chance of winning the student elections, which he sees as a challenge and decides to register. Kieran walks her {{home at the end of}} the day and urges her to run in the elections, giving her a registration form. When she arrives at her house, she finds Emily waiting in her bedroom with another registration form. Emily starts to leave when Naomi is rude and standoffish to herdespite taking Emily's advice to enter the electionsbut returns and confronts her. She coldly tells her that she is not obsessed with pursuing a sexual relationship with her, and Naomi suggests she stay the night with her.|$|E
25|$|Chemotherapy is the {{mainstay}} of treatment for lymphoma in cats. Most of the drugs used in dogs are used in cats, but the most common protocol uses cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone.

Remission and survival times are comparable to dogs. Lower stage lymphoma <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> prognosis.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to investigate the difference of learning achievement in Mathematics on the learning of Cubes and Cuboids in each learning model viewed from the spatial abilities and the cognitive styles. This research used the quasi experimental research with the factorial design of 3 x 3 x 2. The proposed hypotheses of the research were analyzed by using the three-way analysis of variance with unbalanced cells. The results of the research are as follows. 1) The students instructed with the NHT learning model with guided discovery method <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those instructed with the NHT learning model and those with the direct learning model, and the students instructed with the NHT learning model <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the direct learning model. 2) The students with the high, moderate, and low spatial abilities have the same good learning achievement in Mathematics. 3) The students with the cognitive style of field independent <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the cognitive style of field dependent. 4). In each category of the spatial abilities, the students instructed with the NHT learning model with guided discovery method <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those instructed with the NHT learning model and those with the direct learning model, and the students instructed with the NHT learning model <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the direct learning model. 5) In each category of the spatial abilities, the students instructed with the NHT learning model with guided discovery method <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those instructed with the NHT learning model and those with the direct learning model, and the students instructed with the NHT learning model <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> learning achievement in Mathematics than those with the direct learning model...|$|R
