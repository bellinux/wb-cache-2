5|$|Since {{at least}} some of Tyrannosauruss {{potential}} prey could move quickly, evidence that it walked instead of ran could indicate that it was a scavenger. On the other hand, recent analyses suggest that Tyrannosaurus, while slower than large modern terrestrial predators, may well have been <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> prey on large hadrosaurs and ceratopsians.|$|E
5|$|The 4 × 100 meter men's relay team—made up of Antoine Adams, Delwayne Delaney, Brijesh Lawrence, Jason Rogers, and Lestrod Roland—set a {{national}} record during the event {{with a time}} of 38.41 seconds. Although they set {{a national}} record, they placed sixth, which was not <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> advance them to the next round.|$|E

5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2007). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because {{they are unlikely to}} be declining <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> qualify for listing in a more threatened category. When last assessed in 2007, the population trend was stable.|$|E
5|$|If a {{white dwarf}} is in a binary star system and is accreting matter from its companion, {{a variety of}} {{phenomena}} may occur, including novae and Type Ia supernovae. It {{may also be a}} super-soft x-ray source if it is able to take material from its companion <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> sustain fusion on its surface. A close binary system of two white dwarfs can radiate energy in the form of gravitational waves, causing their mutual orbit to steadily shrink until the stars merge.|$|E

He finished the first heat of the 100 m sprint in third place with a time of 10.27, which was <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> qualify him for the quarterfinals. Collins ran a little slower in the second heat—finishing with a time of 10.34—which was not sufficient to qualify for the semifinals.|$|E

5|$|The {{waters in}} which Kimberella dwelt were {{occasionally}} disturbed by sandy currents, caused when sediments were whipped up by storms or meltwater discharge, and washed over the creatures. In {{response to this}} stress, the organisms appear to have retracted their soft parts into their shells; apparently they could not move <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> outrun the currents. Some organisms survived the current, and attempted to burrow {{out of the sand}} that had been deposited above them; some unsuccessful attempts can be seen where juveniles were fossilised {{at the end of a}} burrow a few centimetres long.|$|E

5|$|After {{finishing}} his American university career, Tonelli returned to Australia and gained selection {{for his second}} Olympics. Having cleared the political obstacles, Tonelli was given a heavy schedule of six events: both backstroke races, the 100m freestyle and butterfly, and two relays. He made little impact in the individual events, only reaching one final. Australia lacked butterfly swimmers and Tonelli was versatile, so he swum the stroke in the medley relay. He performed above his previous record, posting a time <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> win silver in the corresponding individual event and helping Australia to an unexpected win. Upon returning to Australia, Tonelli retired with eleven individual Australian championships in three different strokes.|$|E
5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is twice as long as a typical clipper ship.|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> catch them. These include falcons {{such as the}} American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E

5|$|During her career, Haruna {{underwent}} {{two major}} reconstructions. Beginning in 1926, the Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt {{her as a}} battleship, strengthening her armor and improving her speed and power capabilities. In 1933, her superstructure was completely rebuilt, her speed was increased, and she was equipped with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> accompany Japan's growing carrier fleet, Haruna was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Haruna transported Imperial Japanese Army troops to mainland China before being redeployed to the Third Battleship Division in 1941.

5|$|Hill was {{qualifying}} for a 1997 event at Sonoma when his car suffered severe vibration {{as he crossed}} the finish line. The car went out of control and was completely destroyed. Hill had two broken toes and a shoulder contusion, which were not serious injuries. The run had been <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> make Hill the fastest qualifier, and Hill wanted to race his backup car in the first round on the day after the accident. The NHRA had a rule that the car used for qualifying had {{to be used in the}} event, so the sanctioning body did not allow him to compete. The rule was changed after the event to allow racers to race on race day even if they do not use the same car.|$|E
5|$|Kongō {{underwent}} {{two major}} reconstructions. Beginning in 1929, the Imperial Japanese Navy rebuilt {{her as a}} battleship, strengthening her armor and improving her speed and power capabilities.

Now <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> accompany Japan's growing carrier fleet, Kongō was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Kongō operated {{off the coast of}} mainland China before being redeployed to the Third Battleship Division in 1941.

5000|$|The Italian three-toed skink {{is common}} in {{suitable}} habitats over much of its wide range. It is threatened by urbanization and the degradation of its habitat by coastal development, but it is tolerant of some degree of habitat modification.

50|$|The British had {{recently}} announced that they would begin deporting illegal immigrants to Cyprus rather than Atlit, whereupon Aliyah Bet organizers decided immigrants should begin resisting capture. The President Warfield was well-suited for that, because it was <b>fast,</b> sturdy <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> not easily overturn, made of steel which would help it withstand ramming, and was taller than the British destroyers which would be trying to board it.|$|R
5000|$|Mainstream economists {{believe that}} {{economic}} recessions can be largely mitigated {{by increasing the}} money supply during economic downturns. A gold standard means that the money supply would {{be determined by the}} gold supply and hence monetary policy could no longer be used to stabilize the economy. The gold standard is often blamed for prolonging the Great Depression, as under the gold standard, central banks could not expand credit at a <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> rate <b>to</b> offset deflationary forces.|$|R
5|$|Regardless of the {{preference}} toward airships, several small merchant vessels were converted into seaplane carriers during World War I. They carried only {{two to four}} aircraft each, however, and were too slow to operate with the High Seas Fleet. The light cruiser , which was <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> steam with the Fleet, was converted into a seaplane carrier in 1918. She too, though, only carried two seaplanes. It was decided to convert the liner Ausonia into a flight-deck carrier for wheeled aircraft as well as floatplanes. The plan for the conversion was drawn up by Leutnant zur See Jürgen Reimpell in 1918, {{an officer of the}} 1st Aviation Detachment.|$|E
5|$|Soviet {{citizens}} {{had only}} three days from 23 - 25 January to exchange their old 50 rouble and 100 rouble banknotes for the new currency. Exchange could be postponed, but only through specialized government commissions. Due to this short exchange window, long queues formed in front of Soviet savings banks, {{even though it was}} also possible to exchange money at workplaces and post offices. This reform also dealt a crippling blow to Soviet citizens who had saved their money and could not move <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> get it exchanged; some lost as much as 15,000 - 30,000 rubles overnight.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1927, Kirishimas first {{reconstruction}} rebuilt {{her as a}} battleship, strengthening her {{armor and}} improving her speed. From 1934, a second reconstruction completely rebuilt her superstructure, upgraded her engine plant, and equipped her with launch catapults for floatplanes. Now <b>fast</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> accompany Japan's growing carrier fleet, she was reclassified as a fast battleship. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Kirishima acted primarily as a support vessel and troop transport, moving army troops to mainland China.
