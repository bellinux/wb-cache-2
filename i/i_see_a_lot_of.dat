Kurt Cobain wrote, [...] "Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld/So I can sigh eternally." [...] Cohen, after Cobain's suicide, {{was quoted as saying}} [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't have spoken to the young man. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people at the Zen Centre, who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} are {{the more}} recent comments from Vice Adm. Harry B. Harris Jr., deputy chief of naval operations for communication networks (OPNAV N-6) and deputy chief information officer, Department of the Navy. [...] "I believe that NMCI in 2008 is achieving {{much of what we}} had hoped NMCI would achieve. It's leveled the playing field for security. It's allowed us to do things like push security patches that go through the whole enterprise that's on NMCI. If you look at NMCI historically, it was probably the first step for the Navy to move into what was then called Joint Vision 2010 and now is Joint Vision 2020. It's actually done that, and it's moving the Navy toward the U.S. Defense Department's goal of information superiority. So, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> good things with NMCI." ...|$|E

6000|$|Harold March {{frowned at}} the tablecloth; then, after an interval, he said: [...] "I think I {{understand}} your notion of how the thing was actually done; according to that, Morris just made a hole and fished {{it up with a}} magnet {{at the end of a}} string. Such a monkey trick looks like mere madness, but I suppose he was mad, partly with the boredom of watching over what he felt was a fraud, though he couldn't prove it. Then came a chance to prove it, to himself at least, and he had what he called 'fun' with it. Yes, I think <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> details now. But it's just the whole thing that knocks me. How did it all come to be like that?" ...|$|E

50|$|In August 2010, at a {{function}} {{to celebrate the}} 40th anniversary of Carlton's memorable 1970 premiership, Nicholls {{took the opportunity to}} voice his displeasure at the way Carlton had been run by previous administrators since the 1995 premiership, which eventually led, among other things, to the club's first wooden spoon in 2002:The thing that annoys me more at the moment about Carlton is our lack of respect, generally, in the footballing public. I know that, without going right through all the 50-odd years, <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of good committees come and go. <b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of good players come and go, but {{there is a lack of}} respect and, to me, a trashing of the Carlton brand in the past 10 or 15 years.|$|R
3000|$|I {{feel that}} they have better food quality control here, and <b>I</b> don’t <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of {{negative}} reports in the media on food safety.

40|$|<b>I</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of growth}} in our {{students}} and more children reading on a regular basis. All students in grades K- 3 participate in independent reading because their teachers incorporate that into their daily schedule.

5000|$|In 2004 Leonard Cohen told The Guardian, [...] "I'm sorry I couldn't {{have spoken}} to the young man. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> people at the Zen Centre, who have gone through drugs and found a way out that is not just Sunday school.

6000|$|... "No, I don't hint," [...] replied Withers, impatiently. [...] "I know. It's not {{the first}} time I've known a missionary to do this sort of thing. Nor is it the first time for Willetts. Bishop Kane, I live among the Indians. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>I</b> never speak of. My work is to trade with the Indians, that's all. But I'll not have Willetts or any other damned hypocrite run down my friend here. John Shefford is the finest young man that ever came to me in the desert. And he's got to be put right before you all or I'll not set foot in Stonebridge again.... Willetts was after Glen Naspa. Shefford punched him. And later threw him out of the old Indian's hogan up on the mountain. That {{explains}} Willetts's enmity. He was after the girl." ...|$|R

5000|$|More recently, in 2009, Johnson stated I don't {{think there}} is an anti-jihadist {{movement}} anymore. ... It's all a bunch of kooks.

50|$|Someone {{has said}} that enemies are just people whose stories we don’t know. <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> truth in that. The more other people’s stories are hidden from us, {{the easier it is}} for us to view them as enemies.

50|$|In 1973 she {{published}} {{her fourth}} collection, رحيل المرافئ القديمة “The Departure of Old Ports”, {{considered by some}} critiques {{one of the most}} important of her works. In this collection of short stories she described in a literary fashion the dilemma of the Arab intellectual of the time and the conflict between his/her thought and actions. She published her first novel, بيروت 75 “Beirut 75” around the end of 1974. The novel describes the complex social problems in Beirut and started with a prophecy by one of the characters of the novel, a fortune teller that says: “I see blood, <b>I</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> blood”.

5000|$|I've heard <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> about {{education}} {{and the need to}} hold teachers and schools accountable, and I certainly agree with that.
