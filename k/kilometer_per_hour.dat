The bypass section is a controlled-access highway and is often called the Ring Road. Traffic continuing east along the Trans–Canada Highway exits at Victoria Avenue. After Regina, Highway 1 continues onward to Brandon and Winnipeg.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} example concerns {{definitions of}} quantities and units. The (average) velocity (v) {{of an object}} {{is defined as the}} quantitative physical property of the object that is directly proportional to the distance (d) traveled by the object and inversely proportional to the time (t) of travel, i.e., v = kd/t, where k is a constant that depends on the units used. Suppose that the meter (m) and the second (s) are base units; then the kilometer (km) and the hour (h) are noncoherent derived units. The meter per second (mps) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one meter in one second, and the <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> (kmph) is defined as the velocity of an object that travels one kilometer in one hour. Substituting from the definitions of the units into the defining equation of velocity we obtain, 1 mps = k m/s and 1 kmph = k km/h = 1/3.6 k m/s = 1/3.6 mps. Now choose k = 1; then the meter per second is a coherent derived unit, and the <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> is a noncoherent derived unit. Suppose that we choose to use the <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> as the unit of velocity in the system. Then the system becomes noncoherent, and the numerical value equation for velocity becomes {v} = 3.6 {d}/{t}. Coherence may be restored, without changing the units, by choosing k = 3.6; then the <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour</b> is a coherent derived unit, with 1 kmph = 1 m/s, and the meter per second is a noncoherent derived unit, with 1 mps = 3.6 m/s.|$|E

2500|$|The slash is {{the usual}} way to abbreviate derived units {{incorporating}} division, such as km/h (<b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> and [...] m/s² (meters per second per second), although there are exceptions, such as mph (miles <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> and kph (an alternative format for <b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour).</b>|$|R
50|$|Traffic {{congestion}} reduces average traffic speed. At low speeds, {{scientific studies}} reveal, vehicles burn fuel inefficiently and pollute more per trip. For example, {{a study in}} the United States found that for the same trip, cars consumed more fuel and polluted more if the traffic was congested, than when traffic flowed freely. At average trip speeds between 20 and 40 <b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> the cars pollutant emission was twice as much as when the average speed was 55 to 75 <b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> At average trip speeds between 5 and 20 <b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> the cars pollutant emissions were 4 to 8 times as much as when the average speed was 55 to 70 <b>kilometers</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> Fuel efficiencies similarly were much worse with traffic congestion.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this research, it is {{analytically}} the interrelations between the traffic flow characteristics that include traffic density, rate of flow, and speed (k, q, and u) into completely congestion traffic conditions. This study investigates the macroscopic models of traffic flow characteristics on a new weaving section on the Taiwan National Freeway Systems, focusing on the interrelations between the traffic speed, density, and rate of flow of the congestion traffic conditions. The analysis based on these driver behaviors includes 100 % lane-changing and 65. 22 % weaving activities. The results for this study show the fundamental interrelation of traffic flow characteristics on the completely congestion traffic flow condition similar to Greenshield model and showing no influence on lane changing and weaving activities. These regression models concludes that the critical density is 55. 74 vehicles per kilometer, the speed is 34. 29 <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour,</b> and the maximum rate of flow (capacity) is 1854 vehicles per hour per lane, respectively.

It has two lines on the physical link of 661. 1 kilometers with commercial speed of 300 <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour.</b> This paper documents operators ’ service changes and customer’s reaction to the introduction of KTX during the first year. KTX reduced rail travel time between major cities reduced almost by half with 128 daily services [...] It achieved one million and 10 million passengers by the 14 and 142 days of operation, respectively. Rail demand for Seoul-Busan corridor increased 30 % and 10 % for Seoul-Mokpo corridor compared to the same period 2003 with KTX service. Long-distance travel customers, especially from air travel and existing rail passengers from Saemaeul service are major sources of KTX demand. Passengers ’ expected service level and initial marketing strategies are found very important with KTX introduction. KTX strengthened the viability of rail travel as a whole and is expected to contribute to building more balanced national transportation system...|$|E
40|$|Lane {{changes are}} an {{important}} aspect of freeway flow. Most lane change models are microscopic, describing whether individual vehicles/drives will change lanes, and hence are calibrated microscopically. Macroscopic validation often is restricted to the distribution of vehicles across lanes. To the best of our knowledge, no systematic analysis has been made of the number of lane changes as function of the operational characteristics of the origin and target lane. This paper fills that gap, by analyzing the number of lane changes as function of several incentives. Based on data availability, two “simple” sites are selected, i. e. {{as close as possible to}} a straight continuous freeway. Statistically, we find that on the selected sites, drivers change lanes on average once per two kilometer driven. Furthermore, analyzing the number of lane changes (per <b>kilometer</b> <b>per</b> <b>hour)</b> as function of the density in the origin lane and in the target lane, we find, as expected, this increases with the density in the origin lane for a fixed density in the target lane. Surprisingly, it also increases with the density in the target lane for a fixed density in the origin lane. The underlying mechanism is therefore different than gap acceptance theory. The analyses presented in this paper can be used to qualitatively verify (microscopic and macroscopic) lane change models, and to propose better lane change models.
