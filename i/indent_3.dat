40|$|The use of through-the-eyelid {{tonometry}} {{to determine}} the intraocular pressure (IOP) of the eye for glaucoma screening may improve patient comfort by deforming the cornea through a closed eyelid rather than directly. Two techniques to determine IOP are proposed and evaluated. The first method requires a determination of the beginning point of corneal applanation from a force-indentation curve of the eyelid and cornea in series. Eyelid and cornea frequency dependence data as well as force-indentation curves were obtained on one subject in a supine position. Measurements indicate differing stiffness ranges for the eyelid and cornea, however, the force-indentation curves only slightly suggest these differences. The second tonometry method requires a 3 d plot of eyelid/cornea ultrasound scans versus increasing applied force to recognize decreasing corneal echo width as the eyelid and cornea are flattened. 3 d plots were obtained from <b>indenting</b> <b>3</b> pliant hemispheres with an ultrasound probe.

40|$|Indentation {{is used as}} a {{technique}} for mechanical characterization of materials for a long time. In the last few decades, new techniques of mechanical characterization at micro and nano level using indentation have been developed. Mechanical character-ization of thin films has become an important area of research because of their crucial role in modern technological applications. Theoretical and computational models of indentation are less time consuming,cost effective, and flexible. Many researchers have investigated mechanical properties of thin films using theoretical and computational models. In this study, an indentation model for a thin layer-substrate geometry with the possibility of nonhomogeneous or homogeneous interface of finite thickness between layer and substrate has been developed. The layer and substrate can be nonhomogeneous or homogeneous. Three types of indenters are modeled: 1) Uniform pressure indenter 2) Flat <b>indenter</b> <b>3)</b> Smooth <b>indenter.</b> Contact depth, maximum interfacial normal stress and maximum interfacial shear stress {{play an important role in}} design and mechanical characterization of thin films using indentation and the effect of modeling the interface as homogeneous and nonhomogeneous on these parameters is studied.

40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} framework design on the fatigue life and failure modes of metal ceramic (MC, Ni-Cr alloy core, VMK 95 porcelain veneer), glass-infiltrated alumina (ICA, In-Ceram Alumina/VM 7), and veneered yttria-stabilized tetragonal zirconia polycrystals (Y-TZP, IPSe. max ZirCAD/IPS e. max,) crowns. Methods: Sixty composite resin tooth replicas of a prepared maxillary first molar were produced to receive crowns systems of a standard (MCs, ICAs, and Y-TZPs, n = 10 each) or a modified framework design (MCm, ICAm, and Y-TZPm, n = 10 each). Fatigue loading was delivered with a spherical steel <b>indenter</b> (<b>3.</b> 18 mm radius) {{on the center of}} the occlusal surface using r-ratio fatigue (30 - 300 N) until completion of 10 (6) cycles or failure. Fatigue was interrupted every 125, 000 cycles for damage evaluation. Weibull distribution fits and contour plots were used for examining differences between groups. Failure mode was evaluated by light polarized and SEM microscopy. Results: Weibull analysis showed the highest fatigue life for MC crowns regardless of framework design. No significant difference (confidence bound overlaps) was observed between ICA and Y-TZP with or without framework design modification. Y-TZPm crowns presented fatigue life in the range of MC crowns. No porcelain veneer fracture was observed in the MC groups, whereas ICAs presented bulk fracture and ICAm failed mainly through the veneer. Y-TZP crowns failed through chipping within the veneer, without core fractures. Conclusions: Framework design modification did not improve the fatigue life of the crown systems investigated. Y-TZPm crowns showed comparable fatigue life to MC groups. Failure mode varied according to crown system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The {{invasive}} {{behavior of}} hepatocytes from diethylnitrosamine (DENA) induced neoplastic nodules and hepatocarcinomas was studied in a confronting culture system in vitro. These observations confirm our previous report, demonstrating that hepatocytes from hepatocarcinomas and from neoplastic nodules invaded into embryonic chick precultured heart fragments (PHF), a property associated with malignancy (Mareel, 1979). We now further demonstrate that: (1) Invasiveness was {{expressed by the}} hepatocytes in 10 out of 12 samples from hepatocarcinomas, and in 13 out of 36 confronted nodular samples. The hepatocytes from the other two‐thirds of nodule samples died off in the confrontation as did all normal hepatocytes. (2) Invasive hepatocytes from tumors and from nodules showed the same arrangement of invasive liver cells {{in relation to the}} heart tissue, and the same ultrastructural phenotypes. The latter did not differ from those in the non‐invading subpopulations, with the exception perhaps of a higher proportion of cells with an <b>indented</b> nucleus. (<b>3)</b> None of the scored ultrastructural alterations was present in all the invasive cells, thus excluding any specific requisite in this respect. (4) When 3 H‐TdR was made continuously available to the cultures, starting at the time of confrontation between heart and liver tissues, unlabelled as well as labelled invasive hepatocytes were found inside the PHF in about equal proportions. It is concluded that nodular hepatocytes deviate from normality by at least 2 different properties {{that may or may not}} be related to each other and are revealed under in vitro conditions, namely the ability to survive and to proceed through S‐phase and mitosis under such conditions and to actively invade precultured chick heart fragments. The latter property indicates that at least some of the nodules contain hepatocytes that have performed one step in malignant progression. Copyright © 1987 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

40|$|The {{interface}} {{region in}} polymer/glass composite materials was investigated {{by means of}} the nano-indentation and the nano-scratch techniques. The nano-indentation test involved indentations as small as 30 nm in depth in order to detect the material properties in the transition region between the fibre and the matrix. A line of nano indents was produced along the 14 mu m path starting from the matrix and ending on the fibre. The distinct properties of the transition zone were revealed by 2 - <b>3</b> <b>indents.</b> The nano-scratch test involves moving a sample while being in contact with a diamond tip. The coefficient of friction, defined as the ratio of the tangential force from the tip-sample contact to the normal force, also indicated a transition zone of different width. Analysis of the results allowed elimination of effects due to: (i) indenter width and its geometry; (ii) stress field and plastic zone interactions, to arrive at true interphase width as a material characteristic. These two techniques proved to be useful tools in the investigation of the size and the character of the interphase region in the fibrous polymer/glass composite materials.

The yield stress and strain hardening exponent of the two layers were identified based on a power law type equation to define the stress-strain relationship. A 2 D axis-symmetric <b>indenter</b> having 70. <b>3</b> ° half angle was used, which is representative of a Berkovich or a Vickers indenter. The use of finite element analyses was substituted with a fast and equally accurate approach for the iterative optimization procedure. Thus, the computation time was considerably reduced. The robustness is tested using pseudo-experimental results, in terms of indentation curve and imprint on the material, with added random noises of 2. 5 %, 5. 0 %, 7. 5 % and 10. 0 %. The proposed approach provides a good estimate of the sought material properties.

The morphology of individual microorganisms was examined at the margins and apex of those species which lacked a surface coat (C. pseudotropicalis, C. krusei, C. parakrusei, C. guilliermondii), and through cracks in the surface coating of those which showed a surface coat (C. albicans, C. tropicalis).

40|$|Various {{models have}} been {{proposed}} to explain tectonic deformations during continent collision. A frequently applied model is the thin viscous sheet model which is however not fully 3 -D and assumes a priori diffuse thickening as the dominant deformation style. We compare a fully 3 -D multilayer numerical model with a corresponding thin viscous sheet numerical model for the scenario of continent indentation. In our comparison {{we focus on the}} three basic viscous deformation styles thickening, buckling (folding) and lateral crustal flow. Both numerical models are based on the finite element method (FEM) and employ either a linear or power-law viscous rheology. The 3 -D model consists of four layers representing a simplified continental lithosphere: strong upper crust, weak lower crust, strong upper mantle and weak lower mantle. The effective viscosity depth-profile in the 3 -D model is used to calculate the depth-averaged effective viscosity used in the thin-sheet model allowing a direct comparison of both models. We quantify the differences in the strain rate and velocity fields, and investigate the evolution of crustal thickening, buckling and crustal flow resulting from the two models for two different phases of deformation: (1) indentation with a constant velocity and (2) gravitational collapse after a decrease of the indenting velocity by a factor of 5. The results indicate that thin-sheet models approximate well the overall large-scale lithospheric deformation, especially during indentation and for a linear viscous rheology. However, in the 3 -D model, additional processes such as multilayer buckling and lower crustal flow emerge, which are ignored in the thin-sheet model but dominate the deformation style in the 3 -D model within a range of a few hundreds of kilometres around the collision zone and indenter corner. Differences between the 3 -D and thin-sheet model are considerably larger for a power-law viscous than for a linear viscous rheology. Buckling and lower crustal flow are significant in the 3 -D model with power-law viscous rheology. For example, fibre strain rates due to buckling can be several hundred per cent different to the depth-averaged strain rate and the lateral mass flow of lower crustal material can be up to six times more than the flow of upper crustal material. Our results also show that the horizontal velocity fields of the upper crust and upper mantle remain nearly identical in the 3 -D model during indentation despite their mechanical decoupling due to an intermediate weak lower crust. This result questions the validity of using similarities between velocities from the surface global positioning system (GPS) and mantle shear wave splitting data as evidence for a mechanically coupled lithosphere. 3 -D multilayer models provide a more complete picture of continental collision than thin-sheet models as they enable studying the timing, locality and relative importance of different processes simultaneously which is especially important for the hundreds of kilometre scale around the collision zone and <b>indenter</b> corners. <b>3</b> -D models are, however, still computationally challenging and we, therefore, also present results of a computational performance test of several solution algorithm...|$|R

40|$|Three novel {{experimental}} {{techniques were}} employed in this work in order to investigate {{the influence of the}} interphase region in polymer-glass composites on the bulk material properties: (i) the microdroplet test is a single fibre test designed to characterize the fibre-matrix bond (interface region) and to determine the interfacial shear stress in composite material; (ii) the nano-indentation test, a novel nano-hardness technique with ability to produce an indent as low as a few nanometres was employed in order to measure nano-hardness of the fibre-matrix interphase region; and (iii) the nano-scratch test, used in conjunction with the nano-indentation test for measurement of the interphase region width. The microdroplet test (MDT) has been used to characterize the interfacial bond in fibrous composite materials. The specimen consists of a fibre with a drop of cured resin pulled while the drop is being supported by a platinum disc with a hole. A properly tested specimen fails at the droplet's tip-fibre interface, revealing the ultimate interfacial shear strength. In this study, finite element analysis (FEA) of the MDT has been focused toward simulation of the fibre-matrix interphase region. The influence of several functional variations of the material properties across the interphase layer on the stress distribution at the droplet's tip was analysed. The results showed that the variation of the interphase properties significantly affects the stress distribution at the fibre-droplet interface, and, therefore, the stress redistribution to composite material. These results led to further experimental investigation of the interphase region, in order to obtain the material properties essential for the interfacial stress analysis. The interphase region in dry and water aged polymer-glass composite materials was investigated by means of the nano-indentation and the nano-scratch techniques. The nano-indentation test involved indentation as small as 30 nm in depth, produced along a 14 mum path between the fibre and the matrix. The distinct properties of the interphase region were revealed by 2 - <b>3</b> <b>indents</b> in dry materials and up to 15 indents in water aged, degraded materials. These results indicated interdiffusion in water aged interphase regions. The nano-scratch test involves moving a sample while being in contact with a diamond tip. The nano-scratch test, used in conjunction with the nano-indentation test, accurately measured the width of the interphase region. The results showed that the harder interphase region dissolved into the softer interphase region (both regions being harder/stronger than the matrix) expanding its width after aging in water.

40|$|Indentation hardness, H, {{has been}} widely used to {{characterize}} the mechanical properties of materials {{for more than a}} century because of the following advantages of this technique; (1) it requires small sample and (2) the test is non destructive in nature. Recent technological advances helped in the development of instrumented indentation machines which can record the load, P, vs. displacement, h, data continuously during indentation with excellent load and displacement resolutions. From these, H and the elastic modulus, E, of the indented material can be obtained on the basis of the ‘contact area’ of the indentation at the maximum load. The estimation of true contact area becomes difficult during ‘pile-up’ and ‘sink-in’, commonly observed phenomena while indentation of a low and high strain hardened materials. In order for the better understanding of these phenomena it is important to understand the plastic flow distribution under indenters. It is also important for the prediction of elastic-plastic properties from the P-h data. Recently, there have been considerable theoretical and simulation efforts on this front with a combination of dimensional analysis and finite element simulations. One of the important input parameter for the dimensional analysis is the ‘representative strain’ under the indenter, which is a strong function of the indenter geometry. However there is no comprehensive understanding of the representative strain under the indenter despite several studies till date. One objective of the present thesis is to conduct an experimental analysis of the plastic flow during the sharp indentation. The plastic zone size and shape under conical indenters of different apex angles in a pure and annealed copper were examined by employing the subsurface indentation technique to generate the hardness map. From these isostrain contours are constructed joining the data having similar strain values. The following are the key observations. (1) The plastic strain contours are elliptical in nature, spreading more along the direction of the indenter axis than the lateral direction. (2) The magnitude of the plastic strain in the contact region decreases with increasing the <b>indenter</b> angle. (<b>3)</b> The strain decay in the indentation direction follow a power-law relation with the distance. The estimated representative strains under the indenters, computed as the volume average strain within the elastic-plastic boundary, decreases with increasing indenter angle. We also performed finite element simulations to generate plastic flow distribution under the indenter geometries and compared with the experimental results. The results suggest that the experimental and computed average strains match well. However, the plastic strain contours do not, suggesting that further detailed understanding of the elasto-plastic deformation underneath the sharp indenter is essential before reliable estimates of plastic properties from the P-h curves can be made routinely. The second objective of this thesis is to understand plastic flow in amorphous alloys. It is now well established that plastic deformation in metallic glasses is pressure sensitive, owing to the fundamentally different mechanisms vis-à-vis the dislocation mediated plastic flow in crystalline metals alloys. Early work has shown that the pressure sensitivity of amorphous alloys gets reflected as high constraint factor, C (hardness to yield stress ratio), which sometimes exceed 3. 0. In this thesis, we study the temperature dependence of pressure sensitive plastic flow in bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) using C as the proxy for the pressure sensitivity. Experiments on three different BMGs show that C increases with temperature hence the pressure sensitivity. In addition we have carried out finite element simulations to generate P-h curves for different levels of pressure sensitivities and match them with the experimental curves that are obtained at different temperatures. Simulations predict that higher pressure sensitivity index values are required to match the experimental curves at high temperatures confirming that the pressure sensitivity increases with increasing temperature. The fundamental mechanisms responsible for the increase in pressure sensitivity are discussed in detail. Finally we pose a question, is the increase in pressure sensitivity with temperature is common to other amorphous materials such as strong amorphous polymers? In order to answer this question we have chosen PMMA, a strong amorphous polymer. In this study also we have taken C as a proxy to index the pressure sensitivity. Indentation stress-strain curves are constructed at different temperature using spherical indentation experiments. The C values corresponding to different temperatures are determined and plotted as a function of temperature. It is found that C increases with temperature implying that the pressure sensitivity of amorphous polymers also increases with temperature. The micro-mechanisms responsible for the increase in pressure sensitivity are sought...|$|R
