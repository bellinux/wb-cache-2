5|$|A {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. The rationale for {{the building of the}} station was that Frogner was to be developed as a dense, commercial district. However, to cut costs with the Oslo Tunnel, it was decided that parts of Nationaltheatret would not be built yet, and that Elisenberg Station would not open until after the tunnel was completed. By 1978, the platform area had been built, but the access way <b>had</b> <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> investments cost 30 million Norwegian krone (NOK), 75 mill. of 1998 standard. The Oslo Tunnel opened, without Elisenberg Station, on 1 June 1980.|$|E
5|$|Mercator {{now turned}} to the modern maps, as author but no longer engraver: the practicalities of {{production}} of maps and globes had been passed to his sons and grandsons. In 1585 he issued a collection of 51 maps covering France, the Low Countries and Germany. Other maps may have followed in good order <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> misfortunes of life intervened: his wife Barbara died in 1586 and his eldest son Arnold died the following year so that only Rumold and the sons of Arnold were left to carry forward his business. In addition, {{the time he had}} available for cartography was reduced by a burst of writing on philosophy and theology: a substantial written work on the Harmonisation of the Gospels as well as commentaries on the epistle of St. Paul and the book of Ezekiel.|$|E
5|$|The WNO chorus and {{orchestra}} {{have been engaged}} for studio opera recordings unconnected with the company's productions, including Hamlet (1983), Norma (1984), Anna Bolena (1987), Ernani (1987) and Adriana Lecouvreur (1988) conducted by Richard Bonynge, Faust (1993) and Katya Kabanova (1994) conducted by Rizzi; and Gloriana (1993), Eugene Onegin (1994) and Jenůfa (2004) conducted by Mackerras. For the WNO jubilee in 1996, Decca drew on some of its studio recordings for a celebratory CD set with contributions from many soloists who had appeared onstage with the company and some who <b>had</b> <b>not,</b> <b>the</b> latter including Joan Sutherland, Luciano Pavarotti, Montserrat Caballe and Thomas Hampson. The orchestra of WNO has made studio recordings of non-operatic music by Elgar, Delius, Coleridge-Taylor and George Lloyd, and several sets of traditional Welsh songs and crossover music.|$|E

5|$|The outcome has two versions. In {{the first}} version, Nikola Jurišić {{rejected}} the offer to surrender on favourable terms, and the Ottomans retreated. In the second version, {{the city was}} offered terms for a nominal surrender. The only Ottomans who {{would be allowed to}} enter the castle would be a token force who would raise the Ottoman flag. In either case, Suleiman withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and returned homeward instead of continuing towards Vienna as previously planned. He had been delayed nearly four weeks, and during this time a powerful army had been collected in Vienna, which Suleiman <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> intention to face. According to historian Paolo Giovio, Charles arrived with an imperial army at Vienna on 23 September, too late for fighting the Ottomans since Suleiman already withdrew. By their defense of Kőszeg, Nikola Jurišić and his men had saved Vienna from a siege.|$|E

The THHK grew quickly and expanded into different fields, and Lie helped organise a debating club, sports club, and charity fairs and concerts. From 1903 to 1904 Lie was a managing member of the board, serving mainly as its treasurer.|$|E

25|$|Mainstream {{academics}} {{reject the}} anti-Stratfordian claim that Shakespeare <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> education {{to write the}} plays. Shakespeare {{grew up in a}} family of some importance in Stratford; his father John Shakespeare, one of the wealthiest men in Stratford, was an Alderman and later High Bailiff of the corporation. It would be surprising had he not attended the local grammar school, as such institutions were founded to educate boys of Shakespeare's moderately well-to-do standing.|$|E
25|$|Spofforth, {{having taken}} seven for 44 in this innings (making it {{fourteen}} for ninety in the match), bowled his last eleven overs for two runs and four wickets, those two runs and four wickets coming off his last seven deliveries.

6000|$|His blank verse is best {{described}} by negatives. It <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> endless variety, the elasticity {{and freedom of}} Shakespeare's, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> massiveness and majesty of Milton's, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> austere grandeur of Wordsworth's at its best, it <b>has</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> wavy swell, [...] "the linked sweetness long drawn out" [...] of Shelley's, but its distinguishing feature is, if we may use the expression, its importunate beauty. What Coleridge said of Claudian's style may be applied to it: [...] "Every line, nay every word stops, looks full in your face and asks and begs for praise". His earlier blank verse is less elaborate and seemingly more spontaneous and easy than his later. [2] But it is in his lyric verse that his rhythm is seen in its greatest perfection. No English lyrics have more magic or more haunting beauty, more of that which charms at once and charms for ever.|$|R

25|$|When {{the deteriorating}} Third Dynasty of Ur (Ur III) finally {{collapsed}} {{at the hands}} of the Elamites at the end of the third millennium BC, a power vacuum was left that other city-states scrambled to fill. The last king of the Ur Dynasty, Ibbi-Sin, <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> resources nor the organized government needed to expel the Elamite invaders. One of his governmental officials, Ishbi-Erra, relocated from Ur to Isin, another city in the south of Mesopotamia, and established himself as a ruler there. One of Ishbi-Erra's year names reports his defeating Ibbi-Sin in battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{railways}} in Great Britain {{had come}} under government control from {{the outbreak of}} war but those in Ireland <b>had</b> <b>not.</b> <b>The</b> trades unions believed that under control their members would achieve parity in wartime bonuses with cross-channel railwaymen and applied constant pressure to achieve this. Frustrated {{with a lack of}} progress the unions threatened to strike in December 1916 which prompted the government to agree to taking control of the Irish lines. On 22 December 1916 they came under Board of Trade supervision which acted through the Irish Railways Executive Committee (IREC).|$|E

Furthermore, he never realized that with the chamber, {{as it was then}} constituted, he only held office at Giolitti's good pleasure. So on 30 March 1911 Luzzatti resigned from his office and King Victor Emmanuel III still gave Giolitti the task to form a new cabinet.|$|E

Using the clay had enabled some farmers to switch to growing vegetables, which need more fertile soil. This helped to increase their income.
