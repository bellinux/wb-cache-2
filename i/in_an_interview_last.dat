An {{attempt was made}} to extend the generalizability of the model and to address perceived conceptual limitations. It is argued that these limitations arose from casting the model entirely from a social cognitive perspective. The participant sample consisted of 25 athletes actively competing at the intercollegiate, national, international, or Olympic level. They competed in the following sports: wrestling, basketball, soccer, football, track and field, and triathlon. All participants engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>lasting</b> between 60 and 90 minutes.

Five of these hierarchies corresponded to the original constructs of the sport commitment model. They are Enjoyment, Involvement Alternatives, Investments, Social Constraints, and Involvement Opportunities. These hierarchies also included a number of component themes that served to explicate and differentiate these constructs. The remaining three hierarchies reflected superordinate constructs proposed for addition to the model. They are Transcendence 1 Teleology, Transformation, and Adaptive Functioning 1 Coping. These constructs had a decidedly clinical I humanistic-existential flavour, and they were the inevitable consequence of conducting hermeneutic research using a conceptual repertoire extending beyond social cognition. The end result was a richer, denser, more complex theoretical model that can now be tested using positivistic, quantitative methodologies...|$|R

Waugh then backed up for a third run, but Martyn pleaded to him emphatically enough to ignore the run. However, by the time Waugh did heed the call, {{it was too late}} for him to turn around. Martyn then sacrificed his wicket for his captain's. He was run out by Harbhajan Singh's throw from the deep, which Parthiv Patel took and whipped off the bails. However, the strangeness of the dismissal was accentuated by the fact that the ball was a no-ball. Waugh could not redeem himself as he got out shortly to a short ball by Zaheer Khan, and while trying to negotiate a ball from Zaheer, overbalanced and trod on his stumps.

40|$|Background Few cancers pose greater {{challenges}} than {{head and}} neck (H&N) cancer. Residual effects following treatment include body image changes, pain, fatigue and difficulties with appetite, swallowing and speech. Depression is a common comorbidity. There is limited evidence about ways to assist patients to achieve optimal adjustment after completion of treatment. In this study, we aim to examine the effectiveness and feasibility of a model of survivorship care {{to improve the quality}} of life of patients who have completed treatment for H&N cancer. Methods This is <b>a</b> preliminary study <b>in</b> which 120 patients will be recruited. A prospective randomised controlled trial of the H&N Cancer Survivor Self-management Care Plan (HNCP) involving pre- and post-intervention assessments will be used. Consecutive patients who have completed a defined treatment protocol for H&N cancer will be recruited from two large cancer services and randomly allocated to one of three study arms: (1) usual care, (2) information in the form of a written resource or (3) the HNCP delivered by an oncology nurse who has participated in manual-based training and skill development in patient self-management support. The trained nurses will meet patients <b>in</b> <b>a</b> face-to-face <b>interview</b> <b>lasting</b> up to 60 minutes to develop an individualised HNCP, based on principles of chronic disease self-management. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months. The primary outcome measure is quality of life. The secondary outcome measures include mood, self-efficacy and health-care utilisation. The feasibility of implementing this intervention in routine clinical care will be assessed through semistructured interviews with participating nurses, managers and administrators. Interviews with patients who received the HNCP will explore their perceptions of the HNCP, including factors that assisted them in achieving behavioural change. Discussion In this study, we aim {{to improve the quality of}} life of a patient population with unique needs by means of a tailored self-management care plan developed upon completion of treatment. Delivery of the intervention by trained oncology nurses is likely to be acceptable to patients and, if successful, will be a model of care that can be implemented for diverse patient populations...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{has taken an}} exploratory view into researching the five senses and their inclusion within corporate marketing and public relations events. It looked to discover if {{the inclusion of the}} senses helped to increase event participants overall enjoyment, engagement and general willingness to participate. The aims and objectives of the study were to determine if, according to event managers, the senses are considered to be a crucial aspect of the event design and are therefore included in the event plan prior to execution, and whether the senses, through experience, have been seen to increase participant experiences, offering further opportunities for guests to engage with the event and the company and further involve themselves within the environment. The final aim and objective is to explore one sense’s importance in order to ascertain knowledge of the hierarchy of the senses and to discover if there is one sense found to be held in higher regard by study participants (event managers). A literature review was performed prior to the primary research taking place. From this several themes emerged: it was found that emotional branding of companies increases their attractiveness to potential customers; experience is developing as a crucial aspect of all businesses and people no longer buy a product or service for functionality reasons alone; multi sensory experiences help to interact with clients and guests encouraging value creation; and, finally, sight became apparent as the most discussed sense expressing the dominance it has over the other senses. From this {{it became clear that the}} event design process, in most cases, did not include a multi-sensory experience understanding and a hierarchy of the senses in terms of event guest experiences. From this a qualitative research method was deemed most appropriate and the study comprised a sample size of eight participants whom took part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>lasting</b> approximately 15 minutes. Participants were encouraged to discuss the outlined topics with little limitations to framework, offering un-biased responses. The main findings of the research were that the study participants found the five senses, as a whole package, were considered to be a key part of the event design; however, in slight contrast to this, another one of the study findings presented the idea of a subconscious understanding that the senses and their inclusion was based on second nature acknowledgement. The senses were found to increase guests overall experience, participation and engagement via their inclusion and, finally, in support of the literature, sight was found to be the sense most highly regarded by event managers as the key sense in events...|$|R
40|$|Participation in {{organised}} {{youth sports}} (OYS) has been recommended {{as an opportunity}} to increase young peoples' physical activity (PA) levels. While coaches can potentially influence athletes' PA levels, what has not been explored is the question; do coaches perceive themselves as influential on PA for girls in OYS? Participants were 30 coaches of girls OYS teams aged 9 - 17 years in the Greater Sydney Metropolitan Area, Australia. Participants took part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-structured <b>interview</b> that <b>lasted</b> approximately 30 minutes. They responded to questions regarding their perceived role as coaches, their perceptions of themselves as role models for PA, their views on their athletes' current PA levels, their opinions on improving their athletes' PA levels, and their perceived challenges as coaches in OYS. Many coaches considered themselves role models for PA due to their own involvement in organised sports. Coaches felt that they were conscious of girls' PA levels during training and could accurately gauge how active girls were. Coaches perceived their training sessions to provide sufficient PA and thus, did not feel the need to try to increase PA during training. Many coaches were cautious about conducting training sessions where the PA intensity was high for prolonged periods because they believed that it could potentially result in dropout from OYS. Coaches' perceived time commitment to OYS, variability of skill/experience amongst girls, and poor parental support as major challenges they experienced in OYS. This study provided a unique insight from the perspective of coaches in OYS. Most coaches felt that they had the potential to influence PA for girls in OYS; however, coaches may underestimate or not fully realise the impact they can have on the girls they coach. Future research should focus on educating coaches to capitalise on the opportunity they have to promote PA through OYS...|$|R

With the majority of research focused on North American and Canadian sport relatively little is known about initiation activities <b>in</b> <b>a</b> United Kingdom context, or why athletes engage in such behaviours. Waldron and Kowalski (2009, Research Quarterly for Exercise and Sport, 80, 291 - 302) have suggested that engagement could be explained by over conformity to two elements of the sport ethic model (Hughes and Coakley, 1991, Sociology of Sport Journal, 8, 307 - 325), namely making sacrifices and striving for distinction. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to examine the nature of initiation activities in male university sport players and explore whether emergent themes mapped to the sport ethic model. Following institutional ethical approval information advertising the study was sent to sporting societies at several higher education institutions. Athletes who met the inclusion criteria of having participated <b>in</b> <b>an</b> initiation ceremony were invited to contact the research team. This random purposeful sampling approach (Patton, 2002, Qualitative evaluation and research methods (3 rd Ed.). California: Sage) resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> participant sample of 19 male athletes (mean age: 20. 4 ± 1. 5 years) representing a range of sports. After giving informed consent each athlete participated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>lasting</b> between 35 - 50 min. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed through a two phase procedure of data organization and interpretation following established thematic analysis guidelines (Braun and Clarke, 2006, Qualitative Research in Psychology, 3, 77 - 101). Results were captured within two dimensions, the initiation and outcomes representing 6 and 2 themes respectively. Within these dimensions emerging themes of the group structure and hierarchy, shared experiences, coercion, initiation challenges, health risk behaviours through alcohol consumption, and feelings of being a team member mapped to the four areas of the sport ethic model in contrast to the work of Waldron and Kowalski (2009). These findings suggest that there are both similarities and differences in initiation activity engagement of UK student athletes compared to the United States. Furthermore, the highlighted differences in over conformity to the sport ethic model suggest that intervention development to deter participation in initiation activities should be context and culturally specific...|$|R

Feelings of shame and fear of poor supervisory evaluations, however, {{have been reported to}} be contributing factors to supervisees choosing to actively refrain from disclosing information to their supervisors. In response to reports of non-disclosure, the present study investigated how supervisors approach supervisee personal disclosures in supervision including their opinions of what constitutes appropriate disclosure, factors contributing to their views of appropriateness, and how they respond to supervisee personal self-disclosures. Experienced supervisors were invited to participate through email invitations distributed via training directors of local training sites as well as through list-serv postings to professional clinical practice online forums. Nine participants who met inclusion criteria were invited to participate <b>in</b> <b>an</b> individual semi-structured <b>interview</b> <b>lasting</b> approximately 45 -minutes to 1 -hour. The interview protocol investigated five research questions focusing on: definitions of personal self-disclosures, supervisor classifications of the appropriateness of different examples of supervisee personal self-disclosure, factors influencing their categorizations, actions supervisors take or opt out of taking towards such disclosures, and their recommendations for managing personal self-disclosures. Consensual qualitative research methodology was used to analyze interview data and draw conclusions (CQR; Hill, 2012). Results revealed participants as a whole struggled to separate purely personal disclosures from professional, clinical references. Also, most supervisee personal disclosures were regarded as generally appropriate. Discussion of supervisor expectations concerning personal disclosures in supervision primarily occurred indirectly either through supervisor modeling of self-disclosure or by discussing personal disclosures as they occurred. The results of this study support the need for supervisors to articulate their expectations regarding personal self-disclosure and for further research to clarify various types of supervisee self-reference...|$|R

40|$|Confucian Heritage Culture (CHC) {{learners}} {{are well}} known for being incredibly motivated {{in the field of}} education and for their apparent reputation in employing what is commonly regarded as <b>a</b> deficit model <b>in</b> their approach to learning. What motivates the CHC Ieamer and do they adopt surface strategies for learning? CHC motivation has previously been explained under sociocultural labels of SOAM (socially-oriented achievement motivation) and attributed to a demonstration of filial piety. These theories are relevant to the social environment of the students but whether existing theories are substantive enough to account for a wider range of motivated behaviour is questioned. These learners demonstrated persistence, determination and motivation in pursuing their learning goals. Self-determination theory (SOT) is the main theoretical framework for investigating these concepts. SOT proposes different degrees of extrinsic motivation and this was significant in explaining the CHC learner's motivation. Secondly, learning approaches of CHC students have been in the forefront of a considerable debate among educators. The question of whether the CHC learner adopts mastery goals, which presupposes the application of deep approaches to learning or performance goals which relies more on surface approaches was examined under achievement goal theory. The question of what made each goal salient was also considered as this has implication for educators. Participants were also asked to identify their attributions for success or failure. A case study design was chosen for this qualitative investigation. This allowed students to express their opinions <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>interview</b> which <b>lasted</b> approximately 35 minutes. Seventeen participants from China, Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia enrolled <b>in</b> <b>a</b> final-year business undergraduate course at Monash University were <b>interviewed.</b> <b>A</b> semi-structured <b>interview</b> protocol was used. These CHC learners demonstrated a greater degree of extrinsic motivation in their choices. Although extrinsic motivation is not ideal for educational outcomes, SOT was used as an interpretive lens to account for their motivated behaviour which was seen to be consistent with the intemalisation of an extrinsic goal. The findings for learning approaches indicated that these participants were skilled in both surface and deep approaches. An intrinsic orientation encouraged mastery goals and adaptive learning approaches. Extrinsic motivational factors were not so clear cut. Evidence of the internalisation of these goals meant that students were adaptive in their approach. However, being motivated to achieve meant that they were strategic and flexible; often adopting both mastery and performance goals and the corresponding deep or surface strategies to fulfil assessment requirements. Ultimately, the factors that made a mastery or performance goal salient was determined by the learning context, assessment requirements and course design and was not a result of the learners' cultural background. These findings were consistent with students' attributions of their success to either: interest, style of assessment, course design or type of subject which encouraged the use of adaptive strategies or surface learning approaches. Therefore, the factors that motivated these students to persist in their studies also influenced their choice of learning approaches. These conclusions have implications for educators to re-examine their course design and assessment requirements. It also challenges the neat dichotomous terminologies previously used to investigate motivational orientation, achievement goals and even attributions for success. Being strategic learners, the CHC students were strategic in their approach and adapted to what was required for success...|$|R
