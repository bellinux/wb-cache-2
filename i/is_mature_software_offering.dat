40|$|Requirements {{engineering}} and <b>software</b> architecture <b>are</b> quite <b>mature</b> <b>software</b> engineering sub-disciplines, which often {{seem to be}} disconnected for many reasons {{and it is difficult}} to perceive the impact of functional and non-functional requirements on architecture and to establish appropriate trace links for traceability purposes. In other cases, the estimation of how non-functional requirements, as the quality properties a system should pose, is not perceived useful enough to produce high-quality software. Therefore, in this special issue, we want to highlight the importance and the role of quality requirements for architecting and building complex software systems that in many cases require multidisciplinary engineering techniques, which increases the complexity of the software development process.

40|$|Research {{in digital}} {{watermarking}} <b>is</b> <b>mature.</b> Several <b>software</b> implementations of watermarking algorithms {{are described in}} the literature, but few {{attempts have been made}} to describe hardware implementations. The ultimate objective of the research presented in this paper was to develop low-power, high- performance, real-time, reliable and secure watermarking systems, which can be achieved through hardware implementations. In this paper, we discuss the development of a very-large-scale integration architecture for a high-performance watermarking chip that can perform both invisible robust and invisible fragile image watermarking in the spatial domain. We prototyped the watermarking chip in two ways: (i) by using a Xilinx field-programmable gate array and (ii) by building a custom integrated circuit. To the best of our knowledge, this prototype is the first watermarking chip with both invisible robust and invisible fragile watermarking capabilities. I...|$|R

40|$|A runtimearchitecture could greatly helpsoftware developersandmaintainers bydescribingobjects {{and their}} {{interactions}} at runtime. As software products evolve, the architectural details {{may not be}} properly maintained in the existing documentation; therefore, inconsistencies may appear between the architectural view and the code. Extracting a runtime architecture from the code requires a hierarchical organization of objects. Since object hierarchy is not directly observable in the code, we use ownership domain annotations. Asoundstaticanalysisanalyzes theannotatedcodeandextracts anownershipobjectgraph(OOG). By refining the annotations, we can push objects that express implementation details underneath more architecturally relevant ones. The refined OOG conveys architectural abstraction and we can check if the OOG conforms a documented architectural view drawn by developers. In this report, we describe the use of ownership domain type system on the legacy code of Apache FtpServer, which <b>is</b> a <b>mature</b> <b>software</b> system developed by experienced programmers. We use an existing analysis to extract the OOG and iteratively refine the OOG until it conforms to a standard architectural pattern or to a reference runtime architecture available in the documentation...|$|R

The {{purpose of}} this large scale {{software}} system is to become the “canonical ” Monte Carlo for Neutrino Interaction Physics whose validity will extend to all neutrino types and nuclear targets in the energy range from a few MeV to hundreds of TeV. GENIE attempts to unify the Monte Carlo generation approaches used {{by a host of}} different, smaller procedural systems in a modern object-oriented software design. It <b>is</b> already a <b>mature</b> <b>software</b> system that currently consists of ∼ 100 000 lines of C++ code (∼ 350 classes organised in ∼ 40 packages). The first official, extensively validated, release of the GENIE Monte Carlo (version 2. 0. 0) is now publicly available. This production version is primarily intended for the on-going analyses of the MINOS experiment, since it features a complete adaptation of NeuGEN [H. Gallagher, Nucl. Phys. Proc.

In {{order to get the}} real-time understanding of marine dynamic change information, the observed data need to be translated back on time to the terrestrial laboratory and the scientists can analyze them. By the communication way of general packet radio service(GPRS), code division multiple access(CDMA) and “Beidou” satellite, a large range of data transmission network of covering China offshore area is formed and the real-time observation data and the buoy state information is transmitted to ground-based data station. In ground-based station, the data received software is compiled and installed, which make the data are received and displayed.

MapReduce has been increasingly adopted {{for over a decade}} by many companies, and more recently, it has attracted the attention of an increasing number of researchers in several areas. One main advantage is that the complex details of parallel processing, such as complex network programming, task scheduling, data placement, and fault tolerance, are hidden in a conceptually simple framework. MapReduce <b>is</b> supported by <b>mature</b> <b>software</b> technologies for deployment in data centers such as Hadoop. As MapReduce becomes popular for high-performance applications, many questions arise concerning its performance and efficiency. In this paper, we demonstrated formally lower bounds on the isoefficiency function for MapReduce applications, when these applications can be modeled as BSP jobs. We also demonstrate how communication and synchronization costs can be dominant for MapReduce computations and discuss the conditions under which such scalability limits are valid. To our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates scalability bounds for MapReduce applications. We also discuss how some MapReduce implementations such as Hadoop can mitigate such costs to approach linear, or near-to-linear speedups...|$|R
