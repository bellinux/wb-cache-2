50|$|On April 1, 2011, AMC {{started a}} new rewards program known as AMC Stubs. This program can be {{purchased}} for a fee of $15 for an entire year. For that initial fee, each AMC Stubs member will receive $5 on every $50 spent between the box office and the concession stand at any AMC theatre nationwide. AMC Stubs members also receive a <b>free</b> <b>size</b> upgrade with every popcorn and drink they purchase (for example, an AMC Stubs member can get a large popcorn {{for the price of}} a regular). AMC Stubs members can also waive the ticketing fees for online ticketing sites such as MovieTickets.com and Fandango. Receipts or ticket stubs are required for manual adjustments. No more than four manual adjustments will be allowed per account in a single calendar month. Manual adjustments will be made for purchases made within 30 calendar days from date of original purchase. As of March 29, 2012, AMC Stubs had 3.2 million members, which represents approximately 18% of AMC attendance during fiscal 2012. In July 2016, AMC Stubs became two programs: the free AMC Stubs Insider, and and the fee-based AMC Stubs Premiere.|$|E

40|$|The free {{volume in}} {{polymers}} is coupled to several important physical properties, such as density, viscosity and gas diffusivity. The physical properties of polymers {{close to a}} solid surface {{have been shown to}} be significantly perturbed as compared to their bulk state. The behavior of polymers close to surfaces comes into play within the field of polymer composites, where the properties of the interface between the filler and the polymer matrix plays a key role in determining the final performance of the composite. This thesis is aimed at studying the effect of surfaces, introduced as nano-sized fillers, on the free volume and physical properties of polymers. Positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS), which involves measurement of ortho-positronium (o-Ps) lifetime was used to determine <b>free</b> volume cavity <b>sizes.</b> Nano-sized fillers, fumed silica and layered silicate, were observed to have a relatively small effect on the mean <b>free</b> volume cavity <b>size</b> in poly(dimethylsiloxane) and poly(amide 6), respectively. The polymer <b>free</b> volume <b>sizes</b> were generally increased upon addition of filler. In poly(1 -trimethylsilyl- 1 -propyne) (PTMSP) nano-sized fumed silica filler was discovered to have a pronounced effect on <b>free</b> volume <b>sizes.</b> The <b>free</b> volume cavity <b>sizes</b> in PTMSP increased with increasing filler content. Large cavities, in the mesopore range, were observed in PTMSP fumed silica nanocomposites. The mesopores were not present in unfilled PTMSP. Increasing gas permeability and decreasing selectivity with increasing filler content, suggested the presence of mesopores to be of importance for the gas transport properties...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} 90 years, {{a lot of}} works have been {{published}} about rolling theories for the two-roll rolling process (2 RP). In the last decades, the three-roll process (3 RP) has become a significant technique {{in the production of}} wire rod and bars, as it allows to cover a wide range of finished dimensions with one pass design, or to realize very close tolerances, depending on the pass design method used (<b>free</b> <b>size</b> rolling or high precision rolling). Horihata and Motomura [2] made use of the upper bound theorem to construct a method for spread calculation, but up to now, a straightforward mathematical method for calculation of stress distribution, roll forces, torques and forward slip is still missing. The present paper aims at a transfer of the slab method, which is well-known and established for the 2 RP, to the 3 RP. After the rolling theory for flat passes is introduced, Lendl’s equivalent pass method is transferred to the 3 RP, which allows the calculation of section passes. Computational results show, that roll forces, torques and forward slips can be calculated under inclusion of elastic stand feedback and interstand tensions. Therefore the model can be used for roll speed set-up to minimize interstand tensions, which is of great importance for the rolling industry...|$|E
40|$|To {{explore the}} effect of filler on the {{electrical}} conductivity of polymer nanocomposites, polystyrene co-acrylonitrile and TiO 2 (PSAN/TiO 2) nanocomposites of different TiO 2 wt% have been prepared. The microstructural characterization has been performed by positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). Positron lifetime parameters viz. o-Ps lifetime (τ 3) and <b>free</b> volume <b>size</b> (Vf) decreases up to 0. 6 wt% suggests the filling of the cavities by Ti 3 + and O− ions as well as complex formation. The increased <b>free</b> volume <b>size</b> (Vf) after 0. 6 wt% of TiO 2 was attributed to the o-Ps annihilation at the interface of PSAN and TiO 2 nanoclusters. The variation of electrical conductivity at lower and higher concentration of TiO 2 is attributed to the blocking effect and space charge effect, respectively. The electrical conductivity decreases along with the <b>free</b> volume <b>sizes</b> at lower concentration of TiO 2 due to the hindrance of the ions mobility. The increased conductivity with the increased <b>free</b> volume <b>sizes</b> indicates the formation of more void space at the interface due {{to the formation of}} TiO 2 nanoclusters. The surface morphology of the nanocomposites studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows uniform dispersion at the lower wt% of TiO 2 and increased size of nanocluster formation at the higher concentration of TiO 2 nanoparticles in PSAN matrix. The crystallinity evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) results also indicates the formation of TiO 2 nanoclusters between 0. 6 and 1. 0 wt% of TiO 2.

Stress distributions in prestressed membrane structures, according to cutting patterns prepared by the help of various numerical methods, were compared.

The close connection between the shrinking of the cutting pattern and the stressing process of the tent was shown. Shrinking of the cutting pattern means that the stress <b>free</b> <b>size</b> of the tent is smaller than the boundaries of the theoretical shape, the tent structure achieves its shape and prestress during stressing on the original edges. The shrinking can be uniform or proportional to the stresses in the theoretical shape. The cutting pattern prepared without shrinking, produces tent surface that fits to the original boundaries without any strain and stress. To get prestress in the structure, the boundary conditions have to be changed.   Cutting patterns prepared by the help of different methods and based on various models, without shrinking and with different shrinking, were analyzed. After the short demonstration of the different methods, the stresses in warp and weft directions were compared in the different construction shapes. ...|$|E

The upper rio Iguaçu basin {{is located in}} the left margin of the medium course of the rio Paraná, it possess 103 tributaries and headwater occur at East of the Serra do Mar mountain. It shows a poor ichthyofauna with high endemism degree, also with Characiformes and Siluriformes prevalence. Recently, Astyanax altiparanae has been found in the rio Iguaçu basin, being not registered up to 1983, for that it is discussed there origin. The Astyanax altiparanae species show diploid number with 2 n= 50 chromosomes and difference in their karyotypic formula and the chromosomes bearing the nucleolar organizing regions. In this work the Astyanax altiparanae karyotype of upper rio Tibagi and upper rio Iguaçu basins populations was characterized, using conventional stain with Giemsa, and differential with C-banding, Ag-NORs, base-specific fluorochrome (chromomycin A 3) and in situ hybridization with rDNA 18 S and 5 S probes.
