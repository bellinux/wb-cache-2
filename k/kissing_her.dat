5|$|Anthony first appears when he poses as {{a member}} of the Walford council to help Eddie eject a {{squatter}} from a premises that they want to move their antiques business into. He then decides to remain in Walford and helps his father set up the business. Anthony buys some candlesticks from Cora Cross (Ann Mitchell), though she does not know their true value, but when Cora finds out their true value, she accuses Anthony of scamming her. Eddie sells the candlesticks for £8000, and when Tyler decides to take part in an unlicensed boxing match, Michael convinces Anthony that Tyler will win and that it would be a good idea to place a bet on him, knowing that Anthony suffers with a gambling addiction. Anthony steals £8000 from Eddie's safe, but bets on Tyler's opponent Artie Stiller (Maurice Lee), which leaves Michael unimpressed, as he has researched Artie and found out he is tough. During the fight, however, Tyler narrowly wins so Anthony has to confess to Eddie that he has lost the money. Shortly after he does, Tyler collapses and has a seizure, so is rushed to hospital. Eddie is sickened by Anthony's actions and tells him he wishes he was dying in a hospital bed, rather than Tyler. Distraught, Anthony storms out and attends a party run by Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton), culminating in him <b>kissing</b> <b>her.</b> Afterwards, Anthony returns to the hospital to learn that Tyler has been taken for a life-saving operation and is furious that Eddie was not around. Eddie then admits that his children would be better off without him. Tyler survives and recovers, but the brothers are told by Eddie that Michael set up an unfair fight to punish the family, leading Tyler and Anthony to reject Michael. Eddie then leaves Walford, leaving Tyler and Anthony the antiques business.|$|E
5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) offers free family {{portraits in}} the office, and {{many members of}} the office take {{advantage}} of the opportunity, including Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) with his very elderly parents, Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) with his teenaged daughter Sasha, Meredith Palmer (Kate Flannery) with her teenaged son, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) with Ravi (Sendhil Ramamurthy), a desperate Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) trying to win back Kelly's affection yet again, and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) with a reluctant Jim (John Krasinski) and their children Cecelia and Philip. Senator Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) later comes by with his and Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) son Philip to also get a family portrait. Jim suspects that Dwight's motive for giving away family portraits was to get revenge on Jim for a prank involving a fake Velcro suit, but Dwight's real motive was to try to get some of Philip Lipton's DNA to run a test to determine who Philip's actual father is. Angela is very much against this idea and tries to ensure that Dwight does not get the opportunity. After taking the pictures, Robert notices that Philip's diaper is full, so he goes to change him. After doing so Dwight goes into the bathroom to retrieve the diaper, but Angela chases after him as he makes a break for the hospital to run the DNA test. Dwight and Angela then take part in a high-speed car chase until Dwight calls his cousin Mose (Michael Schur) to take her off his trail with a duplicate Trans Am. Angela later finds him in the hospital waiting area, where he confirms {{he is going to be}} there for the entire 72-hour waiting period for the DNA results. After she sits down, holding his hand, Dwight begins <b>kissing</b> <b>her</b> and Angela briefly demurs before passionately kissing him in return.|$|E

Female actresses were often turned into stars based on their screen portrayals of passion. Actresses like Nazimova, Pola Negri, Vilma Bánky and Greta Garbo, became screen idols as a result.|$|E

There he finds his father, Daniel Niall, and discovers that his mother died just before Yule, when he was training Morgan.

25|$|In early 2000, Helena lets Lucky (now Young) go and {{it becomes}} clear he has been brainwashed. Helena uses the Ice Princess diamond to make Lucky act violently and erases Lucky's {{memories}} of love for Elizabeth. Elizabeth fakes her death to help Nikolas (then Stephen Martines, credited as Coltin Scott) gain Helena's trust, and Lucky's visions of her and their love help him break Helena's control. They reunite, but {{he is unable to}} regain his feelings and in December 2001, Elizabeth stops their wedding when she realizes the truth. They struggle to start over, and Elizabeth breaks up with Lucky after she finds him <b>kissing</b> <b>her</b> sister Sarah Webber (then Sarah Laine). In August 2002, Lucky and Nikolas try to cover up the death of Laura's stepfather Rick Webber (Chris Robinson) when they think Luke killed him. When Laura is told she killed Rick, she has a mental breakdown and has to be committed. Luke acts self-destructively and Nikolas takes control of Laura's treatment, causing tension between Luke and Lucky (now Vaughan). When Lucky's girlfriend Summer Halloway (Brittney Powell) is pushed off a cliff, he joins the police academy to help find evidence. Luke is unhappy that Lucky has become a cop, causing various rifts between them. In February 2004, Lucky almost dies during a fire at the Port Charles Hotel. When Nikolas (reprised by Christopher) is presumed dead in April, Lucky comforts Emily (now Natalia Livingston) and develops romantic feelings she does not return. Lucky is suspended for helping Nikolas when he presumably kills Helena. Lucky finds Helena, who shoots him, putting him into a coma. Luke unplugs his ventilator, causing him to breathe on his own. Meanwhile, Lucky and Elizabeth reconnect. Their financial struggles prompt Elizabeth to become a surrogate mother for Courtney (Alicia Leigh Willis) and Jasper Jacks (Ingo Rademacher), upsetting Lucky, but Elizabeth miscarries in September 2005. They marry in October, and raises Liz's son Cameron as his own. Lucky almost dies in a train crash on the way to their honeymoon, and again during an encephalitis outbreak in February 2006. In April, he has a serious back injury while trying to save Elizabeth from Manny Ruiz (Robert LaSardo). Overcome by his injury, financial trouble and guilt over the death of his partner Jesse Beaudry (Matt Marraccini), Lucky becomes addicted to painkillers and has an affair with Maxie Jones (Kirsten Storms). Elizabeth walks in on them, and sleeps with Jason Morgan, becoming pregnant. She lets Lucky believe he is the father to avoid him relapsing. Maxie fakes a pregnancy in an unsuccessful attempt to keep Lucky. Elizabeth divorces Lucky, but they remarry after he completes rehab. In May 2007, Elizabeth gives birth to Jacob Spencer. Her relationship with Jason makes Lucky jealous, and their marriage struggles. Lucky starts dating Jason's ex-girlfriend Sam McCall (Kelly Monaco) as they divorce. In November 2007, Lucky discovers the truth about Jake, but agrees to the secret to protect him from Jason's dangerous lifestyle. Lucky and Sam break up.|$|E

500|$|The {{final scene}} in which Peggy leaves both Don and the agency was pinpointed by critics as a {{standout}} sequence. Maureen Ryan said, [...] "the scene between Don and Peggy was tremendous, but Jon Hamm and Elisabeth Moss are always magnificent together.

500|$|Maggie {{dreams that}} the entire family has become puppets in a theater. As the Simpsons prepare {{for a trip to}} Hawaii and ask Moe to house-sit for them, Homer's boss Mr. Burns pays a {{surprise}} visit. He soon learns that Homer has feigned a neck injury to get time off work for the trip and calls his attack hounds on him. However, only one arrives (represented by a crude sock puppet), since the show has spent its budget on Katy Perry, who appears as herself and Moe's girlfriend. Noticing that Burns is disappointed by the lack of his attack hounds, Katy gives him a kiss. Touched by this, Burns decides to forgive the Simpsons and allows them to enjoy their trip in Hawaii, and then everyone sings a parody of [...] "Twelve Days of Christmas" [...] which plays during the credits. At the end of the credits, Moe attempts to kiss Katy but is not tall enough to reach her mouth, so he instead opts to kiss her bellybutton through her dress. Katy retorts that he is not <b>kissing</b> <b>her</b> bellybutton, meaning that he is actually <b>kissing</b> <b>her</b> vulva, but also says she did not tell Moe to stop.|$|E

[...] But, for some reason, he does not remember when he did first <b>kiss</b> <b>her,</b> though he had looked forward to that miracle for weeks.

Both carried a lance, longsword, a heavy battle axe known as the [...] "Holy Trinity" [...] and a long dagger called the [...] "misericordia". Carrouges {{appeared}} first, reciting his charges against Le Gris to the King and crowd before Le Gris followed and did the same. Le Gris was then knighted in order that he and Carrouges be of equal standing during the fight. Both knights then dismounted and gave oaths to God, the Virgin Mary and St George, thereby sanctifying God's judgment over the duel's outcome. Finally, Carrouges approached his wife and pledged his honour before her, <b>kissing</b> <b>her</b> and promising to return.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{also spoke}} about O'Neal in 2001 with Rabbi Shmuley. He {{described}} holding hands with her: [...] "I was, like, in heaven. It {{was the most}} magical thing.

And I was watching the band, I was sitting there, and underneath the table, she was holding my hand, and I was, like melting. [...] Fireworks going off. It was all I needed.

On the taped edition of Raw that aired September 3, 2007, McMahon, along with her mother Linda and her brother Shane, made several appearances to confront Mr. McMahon about the child, who was later revealed to be Hornswoggle, turning into a fan favorite.
