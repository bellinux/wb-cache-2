40|$|Tournaments, reward {{structures}} {{based on}} rank order, are compared with individual contracts {{in a model}} with one risk-neutral principal and many risk-averse agents. Each agents' output is a stochastic function of his effort level plus an additive shock term that is common to all the agents. The principal observes only the output levels of the agents. It is shown that {{in the absence of}} a common shock, using optimal <b>independent</b> <b>contracts</b> dominates using the optimal tournament. Conversely, if the distribution of the common shock is sufficiently diffuse, using the optimal tournament dominates using optimal <b>independent</b> <b>contracts.</b> Finally, it is shown that for a sufficiently large number of agents, a principal who cannot observe the common shock but uses the optimal tournament, does as well as one who can observe the shock and uses <b>independent</b> <b>contracts.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Using job-spell data {{based on}} an {{original}} survey of Information Technology (IT) degree graduates from five U. S. universities, the authors investigate the link between contracting {{and a set of}} job characteristics (accommodating flexible work hours, total work hours, and working from home) associated with work-life needs. Compared with regular employees in similar jobs, workers in both independent- and agency-contracting jobs report more often working at home and working fewer hours per week. Further, agency <b>contracting</b> (but not <b>independent</b> <b>contracting)</b> is associated with lower odds of being able to set one’s own work hours. Important differences also emerge in workplaces of varying sizes. For each job characteristic, as workplace size increases, <b>independent</b> <b>contracting</b> jobs deteriorate relative to regular employment jobs. As a consequence, in large workplaces, <b>independent</b> <b>contracting</b> jobs appear to be less accommodating of work-life needs than regular employment jobs...|$|R
40|$|I analyze {{a common}} agency {{relationship}} where the agent has private {{information about the}} difference in his value for two principals. When the principals independently offer incentive contracts, the agent specializes less than is socially efficient, but more than when they cooperate and choose the contract that maximizes their joint payoff. Under both arrangements the agent faces countervailing incentives. The pooling region of types receiving a flat fee is larger and the incentive pay of the remaining types is lower powered under cooperation than under <b>independent</b> <b>contracting.</b> The principals prefer <b>independent</b> <b>contracting</b> with a common agent to exclusive dealing. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{test the}} {{implications}} of ambiguity aversion in a principal-agent problem with multiple agents. When output distributions are uncertain, models of ambiguity aversion suggest that tournaments may become more attractive than <b>independent</b> wage <b>contracts,</b> {{in contrast to the}} case where output distributions are known. We do so by presenting agents with a choice between tournaments and <b>independent</b> <b>contracts,</b> which are designed in a way that under uncertainty about output distribution (that is, under ambiguity), ambiguity averse agents should typically prefer tournaments, while ambiguity neutral agents prefer <b>independent</b> <b>contracts,</b> <b>independent</b> of their degree of risk aversion. This is the case, because the tournament removes all ambiguity about the equilibrium wages. We compare the share of participants who choose the tournament under ambiguity with the share of participants choosing the tournament in a control treatment, where output distributions are know. As the theory predicts, we find indeed that under ambiguity the share of agents who choose the tournaments is higher than in the case of known output distributions.

Principal-agent frameworks are considered in which two principals share one common agent that is performing one single task but each prefers the different aspect of the task. Three models are built and decision mechanisms are given. The studies show that the three modes have different effects. Exclusive dealing mode is not good for long-term effect because sometimes it guides agent ignoring repayment. If effort proportionality coefficient and observability are both unchanged, principals all prefer common agency, but <b>independent</b> <b>contracting</b> mode may be more efficient in reality because not only the total outputs under that mode are larger than those under cooperation one, but also preferring <b>independent</b> <b>contracting</b> mode can stimulate the bank participating in the game...|$|R
