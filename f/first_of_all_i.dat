We have not yet begun to pioneer in those things that are human and social… I think that social work is uniquely {{equipped}} {{to play a major role}} in this social and human renaissance of our society, which will, if successful, lead to its survival, and if it is unsuccessful, will lead to its justifiable death.|$|E
500|$|In {{preparation}} for the role, Kensit spent three days shadowing a real nurse, and observed open heart surgery being performed as research. She commented on the experience: [...] "I wanted to throw up. <b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> stood in the corner {{but in the end}} I couldn't get close enough ... nurses are incredible women. They're doing this job for next to nothing and do it with such love and care... I couldn't do it, I'd get too emotionally involved, I don't think I could cope." [...] In 2001, Kensit had made a guest appearance in series 16 of Holby City sister show Casualty, appearing as a domestic abuse victim and giving what TV critic Ian Hyland deemed [...] "a convincing performance". Prior to her move into television roles, Kensit had predominantly worked in films, but explained upon joining the cast of Holby City: [...] "Making films isn't for me any more because I'm an old girl in that world ... I've been very lucky, this is something I grew up doing, in television there's so much satisfaction ... I'll stay as long as they want me, I feel like I've come back home." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "When {{they asked}} me to do it a second time, I said, 'Certainly,' and {{everybody}} thought I was out of my mind," [...] Burr told Tom Shales of The Washington Post. [...] "But it wasn't the large sum of money. It was the fact that, <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> kind of liked 'Godzilla,' and where do you get the opportunity to play yourself 30 years later? So I said yes to both of them." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Flint," [...] he began, in his {{peculiar}} {{deep and}} resonant voice, [...] "you've said some things to-day that I won't forget. I {{want to tell}} you, <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> that <b>I</b> admire my son." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> don't think it's {{within the}} power of human beings {{to assure that the}} climate does not change, as {{millions}} of years of history have shown, and second of all, I guess I would ask which human beings - where and when - are to be accorded the privilege of deciding that this particular climate that we have right here today, right now is the best climate for all other human beings. I think that's a rather arrogant position for people to take." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon being {{convinced}} {{that he had not}} robbed anyone of their melody, McCartney began writing lyrics to suit it. As Lennon and McCartney were known to do at the time, a substitute working lyric, titled [...] "Scrambled Eggs" [...] (the working opening verse was [...] "Scrambled eggs/Oh my baby how I love your legs/Not as much as I love scrambled eggs"), was used for the song until something more suitable was written. In his biography, , McCartney recalled: [...] "So <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> checked this melody out, and people said to me, 'No, it's lovely, and I'm sure it's all yours.' It took me a little while to allow myself to claim it, but then like a prospector I finally staked my claim; stuck a little sign on it and said, 'Okay, it's mine!' It had no words. I used to call it 'Scrambled Eggs'." [...] The original song, Scrambled Eggs, was written to hold the music and phrasing in place. It was performed by Paul McCartney and Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, and has been recorded and released by the Brittles, a Beatles-pastiche band.|$|E
2500|$|Many critics {{considered}} the song a [...] "diss" [...] towards Lil' Kim, [...] {{who has been}} in disputes with Minaj since the beginning of her career. Mariel Concepcion of Billboard dissected the song stating [...] "Nicki Minaj's highly-talked about [...] "Roman's Revenge" [...] track hit the net over the weekend, and the Harajuku Barbie appears to be taking jabs at Lil' Kim." [...] In the first verse Minaj takes shots saying [...] "Look at my show footage how these girls be spazzing/So fuck I look like getting back to a has-been/Yeah I said it has-been/hang it up/flatscreen" [...] then again [...] "You out of work/I know it's tough/but enough is enough/" [...] Minaj then specifically takes jabs at Baltimore rapper Keys and Lil'Kim in the second verse rapping, [...] "Is this the thanks that I get for putting you bitches on/ is it my fault that all of you bitches gone/" [...] and following this line this infered she was talking about Lil' Kim [...] "Nicki she just mad cause you took the spot/ word that bitch mad cause I took the spot/ Well bitch if you aint shitting then get off the pot/Got some niggas out in Brooklyn that'll off ya top/. Minaj also subliminally took jabs at rapper Keys with [...] "I see them dusty ass Filas, Levi's/ Raggedy Ann's/ Holes in your knee highs". Lil' Kim fired back at the song at a club-concert, stating [...] "I will erase this bitch’s social security number. <b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> don’t even need a record right now and I’d kill that bitch with my old shit. My records ain’t just enter the charts, they made history. What the fuck is this bullshit, this shit come and go!" [...] Minaj later stated in an interview on The Wendy Williams Show that, [...] "They know what I'm talking about. See that's the thing when you put out records; you know only the 'guilty ones' feel like you're talking about them. So you know, if you have nothing to worry about, if you haven't came out saying stuff, if you never came out saying your ungrateful bullshit then you wouldn't worry about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1907 Alfred Richardson {{received}} an open testimonial from the Mayor of Halifax. It was: [...] "Testimony of His Worship, the Mayor of Halifax, Alderman R. D. Ward. JP as {{to four years}} of Alfred Richardson as Chief Constable of Halifax." [...] 1907 had seen the Women's Suffrage Movement make its presence known in Halifax, mainly by a local resident named Lavina Saltonstall (1881–1957). Saltonstall was born near Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, and moved to live permanently in Haugh Road Halifax in 1906. Saltonstall met the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst who had toured the area, especially around 1905/6. She made speeches in Halifax during the tram strike and agitating for reform for women by writing letters. This then evolved into a local suffragette movement in Halifax, which Alfred Richardson had to monitor with care and tact. In 1908 Saltonstall wrote {{an article in the}} local newspaper, The Halifax Guardian, entitled [...] "Our Police System" [...] a by-product of which was to give an insight into the Halifax Police and Chief Constable Richardson. Part of the article stated: [...] "In order to gather a little information, concerning the work of the Police Force, the other day I paid a visit to the Halifax Borough court. <b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> will mention the fact that a friend of mine had business with the Chief Constable, which fact gave us the chance of getting to his office. Presently we came to an inquiry office where we had to await the Chief's pleasure. Photographs of police groups adorned. Presently we received the intimation that the Chief was disengaged, and we walked into another room sumptuously furnished. The Chief himself had taken refuge behind a table on which were books and pens and inks and flowers. Several movable objects in the form of chairs and rulers and books, and also a fire-screen, were placed near him. An ecclesiastical looking individual in belt and buttons, and with a signet ring and a scholarly stoop, he mounted guard over the door by which we had entered. As in the outer office, photographs etc. and the Chief's overcoat, tall hat, and walking-stick adorned the walls." [...] Comments were made in the local press about how well the local constabulary handled the Suffragette Movement in the town from this time (1908) until its demise in 1916. It seems that the Chief Constable met {{with a certain amount of}} approval by Saltonstall.|$|E

6000|$|... '--This has set me thinking, I say,' {{repeated}} Mrs Boffin, cordially beaming {{under the}} influence of her husband's compliment, 'and I have thought two things. <b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> that <b>I</b> have grown timid of reviving John Harmon's name.

I like her best, but I do want a locket like Miss Kent's." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{there are}} two or three things I have in my mind. <b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> {{want to be able}} to watch John Simcoe and this Pentonville man when they are talking together." ...|$|E
6000|$|The man, {{after looking}} keenly about, quietly replied: [...] "I'm wonderin' how you women {{come to be}} here alone, but <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> <b>I</b> {{want to know who}} made them tracks outside the door?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Victor {{outlined}} {{his plan}} of going West and starting anew. To this suggestion his mother listened, then gently replied: [...] "There are many objections to that, Victor. <b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> have no money." ...|$|E

"Yes; I {{feel that}} a public duty rests upon me, and, besides, I must do it for my own safety, unless I choose to allow myself to be hunted by this beast out of the college, {{and that would be}} a little too feeble.

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] he said, [...] "that I {{have any}} {{particular}} objection in detail to your excellent scheme of Government. My only objection is a quite personal one.

5000|$|<b>First</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> when <b>I</b> {{was caught}} on 21 September, I was only {{travelling}} with one Fiat 124, not three vehicles as it {{shows in the}} film...

And my colleague Ahmed Ali was injured on both legs... I think it was not right, the way they portrayed both {{the individual and the}} action. It was not right.|$|R

50|$|The loop body is {{executed}} <b>first</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> with <b>i</b> {{equal to}} 0; i then becomes 1, 2, 3, and finally 4 on successive iterations. At that point, i becomes 5, so i < 5 is false and the loop ends. However, if the comparison used were <= (less {{than or equal}} to), the loop would be carried out six times: i takes the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Likewise, if i were initialized to 1 rather than 0, there would only be four iterations: i takes the values 1, 2, 3, and 4. Both of these alternatives can cause off-by-one errors.|$|R
