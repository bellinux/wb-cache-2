500|$|Reflecting on the band's hiatus in a 2011 interview, Kinney {{told that}} Staley wasn't {{the only one}} battling addiction. [...] "He was the focal point, like singers are. So they’d single him out. But the truth was, {{it was pretty much}} everybody. I {{definitely}} had my hand firmly on the wheel going off the cliff. And the reason we pulled back – you know when you stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E
500|$|Presley was {{a central}} figure in the {{development}} of rockabilly, according to music historians. Katherine Charlton even calls him [...] "rockabilly's originator", though Carl Perkins has explicitly stated that [...] " [...] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly." [...] and, according to Michael Campbell, [...] "Bill Haley recorded the first big rockabilly hit." [...] "It had been there for quite a while", says Scotty Moore. [...] "Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old." [...] However, [...] "Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label", writes Craig Morrison. Paul Friedlander describes the defining elements of rockabilly, which he similarly characterizes as [...] "essentially... an Elvis Presley construction": [...] "the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [...] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [...] country". In [...] "That's All Right", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, [...] "a combination of Merle Travis–style country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herodotus will {{at times}} relate various {{accounts}} of the same story. For example, in Book 1 he mentions both the Phoenician and the Persian accounts of Io. However, Herodotus will at time arbitrate between varying accounts: [...] "I {{am not going to}} say that these events happened one way or the other. Rather, I will point out the man who <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact began the wrong-doing against the Greeks." [...] Again, later, Herodotus claims himself as an authority: [...] "I know this is how it happened because I heard it from the Delphians myself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Idol {{producer}} Nigel Lythgoe, who was unimpressed {{with the}} evidence presented on the Primetime Live special, called it [...] "shoddy journalism". [...] Regarding Clark's possession of Abdul's phone number, Lythgoe said, [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact {{that a lot of}} the contestants have got Paula's phone number and contact her and she contacts them. Paula's the den mother. ... I don't have a problem with that. She's been a star and now she can help them and that's more than Simon [...]" [...] Lythgoe also addressed Clark's claim that he sent Abdul a secret message by singing [...] "I owe it all to you" [...] on the show by explaining that the serenade was choreographed by the producers. [...] Lythgoe also questioned why it took two years for Clark to reveal his alleged affair with Abdul, fueling speculation that Clark was merely attempting to gain publicity for his upcoming album.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}}s, Ringer responded [...] "Honestly, my number-one motivation is my family". While talking about his attitude and upbringing, Ringer mentioned, [...] "A lot of that just comes from my upbringing. I have a tremendous mother and father, I {{grew up in the}} church, I have a very religious family. I’m not all about myself just because I know if it wasn’t for God, I wouldn’t be able {{to go out there and}} compete anyway. So I never look at it as a selfish thing—I never want all the attention or want it to be about me, because I never want to get in to a situation where God has to humble me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact that I am not doing it by myself; it is because of Him that I can compete over and over again. That’s basically how I grew up. I was blessed and fortunate to have a family like I have." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{month before}} Don 2s release Nariman Films, {{producers}} of Don, sent a legal notice to Reliance and Excel Entertainment about the sequel. According to the notice, Nariman {{had given the}} rights to Excel Entertainment in perpetuity for Don alone. The producers replied, [...] "Whatever we have done is legal, so the claim is false {{and so are the}} charges. This is an absolutely new film and there is no question of a delay in releasing Don 2." [...] Khan added in an interview with Mumbai Mirror, [...] "While my producers are best qualified to give a fitting reply to the whole matter, I as a lead actor can say that as for the sequel, the Amitabh Bachchan Don never had a sequel. So where is the question of us copying anything. Farhan and his team have worked on the script, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact that we haven't copied from anywhere and this is an original script." [...] On 19 December, a week before Don 2s release, the Bombay High Court refused to stay the film's release. The court's ruling considered the film's scheduled release on 21 December overseas and 23 December in India, for which many theatres had been booked.|$|E

40|$|The {{process for}} {{producing}} Pterodactyls (Nov. 2001) started {{one and a}} half years prior to an audience member even contemplating stepping into the Robinson Theatre to see a production of a play by the award-winning playwright Nicky Silver. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time that I wanted to direct a play, but Pterodactyls was not always my choice.

2500|$|Inman {{played the}} camp Mr. Wilberforce Claybourne Humphries and his earlier {{career in the}} clothes retail {{business}} was good preparation for this role in a menswear department. Inman developed a characteristic limp-wristed mincing walk, and a high-pitched catchphrase, [...] "I'm free!", which soon entered popular culture. Inman reported that four or {{five members of the}} group Campaign for Homosexual Equality picketed one of his shows in protest as they believed his persona did not help their cause. Inman said that [...] "they thought I was over exaggerating the gay character. But I don't think I do. In fact there are people far more camp than Mr. Humphries walking around this country. Anyway, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fact that an enormous number of viewers like Mr. Humphries and don't really care whether he's camp or not. So far from doing harm to the homosexual image, I feel I might be doing some good". Both Inman and David Croft stated that the character was [...] "just a mother's boy", and that his sexual orientation was never explicitly stated. Inman continued to play in live shows after his success as Mr. Humphries, and began to incorporate camp mannerisms to those performances too, once saying [...] "Even when I'm not playing Mr Humphries, say at a summer season, I camp it up a bit. If I don't the audience are disappointed".|$|E
