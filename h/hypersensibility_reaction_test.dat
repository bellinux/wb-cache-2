Os resultados mostram que para 790 crianças houve 13, 0 % de reatores fracos e 16, 3 % de reatores fortes, com um total de 29, 3 % de reatores. São feitos comentários sobre a vacinação oral e o baixo percentual de reatores encontrados, no controle tuberculínico pós-vacinal, relativamente aos obtidos com o BCG intradérmico. <b>Hypersensibility</b> <b>reaction</b> to {{tuberculin}} (PPD RT- 23) was studied during {{five years}} among children under {{one year of}} age, vaccinated with BCG by oral administration, living {{in an area of}} city S.

40|$|In {{a recent}} review, Volkert and Lundstedt have {{discussed}} the available data which indicated {{the existence of an}} independent cell-mediated immunity to the LCM virus in mice (1). It was concluded that this immunity was provoked during the acute phase of the infection and that it was probably the decisive factor for the outcome of the infection. During the next 2 yr other authors published experimental reports which supported this assumption. Tosolini and Minas employed the footpad test in acutely infected mice and were able to demonstrate the time-course of the development of a D-type <b>hypersensibility</b> <b>reaction</b> (2). Moreover, the original work by Lundstedt which indicated a cytotoxic effect of immune lymphocytes on LCM virus-infected target cells (3) was confirmed by Holtermann and Majde (4). Finally, Wright et al. have employed the Hellstrtim method {{in the same kind of}} experiments and have published data which might indicate that the cytotoxic effect of lymphocytes from immune donors can be suppressed by different kinds of immunosuppressive treatments (5). In spite of the fact that all parties concerned seem to agree on the importance of the cell-mediated immunity to LCM virus, very little is as yet known abou...|$|R
40|$|<b>Reaction</b> <b>tests</b> {{are typical}} tests {{from the field}} of {{psychological}} research and communication science in which a test person is presented some stimulus like a photo, a sound, or written words. The individual has to evaluate the stimulus as fast as possible in a predefined manner and has to react by presenting the result of the evaluation. This could be by pushing a button in simple <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> or by saying an answer in verbal <b>reaction</b> <b>tests.</b> The <b>reaction</b> time between the onset of the stimulus and the onset of the response {{can be used as a}} degree of difficulty for performing the given evaluation. Compared to simple <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> verbal <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> are very powerful since the individual can simply say the answer which is the most natural way of answering. The drawback for verbal <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> is that today the reaction times still have to be determined manually. This means that a person has to listen through all audio recordings taken during test sessions and mark stimuli times and word beginnings one by one which is very time consuming and people-intensive. To replace the manual evaluation of <b>reaction</b> <b>tests</b> this article presents the REACTION (Reaction Time Determination) system which can automatically determine the reaction times of a test session by analyzing the audio recording of the session. The system automatically detects the onsets of stimuli as well as the onsets of answers. The recording is furthermore segmented into parts each containing one stimulus and the following reaction which further facilitates the transcription of the spoken words for a semantic evaluation. 1...|$|R

40|$|To {{understand}} the nature of <b>test</b> <b>reactions</b> and their relationship to test performance, the relationships among belief in <b>tests,</b> pretest <b>reactions,</b> <b>test</b> performance, and posttest reactions were modeled for cognitive ability and personality tests. Results from structural equation models that were fitted to responses from 197 undergraduate examinees supported the hypothesized relationships. On the cognitive ability <b>test,</b> pretest <b>reactions</b> affected <b>test</b> performance and mediated the relationship between belief in tests and test performance. Test performance affected posttest reactions even after taking into account the effect of pretest reactions. On the personality test, belief in tests affected pretest and posttest reactions, but the three variables were unrelated to test performance (Conscientiousness scores).

40|$|Since it {{was held}} in 1924 by Becher to be of value indetermining the degree of renal {{insufficiency}} and consequently in predicting the probable result of patients with renal disease xanthoprotein <b>reaction</b> <b>test</b> has had extensive clinical applications. In recent years, however, clearance test has established themselves as renal function <b>test,</b> and xanthoprotein <b>reaction</b> <b>test</b> has become somewhat outdated and less used than before. In order to review the value of xanthoprotein <b>reaction</b> <b>test</b> and to determine the position at present occupied by it among many renal function tests used as a diagnostic aid, various tests were performed {{and the results were}} compared. The normal value of plasma xanthoprotein reaction level was shown to be 17. 9 ± 0. 6; plasma xanthoprotein reaction was normal in acute nephritis; and it increased as renal function deteriorated in chronic and terminal nephritis. In renal diseases the increase in plasma xanthoprotein reaction levels occurred slightly after the increase in plasma urea-N and plasma creatinine levels. The increase in plasma xanthoprotein levels occurred when glomerulo-tubular unbalance took place, with the values of G. F. R., R. P. F., R. B. F., Tm_, and Tm_G going down below 25 cc, 150 cc, 250 cc, 25 mg. and 100 mg. per minute, respectively. It will be seen from the data produced by the present experiments that xanthoprotein <b>reaction</b> <b>test</b> is of no less value than other methods under consideration in determining the degree of renal insufficiency. It is also of value in diagnosing the onset of true uremia and forecasting the prognosis of patients with renal disease...|$|R

40|$|Glucocorticoids (GCs) {{represent}} {{the most effective}} treatment for autoimmune and allergic diseases, even if collateral effects are not rare, especially endocrine and immunosuppressive manifestations. Moreover, these drugs can develop adverse immunological reactions of I, III or IV type. Though immediate adverse reactions caused by systemic therapy with GCs are not very frequent, the possible beginning of anaphylactic and pseudo-anaphylactic manifestations in patients undergoing therapy with these drugs has to be considered. It has been observed that immediate adverse reactions usually are happened in asthmatic patients and in patients obliged to assume GCs again and again because of their pathology (e. g, kidney transplant). Other risk factors resulted to be female sex and hypersensibility to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). Both {{in the cases of}} pseudo-allergic and allergic reactions, the pharmacological principle is hardly the responsible agent for the reaction; instead the excipients in drugs are often implicated (succinate salt, sulphites and carboxy-methyl-cellulose). It is possible that the IgE-response is highly specific for a fixed GC molecule as well depending on the way of administration and its salification. Moreover, it has been hypothesized that in patients with a first type allergic reaction to GCs there is a fourth type, sensitization to GCs, which is not usually diagnosed and even comes before IgE sensitization. Third type <b>hypersensibility</b> <b>reactions</b> may occur, too. Since GCs are large-scale drugs, also in emergency medicine and reanimation, allergic sensitization towards them, although infrequent, gives many interventionist problems. In the light of this feature, it seems of crucial importance to verify the tolerance toward other GC molecules. And in particular, it has been noted that patients presenting immediate reactions to hydrocortisone (HC) and methylprednisolone (MP) could tolerate prednisone and prednisolone per os and second-generation GCs, such as desamathazone and betamethazone. Nevertheless, second-generation GCs must not be considered safe; in fact, the beginning of allergic manifestations has been pointed out even towards them...|$|R
