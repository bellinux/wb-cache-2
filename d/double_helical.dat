An astern turbine was incorporated in the exhaust casing of the low-pressure turbine, and a cruising turbine was coupled directly to the high-pressure turbine.

40|$|Abstract. The two gears of the <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> gear is a mesh of a concave/convex combination. Because the {{curvature}} {{is close to}} each other, the strength also increased and thus, it is often used in heavily-loaded workplaces. The national standard for <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> gear (ex., GB 12759 - 91) {{is based on the}} size of the gear module to design its tooth profile. This shows that tooth geometric-related designs are quite complicated. If the effect of the different pressure angle parameter is considered, we would be unable to conduct relevant studies for the original standard formula with a <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> gear set at a pressure angle of 24 °. Firstly, this paper would redefine a new <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> gear according to the discontinuousness tooth profile molded line of the <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> gear and unchangeable pressure angle and explain the improvements in the design and stress analysis of the tooth especially since the <b>double</b> circular-arc <b>helical</b> gear has no limitation in the minimum number of teeth. Thus, the decrease in the driving gears’ number of module and can further increase the reduction gear ratio. For heavily-loaded planetary gear reducer, it’s quite obvious in the miniaturizing and high torque superiority. This paper also used certain winch’s speed reducer as example to explain that the change of the pressure angle can reduce contact stress by 3 %~ 40 % and also enhances the torque ability by 3 %~ 40 %...|$|R

The tests were carried out on one, two, three and four numbers of anchors in sand for different depths of embedment keeping shallow and deep mode of behaviour in mind. The testing program included 48 tests conducted on three model anchors installed in sand whose density kept constant throughout the tests. It was observed that the ultimate pullout load varied significantly with the installation depth of the anchor and the number of anchors. The apparent coefficient of friction (f*) between anchor and soil was also calculated based on the test results. It was found that the apparent coefficient of friction varies between 1. 02 and 4. 76 for 1, 2, 3 and 4 numbers of single, <b>double</b> and triple <b>helical</b> screw anchors. Plate load tests conducted on model soil showed that the value of ф increases from 35 o for virgin soil to 48 o for soil with four <b>double</b> screw <b>helical</b> anchors.

2500|$|Another key {{to finding}} the correct {{structure}} of DNA was the so-called Chargaff ratios, experimentally determined ratios of the nucleotide subunits of DNA: the amount of guanine is equal to cytosine {{and the amount of}} adenine is equal to thymine. A visit by Erwin Chargaff to England, in 1952, reinforced the salience of this important fact for Watson and Crick. The significance of these ratios for the structure of DNA were not recognized until Watson, persisting in building structural models, realized that A:T and C:G pairs are structurally similar. In particular, the length of each base pair is the same. Chargaff had also pointed out to Watson that, in the aqueous, saline environment of the cell, the predominant tautomers of the pyrimidine (C and T) bases would be the amine and keto configurations of cytosine and thymine, rather than the imino and enol forms that Crick and Watson had assumed. They consulted Jerry Donohue who confirmed the most likely structures of the nucleotide bases. The base pairs are held together by hydrogen bonds, the same non-covalent interaction that stabilize the protein α-helix. [...] The correct structures were essential for the positioning of the hydrogen bonds. [...] These insights led Watson to deduce the true biological relationships of the A:T and C:G pairs.

40|$|AbstractThe {{deoxyhemoglobin}} S (deoxy-HbS) {{double strand}} {{is the fundamental}} building block of both the crystals of deoxy-HbS and the physiologically relevant fibers present within sickle cells. To use the atomic-resolution detail of the hemoglobin-hemoglobin interaction known from the crystallography of HbS {{as a basis for}} understanding the interactions in the fibers, it is necessary to define precisely the relationship between the straight double strands in the crystal and the twisted, <b>helical</b> <b>double</b> strands in the fibers. The intermolecular contact conferring the stability of the double strand in both crystal and fiber is between the β 6 valine on one HbS molecule and residues near the EF corner of an adjacent molecule. Models for the <b>helical</b> <b>double</b> strands were constructed by a geometric transformation from crystal to fiber that preserves this critical interaction, minimizes distortion, and makes the transformation as smooth as possible. From these models, the energy of association was calculated over the range of all possible helical twists of the double strands and all possible distances of the double strands from the fiber axis. The calculated association energies reflect the fact that the axial interactions decrease as the distance between the double strand and the fiber axis increases, because of the increased length of the helical path taken by the double strand. The lateral interactions between HbS molecules in a double strand change relatively little between the crystal and possible <b>helical</b> <b>double</b> strands. If the twist of the fiber or the distance between the double strand and the fiber axis is too great, the lateral interaction is broken by intermolecular contacts in the region around the β 6 valine. Consequently, the geometry of the β 6 valine interaction and the residues surrounding it severely restricts the possible helical twist, radius, and handedness of helical aggregates constructed from the double strands. The limitations defined by this analysis establish the structural basis for the right-handed twist observed in HbS fibers and demonstrates that for a subunit twist of 8 °, the fiber diameter cannot be more than ∼ 300 Å, consistent with electron microscope observations. The energy of interaction among HbS molecules in a double strand is very slowly varying with helical pitch, explaining the variable pitch observed in HbS fibers. The analysis results in a model for the HbS double strand, for use in the analysis of interactions between double strands and for refinement of models of the HbS fibers against x-ray diffraction data...|$|R
