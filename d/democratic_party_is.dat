25|$|The 50-state {{strategy}} {{relied on}} the idea that building the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> at once an incremental election by election process as well as a long-term vision in party building.

This trend is often similar for Hispanics or others strongly identifying with the Catholic Church, a religion that strongly opposes abortion and gay marriage.|$|E

25|$|In the 1970s, then-Apostle Ezra Taft Benson {{was quoted}} by the Associated Press {{that it would}} be {{difficult}} for a faithful Latter-day Saint to be a liberal Democrat. Although the LDS Church has officially repudiated such statements on many occasions, Democratic candidates—including LDS Democrats—believe that Republicans capitalize on the perception that the Republican Party is doctrinally superior. Political scientist and pollster Dan Jones explains this disparity by noting that the national <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> <b>is</b> associated with liberal positions on gay marriage and abortion, both of which the LDS Church is against. The Republican Party in heavily Mormon Utah County presents itself as the superior choice for Latter-day Saints. Even though Utah Democratic candidates are predominantly LDS, socially conservative, and pro-life, no Democrat has won in Utah County since 1994.|$|E

Gallup polling from May 2009 stated that 82% of Democrats support open enlistment.|$|E
