500|$|The {{ship was}} barque-rigged {{and had a}} sail area of [...] Her funnel was semi-retractable to reduce wind {{resistance}} while under sail alone. She was designed to allow the ship's propeller to be hoisted up into {{the stern of the}} ship to reduce drag while under sail, but the <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear</b> was never fitted.|$|E
60|$|<b>Hoisting</b> <b>gear</b> and rope {{had been}} {{prepared}} on the first day, in case it should be necessary to lower any one, for the wire rope had snapped when the attempt {{had been made to}} draw up the cage after the second explosion, and the sudden release from the strain had caused the engine to fly round, breaking some gear, and for the time disabling it from further work. A hundred and forty fathoms of rope, the depth of the shaft being a hundred and twenty, {{had been prepared}}, and was in readiness to be passed over a pulley suspended above the shaft. A lighted candle in a candlestick was placed on a sort of tray, which was fastened to the rope, and then it was lowered gradually down. Eagerly those above watched it as it descended--down--down, till it became a mere speck below. Then it suddenly disappeared.|$|E
50|$|The first Italian patent {{was awarded}} by the Republic of Florence in 1421. The Florentine {{architect}} Filippo Brunelleschi received a three-year patent for a barge with <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear,</b> that carried marble along the Arno River in 1421.|$|E

50|$|In the US the Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT) was {{produced}} in a version with a hooklift <b>hoist</b> <b>gear</b> named Load Handling System (LHS). The M1120 HEMTT LHS {{is the basis of}} the Palletized Load System using a flatbed platform to be mounted under ISO containers as a Container Handling Unit (CHU). This allows containers to be unloaded without the help of a forklift. Current NATO agreements require PLS to maintain interoperability with comparable British, German and French systems {{through the use of a}} common flatrack.|$|R
5000|$|There is an {{additional}} term [...] "hooklift container" [...] that {{is related to the}} common designation of the <b>hoist</b> <b>gear</b> on trucks used for roller containers to be called [...] "hook lift". This has influenced languages like Dutch where the truck is called haakarmvoertuig (hook arm vehicle) and the container being a haakarmbak (hook arm pod). These terms refer to the level arm that matches with the grip hook on the container to lift it from the ground. Note that the term hooklift container may refer to any container type with {{an additional}} hook bar which does not necessarily include roller wheels - this includes the NATO standard STANAG 2413 variations of 20' ISO containers having an additional hook bar.|$|R
50|$|The {{armoured}} frigates were barque-rigged {{and had a}} {{sail area}} of 24500 sq ft. Their funnel was semi-retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone. They was designed to allow their propeller to be hoisted up into {{the stern of the}} ship to reduce drag while under sail, but the <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear</b> was never fitted on either ship.|$|E
50|$|Such {{dramatic}} demonstrations {{convinced the}} Secretary of the Navy that destroyer-based scout planes had value, and on 27 May, he directed that six new destroyers of the soon-to-be-constructed Fletcher-class (DD 476-481) be fitted with catapults and handling equipment. Because of mechanical {{deficiencies in the}} <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear,</b> the program was cancelled early in 1943. The concept thus failed to mature as a combat technique, but the destroyer-observation seaplane team was to be revived under somewhat modified conditions during later amphibious operations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{other major}} {{place to find}} Machinist's Mates is in the {{auxiliaries}} division of engineering department, {{often referred to as}} [...] "A-gang". Mechanics in this role establish training & work on mechanical equipment within and outside of the engine rooms. To include the operation and preventive maintenance of: air conditioning and refrigeration units, liquid oxygen and nitrogen units, hydraulic lifting and <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear,</b> hydraulic power plant components and mechanisms, chilled and fresh water, atmosphere control, ventilation, emergency diesel and corresponding sub-systems, ballast control, auxiliary drain, compressed air and gases, plumbing, trash disposal & other equipment as designated by the Engineering Officer (Chief Engineer, or CHENG). Members of [...] "A-gang" [...] may also help Damage Controlman, Gunner's Mates, or other ratings. Some listed attributes apply to Submarine Warfare to include SUBSAFE requirements for work authorization. All systems listed apply to a minimum of valve, pump maintenance repair.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a modern}} {{airplane}} {{one can find}} numerous mechanical systems with gears, power drive units, drive shafts, actuators, hoists and other mechanical parts. People used to call helicopters [...] "flying transmissions". Today an average airplane has more transmission components than a helicopter. The common transmission mechanical components of an airplane are: high lift system, bay door actuation system, cargo door actuation system, landing <b>gears,</b> <b>hoists,</b> cargo door actuation systems and sometimes primary flight control system. The overall cost and weight of the mechanical system of an airplane can {{be similar to the}} cost and weight of the helicopter transmission. Reduction of weight and cost of mechanical systems is important for reduction of the overall operating cost of the airplane.|$|R
50|$|The place {{contains}} mine workings, {{a battery}} and concentration plant foundations arranged in close association. The main {{component of the}} place is an almost intact five head stamp battery set on rendered brick and stone mounts. Concrete foundations for the diesel power plant (which has been removed) are located alongside the stamp battery. Parts of another five head stamp battery are scattered to the south west of the battery area, however there are no foundations to indicate installation of a second stamper. A timbered shaft, partly caved at the surface, is situated 8 metres south of, and {{in line with the}} battery's mortar box. The former <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear</b> over this shaft comprises a light bush timber whip pole and metal pulley. The battery area contains bush timber uprights of varying lengths which formed supports for the battery shed roof, water tanks and belt wheel shafts. Southeast of the stamper are the remains of an elevated tank and tank stand. The stand's timber stumps remain in place, but the corrugated iron tank has fallen and lies between the stumps and an adjacent mineshaft. A mullock heap about 3 metres wide and 30 metres in length stretches in an east-west direction {{to the north of the}} stamper. A line of shallow, open stopes extends northward of the stamp battery from the north edge of the mullock heap.|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} {{concept of}} hoisting gears {{is characterized by}} the combination of a toothed belt with a new special planetary gear. Constructive optimization of the concept are testing under steady conditions. Testing in real operation with unsteady conditions allows to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the new concept and to compare with a regular standard <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear.</b> Theoretical models are developed to determine the special characteristics of the new gear. Finally the suitability of the new concept for other applications is discussed. (orig.)

40|$|The dynamic {{efficiency}} of hoisting transmission system {{on a container}} crane is fundamental for accurate efficiency prediction, while the dynamic {{efficiency of}} hoisting transmission system has not been investigated sufficiently. This paper will focus on dynamic efficiency of hoisting transmission system under hoisting dynamic load. A power loss model of gearbox was built. Then the dynamic model of gear transmission was developed including time-varying mesh stiffness and hoisting dynamic load was studied. Power loss, dynamic efficiency, and equivalent static efficiency were conducted in hoisting and lowering working conditions. The result shows that dynamic efficiency which consists of the significant lower frequency component coincided with hoisting load torque of the higher frequency component which {{is directly related to}} dynamic mesh and bearing force. And in two processes, the equivalent static efficiency in constant speed stage is min, whereas maximum value occurs in different stage. The research results lay a foundation for <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear</b> transmission dynamic efficiency analysis...|$|E
40|$|The triumphant {{raising of}} the Vatican obelisk, {{conducted}} by Domenico Fontana under Sixtus V between April and September 1586, had a knock-on {{effect in the}} building industry: it unleashed a process of innovation and development in building technology. The heir of Roman imperial mechanics, this technology would reach a level of efficiency and functionality between the sixteenth and eighteenth century not to be surpassed for a long time. It was favoured, on the one hand, by the new impulse registered in Roman building practice from the fifteenth century on and, on the other, by the renewed interest in mechanics, aimed at the invention of new and more functional apparatus for the building industry. But alongside these mechanical supports, a decisive role was also played {{by the development of}} a quite extraordinary organizational, managerial and technical apparatus that had its main organ of propulsion in the Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro, at once an experimental laboratory and an unrivalled reservoir of resources, both technical and professional. In this system, the sector of building machinery assumed a major role. It became an integral and indispensable part of architectural practice. This was not only thanks to the progress of the theory of machinatio, but above all thanks to the gradual advancement of the apparatus developed to support the building industry by technical experts in the field. The provisional apparatus, the machines and operational procedure developed by Fontana {{are an integral part of}} a wider operational programme, inspired by flexibility in the use of machines and equipment and their adaptation to the ordinary practice of building. The huge financial investment implied by such a programme was one that only the Fabbrica di San Pietro could afford. The investment, however, could be recouped by the hiring out of machinery to other Roman building sites. This practice continued and is still documented in the nineteenth century, for instance in the restoration of the portico of San Paolo fuori le Mura or in the raising of dedicatory columns and obelisks. The prolonged use of this building apparatus is proof of the traditional and pragmatic character that informed executive practice and building technology right down to the introduction of construction in reinforced concrete. Until then, wood, iron and rope would remain the main constituents not only of such basic building apparatus as winches, windlasses, capstans, scaffolding, trestles and derricks, but also of <b>hoisting</b> <b>gear</b> such as traglie and girelle (pulleys). Each modification or innovation could be tested, and finally adopted, only by use and direct practice. In this situation of marked traditionalism, the diffusion of technical know-how, almost exclusively of empirical and pragmatic character, remained in the hands of the master builders and sampietrini (maintenance men) of the Fabbrica di San Pietro, such as the unlettered expert (“homo sanza Lettere”) Nicola Zabaglia, or technical experts of various origin and training. The frequent consultations between experts, the technical advice sought from the most skilled building foremen (capomastri), and the fruitful exchange of craftsmen between various building sites in Rome, generated a spontaneous and immediate transmission of know-how in the technical and mechanical field. Only rarely did this know-how avail itself of the nascent science of mechanics, from which it long remained separated. To the precepts of theoretical mechanics it seemed to prefer the more reassuring precedent set by the well-tried building practices of antiquity and the Renaissance...|$|E
