40|$|The {{saprophytic}} fungus Ulocladium atrum {{was selected}} {{for its ability to}} competitively exclude Botrytis spp. from aboveground necrotic plant tissues which can {{play a crucial role in}} the epidemiology of diseases caused by necrotrophic Botrytis spp. Fungal growth in necrotic aboveground tissues can be hampered by fluctuating water availability. Adaptation to these adverse conditions is a key factor for the successful establishment of an antagonist population in this niche. Conidia of U. atrum germinated at water potentials between - 1 and - 7 MPa on water agar. Germinated conidia survived one to three <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> moist incubation by periods at - 10 or - 42 MPa. The speed of germination was significantly slower with <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the moist <b>period</b> as compared with the control, which had continuously moist incubation. However, the maximum germination percentage was the same for conidia incubated with or without <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the moist incubation. In bio-assays with necrotic cyclamen leaves at - 1, - 3, and - 7 MPa, U. atrum significantly reduced the sporulation of B. cinerea by more than 80 %. The results demonstrate that U. atrum tolerates water stress during competitive substrate colonization with B. cinerea. The antagonist is, therefore, an attractive candidate for field applications on aboveground tissues...|$|R
40|$|Two basic {{experiments}} {{defined a}} long-day inhibitory effect on Xanthium flowering: the basal {{half of a}} single leaf on long day inhibits response of the tip half to a short day; and a long-day leaf inhibits response of a short-day leaf, providing it is between the short-day leaf and a receptive bud (whether above or below the short-day leaf). Five hypotheses were explored with the conclusions that the tip half can synthesize florigen, and inhibition is not due to prevention of florigen synthesis, translocational effects, or a translocatable long-day inhibitor. Inhibition is localized and may be a condition of the leaf or a relatively immobile substance. Studies <b>of</b> critical dark <b>period,</b> light intensity, and <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> a dark <b>period</b> show that, when the leaf is not producing florigen, it is actively inhibitory. Immature leaves are more inhibitory than older leaves. The effect was found not to pass dead tissue, and iron-deficient tissue will cause inhibition, though it will not cause promotion...|$|R
40|$|Background: HIV {{infection}} per se and HAART {{can alter}} mitochondrial functionality, {{leading to a}} decrease in mitochondrial DNA content. Objective: To evaluate whether treatment interruption monitored by CD 4 cell count can restore mitochondrial DNA content in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Methods: Mitochondrial DNA content was measured in platelet-free CD 4 and CD 8 T cells by real-time polymerase chain reaction; flow cytometry was used to identify and quantify activated CD 4 and CD 8 T lymphocytes. Results: The 30 patients had been treated for a mean of 107 months (range, 27 - 197). Median CD 4 cell count at discontinuation was 702 cells/mu l (range, 547 - 798). Median observational time from HAART discontinuation was 11. 3 months (range, 4 - 26). Discontinuation of treatment provoked significant increases in mitochondrial DNA in CD 8 T cells, which started only 6 months after therapy cliscontinuation [5. 12 copies/ cell per month from 0 to 6 months (P = 0. 3 7) and 2 6. 96 copies/cel I per month from 6 to 12 months (P < 0. 0001) ]. Conclusions: This study is the first showing that mitochondrial DNA content can increase in peripheral blood lymphocytes during treatment interruption, but only after at least 6 months <b>of</b> <b>interruption.</b> Consequently, <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> shorter <b>periods,</b> whether by clinician or patient decision, are unlikely to allow restoration of mitochondrial DNA and so decrease HAART-related toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Various {{bacterial}} spores {{exhibited a}} wide range of radiation resistance to doses of 0. 25 to 2. 5 Mrad from a cobalt- 60 radiation facility. Bacillus pumilus and Clos-tridium tetani were shown to have the highest degree of resistance when compared with other bacterial sporeformers. B. subtilis E 163 was the least resistant of the bacterial spores studied. Dried spores contained on cellulose discs were more readily destroyed by γ-rays than were wet spores under similar conditions. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was destroyed by radiation doses much lower than that required by the least resistant bacterial spores. Interrupted dosimetry tests performed with materials of various types showed that sutures and other similar materials were effectively sterilized when the total radiation dose was given in two separate exposures with <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> 1 to 19 days. When “agar dosimeters” were employed in similar interrupted dosimetry series, B. pumilus spores were recovered in a few tests after administration of a total combined dosage of 2. 5 Mrad with <b>interruption</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> 2 to 19 days.

30|$|In [29], a new {{negotiation}} strategy {{which is}} named as ConTask is proposed for grid resource allocation. According to [29]:“The ConTask allows a client to concede beyond the last best proposal {{of the grid}} resource allocator or its own proposal in order to start the subsequent interruption period under favorable conditions for negotiation (i.e., closer to the maximum of resource availability)”. By introducing this new negotiation strategy not only the length <b>of</b> <b>interruption</b> <b>periods</b> is reduced but also the length <b>of</b> execution <b>periods</b> is increased. Also, the ConTask tries to not sacrifice the utilities of the clients (but not improve them). This paper focuses on only the client side {{of the market and}} applying encouraging strategy by the grid resource allocator in unfavorable conditions is ignored.|$|R
40|$|The semidian (∼ 12 h) {{periodicity}} in {{the effect}} <b>of</b> far-red (FR) <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> the light <b>period</b> preceding inductive darkness on flowering in Pharbitis nil {{appears to be}} mediated by phytochrome: (a) promotion by interruptions 2 hours before inductive darkness (− 2 hours) and inhibition at − 8 hours are greater the higher the proportion of FR/R+FR during the interruption; (b) brief FR exposures followed by darkness are even more effective than FR throughout; (c) the effect of brief FR is reversed by subsequent R; (d) R <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> an FR background are most promotive at − 8 hours, when FR is most inhibitory. Promotive FR interruptions at − 2 or − 14 hours shorten the critical dark period whereas inhibitory FR interruptions at − 8 hours lengthen it. We conclude that the semidian rhythm is controlled by a `timing pool' of phytochrome FR absorbing form (Pfr) which disappears rapidly in darkness: four different estimates from our experiments indicate that Pfr was reduced to the level set by FR within 20 to 45 minutes in darkness. However, flowering may also be influenced by a `metabolic pool' of Pfr with a delayed loss in darkness, the time {{of which can be}} advanced or retarded by shifting the semidian rhythm...|$|R
40|$|Conidia of Alternaria linicola germinated on both water agar and linseed leaves (detached or attached) over a {{wide range}} of {{temperatures}} (5 - 25 degrees C) by producing one to several germ tubes. At temperatures between 10 degrees C and 25 degrees C and under continuous wetness in darkness, germination started within 2 h after inoculation and reached a maximum (100 %) by 8 to 24 h, depending on temperature. At 5 degrees C, the onset of germination was later and the rate of germ tube elongation was slower than that at 10 - 25 degrees C. During germination, conidia of A. linicola were sensitive to dry <b>interruptions</b> <b>of</b> wet <b>periods</b> and to light. Short (2 h) or long (12 h) dry interruptions occurring at any time between 2 and 6 h after inoculation stopped conidial germination and germ tube elongation. With continuous wetness, light periods 2 to 12 h long immediately after inoculation inhibited conidial germination, which was resumed only when a dark period followed subsequently. However, germination and germ tube elongation of A. linicola conidia stopped and the viability of the conidia was lost during exposure to dry light periods immediately after inoculation with spore suspensions. Penetration of leaves by A. linicola was evident after 12 h and occurred mainly through epidermal cells (direct) with or without the formation of appressoria...|$|R
40|$|The {{persistent}} {{deficits in}} social communication and social interactions {{of individuals with}} high-functioning autism (HFA) may impair their cooperative behaviors. This study investigated the relationship between social and non-social deficits in children with HFA and the cooperative behaviors of such children. Theory of mind (ToM), executive function, and central coherence of children with HFA and typically developing (TD) children, aged 6 - 12 years, were investigated, {{and the effects of}} these social and non-social deficits on children&# 39;s cooperativeness were examined. The classical prisoner&# 39;s dilemma game (PDG) and cooperative implemental tasks were used to assess children&# 39;s cooperativeness. ToM was measured using a series of classical false belief tasks and the face test. The Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST) and the Embedded Figures Test (EFT) were administered to assess executive function and central coherence, respectively. The results showed that {{there was no significant difference}} in cooperation in PDG between HFA and TD children, while cooperation in children with HFA in the <b>interruption</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> the implemental tasks was significantly lower than that of TD children. Children with HFA had social deficits and had more poorly developed ToM than TD children, and executive function in children with HFA was poorer than that in TD children. Different types of deficits were predictive of HFA children&# 39;s degree of cooperation on different tasks: the social perceptual component of ToM and executive function predicted children&# 39;s cooperativeness in the PDC, and executive function predicted HFA children&# 39;s cooperativeness during the <b>interruption</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> an implemental task. By contrast, central coherence did not predict either of the two types of cooperation. It might indicate that the two different types of cooperative tasks may require different mental abilities.

30|$|Based on {{data of the}} NEPS’s adult cohort, {{we looked}} at the <b>interruption</b> <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> women who had their first child between 1992 and 2010. To {{describe}} the occupational context, we supplemented the individual level data with occupational characteristics drawn from the SIAB and the Microcensus. Kaplan-Meier estimates show descriptively that the probability to return differs depending on the sex composition in the pre-interruption occupation. Accordingly, women from occupations dominated by women returned to the labour market more slowly than women who had been working in a male-dominated occupation before the break. Our multivariate results show, however, that this effect is not due to the proportion of women itself but to the low wage level in occupations with a high percentage of women. In contrast, the impact of the part-time rate is not significant.|$|R

In continuous darkness, the floral parameters a (vegetative growth rate), (flowering ratio), Pi (pre-flower induction period) and P 4 (flower production period) in diluted media {{were similar to those}} in 1 / 2 HIS medium. However, P 2 (flower in-duction period) was greatly extended by the dilution of the medium up to 1 / 10 strength and was gradually shortened by further dilution up to 1 / 80 strength. Pi and P 2 in 1 / 4 HIS medium were extended by 1. 0 and 2. 5 days, respectively, by the <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the dark <b>period</b> with 5 -min red light at the 7 th h.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To {{systematically}} {{review the}} {{used to define}} running-related musculoskeletal injury and to analyze the implications of different definitions {{on the results of}} studies. BACKGROUND: Studies have developed their own definitions of running-related musculoskeletal injuries based on different criteria. This may affect the rates of injury, which can be overestimated or underestimated {{due to the lack of}} a standard definition. METHODS: Searches were conducted in the Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, LILACS, and SciELO databases, without limits on date of publication and language. Only articles that reported a definition of running-related injury were included. The definitions were classified according to 3 domains and subcategories: (1) presence of physical complaint (symptom, body system involved, region), (2) <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> training or competition (primary sports involved, extent of injury, extent <b>of</b> limitation, <b>interruption,</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> injury), and (3) need for medical assistance. Spearman rank correlation was performed to evaluate the correlation between the completeness of definitions and the rates of injury reported in the studies. RESULTS: A total of 48 articles were included. Most studies described more than half of the subcategories, but with no standardization between the terms used within each category, showing that there is no consensus for a definition. The injury rates ranged between 3 % and 85 %, and tended to increase with less specific definitions. CONCLUSION: The commonly used by researchers to define a running-related injury vary between studies and may affect the rates of injuries. The lack of a standardized definition hinders comparison between studies and rates of injuries. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

40|$|Artificial {{inoculation}} {{studies with}} Diplodia pinea (Desm.) Kickx in the glass-house and growth cabinet established that initiation of infection (as {{indicated by the}} first appearance of stem symptoms) of Pinus radiata D. Don requires a minimum shoot wetness duration of 3 h {{but no more than}} 48 h within the temperature range 10 °- 30 °C. Duration of wetness seems important to infection as <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the wetness <b>period</b> by a dry <b>period</b> <b>of</b> 12 h or longer reduced the disease level. Temperature requirements for the initiation of infection and the subsequent development of the disease are not the same. Infection cannot be initiated at 5 °C, but at 10 °C the level of infection can be high if wetness is not a limiting factor. However, at this temperature lesion extension is limited and dead tops do not develop, even if the temperature is subsequently raised to the optimum. On the other hand, when infection is initiated at a high temperature, e. g., 25 °- 30 °C, lesion extension continues until {{a large part of the}} shoot is killed even at a subsequent temperature as low as 10 °C. Thus, temperature and duration of wetness during the early stages of infection largely determine the ultimate level of disease. Briefly, temperatures of 10 °- 12 °C, 15 °C, and 20 °- 25 °C or higher during 1 - 2 wet or humid days would represent respectively, light, moderate, and serious dead top development...|$|R

[3 H]Cholesteryl oleate-labelled human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was injected intravenously in rats with (1) chronically (8 days) interrupted EHC, (2) interrupted EHC {{at the time of}} LDL injection and (3) intact EHC. During the first 3 h after <b>interruption</b> <b>of</b> the EHC, bile flow decreased to 50 % and biliary bile acid, phospholipid and cholesterol secretion to 5 %, 11 % and 19 % of their initial values respectively. After 8 days of bile diversion, biliary cholesterol output and bile flow were at that same level, but bile acid output was increased 2 - 3 -fold and phospholipid output was about 2 times lower.
