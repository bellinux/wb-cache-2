25|$|Morphine was {{the most}} {{commonly}} abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of dihydromorphine (ca. 1900), the <b>dihydromorphinone</b> class of opioids (1920s), and oxycodone (1916) and similar drugs, {{there were no other}} drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away (pethidine was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as dihydrocodeine (Paracodin), ethylmorphine (Dionine), and benzylmorphine (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause hydromorphone, oxymorphone, high-dose oxycodone, or methadone as well as dextromoramide in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of dihydrocodeine, poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, propoxyphene, and tramadol.|$|E
50|$|Acetylmorphone (<b>Dihydromorphinone</b> acetate) is an opiate {{analogue}} {{that is an}} acetylated {{derivative of}} hydromorphone which {{was developed in the}} early 1900s as a potential cough suppressant and analgesic. It is prepared by the acetylation of hydromorphone using either acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. It was banned internationally in 1930 by the Health Committee of the League of Nations, in order to prevent its sale as an analogue of heroin.|$|E
5000|$|... 3,14-Diacetyloxymorphone is an opioid {{analgesic}} {{which has never}} been marketed. It is an acetyl derivative of oxymorphone. It is related to other acetylated morphone derivatives, including 3,6-diacetyloxymorphone, 3,8,14-triacetyloxymorphone, 3,6,8,14-tetraacetyloxymorphone, noroxymorphone analogs of {{all or most of}} the above, and 3,6,14-triacetyloxymorphone, a derivative of oxymorphone whose structure-activity relationship suggests is 800% the potency of the parent drug versus 250% for 3,14-diacetyoxymorphone. [...] Both were developed in Austria in the 1920s along with other derivatives of the strong <b>dihydromorphinones</b> and these drugs are generated by reacting oxymorphone with either acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride at various temperatures in the 80-160 °C for several hours; 3,6,14-triacetyloxymorphone may be more easily made when a catalylst is used but elevated pressure or reaction in vacuo or under a nitrogen or noble gas atmosphere is not required. Each of the acetyl esters of oxymorphone has a hydromorphone analogue, and these were all developed around the same time (1915-1930) in Austria and Germany.|$|R
50|$|Thebacon is an opioid agonist {{narcotic}} analgesic of {{the middle}} range and a strong antitussive, primarily used in Europe, although {{it is no longer}} in common use. Currently, dihydrocodeine and nicocodeine are used as second-line codeine replacements. Thebacon was invented in Germany in 1924, four years after the first synthesis of hydrocodone. The other <b>dihydromorphinone</b> used as an antitussive is hydromorphone (Dilaudid cough syrup); the other narcotic antitussives are either more directly related to codeine or not related at all (open chain methadone relatives and thiambutenes).|$|E

50|$|Hydromorphone, {{also known}} as <b>dihydromorphinone,</b> and sold under the brand name Dilaudid among others, is a {{centrally}} acting pain medication of the opioid class. It is made from morphine. Comparatively, hydromorphone is to morphine as hydrocodone is to codeine - it is a hydrogenated ketone thereof. In medical terms, it is an opioid analgesic and, in legal terms, a narcotic. Hydromorphone is commonly used in the hospital setting, mostly intravenously (IV) because its bioavailability is very low orally, rectally, and intranasally. Sublingual administration (under the tongue) is usually superior to swallowing for bioavailability and effects; however, hydromorphone is bitter and hydrophilic like most opiates, not lipophilic, so it is absorbed poorly and slowly through mouth membranes.|$|E
50|$|Thebacon's {{analgesic}} and antitussive potency {{is slightly}} {{higher than that of}} its parent compound hydrocodone, which gives it approximately eight times the milligramme strength of codeine. The acetylation at position 3 and the conversion into a <b>dihydromorphinone</b> class semisynthetic (at position 14 on the morphine carbon skeleton) allows for the drug to more rapidly enter the central nervous system in greater quantity where it is de-acetylated into hydromorphone, and also converted by other processes into hydromorphinol, morphine and various other active and inactive substances; it therefore simultaneously takes advantage of two methods of increasing the effectiveness of morphine and its derivatives, those being catalytic hydrogenation (codeine into hydrocodone) and esterification (morphine into diamorphine, nicomorphine &c) in a manner not unlike to that of dihydrodiacetylmorphine.|$|E

40|$|Techniques {{based on}} thin-layer {{chromatography}} were applied qualitatively {{in an investigation}} into the metabolism of morphine in rats. The isolation of <b>dihydromorphinone</b> as a new metabolite of morphine is reported. The N-demethylation of morphine to normorphine was additionally confirmed during these investigations using several thin-layer chromatographic systems. The chromatographic method described was also applied to estimate the amounts of morphine and normorphine being excreted by rats treated with morphine...|$|E
40|$|Morphine {{depresses}} the twitch and tetanus of stimulated guinea-pig ileum {{by reducing}} acetylcholine released from cholinergic nerve endings. Acetylcholine output per shock falls to {{roughly the same}} residual amount at varying stimulation rates. Since normal output per shock declines with increasing stimulus frequency, the proportionate effect of morphine diminishes as stimulus frequency rises. Acute “tolerance” to morphine and a state of “morphinedependence” can be produced. Phenadoxone, <b>dihydromorphinone,</b> metopon, methadone, and heroin are more active, codeine and pethidine less active, than morphine. Nalorphine also depresses the twitch and can desensitize the gut both to itself and to morphine...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxidation}} {{of morphine}} by washed-cell incubations of Pseudomonas putida M 10 {{gave rise to}} a large number of transformation products including hydromorphone (<b>dihydromorphinone),</b> 14 beta-hydroxymorphine, 14 beta-hydroxymorphinone, and dihydromorphine. Similarly, in incubations with oxymorphone (14 beta-hydroxydihydromorphinone) as substrate, the major transformation product was identified as oxymorphol (14 beta-hydroxydihydromorphine). The identities of all these biological products were confirmed by mass spectrometry and 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. This is the first report describing structural evidence for the biological synthesis of 14 beta-hydroxymorphine and 14 beta-hydroxymorphinone. These products have applications as intermediates in the synthesis of semisynthetic opiate drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphine}} alkaloid hydromorphone (<b>dihydromorphinone)</b> {{was identified}} as an intermediary metabolite in the degradation of morphine by Pseudomonas putida M 10. A constitutive NADH-dependent morphinone reductase capable of catalyzing {{the reduction of the}} 7, 8 -unsaturated bond of morphinone and codeinone, yielding hydromorphone and hydrocodone, respectively, was shown to be present in cell extracts. The structures have been identified by 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. Morphinone reductase has been partially purified by anion-exchange and gel filtration chromatography. This enzyme has potential applications as a biocatalyst for the synthesis of the highly potent analgesic hydromorphone and the antitussive hydrocodone...|$|E
40|$|Being a {{disabling}} {{symptom of}} many medical conditions, effective pain control {{is one of}} the most important therapeutic priorities. Morphine and other opioid drugs produce analgesia primarily through μ opioid (MOP) receptors, which mediate beneficial but also the non-beneficial actions. Appropriate identification of novel opioid analgesics may reduce complications and improve patient compliance. It was reported that hydrazones, oximes, carbazones and semicarbazone derivatives of morphinan- 6 -ones, e. g. <b>dihydromorphinone</b> or oxymorphone, exhibit high affinity at the MOP receptor [1]. Since most of these structures show high antinociceptive potency while having less pronounced side effects, it remains a promising task to convert the carbonyl group of morphinan- 6 -ones into various functionalities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of the replacement of the 6 -keto function with a 6 -cyano group on in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profiles...|$|E
40|$|Dilaudid (<b>dihydromorphinone</b> hydrochloride) has {{attained}} rather {{widespread use}} {{as a substitute for}} morphine since the first brief reports describing its pharmacologic and clinical use appeared in 1926 (1) (2). Reviews of the clinical and pharma-cologic literature have been published by Eddy (3) and by King, Himmeisbach, and Sanders (4). Clinical papers have been quite numerous, but pharmacologic studies rather scanty. In view of the controversial reports in clinical literature, the determination of the addiction and tolerance producing prop-erties of dilaudid in comparison with morphine in experimental animals is especially important. Under the direction of Dr. Torald Sollmann, such a study was therefore made on the rat by the simple, objective, and roughly quantitative method previously used with morphine, heroine, and codeine. As a preliminary to this, the tranquilizing potency and respiratory depressant effects of dilaudid were determined in order to supply a sedative dose unit for comparison with other narcotics.

40|$|A {{bacterial}} strain {{belonging to the}} genus Bacillus isolated by enrichment culture technique using morphine as a sole source of carbon transforms morphine and codeine into 14 -hydroxymorphinone and 14 -hydroxycodeinone as major and 14 -hydroxymorphine and 14 -hydroxycodeine as minor metabolites, respectively. When the N-methyl group in morphine and codeine are replaced by higher alkyl groups, the organism still retains its ability to carry out 14 -hydroxylation as well as oxidation of the C- 6 -hydroxyl group in these N-variants, although the level of metabolites formed are considerably low. The organism readily transforms dihydromorphine and dihydrocodeine into only <b>dihydromorphinone</b> and dihydrocodeinone, respectively; suggesting that the 7, 8 -double bond is a necessary structural feature to carry out 14 -hydroxylation reaction. The cell free extract (20, 000 x g supernatant), prepared from morphine grown cells, transforms morphine into 14 -hydroxymorphinone {{in the presence of}} NAD(+), but fails to show activity against testosterone. However, the cell free extract prepared from testosterone grown cells contains significant levels of 17 beta- hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase but shows no activity against morphine...|$|E
40|$|SummaryBackground and objectiveA {{substantial}} number of patients report pain after graft harvest from the anterior iliac crest. This study examined the efficacy of local application of bupivacaine soaked in a Gelfoam® at the bone donor site in controlling postoperative pain and parenteral opioid use. MethodWe performed a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study comparing intraoperative infiltration of 20 mililiters of bupivacaine (treatment, group B) versus saline (placebo), with Gelfoam® soaked into the iliac crest harvest site for patients undergoing elective cervical spinal surgery. Postoperative administration of <b>dihydromorphinone</b> hydrochloride (post anesthesia care unit and patient-controlled analgesia) was standardized. A pain score based on a 10 -point visual analog scale (VAS). {{was used to assess}} the severity of pain associated with donor site. Pain scores and narcotic use/frequency were recorded at the twenty-four and forty-eighth hour after the operation. Physicians, patients, nursing staff, and statisticians were blinded to the treatment. ResultsThe groups were similar in baseline age, gender, and comorbidities. There {{was no significant difference between}} groups in VAS scores. Narcotic dosage, were significantly less in the Group B at 24 and 48 hours (p< 0. 05).
