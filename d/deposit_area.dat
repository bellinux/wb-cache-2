The station was listed as Green-Port on the 1852 timetable. On July 4, 1870, it was burned as part of Town festivities, and was rebuilt in October later that year. Another station was built in its place in 1892 (although some sources claim it was in 1894), with a distinguished ticket office bay window that was removed in the 1920s. A train shed also existed behind the roundtable, which {{was replaced by a}} coal <b>deposit</b> <b>area.</b> Steam service existed until June 5, 1955, mail was carried at the station until 1965, and the train ran onto a dock until 1978. A ticket booth with a station agent closed at Greenport on October 1, 1967. The station, its freight house, and roundtable were placed on the National Register of Historic Places as a national historic district on July 20, 1989. A high-level island platform leading to the old station and the Shelter Island Ferry was built between 1999 and 2000, as the case was with many other railroad stations on Long Island. The former freight house serves as the east end of the Railroad Museum of Long Island, while the old station is now the East End Seaport Museum.|$|E
