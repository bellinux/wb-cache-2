40|$|Nowadays, the {{inspection}} process {{is an essential}} part of the manufacturing process, where a product is subjected to verification of the geometric features, dimensions and tolerance specifications with respect to the product design specifications. One of the most interesting topics in the automation of {{the inspection}} process is the right fixture design. In the fixture design process we have used the information provided by the part design and manufacturing process. However, the lack of integration and structuring of this information results in one of the most important problems, producing an increase in the time and cost implied in the development of the fixture design and its implementation. For this reason, this work presents a knowledge model for the <b>inspection</b> <b>fixture</b> design process for a Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM), which allows the automation of the <b>inspection</b> <b>fixture</b> design process to be made easier, reducing time and cost associated to the inspection process and to the manufacturing process in general...|$|E
40|$|Critical {{technology}} {{experiments have}} been performed on thermal energy storage modules {{in support of the}} NASA Advanced Solar Dynamic Brayton Heat Receiver Program. The modules, wedge-shaped canisters containing lithium fluoride (LiF), were designed to minimize the mechanical stresses that occur during the phase change of the LiF. Nickel foam inserts were placed in two of the test canisters to provide thermal conductivity enhancement and to distribute the void volume throughout the canister. A procedure was developed for reducing the nickel oxides on the nickel foam to enhance the wicking ability of the foam. The canisters were filled with LiF and closure-welded at the NASA Lewis Research Center. Two canisters, one with a nickel foam insert, the other without an insert, were thermally cycled in various orientations in a fluidized bed furnace. Computer-aided tomography was successfully used to nondestructively determine void locations in the canisters. Finally, canister dimensional stability was measured after thermal cycling with an <b>inspection</b> <b>fixture...</b>|$|E
40|$|Critical {{technology}} {{experiments have}} been performed on thermal energy storage modules {{in support of the}} Brayton Advanced Heat Receiver program. The modules are wedge-shaped canisters designed to minimize the mechanical stresses that occur during the phase change of the lithium fluoride phase change material. Nickel foam inserts were used in some of the canisters to provide thermal conductivity enhancement and to distribute the void volume. Two canisters, one with a nickel foam insert, and one without, were thermally cycled in various orientations in a fluidized bed furnace. The only measurable impact of the nickel foam was seen when the back and short sides of the canister were insulated to simulate operation in the advanced receiver design. In tests with insulation, the furnace to back side delta T was larger in the canister with the nickel foam insert, probably due to the radiant absorptivity of the nickel. However, the differences in the temperature profiles of the two canisters were small, and in many cases the profiles matched fairly well. Computed Tomography (CT) was successfully used to nondestructively demarcate void locations in the canisters. Finally, canister dimensional stability, which was measured throughout the thermal cycling test program with an <b>inspection</b> <b>fixture</b> was satisfactory with a maximum change of 0. 635 mm (0. 025 in.) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{geometric}} {{measurement of}} parts using a {{coordinate measuring machine}} (CMM) has been generally adapted to the advanced automotive and aerospace industries. However, for the geometric inspection of deformable free-form parts, special <b>inspection</b> <b>fixtures,</b> in combination with CMM’s and/or optical data acquisition devices (scanners), are used. As a result, the geometric inspection of flexible parts is a consuming process {{in terms of time}} and money. The general procedure to eliminate the use of <b>inspection</b> <b>fixtures</b> based on distance preserving nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) technique was developed in our previous works. We sought out geometric properties that are invariant to inelastic deformations. In this paper we will only present a systematic comparison of some well-known dimensionality reduction techniques in order to evaluate their accuracy and potential for non-rigid metrology. We will demonstrate that even though these techniques may provide acceptable results through artificial data on certain fields like pattern recognition and machine learning, this performance cannot be extended to all real engineering metrology problems where high accuracy is needed...|$|R

These tests may involve custom <b>inspection</b> <b>fixtures,</b> statistical sampling methods, and other techniques appropriate for ongoing production of a large quantity of the final product. Prototypes are generally made with much closer individual inspection and the assumption that some adjustment or rework {{will be part of the}} fabrication process. Prototypes may also be exempted from some requirements that will apply to the final product.|$|R
40|$|Free-form nonrigid parts {{form the}} {{substance}} of today’s automotive and aerospace industries. These parts have different shapes in free state due to their dimensional and geometric variations, gravity and residual strains. For the geometric inspection of such compliant parts, special inspection fixtures, in combination with coordinate measuring systems (CMM) and/or optical data acquisition devices (scanners) are used. This inevitably causes additional costs and delays that result in a lack of competitiveness in the industry. The goal of this thesis is to facilitate the dimensional and geometrical inspection of flexible components from a point cloud without using a jig or secondary conformation operation. More specifically, we aim to develop a methodology to localize and quantify the profile defects {{in the case of}} thin shells which are typical to the aerospace and automotive industries. The presented methodology is {{based on the fact that}} the interpoint geodesic distance between any two points of a shape remains unchangeable during an isometric deformation. This study elaborates on the theory and general methods for the metrology of nonrigid parts. We have developed a Generalized Numerical <b>Inspection</b> <b>Fixture</b> (GNIF), a robust methodology which merges existing technologies in metric and computational geometry, nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, and finite element methods to introduce a general approach to the fixtureless geometrical inspection of nonrigid parts...|$|E
40|$|The {{tolerancing}} {{of mechanical}} parts {{is one of}} the major problems in mode mindustry. It's economic consequences are important to the manufacturing sector which sustains major transformations imposed by market globalization and technology evolution (CAD, CMM, 3 D Scanners, etc.). Today, we know that product performance optimization requires a consideration of the inherent variations in manufacturing processes, hence quality control throughout the development process and manufacturing. Currently, the geometric inspection oiflexible (or nonrigid) mechanical parts, such as thin-walled skins of airplane or car bodies is still limited to the use of relatively expensive special <b>inspection</b> <b>fixtures,</b> which simulate the use state, applying the same constraints that reflect assembly information. Subsequently, contact measuring or scanning is performed. Simulating this use state means that, deformation effects due to flexibility are eliminated. In this way, defects in the manufacturing process are detectable. The goal of this thesis is to facilitate the dimensional and geometrical inspection of flexible components from a point cloud without using a jig or secondary conformation operation. More specifically, we aim to develop a methodology to localize and quantify the profile defects in the case of thin shells which are typical to the aerospace and automotive industries. To this end, we implemented an idea that we call Numerical <b>Inspection</b> <b>Fixtures.</b> We use geodesic distances to detect the intrinsic similarities between a part in a free state which includes the effects of gravity, intemal constraints and manufacturing defects, and the same part as nominally defined by a CAD model. This thesis develops the theoretical foundation of the proposed methods and related algorithms. We used an approach already used in medical image processing to identify minimum geodesic distance and statistics (Multidimensional Scaling) to analyze the similarities and dissimilarities between two objects, as well as the finite element method to reach a general approach for the inspection of nonrigid parts. Two methods are proposed with numerical validations...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{control is}} an {{important}} factor for manufacturing companies looking to prosper in an era of globalization, market pressures and technological advances. Functionality and product quality cannot be guaranteed without this important aspect. Manufactured parts have deviations from their nominal (CAD) shape caused by the manufacturing process. Thus, geometric inspection is a very important element in the quality control of mechanical parts. We will focus here on the geometric inspection of non-rigid (flexible) parts which are widely used in the aeronautic and automotive industries. Non-rigid parts can have different forms in a free-state condition compared with their nominal models due to residual stress and gravity loads. To solve this problem, dedicated <b>inspection</b> <b>fixtures</b> are generally used in industry to compensate for the displacement of such parts for simulating the use state in order to perform geometric <b>inspections.</b> These <b>fixtures</b> and the installation and inspection processes are expensive and time-consuming. Our aim in this thesis is therefore to develop an inspection method which eliminates the need for specialized fixtures. This is done by acquiring a point cloud from the part in a free-state condition using a contactless measuring device such as optical scanning and comparing it with the CAD model for the deviation identification. Using a non-rigid registration method and finite element analysis, we numerically inspect the profile of a non-rigid part. To do so, a simulated displacement is performed using an improved definition of displacement boundary conditions for simulating unfixed parts. In addition, we propose a numerical method for dimensional metrology of non-rigid parts in a free-state condition based on the arc length measurement by calculating the geodesic distance using the Fast Marching Method (FMM). In this thesis, we apply our developed methods on industrial non-rigid parts with free-form surfaces simulated with different types of displacement, defect, and measurement noise in order to evaluate the metrological performance of the developed methods...|$|R
40|$|International audienceh i g h l i g h t s • The virtual fixture method {{allows for}} the {{inspection}} of nonrigid parts. • It does not necessitate the pre-processing of the point cloud into a FE mesh. • It {{takes into account the}} part's specification limiting the restraining forces. • It infers the part's structural behavior from the FE model of the nominal CAD. • Two case studies on physical parts are performed. a b s t r a c t Virtually mounting nonrigid parts onto their fixture is proposed by researchers to remove the need for the use of complex physical <b>inspection</b> <b>fixtures</b> during the measurement process. Current approaches necessitate the pre-processing of the free-state nonrigid part's point cloud into a suitable finite element (FE) mesh and are limited by the use of the boundary conditions setting methods available in FE software. In addition to these limits, these approaches do {{not take into account the}} forces used to restrain the part during the inspection, as commonly mandated for aerospace panels. To address these shortcomings, this paper presents a virtual fixture method that predicts the fixed shape of the part without the aforementioned drawbacks of current approaches. This is achieved by embedding information retrieved from a FE analysis of the nominal CAD model into a boundary displacement constrained optimization. To evaluate the proposed method, two case studies on physical parts are performed using the proposed virtual fixture method to evaluate the profile and assembly force specifications of each part...|$|R
40|$|Inspection is an {{important}} stage in the manufacturing process of machined parts. Coordinate measuring machines (CMM) have become more automatic, programmable, and capable of fulfilling the growing demands of <b>inspection.</b> However, <b>fixturing</b> (datum alignment) of parts is still done manually, consuming valuable inspection time. In this paper, we describe an automated datum alignment technique which integrates a vision system with the CMM to avoid part fixturing. The rough position of the part is estimated through image analysis. This initial reference frame drives the CMM through an automatic datum alignment procedure, thereby automatically establishing the reference frame {{without the use of}} fixtures. This technique has been demonstrated {{for two and a half}} dimensional (2. 5 D) machined parts with well-defined features that exhibit a stable position on a flat table...|$|R
30|$|Despite the {{prosthetic}} {{aspects of the}} proposed technique are somewhat beyond the paper scope, some considerations appear obliged. Screw-retained, metal-core dental prostheses are popular, manageable devices allowing easy removal for <b>fixture</b> <b>inspection</b> and cleaning. An interesting point is that in patient no. 1, the interdental and inter-arch obligations lead to a double-cantilevered dental restoration, entailing a possible overload: to mitigate it prudently, mesial (to 23) and distal (to 27) splinting were conceived. Indeed, implant stability was preserved, as checked at regular clinical and X-ray follow-up examinations (Fig.  5).|$|R

To further enhance ergonomics, reduce personnel/flight hardware risks, and improve repeatability, an <b>inspection</b> cart and <b>fixture</b> were constructed to physically secure the instruments for Inspectors during 652 inspection points per flow.

40|$|Modular {{fixturing}} kits {{are precisely}} machined sets of components used for flexible, short-turnaround construction of fixtures {{for a variety}} of manufacturing purposes. A modular vise is a parallel-jaw vise, where each jaw is a modular fixture plate with a regular grid of precisely positioned holes. A modular vise can be used to locate and hold parts for machining, assembly, and <b>inspection</b> tasks. To <b>fixture</b> a part, one places pins in some of the holes so that when the vise is closed, the part is reliably located and completely constrained. The modular vise concept can be adapted easily to the design of modular parallel-jaw grippers for robots. By attaching a grid plate to each jaw of a parallel-jaw gripper, the authors gain the ability to easily construct high-quality grasps {{for a wide variety of}} parts from a standard set of hardware. Wallack and Canny developed a previous algorithm for planning planar grasp configurations for the modular vise. In this paper, the authors expand this work to produce a 3 -d fixture/gripper design tool. They describe several analyses added to the planar algorithm to improve its utility, including a three-dimensional grasp quality metric based on geometric and force information, three-dimensional geometric loading analysis, and inter-gripper interference analysis to determine the compatibility of multiple grasps for handing the part from one gripper to another. Finally, the authors describe two applications which combine the utility of modular vise-style grasping with inter-gripper interference: The first is the design of a flexible part-handling subsystem for a part cleaning workcell under development at Sandia National Laboratories; the second is the automatic design of grippers that support the assembly of multiple products on a single assembly line...|$|R
