5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be <b>free</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of the B cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of the B cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E

5|$|Habermas {{argues that}} his ethical theory is an {{improvement}} on Kant's ethics. He rejects the dualistic framework of Kant's ethics. Kant distinguished between the phenomena world, {{which can be}} sensed and experienced by humans, and the noumena, or spiritual world, which is inaccessible to humans. This dichotomy was necessary for Kant because it could explain the autonomy of a human agent: although a human is bound in the phenomenal world, their actions are <b>free</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intelligible world. For Habermas, morality arises from discourse, which is made necessary by their rationality and needs, rather than their freedom.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Malawi's Ministry of Health and Population began {{developing}} {{a plan to}} distribute antiretroviral drugs to the population, and, as of 2003, there were several sites providing antiretroviral drugs in Malawi. The Lighthouse, a trust in Lilongwe that fights HIV/AIDS, provides antiretroviral drugs {{at a cost of}} 2,500 kwacha per month. Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital in Blantyre provides antiretroviral therapy through its outpatient department, and Médecins Sans Frontières distributes antiretroviral drugs to patients for <b>free</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chiradzulu and Thyolo Districts. Many different private providers sell antiretroviral drugs, particularly in cities; however, very few patients can afford to receive drugs from the private sector in Malawi. In addition, private providers are not currently required to obtain certification before selling antiretroviral drugs, and, therefore, this practice is not closely monitored. Finally, some employees receive access to antiretroviral drugs through the health insurance policies provided by their employers, but this practice is not widespread.|$|E
5|$|In Jersey, the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, in {{partnership}} with the States of Jersey and the National Trust for Jersey began a project in 2010, aimed at restoring selected areas of Jersey's coastline with the intention of returning those birds that had become locally extinct. The red-billed chough was chosen as a flagship species for this project, having been absent from Jersey since around 1900. Durrell initially received two pairs of choughs from Paradise Park in Cornwall and began a captive breeding programme. In 2012, the red-billed choughs were living <b>free</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> central valley area of Durrell Wildlife Park, and the Trust expects colonisation of the coastal areas of Jersey in the following years.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} {{discover}} his nemesis's secret identity, Osborn exposes Spider-Man to a gas that nullifies the hero's spider-senses. This allows Osborn to stalk Spider-Man until he learns that his nemesis is Peter Parker, {{a college student}} (and his son's classmate). While Parker is going about his civilian life, Osborn surprises and knocks him out with an asphyxiation grenade, taking him to his waterfront base. After unmasking himself to Parker, the latter goads him into recounting how he became Green Goblin, and uses the time to break <b>free.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> ensuing battle, Spider-Man accidentally knocks Osborn into a mass of electrical wires, wiping out his memory. Feeling sorry for his nemesis, and wishing to avoid the shame that would befall the Osborn family (and by extension, Parker's best friend Harry), Spider-Man destroys the Green Goblin costume in the resulting fire and tells the authorities that Osborn lost his memory while helping to defeat the Green Goblin.|$|E
5|$|The gastrovascular cavity {{itself is}} divided {{into a number of}} {{chambers}} by mesenteries radiating inwards from the body wall. Some of the mesenteries form complete partitions with a free edge {{at the base of the}} pharynx, where they connect, but others reach only partway across. The mesenteries are usually found in multiples of twelve, and are symmetrically arranged around the central lumen. They have stomach lining on both sides, separated by a thin layer of mesoglea, and include filaments of tissue specialised for secreting digestive enzymes. In some species, these filaments extend below the lower margin of the mesentery, hanging <b>free</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gastrovascular cavity as thread-like acontial filaments. These acontia are armed with nematocysts and can be extruded through cinclides, blister-like holes in the wall of the column, for use in defence.|$|E
