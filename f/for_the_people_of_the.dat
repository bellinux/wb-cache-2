It was a center of supplies and news <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rogue, who awaited the arrival of the fall provision ship with anticipation and anxiety, for this vessel was the only source of winter provisions. It provided Hume, the employer of the great majority of the citizens of Gold Beach and Wedderburn, with a means of repossessing the wages of his employees and of profiting on the exchange.|$|E
5|$|When {{the region}} of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a {{supporter}} of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new nation. The war ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took its toll, he appealed {{to the people of}} Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car accident left him partially disabled.|$|E

5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, they are called inunnguaq.|$|E

25|$|The parish {{was founded}} in 1914 coinciding with the {{subdivision}} of local market gardens and agistment paddocks as Melbourne's suburbs expanded. Although the larger churches of All Saints' East St Kilda, St Mary's Caulfield and Holy Trinity Balaclava were nearby, the Archbishop of Melbourne, Lowther Clarke, responded positively to petitioners for a new parish and determined that there was sufficient support {{for the establishment of}} another parish in the easternmost part of what was then St Kilda. Prior to the establishment of the parish, All Saints' East St Kilda had provided the outreach of the Leslie Street Mission Hall <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> area from 15 October 1896 until sometime in 1911.|$|E
25|$|There was a minster {{church at}} Keynsham by the ninth century. In the 12th century Keynsham Abbey was founded {{and served as}} the place of worship for the town.

The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of Keynsham Abbey, was rebuilt in 1470. The site of the abbey was bought by Sir Henry Bridges in 1552 and, along with his descendants, held the advowson of the church until the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|The bid was {{launched}} {{at a moment}} when there were strong pressures from Indonesian football fans for Halid to step down from his position as chairman of PSSI. There was no official support from the government of Indonesia until 9 February 2010, the deadline for the country's government to file a letter of support for the bid. Secretary General of PSSI Nugraha Besoes did not deny that Indonesia could be disqualified from the bidding process because the Indonesian government did not support the bid. On 19 March 2010, FIFA rejected Indonesia's bid to host the 2022 World Cup because the government stated that their concern is <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> country and so could not support the bid as FIFA requested. As a consequence, PSSI threw their support behind Australia's bid for the 2022 tournament.|$|E

Gaza's port, however, occasionally succumbed to neglect under Arab rule and an overall decline in commerce followed because of infighting among Palestine's rulers and Bedouin bandits who disrupted overland trade routes towards the city.|$|E

500|$|In a {{conversation}} {{on the morning of}} July 23, Welles asked Henderson to prepare a press release [...] "expressing sympathy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baltic States and condemnation of the Soviet action."

In the presence of Henderson, Welles called Roosevelt and read the draft to him. Roosevelt and Welles agreed that it needed strengthening. Welles then reformulated several sentences and added others which apparently had been suggested by the President. According to Henderson, [...] "President Roosevelt was indignant at {{the manner in which the}} Soviet Union annexed the Baltic States and personally approved the condemnatory statement issued by Under Secretary Welles on the subject."
