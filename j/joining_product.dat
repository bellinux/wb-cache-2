40|$|Melastoma malabathricum L. is an Al-accumulating {{plant that}} grows well in acidic soils with {{high level of}} soluble {{aluminum}} in the tropics. One of the important proteins in the detoxifying Al stress is a plasma membrane H+-ATPase, a most abundant protein on the plasma membrane, encoded by PMA gene. The objective {{of this research was}} to isolate and characterize the gene encoding plasma membrane H+-ATPase from M. malabathricum L. Full length cDNA of MmPMA had been successfully isolated through a gradual isolation of the gene. The 5  end and middle part of the MmPMA gene had been successfully isolated by PCR by using total cDNA as template and pma primers designed from some plants, while the 3  end of Mmpma had been isolated by 3  RACE. The parts of the gene had been successfully joined by PCR. The <b>joining</b> <b>product</b> was successfully inserted into pGEM-T Easy and the recombinant plasmid was successfully introduced into E. coli DH 5 Î±. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that the length of MmPMA coding sequence was 2, 871 bp encoding 956 amino acids with molecular weight of 105. 29 kDa and a predicted pI value of 6. 84. Local alignment analysis based on nucleotide of mRNA showed that MmPMA is 82 % identical to pma Vitis vinifera; 81 % to pma Juglans regia, pma Populus trichocarpa, pma Sesbania rostrata, and pma Prunus persica and 80 % to pma Lycopersicon esculentum. Based on deduced amino acid sequence, MmPMA is 94 % identical to PMA Vitis vinifera and PMA Juglans regia; 93 % to PMA Populus trichocarpa; 92 % to PMA Vicia faba, Lycopersicon esculentum, and Arabidopsis thaliana, AHA 4.

We study one important type of skew, <b>join</b> <b>product</b> skew (JPS). A static approach based on frequency classes is proposed which takes for granted the data distribution of join attribute values. It comes from the observation that the join selectivity can be expressed as a sum of products of frequencies of the join attribute values. As a consequence, an appropriate assignment of join sub-tasks that takes into consideration the magnitude of the frequency products can alleviate the <b>join</b> <b>product</b> skew.

40|$|Although many skew-handling {{algorithms}} {{have been}} proposed for simple join operations, they remain generally inecient {{in the case of}} theta-join {{and in the case of}} multi-join. A new method for self-balancing equi-join operations on shared-nothing (SN) machines is proposed here. It offers deterministic and near-perfect load balancing through exible control of communications in intra-transaction parallelism. The new algorithm mixes a balanced data-distribution strategy with pure hash-join. Its predictably low join-product- and attribute-value skews make it suitable for repeated use in multi-join operations. Its tradeoff between balancing overhead and speedup is analyzed in the BSP (Bulk-synchronous parallel) computing model. The scalable model predicts a negligible <b>join</b> <b>product</b> skew and a near-linear speed-up in any combination of selectivity, skew and number of processors. This prediction is confirmed by a series of tests...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a novel architecture for parallel database processing called Multi-Wavelength Optical Content Addressable Parallel Processor (MW-OCAPP). MW-OCAPP {{is designed to}} provide efficient parallel retrieval and processing of data by moving the bulk of database operations from electronics to optics. It combines a parallel model of computation with the many degrees of processing freedom that light provides. MW-OCAPP uses a polarization and wavelength-encoding scheme to achieve a high level of parallelism. Distinctive features of the proposed architecture include (1) the use of a multiple-wavelength encoding scheme to enhance processing parallelism, (2) multiple-comparand word-parallel and bit-parallel magnitude comparison with an execution-time independent of the data size or word size, (3) the implementation of a suite of eleven database primitives, and (4) multi-comparand two-dimensional data processing.
