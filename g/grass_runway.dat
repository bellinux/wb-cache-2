5|$|On 11 July 1965. Avro 748 G-ARMV of Skyways Coach-Air {{arriving}} from Beauvais was written off at Lympne when its nose-wheels dug into soft {{ground on the}} <b>grass</b> <b>runway.</b> The aircraft flipped over, losing its port wing in the process.|$|E
5|$|Lympne {{returned}} to civilian use on 1 January 1946. In 1948, the first air ferry service was inaugurated at Lympne by Silver City Airways. Problems with waterlogging of the <b>grass</b> <b>runway</b> and {{the refusal of}} the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation to upgrade the airfield led to Silver City transferring operations to Lydd (Ferryfield) in 1954. By 1956, the airport's ownership had passed to Eric Rylands Ltd, the Skyways holding company. Skyways operated a coach-air service between London and Paris, flying passengers from Lympne to Beauvais. This service operated until 1974 (1955–1958: the original Skyways; 1958–1971: Skyways Coach-Air; 1971–1972: Skyways International; 1972–1974: Dan-Air Skyways). Following the cessation of commercial operations in October 1974, Lympne continued {{to be used as}} a General Aviation airfield until about 1984. The site is now an industrial estate.|$|E
5|$|On 30 January 1953, Braathens SAFE {{applied to}} start a route from Oslo to Trondheim Airport, Lade. A trial permit was granted, and the first flight was made on 18 August. Because Lade had a <b>grass</b> <b>runway,</b> Trondheim Airport, Værnes was used during bad weather. SAS flew a morning flight from Oslo, while Braathens flew the morning route from Trondheim. In 1953, Braathens SAFE stated that to keep their 210 {{employees}} and fleet of one DC-4, one DC-3 and two Herons, {{they would have to}} receive future domestic services, to compensate for more than 90% of their revenue disappearing with the loss of the Far East route. In 1953, Braathens SAFE applied to fly five routes: Bardufoss – Alta – Kirkenes; Stavanger – Bergen – Trondheim (both with Herons); Tromsø – Alta – Hammerfest; Bodø – Harstad; and Bodø – Harstad – Tromsø (all with de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otters). The five routes would require NOK725,000 in annual subsidies. The concessions were granted to DNL, who allowed their partially owned subsidiary Widerøe to fly the sea routes.|$|E

25|$|Rongotai Airport {{started with}} a <b>grass</b> <b>runway</b> in November 1929. The airport opened in 1935, but was closed down due to safety reasons on 27 September 1947 (grass surface often became {{unusable}} during winter months). During the closure, Paraparaumu Airport, 35 miles north of Wellington, was Wellington's airport, and became the country's busiest airport in 1949.|$|E

25|$|During its {{greatest}} extent during the Second World War, the air base {{consisted of a}} <b>grass</b> <b>runway</b> measuring , stretching from Bekken to Øvrevann. The runway had landing lights. There were twenty single-aircraft hangars, of which eight were hardened aircraft shelters. There were two air defense positions, one at Elvevoll and one at Heggelund. The armored unit was located at Brattørveita, just northeast of the airport. There were trenches located around the airfield to defend against a land-based attack.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1993, upon {{approach}} for landing on <b>Grass</b> <b>Runway</b> 22, a Glasflügel H-101 glider registered N101AZ, encountered a powered airplane, which {{had entered the}} landing pattern. The pilot extended his base leg to the approach to accommodate the aircraft. He then decided {{that it would be}} difficult to complete the landing on the planned runway, so he switched to a site he was unfamiliar with. During this landing, the glider impacted a ditch. The ultra-light aircraft suffered damage to its tail section.|$|E
25|$|The 1965 Skyways Coach-Air Avro 748 crash {{occurred}} on 10 July 1965 when Avro 748-101 Series 1 G-ARMV, flown during a scheduled international passenger flight from Beauvais Airport, Oise, France, crashed on landing at its intended destination of Lympne Airport, Kent, United Kingdom. The accident {{was due to}} the <b>grass</b> <b>runway</b> being unable to support the weight of the aircraft during a heavy landing. This caused the nose wheels to dig in and the aircraft to overturn, losing both wings and the starboard tailplane in the process. All 52 people on board survived. This was the first accident involving the Avro 748/HS 748 that resulted in a write-off. A concrete runway was later installed at Lympne.|$|E

25|$|No.3 Service Flying Training School (No.3 SFTS) {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Amberley, Queensland, on 21September 1940. Its inaugural {{commanding}} officer was Wing Commander R.H. Simms. Amberley had only opened that year, {{and when the}} first course of flying training commenced with CAC Wirraways on 19November, the aircraft were operating off a <b>grass</b> <b>runway.</b> This soon proved impractical, however, owing to heavy downpours. To keep flying on schedule, No.3 SFTS instituted a 13-hour training day coupled with nightly aircraft maintenance, and the Wirraways frequently used the airfields at nearby RAAF Stations Archerfield and Maryborough, homes of No.2 Elementary Flying Training School and No.3 Wireless Air Gunners School, respectively. The school also operated twin-engined Avro Ansons, on which training was hampered {{not only by the}} condition of the airfield but by shortages of aircraft and instructors. On 4March 1941, two of the Ansons collided in mid-air near Casino, New South Wales, during a cross-country training flight. One of the Ansons crashed and the pilot was killed, though his co-pilot managed to bail out; the other Anson was only slightly damaged and landed at Casino Aerodrome.|$|E
