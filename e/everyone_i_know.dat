That is what makes the Peace-at-any-price campaign so exasperating. It is like being chased by clamorous geese across a common in the direction in which you want to go. But how are we to get out--with any credit--in such a way as to prevent a subsequent collapse into another war as frightful? ...|$|E

5000|$|In this {{alternative}} form, the fallacy {{is described as}} a specific form of the [...] "similar to me" [...] stereotype: what is unknown about another person is assumed, for simplicity, using things the observer knows about himself or herself.

For example, [...] "I (or <b>everyone</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> or most people I know) don't know very much about chemistry. Therefore I can assume that this other person knows very little about chemistry." [...] This assumption may be true in any number of specific cases, making inductive reasoning based on this assumption cogent, but is not applicable in the general case (there are many people who are very knowledgeable in the field of chemistry), and therefore deductive reasoning based on this assumption may be invalid.|$|E

40|$|I can’t {{quite believe}} that it was almost ten years ago that I was raving to <b>everyone</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> about an {{independent}} film from England called Sexy Beast. The great Ray Winstone (who began his career on TV in Robin of Sherwood, of all things) gave a bravura performance as Gal, a retired British criminal living on the Costa del Sol, laying low and enjoying the sunshine. Into his idyllic retirement came the terrifying Don – a genuinely frightening Ben Kingsley – whose mission was to entice Gal back to Blighty for one last job. The fireworks began there and didn’t let up for another 100 minutes; Sexy Beast was the most bracing, hilarious, tense and unmissable film about British criminality and masculinity to come along for years...|$|R

Hibbs also approached Pollak, proposing her a position as an hourly drawing and painting teacher.

Additionally, most people think that choice is a good thing and so the fact that pretty much everyone on this globe wants to learn English becomes a good thing by implication. The fact that so many people clamor for English is particularly convenient for the TESOL industry because it allows us to collectively pretend that English teaching is not just a job or, heaven forbid, that we are actually little cogs serving the advancement of corporate imperialism. On the contrary, we like to think that TESOL is actually helping people to learn the language of their choice, and thus to achieve all the goodies that are supposed to come with it, be it democracy or development...|$|E

40|$|Now, {{that you}} have started with Haskell, have you written a program doing IO yet, like reading a file or writing on the terminal? Then you have used the IO monad — but do you {{understand}} how it works? The standard explanation is, that the IO monad hides the non-functional IO actions —which do have side effects — from the functional world of Haskell. It prevents pollution of the functional programming style with side effects. However, since most beginning Haskell programmers (i. e., <b>everyone</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> and including me) lack knowledge about category theory, they have no clue about what a monad really is. Nor how this “hiding ” works, apart from having IO actions disappearing {{beyond the borders of}} our knowledge. This report scratches the surface of category theory, an abstract branch of algebra, just deep enough to find the monad structure. On the way we discuss the relations to the purely func-tional programming language Haskell. Finally it should become clear how the IO monad keeps Haskell pure. We do not explain how to use the IO monad, nor discuss all the functions available to the pro...|$|E

40|$|Object loss, {{along with}} trauma, are {{concepts}} dear {{to us as}} psychoanalysts. My own work with these topics, and my experience of great losses early in life, make me something of an expert, but I rarely find myself {{in the literature on}} the subject. This reaction has given me cause for the reflections that are the subject of this essay. A previous reflection called “The Babel of Trauma, ” in which I examined the current literature on the subject, ended up in the proverbial drawer, forgotten, partly out of doubts that my criticism of well-established theories could be justified. Recently, however, I was encouraged to re-examine my response the theories of trauma in general and object loss specifically. I had the unforgettable experience of recounting the losses I suffered during World War II in an address to a large audience at the International Psychoanalytical Association Congress in Berlin, where I was accorded the warmest reception imaginable.
