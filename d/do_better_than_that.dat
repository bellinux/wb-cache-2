2500|$|Thompson: Just {{hold your}} men here. [...] I think I can <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
60|$|LAWSON. For it? for it, William? Ye're {{perfectly}} richt there. (To LESLIE.) Just {{you do what}} William tells you; ye canna <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you want}} to give me the slip,' he chuckled, 'you must <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> I can see you {{bringing}} the Nugget back to the school.' ...|$|E
60|$|Neither you nor I {{could have}} <b>done</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> {{even if we}} had been strong enough.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{have seen}} your sister. And I have <b>done</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> I have seen your father. Lord Silverbridge,--behold your brother-in-law." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{that is not}} the Genoese way, nor ours either," [...] {{the captain}} said. [...] "We <b>did</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> signor. We recaptured her, and carried her off from under their noses." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You can <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> I've {{seen you}} run {{like a young}} buck-rabbit. Ask Dickson from me to try you as three-quarter next game, will you? Cut along.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You hurt Porter {{about as}} much as I hurt Basswood," [...] Plum grumbled. [...] "If you can't <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> next time, you had better give up trying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> mother dear. I'll go to {{the spring}} for a full bucket, and when it has been {{strained}} we shall have what will be an improvement on rainwater." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; she saw {{you in some}} {{hotel or}} street {{for a minute or}} two while you were away travelling, and accidentally heard your name; and when she made some remark about you, Miss Ellis--that's her maid--told her you was on your wedding-tower with Mr. Melbury's daughter; and she said, 'He ought to have <b>done</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> I fear he has spoiled his chances,' she says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Whining are you?' said Sikes. 'Come! Don't stand snivelling there. If you can't <b>do</b> {{anything}} <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> cut off altogether. D'ye hear me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} you could <b>do</b> it <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> yourself, Larry," [...] said Ned, laughing. [...] "Come along, now, close at our heels, lest we get {{separated}} in the crowd." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Infant humbug, sir,' replied Mr Folair. 'There isn't {{a female}} child of common {{sharpness}} in a charity school, that couldn't <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> She may thank her stars {{she was born}} a manager's daughter.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No; I will <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> I {{will give}} you five and twenty guineas each {{when we get to}} Amsterdam, and I {{will give you}} another twenty-five each if I come back here safe and sound." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor do I," [...] said Winters; [...] "in fact, I {{regard it}} as adding insult to injury. Mr. Wiegand you've got to <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> You are not the man who can pull wool over my eyes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If they can't <b>do</b> any <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> we shan't {{have much}} to worry us. What do they take us for, I wonder? Farmers? Playing off a comic-supplement bluff like that on us!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Gordon, perhaps. But our Nelsons and Napiers and Havelocks-- {{to think}} that we could <b>do</b> no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> for them! Now, dear, we have seen the man--let us look at the house!' ...|$|R
60|$|Reader, we can <b>do</b> no <b>better</b> <b>than</b> echo <b>that</b> sentiment, {{and wish}} you a kind farewell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I can <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> if {{you wish}} to visit the Paradise," [...] responded the bluejay; [...] "for the Guardian of the Entrance is a special friend of mine, and will do {{whatever}} I ask him to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A clumsy effort that, of course," [...] he admitted, [...] "especially {{when your}} father has a detective always round the place. He is well guarded, but I think that you could <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> if you would, Miss Duge." ...|$|E
60|$|Lanigan {{gazed at}} Mrs. Cristie and her companion. If that charming young widow wanted some one to walk about {{with her in}} the moonlight, she could surely <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> Perhaps a {{diversion}} might be effected and partners changed.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no; I do not bid you. Mind, I do not bid you. I {{will not}} have it <b>done.</b> <b>Better</b> {{anything}} <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> while it may yet be avoided. I have your promise; have I not?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{impact of}} the single belied its {{relatively}} low position in Billboard, rising to number 7 and number 8 in the charts collated and published by rival trade papers Record World and Cash Box, respectively. It brought something of a media comeback for the Beach Boys, invited to appear on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson and several other New York talk shows. It placed at #8 on the major playlists of New York City, and <b>did</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> in Chicago (#1), Calgary (#2), Los Angeles (#3), San Diego and Louisville (#4), Toronto (#5), Boston and Buffalo (#6), Washington DC (#7), Detroit and Cincinnati (#8).|$|R
6000|$|... "Been unfort'nate, have you? I'm {{sorry for}} that; but it 'pears to me them as stays {{to home and}} works stiddy <b>does</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> them <b>that</b> goes huntin' after luck," [...] {{observed}} Aunt Liddy, feeling it her duty to give a word of advice.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> Fred," [...] was the reply. [...] "I'll skate down to Rockville {{the first thing}} in the morning and send Ruth and her folks a telegram. There is nothing like {{striking}} while the iron is hot." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We can <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> lad," [...] Pierre cried, {{catching}} me by {{the shoulder}} as if a sudden thought had just come into his mind. [...] "Look about you as we run, and if so be your eyes light upon a pick or an axe, seize upon it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fat enough;--and {{what she}} lacks in {{fairness}} may be added {{on to the}} forty; but if she were less ambitious and had a glimmer of taste, she might <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> You see that girl with the green scarf round her? She is young and good-looking. Why should she spring about like a bear on a hot iron?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} have <b>done</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> at a hundred yards," [...] Mr. Atherton said. [...] "You two lads {{ought to have}} practised a little more {{steadily}} than you have. It was Grimstone brought down that man. His rifle went off a second before yours, and the man was falling when you fired. The great thing in firing at natives is that every shot should tell. It is the certainty of the thing that scares them. If they hear bullets singing about with only occasionally a man dropping they gain confidence, but a slow, steady fire with every shot telling shakes their nerves, and makes them very careful of showing themselves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harriet," [...] said Mr. Archibald, {{suddenly}} twisting {{himself so}} that {{he sat on the}} side of the bed, [...] "your idea is a most admirable one. It suits me exactly. Let us run away. It is impossible for us to <b>do</b> anything <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> Have you told Margery?" ...|$|R
5000|$|An early example {{proposed}} by McCarthy & Prince (1994) is the constraint NoCoda, which prohibits syllables from ending in consonants. In Balangao, NoCoda is not ranked {{high enough to}} be always obeyed, as witnessed in roots like [...] (faithfulness to the input prevents deletion of the final /n/). But, in the reduplicated form [...] 'repeatedly be left behind', the final /n/ is not copied. Under McCarthy & Prince's analysis, this is because faithfulness to the input {{does not apply to}} reduplicated material, and NoCoda is thus free to prefer [...] over hypothetical [...] (which has an additional violation of NoCoda). Constraints are also violable; the winning candidate need not satisfy all constraints, as long as for any rival candidate <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the winner on some constraint, there is a higher ranked constraint on which the winner <b>does</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> rival.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{take them}} at par, of course,--and as we sell we shall pay for them. But {{of course we}} shall only sell at a premium. If we can run them up even to 110, there would be three hundred {{thousand}} dollars. But we'll <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> I must try and see Melmotte at once. You had better write a letter now.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He can <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> my dear," [...] exclaimed Lady Persiflage; [...] "and, {{if you are}} to be his wife, I am {{sure that}} you will not {{stand in the way of}} his promotion. His own Government and ours between them will be able to do {{something}} for him as Duca di Crinola, whereas nothing could be done for George Roden." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} to offer to pay at once for two minutes more when a better idea struck me. Talk with Napoleon? I'd <b>do</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> I'd call a whole War Council of great spirits, lay the war crisis before them and get the biggest brains that the world ever {{produced}} to work on how to win the war.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father,' said Nuttie, {{trembling}} with the effort, 'I {{want you to}} <b>do</b> something <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> I want you to let Mark take the agency {{with a view to}} himself--not me. Let him be as he would have been if he had never hunted us up at Micklethwayte, and put me in his place.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This ring, Madonna," [...] said I, [...] "was {{given me}} by the Lord Cesare Borgia, and was to have proved a talisman to open wide for me the door to fortune. It <b>did</b> <b>better</b> service <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> Madonna. It was the talisman that saved you from your pursuers that day at Cagli, three years ago." ...|$|R
50|$|Since {{the same}} Prover cannot <b>do</b> any <b>better</b> <b>than</b> send <b>that</b> same message. Thus, this holds whether i is even or odd and the proof that IP ⊆ PSPACE is complete.|$|R
